# Notes

## News pipeline

What can I really do with news?

- Identify any history of layoffs?
- Identify any history of fundraising?
- Cluster news:
    - Group articles that are about the same things
    - Identify the article clusters into threads like business deals/collaboration, fundraising, scandal, layoffs, application/product update?

## Issues

- fear of getting blocked by Google
- bs4 page extractor is maybe 80% reliable

### Technical issues

- Unable to install textpipe, either via pip or pipenv
- Somehow command-line pipenv started pulling from the .venv that VSCode created so I had to point to that.

## TODO

- nicely formatted HTML output so I can read the sources if I want to, etc

## Things that I like

- NER summarization gets some useful info:
    - S6/Palia: Steam, Switch, Epic games, Daybreak Studios, CEOs
    - 98point6: CEO, Bright.md, a few others
    - Pomelo: Funding amount (sorta), investors maybe

# User research questions

- What types of things do you research before applying to a company?
- What types of things do you research before a full loop?
- What do you investigate after receiving an offer but before accepting it?
