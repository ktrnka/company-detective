# About 98point6

98point6 is a Seattle-based health tech company founded on March 1, 2015. The company initially operated as a virtual primary care provider but has since pivoted to focus on licensing its telehealth software to healthcare providers. The company combines deep technology with the expertise of board-certified physicians to provide text-based care anytime, anywhere via a mobile app. 

98point6 has raised approximately $300 million in venture capital, with significant funding rounds including $118 million in late 2020 ([Crunchbase, 2024](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/98point6)). The company generates revenue through a B2B model, licensing its software to healthcare providers and forming strategic partnerships. Notable partnerships include a collaboration with SteadyMD to provide a comprehensive virtual care solution ([SteadyMD, October 2023](https://www.steadymd.com/blog/98point6-technologies-collaborates-with-steadymd-to-offer-comprehensive-virtual-care-solution-to-healthcare-organizations/)).

The company has undergone significant changes over time, including a shift from direct healthcare services to a licensing model for its virtual care software. This transition has involved layoffs and strategic acquisitions, such as the purchase of Bright.md's remaining assets to enhance its asynchronous care capabilities ([PR Newswire, January 2024](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html)).

### Company Overview
**98point6 Technologies** is a Seattle-based health tech company founded in 2015. Initially, it operated as a virtual primary care provider but has since pivoted to focus on licensing its telehealth software to healthcare providers.

#### Recent Developments
1. **Acquisition of Bright.md**: On January 16, 2024, 98point6 announced the acquisition of Bright.md's remaining assets, which will enhance its asynchronous care capabilities. This acquisition is part of a broader strategy to expand its virtual care offerings ([PR Newswire, January 2024](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html)).

3. **Layoffs and Business Model Transformation**: In April 2024, 98point6 underwent significant layoffs as part of its transition to a licensing model for its software solutions. This shift follows the sale of its virtual care operations to Transcarent and reflects broader challenges in the health tech sector ([Pragmatic DLT, April 2024](https://pragmaticdlt.com/news/98point6-undergoes-significant-workforce-reduction-amid-business-model-transformation/)).

### Market Challenges and Opportunities

However, the demand for virtual care solutions continues to grow, presenting opportunities for 98point6 to expand its market share through strategic acquisitions and partnerships.

### Conclusion
98point6 Technologies is navigating a transformative phase as it shifts from direct healthcare services to a licensing model for its virtual care software. With recent acquisitions and partnerships, the company is well-positioned to enhance its offerings and address the evolving needs of healthcare providers and patients.
