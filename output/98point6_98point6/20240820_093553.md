# About 98point6

98point6 is a digital healthcare company founded on March 1, 2015, and headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The company provides a virtual care platform that combines deep technology with the expertise of board-certified physicians to deliver personalized consultation, diagnosis, and treatment to patients via a mobile app. Initially, 98point6 offered direct healthcare services but has since pivoted to a licensing model, allowing healthcare organizations to utilize its technology to enhance their virtual care offerings.

The company operates primarily on a B2B model, licensing its virtual care software to healthcare organizations. This shift in business strategy aims to provide more sustainable revenue streams and adapt to the evolving healthcare landscape. The company has raised a total of $299 million in funding, with significant investments in 2020 and 2023 ([Crunchbase, 2024](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/98point6)).

## 98point6 Technologies: Company and Product Overview

### Company Overview
**Name:** 98point6 Technologies  
**Founded:** 2015  
**Headquarters:** Seattle, Washington  
**Business Model:** Licensing of virtual care software  
**Key Personnel:**  
- **Jay Burrell** - CEO of 98point6 Technologies

98point6 Technologies is a leader in the virtual care software space, focusing on providing licensed on-demand virtual care solutions. The company has pivoted from direct healthcare services to a licensing model, allowing healthcare organizations to utilize its technology to enhance their virtual care offerings. This strategic shift comes in response to evolving market demands and financial pressures within the health tech industry.

#### Recent Developments
1. **Acquisition of Bright.md**  
   On January 16, 2024, 98point6 announced the acquisition of Bright.md's remaining assets, which will enhance its asynchronous care capabilities. This acquisition is part of a broader strategy to integrate more robust virtual care delivery options into its platform ([PR Newswire, January 16, 2024](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html)).

2. **Partnership with SteadyMD**  
   In October 2023, 98point6 formed a strategic partnership with SteadyMD to provide a comprehensive virtual care solution. This collaboration aims to help healthcare organizations manage patient workloads and reduce clinician burnout by combining 98point6's technology with SteadyMD's network of clinicians ([SteadyMD, October 9, 2023](https://www.steadymd.com/blog/98point6-technologies-collaborates-with-steadymd-to-offer-comprehensive-virtual-care-solution-to-healthcare-organizations/)).

3. **Workforce Reductions**  
   In April 2024, 98point6 underwent significant layoffs as part of its business model transformation. This decision reflects the company's ongoing adjustments to streamline operations and focus on its licensing strategy ([Pragmatic DLT, April 24, 2024](https://pragmaticdlt.com/news/98point6-undergoes-significant-workforce-reduction-amid-business-model-transformation/)).

### Product Overview
**Product Name:** 98point6 Technology Platform  
**Type:** Virtual care software  
**Features:**
- **Asynchronous Care Module:** Allows providers to communicate with patients at their convenience, enhancing flexibility and reducing clinician burnout.
- **AI-Enhanced Tools:** The platform utilizes machine learning to support clinical decision-making, intake, diagnosis, and care documentation.
- **Integration Capabilities:** The software can integrate with existing electronic health record (EHR) systems, providing a seamless experience for healthcare organizations.

The 98point6 Technology Platform is designed to empower healthcare providers by offering tools that enhance patient engagement and operational efficiency. The platform is built to support a wide range of medical conditions and is tailored to meet the needs of various healthcare organizations.

#### Market Position
98point6 operates in a competitive landscape that includes other telehealth providers such as Teladoc Health and Amwell. The company has positioned itself as a technology provider rather than a direct care provider, which may offer more sustainable revenue streams in the current economic climate ([CB Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/98point6)).

### Financial Overview
- **Funding History:** 98point6 raised $118 million in late 2020, which significantly contributed to its growth during the pandemic. However, the company has faced challenges in maintaining its workforce and adapting to market changes since then ([Pragmatic DLT, April 24, 2024](https://pragmaticdlt.com/news/98point6-undergoes-significant-workforce-reduction-amid-business-model-transformation/)).
- **Recent Acquisitions:** The acquisition of Bright.md is expected to enhance the company's product offerings and market reach, although the financial details of the deal were not disclosed ([Healthcare Dive, January 17, 2024](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/98point6-buys-bright-md-assets/704661/)).

### Opinions and Market Sentiment
The shift towards a licensing model has been viewed as a necessary adaptation to the changing healthcare landscape. While this strategy may provide more stable revenue, it raises concerns about job security for employees and the overall stability of the company in a competitive market ([Pragmatic DLT, April 24, 2024](https://pragmaticdlt.com/news/98point6-undergoes-significant-workforce-reduction-amid-business-model-transformation/)).

#### Key Quotes
- **Jay Burrell, CEO:** "Our mission at 98point6 is to build market leading technology that empowers healthcare providers with the tools they need to broaden access, enhance patient engagement, and achieve cost savings through greater provider efficiency." ([PR Newswire, January 16, 2024](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html))

### Conclusion
98point6 Technologies is navigating a transformative period as it shifts its focus from direct healthcare services to a technology licensing model. The recent acquisition of Bright.md and partnership with SteadyMD are strategic moves aimed at enhancing its product offerings and addressing the challenges faced by healthcare organizations.
