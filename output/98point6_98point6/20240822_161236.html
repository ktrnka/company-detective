        <h1>About 98point6</h1>
<p>98point6, founded on March 1, 2015, is a Seattle-based company specializing in digital healthcare services.

<p>The company combines advanced technology with the expertise of board-certified physicians to provide text-based care anytime, anywhere.

<h2>Comprehensive Analyst Report on 98point6 Technologies and its Product</h2>
<h3>Company Overview: 98point6 Technologies</h3>
<p>98point6 Technologies, founded in 2015 and based in Seattle, is a leader in licensed on-demand virtual care software. The company initially operated as a virtual primary care provider but has pivoted to focus on licensing its telehealth technology to healthcare providers. This strategic shift was solidified by the sale of its virtual care and primary care operations to Transcarent for up to $100 million in 2023. The company has raised approximately $300 million in funding as of early 2023, with a significant funding round of $118 million in late 2020 (<a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/98point6-buys-bright-md-assets/704661/">Healthcare Dive, January 2024</a>).</p>
<h4>Key Personnel</h4>

</ul>
<h4>Partnerships</h4>
<ul>

</ul>
<h4>Layoffs and Business Model Transformation</h4>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>Product Overview: 98point6 Technology Platform</h3>
<p>The flagship product of 98point6 is its cloud-based technology platform, which integrates artificial intelligence with automated practice standards and electronic health record (EHR) systems. The platform includes:
- <strong>Clinician Console</strong>: A physician-facing interface that streamlines patient visits and documentation.
- <strong>Patient-Facing App</strong>: A white-labeled application that allows patients to access care easily.
- <strong>Asynchronous Care Module</strong>: Newly developed to enable providers to communicate with patients at their convenience, enhancing flexibility and reducing clinician burnout (<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html">PR Newswire, January 2024</a>).</p>
<h4>Market Position and User Base</h4>

<h3>Financial Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Funding</strong>: 98point6 has raised approximately $300 million in total funding, with a notable round of $118 million in late 2020. The company is currently valued at around $2.2 billion following its acquisition by Transcarent (<a href="https://medcitynews.com/2024/05/glen-tullman-has-no-interest-in-selling-transcarent-but-ipo-is-a-possibility/">MedCity News, May 2024</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Model</strong>: The company has shifted from direct patient care to a licensing model, which is expected to provide more stable and recurring revenue streams.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Opinions and Market Sentiment</h3>
<p>The sentiment around 98point6 is mixed, with some praising its innovative approach to virtual care while others express concerns about its recent layoffs and strategic pivots. The acquisition of Bright.md and partnership with SteadyMD are seen as positive steps towards enhancing its product offerings and market reach. However, the layoffs raise questions about the company's operational stability and employee morale (<a href="https://pragmaticdlt.com/news/98point6-undergoes-significant-workforce-reduction-amid-business-model-transformation/">Pragmatic DLT, April 2024</a>).</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>98point6 Technologies is navigating a transformative phase as it pivots towards a licensing model for its virtual care technology. The recent acquisition of Bright.md and partnership with SteadyMD position the company for growth in the evolving healthcare landscape. However, the impact of layoffs and strategic shifts on its workforce and service delivery remains a critical area to watch for prospective candidates and investors. The company's commitment to enhancing patient and clinician experiences through innovative technology continues to be a focal point of its mission. </p>
