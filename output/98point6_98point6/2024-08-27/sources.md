Asynchronous care, or âasync,â is a type of virtual care with no scheduling requirements, giving the patient the flexibility and convenience to seek care for non-urgent concerns whenever and wherever theyâd like. Whereas a response from a provider may occur quickly, there is no real-time interaction between the patient and the medical staff. This type of dedicated care also helps with capturing revenue by incorporating patient messages from a provider’s inbox back into the patient chart to enhance the continuity of care. 98point6 can support your clinicians in asynchronously diagnosing and treating more than 140 common conditions for patients across all agesâfrom pediatrics to geriatrics.

Our AI-powered solution leverages evidence-based clinical content, machine learning, and automation to recommend the optimal care option, while also giving patients the ability to choose the format they prefer. Customizable to the specific workflow of the healthcare organization, the clinician can direct the patient to real-time care or prompt them to seek in-person care if their medical concern cannot be treated asynchronously.

Real-time virtual care can consist of text-based messaging, audio, or video interactions, or any combination of the three. Additionally, real-time care can be facilitated as an on-demand or scheduled visit. On-demand visits allow patients to immediately start a visit, any time, from anywhere. Patients can report symptoms and concerns and our product gathers relevant history, before connecting the patient to a clinician. Wait times in the queue are dependent on clinician availability. ScheduledÂ visits allow patients to choose a date and time in the future that is most convenient for them.

Our patient intake automates much of the administrative tasks associated with taking a history. Our product is trained, based on millions of patient encounters, to respond to patient-reported symptoms with question sets, written by physicians, that elicit relevant clinical details for provider review. It works like this: the patient enters their chief complaint as free text. They can write as much or as little as they want to communicate the reason for their visit and their symptoms. The 98point6 platform intakes all of that information and then generates the appropriate follow-up questions.

Our patient intake process significantly reduces the administrative burden on clinicians – and automatically captures an accurate transcript of patient-reported symptoms.

We have been applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to medical encounters since 2015. As a result, we have a vast data set that is one-of-a-kind in the field of natural language processing for medical applications. We utilize Al and machine learning to improve both efficiency and medical quality by automating time-consuming tasks, allowing clinicians to focus their judgment on key decision points in the clinical encounter. Our system provides information and actions for the clinician to consider; however, the clinician is in complete control of the visit diagnosis, and care planning.

Data integration is cornerstone to the 98point6 platform. EMR data can be automatically pulled into the clinician console, and once the visit is complete, data is automatically sent to the EMR to be recorded in the patient’s medical record. Our standards-based integration supports Epic and Cerner, as well as other EMRs. The platform also supports data integrations for analytics, reporting, security and compliance and other administrative needs.

Yes, we used to be affiliated with a virtual clinic â¦

Before the days when video calls and remote meetings were ubiquitous, our team of healthcare experts knew there was a need to expand access to quality care beyond physical spaces. In 2017, 98point6 launched technology that created a 24/7 virtual clinic with on-demand, text-based primary care. Over the years, we refined the platform to:

Integrate with electronic health records

Provide clinical documentation and decision-support tools

Improve provider efficiency

â¦ and now our software is changing healthcare tech.

98point6 is no longer affiliated with a virtual clinic, and in 2023, we evolved to focus our business on building and licensing technology to healthcare organizations. In short, weâve made it even easier for customers to leverage our learnings and experience for their virtual care needs.

The fine print

In spring 2023, Transcarent acquired the 98point6 healthcare delivery division and we reincorporated as 98point6 Technologies â evolving our mission by licensing our technology to healthcare organizations to expand access to care, improve patient engagement, and achieve cost savings. We acquired Bright.md in 2024, which is accelerating that expansion.

Leveraging AI (before it was cool)

Since 2017, 98point6 has developed machine learning models that utilize insights from hundreds of thousands of patient visits and have been seamlessly deployed within our platform. This intelligence engine empowers our system to efficiently prioritize case assignments and equip clinical care teams with instant, one-click text-based options during patient interactions.

Because of our extensive history with AI, we have a vast data set that is one-of-a-kind in the field of natural language processing for medical applications â and these learnings are a key component to our software.

Primary care physicians are the gateway for people to access their care; no matter what the issue, a patient is most likely to see their GP before they see a specialist (often because they have to in order to get a referral).

# [98point6 Technologies Collaborates with SteadyMD to Offer Comprehensive Virtual Care Solution to Healthcare Organizations on 2023-10-07](https://www.98point6.com/press_release/98point6-steadymd/)
Best-in-Class Technology and Highly Trained Clinicians Helps Understaffed Healthcare Organizations Lower Costs, Reduce Burnout and Manage Patient Workloads

SEATTLE, WASHINGTON - October 9, 2023 - 98point6 Technologies, a leader in virtual care software, today announced a new strategic partnership with B2B telehealth infrastructure provider, SteadyMD. Together, these leaders will provide an all-in-one virtual care offering to healthcare organizations that combines 98point6âs cloud-based, licensable technology with SteadyMDâs 50-state network of highly-trained clinicians to help short staffed healthcare organizations lower the unit economic cost of care operations, reduce provider burnout and manage escalating patient workloads.

With an estimated shortage of 200,000 nurses and 50,000 physicians over the next three yearsÂ and with more than 50% of U.S. hospitals operating at a deficit in 2022, health systems face significant financial and operational challenges. The text-first 98point6 Technology Platform, coupled with SteadyMDâs technology, clinical operations and clinician workforce, will enable organizations, such as health systems with in-person care, to create new revenue streams, increase provider efficiency and reduce administrative burdens â making their hybrid and virtual care strategies a reality.

ââ"98point6 Technologies brings a keen understanding of how technology can lower the cost of care while also providing the best patient and provider experiences possible,â said Guy Friedman, co-founder and CEO of SteadyMD. âOur new all-in-one virtual care solution promises to revolutionize healthcare delivery, ensuring providers have the tools and support they need to provide accessible, high-quality patient care.â

The 98point6 Technology Platform provides the backend infrastructure that enables healthcare organizations to innovate and quickly reimagine new economic models at scale. Now bolstered by the expertise of SteadyMD's U.S. board-certified providers, the 98point6 Technology Platform provides a quick and cost-effective way for understaffed healthcare organizations to maintain their competitive edge and boost their bottom line in an ever-evolving marketplace, without needing to increase their current workforce.

Provider-Centric Software Optimizes Efficiency

Developed by a team with a proven track record of building and running a successful nationwide virtual clinic serving millions of patients, the 98point6 Technology Platform stands apart from the flood of provider-centric tools. Based around a flagship Clinician Console, the 98point6 Technology platform is a scalable, cloud-based platform that helps providers conduct efficient, high-quality patient visits.

Built-in logic, in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) and automated clinical support tools, guides providers to quickly make the right medical decisions and provide care for more than 4,000 conditions virtually or seamlessly direct patients to the right in-person follow up care when needed. Automation built into the platform limits care variability, optimizes patient and provider time by streamlining the intake process and reduces cognitive load on clinicians so they can more effectively and efficiently practice at the top of their license.

The SteadyMD clinicians work shoulder to shoulder with a client success team and clinical operations team to deliver effective and efficient clinical care. Through careful planning and monitoring, the team ensures that patients are seen in a timely manner, programs are staffed effectively, and clinicians are trained and confident in their use of the technology platform and their knowledge of customer and use case-tailored clinical protocols.

The 98point6 and SteadyMD offering to healthcare organizations includes:

A digital clinic hosted in the cloud that seamlessly integrates with existing systems including EHRs, and is secure and compliant (HIPAA, SOC 2)

An AI-enhanced patient entry point that can be white-labeled with a healthcare organizationâs brand

A Clinician Console with configurable workflows, automated clinical decision support tools, support for multi-patient chat, and care follow-up and documentation tools

Training and development for clinicians and staff

A 50-state network of clinicians, a client success team and a clinical ops team delivering on-demand and scheduled virtual care

âTogether with SteadyMD, weâre paving new ground by equipping strained healthcare organizations with the tools they need to navigate the complexities of today's healthcare environment,â said Jay Burrell, President and Chief Executive Officer of 98point6 Technologies. âAt 98point6, we believe in being more than a digital health solution; we're a helping hand in transforming the healthcare landscape. This partnership exemplifies that commitment to providing comprehensive support, not just in technology but in redefining the very essence of care delivery.â
