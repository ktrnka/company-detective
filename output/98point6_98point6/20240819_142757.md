# About 98point6

98point6 is a Seattle-based health tech company founded on March 1, 2015. The company initially operated as a virtual primary care provider but has since pivoted to focus on licensing its telehealth software to healthcare providers. The company combines deep technology with the expertise of board-certified physicians to provide text-based care anytime, anywhere. 

98point6 has raised approximately $300 million in venture capital, with significant funding rounds including $118 million in late 2020 ([Healthcare Dive, January 2024](cache://healthcaredive/32)). The company generates revenue through a B2B model, licensing its telehealth software to healthcare organizations. 

The company's products are distributed via a mobile app, which offers private, text-based diagnosis and treatment. The scale of the company includes a broad user base, although specific numbers of customers or users are not disclosed. Over time, 98point6 has shifted from direct patient care to a software licensing model, reflecting its strategic focus on enhancing virtual care delivery.

#### Key Features

### Market Position and Competitors
98point6 operates in a competitive landscape that includes other telehealth providers such as Teladoc Health, Amwell, and MDLive. The companyâ€™s focus on licensing its technology rather than direct patient care positions it uniquely in the market, especially as healthcare organizations seek to integrate virtual care solutions into their operations ([CB Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/98point6)).

### Financials and Growth Strategy
- **Funding**: The company has raised a total of $300 million in funding, indicating strong investor confidence in its technology and business model.
- **Growth Strategy**: The acquisition of Bright.md and the partnership with SteadyMD are part of a strategic push to enhance its product offerings and expand its market reach ([Healthcare Dive, January 2024](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/98point6-buys-bright-md-assets/704661/)).

### Key Personnel
- **Jay Burrell**, CEO of 98point6, emphasized the company's mission to empower healthcare providers with technology that broadens access and enhances patient engagement. He stated, "With the Bright.md acquisition, we are dramatically accelerating our efforts to offer a robust, multi-functional virtual care software platform" ([PR Newswire, January 2024](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html)).

### Opinions and Market Sentiment
The sentiment around 98point6 is mixed, particularly following the layoffs and strategic shifts. While the acquisition of Bright.md is seen as a positive step towards enhancing their product offerings, the layoffs raise concerns about the company's stability and future direction in a rapidly evolving market ([Pragmatic DLT, April 2024](https://pragmaticdlt.com/news/98point6-undergoes-significant-workforce-reduction-amid-business-model-transformation/)).

### Conclusion
98point6 Technologies is at a pivotal point in its evolution, transitioning from a direct care provider to a software licensing model. The recent acquisitions and partnerships indicate a commitment to growth and innovation in the virtual care space. However, the challenges posed by layoffs and market competition will require careful navigation to ensure long-term success. Prospective candidates and investors should consider both the potential for growth and the inherent risks associated with the company's current strategic direction.
