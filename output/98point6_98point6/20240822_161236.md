# About 98point6

98point6, founded on March 1, 2015, is a Seattle-based company specializing in digital healthcare services. Initially, the company operated as a virtual primary care provider but has since pivoted to focus on licensing its telehealth technology to healthcare providers. This strategic shift was marked by the sale of its virtual care and primary care operations to Transcarent for up to $100 million in 2023 ([Healthcare Dive, January 2024](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/98point6-buys-bright-md-assets/704661/)).

The company combines advanced technology with the expertise of board-certified physicians to provide text-based care anytime, anywhere. Their services are delivered through a mobile app, making healthcare accessible and convenient for users. 98point6 primarily operates on a B2B model, licensing its technology to healthcare providers, although it initially served consumers directly.

## Comprehensive Analyst Report on 98point6 Technologies and its Product

### Company Overview: 98point6 Technologies
98point6 Technologies, founded in 2015 and based in Seattle, is a leader in licensed on-demand virtual care software. The company initially operated as a virtual primary care provider but has pivoted to focus on licensing its telehealth technology to healthcare providers. This strategic shift was solidified by the sale of its virtual care and primary care operations to Transcarent for up to $100 million in 2023. The company has raised approximately $300 million in funding as of early 2023, with a significant funding round of $118 million in late 2020 ([Healthcare Dive, January 2024](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/98point6-buys-bright-md-assets/704661/)).

#### Key Personnel
- **Jay Burrell**: CEO of 98point6 Technologies, who stated, "Our mission at 98point6 is to build market-leading technology that empowers healthcare providers with the tools they need to broaden access, enhance patient engagement, and achieve cost savings through greater provider efficiency" ([PR Newswire, January 2024](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html)).
- **Brett Oliver, MD**: Chief Medical Information Officer at Baptist Health, who praised the partnership with 98point6, highlighting its potential to enhance patient offerings and operational efficiencies.

### Recent Developments
#### Acquisitions
- **Bright.md**: On January 16, 2024, 98point6 announced the acquisition of Bright.md's remaining assets, which will enhance its asynchronous care module. This acquisition is part of a broader strategy to expand its virtual care offerings and improve clinician and patient experiences ([PR Newswire, January 2024](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html)).

#### Partnerships
- **SteadyMD**: In October 2023, 98point6 formed a strategic partnership with SteadyMD to provide a comprehensive virtual care solution. This collaboration aims to help understaffed healthcare organizations lower costs, reduce clinician burnout, and manage patient workloads more effectively ([SteadyMD, October 2023](https://www.steadymd.com/blog/98point6-technologies-collaborates-with-steadymd-to-offer-comprehensive-virtual-care-solution-to-healthcare-organizations/)).

#### Layoffs and Business Model Transformation
- In April 2024, 98point6 underwent significant layoffs as part of its transformation towards a licensing model for its software solutions. This decision reflects the company's ongoing adjustments in response to market demands and financial pressures within the health tech sector ([Pragmatic DLT, April 2024](https://pragmaticdlt.com/news/98point6-undergoes-significant-workforce-reduction-amid-business-model-transformation/)).

### Product Overview: 98point6 Technology Platform
The flagship product of 98point6 is its cloud-based technology platform, which integrates artificial intelligence with automated practice standards and electronic health record (EHR) systems. The platform includes:
- **Clinician Console**: A physician-facing interface that streamlines patient visits and documentation.
- **Patient-Facing App**: A white-labeled application that allows patients to access care easily.
- **Asynchronous Care Module**: Newly developed to enable providers to communicate with patients at their convenience, enhancing flexibility and reducing clinician burnout ([PR Newswire, January 2024](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html)).

#### Market Position and User Base
98point6 has positioned itself as a key player in the virtual care market, serving millions of patients through its technology. The platform is designed to help healthcare organizations create and grow premium virtual care offerings, addressing the increasing demand for digital health solutions ([SteadyMD, October 2023](https://www.steadymd.com/blog/98point6-technologies-collaborates-with-steadymd-to-offer-comprehensive-virtual-care-solution-to-healthcare-organizations/)).

### Financial Overview
- **Funding**: 98point6 has raised approximately $300 million in total funding, with a notable round of $118 million in late 2020. The company is currently valued at around $2.2 billion following its acquisition by Transcarent ([MedCity News, May 2024](https://medcitynews.com/2024/05/glen-tullman-has-no-interest-in-selling-transcarent-but-ipo-is-a-possibility/)).
- **Revenue Model**: The company has shifted from direct patient care to a licensing model, which is expected to provide more stable and recurring revenue streams.

### Opinions and Market Sentiment
The sentiment around 98point6 is mixed, with some praising its innovative approach to virtual care while others express concerns about its recent layoffs and strategic pivots. The acquisition of Bright.md and partnership with SteadyMD are seen as positive steps towards enhancing its product offerings and market reach. However, the layoffs raise questions about the company's operational stability and employee morale ([Pragmatic DLT, April 2024](https://pragmaticdlt.com/news/98point6-undergoes-significant-workforce-reduction-amid-business-model-transformation/)).

### Conclusion
98point6 Technologies is navigating a transformative phase as it pivots towards a licensing model for its virtual care technology. The recent acquisition of Bright.md and partnership with SteadyMD position the company for growth in the evolving healthcare landscape. However, the impact of layoffs and strategic shifts on its workforce and service delivery remains a critical area to watch for prospective candidates and investors. The company's commitment to enhancing patient and clinician experiences through innovative technology continues to be a focal point of its mission.
