# Apple App Store Reviews
## PLEASE fix your latency, 2 stars (Samsaranc, Apple App Store, 2023-01-30)
For what it is, the app is pretty feature-rich and the UI/UX is intuitive. If there were no latency issues, I’d give it 4 stars. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

HOWEVER, the latency to do anything at all on iOS is pretty much unbearable. Compared to literally every other (internet-connected) app I use, Quenza is the WORST. 
It saddens me that my provider only uses this app and to continue receiving care I have to use it. 
From one production software engineer to another: PLEASE fix the latency issues. They are ruining your relatively good app. Just bc of the latency, I am tempted to leave a single star rating ⭐️ but I also don’t want to be a jerk, so you’re getting 2.

## Fine, could be better, 3 stars (ximacloudx, Apple App Store, 2022-09-06)
Talking purely about the app as an app: 
1. The login screen is a little slow to pop up and slow to process 
2. On a phone it’s hard to scroll through the response boxes to see what you’ve already written/edited. Makes it less fun to use on the phone 
3. You can’t sort what you want badges for - so if you’re on a pathway, it’s impossible to not have badges if your curriculum is supposed to extend for months. Ideally I’d want to pick whether I want activities/chats/pathways to add to the badge count (I’d also want to separate them for push notification purposes)

## Can’t access, 1 stars (kcgbosslady, Apple App Store, 2021-11-03)
Can’t get past the pin screen don’t know exactly what we get with this product.

## Can’t get past PIN screen!,, 1 stars (slyandgracie, Apple App Store, 2021-09-19)
The keypad isn’t “triggered” to appear on the PIN screen, so a PIN cannot be entered!  And yet it says a PIN is “required” and will not advance past that page.  Have tried on both an ipad and an Amazon Fire tablet.  Will try later on a PC, but this is unacceptable.  😤
# Google Play Store Reviews
## 3 stars (Kasia Walczak, Google Play Store, 2023-01-08)
Great app but many (too many) times there are streaming errors, " failed to play audio file" or "lost connection"....

## 5 stars (Jamie Arias, Google Play Store, 2022-07-04)
Quenza is an incredible app for therapist, and coaches building a practice.

## 5 stars (Coach Cassy Farmer, Google Play Store, 2022-06-24)
Love it! Helps me to keep my business organized!

## 5 stars (Vaughn Guenter, Google Play Store, 2022-06-03)
A brilliantly designed platform that is user-friendly for both practitioners and their clients.

## 3 stars (Life Coach Maryke, Google Play Store, 2022-05-27)
Please help. When I download the app, there is no option to sign up. Only to sign in...

## 1 stars (Udhayaraj .G, Google Play Store, 2021-12-30)
Hello Quenza. Why you are not allowing users to create account in your app. I downloaded your app and opened its asking to login your account where will I go account ?

## 1 stars (Lucy Oberg, Google Play Store, 2021-12-05)
Cant set up email or password

## 4 stars (Rambito, Google Play Store, 2021-08-18)
Is it in spanish too?
