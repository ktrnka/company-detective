<h1>Apple App Store Reviews</h1>
<h2>Premium account, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11660957537">(movie watcher1o1, Apple App Store, 2024-08-27)</a></h2>
<p>I paid $153 a month ago for the premium account. However, whenever I login and reset my password, it still says I have a free account. </p>
<p>I’ve deleted the free account and the app then reinstated both. Still no premium account. </p>
<p>Frustrated! How do I get the premium version installed on all my devices?</p>
<h2>Not working, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11659709530">(Zymyria, Apple App Store, 2024-08-27)</a></h2>
<p>The app is not working properly. It keeps asking me to do things that's already done</p>
<h2>Used the be great!, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11659471883">(Zephyr274, Apple App Store, 2024-08-27)</a></h2>
<p>The so-called smart correct and suggestions are awful. Your implementation of using AI has changed the functionality of this app, as well as your program; when used on the computer, I miss the old Grammarly. .now I have to constantly rewrite sentences because you have decided that something else had to be said or a different phrase or a different wording, and I had nothing to do with what I was writing; rehire your staff people back in place over technology stop using AI know you love capitalism more than helping that’s become abundantly clear. Update July 2024- How is it possible for this app to get worse?!!!! It's making suggestions and then leaving spaces, removing periods, and adding letters all over the place. Please stop making my sentences incompleteand marking everything good! (no Grammarly I don't want the word mark!!!) Or my new favorite, suggesting passive voice and then telling me to correct it. AI is ruining everyhh Jn vg Perfect example! That wasn't what I was writing but that is what was suggested and now it wants to fix it after making it worse! Ugh!!! This is messing up my business and becoming the biggest waste of money. Update Aug 2024 - yup getting worse! Now adding duplicate words all on its own and then the stupid app says it’s perfect. Wrote to support but that has never been helpful. I am a long time customer watching AI burn this app to the ground. Unless repaired over the next several months I will not be renewing this service.
Update end of Aug: I don’t do free product support and identifying bug requests. You should have an entire team of humans to work on that, not free labor of your customers or AI. Your app does the problems mentioned above and what I sent support EVERYWHERE, the biggest problem is in your own app, notes, word, and any browser.</p>

<h2>Review for “Reputable Grammarly.”, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11656278829">(Serenetides, Apple App Store, 2024-08-26)</a></h2>
<p>After purchasing Grammarly years ago, I have improved tens of thousands of sentences. Besides improving my spelling, Grammarly taught me how to simplify my sentences, improve my formalities in letter writing, and improve on my e-mail etiquette. Finally, the plagiarism feature gives me peace of mind. The thorough program continuously adds websites to check my works in progress against unintentional copyright infringement. In my humble opinion, I believe every writer should use Grammarly, for improvements, and versatile applications.</p>

<h2>Review Decent But With Improvements Would Be Amazing App, 3 stars <a href="https://apple/11651660722">(Alexc1540, Apple App Store, 2024-08-25)</a></h2>
<p>The app is generally good, but the keyboard is slow to respond and sometimes auto-fills with the wrong word. Additionally, the "improve my text" feature doesn't work properly due to sensitivity to certain words, even when not writing anything inappropriate. It's also difficult to insert text directly; you have to copy and paste, which is frustrating. Furthermore, the lack of a speech-to-text button makes it challenging to send messages when your hands are occupied or you're short on time. If these issues were fixed, it would be a great app.</p>

<p>I began to recognize that I had some word loss at age 67. Unsure of the severity but, knowing something was missing in my writing. Now, I have Grammarly. I love to write. 
 As a former educator, l was embarrassed when someone I love told me, “It has become difficult to understand my writing. You should be ashamed to call yourself an educator”.  The person next to him suggested using Grammarly.
  It can help. Thanks to the Grammarly app  I am writing again. More expressive than I have been in a long time. The old American colloquialism,” It ain't over till the fat lady sings “. Thanks to, Grammarly, the fat lady is singing again.</p>

Also, I pay 60 dollars to use the service, and it won't let me use certain ideas or thoughts, as it goes against guidelines regarding sensitive information. Why Am I paying for a service that tells me what I can say or not say? </p>
<p>I'm not using any threatening wording.</p>

<p>The Grammarly keyboard keeps changing the words as I type to wrong words or incorrect spellings, then tells me to fix them later. Doesn't make sense at all.</p>

<h2>Leftist ideology run amok!, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11642005554">(Nwfoxflyer, Apple App Store, 2024-08-22)</a></h2>
<p>This app hates conservative talking points and will do everything it can to make inappropriate suggestions whenever I am replying to a lefty Marxist. Also, this app screws up your iPhone keyboard. It makes the iPhone keyboard act spastic whenever you hold down the space button to move the cursor. The only way to edit is to turn Grammarly off, make your edits, then turn it back on. Kind of defeats the whole purpose.</p>

<p>Grammarly does its job perfectly up to the point where I want to know what I did wrong after it corrects me 3 times. I am NOT going to pay for something that does minor changes to what I've written. There could be more that I haven't found but so far it is only a little helpful while I'm writing and not when I need to review after I am done writing.</p>

Also the sentence instead of asking user to revise past tense present tense it should do the work. If the user know how to fix all this they won’t be using your service</p>

<h2>Politically subversive App, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11623891102">(Short2003, Apple App Store, 2024-08-18)</a></h2>
<p>I purchased Grammarly years ago, at least 6 years ago or more, over time Grammarly has become political. The software refused to editba comment I had written because the comment was about a conservative political position. Who owns the software operating in my machines’ RAM me or Grammarly? What right does Grammarly have to refuse to correct the grammar of a ‘particular comment’? That is MARXIST FASCISM. I am uninstalling Grammarly today. I guarantee that unearned licensing fee income I paid will be retained with my subscription expiring whenever it was supposed to expire. I find that they can keep my money because of some vague legalese verbiage in the ‘100 something’ pages of the Terms of Use Agreement. Buh, bye Felicia- bless your black heart. Anyone else experiencing the censorship through refusal to edit? Raise Hades about it, this is the insidious creep of Fascism in real time.

<p>why is the correcting box (floating widget) covering what we are typing, I don't see what im typing and is bad.. when I see the change, I give back 5 ⭐, if the correcting box still covers the text for longtime, then I will uninstall the App.✌️</p>

<p>I enjoy Grammarly, but... I would appreciate the ability to block certain apps myself, and when I turn it off, that it stays off until I turn it back on. The biggest issue right now is that it will turn itself back on while I'm using Discord, an app I don't want to use Grammarly in. Please fix the issue where it turns itself back on, and please give us the ability to block apps we don't want to use it in. Otherwise, spectacular app that I very much appreciate using for work and other uses.</p>

<p>The Android app is at times, unlike the desktop program, a little clunky. Specifically, the popup will tell me that there is a sentence that could be better, but when I tap on the suggestions button, it just bounces and doesn't show me the suggestion. I've tried swiping the suggestion bar up, double tapping, rotating the screen (which did work, once), but I can't see the suggestions. Making it simpler to open the suggestions bar would make this 5 stars for me. (Galaxy Tab S9+ w/keyboard)</p>

<p>A very useful app that has protocols in place that prevent the user from writing misleading content, not based on facts or sufficient data to evince postulations that would be considered conjecture. I consider this a great program for this reason and highly recommend this for those who experience difficulties in writing or expressing views. Forget about expressing opinionated content because Grammarly will not allow or make adjustments for erroneous content. 5 stars for this reason!</p>

<p>Pretty good overall. Grammarly helps me write by setting different tones and writing styles, making my work quicker. However, the app only works 3 out of 5 times. The "suggestion bundles" that help you improve sentences often disappears, forcing me to close my writing app to reset Grammarly. Very annoying. The suggestions are also for the entire page, not just a sentence or two, and the "improve it" button doesn't work at all. If these features were fixed, then I'd be happy to give it 5 stars.</p>
