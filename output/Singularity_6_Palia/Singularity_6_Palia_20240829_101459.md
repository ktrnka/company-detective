## Sentiment on Palia

### Negative Sentiment
- "Palia felt restrictive. If the goal was to move away entirely from pvp and combat more generally... you had to have had more freedom for players to build solo, build together to make a village, a town, a city." [generalmasandra, Reddit, 2024-04-08](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1bz2e0z/palia_developers_singularity_6_axes_35_of_staff/kyn4d7g/)

## Thumbs Up [(Steam, 2024-07-28)](https://steam/76561198141541947)
I have enjoyed this game so much more than I thought. It's nice to play a game that is kind of like Minecraft meets Animal Crossing. I love that I don't have enemies to fight, no one can hurt/hunt me, there is no fall damage, crops don't die if you can't water them right away, and that, so far, everyone has been very helpful and friendly. It's nice to have a pleasant world to escape too. The only downfall....I've done almost all the quests and waiting for more. I'm working to upgrade my skills for now.

## Thumbs Down [(Steam, 2024-08-01)](https://steam/76561198006596790)
This game is basically Stardew Valley if it was 3D and had a quarter of the content. You set up your farm with crops and  crafting benches, make friends with the villagers, complete quests, gather and give gifts, complete weekly tasks and hoard a lot of stuff. The villagers are very likeable with a personality for each type of player, and you can romance every romance option at the same time. The latest patch (at the time of writing this) also added a system where you can show off your farm plots to other players to recieve rewards, for those people who love to build stuff and prance their creations around.

However, the game also has plenty of problems.
- There are only two areas to explore, three if you count your farm. Nothing has been added in a year.
- There are only three types of ore and three types of wood. The highest tier of both is a rare resource that has to be farmed.
- There are no farm animals. You get a couple of crops and you better be happy with it.
- The cash shop is very expensive and seems to be the biggest focus in every update, especially after Daybreak Games bought Singularity 6.
- There are lots of bugs and every update breaks something else. Animals glitching into rocks and trees, loot bags getting stuck in unreachable areas, aquariums turning into dark squares, planted trees that stop growing, paths and furniture moving on its own, the list goes on.

My recommendation: play it for the quests and villager interactions and then drop it. The game drops down hard once you run out of those things, and since 75% of Singularity 6's staff was let go after the acquisition, i wouldn't expect any banger content to be added any time soon.

## Thumbs Down [(Steam, 2024-08-18)](https://steam/76561198097454604)
I'd love to play this game but I can't. The seizure warning is buried in the screens you get after making an account and after logging in, after the news/updates page. Only then is there a seizure warning and you can't even exit the game after seeing the warning. I had to dismiss the warning, thinking there would be an option to exit on the next screen. But it just goes directly into a bright pulsating light for the character creation menu. At least give me the option to bail at the warning! Be upfront about the warning!

## Thumbs Up [(Steam, 2024-07-31)](https://steam/76561198862507504)
Free game, not much to expect. It's a pretty straight forward game that includes slice of life aspects but the main issue with it is you have to walk EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Thumbs Up [(Steam, 2024-08-12)](https://steam/76561198188053049)
Just a wonderful non-stressful game. Enough quests to keep you going, while offering you the opportunity to increase your skills with fishing, hunting, mining, building and so on. So many hours of stress free fun.

## Thumbs Up [(Steam, 2024-07-31)](https://steam/76561198302866288)
palia more like GRINDIA AMIRITE

Fun game tho, only cosmetics are paid as well, which is a plus (I paid like 30 bucks to be a shiny fairy and I'm not ashamed of it)

## Thumbs Down [(Steam, 2024-08-02)](https://steam/76561199133670472)
i couldn't even get to the actual game because of how buggy the interface was and the buttons either had the hit box miles away in a random spot or crashed the game. It even froze up my computer and I had to restart it. Until these things are fixed I really cannot recommend this game

## Thumbs Down [(Steam, 2024-08-12)](https://steam/76561198287231874)
Just a buggy, boring game with no endgame whatsoever trying to masquerade as a "cozy" mmo. What??? There's absolutely nothing cozy about this game, and there's barely any actual multiplayer. Also 30$ usd for 1 player skin is crazy.

## Thumbs Up [(Steam, 2024-08-10)](https://steam/76561198063036000)
Super cozy! I have enjoyed several hours in this game and I am ready to spend several more.
It has all the things I enjoy in regular MMOs such as gathering, crafting, building up my own space, etc. I am also just a sucker for any game that has fishing >.> and these folks deliver on the fishing. Use bait. Don't use bait. Get better fishing rods. Get all the achievements! Then they make it even better by, and this goes for anything you're doing in the game, giving you bonuses if you do the activity with others. This is legitimately one of the best and most helpful communities I have seen in a game.

## Thumbs Down [(Steam, 2024-08-09)](https://steam/76561198306860762)
Too bad...

friends hyped me up to install and play this game.
I started character creation and realized I didn't have any game sound - so selecting a character voice was impossible.
Tried to back out into the main screen - it wouldn't let me.
Ended up giving the character a random letter name (like hahjfkef) just to get out of character creation and back to settings to fix my audio... turns out YOU CAN'T DELETE THE CHARACTER or make a new one. No option to re-name or re-configure. Just no options at all.
Guess I won't be playing this, then, until they fix this most basic feature...

## Thumbs Up [(Steam, 2024-08-19)](https://steam/76561199037913524)
i really like palia :3 
i think its a good game for winding down, and i really like how its not based on real time events or whatever. you can do everything at your own pace!! 
the character designs are really great, the world itself is super pretty, and i really love most of the mechanics for farming/cooking/etc
super chill and super cozy ^_^

## Thumbs Down [(Steam, 2024-08-11)](https://steam/76561198129307002)
I really wanted to like Palia, but I couldn't stay excited about it past release. The lack of animated cutscenes makes all the stories feel empty and dull - for a game with otherwise nice character animation and environments, it feels strange to not actually see events *happen*, rather than just being told about them. Am I in this world or am I not? Is it a book or a 3D environment? 
There are gameplay aspects that are... fun enough, out of context. They're okay. It's not fun enough to farm or hunt in Palia to log on just for that, which is the problem. The gameplay doesn't hold up alone; the story without cutscenes doesn't hold up alone; the character design and home customisation don't hold up alone; everything is lacking in specific ways that just don't make it very exciting to play. 

It's an okay game on many fronts but not a great game on any. Honestly, its strongest point are the character animations, but they feel meaningless without a more exciting storyline with animated cutscenes. The writing isn't bad, but it feels wasted on these disconnected visual novel dialogues. If the devs focused on telling the story with exciting cutscenes, that could be the thing that made Palia stand out. 

For a game that put a lot of emphasis on being a wholesome social place to hang out and make friends, the chat system and the server system don't feel inviting at all. I can't be bothered to talk to people beyond bare minimum (for materials), because the chat isn't well designed. 

I have zero interest in paying 30 bucks for some cosmetic items if there isn't enough effort put into making the game more fun to play and the story more engaging to parttake in with animated cutscenes. AND, on top of that, the character customisation is not very good. It's just okay. What are you really paying for? A mid outfit for a mid character for a mid game. If things don't change, I don't recommend anyone to spend that money on this game, when you could be getting things of higher quality and more fun by spending it on other games. 

Again, I really wanted to like the game. And I hope if the devs read reviews, that they can listen and take to heart the issues with Palia that hold it back. You have to question "is this fun?" when you're making a game and when you're designing the way the story is being told. Palia has some good bases to build on, the gameplay has parts that are kinda fun, the character animations are nice, it's just not quite enough. So far, Palia isn't more than a good base for a game.

Friendly beautiful, chill out game!
Including quests, riddles, crafting, farming, fishing, cooking, achieving, collecting! 

Use climb rocks and walls mechanics or planer (like an avatar Aaangh) to reach some hidden places or just fly over quick from hills n stuff.

You can ask some items you need and send gifts to share someone if you see some requests in special tab.

First time, i learned the basics and start doing quests and getting some stuff for myself =^-^=
Solve riddles in ancient locations using climbing and planer make me feel like i play uncharted or lara croft series (but without agressive fights and actions).
I discovered a real jump-quest challenge and was surprised a lot, completely stuck in game for quests, and make a break every game night to play some special games with other players in some "Illegal place" :D

You have to improve your reputation with npc villagers, by speaking and helping them, making a gifts. Also you can romance some of them! 
Dialogue desicions choosing your element type personality (fire, wind, water or earth) avatar stuff again :D 
Peaceful music ambience.
Game recomended for family gaming its pretty good!

Palia requires registration account at own site, steam get connected with it, and you can link up twitch for twitch drops rewards by viewing devs or partner streamers gameplay!

If you start with friends or family, there is referal code link you can share to get additional costume and stuff. 
5 friends joined require for all rewards, each of them have a nice fruits decoration for house.

Join my link for helping me achieve this stuff, and share yours when you get started!

quality game, constant updates coming out with new content and a really solid community. I have yet to meet a toxic player or even someone unwilling to help. If you're looking for a relaxing game you can play with a partner/friend or a game you can play while having a show on the second monitor. This is truly it.

Can't change character names or altogether delete characters and would need to make a new account. Your "full name" is what people see instead of your nickname. it's a pain in the butt to sign up and link accounts. Already dealt with bugs at the beginning of the game, with weird solid walls and cut off speech with the NPCs. Not all of it looks/is bad, but its not worth the hassle.

This rocks! This is just like Stardew Valley and Sun Haven. You mine, fish, farm, cook, build your house and furniture, romance characters, do quests,  kill creatures, harvest plants and cut trees. You can be in a poly relationship. I'm not sure if you can marry anyone but they can be your lover. You can play with your friends like WoW. There isn't any fighting over resources when you play with your friends because even if you are working on the same tree, rock, quests, or plant, everyone receives the same resources. You can fast travel from anywhere in Palia to your home lot. You can have gliders to fly, pets, and outfits that are just for show. Fishing is a lot easier then in Stawdew Valley or Sun Haven. 

It's just a really fun game. I spent 6 hours playing for the first time in one go. Great Job making it!

the premise is nice, so is the design but I'm not sure if its just my PC or if its actually the game but first night I was able play it fine, 3rd day attempting it has provided nothing but issues. The mouse cursor doesn't line up, had graphics problems, once it even made my computer crash. I'm sure if I could get it to work I would love it but at the current state it's in it is not playable. only plus side is that it was free.

I mean, it's not bad. The only thing I really don't understand is the "multiplayer." You come across a few people that are doing their own thing. You can't interact with them outside of typing in chat which is rarely used unless you go outside of the main map. If you stayed in the main map, you would think they were bots. From what I've seen, the only thing you can actually do with other people is hunt, collect and fish together. It doesn't look like you can do much of the "co-op" experience. Everyone I've come across and spoken to has been very friendly. But yeah, if you expected a co-op experience where you could do everything with your friend, this is not it. 

I do wish that the UI when it comes to friendships was a little more simplified. It's extremely annoying to have to click on every character in my friendship tab to remember what it was they wanted. A list of all the wants besides the characters name would be great. It's unbelievably annoying that if you gift someone something before you ask them what they want, you now have to wait an entire real life day to give them what they said they wanted. IMO, the method Stardew Valley uses of the two gifts per week + whatever they say they want/need would be much better here. 

If you wanted a game where you didn't have to think all too hard and plan things out, this is for you.

I really enjoy this game. Perfect for my cozy gamers who enjoy adventure, crafting, and farming.

I was looking for a new farming sim type game to play, and noticed this one is free to play! I am telling you, you get SO much fun just playing. The only time you spend money (if you so choose) is on cosmetic things like outfits, tool skins, pets, etc. The game itself is fun and relaxing, and I would recommend you give it a try!

After putting in over 30 hours myself, and my girlfriend has put in about 90 hours, I can confidently say this game was made for us!
Over the years we have played many games of this genre and have always had things we wished were done better, but we both really feel everything about this game is just perfect for us.  I highly recommend for anyone interested in games like Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, My Time at Portia/Sandrock, Disney Dreamlight Valley, Coral Island, Hokko Life, Palworld, Cozy Grove, Yonder, Story of Seasons. While all these games are different in their own way, we feel Palia just takes the best of them all and puts it together perfectly in a Massively Multiplayer Online social format similar to that of games like World of Warcraft (without combat). I cannot recommend this one enough!!

Great game and awesome community. Such an awesome set of players. The game is a lot of fun. The scenery is visually appealing. I love all the items you can pick up. Hunting is great. The respawn rate makes it so everyone has fun. The community is key with this game, and that also makes it worth playing.

My issues are the game crashes a lot. My character also freezes a lot, and I get stuck in scenery in a way that requires me to restart. The temples were excruciating to complete because of the amount of time I was restarting and traveling back to said location. My PC meets all the recommended requirements, and I understand there are a series of fixes to make the game work better. I've put in a lot of hours and tolerated much. I would like to play this game without the headache.

I have ADHD and this game lets that run wild with a lot of things to gather and craft.  This is not a challenging game and I enjoy the stress free time.  I do think the pricing for outfits is too high for a game in Beta.  I hope there are some options for character outfits that we can unlock or earn as well.

This is like The Sims decided to take a vacation in a fantasy land and brought Pinterest along for the ride. It’s a game where you can farm, fish, and frolic with more enthusiasm than a Labrador at a ball pit. This cozy MMO is packed with so much charm, it could probably power a small village.

Character customization? Let’s just say you’ll spend more time perfecting your avatar’s look than you do deciding what to wear in real life (if you havethe money for it). The housing system is a decorator's dream – it’s like HGTV on magical steroids. Want a house by the enchanted forest? Done. Fancy a beachside villa? Absolutely, why not?

Gameplay in "Palia" is as relaxing as a hammock on a summer day. The quests are less about saving the world and more about enjoying your whimsical, low-stress life. It's basically a never-ending vacation where the biggest challenge is deciding whether to plant pumpkins or carrots.

It is a delightful escape from reality where you can live out your fantasy of being a farmer-fisher-decorator-adventurer all at once. It’s the perfect game for anyone who’s ever wished they could live inside a charming storybook – complete with fairy lights and an endless supply of cute outfits. If you need a break from reality, Palia is the ultimate feel-good fantasy retreat that you'll never want to leave.

This is one of the best free games I've played. There is so much to do in just the two zones. So many NPCs with a ton of fun quests that make sure you're never waiting for something to craft, you can always go out and catch bugs or fish to sell and make some extra money. Love it.

I was gifted this game by my son because I saw it while scrolling through all the games on Steam and thought the graphics were great. I LOVE the beautiful graphics and the challenge of figuring out how to play without a lot of game guides next to me. What I haven't enjoyed is my computer crashing on me because my graphics card isn't hefty enough to handle this game. It's a good thing I'm not a serious gamer. I'm able to tone down my details and still have stunning gameplay. Maybe make this more normal person PC friendly? Otherwise, I'm happy to play for hours!! The kid in me woke up! :)

Beat game I've played in a very long time. It's very addicting. If you enjoy decorating this is the game for you. or if you just enjoy wandering around hunting, fishing, mining or foraging. It's got a lot of characters to get to know to unlock quests.  It's just a really relaxing game. Love it.

Practically a free Dreamlight Valley, dope map design, Customization could use a lil more options in clothing tops as well as the hairstyles and pants/bottoms but I am happy with what's there =) relaxing gameplay, fun multiplayer aspect. Because I did have a few gltiches such as trying to enter town from my farm and not being able to, and then the sky texture kinda blurred my screen once everytime I walked through a spot on my farm. ( The sky did resolve it's own issue somehow at one point lol) I enjoyed this a lot. 7/10

EDIT:

Okay, so I've become addicted to this game, BUT I still am marking it as not recommended.

If I could mark it as neutral, I would.

If you are looking for a farming MMO, this is not it. It's not like you're able to walk around a neighborhood and say hi to your neighbors. Sadly, a game doesn't exist like that yet. 

If you are DESPERATE for a pet + outfits, there is a cheap $8.50 bundle that has 4 outfits (with color palette swaps) + getting a brown cat for your first premium money purchase. That's as of writing this review. That might change in the future.

As for the slow animations I mentioned before, yes they are still slow, but when you get tool upgrades, your chores go by much much quicker. Also, look up garden layouts for maximum water retention so you don't have to water your crops every damn hour (YES, EVERY IRL HOUR).

So, why am I addicted to this game? I refuse to spend anymore money on it beyond taht $8.50 bundle because this whole game could shut down within the next year, and it's honestly stilll a buggy mess.

to be honest, it just gives that nice dopamine hit when you wanna chill and do no brain stuff like mining for ore, cutting down trees, crafting furniture, shoot deer and red pandas, etc. Maybe it's my ADHD and autism that makes it satisfying.

Story still isn't engaging. Writing still sucks in my opinion. Some of the main story quests and bugged to hell and back and haven't been fixed since they got released. 

Making money does get easier once you hit your stride but yes, the beginning is really damn slow.

The community has been really nice IMO. The "unspoken" rules are easy to understand and they aren't a pain. 

People are willing to help you understand. Just gotta ask.

Basically, call out rare resources like palium, flow trees, magical hunting targets, rare forage materials, etc with the map coordinates, and flare if you can with everything except the hunting targets.

Oh yeah, another big downside.

This damn game takes 33gb if you use their client. On steam, I think it takes around 20. To give you an idea of how unnecessary big and and unoptimized this game is...

Final Fantasy 14 Online, with all the expansions including Dawntrail....takes only 90GB on your hard drive. 

Unfortunately, it looks like optimization and bug fixes are not a priority for the devs at this point.

If you can't handle that, don't bother playing the game. As much as I like this game, once stuff starts filling up on my second hard drive, this game is on the chopping block of getting uninstalled. Which is another reason why I refuse to spend more than $8.50.

I think some people were complaining about cliques, but I don't find the game cliquey at all. Again, people are always willing to help out. 


Original review:

Played it on their app instead of steam. I tried to enjoy it. I played it for a good 10 hours. It's not worth it. The premium shop prices are egregious. Upwards of $30-60 for an outfit that just comes with palette swaps??? "It's optional!" I don't care if it's optional. They should not be charging that much money for outfits. Especially if you want your character to look nice, have a pet, etc. All the good looking cosmetics are locked behind high prices when if you're f2p, you're locked into the basic look. 

It's so boring too. Everything, I MEAN EVERYTHING, is slow. I know it's supposed to be relaxing, but this isn't it. Other farming sims have quick animations and are still relaxing. 

I wanted to try Palia gain because I enjoy decoration. Forget that. Earning money is an awful grind. Unfortunately, a lot of the problems are fundamental stuff. 

And even worse, the world is just....empty. Ruins? Sure. Small little village? Yeah. But it's a bunch of open field with NOTHING! Apparently this is some sort of post apocalyptic world? I've never found that a good excuse though.

Oh and the characters. Forget it. The are cringey as all hell and forgettable. "Wait until you get to know them more!" No. Good writing is supposed to hook you and make you care about the story and character pretty damn quick. Otherwise, why else am I putting up with this gameplay???

Oh and even funnier. It won't let me uninstall the damn thing without a workaround when it comes to using their client. If you are gonna try the game, do it through Steam. There's more I wanna say, but I just am baffled.

Would really love to actually play this game but either the game itself crashes or it crashes my pc. I can't even get to the main menu before a crash occurs. I've updated all my drivers and pc itself. This is all with a 14th gen i9, 32gb RAM, and an RTX 4070 super. Again, I really want to play this game, I've only ever seen and heard good things about it, but I can barely even get it to boot.

there is a tldr at the bottom of this review since it is a bit lengthy.
i don't usually leave reviews but i was so taken aback by just how poor several key aspects of this game are i feel compelled. you should take any money you might have spent on this game's insanely overpriced cosmetics and find yourself something else. you could buy a full, better game for the price of one outfit in palia. there are plenty of games that do well what palia is attempting and failing to do. it is hard to believe this game had a $50 mil budget and the devs are industry veterans.
this studio has gone through massive layoffs a few times and an acquisition recently so this game may not have much time left anyway. reading reviews from people who have been playing since alpha, the devs are also known to be actively hostile toward players and have been on more than one occasion on blog posts and on discord, including threatening to make the game worse on purpose, that's always a good sign.

it should also be noted i absolutely do not hate this game for being "woke" and i, as someone who would be considered "woke" through my sheer existence, actually have no idea what so many simpletons in the reviews are referring to as "woke" unless they mean the fact that... you can play as a black person? there are women in the game? i seriously have no clue. if you are going into a game expecting every single character to be a macho white man and the fact that other people exist offends your delicate snowflake sensibilities, then that is your own fault for being immature and unable to cope with reality, and you would also benefit from therapy. trust me, you'd feel a lot better after getting help. if you think this game is "woke" i have no idea how you can even leave your house without having a meltdown. anyway, let's get started.

i tried this out for a few hours and it was okay gameplay-wise, but there are too many issues to make it worth putting more time into. the world is quite small (there are TWO areas, your house and the village) and visually it is not very interesting. it is your standard generic fantasy village. the art style and design for the player character is generic too. there's not much to do or work toward in the game because of poor choices i discuss later. it's basically just grind grind grind grind grind and wait wait wait wait.
you can chop down trees, break rocks, pick up stuff you find on the ground, garden a very small variety of crops in a very small garden, fish or catch bugs, craft items to decorate your house, do quests (note there is no combat in this game, so all quests are fetch quests), romance the characters by giving them items, and stand around and wait for time to pass. apparently there is a minigame you can play with other players, but in my time i barely saw anyone else. you'll be waiting in line on load screens to access almost empty or totally empty servers.
what there is available to do is pretty chill provided you like grinding because that's literally all there is to do in this game, and it might be fun to play with friends to get more mileage out of the limited amount of features, but on your own (and factoring in the game's other huge shortcomings which i am about to go into) it gets old fast. especially if you have played pretty much any other game of this genre. the amount of highly positive reviews for palia really surprises me since there are so many significantly more robust similar games out there.

the biggest issue, however, is the character creator leaves A LOT to be desired, the cosmetics are hideously overpriced ($25+ on the LOW end of things), and there are literally zero free cosmetics or pets in the game outside of the default clothing in the character creator.

the diversity in body types, facial features, etc seen in NPCs in the game puts the character creator to shame. there is one female and one male body type and both of them are thin. there are no sliders of any kind. you cannot remove the exaggerated eyelashes from the female player character. you cannot mix and match facial features and face shapes. face shapes and features are gender locked. i'm basically playing as some generic fortnite looking ass dude. it is absolutely one of the worst character creators i have ever encountered in a modern game. i think i would have genuinely preferred being given no character creation options whatsoever.
i figured, well, at least i will be able to customize myself in other ways once i get started, such as cute cosmetics. i was wrong! as i mentioned, you CANNOT obtain any cosmetics! you only get the boring default ones in the character creator. ALL cosmetic items such as clothes and weapon skins are purchased with real money, and they are egregiously expensive. you have to pay for each individual clothing color scheme as well. pets are also purchased with real money.
i guess they have to be expensive because there is no other monetization and therefore no other way for them to make money. seems like a recipe for disaster in the first place, not that i enjoy having to pay for things, but this isn't tf2 or fortnite where you have a reason to play other than cosmetics, this is a game in a genre that is known for character customization as one of the key pillars of gameplay, and this strips the gameplay aspect from it entirely. i am not willing to shell out $20+ on a SINGLE ITEM of virtual clothing in a game that might not even last the rest of the year considering what's been going on with the studio, especially since it has such poor character customization to begin with. i described the player as a fortnite looking ass dude due to how generic the art style and design is, and it seems to take after fortnite in the expensive cosmetics department as well; although the cosmetics prices in palia generally cost even more than fortnite cosmetics! just because fortnite does it, doesn't mean you should!
i exited and uninstalled palia due to my extreme disappointment the moment i figured this out. character customization is one of the single most important elements of video games like this. as i said, it is typically one of the pillars of gameplay in this genre, and one of many different things to work toward in games that are better than palia. without it, the game is severely lacking in things that feel worth striving toward, and i feel no connection to the player character or world. i am truly baffled that it is such an afterthought in a game that's supposed to be cozy, where you can build and decorate a house and even romance the characters. if you cannot immerse yourself in the world, why even bother?
they seem to think that plushie collecting is enough to make up for the fact that you can only look nice if you want to spend egregious amounts of money... and it's just not...

tldr: imo there is not much incentive to spend time in the world of palia if you don't want to open your wallet. the gameplay is just grinding or waiting around, and ALL cosmetic items and pets are paid for with real money and are expensive. you could buy a full, better game for the price of one outfit. there are no cosmetics outside of the character creator, which itself is one of the worst character creators i have ever seen. the lack of cosmetics and pets is a huge blow to the game. without them there is not much to work toward. there are also not many other players. you have to wait in line on load screens to enter empty or almost empty servers.
if you want to play anyway, be wary about spending real money, as the studio behind it is going through rough times (multiple rounds of massive layoffs and being purchased by another company followed by even more layoffs) and it is quite possible this game will be abandoned or even shuttered in the near future. the devs have also lashed out against the playerbase in blog posts and on discord multiple times. 

who knows. with any luck, maybe this will turn into something better at some point in its future, if it has one.

This game has a few glitches because it is in Beta. But in all the art work is beautifully done, each character (including your own),  has a very unique yet relatable story line! This is not your typical cozy farming sim! Highly suggest trying this FREE game! Also available on Nintendo Switch, but the graphics are WAY better on the computer!

Palia is a community simulation game that offers players a cozy and engaging experience in a vibrant world. Marketed as a social MMO, it emphasizes crafting, building, and community interactions. While the game has a charming atmosphere and a variety of activities, it also faces some challenges and limitations.

The gameplay allows players to engage in activities like gathering, crafting, and building. The customization options, especially for home plots, offer a personal touch and can be satisfying. However, the game is not without issues; technical problems, such as items freezing in place or becoming untouchable, can disrupt the gameplay experience.

Despite being designed as a social MMO, Palia often feels more solitary than intended. Many players tend to focus on individual tasks rather than engaging in community interactions, making the world feel less connected and lively.

The game initially offers a variety of tasks and quests, but it quickly becomes repetitive. Once players complete the available content, they find themselves waiting for updates to continue progressing. The skills system provides medals as rewards for upgrades, which can be traded for items. However, the selection is limited, and once players have fully customized their home plots, there is little left to do.

While Palia features a range of NPCs, their dialogue becomes repetitive over time, reducing the sense of immersion and making the interactions feel stale.

Palia features cosmetic microtransactions, with items purchasable using "Palia Coins." Prices range from $4.99 for 425 coins to $99.99 for 11,050 coins, with higher tiers offering bonus coins. These purchases are purely cosmetic and do not impact gameplay. However, the selection, especially for male characters, is limited. This can be disappointing for players looking for more customization options. Some players may find themselves spending significant amounts— I've spent upwards of $150.

An easy way to earn gold coins in the game is through cake/cooking parties. However, these sessions can become monotonous, requiring long periods of repetitive button and mouse clicking, which can detract from the overall enjoyment.

Palia lays the groundwork for a charming and engaging community simulation game but is held back by technical issues, repetitive content, and limited social interactions. The game may appeal to players looking for a relaxing, casual experience, but it could benefit from more content, expanded customization options, and improved social features to maintain long-term interest.

Initially played with my husband, though he checked out in the first 2 hours due to slow story progression, which wasn't really an issue for me. Little did I know, 79 hours later I'm stuck with 3 uncompleted quests, 2 of which now say 'wait for the story to be continued', my storage is maxed out, villagers' stories are hard to follow because it takes forever to get to the next level with them and you don't have anything to do in the meantime + once you do get the quest you complete it in like 10 minutes and that's it

Laid-back and the visuals/aesthetics are great. 

However paying USD$50.00 for an outfit is ABSOLUTELY predatory. 

Game froze when I tried to exit. 

6/10

There's so much to say. I love this game, its an amazing life sim and you can do so so much. From the tiniest little details in your house / land to building relationships with the npc's and discovering well put together lands. Let alone the music, it's so calming and gives you a really good feeling. You really feel like you're in this world :)
Huge kudos to the team. Keep it up!
But I want this game to thrive. There are certainly big performance issues that come with it. If you have really good specs this might not be an issue for you, but as someone who has right above the recommended specs, this was a nightmare. It would often crash, and at one point I had to hard reset my pc because it didn't let me out of the game when I wanted to leave. My pc has never reached such high temperatures with any game compared to Palia. My partner's laptop battery even died for a while because of Palia. Because of this I've come to the conclusion it is unplayable until this is fixed. I apologize for me not recommending this, but I want people to know that this game can fry ur pc esp if your below the recommended specs. Other than that, It's a very good game that I can't wait to play again.

Although this game definitely still needs some bug-fixing and QOL updates to be done, it's such a cozy game and I really love just progressing through it. I really hope they'll add some more dialogue to the characters as well.

This is a great casual game with surprising depth and high production value. Really appreciate all the thoughtful decisions they've made in the design of the game that make it fun to run around, explore, and progress along the way, without much in the way of negative consequences. They've borrowed a lot of popular things from a lot of games, harvest moon/stardew for sure, and brought those elements together in a fun way. I'm glad this game is online. It's fun to be around other people doing whatever they're doing (watches neighbor pull giant chest out of a pool with a fishing pole). I hope to see the world expand in breadth and depth in over time.

I love Palia!! I am having so much fun! Just wish there were more quests, secret things and just in general more things to do, Ranching would be a blast. Racing the Sarnaks or even a new species and win prizes for winning. I would buy things from the store too but they are priced too high for me. I think with just a few improvements this could be a fabulous game! It is already well on it's way.
