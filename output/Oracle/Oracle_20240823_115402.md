# About Oracle

Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) is a multinational computer technology corporation headquartered in Austin, Texas. The company was founded on June 16, 1977, by Larry Ellison, Bob Miner, and Ed Oates. Oracle specializes in database software and technology, cloud-engineered systems, and enterprise software products. The company offers a wide range of services, including software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offerings.

As of September 2023, Oracle employs approximately 158,400 people ([Bloomberg, April 2024](https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/04/30/oracle-has-more-office-workers-in-california-than-texas-after-moving-headquarters/)). The company generates revenue primarily through its cloud services, database management systems, and enterprise software solutions. Oracle's customers are primarily businesses (B2B), including major corporations like Walmart and Amazon, although it has faced challenges in retaining some of these clients due to its business practices ([Box-o-bees, Reddit, 2019-09-09](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/d1ttzp/oracle_is_going_after_companies_using_virtualbox/ezqlobx/)).

Oracle's products are distributed through direct sales, partnerships, and online platforms. Over time, the company has shifted its focus towards cloud services and AI, with significant investments in these areas. Recent developments include the introduction of generative AI capabilities and strategic partnerships with companies like Google Cloud ([PR Newswire, June 2024](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oracle-and-google-cloud-announce-a-groundbreaking-multicloud-partnership-302169907.html)).

#### Recent Developments
- **Headquarters Move**: Oracle moved its headquarters from California to Texas in 2021, but recent reports indicate that it still has more employees in California than Texas, with about 6,900 workers in California compared to 2,500 in Texas ([Bloomberg, April 2024](https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/04/30/oracle-has-more-office-workers-in-california-than-texas-after-moving-headquarters/)).

She recently stepped down from Disney's board after six years, highlighting her significant role in both companies ([Variety, July 2024](https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/disney-board-oracle-safra-catz-1236078640/)).

### Challenges and Changes

This decision reflects broader challenges in the advertising sector, including regulatory pressures and competition ([Adweek, June 2024](https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/exclusive-oracle-will-end-all-of-its-ad-products-by-sept-30/)).
