      <p>Doctors don't care. But if you're looking for a super easy doctors note to get out of work or you will be tardy use this app. Mind you your mychart now has virtual urgent care and you actually video chat with a doctor on mychart virtual urgent care. 98point6 they only text you. They won't back track a doctors note for you. But mychart will gladly write your note to be excused for the day before especially if you can't make it in the day you are actually sick and can only visit the next day</p>

      <p>I am so grateful my husband's job offers this as a benefit. We have two little kids who, as well known, tend to get sick pretty often. On our area, it is nearly impossible to get the same day appointment with the doctor. Plus, daycare requires doctors note if we wanted to get a partial refund on the tuition for missing days - this app allows us (at no cost since it is offered as a benefit) from the comfort of our home get in touch with a doctor at any time of the day. GOD SENT! ❤️</p>

      <p>APP works but doctors are listed but NOT necessarily local. Had poisoning from AZ plant, got a NY dr or nurse practitioner, not sure. Had no idea what my issue was. No results only a wasted text/time. 1 min video and texting the rest of the "visit". Not sure this is real medical care. It's text care??!!?? Not impressed at all. At least it was 0$ as it wasn't worth a penny. Sorry. Lame telemedicine. But app works. Asks huge amt of questions and took 2 weeks to be registered correctly. Pftt!</p>

      <h4>Poor customer service, 1 stars (Jdubz8910, Apple App Store, 2023-12-23)</h4>
      <p>You have no email address for customer satisfaction. It is evident that this service lacks a customer-centric approach, as there are no available options to express concerns or provide feedback. This lack of consideration for customer satisfaction is disappointing and raises questions about the service's commitment to improving and addressing customer needs. I hope that you will take this feedback into consideration and implements a system that allows customers to express their concerns and provide feedback in the future.

Over the past week, my children have been home sick from school, and we have been cautious about having any visitors. Unfortunately, I have been experiencing symptoms that lead me to suspect I may have contracted strep throat, although I cannot be entirely certain. In an attempt to seek medical advice conveniently, I decided to utilize the 98.6 app, a service provided by our employer. Previously, we had been using Teldoc for the past 20 years, but our employer recently switched to 98.6, which has proven to be an inconvenience and a waste of time, with no added convenience.

During my recent interaction with the 98.6 app, I had the opportunity to consult with the FNP-BC, a Nurse Practitioner based in New York, NY. As a provider responsible for handling calls from subscribed employees, it is crucial that her professionalism and respect reflect the value of the service that employers pay for. The purpose of this service is to provide employees with prompt and convenient care, and it is essential that her behavior aligns with this objective.

Unfortunately, my experience with Nurse  was far from satisfactory. After expressing a differing opinion, she abruptly terminated the visit, displaying a lack of professionalism and cowardice. It is concerning to think that someone with such behavior is responsible for caring for patients. I strongly urge you to review her patient transcripts for overall patient satisfaction and consider the impact her actions may have on the reputation of the service.</p>

      <p>Both my wife and I have tried this app and the result is the same. You have to answer a ton of questions then you get a warning that they rarely give prescriptions which turned out to be true. 

Basically the doctor gives you the “I’m sorry you feel bad. Just wait it out.” I get that some Doctors just hand out prescriptions to everyone and they certainly don’t want to be the online pharmacy, but with the warning before you even meet the Dr you get a sense they’ll take your insurance company’s money, but not any risk to actually treat someone.

The advantage to the Doctors is that they never get a personal review because the Doctor who will diagnose you will be chosen by the app.

Anyway if you want a Doctor’s sympathy this is the app for you.</p>

I could not get him In yesterday and with it being a Saturday today the only places near me where Urgent Cares which we’re wanting $100 upfront even with insurance. I felt defeated because I did not have the money at the time. I saw my insurance offered this app at $0 cost so I tried it. I’m so glad I did it was super quick and easy to use. We had a short video chat but most of it was by text. The doctor was very nice and helpful. She sent in a lot of useful information. He was diagnosed and sent in a prescription to the pharmacy of my choosing. Now my son can get better thanks to this app and the very appreciated doctors. 

It is a great app to use for adults and parents that are unable to drive or that just is having a hard time being seen by someone same day. The have doctors available every day of the week on this app. I’m so lucky to have used it. Thank you 98point6!</p>

I will not use this service again, I could only imagine if it was something more serious it would be a waste of time just like this was.

      <p>I gave this app 3 tries and all ended in poor outcomes. 1st time I was waiting for an hour or so and never received a notification to meet with a doctor. I gave it another try when my daughter had an eye infection and needed antibiotics. The physician advised to apply ice to her eye and go into the doctors office if it got worse, she would not write a prescription. The third time, my daughter had an allergic reaction in her eye with severe swelling, she needed steroids but the physician refused to write a prescription and advised to use otc meds which we had already tried. We ended up having to go to an urgent care and the physician there wrote a prescription for steroids. If you enjoy wasting your time then this app is for you.</p>

      <p>My company pays for this app, every doctor I have ever seen pretty much just tells you to sleep it off and/ or prescribes over the counter meds, they pretty much state in the terms before you are seen that they pretty much refuse to prescribe antibiotics or anything that actually treats your symptoms. Also, from my experience the physicians are not well qualified and don’t take your symptoms into consideration whatsoever. For example: I have had a sore throat for almost 2 weeks now and can never get to the doctors office because they work the same hours I do… I told the doctor my symptoms and told him that I have been taking antihistamines and nasal spray that have been working but my throat is still killing me; he proceeded to prescribe me the same antihistamines and nasal spray that I had already been taking none of which would help my throat whatsoever… It also takes a good 30-45 minutes to finish your appointment because it’s ALL texting. Long story short, Doctor On Demand is the way to go if you want a doctor who will actually take you seriously and respect your time.</p>

      <p>I wasn’t able to drive today due to my equilibrium being off kilter with my ear and sinus infection. This virtual visit made it possible to “see” a doctor via video in less than 5 minutes! The attention to detail and live conversation to understand my symptoms and health history was outstanding and efficient! The doctor demonstrated genuine concern and quickly assessed my symptoms to diagnose my illness. A prescription was sent to the local pharmacy before the virtual session ended along with additional care instructions to improve my health. Great service all around in about 20 minutes! Highly recommended!!</p>

      <p>All they do is recommend over the counter medication- if you want real help - you’ll still have to go into an office for basic antibiotic prescriptions. Update to first review; two days later - I’ve followed her recommendations and used all the OTC products and I’m still sick - zero improvement, some deterioration. I understand some people abuse antibiotics- but this doctor didn’t even talk to me other than to verify my name and birthday. If she had taken the time to speak with me over the zoom, she could have ascertained that I do in fact have a bacterial infection. Instead, she texted a very general, “one size fits all” recommendation. I think it’s a waste of money for business to use this service for their employees. Their doctor told me I had to be sick for at least 10 days for her to consider antibiotics. Update 2, woke up with severe conjunctivitis in my left eye.  I was unable to open it because of hardened puss - a sign of a bacterial infection according to CDC.</p>

      <p>This app is offered through my insurance for free. Which is helpful since I don’t get a copay option to visit any primary care physician. Let me just say that this is where technology draws the line - getting healthcare over text (which is their primary communication method) seems ineffective. For a start, the amount of intake questions they ask you before you’re connected to an actual provider is insane. I quit the app on multiple occasions because I was annoyed at answering the questions. Another thing is there are limited situations that would warrant discussing a medical issue over text. You might be ok with a very mild issue like a cold or season allergies but even then you would typically just get something over the counter from a store. I would only recommend this as a resource to get general questions answered about health, not to receive treatment.</p>

This app used to be great and very helpful. I saved a lot of time treating minor things in the past years. Unfortunately now the doctors will just tell you to go to an urgent care if they think you need antibiotics. They are trying to avoid prescribing them so much so that they would rather avoid giving you a diagnosis even if it’s obvious. Not only that but also the yearly price is now astronomical compared to before. I will not be renewing and would not recommend for people to use it for anything other than if you have something that doesn’t require any real treatment.</p>

Don’t wasted your money paying these doc that sit back and collect your money. They don’t seem happy about there job as it seem.</p>

      <h4>Getting worse over time, 1 stars (Jentropy, Apple App Store, 2022-06-26)</h4>
      <p>My partner has used this for a few years now as primary care for a well managed chronic condition because he’s uninsured and we’re poor but don’t qualify for Medicaid. 

At first it was great. Even though he gets a new provider at every visit, they’re typically decent enough and he’s been able to avoid hospital visits and complications of his conditions. 

Lately, though, the care has been sub-par. He gets shamed by the doctors for not having a doctor to see in person, even though his condition is well managed and he’s told them he can’t afford any other care. We pay out of pocket for routine labs and do everything they ask, but each appointment makes him feel worse than the last. They also act like they’re going to cut him off and stop treating him any day now, which would likely trigger permanent harm and complications due to lack of access to his maintenance meds, which are safe and he’s been using for many years. 

It’s time to start shopping around for a new telemedicine service.</p>

the visit. will let my insurance company know my disappointment and that they can probably now pay for an office visit and potentially more medical needs due to poor care provided.  won’t be using this service and will let my CEO know as well</p>

      <p>The app itself is a pretty good concept, however I feel that perhaps some of the doctors they work with could be better? I used the app for the first time today, answered the pre-“visit” questions (not bad there), and then when my virtual doctor joined, it was more or less the doctor messaging the entire time, not letting me really get a word in, and trying to push things on me without me getting to tell him what I was looking for as an end result. I told the doctor my issue and asked if it were possible for a script (nothing with painkillers or anything they aren’t allowed to prescribe), to which the doctor essentially ignored me and recommended things I have been doing to no avail throughout being sick. I informed the doctor that his advice was not something that was working, however I would give one of his solutions a try (it was clear he had no interest in helping me, as my primary care would have) and wrapped up the conversation asap. Again, I like the concept of this app; I think it’s a great idea…just not so much the staff that partners with the app. It all felt impersonal and like a quick cash grab.</p>

      <p>I used teledoc for a long time and loved it. It saved me many times from having to urgent care or office visit for simple issues and required prescriptions. So helpful when you are busy and live in an super urban area where exposure to covid in waiting rooms is a guarantee. But 96point6 physicians will listen to your symptoms, and tell you every time that you have to go to an urgent care or primary care office for *insert whatever*.

Its kind of like, why waste your time and money when they are just going to send you in anyway? Poor quality compared to teledoc.</p>

      <p>The 98point6 app only has an iPhone version and has not been fully optimized to be used on iPad in landscape orientation. Very frustrating as it is more convenient for me to organize my healthcare through my iPad VS my phone and I would rather have my appointments on my iPad so I can sit at my desk. 

Hopefully there will be an iPad version of this app in the future, when that happens I will most likely change my review to 5 stars as I really have no other issues regarding the service. Being unable to fully support iPad OS is my biggest dealbreaker with apps.</p>

      <p>Both my daughter and I have reached out to Doctors on this app only to be referred to the med express for a minor skin issues. Now most Doctors give a script for antibiotics, these Doctors are rude, curt and refer you to Med express. This app was good but in the second year took a nose dive. Unenrolled this - stopped the bleeding of my cash for no help.</p>

      <p>I needed a 3-day gap prescription of medication, requiring a televisit & submitting my prescription to the pharmacy. After downloading & signing-up for the “98point6” membership, the app was stuck where it required my profile to contain a pharmacy. I searched for support and left 2-messages, at non-human alternatives, unable to start a session because the app doesn’t allow you to progress until your profile contains your pharmacy preference. 4-hours later, miraculously, the app let me choose a pharmacy. From there I submitted my medical issue. The doctor was very kind and supportive but couldn’t help me a bit because not only could she NOT prescribe scheduled medicines by a required tele-visit, she couldn’t submit the prescription to a pharmacy without an approval to submit electronically. I wasted the entire time and effort from the beginning moment I believed this app was a solution. PROCEED WITH CAUTION; READ EVERYTHING; I DID AND SEE WHERE I LANDED?</p>

      <p>Worst doctors! I used this ap to try to get a refill that didn’t happen. I ended up going to push health and got it refilled. Second time using this app I was wanting to get antibiotics for my sons ear infection, I looked inside his ear with an otoscope and it was really red. This is not his first ear infection. The dr said to get him tested for covid. What?! He had an ear at infection not covid. He has really bad allergies that causes fluid in his ears. Well it caused an ear infection in his left ear. The dr said it is probably a cold causing the redness in the ear and will go away in a few days. I told her no it’s an ear infection and he needs antibiotics . She wouldn’t help. I took him to his pediatrician she confirmed the ear infection and prescribed antibiotics. I was hoping the app would of been useful but it’s a joke along with the crappy drs.</p>

      <p>The doctor’s on this service are extremely condescending. They also apparently can only treat any illnesses or infections once, so you’re paying $120 a year plus a $1 a visit to receive absolutely no help. My most recent visit, I wasn’t even looking for a prescription or treatment. I sent details and pictures of the area of concern and all I wanted was advice on whether or not I needed to be seen in person. The doctor rudely told me that he couldn’t help because I was treated for the same thing 7 months ago. He said to continue to do the things I was already doing to treat the problem. No other advice given. Turns out I have a massive infection in my lymph node and needed to be out on antibiotics immediately. No testing done at urgent care, I was simply diagnosed by my symptoms and the doctor looking at the are. Same I provided to the DR in this service. What is the point of this service if they can’t actually treat or diagnose you.</p>

      <p>Getting through the testing and questions can be frustrating when feeling like you want to talk with someone immediately. But really it’s just like a 15minuts effort which is excellent compared to an office visit.  

I can’t actually see this review as I type, but the doctor was helpful and answered our questions. We were directed to still call our child’s primary care physician during business hours, but we were assured we didn’t need to panic and  she helped us understand the level of urgency - in our case low thankfully!</p>

      <h4>Meh., 3 stars (agcbrc0204, Apple App Store, 2021-06-21)</h4>
      <p>We had Teledoc through my employer and I liked that much better. 

First, let me say that I am 100000000% good with the text-based format, because anyone that knows me can tell you that phone calls are the bane of my existence. With that being said, I had to do a video call with the doctor for my visit before she would start evaluating my issue. It was probably 5 or 10 seconds, nothing long, and then we began texting. I honestly wish we had just finished the visit through the video chat since we had to do it in the beginning anyway. I ended up having to type out long responses while tending to my infant son and trying to get ready for work at the same time. It ended up taking a lot longer than I had anticipated to create all these replies to all the questions she asked. If we already had to do the video chat, I wish we could have just finished the entire visit that way. 

Second, the reason for my call was an earache. I woke up that morning with my ear killing me. I did a visit on this app and the doctor said to get Flonase and Sudafed and that should help. I asked about antibiotic ear drops and didn’t get any. I realize that my doctor couldn’t actually examine my ear so she couldn’t tell whether or not it was an infection, but honestly what would have been the harm in just giving me some ear drops? I dealt with the problem for 3 more months trying to get the issue to go away with Flonase and Sudafed before I woke up with a stabbing pain in my ear and went to my PCP, and as it turns out I’ve had an ear infection for the past 3 months. I understand not wanting to prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily but if have zero complaints about sinus issues, no drainage, doesn’t hurt on the outer ear, and it’s been going on for several weeks, what would have been the harm in some antibiotic ear drops? I don’t think there would have been any harm. 

This format just isn’t effective and feels rushed, like you have to stop whatever you’re doing to reply so that you aren’t keeping the visit from ending. It sounds like it would be conducive to a busy lifestyle but I didn’t find it effective. And the care seems to be subpar. A coworker of mine had a visit the day after mine and she had a sinus infection. The doctor on the app didn’t give her antibiotics either. What do they have against antibiotics?!</p>

      <p>Our insurance signed my family up for this during the pandemic. The first two visits were really good.  I would have highly recommended. Then the last two visits happened. I not only will no longer use this but I’m going share with everyone I know not to use! Both visits all the Doctors cared about was COVID and pushing the COVID vaccination. We understand being concerned with COVID but not everything is COVID! And when they are told you already tested negative and they continue only talking about COVID. That’s unacceptable! Also no vaccination is supposed to be given to anyone who is sick. Adults, children, infants, the elderly.  It doesn’t matter and a medical doctor SHOULD KNOW THIS! They did nothing to help at either visit. And we mean nothing! They didn’t listen to any of the list of things that you answer before logging in. Anything said while chatting. Neither Doctor ever got on the video chat like they are supposed to do. Oh and the wait times were way longer then estimated. So if you want no help, to waste your money, and to waste an hour or more off your day then this is perfect! Seems like a great idea to get seen without going to a hospital, urgent care ,etc. or your primary can’t get you in and you don’t have to risk catching something else. BUT they do nothing to actually treat you. After both visits we had the family members taken to our local urgent care and both times they needed medical treatment and or medication.  Medication that should have and could have been given through the doctors on this app. Also 98.6 sends you emails asking how you’re visit went. Both times the surveys were answered with the truth and how bad the service was. Do you think we heard anything back? NOPE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! 

So This review is being written and we hope that it will be a cautionary tale about this app and what to expect.</p>

      <p>Doctors on this app do not prescribe anything. They will tell you do salt water gargles or take over the counter medications which most of the people already tried before they go to a doctor. So what is the point of wasting your time on this app. It is better to go to urgent care and get antibiotics to help in your throat.I will never use this app again.</p>

      <h4>Don’t waste your time. Won’t prescribe., 1 stars (Jfkvkek dmckwns, Apple App Store, 2020-12-29)</h4>
      <p>Got this app for a quick prescription for a yeast infection without urgent care fees or time spent on an appointment. Tried 3 different docs. All of them told me to see someone in person or get labs done first??? I’m a female I know what a yeast infection feels like. Honestly this app is just an advertisement for LabCorp/Quest who they’re obviously partnered with because they tried to make me pay for labs or appointments with them every time. I found other apps who will write a simple antifungal rx without forcing labs and appointments down my throat (WHICH NEGATES THE PURPOSE OF MOBILE CARE). Don’t waste your money on this scam.</p>

      <p>Pay $1 to hear “go to urgent care”, waste of time. It was useful once a year ago and since then my wife and I have only ever gotten a response of “go to your doctor”.... I’m supposedly talking to a doctor!!!</p>

      <h4>You will NOT receive care after 1st visit, 1 stars (SLS-RN, Apple App Store, 2020-12-23)</h4>
      <p>I began using the service bc I am an emergency response COVID19 RN responding to overwhelmed hospitals across the country so I needed to find an alternative to traditional urgent/ primary care. I only actually received a treatment plan that matched my chief complaint & symptoms on my 1st visit. I was so impressed I purchased a year subscription which I later discovered had been a huge waste of $$ & my time which I have very little of these days. Every time I have attempted to seek treatment for extremely basic/common urgent care illnesses i have ended up having to seek treatment from another company/provider bc the 98point6 providers have refused to actually listen to me or I have been sent for unnecessary laboratory tests that take days to come back and refuse to actually meanwhile I was suffering from a bladder infection that became a kidney infection while waiting for a lab test to tell the provider that it’s okay to give antibiotics!!! I was told to go to the ER for PINK eye and I $$$  for another telehealth provider whom immediately recognized the acute illness provided the proper treatment and I made a full recovery but lost more $$! Every time you  access the app to seek medical treatment the providers will classify every illness you have been treated for in the past as a “chronic” condition and will refuse to treat you and tell you to go seek a health care provider!! Lol I mean I thought that was what I was doing but I guess not! It’s just a waste of time and $$ and you will never be bc able to get a refund on your subscription plan that doesn’t actually exist bc the providers only care about making their $$</p>

      <p>Are used this app for the first time in a situation where I needed a prescription and my primary doctors office is closed for the next couple days.

      <h4>Cheap price for cheap service, 1 stars (MimimichelleLiu, Apple App Store, 2020-12-12)</h4>
      <p>Doctor ignored my main issue which is coughing. The prescriptions were for sneezing and running nose which I don’t have. I didn’t realize that until late but I think that was because the doctor pushed too fast. Whole visit was done in less than 2 min. Now I’m doubting whether he really read all information I entered before the visit. He didn’t ask anything about any symptoms during the visit so I thought he was sure. Now thinking about it, it felt like he was just giving out suggestions based on computer result which he didn’t even evaluate. I can be wrong and I hope I’m wrong, but my issue was not really addressed and answered. And there’s not an option on the app to make complaints about doctors so I figured they would just expect me to leave a negative feedback so I did. I don’t recommend this app if you’re serious about your health.</p>

      <p>My daughter has strep. I came down with a horrible sore throat and fever. Instead of going to the doctor and exposing myself to covid or another illness, (I live in a hot spot) I used the 98.6 app. The doctor that I spoke with, informed me that they could NOT give me an antibiotic without being swabbed for strep-even though my daughter’s was confirmed the day before. What is  the point of this app? So, instead of paying one doctors visit, I’m having to pay for two. Don’t waste your money or time!</p>
