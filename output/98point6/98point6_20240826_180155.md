# About 98point6

98point6 is a digital healthcare company founded on March 1, 2015, and headquartered in Seattle, Washington [(Crunchbase, 2024)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/98point6). The company offers a text-based virtual care service that provides personalized consultation, diagnosis, and treatment to patients through a mobile app. The service is available 24/7 and aims to make healthcare more accessible and affordable by leveraging technology and board-certified physicians.

The company initially operated as a virtual primary care provider but pivoted to focus on licensing its telehealth software to healthcare providers. This strategic shift was solidified with the acquisition of its virtual care business by Transcarent in March 2023 for up to $100 million [(Tracxn, 2021)](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/98point6/__CXnfm7ynYYw-600ITK_cfsQpnzQZ5EyDffQDrYygmW0). As of December 2022, 98point6 had approximately 398 employees [(Tracxn, 2021)](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/98point6/__CXnfm7ynYYw-600ITK_cfsQpnzQZ5EyDffQDrYygmW0).

98point6 generates revenue through a subscription model, offering unlimited virtual visits for a fixed annual fee. The company serves both B2B and B2C markets, with notable partnerships including Walgreens and SteadyMD [(SteadyMD, 2023)](https://www.steadymd.com/blog/98point6-technologies-collaborates-with-steadymd-to-offer-comprehensive-virtual-care-solution-to-healthcare-organizations/). The company has raised a total of $305 million in funding across multiple rounds, with the latest being a $32 million Series E round in April 2023 [(Crunchbase, 2024)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/98point6).

## Comprehensive Report on 98point6 Technologies and its Product

### Company Overview
98point6 Technologies, founded in 2015 and based in Seattle, is a leader in licensed on-demand virtual care software. The company initially operated as a virtual primary care provider but pivoted to focus on licensing its telehealth software to healthcare providers. This strategic shift was solidified with the acquisition of its virtual care business by Transcarent in March 2023 for up to $100 million [(Tracxn, 2021)](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/98point6/__CXnfm7ynYYw-600ITK_cfsQpnzQZ5EyDffQDrYygmW0). As of December 2022, 98point6 had approximately 398 employees [(Tracxn, 2021)](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/98point6/__CXnfm7ynYYw-600ITK_cfsQpnzQZ5EyDffQDrYygmW0).

### Recent Developments
#### Acquisition of Bright.md
On January 16, 2024, 98point6 announced the acquisition of the remaining assets of Bright.md, a provider of asynchronous telehealth solutions, to enhance its offerings. This acquisition included 16 customer contracts and was structured as 45% cash and 55% equity [(PR Newswire, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html); [(Healthcare Dive, 2024)](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/98point6-buys-bright-md-assets/704661/). The integration of Bright.md's technology is expected to accelerate the launch of 98point6's new asynchronous care module, which allows healthcare providers to communicate with patients at their convenience, thereby addressing clinician burnout and improving patient engagement [(Vator, 2024)](https://vator.tv/news/2024-01-16-98point6-buys-contracts-from-brightmd-launches-asynchronous-care-module).

#### Strategic Partnerships
In October 2023, 98point6 formed a strategic partnership with SteadyMD, a B2B telehealth infrastructure provider.

# Apple App Store Reviews
## Waste of time, 1 stars [(baba coo coo, Apple App Store, 2024-08-23)](https://apple/11644902144)
Dr assumed I have viral infection so she would not prescribe  anything.  I have a painful eye infection and a swollen face and she decided  it was a cold.  No antibiotic or steroid.  How do you assume someone has a virus infection vs bacterial based on the intake questions and no culture.  If your guidelines don’t allow these prescribers to prescribe medication why not explain  that up front .   Total waste of time .

## So helpful, 5 stars [(Beckyaselby, Apple App Store, 2024-08-15)](https://apple/11612903769)
This app was efficient, helpful and easy to use. I am very satisfied with the questions that lead to the diagnosis and care plan.

## Unprofessional app, 1 stars [(Hsudgjsjsjsnsi, Apple App Store, 2024-08-14)](https://apple/11611395650)
Very poor service if you can go for other app

## Wow., 5 stars [(Ms Jacquelyn in AZ, Apple App Store, 2024-08-04)](https://apple/11573413962)
So easy. Thank you health insurance company.

## First Time User, 5 stars [(Tonyh0ck48, Apple App Store, 2024-07-18)](https://apple/11508226229)
I love this app. It was fast easy and perfect without having to wait for an appointment or spend big money on a co-pay for emergency room or urgent care. Only negative clinician didn’t explain in detail the different types ailment in my specific case, so I didn’t understand why I wasn’t getting any medication. but hey, isn’t that why Google was invent and what it’s for! Over all Awesome!

## Dr, 5 stars [(Candyleomanh, Apple App Store, 2024-07-13)](https://apple/11488930939)
She is always so nice

## Easy going process, 5 stars [(420 social butterfly, Apple App Store, 2024-07-12)](https://apple/11485591903)
This was a very easy process and minimal wait time! AI takes all the info regarding your issue by answering the questions asked of the patient and submitting any photos to help diagnose? Then you get to speak with the real doctor.. it beats having to wait months to get into see real doctor!

## Lots of questions before talking to a doc, 1 stars [(Micky0504, Apple App Store, 2024-07-07)](https://apple/11466860060)
It says you’ll be chatting within minutes after answering ‘just a few short questions’ then auto generates what seems like never ending questions. Almost would have been quicker to drive to a Dr. Once you connect to the doc, they ask you some of the same questions or you have to re-explain.

## Great, 5 stars [(dhdudidv, Apple App Store, 2024-06-20)](https://apple/11404738505)
Very convenient

## Not worth the wait, 1 stars [(KellieBurch, Apple App Store, 2024-06-18)](https://apple/11394705975)
The “average wait times” are NOT accurate. I’ve used the app a few times and I’ve been told to either buy over the counter meds or go to a doctor.  I thought was the whole point of this app was to keep you out of a doctors office. Last time I tried to use the app, the wait time was less than 2 mins. I waited 45 mins before I closed out the app. Complete waste of time.

## Doctors cannot do anything, 1 stars [(Anne bcjsnwndnn, Apple App Store, 2024-06-17)](https://apple/11393087784)
Cannot neither diagnose nor monitor existing diagnoses. Was told to go to primary care, a specialist or urgent care. What can these doctors actually do? It isn’t primary care when they tell you to go to primary care.

## WOW!, 5 stars [(D_Russ, Apple App Store, 2024-06-17)](https://apple/11390454013)
This is the first time I’ve ever used a virtual doctor app and my mind is BLOWN! It was FAST, super detail oriented and they took care of me! No waiting for an appointment, no waiting hours to see a doc… it is 24/7, so I got to text with a doc (which was the best part) at 1am from my couch I highly recommend this to anyone who needs to see a doctor with something that’s not major problem!

## Fine for basic problems, 2 stars [(scutwk, Apple App Store, 2024-06-11)](https://apple/11370624806)
There is nothing to gain that you can not learn from a simple google symptom search. The clinicians don’t have access to your records, no labs, no imaging. I’m not sure who this is serving.

## Why waste time?, 1 stars [(PHXOG, Apple App Store, 2024-06-07)](https://apple/11355774107)
I answered a question stating the length of my symptoms on a vital questionnaire. While I went through the process just to be told go to an urgent care because my symptoms did not meet timeline protocol. Chronic sinus infections are common in Arizona.

## Waste of time, 1 stars [(Star Cluster, Apple App Store, 2024-06-04)](https://apple/11343933139)
Put in my symptoms spoke with a doc and he said go see your primary care doc. Gee thanks for your professional opinion.

## I like it but I wish a voice conversation option was offered, 4 stars [(Britt M. F., Apple App Store, 2024-06-03)](https://apple/11340711057)
I like it but I wish a voice conversation option was offered.

## Fine, I guess, 3 stars [(Sorg12, Apple App Store, 2024-06-01)](https://apple/11333205037)
While I appreciate that I can talk to a provider, I HATE that this is a text based platform. A video call would have been quicker. Video would also be a lot easier for a lot of people when they’re not feeling well.

## Overall experience, 5 stars [(TJ Skins, Apple App Store, 2024-05-29)](https://apple/11321372318)
I called my local doctor this morning hoping to get a telemedicine appointment as I tested positive for Covid & am very sick. I got no call back but my son told me about this app this is now available to me through my current employer.

This was my first time using this app. I have fallen in love. My children always seem to get sick on the weekend or late at night when it’s almost impossible to get to a doctor or Sunday when they are closed. Also they dislike going to the doctor as many children. This was quick easy and painless. Took a total of 30 minutes. I would highly recommend.

This app has helped me more than once. I live in an area where it takes 6 months to a year to get a doctor if they decide to pick you up as a patient. This app has helped get my medications when I am without a doctor. The doctor I (different every time) have always been helpful, polite, and understanding. Truly a life saver. Thank you!!

## Worst Telehealth service ever, 1 stars [(Sunflowergirll, Apple App Store, 2024-03-24)](https://apple/11081010289)
This service makes me miss my old insurances Telehealth so much. The service providers always direct you to go be seen in person, they never listen to your past and your history and treat you like a child not an adult, when you know your body. For example as a woman with recurrent UTI’s instead of helping you they make you go see someone in person. I have never experienced this with any other service provider. I have had strep throat and sent pictures in and the provider argued with me that it was not strep and I wouldn’t know and told me to see someone in person. Of course it was. This app is a waste of time, I wish I could get paid to tell someone to go see someone else all day

## Useless, 1 stars [(jxbhduufjjdkdkjd, Apple App Store, 2024-03-23)](https://apple/11077035493)

Useless service that gives terrible advice for patients whose symptoms are worsening, and they tell you to do what you have been doing for over 3 weeks. Of course this is after they charge you for the non-service.

## Failed in its concept., 1 stars [(tuleshed, Apple App Store, 2024-03-02)](https://apple/11001094000)
It should’ve been fast and simple, instead it was difficult. The physician wanted clear, black-and-white answers to questions that had a level of subjectiveness. The physician recommended OTC medication that most of us are already familiar with. The NP seemed intent on taking as much time to debate small points that were already articulated to the best of my ability. The other remote doctor service was much better.

## CANNOT HAVE A VISIT OUTSIDE OF APP, 1 stars [(LITAPITA1, Apple App Store, 2024-02-19)](https://apple/10958530506)
The app is not functioning on my phone currently and I contacted customer service to see if I could have a phone or web visit and was told that I could not. I have used this service many times and physicians have also called me to conduct a visit, so I am unsure as to why I wouldn’t  be able have an alternative option for a visit. I need my medicines desperately and this is totally ridiculous.

Developer responded by telling me to contact technical service which I already did before I left my feedback. Contacting them was pointless and a waste of time.  I had to make an account just to receive messages from them.

They don’t actually want to help you and they end up telling you to go to urgent care, for a sinus infection a UTI or anything you bring up to them. These are the things they are supposed to be able to help you with in this application and it’s not happening.

## Great option to a two hour wait at the Walk-in clinic., 5 stars [(Mike’s Uber Reviews, Apple App Store, 2024-01-05)](https://apple/10788420459)
I’ve used 98.6 twice now, instead of going to my local walk-in clinic (for minor sinus infection type issues) and the on-line visit has been awesome each time.  The doctors are very nice, and thorough, with their recommendations.  I will use this service first before going to the walk-in, especially so that I don’t have to wait 2 hours in the waiting room.  Both of my visits have been completed in less than 15 minutes.  Thank you so much!

## Great experience for first time, 5 stars [(rphmom67, Apple App Store, 2024-01-05)](https://apple/10787491208)
First time using the Telehealth and it takes a few minutes like filling out information so the doctor can properly treat you.. but the experience was great with the doctor making sure he got the correct information and understanding why I was taking the medication, the correct dosages, to make sure I was doing ok on the medication, to make sure he was sending the refills to the correct pharmacy, and making sure everything was correct before completing the visit.  It was a great experience and I will definitely recommend it to my fellow employees and patients who are able to use it!

They don’t ever prescribe anything they just give you a bunch of remedies and tell you to go to urgent care. It’s basically just a waste of time. Go to webmd and get the exact same info.

## Quick and helpful!, 5 stars [(Missymady97, Apple App Store, 2023-12-23)](https://apple/10736209622)
I was seen quickly, it was very easy to complete the pre screening questions. So much better than leaving my home to be exposed to different illnesses at an urgent care. The physician was also extremely helpful and quick to respond. Definitely will be using this in the future!

## Poor customer service, 1 stars [(Jdubz8910, Apple App Store, 2023-12-23)](https://apple/10735124104)
You have no email address for customer satisfaction. It is evident that this service lacks a customer-centric approach, as there are no available options to express concerns or provide feedback. This lack of consideration for customer satisfaction is disappointing and raises questions about the service's commitment to improving and addressing customer needs. I hope that you will take this feedback into consideration and implements a system that allows customers to express their concerns and provide feedback in the future.

Over the past week, my children have been home sick from school, and we have been cautious about having any visitors. Unfortunately, I have been experiencing symptoms that lead me to suspect I may have contracted strep throat, although I cannot be entirely certain. In an attempt to seek medical advice conveniently, I decided to utilize the 98.6 app, a service provided by our employer. Previously, we had been using Teldoc for the past 20 years, but our employer recently switched to 98.6, which has proven to be an inconvenience and a waste of time, with no added convenience.

During my recent interaction with the 98.6 app, I had the opportunity to consult with the FNP-BC, a Nurse Practitioner based in New York, NY. As a provider responsible for handling calls from subscribed employees, it is crucial that her professionalism and respect reflect the value of the service that employers pay for. The purpose of this service is to provide employees with prompt and convenient care, and it is essential that her behavior aligns with this objective.

Unfortunately, my experience with Nurse  was far from satisfactory. After expressing a differing opinion, she abruptly terminated the visit, displaying a lack of professionalism and cowardice. It is concerning to think that someone with such behavior is responsible for caring for patients. I strongly urge you to review her patient transcripts for overall patient satisfaction and consider the impact her actions may have on the reputation of the service.

## Spam Central, 1 stars [(delete spammer apps, Apple App Store, 2023-12-20)](https://apple/10725345923)
Prior to installing this app I never received spam calls.  Now I get 40 - 50 spam calls a day.  I am not an app hound installing every spyware app out there.  I have the basic app load from apple, so this app is apparently the culprit for this 3 year old phone.

## Another worthless app, 1 stars [(tipaz, Apple App Store, 2023-12-17)](https://apple/10708448277)
Will only offer general OTC recommendations and give no real help. Better to just spend your co-pay at urgent care.

## If you just want sympathy this is for you, 1 stars [(Danscott251973, Apple App Store, 2023-12-15)](https://apple/10697551795)
Both my wife and I have tried this app and the result is the same. You have to answer a ton of questions then you get a warning that they rarely give prescriptions which turned out to be true. 

Basically the doctor gives you the “I’m sorry you feel bad. Just wait it out.” I get that some Doctors just hand out prescriptions to everyone and they certainly don’t want to be the online pharmacy, but with the warning before you even meet the Dr you get a sense they’ll take your insurance company’s money, but not any risk to actually treat someone.

The advantage to the Doctors is that they never get a personal review because the Doctor who will diagnose you will be chosen by the app.

Anyway if you want a Doctor’s sympathy this is the app for you.

## The absolute worst app, 1 stars [(Emerald6991, Apple App Store, 2023-12-10)](https://apple/10679172256)
Everything is viral. After showing I tested negative for Covid and the flu they say my sore throat is caused by a viral infection and antibiotics won’t work. I’m so over this app. Every time I come on here the day go into urgent care. Just useless doctors.

There is no need to do anything else. The experience was so awful that I just have no desire to use the app and underlying “service.”  My review stands!

## Useless, 1 stars [(Jesus I can't find a nick name, Apple App Store, 2023-12-04)](https://apple/10657426617)
Every time I’m in need of a prescription they say go to an Urgent Care they never prescribe anything. The point of this app is to not need to go to the Urgent care centers and get my prescription. It’s like if I wanted to order shoes online and the website says to go to the actual store to get them. Not exactly but same concept it seems like. I don’t know why my company pays these people.

## Not helpful, 1 stars [(p;4, Apple App Store, 2023-11-27)](https://apple/10633648425)
Providers admit that they are limited in what they can do in the virtual environment and, after a long process and wait time, just refer you out to an in person provider. Skip this process and just go to the in person provider. This does not save you any time or energy.

## Treatment Pink Eye, 5 stars [(Rjazen, Apple App Store, 2023-11-26)](https://apple/10627838350)

## No care for patients, 1 stars [(Squirrel in the sky, Apple App Store, 2023-11-12)](https://apple/10579824287)
I understand with antibiotics the doctors follow strict guidelines, however it’s really interesting when a doctor sends you the guidelines to explain why he won’t give antibiotics for a sinus infection to a person with a weakened immune system for 10 day even though according to the guidelines in my situation it says 3-4 days and it’s been 3. This is after the first doctor brushed me off as a cold. Every time I use this app I’m directed to urgent care, what’s the point of even using it then?

It honestly makes me wish I did not give an honest history. Next time I won’t.

I have tried all day to get my 6 year old son seen today. I could not get him In yesterday and with it being a Saturday today the only places near me where Urgent Cares which we’re wanting $100 upfront even with insurance. I felt defeated because I did not have the money at the time. I saw my insurance offered this app at $0 cost so I tried it. I’m so glad I did it was super quick and easy to use. We had a short video chat but most of it was by text. The doctor was very nice and helpful. She sent in a lot of useful information. He was diagnosed and sent in a prescription to the pharmacy of my choosing. Now my son can get better thanks to this app and the very appreciated doctors. 

It is a great app to use for adults and parents that are unable to drive or that just is having a hard time being seen by someone same day. The have doctors available every day of the week on this app. I’m so lucky to have used it. Thank you 98point6!

Dr Balauag, Marlon was very thorough and polite. He ensured that my concerns were addressed. He made this first time use of this app very positive.

Two separate visits, both for rather innocuous assistance, and both times I'm told to seek care from a PCP. Entire point of app is to not seek care from a PCP. Useless, would not recommend to anyone.

Doctors don't care. But if you're looking for a super easy doctors note to get out of work or you will be tardy use this app. Mind you your mychart now has virtual urgent care and you actually video chat with a doctor on mychart virtual urgent care. 98point6 they only text you. They won't back track a doctors note for you. But mychart will gladly write your note to be excused for the day before especially if you can't make it in the day you are actually sick and can only visit the next day

Lately I can't seem to get past waiting for a code. I keep trying to get in to get a prescription filled but as soon as I open the app it requests I enter my phone number to request a code which never comes. I've checked and rechecked my number or blocked numbers on my phone and I still can't get past this screen. This is EXTREMELY frustrating!

The doctors on here are quacks. I would not use this app. I thought the purpose of this was to avoid the hospital or clinics. I came on here to try and get antibiotics. Was told to go to a clinic. I came on here so I wouldn't have to go to a clinic. You won't get anything but the run around with these doctors, so save your self time and go to a clinic and avoid these quacks

I am so grateful my husband's job offers this as a benefit. We have two little kids who, as well known, tend to get sick pretty often. On our area, it is nearly impossible to get the same day appointment with the doctor. Plus, daycare requires doctors note if we wanted to get a partial refund on the tuition for missing days - this app allows us (at no cost since it is offered as a benefit) from the comfort of our home get in touch with a doctor at any time of the day. GOD SENT! ❤️

The virtual assistant didn't understand any of my questions 9th¹1& also ended my session while I was describing my problem, causing me to have to start the intake registration over!

The first step is to verify your mobile number by entering a code that is texted to you. There is no other option. You're lucky if you get the code within five minutes core before it expires. This is common. Then you get into a queue after an idiotic chatbot asks you a bunch of redundant questions and you wait a long time. While you go about your life waiting for the doc, if you don't respond very quickly to the doc when they're ready, your session ends and is lost forever and you start over ag

No results only a wasted text/time. 1 min video and texting the rest of the "visit". Not sure this is real medical care. It's text care??!!?? Not impressed at all.

The app itself functions great but the service seems intended for extremely mild/minor issues. From the two times I've used the service, both times I was directed to urgent care or the ER. It seems, based on my experience, the physicians are very cautious in providing any diagnosis via telehealth. I get it, but then what's the point of the service if the best plan is always seeking in-person care?

4 visits were cancelled( 2 in one day) because I missed the push notification. I work, I cannot be expected to be near my phone for 3 hours hoping to hear one little ding. The doctor should call or the app should at least ring. I'm about to schedule my replacement visit. Hopefully I do not get cancelled for the 2nd time today.

Price is going up to $600 a year for a subscription. It will be super expensive

Raised their yearly price from $120 to $600. No longer affordable, not sure how I'm going to get my meds.

98.6 is trash. My wife is about to die coughing. That damn doc Woo didn't send her cough Rx to the pharmacy. If something bad happens to my wife. I'll sue 98.6! Promise

If I could rate it 0 stars I would. This is my 1st time using the app I did 2 visits because the 1st time the doctor gave me 5 minutes to log on, the app gave me no notification despite me having my notification on my phone. Then I waited another hour to see the same doctor and I picked up the call and there was no response. She said she couldn't get it to work so she ended the visit. In total I waited 3 hours to see nobody, I feel ripped off and just wasted my time and money, very unhappy.

The app is horrible. I've tried to have appointments twice. Both times, I've waiting for hours, never received any updates or notifications and then was kicked off the app for missing the appointments. Our health insurance covers the cost for visits on 98point6 so I was pretty excited to try it. Nope. I'll go back to the app I used to use and continue to pay $75/ visit.

There is no other way to get in at all besides getting a text code. That ridiculous. My phone is not receiving messages, so I just cannot have any access whatsoever????

you have to wait in a queue for your appointment an you are supposed to be alerted by a push notification when it's time, but push notifications often don't send and I just get an error message and miss my appointment.

My first experience was easy and smooth a nurse ask me questions about my current situation at the time to figure out what is causing my problem and she solved it my sending prescription to my pharmacy and my problem was gone.Thank you 98point6😊

Wrong. Just wrong. When the heart is hurting, getting further away from the heart causes more harm, not less. When you need telehealth in the middle of the night for an adult dependent, telling me to kindly f-off because they don't have the app installed and connected to my insurance doesn't help. Misunderstanding and misdiagnosis of the real problems has been my experience. Heart attack? No, it tells me, it's just stress. Looking for a mental health therapist? No, it tells me, you must be suici

Why can't they set up an appointment time instead of waiting for hours. Absolutely sucks and not helpful at all.

The website lists different conditions that are treated cough colds yeast infections UTIs these couldn't be treated without physically checking a patient.. but yet when I contacted a doctor over ear pressure sinus pressure symptoms I've had before when I've had an ear infection the doctor didn't want to treat it or call an antibiotic in and suggested I go see a doctor. Same thing I read on the other reviews this is a waste of time and money for my employer to offer this as a FREE service a joke

This is a revolution. Myself being hard-of-hearing on top of social anxiety this has been a life saver! So convenient to talk to a REAL doctor at home! Thankful for this app! Life should be simpler, and this app agrees.

I was told there would be a 2 hour wait but that the app would inform me when the doc arrived. The only notice I got was that my visit was ended because I didn't respond (never notified!!!) So frustrated

Its just the right thing to have in this day and time. Its a way of getting to talk to a doctor without even leaving the house and it cuts down on ER visits. I think its great.
