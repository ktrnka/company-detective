        <h1>About 98point6</h1>
<p><strong>98point6 Technologies</strong> is a digital health company founded in 2015, headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The company specializes in providing an AI-powered virtual care platform designed to enhance access to primary care through text-based communication. Initially, 98point6 operated as a telehealth provider but has since transitioned to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, focusing on licensing its technology to healthcare organizations.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2022, 98point6 employed approximately 398 people <a href="https://tracxn.com/d/companies/98point6/__CXnfm7ynYYw-600ITK_cfsQpnzQZ5EyDffQDrYygmW0">(Tracxn, 2021)</a>.
