<h2>Comprehensive Report on 98point6 Technologies and its Product</h2>
<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<p>98point6 Technologies, based in Seattle, is a leader in licensed on-demand virtual care software. The company focuses on providing innovative telehealth solutions that enhance patient engagement and improve healthcare delivery. Founded in 2015, 98point6 transitioned from being a virtual primary care provider to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, licensing its technology to healthcare organizations. As of early 2023, the company had raised approximately $300 million in venture capital funding <a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/98point6-buys-bright-md-assets/704661/">(Olsen &amp; Pifer, Healthcare Dive, 2024-01-17)</a>.</p>
<h3>Recent Acquisitions and Partnerships</h3>
<p>On January 16, 2024, 98point6 announced the acquisition of Bright.md's remaining assets, which includes 16 customer contracts and the company's sales and customer success teams. This acquisition is part of 98point6's strategy to enhance its asynchronous care capabilities, allowing healthcare providers to communicate with patients at their convenience <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html">(PR Newswire, 2024-01-16)</a>. The deal was structured as 45% cash and 55% equity, reflecting a strategic move to bolster its product offerings in a competitive market <a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/98point6-buys-bright-md-assets/704661/">(Olsen &amp; Pifer, Healthcare Dive, 2024-01-17)</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, 98point6 has formed a strategic partnership with SteadyMD, combining its cloud-based technology with SteadyMD's network of clinicians to provide a comprehensive virtual care solution. This partnership aims to address the staffing shortages in healthcare and improve operational efficiencies for healthcare organizations <a href="https://www.steadymd.com/blog/98point6-technologies-collaborates-with-steadymd-to-offer-comprehensive-virtual-care-solution-to-healthcare-organizations/">(SteadyMD, 2023-10-09)</a>.</p>
<h3>Product Development</h3>
<p>The flagship product of 98point6 is its Technology Platform, which integrates artificial intelligence and automated clinical support tools to streamline virtual care delivery. The recent launch of an asynchronous care module allows providers to respond to patient inquiries at their convenience, thereby reducing clinician burnout and enhancing patient satisfaction <a href="https://vator.tv/news/2024-01-16-98point6-buys-contracts-from-brightmd-launches-asynchronous-care-module">(Loeb, Vator, 2024-01-16)</a>. The platform is designed to support over 4,000 conditions and includes features such as a clinician console and a patient-facing app, making it a versatile tool for healthcare providers <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html">(PR Newswire, 2024-01-16)</a>.</p>
<h3>Financial Performance and Scale</h3>
<p>As of early 2023, 98point6 had undergone significant restructuring, including the sale of its self-insured employer business to Transcarent for up to $100 million. This pivot allowed the company to focus on its software licensing model, which is expected to drive future growth <a href="https://telecareaware.com/news-roundup-transcarent-raises-126m-98point6-lays-off-oscar-notches-first-profit-steward-healths-ch-11-amazon-clinic-gm-leaves-amwells-down-but-hopeful-q1-hims-founder-gets-political/">(Cusano, Telecare Aware, 2024-01-17)</a>. Despite these changes, the company has faced challenges, including layoffs that reduced its workforce significantly, raising concerns about its operational capacity to support new clients from the Bright.md acquisition <a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/98point6-buys-bright-md-assets/704661/">(Olsen &amp; Pifer, Healthcare Dive, 2024-01-17)</a>.</p>

He stated, "Our mission at 98point6 is to build market-leading technology that empowers healthcare providers with the tools they need to broaden access, enhance patient engagement, and achieve cost savings through greater provider efficiency" <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html">(PR Newswire, 2024-01-16)</a>. This focus on provider enablement is central to the company's strategy as it navigates the evolving healthcare landscape.</p>
<h3>Market Position and Future Outlook</h3>

<h1>Apple App Store Reviews</h1>
<h2>So helpful, 5 stars (Beckyaselby, Apple App Store, 2024-08-15)</h2>
<p>This app was efficient, helpful and easy to use. I am very satisfied with the questions that lead to the diagnosis and care plan.</p>
<h2>Unprofessional app, 1 stars (Hsudgjsjsjsnsi, Apple App Store, 2024-08-14)</h2>
<p>Very poor service if you can go for other app</p>
<h2>Wow., 5 stars (Ms Jacquelyn in AZ, Apple App Store, 2024-08-04)</h2>
<p>So easy. Thank you health insurance company.</p>
<h2>First Time User, 5 stars (Tonyh0ck48, Apple App Store, 2024-07-18)</h2>
<p>I love this app. It was fast easy and perfect without having to wait for an appointment or spend big money on a co-pay for emergency room or urgent care. Only negative clinician didn’t explain in detail the different types ailment in my specific case, so I didn’t understand why I wasn’t getting any medication. but hey, isn’t that why Google was invent and what it’s for! Over all Awesome!</p>
<h2>Dr, 5 stars (Candyleomanh, Apple App Store, 2024-07-13)</h2>
<p>She is always so nice</p>
<h2>Easy going process, 5 stars (420 social butterfly, Apple App Store, 2024-07-12)</h2>
<p>This was a very easy process and minimal wait time! AI takes all the info regarding your issue by answering the questions asked of the patient and submitting any photos to help diagnose? Then you get to speak with the real doctor.. it beats having to wait months to get into see real doctor!</p>
<h2>Lots of questions before talking to a doc, 1 stars (Micky0504, Apple App Store, 2024-07-07)</h2>
<p>It says you’ll be chatting within minutes after answering ‘just a few short questions’ then auto generates what seems like never ending questions. Almost would have been quicker to drive to a Dr. Once you connect to the doc, they ask you some of the same questions or you have to re-explain.</p>
<h2>Great, 5 stars (dhdudidv, Apple App Store, 2024-06-20)</h2>
<p>Very convenient</p>
<h2>Not worth the wait, 1 stars (KellieBurch, Apple App Store, 2024-06-18)</h2>
<p>The “average wait times” are NOT accurate. I’ve used the app a few times and I’ve been told to either buy over the counter meds or go to a doctor.  I thought was the whole point of this app was to keep you out of a doctors office. Last time I tried to use the app, the wait time was less than 2 mins. I waited 45 mins before I closed out the app. Complete waste of time.</p>
<h2>Doctors cannot do anything, 1 stars (Anne bcjsnwndnn, Apple App Store, 2024-06-17)</h2>
<p>Cannot neither diagnose nor monitor existing diagnoses. Was told to go to primary care, a specialist or urgent care. What can these doctors actually do? It isn’t primary care when they tell you to go to primary care.</p>
<h2>WOW!, 5 stars (D_Russ, Apple App Store, 2024-06-17)</h2>
<p>This is the first time I’ve ever used a virtual doctor app and my mind is BLOWN! It was FAST, super detail oriented and they took care of me! No waiting for an appointment, no waiting hours to see a doc… it is 24/7, so I got to text with a doc (which was the best part) at 1am from my couch I highly recommend this to anyone who needs to see a doctor with something that’s not major problem!</p>
<h2>Fine for basic problems, 2 stars (scutwk, Apple App Store, 2024-06-11)</h2>
<p>There is nothing to gain that you can not learn from a simple google symptom search. The clinicians don’t have access to your records, no labs, no imaging. I’m not sure who this is serving.</p>
<h2>Why waste time?, 1 stars (PHXOG, Apple App Store, 2024-06-07)</h2>
<p>I answered a question stating the length of my symptoms on a vital questionnaire. While I went through the process just to be told go to an urgent care because my symptoms did not meet timeline protocol. Chronic sinus infections are common in Arizona.</p>
<h2>Waste of time, 1 stars (Star Cluster, Apple App Store, 2024-06-04)</h2>
<p>Put in my symptoms spoke with a doc and he said go see your primary care doc. Gee thanks for your professional opinion.</p>
<h2>I like it but I wish a voice conversation option was offered, 4 stars (Britt M. F., Apple App Store, 2024-06-03)</h2>
<p>I like it but I wish a voice conversation option was offered.</p>
<h2>Fine, I guess, 3 stars (Sorg12, Apple App Store, 2024-06-01)</h2>
<p>While I appreciate that I can talk to a provider, I HATE that this is a text based platform. A video call would have been quicker. Video would also be a lot easier for a lot of people when they’re not feeling well.</p>
<h2>Overall experience, 5 stars (TJ Skins, Apple App Store, 2024-05-29)</h2>
<p>I called my local doctor this morning hoping to get a telemedicine appointment as I tested positive for Covid &amp; am very sick. I got no call back but my son told me about this app this is now available to me through my current employer. Start to finish took less than 30 minutes including my appointment &amp; prescription being called in. Extremely pleased with the app &amp; doc visit. Thank you!!!!!</p>
<h2>Awesome, 5 stars (huevo702, Apple App Store, 2024-05-23)</h2>

<h2>Late night symptoms., 5 stars (xmasgft2019, Apple App Store, 2024-05-05)</h2>
<p>This was my first time using this app. I have fallen in love. My children always seem to get sick on the weekend or late at night when it’s almost impossible to get to a doctor or Sunday when they are closed. Also they dislike going to the doctor as many children. This was quick easy and painless. Took a total of 30 minutes. I would highly recommend.</p>

<h2>Useless, 1 stars (Jetskid420, Apple App Store, 2024-03-30)</h2>

<h2>Locally can’t get a doctor, 5 stars (TSH49, Apple App Store, 2024-03-30)</h2>
<p>This app has helped me more than once. I live in an area where it takes 6 months to a year to get a doctor if they decide to pick you up as a patient. This app has helped get my medications when I am without a doctor. The doctor I (different every time) have always been helpful, polite, and understanding. Truly a life saver. Thank you!!</p>
<h2>Registered Nurse, 5 stars (LisaACarney, Apple App Store, 2024-03-26)</h2>
<p>A very efficient process! Will use again!</p>
<h2>Appreciate All, 5 stars (rosiesc46, Apple App Store, 2024-03-25)</h2>
<p>I was in a jam with receiving care and the service is so outstanding. Very accurate, quick to help me out. And the Doctor is so helpful and caring. Very Blessed to have the care of Dr. Erin Jones available to me.</p>
<h2>Worst Telehealth service ever, 1 stars (Sunflowergirll, Apple App Store, 2024-03-24)</h2>
<p>This service makes me miss my old insurances Telehealth so much. The service providers always direct you to go be seen in person, they never listen to your past and your history and treat you like a child not an adult, when you know your body. For example as a woman with recurrent UTI’s instead of helping you they make you go see someone in person. I have never experienced this with any other service provider. I have had strep throat and sent pictures in and the provider argued with me that it was not strep and I wouldn’t know and told me to see someone in person. Of course it was. This app is a waste of time, I wish I could get paid to tell someone to go see someone else all day</p>
<h2>Useless, 1 stars (jxbhduufjjdkdkjd, Apple App Store, 2024-03-23)</h2>
<p>Every time I have tried it, I have been advised to go and see a doctor in person. There is a very limited scope for what a virtual doctor can do!</p>
<h2>Love it, 5 stars (Jusnchoooo, Apple App Store, 2024-03-20)</h2>

<h2>Fantastic Experience!, 5 stars (My Kids Mon 09, Apple App Store, 2024-03-16)</h2>
<p>That was very easy, quick, and professional!</p>
<h2>Waste of time, 1 stars (Shane421649, Apple App Store, 2024-03-09)</h2>
<p>Useless service that gives terrible advice for patients whose symptoms are worsening, and they tell you to do what you have been doing for over 3 weeks. Of course this is after they charge you for the non-service.</p>
<h2>Failed in its concept., 1 stars (tuleshed, Apple App Store, 2024-03-02)</h2>
<p>It should’ve been fast and simple, instead it was difficult. The physician wanted clear, black-and-white answers to questions that had a level of subjectiveness. The physician recommended OTC medication that most of us are already familiar with. The NP seemed intent on taking as much time to debate small points that were already articulated to the best of my ability. The other remote doctor service was much better.</p>
<h2>Fast and easy, 5 stars (T Chavoya, Apple App Store, 2024-03-02)</h2>

<h2>Fast and concise care, 5 stars (Nova Reign, Apple App Store, 2024-02-29)</h2>
<p>My visit was fast and convenient! The provider listened to my concerns and addressed my symptoms</p>
<h2>Total waste of time, 1 stars (RFDC22, Apple App Store, 2024-02-28)</h2>
<p>Just see a normal doctor in person. They can examine you and at least attempt to help. Not great when you know more about your medical condition then the clinician you are talking to via a chat and they can’t offer you any assistance.</p>

<h2>First visit, 5 stars (28jeanie, Apple App Store, 2024-02-22)</h2>
<p>I have been sick and missed some work. I needed to be seen by a provider. I tried 98point6 for the first time today! It was fast, friendly and very helpful!</p>
<h2>CANNOT HAVE A VISIT OUTSIDE OF APP, 1 stars (LITAPITA1, Apple App Store, 2024-02-19)</h2>
<p>The app is not functioning on my phone currently and I contacted customer service to see if I could have a phone or web visit and was told that I could not. I have used this service many times and physicians have also called me to conduct a visit, so I am unsure as to why I wouldn’t  be able have an alternative option for a visit. I need my medicines desperately and this is totally ridiculous.</p>
<p>Developer responded by telling me to contact technical service which I already did before I left my feedback. Contacting them was pointless and a waste of time.  I had to make an account just to receive messages from them.</p>

<h2>First visit Clinician didn’t follow up, 4 stars (K1MM1EKAT, Apple App Store, 2024-02-14)</h2>

<h2>Dr visit w/o becoming exposed, 5 stars (Gods Kiddo, Apple App Store, 2024-01-14)</h2>
<p>This is amazing!  Since Covid I have anxiety going to Dr offices and being exposed to so many other patients illnesses.  Being older, I was concerned learning how to use this service.  It was seamless and walked me through each set easily.   Dr was very through with his question and helped me every time .  Thank you for this service.</p>
<h2>Excellent care, 5 stars (Breeon A., Apple App Store, 2024-01-13)</h2>

<h2>Waste of time, 1 stars (dissatisfied_22, Apple App Store, 2024-01-11)</h2>
<p>They don’t actually want to help you and they end up telling you to go to urgent care, for a sinus infection a UTI or anything you bring up to them. These are the things they are supposed to be able to help you with in this application and it’s not happening.</p>
<h2>waste, 1 stars (Dez239, Apple App Store, 2024-01-10)</h2>
<p>don’t bother speaking with a doctor. they will provide you no help and will only send you to an urgent care or hospital. total waste of time!!!!</p>
<h2>Great option to a two hour wait at the Walk-in clinic., 5 stars (Mike’s Uber Reviews, Apple App Store, 2024-01-05)</h2>
<p>I’ve used 98.6 twice now, instead of going to my local walk-in clinic (for minor sinus infection type issues) and the on-line visit has been awesome each time.  The doctors are very nice, and thorough, with their recommendations.  I will use this service first before going to the walk-in, especially so that I don’t have to wait 2 hours in the waiting room.  Both of my visits have been completed in less than 15 minutes.  Thank you so much!</p>
<h2>AMAZING, 5 stars (Sakura Hen, Apple App Store, 2024-01-05)</h2>
<p>I wish I would’ve known this existed a long time ago. the doctor was very nice and didn’t even take that long</p>
<h2>Great experience for first time, 5 stars (rphmom67, Apple App Store, 2024-01-05)</h2>
<p>First time using the Telehealth and it takes a few minutes like filling out information so the doctor can properly treat you.. but the experience was great with the doctor making sure he got the correct information and understanding why I was taking the medication, the correct dosages, to make sure I was doing ok on the medication, to make sure he was sending the refills to the correct pharmacy, and making sure everything was correct before completing the visit.  It was a great experience and I will definitely recommend it to my fellow employees and patients who are able to use it!</p>
<h2>Excellent service with zero wait time!, 5 stars (Stowers2, Apple App Store, 2024-01-03)</h2>
<p>Dr. Nuñez was excellent. So glad the service is available 24/7. Thank you so much.</p>
<h2>Pointless, 1 stars (SiennaArrow, Apple App Store, 2023-12-31)</h2>
<p>This was a complete waste of my time. I have a simple illness that would be remedied by a simple, safe, anti-nausea medication. The ARNP just told me to go find in person care.</p>
<h2>Mr., 5 stars (Shirt off my back., Apple App Store, 2023-12-26)</h2>
<p>Great service physician I was put in touch with was great personable and professional. What a great way to get some quick relief. The walk-in clinic would’ve been a five hour wait.</p>
<h2>Just use webmd, 1 stars (Poopoolovin, Apple App Store, 2023-12-24)</h2>
<p>They don’t ever prescribe anything they just give you a bunch of remedies and tell you to go to urgent care. It’s basically just a waste of time. Go to webmd and get the exact same info.</p>
<h2>Quick and helpful!, 5 stars (Missymady97, Apple App Store, 2023-12-23)</h2>
<p>I was seen quickly, it was very easy to complete the pre screening questions. So much better than leaving my home to be exposed to different illnesses at an urgent care. The physician was also extremely helpful and quick to respond. Definitely will be using this in the future!</p>
<h2>Poor customer service, 1 stars (Jdubz8910, Apple App Store, 2023-12-23)</h2>
<p>You have no email address for customer satisfaction. It is evident that this service lacks a customer-centric approach, as there are no available options to express concerns or provide feedback. This lack of consideration for customer satisfaction is disappointing and raises questions about the service's commitment to improving and addressing customer needs. I hope that you will take this feedback into consideration and implements a system that allows customers to express their concerns and provide feedback in the future.</p>
<p>Over the past week, my children have been home sick from school, and we have been cautious about having any visitors. Unfortunately, I have been experiencing symptoms that lead me to suspect I may have contracted strep throat, although I cannot be entirely certain. In an attempt to seek medical advice conveniently, I decided to utilize the 98.6 app, a service provided by our employer. Previously, we had been using Teldoc for the past 20 years, but our employer recently switched to 98.6, which has proven to be an inconvenience and a waste of time, with no added convenience.</p>
<p>During my recent interaction with the 98.6 app, I had the opportunity to consult with the FNP-BC, a Nurse Practitioner based in New York, NY. As a provider responsible for handling calls from subscribed employees, it is crucial that her professionalism and respect reflect the value of the service that employers pay for. The purpose of this service is to provide employees with prompt and convenient care, and it is essential that her behavior aligns with this objective.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my experience with Nurse  was far from satisfactory. After expressing a differing opinion, she abruptly terminated the visit, displaying a lack of professionalism and cowardice. It is concerning to think that someone with such behavior is responsible for caring for patients. I strongly urge you to review her patient transcripts for overall patient satisfaction and consider the impact her actions may have on the reputation of the service.</p>
<h2>Spam Central, 1 stars (delete spammer apps, Apple App Store, 2023-12-20)</h2>
<p>Prior to installing this app I never received spam calls.  Now I get 40 - 50 spam calls a day.  I am not an app hound installing every spyware app out there.  I have the basic app load from apple, so this app is apparently the culprit for this 3 year old phone.</p>
<h2>Another worthless app, 1 stars (tipaz, Apple App Store, 2023-12-17)</h2>
<p>Will only offer general OTC recommendations and give no real help. Better to just spend your co-pay at urgent care.</p>
<h2>If you just want sympathy this is for you, 1 stars (Danscott251973, Apple App Store, 2023-12-15)</h2>
<p>Both my wife and I have tried this app and the result is the same. You have to answer a ton of questions then you get a warning that they rarely give prescriptions which turned out to be true. </p>
<p>Basically the doctor gives you the “I’m sorry you feel bad. Just wait it out.” I get that some Doctors just hand out prescriptions to everyone and they certainly don’t want to be the online pharmacy, but with the warning before you even meet the Dr you get a sense they’ll take your insurance company’s money, but not any risk to actually treat someone.</p>
<p>The advantage to the Doctors is that they never get a personal review because the Doctor who will diagnose you will be chosen by the app.</p>
<p>Anyway if you want a Doctor’s sympathy this is the app for you.</p>
<h2>The absolute worst app, 1 stars (Emerald6991, Apple App Store, 2023-12-10)</h2>
<p>Everything is viral. After showing I tested negative for Covid and the flu they say my sore throat is caused by a viral infection and antibiotics won’t work. I’m so over this app. Every time I come on here the day go into urgent care. Just useless doctors.</p>
<h2>Commit uninterrupted time at least 30 minutes for your first time, 1 stars (Frustrated 1st attempt, Apple App Store, 2023-12-08)</h2>
<p>After 30 or 40 minutes of entering, my Short, medical history and answering questions the doctor finally came on. I had to get into my car and then they said I took too long and it timed out after 40 minutes of dealing with it.</p>

<h2>Can’t enroll, 1 stars (JollyGreenWV, Apple App Store, 2023-12-07)</h2>
<p>My son is listed as a dependent on my insurance card as per my insurance provider. Yet, he cannot enroll. He is denied eligibility after giving the last 4 of his social. There seems to be no way of contacting the developers to fix this issue.</p>
<h2>Total WASTE OF TIME, 1 stars (Stupidity should be a felony, Apple App Store, 2023-12-04)</h2>
<p>Go though a boatload of questions, all the medication and other medical record but before they can actually DO anything they require a “quick” video call. Despite giving all necessary permission, they couldn’t get my video or audio TOTAL WASTE OF TIME</p>
<p>There is no need to do anything else. The experience was so awful that I just have no desire to use the app and underlying “service.”  My review stands!</p>
<h2>Useless, 1 stars (Jesus I can't find a nick name, Apple App Store, 2023-12-04)</h2>
<p>Every time I’m in need of a prescription they say go to an Urgent Care they never prescribe anything. The point of this app is to not need to go to the Urgent care centers and get my prescription. It’s like if I wanted to order shoes online and the website says to go to the actual store to get them. Not exactly but same concept it seems like. I don’t know why my company pays these people.</p>
<h2>Not helpful, 1 stars (p;4, Apple App Store, 2023-11-27)</h2>
<p>Providers admit that they are limited in what they can do in the virtual environment and, after a long process and wait time, just refer you out to an in person provider. Skip this process and just go to the in person provider. This does not save you any time or energy.</p>
<h2>Treatment Pink Eye, 5 stars (Rjazen, Apple App Store, 2023-11-26)</h2>
<p>This was way easier and much more efficient than me visiting a doc in person. The questions asked and provider assigned allowed us to complete the visit quickly and efficiently. He was able to call in an Rx during the visit and it saved me from waiting 2 hours in immediate care.</p>

<p>You get what you pay for.This was free from my employer so I tried to get medicine for pink eye for my son  and they denied it saying it was “viral” and didn’t need treatment. I went to the real doctor the next morning and had a script within 30 minutes. I’m deleting this app.</p>
<h2>No care for patients, 1 stars (Squirrel in the sky, Apple App Store, 2023-11-12)</h2>
<p>I understand with antibiotics the doctors follow strict guidelines, however it’s really interesting when a doctor sends you the guidelines to explain why he won’t give antibiotics for a sinus infection to a person with a weakened immune system for 10 day even though according to the guidelines in my situation it says 3-4 days and it’s been 3. This is after the first doctor brushed me off as a cold. Every time I use this app I’m directed to urgent care, what’s the point of even using it then?</p>

<p>Because I was honest in my history questions and mentioned I am in remission with CLL  he was unwilling to give me an RX for a simple bladder infection without a culture. I can’t get a culture on a weekend and I work Monday through Friday in a hospital. I was desperately trying to get help on a Saturday so that I can work on Monday. 
It honestly makes me wish I did not give an honest history. Next time I won’t.</p>

<h2>Greatly appreciated, 5 stars (Mrs.B@2022, Apple App Store, 2023-09-23)</h2>
<p>I have tried all day to get my 6 year old son seen today. I could not get him In yesterday and with it being a Saturday today the only places near me where Urgent Cares which we’re wanting $100 upfront even with insurance. I felt defeated because I did not have the money at the time. I saw my insurance offered this app at $0 cost so I tried it. I’m so glad I did it was super quick and easy to use. We had a short video chat but most of it was by text. The doctor was very nice and helpful. She sent in a lot of useful information. He was diagnosed and sent in a prescription to the pharmacy of my choosing. Now my son can get better thanks to this app and the very appreciated doctors. </p>
<p>It is a great app to use for adults and parents that are unable to drive or that just is having a hard time being seen by someone same day. The have doctors available every day of the week on this app. I’m so lucky to have used it. Thank you 98point6!</p>

<h2>First time using. Useless., 1 stars (Florida Mom3, Apple App Store, 2023-08-22)</h2>
<p>Not impressed. Gave us suggestion for ibuprofen, throat lozenges and warm liquids. No kidding. Been doing that for 3 days and told them that. Their suggestion is go in if we want more. Thought that’s what we dialed in for.</p>
<h2>Great first visit, 5 stars (Great first visit, Apple App Store, 2023-08-15)</h2>
<p>Dr Balauag, Marlon was very thorough and polite. He ensured that my concerns were addressed. He made this first time use of this app very positive.</p>
<h2>1st visit, 1 stars (Not satisfied 65, Apple App Store, 2023-08-13)</h2>
<p>Felt like the doctor could have been more understanding of my history with the condition that I presented her, I have a history of the condition but she had to follow “protocol “ and basically couldn’t help me with something as simple as tonsillitis, I’ve experienced it since childhood and am well aware of what is going on I even  sent a photo clearly showing swollen glands and spots and still was of no help. I will not use this service again, I could only imagine if it was something more serious it would be a waste of time just like this was. Just another way for the insurance to get charged for a additional visit if you ask me…</p>

<h2>1 stars (JT fromSuckerpunch, Google Play Store, 2024-08-08)</h2>
<p>Two separate visits, both for rather innocuous assistance, and both times I'm told to seek care from a PCP. Entire point of app is to not seek care from a PCP. Useless, would not recommend to anyone.</p>
<h2>1 stars (Melissa Bowen, Google Play Store, 2024-08-07)</h2>
<p>Please know they will wait for months after your visit to charge you without sending you any email or text about it. They charged my card today for a visit that was 6 months ago!</p>
<h2>2 stars (Christiana Cook, Google Play Store, 2024-08-01)</h2>
<p>Pretty frustrating app kept saying not working but would go to the next question spent about 15mins completely the questions, to be Interupted by a doctor saying I was idle for too long and booting me to start all over again.</p>

<p>Doctors don't care. But if you're looking for a super easy doctors note to get out of work or you will be tardy use this app. Mind you your mychart now has virtual urgent care and you actually video chat with a doctor on mychart virtual urgent care. 98point6 they only text you. They won't back track a doctors note for you. But mychart will gladly write your note to be excused for the day before especially if you can't make it in the day you are actually sick and can only visit the next day</p>
<h2>2 stars (Vivien Limeña, Google Play Store, 2024-07-10)</h2>
<p>Lately I can't seem to get past waiting for a code. I keep trying to get in to get a prescription filled but as soon as I open the app it requests I enter my phone number to request a code which never comes. I've checked and rechecked my number or blocked numbers on my phone and I still can't get past this screen. This is EXTREMELY frustrating!</p>
<h2>1 stars (Brian Lemley, Google Play Store, 2024-07-07)</h2>
<p>The doctors on here are quacks. I would not use this app. I thought the purpose of this was to avoid the hospital or clinics. I came on here to try and get antibiotics. Was told to go to a clinic. I came on here so I wouldn't have to go to a clinic. You won't get anything but the run around with these doctors, so save your self time and go to a clinic and avoid these quacks</p>
<h2>5 stars (Anita Derbin, Google Play Store, 2024-06-18)</h2>
<p>I am so grateful my husband's job offers this as a benefit. We have two little kids who, as well known, tend to get sick pretty often. On our area, it is nearly impossible to get the same day appointment with the doctor. Plus, daycare requires doctors note if we wanted to get a partial refund on the tuition for missing days - this app allows us (at no cost since it is offered as a benefit) from the comfort of our home get in touch with a doctor at any time of the day. GOD SENT! ❤️</p>

<p>Had an issue with a bump that was g r ow ing on my cheek &amp; didn't know what the hell it was! So, I tried this app and got nowhere! The virtual assistant didn't understand any of my questions 9th¹1&amp; also ended my session while I was describing my problem, causing me to have to start the intake registration over! Then, I get to the video call with a doctor but, she said she couldn't see it clear enough to make a diagnosis and ended the session! &amp; I still got charged the co-pay for the video visit</p>

<p>What is the purpose of paying a copay to use this app if they are not going to help you. I have tried to use this service 3 different times for health issues and all they do is collect my copay and suggest I go to a Dr in person. They will not prescribe antibiotics ever. Waste of money.</p>

<h2>2 stars (Scott Keller, Google Play Store, 2023-08-12)</h2>
<p>The first step is to verify your mobile number by entering a code that is texted to you. There is no other option. You're lucky if you get the code within five minutes core before it expires. This is common. Then you get into a queue after an idiotic chatbot asks you a bunch of redundant questions and you wait a long time. While you go about your life waiting for the doc, if you don't respond very quickly to the doc when they're ready, your session ends and is lost forever and you start over ag</p>

<p>What good is a service built to help people with health needs who's schedule prevents conventional options if it's so glitchy it crashes utterly and causes you to miss appointments that take weeks to reschedule. If you require help in any degree of time sensitivity, try something else.</p>

<h2>1 stars (Nun'ya, Google Play Store, 2023-04-21)</h2>
<p>APP works but doctors are listed but NOT necessarily local. Had poisoning from AZ plant, got a NY dr or nurse practitioner, not sure. Had no idea what my issue was. No results only a wasted text/time. 1 min video and texting the rest of the "visit". Not sure this is real medical care. It's text care??!!?? Not impressed at all. At least it was 0$ as it wasn't worth a penny. Sorry. Lame telemedicine. But app works. Asks huge amt of questions and took 2 weeks to be registered correctly. Pftt!</p>

<h2>1 stars (Charyl DeAlva, Google Play Store, 2023-03-03)</h2>
<p>Love the experience. 1st time using it. 10/20 update. I was sick and contacted 98 point 6 had fever aore throat etc. Was told to call back on 10 days of not better. Then they would issue a perscription. This service was pointless. The entire point of this service is to keep sick people home and out of office. She even told me to go to urgent care. Why when she clearly could have issued the antibiotic that was needed. Great concept poor service</p>
<h2>5 stars (knot tday, Google Play Store, 2023-02-28)</h2>
<p>This is by far the best medical care I have ever received in years. It's a sad day when you can only get a doctor to see you on an app. But this is awesome!</p>
<h2>1 stars (Chad Janosik, Google Play Store, 2023-02-09)</h2>
<p>Waste of time and money. I have used other telehealth services in the past that were helpful. This one is NOT. My insurance coverage covers for this app and I am sad they choose this company instead of the previous telehealth services. Had my appointment at urgent care and was in/out faster than seeing a doctor in this app. Urgent care got me what I needed. I talked to 12 other employees that tried this app only one person had a decent experience.Honestly Google is FREE and you get the same info</p>
<h2>1 stars (Phillip Roberts, Google Play Store, 2023-02-07)</h2>

<h2>5 stars (Patty Stulc, Google Play Store, 2023-01-24)</h2>
<p>We have used this app twice. They triage appropriately so some waits are longer when they are busy. Fortunately, they send a notification when the provider is available so you can go about your day. The triage questions are appropriare and we were in contact with the providers fairly quickly with efficient evaluations. I will definitely use the service again.</p>

<p>This service USED to be good, they would actually help and prescribe medications. This past year, every technician has said "go see a doctor" and all seem to use the same quick response prompts. Don't waste your money. It's definitely not worth it.</p>

<p>Don't waist your time or money just to be told to go to a clinic in the morning or how to drink warm tea for a sore throat. TeleDoc and other teleservices have 0 issue prescribing medication for common and obvious ailments like sore throat saving you valuable time and money. You won't find this here.</p>
<h2>3 stars (Jace Ram, Google Play Store, 2022-09-09)</h2>
<p>The app itself functions great but the service seems intended for extremely mild/minor issues. From the two times I've used the service, both times I was directed to urgent care or the ER. It seems, based on my experience, the physicians are very cautious in providing any diagnosis via telehealth. I get it, but then what's the point of the service if the best plan is always seeking in-person care?</p>
<h2>2 stars (OnlyMrsHampton, Google Play Store, 2022-08-30)</h2>
<p>I've been waiting for a physician about 30 minutes, I step away to get something to drink, they will appear! They have my phone # and email. You'd think they'd try and contact me back right...... WRONG! We all value our time! If I stepped away and they see my chat still open, seems like common sense or common courtesy will kick in and say I'll give her a few minutes then try and make contact. Not! Now I got to go thru the process and explanation again! Not cool, that sucks 😔</p>

Then I waited another hour to see the same doctor and I picked up the call and there was no response. She said she couldn't get it to work so she ended the visit.

Misunderstanding and misdiagnosis of the real problems has been my experience. Heart attack? No, it tells me, it's just stress. Looking for a mental health therapist?
