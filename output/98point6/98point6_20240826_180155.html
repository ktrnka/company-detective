        <h1>About 98point6</h1>
<p>98point6 is a digital healthcare company founded on March 1, 2015, and headquartered in Seattle, Washington <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/98point6">(Crunchbase, 2024)</a>. The company offers a text-based virtual care service that provides personalized consultation, diagnosis, and treatment to patients through a mobile app. The service is available 24/7 and aims to make healthcare more accessible and affordable by leveraging technology and board-certified physicians.</p>
<p>The company initially operated as a virtual primary care provider but pivoted to focus on licensing its telehealth software to healthcare providers. This strategic shift was solidified with the acquisition of its virtual care business by Transcarent in March 2023 for up to $100 million <a href="https://tracxn.com/d/companies/98point6/__CXnfm7ynYYw-600ITK_cfsQpnzQZ5EyDffQDrYygmW0">(Tracxn, 2021)</a>.

<p>98point6 generates revenue through a subscription model, offering unlimited virtual visits for a fixed annual fee.

<h1>Apple App Store Reviews</h1>
<h2>Waste of time, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11644902144">(baba coo coo, Apple App Store, 2024-08-23)</a></h2>
<p>Dr assumed I have viral infection so she would not prescribe  anything.  I have a painful eye infection and a swollen face and she decided  it was a cold.  No antibiotic or steroid.  How do you assume someone has a virus infection vs bacterial based on the intake questions and no culture.  If your guidelines don’t allow these prescribers to prescribe medication why not explain  that up front .   Total waste of time .</p>
<h2>So helpful, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11612903769">(Beckyaselby, Apple App Store, 2024-08-15)</a></h2>
<p>This app was efficient, helpful and easy to use. I am very satisfied with the questions that lead to the diagnosis and care plan.</p>
<h2>Unprofessional app, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11611395650">(Hsudgjsjsjsnsi, Apple App Store, 2024-08-14)</a></h2>
<p>Very poor service if you can go for other app</p>
<h2>Wow., 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11573413962">(Ms Jacquelyn in AZ, Apple App Store, 2024-08-04)</a></h2>
<p>So easy. Thank you health insurance company.</p>
<h2>First Time User, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11508226229">(Tonyh0ck48, Apple App Store, 2024-07-18)</a></h2>
<p>I love this app. It was fast easy and perfect without having to wait for an appointment or spend big money on a co-pay for emergency room or urgent care. Only negative clinician didn’t explain in detail the different types ailment in my specific case, so I didn’t understand why I wasn’t getting any medication. but hey, isn’t that why Google was invent and what it’s for! Over all Awesome!</p>
<h2>Dr, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11488930939">(Candyleomanh, Apple App Store, 2024-07-13)</a></h2>
<p>She is always so nice</p>
<h2>Easy going process, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11485591903">(420 social butterfly, Apple App Store, 2024-07-12)</a></h2>
<p>This was a very easy process and minimal wait time! AI takes all the info regarding your issue by answering the questions asked of the patient and submitting any photos to help diagnose? Then you get to speak with the real doctor.. it beats having to wait months to get into see real doctor!</p>
<h2>Lots of questions before talking to a doc, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11466860060">(Micky0504, Apple App Store, 2024-07-07)</a></h2>
<p>It says you’ll be chatting within minutes after answering ‘just a few short questions’ then auto generates what seems like never ending questions. Almost would have been quicker to drive to a Dr. Once you connect to the doc, they ask you some of the same questions or you have to re-explain.</p>
<h2>Great, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11404738505">(dhdudidv, Apple App Store, 2024-06-20)</a></h2>
<p>Very convenient</p>
<h2>Not worth the wait, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11394705975">(KellieBurch, Apple App Store, 2024-06-18)</a></h2>
<p>The “average wait times” are NOT accurate. I’ve used the app a few times and I’ve been told to either buy over the counter meds or go to a doctor.  I thought was the whole point of this app was to keep you out of a doctors office. Last time I tried to use the app, the wait time was less than 2 mins. I waited 45 mins before I closed out the app. Complete waste of time.</p>
<h2>Doctors cannot do anything, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11393087784">(Anne bcjsnwndnn, Apple App Store, 2024-06-17)</a></h2>
<p>Cannot neither diagnose nor monitor existing diagnoses. Was told to go to primary care, a specialist or urgent care. What can these doctors actually do? It isn’t primary care when they tell you to go to primary care.</p>
<h2>WOW!, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11390454013">(D_Russ, Apple App Store, 2024-06-17)</a></h2>
<p>This is the first time I’ve ever used a virtual doctor app and my mind is BLOWN! It was FAST, super detail oriented and they took care of me! No waiting for an appointment, no waiting hours to see a doc… it is 24/7, so I got to text with a doc (which was the best part) at 1am from my couch I highly recommend this to anyone who needs to see a doctor with something that’s not major problem!</p>
<h2>Fine for basic problems, 2 stars <a href="https://apple/11370624806">(scutwk, Apple App Store, 2024-06-11)</a></h2>
<p>There is nothing to gain that you can not learn from a simple google symptom search. The clinicians don’t have access to your records, no labs, no imaging. I’m not sure who this is serving.</p>
<h2>Why waste time?, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11355774107">(PHXOG, Apple App Store, 2024-06-07)</a></h2>
<p>I answered a question stating the length of my symptoms on a vital questionnaire. While I went through the process just to be told go to an urgent care because my symptoms did not meet timeline protocol. Chronic sinus infections are common in Arizona.</p>
<h2>Waste of time, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11343933139">(Star Cluster, Apple App Store, 2024-06-04)</a></h2>
<p>Put in my symptoms spoke with a doc and he said go see your primary care doc. Gee thanks for your professional opinion.</p>
<h2>I like it but I wish a voice conversation option was offered, 4 stars <a href="https://apple/11340711057">(Britt M. F., Apple App Store, 2024-06-03)</a></h2>
<p>I like it but I wish a voice conversation option was offered.</p>
<h2>Fine, I guess, 3 stars <a href="https://apple/11333205037">(Sorg12, Apple App Store, 2024-06-01)</a></h2>
<p>While I appreciate that I can talk to a provider, I HATE that this is a text based platform. A video call would have been quicker. Video would also be a lot easier for a lot of people when they’re not feeling well.</p>
<h2>Overall experience, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11321372318">(TJ Skins, Apple App Store, 2024-05-29)</a></h2>
<p>I called my local doctor this morning hoping to get a telemedicine appointment as I tested positive for Covid &amp; am very sick. I got no call back but my son told me about this app this is now available to me through my current employer. Start to finish took less than 30 minutes including my appointment &amp; prescription being called in. Extremely pleased with the app &amp; doc visit. Thank you!!!!!</p>
<h2>Awesome, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11300537519">(huevo702, Apple App Store, 2024-05-23)</a></h2>
<p>It was pretty quick , doctor gave me a prescription simple</p>
<h2>Feels like a scam, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11295221610">(Will_Munny, Apple App Store, 2024-05-22)</a></h2>
<p>Never prescribe you anything. Garbage.</p>
<h2>Incredibly easy to use, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11284764264">(Schwety, Apple App Store, 2024-05-19)</a></h2>
<p>Download, install, setup, start, connect with nurse, and finish all within 10 minutes? This app is incredible!</p>
<h2>Just don’t!, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11277295150">(KrisHerod, Apple App Store, 2024-05-17)</a></h2>
<p>Just go to a real urgent care and don’t waste your time.</p>
<h2>Quick and convenient!, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11243250206">(Cburr13, Apple App Store, 2024-05-07)</a></h2>
<p>Quick, convenient, and very helpful!</p>
<h2>Great system., 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11239050605">(AP AZ learner, Apple App Store, 2024-05-06)</a></h2>
<p>App works well.  Efficient and easy.</p>
<h2>Late night symptoms., 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11234111876">(xmasgft2019, Apple App Store, 2024-05-05)</a></h2>
<p>This was my first time using this app. I have fallen in love. My children always seem to get sick on the weekend or late at night when it’s almost impossible to get to a doctor or Sunday when they are closed. Also they dislike going to the doctor as many children. This was quick easy and painless. Took a total of 30 minutes. I would highly recommend.</p>
<h2>Wait times wrong, 3 stars <a href="https://apple/11233151948">(Eyegirl 1, Apple App Store, 2024-05-04)</a></h2>
<p>Waited 1 hr after being told 6 million minutes</p>
<h2>Seamless and Easy, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11213846923">(JessicaG04, Apple App Store, 2024-04-29)</a></h2>
<p>Set up the app and my account with in minutes. The app walks you through the process and even does the insurance verification for you! Was super easy requesting a visit and SAME day. Spoke to a licensed clinician in less than 10 minutes after setting up app.</p>
<h2>Horrible healthcare experience, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11156179082">(Worst healthcare professionals, Apple App Store, 2024-04-13)</a></h2>
<p>They are the worst healthcare providers don't even listen to you and not even try to help worst experience.</p>
<h2>Scary AI doctor, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11145778360">(Potterypillow, Apple App Store, 2024-04-11)</a></h2>
<p>I never saw a real person and they just copied information from Web MD to answer questions with no real solutions</p>
<h2>So incredibly helpful and efficient!, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11127116484">(Cbull8, Apple App Store, 2024-04-06)</a></h2>
<p>This service is amazing! It has really helped me and my family get the care we need quickly.</p>
<h2>Caring and professional providers, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11106557877">(Captain Sparkles 36, Apple App Store, 2024-03-31)</a></h2>
<p>Got a quick call back for an UTI over the weekend. Thank you</p>
<h2>Useless, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11103850746">(Jetskid420, Apple App Store, 2024-03-30)</a></h2>
<p>Can't renew subscription without a sponsor? What's the point of this app</p>
<h2>Locally can’t get a doctor, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11103335926">(TSH49, Apple App Store, 2024-03-30)</a></h2>
<p>This app has helped me more than once. I live in an area where it takes 6 months to a year to get a doctor if they decide to pick you up as a patient. This app has helped get my medications when I am without a doctor. The doctor I (different every time) have always been helpful, polite, and understanding. Truly a life saver. Thank you!!</p>
<h2>Registered Nurse, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11088597158">(LisaACarney, Apple App Store, 2024-03-26)</a></h2>
<p>A very efficient process! Will use again!</p>
<h2>Appreciate All, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11084561887">(rosiesc46, Apple App Store, 2024-03-25)</a></h2>
<p>I was in a jam with receiving care and the service is so outstanding. Very accurate, quick to help me out. And the Doctor is so helpful and caring. Very Blessed to have the care of Dr. Erin Jones available to me.</p>
<h2>Worst Telehealth service ever, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11081010289">(Sunflowergirll, Apple App Store, 2024-03-24)</a></h2>
<p>This service makes me miss my old insurances Telehealth so much. The service providers always direct you to go be seen in person, they never listen to your past and your history and treat you like a child not an adult, when you know your body. For example as a woman with recurrent UTI’s instead of helping you they make you go see someone in person. I have never experienced this with any other service provider. I have had strep throat and sent pictures in and the provider argued with me that it was not strep and I wouldn’t know and told me to see someone in person. Of course it was. This app is a waste of time, I wish I could get paid to tell someone to go see someone else all day</p>
<h2>Useless, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11077035493">(jxbhduufjjdkdkjd, Apple App Store, 2024-03-23)</a></h2>
<p>Every time I have tried it, I have been advised to go and see a doctor in person. There is a very limited scope for what a virtual doctor can do!</p>
<h2>Love it, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11065207384">(Jusnchoooo, Apple App Store, 2024-03-20)</a></h2>
<p>I love it. It was so easy to navigate and fast to respond.</p>
<h2>Complete waste of time as always., 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11059024947">(Deerslayer2311, Apple App Store, 2024-03-18)</a></h2>
<p>All the do is tell you to go to the doctor lol.</p>
<h2>Fantastic Experience!, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11051154464">(My Kids Mon 09, Apple App Store, 2024-03-16)</a></h2>
<p>That was very easy, quick, and professional!</p>
<h2>Waste of time, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11026946397">(Shane421649, Apple App Store, 2024-03-09)</a></h2>
<p>Useless service that gives terrible advice for patients whose symptoms are worsening, and they tell you to do what you have been doing for over 3 weeks. Of course this is after they charge you for the non-service.</p>
<h2>Failed in its concept., 1 stars <a href="https://apple/11001094000">(tuleshed, Apple App Store, 2024-03-02)</a></h2>
<p>It should’ve been fast and simple, instead it was difficult. The physician wanted clear, black-and-white answers to questions that had a level of subjectiveness. The physician recommended OTC medication that most of us are already familiar with. The NP seemed intent on taking as much time to debate small points that were already articulated to the best of my ability. The other remote doctor service was much better.</p>
<h2>Fast and easy, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/11000365951">(T Chavoya, Apple App Store, 2024-03-02)</a></h2>
<p>This was a great experience. Very fast, very easy.</p>
<h2>A waste of time, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/10996928895">(tfmika89, Apple App Store, 2024-03-01)</a></h2>
<p>A waste of time nothing was resolved</p>
<h2>Fast and concise care, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/10992771039">(Nova Reign, Apple App Store, 2024-02-29)</a></h2>
<p>My visit was fast and convenient! The provider listened to my concerns and addressed my symptoms</p>
<h2>Total waste of time, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/10989851842">(RFDC22, Apple App Store, 2024-02-28)</a></h2>
<p>Just see a normal doctor in person. They can examine you and at least attempt to help. Not great when you know more about your medical condition then the clinician you are talking to via a chat and they can’t offer you any assistance.</p>
<h2>No help i got, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/10982482027">(Karenheba, Apple App Store, 2024-02-26)</a></h2>

<h2>They canceled my appointment because “My symptoms were too serious “, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/10981213040">(J. Dreadful, Apple App Store, 2024-02-26)</a></h2>
<p>No option for help elsewhere. No helpful phone numbers, just canceled. Guess a patient as hopeless as me really is all alone</p>
<h2>First visit, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/10968329542">(28jeanie, Apple App Store, 2024-02-22)</a></h2>
<p>I have been sick and missed some work. I needed to be seen by a provider. I tried 98point6 for the first time today! It was fast, friendly and very helpful!</p>
<h2>CANNOT HAVE A VISIT OUTSIDE OF APP, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/10958530506">(LITAPITA1, Apple App Store, 2024-02-19)</a></h2>
<p>The app is not functioning on my phone currently and I contacted customer service to see if I could have a phone or web visit and was told that I could not. I have used this service many times and physicians have also called me to conduct a visit, so I am unsure as to why I wouldn’t  be able have an alternative option for a visit. I need my medicines desperately and this is totally ridiculous.</p>
<p>Developer responded by telling me to contact technical service which I already did before I left my feedback. Contacting them was pointless and a waste of time.  I had to make an account just to receive messages from them.</p>
<h2>Mic icon is troubling, 3 stars <a href="https://apple/10949554376">(ja in ny, Apple App Store, 2024-02-17)</a></h2>
<p>Mic icon is green when OFF. Shouldn’t green mean go/on? Cost time for the rep and myself</p>

<p>My first experience was good, except the clinician didn’t follow up as he said he would. I ended up having to follow up thru the app and spoke to another clinician.</p>

<h2>Dr visit w/o becoming exposed, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/10821962384">(Gods Kiddo, Apple App Store, 2024-01-14)</a></h2>
<p>This is amazing!  Since Covid I have anxiety going to Dr offices and being exposed to so many other patients illnesses.  Being older, I was concerned learning how to use this service.  It was seamless and walked me through each set easily.   Dr was very through with his question and helped me every time .  Thank you for this service.</p>

<p>They don’t actually want to help you and they end up telling you to go to urgent care, for a sinus infection a UTI or anything you bring up to them. These are the things they are supposed to be able to help you with in this application and it’s not happening.</p>

<p>don’t bother speaking with a doctor. they will provide you no help and will only send you to an urgent care or hospital. total waste of time!!!!</p>
<h2>Great option to a two hour wait at the Walk-in clinic., 5 stars <a href="https://apple/10788420459">(Mike’s Uber Reviews, Apple App Store, 2024-01-05)</a></h2>
<p>I’ve used 98.6 twice now, instead of going to my local walk-in clinic (for minor sinus infection type issues) and the on-line visit has been awesome each time.  The doctors are very nice, and thorough, with their recommendations.  I will use this service first before going to the walk-in, especially so that I don’t have to wait 2 hours in the waiting room.  Both of my visits have been completed in less than 15 minutes.  Thank you so much!</p>
<h2>AMAZING, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/10787859601">(Sakura Hen, Apple App Store, 2024-01-05)</a></h2>
<p>I wish I would’ve known this existed a long time ago. the doctor was very nice and didn’t even take that long</p>
<h2>Great experience for first time, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/10787491208">(rphmom67, Apple App Store, 2024-01-05)</a></h2>
<p>First time using the Telehealth and it takes a few minutes like filling out information so the doctor can properly treat you.. but the experience was great with the doctor making sure he got the correct information and understanding why I was taking the medication, the correct dosages, to make sure I was doing ok on the medication, to make sure he was sending the refills to the correct pharmacy, and making sure everything was correct before completing the visit.  It was a great experience and I will definitely recommend it to my fellow employees and patients who are able to use it!</p>

<p>Dr. Nuñez was excellent. So glad the service is available 24/7. Thank you so much.</p>
<h2>Pointless, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/10767775702">(SiennaArrow, Apple App Store, 2023-12-31)</a></h2>
<p>This was a complete waste of my time. I have a simple illness that would be remedied by a simple, safe, anti-nausea medication. The ARNP just told me to go find in person care.</p>

<p>Great service physician I was put in touch with was great personable and professional. What a great way to get some quick relief. The walk-in clinic would’ve been a five hour wait.</p>
<h2>Just use webmd, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/10739754735">(Poopoolovin, Apple App Store, 2023-12-24)</a></h2>
<p>They don’t ever prescribe anything they just give you a bunch of remedies and tell you to go to urgent care. It’s basically just a waste of time. Go to webmd and get the exact same info.</p>
<h2>Quick and helpful!, 5 stars <a href="https://apple/10736209622">(Missymady97, Apple App Store, 2023-12-23)</a></h2>
<p>I was seen quickly, it was very easy to complete the pre screening questions. So much better than leaving my home to be exposed to different illnesses at an urgent care. The physician was also extremely helpful and quick to respond. Definitely will be using this in the future!</p>
<h2>Poor customer service, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/10735124104">(Jdubz8910, Apple App Store, 2023-12-23)</a></h2>
<p>You have no email address for customer satisfaction. It is evident that this service lacks a customer-centric approach, as there are no available options to express concerns or provide feedback. This lack of consideration for customer satisfaction is disappointing and raises questions about the service's commitment to improving and addressing customer needs.

<p>Over the past week, my children have been home sick from school, and we have been cautious about having any visitors. Unfortunately, I have been experiencing symptoms that lead me to suspect I may have contracted strep throat, although I cannot be entirely certain. In an attempt to seek medical advice conveniently, I decided to utilize the 98.6 app, a service provided by our employer. Previously, we had been using Teldoc for the past 20 years, but our employer recently switched to 98.6, which has proven to be an inconvenience and a waste of time, with no added convenience.</p>
<p>During my recent interaction with the 98.6 app, I had the opportunity to consult with the FNP-BC, a Nurse Practitioner based in New York, NY. As a provider responsible for handling calls from subscribed employees, it is crucial that her professionalism and respect reflect the value of the service that employers pay for. The purpose of this service is to provide employees with prompt and convenient care, and it is essential that her behavior aligns with this objective.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my experience with Nurse  was far from satisfactory. After expressing a differing opinion, she abruptly terminated the visit, displaying a lack of professionalism and cowardice. It is concerning to think that someone with such behavior is responsible for caring for patients. I strongly urge you to review her patient transcripts for overall patient satisfaction and consider the impact her actions may have on the reputation of the service.</p>

<p>Prior to installing this app I never received spam calls.  Now I get 40 - 50 spam calls a day.  I am not an app hound installing every spyware app out there.  I have the basic app load from apple, so this app is apparently the culprit for this 3 year old phone.</p>

<h2>If you just want sympathy this is for you, 1 stars <a href="https://apple/10697551795">(Danscott251973, Apple App Store, 2023-12-15)</a></h2>
<p>Both my wife and I have tried this app and the result is the same. You have to answer a ton of questions then you get a warning that they rarely give prescriptions which turned out to be true. </p>
<p>Basically the doctor gives you the “I’m sorry you feel bad. Just wait it out.” I get that some Doctors just hand out prescriptions to everyone and they certainly don’t want to be the online pharmacy, but with the warning before you even meet the Dr you get a sense they’ll take your insurance company’s money, but not any risk to actually treat someone.</p>
<p>The advantage to the Doctors is that they never get a personal review because the Doctor who will diagnose you will be chosen by the app.</p>
<p>Anyway if you want a Doctor’s sympathy this is the app for you.</p>

<p>I understand with antibiotics the doctors follow strict guidelines, however it’s really interesting when a doctor sends you the guidelines to explain why he won’t give antibiotics for a sinus infection to a person with a weakened immune system for 10 day even though according to the guidelines in my situation it says 3-4 days and it’s been 3. This is after the first doctor brushed me off as a cold. Every time I use this app I’m directed to urgent care, what’s the point of even using it then?</p>

<p>I have tried all day to get my 6 year old son seen today. I could not get him In yesterday and with it being a Saturday today the only places near me where Urgent Cares which we’re wanting $100 upfront even with insurance. I felt defeated because I did not have the money at the time. I saw my insurance offered this app at $0 cost so I tried it. I’m so glad I did it was super quick and easy to use. We had a short video chat but most of it was by text. The doctor was very nice and helpful. She sent in a lot of useful information. He was diagnosed and sent in a prescription to the pharmacy of my choosing. Now my son can get better thanks to this app and the very appreciated doctors. </p>
<p>It is a great app to use for adults and parents that are unable to drive or that just is having a hard time being seen by someone same day. The have doctors available every day of the week on this app. I’m so lucky to have used it. Thank you 98point6!</p>

<p>Doctors don't care. But if you're looking for a super easy doctors note to get out of work or you will be tardy use this app. Mind you your mychart now has virtual urgent care and you actually video chat with a doctor on mychart virtual urgent care. 98point6 they only text you.

<p>APP works but doctors are listed but NOT necessarily local. Had poisoning from AZ plant, got a NY dr or nurse practitioner, not sure. Had no idea what my issue was. No results only a wasted text/time. 1 min video and texting the rest of the "visit". Not sure this is real medical care. It's text care??!!?? Not impressed at all. At least it was 0$ as it wasn't worth a penny. Sorry. Lame telemedicine. But app works. Asks huge amt of questions and took 2 weeks to be registered correctly. Pftt!</p>

<p>Love the experience. 1st time using it. 10/20 update. I was sick and contacted 98 point 6 had fever aore throat etc. Was told to call back on 10 days of not better. Then they would issue a perscription. This service was pointless. The entire point of this service is to keep sick people home and out of office. She even told me to go to urgent care. Why when she clearly could have issued the antibiotic that was needed. Great concept poor service</p>

<p>The app itself functions great but the service seems intended for extremely mild/minor issues. From the two times I've used the service, both times I was directed to urgent care or the ER. It seems, based on my experience, the physicians are very cautious in providing any diagnosis via telehealth. I get it, but then what's the point of the service if the best plan is always seeking in-person care?</p>
