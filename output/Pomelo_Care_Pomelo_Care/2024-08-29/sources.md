Meet your care team

Access your care team 24/7 by text, phone or video. We wonât replace your in-person OB-GYN or midwife, but will support you between visits.

Get 24/7 personalized care

Receive a care plan designed just for you. From managing nausea, to treating hypertension, to supporting you with middle-of-the-night breastfeeding struggles, we cover it all!

Pomelo is offered through certain employers and health plans. Fill out this two-minute questionnaire to see if youâre eligible to receive Pomeloâs services at no cost.

Youâll be assigned a nurse care partner who is with you for the whole journey. Pomelo will also match you to a dedicated care team based on your fertility, pregnancy and postpartum needs. Your care team may include a midwife, primary care physician, therapist, dietitian, lactation consultant, and more!

Pomelo is designed to supplement the care you're getting from an OB-GYN or midwife, providing additional support between in-person appointments. If you donât have an OB-GYN or midwife already, weâll help you find one. If you already have one, weâll work with your in-person care team to make sure weâre collaborating to deliver you the best care possible.

Pomelo is free to members of participating health plans or employers. If there is any out of pocket expense, we will let you know beforehand and you can always opt-out of that particular service.

# [Pomelo Care by Marta Bralic Kerns](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/scaling-maternal-care-that-works)
I started Pomelo because 1 in 10 babies born in the US today starts their life in a neonatal intensive care unit. Maternal morbidity and mortality rates are higher than our peer countries, and the disparities in outcomes for people of color are unacceptable. The evidence exists for how to identify people at highest risk and which interventions are most effective, but there just isnât enough capacity in the healthcare system to apply these interventions at scale.

We are addressing these challenges head on by analyzing claims and health record data to identify individual risk factors, and providing virtual pregnancy, postpartum, and infant care to patients across the country to reduce those risks, dramatically increasing access and improving outcomes.

âCovering 3 million lives with health plan partners

Weâre proud of the milestones weâve achieved over the last year. Since just the beginning of 2024, weâve grown from 2 million covered lives to over 3 million today and are serving patients in 46 states through our commercial and Medicaid health plan partners. And weâre expanding access to quality care for patients: one-third of our care occurs outside of traditional office hours, when patients have real and often urgent needs, but typically canât access care outside of a hospital.

âPublished data that shows our model is working

Most importantly, weâve proven the impact of our care on patients. The evidence is clear on what needs to be done to prevent the severe complications of preeclampsia and perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) â two of the leading drivers of maternal mortality and morbidity in the US. We know that a low dose aspirin regimen reduces preeclampsia risk by 25%, but fewer than 25% of high risk patients start taking aspirin and that too few patients are screened for PMADs and offered timely treatment.

Last month, we presented new data at the ACOG Annual Clinical & Scientific Meeting showing that Pomeloâs telemedicine care dramatically improves both evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis rates (by 2.4x) and mental health screening rates (by 7x) in a Medicaid population.

This fall, weâll present data at both the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Global Congress and the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference & Exhibition showing reductions in emergency room, inpatient, and NICU utilization as a result of Pomeloâs care.

Behind these statistics are patients whose lives changed because they got the care they needed.Â

Like Ava, who had preeclampsia during her first pregnancy and was now pregnant with her second baby, putting her at high risk of developing preeclampsia again. Our provider recommended that she start taking daily low-dose aspirin and spent time sharing the evidence and addressing concerns about taking medication during pregnancy. When Avaâs Pomelo nurse checked in a couple days later to see if she had started her daily aspirin regimen, Ava said she hadn't because she couldn't afford the out-of-pocket cost. Her care team quickly jumped into action to find a bottle of 100 low-dose aspirin for $4 at a local store. Ava started taking low-dose aspirin and stuck with it â significantly reducing her risk of developing preeclampsia. She avoided preeclampsia altogether and delivered at term, with no NICU stay.

Weâve long known what works to address the maternal health crisis. The critical questions have always been: can you identify the patients who are at highest risk, can you deeply engage them in care and drive uptake of the prevention strategies we know work, and can you do it in the highest risk populations with the most limited access to care?

With this data, we proved that we absolutely can.

âNew funding to continue to increase access to evidence-based care

Today, Iâm thrilled to announce that weâve raised a $46M Series B led by our existing investors First Round Capital and a16z. Both of them have had a front-row seat to our fast progress since we announced our Series A last June and wanted to double down. Iâm also excited that Stripes, who I have known since our partnership at Flatiron Health, joined this round along with participation from existing investors including BoxGroup, Operator Partners, and SV Angel. They join our amazing group of angels, including Adam Boehler, Founder and Managing Partner of Rubicon Founders and former Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), and Founder of Landmark Health and Puneet Singh, CEO of Carebridge.

Weâre putting this funding to work to address the root causes of the maternal health crisis, especially for populations most at risk. Our incredible patients deserve more from their healthcare, and our tenacious, humble, and passionate team is committed to fighting for our patients to have the best possible outcomes.

As we enter our next phase of growth at Pomelo, I continue to reflect on the first piece of patient feedback we ever received: âThanks to you, I finally feel safe.â Iâll never forget it. Now, we have the opportunity to help so many more patients have that feeling that they deserve.Â

# [Pomelo Care by Sherry Shenker](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/getting-to-know-pomelos-data-science-team)
At Pomelo, we are scaling a virtual value-based maternity care model to improve access, reduce disparities, and eliminate healthcare gaps for families nationwide. We constantly use data to better understand our patients' needs and behaviors, make our clinicians more efficient, and measure our impact on outcomes.

We sat down with Sherry, a data scientist, to learn more about what makes Pomelo's data team unique.Â

Why did you decide to join Pomelo?

In college, I learned about data science through my interest in public policy and civic technology. I discovered a community tackling problems to improve people's lives, from replacing lead pipes to improving access to government benefits and using data to design more efficient and scalable solutions.Â Over the years, I sought out roles where I could work on challenging, high-impact problems, wear many different hats, and be on teams with smart, thoughtful people.

When I learned that Pomelo was building a scalable way to improve maternal health outcomes, my initial reaction was, "How does this not already exist?"Â I was excited to join a company with an ambitious, impactful mission and so many opportunities to use data to help drive its success.Â

How does the data team at Pomelo operate?

Every company says data is core to its work, but data is genuinely core to how every function at Pomelo operates. We use data to identify eligible patients, understand patient risk factors and prior medical history, and measure the success of our interventions in engaging patients and improving outcomes.Â Â

Our Insights team comprises data scientists, software engineers, data engineers, and product managers and supports the business's data needs. As our company and priorities have changed over time, the problems we focus on and the tools we use have evolved, too. As we navigate this change, our team follows a few important, constant principles âÂ

We invest in centralizing our data and building core data models. Before I joined Pomelo, the team invested in storing all patient health information in a centralized FHIR store, a data standard that we use as the source of truth for every Pomelo patient's health history. We also set up a centralized data warehouse for storing data on everything from clinical interactions and outcomes to marketing and patient engagement. Finally, we continuously build dbt models that standardize and transform data on key entities that we then use as the starting point for more complex analyses.Â

We make analytics-ready data accessible across the whole company.Â With a small data team and a very data-driven culture, there are more daily data requests than we could handle if we completed each one ourselves. So, we use a BI tool that enables anyone at Pomelo to easily modify dashboards and charts (or build their own!). Stakeholders can view key metrics, answer ad-hoc questions, and form hypotheses.Â Making analytics self-service enables teams to get answers to their data questions faster and allows the data team to focus on building scalable, self-service data products and tackling new, more complex challenges.Â

We work directly with other functions to understand challenges and design solutions. Every data scientist knows that working cross-functionally is part of the job. At Pomelo, we collaborate with stakeholders across teams every day. The data team joins early discussions in new problem areas to gather context before building a solution. We shadow and ask our nurses, providers, and specialists questions when solving patient care problems. Data science at Pomelo goes beyond building dashboards and reports â we scope pilots and implement new solutions to address challenges from patient outreach to engagement to outcomes measurement.Â Â

How do you think about measuring success at Pomelo?

As Pomelo quickly grows to serve more and more patients every month, we need to simultaneously be able to measure our impact on patient outcomes and continuously identify where and how we need to improve. To give a few examples, we need to understand:Â Â

Which interventions impact patient outcomes most, such as reduced avoidable Emergency Department visits and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) admissions?Â

Which patients engage the most in our programs? Who are the patients we aren't currently engaging but should be, and how do we engage them?Â

How do improved outcomes translate to healthcare cost savings for our payer partners?Â

Answering these questions is not a month- or quarter-long project; defining and measuring patient outcomes is perpetual, given how often we experiment and evolve our care model.Â The work we've done to characterize patients' interactions, risk factors, and outcomes is the foundation for all of our in-flight and upcoming work, aiming to answer questions like the ones above and inform the decisions that enable us to scaleÂ Â Â

We are just getting started and looking for more impact-driven, collaborative data people to join our team. To learn more, check out our open roles.

We sat down with software engineer Julia Dai to learn about the engineering team at Pomelo.Â

Visit our Careers page to learn more about open roles if you're interested in becoming part of our team.

Why did you decide to join Pomelo?

After starting my career at big tech companies, I was looking for a smaller, tighter-knit team and a mission aligned with my interest in healthcare. Pomelo is addressing a very real, worsening maternal and newborn health crisis in the US. That really resonated. After I met the engineering team â who were so smart, kind, and excited about their work â I knew it was the right next step for me.

Now that Iâve been at Pomelo for almost a year, I feel truly fortunate to be a part of the team. Everyone at Pomelo â from engineering to outreach, clinical, and beyond â is so talented and excellent at what they do. Weâre constantly collaborating to reach our goals and set the bar even higher for what we can achieve. Every day, Iâm excited by the tangible impacts of our products. For me personally, itâs also been so valuable to learn from experienced engineers who are team players and strong mentors.

How does the engineering team power Pomeloâs mission?

At Pomelo, we keep our patients at the center of everything we do. On the engineering team, this means weâre building products and features that streamline how we deliver care to improve patient outcomes and deliver a top tier patient experience.

Grove is our clinical teamâs central command center. Our clinicians use it to communicate with patients, coordinate across care teams, and deliver evidence-based care to improve patient outcomes. Groveâs intelligent workflows and design enable our clinicians to provide timely, personalized care based on each patientâs individual risk factors.

Our data engine powers our care model by identifying individual risk factors and proactively surfacing those risks to our clinical teams in Grove. We ingest and synthesize data from claims, lab, pharmacy, and electronic health record data. Itâs exciting to see how the combination of our data and software have such a meaningful impact on our patientsâ care and our cliniciansâ experience.Â

What Pomelo project are you most proud of?

One of my first projects at Pomelo was actually born out of a mini-hackathon at our company-wide offsite. My teamâs hack used GPT-4 to enable efficient and comprehensive clinical documentation.

I worked with one of our clinicians, Kat, to build a feature that leveraged generative AI to automatically create summaries based on recent clinical interactions. After an impactful demo at the hackathon, I was able to spend the rest of the quarter developing and launching the feature. Itâs been a huge win for patients and clinicians alike. Our patients are heard, and their whole care team has the full context on their care needs and goals. Our clinicians can focus on delivering care, rather than documentation.Â

Iâm really proud of this collaboration between engineering and clinical teams. As a more junior engineer, it was super rewarding for me to have led the project end-to-end, working cross-functionally to deliver meaningful improvements for our team and our patients.

What makes the Pomelo engineering team special?

One of the most unique things about my day-to-day is how closely I work alongside our clinicians. Engineers regularly shadow clinicians to understand product pain points, and see firsthand how this impacts cliniciansâ workflows. This direct feedback channel allows us to quickly iterate on meaningful product improvements.

Engineers are also deeply attuned to the impact we have on patientsâ lives. We hear anonymous patient stories from our clinical team at our company-wide all-hands meetings, and itâs a powerful reminder of each patientâs unique journey. I love hearing how our teamâs combined efforts have a positive impact on our patients and their families.Â Â

Even though our engineering team is distributed all across the US, we stay connected throughout the week to problem solve, share updates, and get feedback. Some team members in New York and San Francisco like to meet up in person regularly, and the whole team gets together for offsites several times a year so we can build relationships, co-work, and have some fun. Pomelo is very big on karaoke.

What excites you about Pomeloâs future?

So many things! Itâs been a very exciting past few weeks as weâve launched health plans in new markets, serving more high-risk and non-English speaking patients. This gives us the opportunity to deliver our care model and improved outcomes to even more patients. As we grow, weâre also thinking about interesting challenges that come with scale, like standardizing patient care for our growing clinical team, surfacing higher-risk patients for care as early as possible, and integrating massive amounts of heterogeneous data. Iâm energized by whatâs ahead!

# [Pomelo Care by Marta Bralic Kerns](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/making-evidence-based-pregnancy-and-newborn-care-universal)
I started my career in a basement room at a state Medicaid agency designing an alternative payment model for maternity care. As I dug through claims and set quality measure benchmarks, I didnât realize the evidence of a national maternal health crisis was buried in those countless lines of data. Today, pregnancy complications remain on the rise, with one in ten newborns starting their life in the NICU and cesarean births increasing 41% over the last two decades. Even more stunning, the maternal mortality rate in the U.S. is more than three times the rate in most other high-income countries, with BIPOC women 2-3x more likely than white women to die from such complications.

Years later, when I had my daughter, Mia, and son, Luka, I experienced a preeclampsia scare, emergency room visits, and a large for gestational age baby. With only a few minutes a month with my OB/GYN, I faced these challenges with many more questions than answers. Millions of other women face similar and more daunting issues â patients like Shelly, one of Pomelo's patients who was gracious enough to share her story with me.

Shelly was overjoyed to become a first time mom at 43 after trying to conceive for many years, but she faced some unexpected complications. Gallstones sent her to the emergency room, where doctors advised her to cut all fat from her diet to prevent them from coming back. She left feeling confused and limited as to what she could eat. Shelly also risked developing gestational diabetes, which increases the risk of preeclampsia and preterm birth. Overwhelmed, she hit dead ends looking for answers on Google despite wanting to make changes to keep herself and her baby healthy.

I started Pomelo Care to help people like Shelly â and families all across the country â have healthy pregnancies and healthy babies.

We designed our approach around three core tenets:

We need to increase access to care, close care gaps, and reduce the friction of getting care for families â weâre available 24/7 with expert maternal and pediatric care teams.

Many pregnancy risk factors are known and addressable â we created data infrastructure to identify these risks earlier by analyzing claims, lab, pharmacy, and electronic health record data, and we surface patient needs to clinicians in real-time via our software platform so a holistic care team can address these risks by treating medical, behavioral, and social needs in concert.

We need a value-based care model that improves outcomes for both mother and baby â we are laser focused on delivering evidence-based care that improves outcomes and reduces costs from avoidable complications.

From my early work in Medicaid to my own pregnancies, to conversations Iâve had with clinical leaders in our field, Iâve long been frustrated by poor access to care, late or no identification and management of risk factors, and the lack of a value-based payment model to change the status quo. So thatâs what weâve built.

Pomelo Care is a virtual, multi-speciality medical practice that uses a value-based care model to address underlying risk factors to improve maternal and newborn health. We provide 24/7 virtual care for patients from preconception until their baby turns one. Our team of OB/GYN, primary care, and pediatric clinicians, mental health therapists, social workers, dietitians, lactation consultants, and other experts care for the whole person. By proactively identifying and treating individual risk factors wherever a patient is â in their life and in the country â we aim to give everyone the personalized, holistic care previously only available to a select few. And we partner with health plans to deliver this care at no cost to patients.

When we met Shelly, we worked with her to create a personalized care plan that met her unique needs and goals. After learning of her gestational diabetes risk, she met with a Pomelo dietitian several times for nutrition counseling and meal planning. She saw a therapist to navigate the ups and downs of pregnancy. Before giving birth, she consulted a lactation specialist to help prepare for breastfeeding. Our team supported Shelly every step of the way and answered all her questions big and small. Shelly never developed gestational diabetes, and she gave birth to a healthy baby boy. Her Pomelo care team continues to help Shelly navigate new milestones like introducing solids to her son, now seven months old. Supporting patients like Shelly is what drives us to reach more patients faster.

Since 2021, weâve been working with leading health plans, managed care organizations including the two largest Medicaid payers, employers including Mount Sinai Health System and Koch Industries, and academic medical centers to improve maternal and newborn health.

Today, Iâm excited to announce that weâve raised $33 million in venture capital funding, led by Andreessen Horowitz and First Round Capital to expand access to evidence-based care to 2 million covered lives this year.

Theyâre joined by SV Angel, Operator Partners, Allen & Company LLC, and BoxGroup, as well as incredible angel investors and healthcare industry leaders, including Adam Boehler (Managing Partner of Rubicon Founders, Former Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, and Founder of Landmark Health), Nat Turner (Co-founder of Flatiron Health), and Puneet Singh (Former Chief Growth Officer, Diversified Business Group at Elevance). This funding will allow us to scale our technology, clinical, and operating teams to meet the needs of a growing patient population.

I donât underestimate the challenge ahead. The maternal health crisis is only getting worse, and care access is increasingly under threat. But we know which interventions can turn the tide in this crisis, thanks to the dedicated efforts of maternal health clinicians and researchers. The challenge is to make these interventions accessible to everyone who needs them. Our team of passionate, smart, humble, and caring people is committed to fighting like hell to break down barriers to accessibility and finally improve outcomes for millions of patients across the country.

Pomelo Care presented data presented at the 2024 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Clinical and Scientific Meeting that showed a 7x increase in depression and anxiety screening and a 2.4x increase in aspirin prophylaxis for preeclampsia prevention in a Medicaid population â impacting two of the leading drivers of maternal morbidity mortality.

Pregnancy-related conditions, including mental health and hypertensive disorders, adversely affect outcomes for women and babies nationwide. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity in the U.S., affecting 1 in 7 hospital deliveries. Mental health conditions are the leading underlying cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the US. However, fewer than 20% of women self-report symptoms of perinatal depression, highlighting an opportunity for better mental health screening to identify symptoms and initiate treatment to improve outcomes.Â

Existing clinical interventions are proven to reduce the risk of preeclampsia by 25% and perinatal depression risk by 40%. Despite these known interventions, patients continue to develop these conditions at alarming rates due to limited and worsening access to maternal care and low rates of these evidence-based interventions, particularly among Medicaid patients. The most recent HEDIS data indicates that only 8.8% of Medicaid patients are screened prenatally for depression. And just 25% or less of pregnant patients with an elevated risk of developing preeclampsia initiate aspirin prophylaxis to reduce preeclampsia risk.

New data from Pomelo demonstrates that its virtual care program effectively scales data-backed interventions to address both preeclampsia and PMAD risk among a Medicaid population. Pomeloâs data showed a:

# [Pomelo Care by Pomelo Care](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/pomelo-care-raises-46-million-and-publishes-data-proving-its-virtual-care-model-improves-outcomes)
NEW YORK, NY â June 20, 2024 â Pomelo Care, a virtual medical practice that improves maternal and newborn health outcomes, announced $46 million in Series B financing led by existing investors First Round Capital and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) Bio + Health. Pomelo will use this funding to accelerate its partnerships with payors across the country to address the root causes of the maternal health crisis.

â1 in 10 babies born in the US today start their life in a neonatal intensive care unit. US maternal morbidity and mortality rates are higher than peer countries, and the disparities in outcomes for people of color are unacceptable. Healthcare access continues to worsen, with 1 in 8 births occurring in U.S. counties with limited-to-no access to maternal care. Due to significant gaps in postpartum care, about half of pregnancy-related deaths in the U.S. occur after hospital discharge.Â

The evidence exists for how to identify people at highest risk for complications and which interventions are most effective, but existing data gaps and provider capacity challenges make it extremely difficult to apply these interventions at scale.

Pomelo has developed a care model that addresses these challenges by analyzing claims and health record data to proactively identify individual risk factors and providing virtual pregnancy, postpartum, and infant care to patients nationwide to reduce those risks, dramatically increasing access to high-quality, evidence-based care and improving outcomes.

âIt's rare to come across an opportunity where the incentives between patient, provider and payor are all aligned,â said Josh Kopelman, Partner at First Round Capital and Pomelo board member. âMarta and the Pomelo team have found an incredible opportunity to dramatically improve outcomes for the highest risk populations, while helping payors reduce their avoidable costs.â

Pomelo has achieved significant milestones this year including:

$46 million in financing: The company today announced $46 million in Series B financing, bringing total funding to $79 million. The Series B was led by existing investors First Round Capital and a16z. Stripes joined this round along with additional participation from existing investors SV Angel, Operator Partners and BoxGroup. They join angels and healthcare industry leaders Adam Boehler, Founder and Managing Partner of Rubicon Founders, Former Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), and Founder of Landmark Health and Puneet Singh, CEO of CareBridge.

Covering over 3 million lives: Since the beginning of 2024, Pomelo has grown its covered lives with health plan partners from 2 million to over 3 million, providing care to patients in 46 states.Â

Published peer-reviewed data proving improvement in clinical outcomes: Pomelo presented new research at the 2024 ACOG Clinical & Scientific Meeting showing that Pomeloâs telemedicine care dramatically scales critical interventions that reduce the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in a Medicaid population â hypertensive disorders like preeclampsia and mental health conditions. Pomeloâs care model increased rates of evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis by 2.4x, proven to reduce preeclampsia risk by 25%, and mental health screening rates by 7x, proven to reduce perinatal depression risk by 40%. This fall, Pomelo will present data at both the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Global Congress and the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference & Exhibition showing reductions in avoidable emergency room, inpatient, and NICU utilization as a result of Pomeloâs care.

âWeâve long known what works to reduce maternal and infant complications. The questions have always been: can you identify the patients who are at highest risk, can you deeply engage them in care to drive uptake of the prevention strategies we know work, and can you do it in the highest risk populations with the most limited access to care?â said Marta Bralic Kerns, Founder & CEO of Pomelo Care. âThis data demonstrates that we absolutely can. And with this additional funding, weâll have the opportunity to scale our care model to more pregnant people across the country.â

âPomelo is one among a small set of health tech companies that have earned true scale,â shared Vineeta Agarwala, MD, PhD, General Partner at a16z Bio + Health and Pomelo board member. âThis scale is evident in our partnerships with major Medicaid and commercial plans covering over 3 million lives, which create the opportunity to collaborate with OB providers, labor and delivery wards, and NICUs nationwide, while serving hundreds of thousands of expecting mothers and newborns with high quality, technology-enabled care.â

NEW YORK, NY â June 8, 2023 â Pomelo Care, a virtual medical practice that improves maternal and newborn health outcomes, today announced $33 million in Seed and Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz. The capital will fuel Pomeloâs continued partnership expansion with major health plans, including several Medicaid managed care organizations, employers and leading academic medical centers on the front lines of the national maternal health crisis.Â

Pomeloâs multispecialty team of expert clinicians cares for mothers and infants from preconception through pregnancy, birth and one year postpartum, spanning everything from prenatal care to nutrition and lactation to mental health. Its value-based virtual care model pairs each patient with a personalized care team to comprehensively address maternal health inequities and the root causes of poor outcomes. Pomelo uses data to predict and proactively identify risk, provides holistic care leveraging evidence-based protocols and novel care programs and makes 24/7 care accessible via phone, text and video.Â

âWe know that the right care at the right time can dramatically improve outcomes for families. Everyone deserves access to high-quality care, regardless of their circumstances or health plan,â said Marta Bralic Kerns, founder and CEO at Pomelo Care. âThatâs why Pomelo exists â we address patient concerns right away and at home, keeping them out of the emergency room unnecessarily and lowering their risk of pregnancy, postpartum and newborn complications.âÂ

Since its founding in 2021, Pomelo has achieved significant milestones, including:

$33 million in capital raised: The company today announced Series A financing, which follows its 2021 Seed round. Andreessen Horowitz led both funding rounds, with additional participating investors First Round Capital (who co-led the Seed round), SV Angel, Operator Partners, Allen & Company LLC and BoxGroup, joined by angel investors and healthcare industry leaders including Adam Boehler, Managing Partner of Rubicon Founders, Former Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), and Founder of Landmark Health and Puneet Singh, Former Chief Growth Officer, Diversified Business Group at Elevance.

On track to cover two million lives this year: Pomelo currently serves patients in 44 states and partners with national payers, several of the largest Medicaid managed care organizations in the country, employers including Mount Sinai Health System and leading academic medical centers including Penn Medicine.Â

> 4.9/5 average patient satisfaction: Pomelo provides 24/7 access to care with one-third of patient interactions taking place outside of traditional clinic hours and an average response time of five minutes.

Despite spending $111 billion annually on maternal healthcare, the U.S. has some of the highest rates of preterm birth, NICU admissions and preventable maternal complications in the developed world. Maternal mortality worsened during the pandemic, with poor maternal and newborn outcomes remaining even more common in communities of color and rural areas. One in ten newborns start their life in the NICU and cesarean births have increased 41% over the last two decades. However, with evidence-based and accessible interventions, preterm births can be reduced by 33%, cesarean deliveries reduced by 40% and the average NICU stay reduced by at least four days.Â

Pomeloâs team consists of clinicians â 50% of whom are BIPOC â technologists and executives, with backgrounds at leading hospitals, academic medical centers and technology companies. The teamâs previous experience spans Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Duke University Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Flatiron Health, Kaiser Permanente, Emory University Hospital, Google and Stripe. Pomelo also announced the appointment of Vineeta Agarwala, MD, PhD, General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, and Josh Kopelman, Partner at First Round Capital, to the companyâs board of directors.Â

"Itâs inexcusable that women in the U.S. face one of the highest national mortality rates from preventable complications during pregnancy â and this statistic is only worsening year over year due to social disparities and systemic gaps in care delivery and access,â said Agarwala. âPomelo Careâs technology-driven, value-based care model completely reimagines how new families access high quality specialty care and achieve better outcomes while also reducing costs for our leading health plans, health systems and employers.âÂ
