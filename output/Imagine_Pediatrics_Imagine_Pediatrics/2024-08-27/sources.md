# [Virtual Health Care for Children](https://www.imaginepediatrics.org/)
Our intervention

Our mobile team was dispatched to the patient's home and connected with an Imagine Pediatrics pediatrician via video to complete a medical visit. An in-home exam and urinalysis test was positive for a UTI. Our doctor was able to prescribe oral antibiotics, fluids, and medication for vomiting and fever, and the mobile team was able to administer these treatments. Our team left an additional supply of antibiotics with her mother and ordered the remaining medications vie home delivery pharmacy.

Our impact

Because medications were provided immediately, the child could begin healing right away and avoided a trip to the ER.

Our intervention

Our outreach associate asked if any of our pediatricians could see a patient for a combined onboarding and sick visit. An Imagine Pediatrics physician immediately got on the phone with the patientâs mom and held a virtual video visit, treating the child for an upper respiratory infection.

Our impact

The patient avoided an ER visit. A follow-up visit showed the child recovered from illness and is back to baseline with ongoing care from our team.

Our intervention

We provided care encompassing social, medical, and emotional support. We educated the patientâs mom about her childâs medical equipment. And, to help provide him with care at home, we used our app for a video visit with his mom and Private Duty Nurse to help manage the increase in his breakthrough seizures. We also identified local resources to prevent eviction, including options for new, supportive housing and safe transportation to a new home.

Our impact

Our patient and their PDN were able to manage breakthrough seizures at home until the first appointment at a new high-risk clinic, preventing unnecessary hospital visits. The family also got access to critical housing resources.

# [Imagine Pediatrics](https://www.imaginepediatrics.org/contact)
Our intervention

We enrolled a 5-year-old child with congenital heart disease in our program. One of our pediatric nurses learned about their detailed medical history and realized the family had been struggling with gaps in care.

Our impact

Our team was able to coordinate care with a cardiologist and provide ongoing visits with a pediatrician. We are able to chat with the childâs family whenever they have a concern, with a goal of avoiding future hospital visits.

Our intervention

A 3-year old child with a complex seizure disorder kept ending up in the ER with new symptoms. The family faced several barriers while trying to access the specialty neurology care their child needed.

Our impact

We enrolled the patient in our program, found the right in-network neurologist, got the referral the child needed, and we are now working with the family to provide top quality ongoing care. They are relieved to know that weâre advocating for them and are more confident that theyâre getting the best possible care for their child.

Our intervention

Our team worked with the patientâs health plan to initiate a new referral to their cardiologist and re-engage the patient with their pediatrician.

Our impact

Despite a gap in care, the patient was able to restart their relationship with their preferred doctors with the support of our care coordination services.

Our intervention

We provided an immediate virtual visit with the child and her mom, noting an infection in her eczema flare. Our provider prescribed a topical and oral antibiotic with additional steroid ointment to treat the flare and co-existing infection. We followed up with her mom that same evening and throughout the week to ensure the infection was clearing.

Our impact

The patient was able to access a pediatrician right away despite previous difficulty finding a PCP. Her infection cleared, and her mom received ongoing support for managing her daughterâs chronic conditions.

Our impact

The patient avoided an unnecessary ER visit and hospitalization and gained access to necessary specialty care.

Our intervention

In a video visit that same morning, our pediatrician helped determine that the new symptoms did not require emergency care. We connected with the childâs endocrinologist and, together, made a plan to pause hormone therapy and schedule an urgent follow-up endocrinology visit.

Currently, we support patients in Texas and Florida.

We help expand the collective impact of care teams by providing more medical, behavioral, and social care in the home to children with medical complexity and special health care needs.

â

We aim to give care teams more peace of mind by giving our shared patients additional acute care coverage 24/7 â in particular during off work hours at night, over the weekend, and on holidays.

â

Caregivers are welcome to call us at (833) 208-7770 to see if their child qualifies.

Parents and caregivers can expect to be heard and helped as they care for their child. Throughout the enrollment process, we listen closely to caregivers to learn all about their childâs needs.

We also help with equipment repairs and replacements. All of our services are designed to improve the life and health of a child with medical complexity. So they can stay out of the hospital, and we can bring their caregivers some relief and peace of mind.

Yes. When a child enrolls in our services, they keep all their current doctors. We do not replace anyone on a childâs existing care team. We partner with their doctors to provide an extra layer of 24/7 care and support in the home. When a child we care for has a change in symptoms, we help parents and caregivers decide if their child can be cared for at home, if they should get an in-home visit from a member of our care team, or if they should be taken to the emergency room.

â

We also provide extra help to private duty nurses based in the home. We can help them get a prior authorization, medication refills, or equipment support. We are also available to them anytime they have a question or need a quick consultation.

# [How It Works: Virtual At-Home Pediatric Care in TX & FL](https://www.imaginepediatrics.org/how-it-works)
We are a multidisciplinary, pediatrician-led medical group. We provide virtual-first care in the home for children with medical complexity. Our team is made up of doctors, nurses, social workers, and other clinical team members.

â

We know that as a parent or caregiver, you face many challenges as you care for their child. Thatâs why we are ready, day and night, to help you get the high-quality care and support your child deserves.

â

We do not replace your childâs current doctors. We work with them to give every patient an extra layer of medical, behavioral, and social support. We help the children we care for avoid unnecessary emergency room visits and spend more time thriving at home and in their communities.

When your child is enrolled in our services, parents and caregivers can call or message us anytime using our mobile app. We are ready to help 24/7. We will answer your questions, get on a video call, or, in some cases, visit your home to diagnose and treat your child. If your child has an acute episode, we can provide care and support right away, at any time of the day or night.

â

âWe work closely with parents and caregivers like you to support your child. We can help with medication and equipment. We can find specialists, set appointments, and complete paperwork. We can also connect you to other services that your child might need.Â

â

âAlmost everything we do is virtual, so our patients and their caregivers donât have to leave home to get care and support. This comes at no cost for eligible kids, because our services are part of their existing health plan benefits. We currently partner with health plans in Texas and Florida. We are working to expand to other states in 2024 and beyond.

This is your time to share your childâs needs with our clinical team, so we can get to know your child better â and help with your immediate needs. We understand that you know your child best. So, we listen to all the details of your childâs conditions, meds, and allergies. Youâll also tell us what good days and bad days look like for you and your child. And, you can ask any questions you have about how we can help you. This call helps us be ready to help you and your child quickly â whether they need care right then or at any time in the future.

â

Please call us at 833-208-7770 to schedule this appointment â and get started with our services. Â

You can expect to be heard and helped every step of the way. In your initial onboarding appointment, we listen closely to you to learn all about your childâs needs â their conditions, meds, and allergies â so that any time your child needs care, we can help immediately. From then on, our team of doctors, nurses, social workers, and other clinicians will be ready 24/7 to provide care and support. We help you get referrals and medication refills. We also help with equipment repairs and replacements.

â

All of our services are designed to improve the life and health of your child with medical complexity. So they can stay out of the hospital, and we can bring you some relief and peace of mind.

Yes, your child will keep all their current doctors.

â

We do not replace anyone on your childâs existing care team. We partner with their doctors to provide an extra layer of 24/7 care and support in the home. When your child has a change in symptoms, we will help decide if your child can be cared for at home, if they should get an in-home visit from a member of our care team, or if they should be taken to the emergency room.

â

We also provide extra help to private duty nurses based in the home. We can help them get a prior authorization, medication refills, or equipment support. We are also available to them anytime they have a question or need a quick consultation.
