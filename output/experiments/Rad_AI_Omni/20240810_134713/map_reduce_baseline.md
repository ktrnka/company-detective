A Reddit user expresses frustration with the new Powerscribe One (PSOne) software, citing issues like a poor user interface, loss of keyboard shortcuts, and frequent crashes, leading to a negative consensus among users about its performance compared to the previous version, PS360. In a separate discussion, users speculate about the DNA included in the Omnitrix, with theories suggesting it may belong to Zenith, Azmuth's ex, rather than Azmuth or Albedo, ultimately leaning towards an unknown source.
