  "summary_markdown": "# About Wokelo\n\nWokelo is a technology company that specializes in AI-powered research platforms, focusing on automating complex research workflows such as due diligence, sector research, and portfolio monitoring. The company was founded on February 9, 2023, by Siddhant Masson and Saswat Nanda. It is headquartered in Seattle, with an additional office in Bengaluru, India [(Crunchbase, 2024)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wokelo-ai).\n\nWokelo's primary product is a platform that leverages proprietary large language model (LLM) based agents to automate and streamline the curation, synthesis, and triangulation of data, delivering client-ready outputs. This platform is particularly beneficial for private equity funds, investment banks, consulting firms, and corporates, helping them make data-driven decisions [(Crunchbase, 2024)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wokelo-ai).\n\nThe company operates on a B2B model, serving over 35 clients, including private equity and venture capital firms. As of the latest reports, Wokelo employs 13 people [(KPMG, 2023)](https://kpmg.com/us/en/media/news/kpmg-wokelo-investment-2024.html) [(VCCircle, 2024)](https://www.vccircle.com/zeeinvests-in-flutrr-datazip-three-others-pocket-early-stage-cheques).\n\nWokelo has raised a total of $5 million in funding, with a $4 million seed round completed on October 7, 2024, and a previous $1 million round on June 20, 2023. The recent funding round included participation from KPMG Ventures and Array Ventures, among others [(Crunchbase, 2024)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wokelo-ai).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Siddhant Masson**: Co-founder and CEO of Wokelo. He has emphasized the company's commitment to transforming large and diverse data sets into actionable insights, aiming to enhance decision-making processes for clients [(KPMG, 2023)](https://kpmg.com/us/en/media/news/kpmg-wokelo-investment-2024.html).\n\n- **Saswat Nanda**: Co-founder of Wokelo. Further details about his background and role are not specified in the available sources.\n\n# News\n\n## Funding and Investment\n\nWokelo secured $4 million in seed funding in October 2024, with KPMG Ventures and Array Ventures among the investors. This funding is intended to support the development of Wokelo's technology and enhance its data analysis capabilities. KPMG's investment also includes a minority equity stake, which will allow Wokelo to integrate its AI-driven insights with KPMG's deal advisory and strategy expertise [(KPMG, 2023)](https://kpmg.com/us/en/media/news/kpmg-wokelo-investment-2024.html) [(VCCircle, 2024)](https://www.vccircle.com/zeeinvests-in-flutrr-datazip-three-others-pocket-early-stage-cheques).\n\n## Partnerships\n\nWokelo's collaboration with KPMG is a significant development, aiming to set a new standard in data analysis and intelligence gathering. Carole Streicher, KPMG's Head of Deal Advisory, highlighted the strategic importance of this partnership, noting that AI is enhancing their approach to dealmaking and post-close integration [(KPMG, 2023)](https://kpmg.com/us/en/media/news/kpmg-wokelo-investment-2024.html).\n\n## Product and Market Position\n\nWokelo's platform is designed to automate and streamline data collection, curation, synthesis, and triangulation, providing client-ready outputs. Key features include automated workflow design, real-time analytics, customizable AI models, and integration-friendly capabilities [(Futurepedia, 2024)](https://www.futurepedia.io/tool/wokelo).\n\nWokelo operates in a competitive landscape with other AI-driven platforms like Dili, Ansarada, and AlphaSense. However, its unique approach of producing comprehensive reports quickly gives it a competitive edge. Yohei Nakajima, a general partner at Untapped Capital, praised Wokelo's efficiency in generating detailed reports [(Roundup, 2024)](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/the-rapid-experimentation-of-ai-agents).\n\n## Executive Insights\n\nSiddhant Masson, CEO of Wokelo, has expressed the company's focus on accelerating research and synthesis to support strategic decision-making in a dynamic environment [(KPMG, 2023)](https://kpmg.com/us/en/media/news/kpmg-wokelo-investment-2024.html).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWokelo is positioned as a promising player in the AI-driven research and due diligence space, with significant backing from KPMG and a strong product offering. The recent funding and strategic partnerships are likely to enhance its market presence and technological capabilities, making it an attractive option for prospective candidates and investors looking to engage with innovative solutions in the AI landscape.

There are companies like DeckMatch that are starting with deck translation and analysis, but that too is a feature Harmonic can easily clone. \n\nMost VCs today use Perplexity, GPT, or [You.com](http://You.com) for free to handle market sizing and support additional competitive analysis, but they're really only looking for a few cut and paste data points to support a decision they've already made to either do a deal or pass... \"According to XYZ industry reports, the ABC market was $XXB in 2022 and expected to grow by some double digit percentage through 2029.\" \n\nThat said, most due dilligence is done talking to customers and prospective buyers, testing the product, and calling SMEs in one's network to gauge the viability and feasibility of the opportunity, which sometimes leads VCs to AlphaSense or AlphaSights or some combination of the two.\n\nAs far as next generation market research tools go, the VCs who are ahead of the curve appear to be using either Wokelo or Velvet, but as you look further up market you run into [www.rogodata.com](http://www.rogodata.com) and Termina.ai. \n\nTo be fair, most funds can't afford the $25K annual spends on Harmonic and Wokelo, or at least they're not yet willing to use these tools to replace an associate, but that still leaves a dozen other tools already in market I haven't even bothered to name.\n\nVCs are only now starting to think about their own internal tooling. Some funds are led by partners who couldnt use technology to save their own lives... like a migration from Microsoft Outlook to Gmail is a heavy lift for them. On top of that this market is small and probably won't support more than $20M-$25M in ARR unless you replace other VC tools like Affinity over time. \n\nI say education, non-profits, and hospitals because these are huge markets with shit products that were forced to embrace tech during COVID. There's less skepticism and resistance now around using new software that make these institutions more efficient and effective. \n\nI often run health pitches by a surgeon friend at Stanford, and the only thing he's gotten excited about so far is a notetaker app... Obviously the regulatory barriers are still high, but the barriers to delighting customers are extremely low. I think there are real pockets of opportunity if you have an internal champion. \n\nSimilarly I have teacher friends who are using off the shelf AI products for almost every aspect of program delivery especially around content. I think you can easily build an AI suite of services around teachers under 40 and see if there isnt an enteprise opportunity you can grow into with internal champions. \n\nInterestingly enough, the non profit and philanthropy ecosystem works very similarly to the VC ecosystem excepts its clunkier and impact focused, but you still have a buyer and seller dynamic between grant makers and grantees that's similar to VC and startups. There are also nonprofit databases you can crawl and build analytics on top to help grant makers source and vet nonprofits more efficiently and effectively. You could probably start with either a grant-writing tool or a grant assessment tool that screens out applications that are \"not a good fit for the fund.\"\n\n## Comment ID l61uyvp with +2 score by [(Main_Effective7448, Reddit, 2024-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/venturecapital/comments/1d2mctd/market_research_tool_for_vcs_and_other_investors/l61uyvp/) (in reply to ID 1d2mctd):\npm'd\n\n## Comment ID l620el4 with +2 score by [(shmaylob, Reddit, 2024-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/venturecapital/comments/1d2mctd/market_research_tool_for_vcs_and_other_investors/l620el4/) (in reply to ID 1d2mctd):\nWhat kind of sources does your AI have?

      "# [The rapid experimentation of AI agents by Dan Poppy on 2024-06-09](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/the-rapid-experimentation-of-ai-agents)\nYohei Nakajima is an investor by day and coder by night. In his day job, he invests in early stage companies as a general partner at Untapped Capital. As a hacker, he's been focused of late on the applications of AI.\n\nIn particular, one of his projects, called BabyAGI, got a ton of attention about a year ago. BabyAGI is an AI agent framework, creating a plan-execute loop. If you give it a goal, it will create a plan to achieve this goal, and then go execute on this plan. All of this plays out in a long chain of LLM API calls, and you can observe every step along the way.\n\nThe truth is that this is an extremely experimental space, and depending on how strict you want to be with your definition, there aren't a lot of production use cases to point to today of AI agents. When you watch the demo videos on Yohei's Twitter feed, you can immediately see the promise.\n\nJoin data practitioners and leaders in Las Vegas this October at Coalesce, the Analytics Engineering Conference built by data people, for data people.

It's always been a hobby I've always had on my side. I've never been an engineer by trade, but I've been coding as a hobby since high school. And I became more of a no-coder for a while, just because with the limited time to build, no-code was easier. But when I started using AI, I realized that I could pump out some pretty cool code in a matter of two to three hours, so I switched back to code about a year after I started using OpenAI. That's where all my GitHub projects come from.\n\nDo you want to take a minute to plug a company or two that you've invested in recently, for the audience to see what you're seeing on the VC side?\n\nOne of the tools that I use every day, which is the easiest plug, is a company called Wokelo.ai. They do AI research and due diligence. When I'm interested in a company, I can just type in the company name and click Generate Report. Thirty minutes later, I get a 20-50 page report that includes market insights, recent news, competitors, management profiles, all that kind of stuff. It really is the kind of work you’d ask analysts to do and it’d take them two weeks to do, but it's in 30 minutes.\n\nBased on the deal flow that you're seeing, what are some underreported things that will be true about the world in two or three years that no one's paying attention to?\n\nI've done a couple of talks on autonomous agents, and one of the things that gets more of a reaction is the idea of an agent who is a CEO. When people think about AI right now, you imagine AI at the bottom of the rung. But an example I give is Amazon Mechanical Turk or Upwork. These are technology platforms that help you manage people. And now imagine taking this capability of LLMs and rebuilding something like an Amazon Mechanical Turk.\n\nYou can imagine how you could build an agent that can manage a college ambassador program and that AI can do that more efficiently than a human, in theory. If you extend that, then why can't you have a CEO who's available 24-7, has access to every single piece of data in the company, can take feedback from every single employee and synthesize it, and has bias that's at least measurable and transparent, so you can adjust it, versus wondering if they're being unfair.\n\nOne of our values as a company is we move up the stack. It's an invitation to always replace yourself. And if there is a very effective AI CEO, I'm ready.\n\nThe initial idea around BabyAGI was to prototype an autonomous startup founder.\n\nI think AI is far from being able to build an innovative startup that becomes a unicorn. But if we pick something that's a little bit more straightforward and purely digital, like an e-commerce dropshipping business, I think it's within reach to build an AI system that can run and manage something like that.\n\nTell us about BabyAGI. What is it? And what have people built with it?\n\nI think the reason BabyAGI went viral was at that point, ChatGPT was still relatively new. People were still building on top of that chat interface. BabyAGI was one of the first popular open-source projects to loop in LLM.\n\nI added some capabilities so when you're given an objective, I’d first have a task list creation agent to generate a task list based on that objective. And then I would use code to parse that out. And then send each task one by one to an execution agent to execute that.\n\nWhen I was generating new tasks, I had a task prioritization agent, which would review past results and update the task list. It would then check for the most similar tasks first, so that it would try to generate new kind of tasks. And what happens when you press run, build a business, it would just come up with things to do.\n\nAt this point it was just LLM calls; it was just generating tasks. But when I asked it to start a business—I need a marketing plan, I need to build a website, I need to come up with product ideas—it just kept going one by one on, like we do around building a business.\n\nThis has become commonly referred to as an agent, this idea that there's an AI that operates in a loop and it plans and it executes, and it can to a certain extent take actions in the real world. I think this is not a new idea, but it is an idea that maybe it's time has come. Is that a fair way to think about it?\n\nI agree. It's not a new idea to let a software program autonomously run. I think with LLM capabilities you could finally get it to reason, do similarity search, and do it in a way that was much more robust.\n\nCan you talk at all about agent architectures? Are there better and worse ways to construct agents?\n\nWhen new technology emerges, there's a period of rapid experimentation. If you look at old cars, there are three-wheeled cars, there are steam-engine cars.\n\nBut if you look today, a lot of the cars or phones, they all look the same today. With autonomous agents, we're in the rapid experimentation phase, where there's a whole bunch of different frameworks, a whole bunch of different architectures, a whole bunch of different approaches.\n\nIt's hard to say which one's going to stick, but ultimately there’ll be some consolidation. So I think it helps if you're thinking about architecture, just look at them each one by one. Task planning is probably one of the main ones. The two major ways is the react style, which is to do one thing at a time and reflect on it. And then there's the BabyAGI style—plan and execute—which is generate a task list first and then go through them.\n\nBut of course there's a fuzzy line because you can generate a task list first and then reflect on each result to update the task list. It's not one or the other.\n\nHow should we think about where we will see agents impacting our lives first?\n\nI think about it in three buckets. I think of the first bucket as what I call handcrafted agents, where you are writing each problem. And you're chaining it specifically with API calls and it's a very specific flow. Some people would call that not autonomous because it's a human generating the task list and you're not AI running it autonomously. That being said, with the idea of Wokelo, if I can give an AI a company and it's going to give me back a 30-50 page report, from a usage standpoint, it feels very autonomous to me.\n\nAnd then there's what I call the specialized agent, which is the I think where it becomes truly autonomous, it's dynamically generating its own task list or recursively figuring out what to do, but it's within a specific set of skills and tools. So you can imagine a coding-specialized agent for a VC specialization that just knows how to look up CrunchBase.\n\nAnd then there's the general-purpose, fully generalized autonomous agent.\n\nHandcrafted agents are useful today. I mean, Wokelo is one specific example, but I know many companies that are doing handcrafted agents. This is humans generating the task list and they're charging lots of money with low churn, and they're creating value.\n\nWith specialized agents, what I'm seeing right now is pretty interesting demos with a lot of promise. These companies are raising capital; they're starting to have conversations with enterprises because they're interested, and they are starting to line up pilots because these companies are willing to test it.\n\nBut I haven't seen anything that's blowing me away in terms of reliability and value creation.\n\nAnd then when it comes to general automation, I haven't seen anything remotely close to reliable. I also don't think of them as three fully separate buckets, but actually more of starting here and slowly moving to there.\n\nCan you talk at all about why agent designers switch between different models for different tasks?\n\nDifferent models have different strengths is the shortest answer. Some models are better than others at writing code. Some models are better than others at writing long pieces in an eloquent manner. And it's constantly shifting.\n\nDevelopers are looking at the cost, the speed, and the quality of each model, and when I say quality, specific to the use case. So with an agent system, you have parts that need to write code, parts that need to respond to the user, so depending on the specific need you're swapping out models to see which one is optimal.\n\nNow that language models can write code, can formulate their outputs and inputs as JSON or other structured data, is there any particular limit on what types of actions they could take in the world?\n\nThe first thing that popped to mind was anything that requires a physical body will be hard for a digital agent to do unless you give them the robotic parts to do so, but again, I wouldn't say that's a limit, like we can build the robotic parts and we can give them division capabilities and we can do those things.\n\nWhat's so interesting to me is messaging. Are there agents in the world today that are connected to the Twilio API or to SMTP and sending emails? Yeah,\n\nDefinitely. There are tons of emails that are automatically sent. But I think the question you're asking is, are there any that are fully dynamically managing it on its own? Probably.\n\nDo you think that most AI workflows are going to be created by software engineers? Or because the capabilities of AI are so powerful in the realm of writing code, are they actually going to be created by less technical folks who are closer to the business?\n\nThis is a little bit more of a hypothesis. I don't know is the short answer, but I would guess, based on my experience building it, that you need a really good core framework, and that has to be built by the engineers. And the whole point of the framework should really be around a good agent should be one that the more you use it, the better it gets.\n\nIn the future, when you say, who's building the task list, I don't think it's the engineers. It's the users who are going to ask an AI to do something, and then when an AI doesn't do it the right way, it'll give it guidance, and the AI will remember how to do it that way and keep you getting better.\n\nThe engineers will be building essentially how the brain works itself, but just like how you and I have gotten better at things, the AI is going to get better by working for somebody and getting feedback from that person.\n\nWhat do you hope is true about the data or in this case, the AI space in five years?\n\nI hope that we’ll see more use cases of AI with the goal of helping people better understand each other. I actually did a TED talk on it, the idea that AI can help us better understand ourselves and each other, both through the usage and building of it.\n\nThis newsletter is sponsored by dbt Labs.

      "# [Dili wants to automate due diligence with AI by Kyle Wiggers on 2024-02-19](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/19/dili-wants-to-automate-due-diligence-with-ai/)\nStephanie Song, formerly on the corporate development and ventures team at Coinbase, was often frustrated by the volume of due diligence tasks she and her team had to complete on a daily basis.\n\n“Analysts burn the midnight oil working hundreds of hours doing the work that nobody wants to do,” Song told TechCrunch in an email interview. “At the same time, funds are deploying less capital and looking for ways to make their teams more efficient while reducing operating costs.”\n\nInspired to find a better way, Song teamed up with Brian Fernandez and Anand Chaturvedi, two ex-Coinbase colleagues, to launch Dili (not to be confused by the capital of East Timor), a platform that attempts to automate key investment due diligence and portfolio management steps for private equity and VC firms using AI.\n\nDili, a Y Combinator graduate, has raised $3.6 million in venture funding to date from backers, including Allianz Strategic Investments, Rebel Fund, Singularity Capital, CoreNest, Decacorn, Pioneer Fund, NVO Capital, Amino Capital, Rocketship VC, Hi2 Ventures, Gaingels and Hyper Ventures.\n\n“[AI] affects all parts of an investment fund, from analysts to partners and back-office functions,” Song said. “Investment professionals at funds are looking for a differentiated edge on decision-making, and can now use their wealth of data to combine their understanding of the deal with how it fits into the funds . . . Dili has a unique opportunity to emerge as a solution for funds in a harsh macro environment.”\n\nSong’s not wrong about funds looking for an edge — or any new promising ways to mitigate investing risk, for that matter. VCs reportedly have $311 billion in unspent cash, and last year raised the lowest total — $67 billion — in seven years as they grew increasingly cautious about early-stage ventures.\n\nDili isn’t the first to apply AI to the due diligence process. Gartner predicts that by 2025, more than 75% of VC and early-stage investor executive reviews will be informed using AI and data analytics.\n\nSeveral startups and incumbents are already tapping AI to pour through financial documents and copious amounts of data to craft market comparisons and reports — including Wokelo (whose customers are private equity and VC funds, like Dili’s), Ansarada, AlphaSense and Thomson Reuters (through its Clear Adverse Media unit).\n\nBut Song insists that Dili uses “first-of-its-kind” technology.\n\n“[We can] deliver very high accuracy on specific tasks like pulling financial metrics from large unstructured documents,” she added. “We’ve built custom indexing and retrieval pipelines tuned for specific documents to provide [our AI] models with high quality context.”\n\nDili leverages generative AI, specifically large language models along the lines of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, to streamline investor workflows.\n\nThe platform first catalogs a fund’s historical financial data and investment decisions in a knowledge base and then applies the aforementioned models to automate tasks such as parsing databases of private company data, handling due diligence request lists and digging for little-known figures across the web.\n\nDili recently added support for automated comparable analysis and industry benchmarking on a firm’s backlog of deals. Once funds upload their deal data, they can compare historical and current investment opportunities in one place.\n\n“Imagine being able to get an email with a new investment opportunity or portfolio company update and instantly having a platform produce AI-generated deal red flags, competitive analysis, industry benchmarking and a preliminary summary or memo leveraging your fund’s historical investing patterns,” Song said.\n\nThe question is, can Dili’s AI — or any AI really — be trusted when it comes to managing a portfolio?\n\nAI isn’t necessarily known for sticking to facts, after all. Fast Company tested ChatGPT’s ability to sum up articles and found that the model had a tendency to get stuff wrong, leave pieces out and outright invent details not mentioned in the articles it summarized. It’s not tough to imagine how this might become a real problem in due diligence work, where accuracy is paramount.\n\nAI can also bring prejudices into the decisioning process. In an experiment conducted by Harvard Business Review several years ago, an algorithm trained to make startup investment recommendations was found to pick white entrepreneurs rather than entrepreneurs of color and preferred investing in startups with male founders. That’s because the public data the algorithm was trained on reflected the fact that fewer women and founders from underrepresented groups tend to be disadvantaged in the funding process — and ultimately raise less venture capital.\n\nThen there’s the fact that some firms might not be comfortable running their private, sensitive data through a third-party model.\n\nTo attempt to allay all those fears, Song said that Dili is continuing to fine-tune its models — many of which are open source — to reduce instances of hallucination and improve overall accuracy. She also stressed that private customer data isn’t used to train Dili’s models and that Dili plans to offer a way for funds to create their own models trained on proprietary, offline fund data.\n\n“While hedge funds and public markets have invested heavily in tech, private market data has a lot of untapped potential that Dili could unlock for firms,” Song said.\n\nDili ran an initial pilot last year with 400 analysts and users across different types of funds and banks. But as the startup expands its team and adds new capabilities, it’s angling to expand into new applications — ultimately toward becoming an “end-to-end” solution for investor due diligence and portfolio management, Song says.\n\n“Eventually we believe this core technology we’re building can be applied to all parts of the asset allocation process,” she added.",

      "# [Evolving Market Map — Marketing Stack with GenAI by Mininath Jirage, medium.com on 2024-01-20](https://medium.com/@mininathjirage/evolving-market-map-marketing-stack-with-genai-5eb83b7d4678)\nMininath Jirage\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n6 min read\n\n·\n\nJan 20, 2024\n\n--\n\nLinkedIn reported that “77% of CMOs globally feel under pressure to prove greater short-term ROI on their marketing campaigns” and that “90% of marketers say improving CFO understanding of ROI is key to bolstering future budgets.” This tells us that marketing teams want to deliver the ROI on their investments in the marketing stack. Other factors that strengthen this are as follows:\n\nAs it gets difficult to acquire new customers, companies will double down on retaining existing customers to protect their revenue base. Buyers need to justify tech purchases more than ever.\n\nMarket will see significant downward pricing pressures with new pricing models — Seat Based Pricing, Usage-Based Pricing, and Staff Augmentation Pricing becoming prominent. This trend will favour lower-priced solutions at the expense of higher-priced competitors.\n\nTo capture more revenues from existing customers, companies will step into each other’s lanes with new features or products. Market will reward a shift from “Best of Breed SaaS” to “All in One”\n\nWhat are the different stages of the SaaS funnel?\n\nB2B marketers use Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) as the core metric to measure the performance of their funnel. However, there are many moving parts involved in both digital and offline channels, making it difficult to maintain consistency in the state of your funnel. With increased cost pressures and ROI expectations on marketing dollars, there is a need for tools that can automate certain functions within marketing teams using GenAI to solve predictable outcomes. The key to this is data, but it's not enough to just have data. It should be a single source of truth that can be integrated and analyzed to make intelligent decisions on your content, email outreach, campaign messaging, SEO, CRO, outbound motion, and other go-to-market activities.\n\nFirst of all, What is MarkTech?\n\nMarkTech is a term used to describe software tools that are used by marketing teams to attract and retain customers. It involves handling customers' data, its storage, and analytics.\n\nEvolving Marketing Stack\n\nBelow is a market map of the modern marketing data stack. There needs to be a clear distinction between the foundational data technologies that every company needs across functions and teams (such as data integration, business intelligence, and AI) and the marketing and advertising-specific technologies that sit atop that foundation (such as identity, activation, and specific measurement tools).\n\nBreaking down data in silos is still very much a top priority for a large chunk of the market, especially those who are slow to adopt the stack.\n\nTop Trends in MarkTech Stack and Shift Due to GenAI :\n\n1)AI/ML: LLM emergence — Marketing is one of the most impacted fields due to LLMs. GenAI is going to automate and improve a wide range of marketing functions, including:\n\na)Ad campaign optimization: Insights to improve audience segmentation and ad placement will emerge, improving conversion rates and campaign ROI. Product discovery will happen through AI as it is better and faster. As AI-assisted search comes into the mainstream through apps such as Perplexity or Microsoft Bing Chat, Prompt discovery will become important with Search discovery. Search engine optimization (SEO) experts will work along with Prompt Engineering Optimization (PEO) specialists. I see that the Search space will evolve on a hybrid stack where you’ll have a system that will direct the queries to both vector and legacy search. Matching will be done individually while ranking will be done across both sets to provide the best results on the Search Engine Results Pages(SERP).\n\nb)Content generation: According to Gartner, by 2026, 80% of the creative roles will be tasked with harnessing GenAI to achieve differentiated results. LLMs make serviceable text quick and cheap. These tools can write blogs, ad copy, web pages, and emails, along with image and video generation. Some of the interesting products in this category include Copy.ai, Jasper, Writer, Anyword, Regie.ai, and Pepper Content.\n\nThe average marketer will be able to ship images and some form of video this year. There will be tools that will be able to ship production-ready images and videos, such as tools like Pika, Runway, Synthesia, and Skippr. Marketers will see the explosion of No Code AI-enabled products to reduce manual labor for creating content.\n\nc)Large language processing: Chatbots will come into the mainstream, providing solutions to your customer support teams as they better interpret and respond to human language. NLP-powered sentiment analysis can also help marketers gauge target customers’ opinions and sentiments toward their brand or campaigns.\n\nd)Customer personalization: LLMs can take everything you know about your customers or similar customers and tailor campaigns and interactions based on behavioral patterns. The outcome: more effective campaigns, happier customers, better campaign results. E.g. Mutiny.\n\nAfter capturing leads, marketers use personalization techniques such as email personalization and outreach. However, with the increasing use of AI in marketing, the question arises: what is true personalization? As AI makes personalized marketing more widespread, it can also make it feel less personal. Consumers may understand that it’s personalized, but they may not feel a personal connection with the brand. By using external data to create personalized content like emails, videos, and web pages, AI can improve post-lead capture conversion rates and reduce costs. However, it may become difficult to increase traffic or leads due to cannibalization of search, as seen in Stack Overflow’s 50% decrease in traffic. This learned behavior may become even more common, with Google potentially accelerating it.\n\ne)Market research and competitive notes: Tweets, online reviews, market research reports, news, and publicly available data sets fed into LLMs will help marketing teams on their research journey. The algorithm can process all of it to give marketers deep insights into consumer trends and sentiment, the competitive landscape, and shifting market opportunities. Tools such as Wokelo.ai offer market research and specific industry insights, reducing the time to market.\n\n2)Adtech/MarkTech Convergence: Traditionally, advertising and marketing teams usually operated separately or are at least not tightly integrated. The ecosystem of tools to manage paid channels was, therefore, different from tools to manage owned channels. To manage paid channels, we have ad servers, exchanges, and social media platforms, and to manage owned channels, we have CRMs, email marketing systems, SEO, etc. This convergence has been largely because Data about potential customers’ intent, interests, and behaviors is scattered ineffectively across multiple solutions used by marketers.\n\nAccording to Google’s latest update, it has been confirmed that starting in 2024, user information will no longer be shared with advertisers. This means that marketers will have to rely solely on first-party data from their website, virtual and in-person events, newsletters, or social media for their cookieless marketing campaigns. Businesses that are not prepared for this will see lesser ROI on their marketing campaigns. This will create a need for platforms that work using AI for intelligent segmenting.\n\nOpen Questions:\n\nAt the core of marketing is data, so let’s think about the data as every SaaS company becomes AI native. Questions that become prominent are — what is the nature and structure of these data? Does that change, and how?\n\nHow would interfaces change? The concept of Product Analytics looks very different in the world if the product interface becomes a chat interface\n\nHow does intelligent segmentation look like? Another version of it is how you can enable people to work with this data using natural language?\n\nWill newcomers compete with incumbents by solving niche use cases? If Yes, then Would they be ingrained in workflows creating strong stickiness around them? or Will they go out of the market as thin wrappers?\n\nData Sources: Snowflake’s modern data stack\n\nIf you found this piece helpful or interesting, don’t hesitate to share it with your network.",
      "# [Dili Aims to Utilize AI for Automated Due Diligence by Joanna Britton on 2024-02-20](https://cbg.com.cy/dili-aims-to-utilize-ai-for-automated-due-diligence/)\nRevolutionizing Due Diligence: How Dili’s AI Platform is Reshaping Investment Strategies\n\nStephanie Song, formerly part of Coinbase’s corporate development and ventures team, knows the grind of daily due diligence tasks all too well. In an email interview with TechCrunch, she expressed her frustration: “Analysts burn the midnight oil working hundreds of hours doing the work that nobody wants to do.” Song, alongside Brian Fernandez and Anand Chaturvedi, ex-colleagues from Coinbase, co-founded Dili, a platform aiming to revolutionize investment due diligence and portfolio management for private equity and VC firms through AI automation.\n\nDisrupting the Norm: Introducing Dili\n\nDili, a graduate of Y Combinator, has secured $3.6 million in venture funding from notable backers like Allianz Strategic Investments and Singularity Capital. Stephanie Song emphasizes the broad impact of AI on investment practices, stating, “[AI] affects all parts of an investment fund, from analysts to partners and back-office functions.” With VCs holding a substantial $311 billion in unspent capital and raising historically low funds, there’s a growing demand for innovative solutions like Dili to optimize investment strategies.\n\nThe Rise of AI in Due Diligence\n\nAI’s role in due diligence is on the rise, with Gartner predicting that by 2025, over 75% of VC and early-stage investor reviews will incorporate AI and data analytics. While Dili isn’t the sole player in this field, Song emphasizes its unique approach, leveraging “first-of-its-kind” technology for high-accuracy tasks like extracting financial metrics from unstructured documents.\n\nTrusting AI in Portfolio Management\n\nHowever, the reliance on AI in decision-making raises concerns about accuracy and biases. Fast Company’s experiment with ChatGPT highlighted potential inaccuracies, while Harvard Business Review’s study revealed biases favouring white and male entrepreneurs in investment decisions. Additionally, some firms may hesitate to entrust sensitive data to third-party AI models due to confidentiality concerns.\n\nAddressing Concerns and Expanding Horizons\n\nTo address these issues, Dili is continually refining its models to enhance accuracy and mitigate biases. Moreover, the platform plans to offer customization options for firms to train models on proprietary data, ensuring data privacy. Despite these challenges, Dili remains optimistic about its potential to unlock untapped opportunities in the private market data landscape.\n\nTowards a Comprehensive Solution",

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on Wokelo\n\n## Company Overview\n\nWokelo is an AI-powered research platform founded in 2022 by Siddhant Masson and Saswat Nanda. The company is headquartered in Seattle, with an office in Bengaluru, India. Wokelo specializes in streamlining the due diligence process by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to produce detailed reports from publicly available data. The platform is designed to enhance the efficiency and speed of data analysis, crucial for activities such as sector research and portfolio monitoring. Wokelo has served over 35 clients, including private equity and venture capital firms, and currently employs 13 people [(KPMG, 2023)](https://kpmg.com/us/en/media/news/kpmg-wokelo-investment-2024.html) [(VCCircle, 2024)](https://www.vccircle.com/zeeinvests-in-flutrr-datazip-three-others-pocket-early-stage-cheques).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Funding and Investment\n\nWokelo recently secured $4 million in seed funding, with participation from KPMG Ventures, Array Ventures, and other investors. This funding will support the further development of its technology and enhance its capabilities in data analysis and intelligence gathering [(KPMG, 2023)](https://kpmg.com/us/en/media/news/kpmg-wokelo-investment-2024.html) [(VCCircle, 2024)](https://www.vccircle.com/zeeinvests-in-flutrr-datazip-three-others-pocket-early-stage-cheques). The investment from KPMG also includes a minority equity stake, which will allow Wokelo to combine its AI-driven insights with KPMG's deal advisory and strategy expertise [(KPMG, 2023)](https://kpmg.com/us/en/media/news/kpmg-wokelo-investment-2024.html).\n\n### Partnerships\n\nThe collaboration with KPMG is significant as it aims to set a new standard in data analysis and intelligence gathering. KPMG's Head of Deal Advisory, Carole Streicher, noted that \"AI is enhancing our approach to both the front-end of dealmaking and post-close integration,\" indicating the strategic importance of this partnership [(KPMG, 2023)](https://kpmg.com/us/en/media/news/kpmg-wokelo-investment-2024.html).\n\n## Product Overview\n\n### Key Features\n\nWokelo's platform is designed to automate and streamline the collection, curation, synthesis, and triangulation of data, delivering client-ready outputs. Key features include:\n\n- **Automated Workflow Design**: Minimizes manual input and maximizes output quality.\n- **Real-Time Analytics**: Provides users with insights into their operations for quick decision-making.\n- **Customizable AI Models**: Allows businesses to tailor AI models to their specific needs.\n- **Integration-Friendly**: Seamlessly integrates with various platforms and services [(Futurepedia, 2024)](https://www.futurepedia.io/tool/wokelo).\n\n### Unique Selling Proposition\n\nWokelo distinguishes itself with its adaptive AI models that can be customized for specific business needs, a feature that is rare in the realm of AI-driven workflow tools. Its robust analytics capabilities enable businesses to automate tasks while gaining deep insights into operational efficiencies [(Futurepedia, 2024)](https://www.futurepedia.io/tool/wokelo).\n\n## Market Position and Competitors\n\nWokelo operates in a competitive landscape that includes other AI-driven platforms focused on due diligence and data analysis, such as Dili, Ansarada, and AlphaSense.
