The company is headquartered in Seattle, Washington, with an additional presence in Bengaluru, India. Wokelo specializes in automating complex research workflows, such as due diligence, sector research, and portfolio monitoring, using its proprietary large language model (LLM)-based technology. This platform is designed to enhance the efficiency and speed of data analysis and intelligence gathering, which is crucial for financial decision-making in sectors like private equity, investment banking, and consulting [(KPMG, 2023)](https://kpmg.com/us/en/media/news/kpmg-wokelo-investment-2024.html).\n\nWokelo has raised a total of $5.5 million in funding since its inception, with notable investors including KPMG Ventures, Array Ventures, and Untapped Capital.

There are companies like DeckMatch that are starting with deck translation and analysis, but that too is a feature Harmonic can easily clone. \n\nMost VCs today use Perplexity, GPT, or [You.com](http://You.com) for free to handle market sizing and support additional competitive analysis, but they're really only looking for a few cut and paste data points to support a decision they've already made to either do a deal or pass... \"According to XYZ industry reports, the ABC market was $XXB in 2022 and expected to grow by some double digit percentage through 2029.\" \n\nThat said, most due dilligence is done talking to customers and prospective buyers, testing the product, and calling SMEs in one's network to gauge the viability and feasibility of the opportunity, which sometimes leads VCs to AlphaSense or AlphaSights or some combination of the two.\n\nAs far as next generation market research tools go, the VCs who are ahead of the curve appear to be using either Wokelo or Velvet, but as you look further up market you run into [www.rogodata.com](http://www.rogodata.com) and Termina.ai. \n\nTo be fair, most funds can't afford the $25K annual spends on Harmonic and Wokelo, or at least they're not yet willing to use these tools to replace an associate, but that still leaves a dozen other tools already in market I haven't even bothered to name.\n\nVCs are only now starting to think about their own internal tooling. Some funds are led by partners who couldnt use technology to save their own lives... like a migration from Microsoft Outlook to Gmail is a heavy lift for them. On top of that this market is small and probably won't support more than $20M-$25M in ARR unless you replace other VC tools like Affinity over time. \n\nI say education, non-profits, and hospitals because these are huge markets with shit products that were forced to embrace tech during COVID. There's less skepticism and resistance now around using new software that make these institutions more efficient and effective. \n\nI often run health pitches by a surgeon friend at Stanford, and the only thing he's gotten excited about so far is a notetaker app... Obviously the regulatory barriers are still high, but the barriers to delighting customers are extremely low. I think there are real pockets of opportunity if you have an internal champion. \n\nSimilarly I have teacher friends who are using off the shelf AI products for almost every aspect of program delivery especially around content. I think you can easily build an AI suite of services around teachers under 40 and see if there isnt an enteprise opportunity you can grow into with internal champions. \n\nInterestingly enough, the non profit and philanthropy ecosystem works very similarly to the VC ecosystem excepts its clunkier and impact focused, but you still have a buyer and seller dynamic between grant makers and grantees that's similar to VC and startups. There are also nonprofit databases you can crawl and build analytics on top to help grant makers source and vet nonprofits more efficiently and effectively. You could probably start with either a grant-writing tool or a grant assessment tool that screens out applications that are \"not a good fit for the fund.\"\n\n## Comment ID l61uyvp with +2 score by [(Main_Effective7448, Reddit, 2024-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/venturecapital/comments/1d2mctd/market_research_tool_for_vcs_and_other_investors/l61uyvp/) (in reply to ID 1d2mctd):\npm'd\n\n## Comment ID l620el4 with +2 score by [(shmaylob, Reddit, 2024-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/venturecapital/comments/1d2mctd/market_research_tool_for_vcs_and_other_investors/l620el4/) (in reply to ID 1d2mctd):\nWhat kind of sources does your AI have?

I used Aurora to get a grip on my TAM and SAM - saved me a ton of time. \n\nIf you're looking to make market research easier, I'd say focus on the specific pain points of your target users.

      "# [The rapid experimentation of AI agents by Kathryn Chubb on 2024-06-09](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/rapid-experimentation-ai-agents)\nThis post first appeared in The Analytics Engineering Roundup.\n\nYohei Nakajima is an investor by day and coder by night. In his day job, he invests in early stage companies as a general partner at Untapped Capital. As a hacker, he's been focused of late on the applications of AI.\n\nIn particular, one of his projects, called BabyAGI, got a ton of attention about a year ago. BabyAGI is an AI agent framework, creating a plan-execute loop. If you give it a goal, it will create a plan to achieve this goal, and then go execute on this plan. All of this plays out in a long chain of LLM API calls, and you can observe every step along the way.\n\nThe truth is that this is an extremely experimental space, and depending on how strict you want to be with your definition, there aren't a lot of production use cases to point to today of AI agents. When you watch the demo videos on Yohei's Twitter feed, you can immediately see the promise.\n\nListen & subscribe from:\n\nSpotify\n\nApple Podcasts\n\nGoogle Podcasts\n\nStitcher\n\nTuneIn\n\nRSS feed\n\nKey takeaways from this episode.\n\nWhat do you spend your time on these days?\n\nYohei Nakajima: I'm a VC by day, builder by night. It's always been a hobby I've always had on my side. I've never been an engineer by trade, but I've been coding as a hobby since high school. And I became more of a no-coder for a while, just because with the limited time to build, no-code was easier. But when I started using AI, I realized that I could pump out some pretty cool code in a matter of two to three hours, so I switched back to code about a year after I started using OpenAI. That's where all my GitHub projects come from.\n\nDo you want to take a minute to plug a company or two that you've invested in recently, for the audience to see what you're seeing on the VC side?\n\nOne of the tools that I use every day, which is the easiest plug, is a company called Wokelo.ai. They do AI research and due diligence. When I'm interested in a company, I can just type in the company name and click Generate Report. Thirty minutes later, I get a 20-50 page report that includes market insights, recent news, competitors, management profiles, all that kind of stuff. It really is the kind of work you’d ask analysts to do and it’d take them two weeks to do, but it's in 30 minutes.\n\nBased on the deal flow that you're seeing, what are some underreported things that will be true about the world in two or three years that no one's paying attention to?\n\nI've done a couple of talks on autonomous agents, and one of the things that gets more of a reaction is the idea of an agent who is a CEO. When people think about AI right now, you imagine AI at the bottom of the rung. But an example I give is Amazon Mechanical Turk or Upwork. These are technology platforms that help you manage people. And now imagine taking this capability of LLMs and rebuilding something like an Amazon Mechanical Turk.\n\nYou can imagine how you could build an agent that can manage a college ambassador program and that AI can do that more efficiently than a human, in theory. If you extend that, then why can't you have a CEO who's available 24-7, has access to every single piece of data in the company, can take feedback from every single employee and synthesize it, and has bias that's at least measurable and transparent, so you can adjust it, versus wondering if they're being unfair.\n\nOne of our values as a company is we move up the stack. It's an invitation to always replace yourself. And if there is a very effective AI CEO, I'm ready.\n\nThe initial idea around BabyAGI was to prototype an autonomous startup founder.\n\nI think AI is far from being able to build an innovative startup that becomes a unicorn. But if we pick something that's a little bit more straightforward and purely digital, like an e-commerce dropshipping business, I think it's within reach to build an AI system that can run and manage something like that.\n\nTell us about BabyAGI. What is it? And what have people built with it?\n\nI think the reason BabyAGI went viral was at that point, ChatGPT was still relatively new. People were still building on top of that chat interface. BabyAGI was one of the first popular open-source projects to loop in LLM.\n\nI added some capabilities so when you're given an objective, I’d first have a task list creation agent to generate a task list based on that objective. And then I would use code to parse that out. And then send each task one by one to an execution agent to execute that.\n\nWhen I was generating new tasks, I had a task prioritization agent, which would review past results and update the task list. It would then check for the most similar tasks first, so that it would try to generate new kind of tasks. And what happens when you press run, build a business, it would just come up with things to do.\n\nAt this point it was just LLM calls; it was just generating tasks. But when I asked it to start a business—I need a marketing plan, I need to build a website, I need to come up with product ideas—it just kept going one by one on, like we do around building a business.\n\nThis has become commonly referred to as an agent, this idea that there's an AI that operates in a loop and it plans and it executes, and it can to a certain extent take actions in the real world. I think this is not a new idea, but it is an idea that maybe it's time has come. Is that a fair way to think about it?\n\nI agree. It's not a new idea to let a software program autonomously run. I think with LLM capabilities you could finally get it to reason, do similarity search, and do it in a way that was much more robust.\n\nCan you talk at all about agent architectures? Are there better and worse ways to construct agents?\n\nWhen new technology emerges, there's a period of rapid experimentation. If you look at old cars, there are three-wheeled cars, there are steam-engine cars.\n\nBut if you look today, a lot of the cars or phones, they all look the same today. With autonomous agents, we're in the rapid experimentation phase, where there's a whole bunch of different frameworks, a whole bunch of different architectures, a whole bunch of different approaches.\n\nIt's hard to say which one's going to stick, but ultimately there’ll be some consolidation. So I think it helps if you're thinking about architecture, just look at them each one by one. Task planning is probably one of the main ones. The two major ways is the react style, which is to do one thing at a time and reflect on it. And then there's the BabyAGI style—plan and execute—which is generate a task list first and then go through them.\n\nBut of course there's a fuzzy line because you can generate a task list first and then reflect on each result to update the task list. It's not one or the other.\n\nHow should we think about where we will see agents impacting our lives first?\n\nI think about it in three buckets. I think of the first bucket as what I call handcrafted agents, where you are writing each problem. And you're chaining it specifically with API calls and it's a very specific flow. Some people would call that not autonomous because it's a human generating the task list and you're not AI running it autonomously. That being said, with the idea of Wokelo, if I can give an AI a company and it's going to give me back a 30-50 page report, from a usage standpoint, it feels very autonomous to me.\n\nAnd then there's what I call the specialized agent, which is the I think where it becomes truly autonomous, it's dynamically generating its own task list or recursively figuring out what to do, but it's within a specific set of skills and tools. So you can imagine a coding-specialized agent for a VC specialization that just knows how to look up CrunchBase.\n\nAnd then there's the general-purpose, fully generalized autonomous agent.\n\nHandcrafted agents are useful today. I mean, Wokelo is one specific example, but I know many companies that are doing handcrafted agents. This is humans generating the task list and they're charging lots of money with low churn, and they're creating value.\n\nWith specialized agents, what I'm seeing right now is pretty interesting demos with a lot of promise. These companies are raising capital; they're starting to have conversations with enterprises because they're interested, and they are starting to line up pilots because these companies are willing to test it.\n\nBut I haven't seen anything that's blowing me away in terms of reliability and value creation.\n\nAnd then when it comes to general automation, I haven't seen anything remotely close to reliable. I also don't think of them as three fully separate buckets, but actually more of starting here and slowly moving to there.\n\nCan you talk at all about why agent designers switch between different models for different tasks?\n\nDifferent models have different strengths is the shortest answer. Some models are better than others at writing code. Some models are better than others at writing long pieces in an eloquent manner. And it's constantly shifting.\n\nDevelopers are looking at the cost, the speed, and the quality of each model, and when I say quality, specific to the use case. So with an agent system, you have parts that need to write code, parts that need to respond to the user, so depending on the specific need you're swapping out models to see which one is optimal.\n\nNow that language models can write code, can formulate their outputs and inputs as JSON or other structured data, is there any particular limit on what types of actions they could take in the world?\n\nThe first thing that popped to mind was anything that requires a physical body will be hard for a digital agent to do unless you give them the robotic parts to do so, but again, I wouldn't say that's a limit, like we can build the robotic parts and we can give them division capabilities and we can do those things.\n\nWhat's so interesting to me is messaging. Are there agents in the world today that are connected to the Twilio API or to SMTP and sending emails? Yeah,\n\nDefinitely. There are tons of emails that are automatically sent. But I think the question you're asking is, are there any that are fully dynamically managing it on its own? Probably.\n\nDo you think that most AI workflows are going to be created by software engineers? Or because the capabilities of AI are so powerful in the realm of writing code, are they actually going to be created by less technical folks who are closer to the business?\n\nThis is a little bit more of a hypothesis. I don't know is the short answer, but I would guess, based on my experience building it, that you need a really good core framework, and that has to be built by the engineers. And the whole point of the framework should really be around a good agent should be one that the more you use it, the better it gets.\n\nIn the future, when you say, who's building the task list, I don't think it's the engineers. It's the users who are going to ask an AI to do something, and then when an AI doesn't do it the right way, it'll give it guidance, and the AI will remember how to do it that way and keep you getting better.\n\nThe engineers will be building essentially how the brain works itself, but just like how you and I have gotten better at things, the AI is going to get better by working for somebody and getting feedback from that person.\n\nWhat do you hope is true about the data or in this case, the AI space in five years?",

However, that very month, the company unveiled a chatbot, ChatGPT, which in just two months crossed 100 Mn monthly active users, making it the fastest-growing consumer platform in history.\n\nMeet The GenAI Startups Putting India On The Global AI Map\n\n1. Observe AI\n\nFounded in 2017 by Sharath Keshava Narayana and Swapnil Jain, Observe AI is a conversational intelligence platform for contact centres.\n\nObserve.AI has raised a total of $214 Mn in funding over 6 rounds. It bagged 125 Mn in its last funding round in 2022.\n\nThe platform is supported by marquee investors such as Zoom, Bossanova Investimentos, Y Combinator, Menlo Ventures, and Nexus Venture Partners. It competes with the likes of companies like Noogata, TUNGEE, Osense Technology, Slang Labs, etc.\n\n2. Pixis\n\nFounded in 2020 by Harikrishna Valiyath, Shubham A Mishra, Vrushali Prasade, Pixis provides a codeless AI infrastructure platform for brands to monitor and orchestrate their marketing campaigns.\n\nSince its inception, the startup has raised $209 Mn in capital. It raised $85 Mn in its last funding round in 2023.\n\nPixis is backed by startups like Grupo Carso, General Atlantic, Celesta Capital and Chiratae Ventures. It competes with the likes of Utilidata, HeadSpin, and Navikenz in the larger AI-powered technology space.\n\n3. Ola Krutrim\n\nFounded in 2022 by Ola and Ola Electric founder Bhavish Aggarwal, Krutrim is experimenting with GenAI to develop an India-specific LLM. The startup’s family of LLMs is said to be capable of working with 10 Indian languages. However, Krutrim has yet to release any publicly-available products.\n\nUnveiling future plans for Krutrim at its annual event in August 2024, Aggarwal announced plans to develop India’s first homegrown family of chips for AI, general compute and Edge. The unicorn has deployed DeepSeek’s R1 671B on Nvidia’s H100 graphics processing units in India and also hosted its AI models on its cloud platform.\n\nThe startup made headlines in January 2024 when it became the first pure-play AI startup in India to hit a unicorn valuation over its recent $50 Mn funding round. So far, it has secured $74 Mn in funding, becoming one of the most well-funded AI startups in the country, from backers such as Z47.\n\nThe startup competes with the likes of Sarvam AI, Mistral AI, and DeepMind.\n\n4. InVideo\n\nFounded in 2019 by Sanket Shah, and later joined by Anshul Khandelwal, InVideo initially operated a web-based video editing platform that allowed users to convert existing pieces of static content into videos.\n\nHowever, it has come a long way since then. Currently, the startup operates a full-fledged AI-powered video editing platform that leverages GenAI to create videos with just text prompts.

      "# [How GenAI Is Transforming Indian Enterprises—From Assistants to Infrastructure by Entrepreneur Staff on 2025-03-26](https://www.entrepreneur.com/en-in/news-and-trends/genai-for-indian-languages-and-inclusivity/489080)\nIndia's Generative AI (GenAI) revolution is gaining serious momentum, not just as a technological trend but as a full-fledged enabler of enterprise transformation. According to the India's Generative AI Startup Landscape 2024 report, India's GenAI startup base has grown 3.6X from H1 CY2023 to H1 CY2024, spanning across infrastructure, applications, and services. The growth has been broad-based: more than 17 Indic and vertical models have been launched, there's been a 4X rise in GenAI assistants, and GenAI service startups have surged by 4.6X. Though funding has primarily been concentrated in early-stage rounds, the innovation wave is spreading beyond established hubs to newer regions, underlining India's strong intent to harness GenAI across sectors.\n\nThis surge isn't just limited to startups. Enterprises, too, are quickly moving from experimental to full-scale deployment of GenAI.\n\nAnkush Sabharwal, Founder of CoRover, explained how GenAI has moved far beyond just customer-facing chatbots. \"Yes, the low-hanging fruit of any Gen-AI is customer experience,\" he said. \"But now, banks use our product 'Coronotifier' for real-time monitoring of critical systems like UPI and FASTag. We've expanded from customer engagement to internal operations, lead conversions, and even AI-powered transactions.\" He noted that clients typically evolve with their AI journey: \"Some begin with one use case and move on to four or more. A few get impatient, but we recommend parallel A/B testing. Eventually, everyone agrees GenAI helps them convert more and serve better.\"\n\nGanesh Gopalan, Co-Founder and CEO of Gnani.ai, emphasised the growing relevance of small language models (SLMs), particularly for sectors like BFSI. \"Instead of multi-billion parameter models, we use SLMs—ours is about 3 billion parameters. These offer low latency and high accuracy, which is essential for real-time applications like voice AI agents and agent assist tools,\" Ganesh said. He also stressed the importance of regional and linguistic nuance in India's diverse landscape. \"We've built India's first automatic speech recognition systems for multiple Indian languages by collecting hundreds of thousands of hours of audio with demographic representation,\" he explained.\n\nSiddhant Masson, Co-founder & CEO of Wokelo.ai, shared how their LLM-powered investment research platform leverages a mix of open and closed source models. \"Initially, it was just OpenAI's GPT. Now, we use a mixture-of-experts model, combining OpenAI, Anthropic, and open-source models depending on the task,\" he said. This flexible architecture helps deliver high-fidelity research outputs across a variety of complex microtasks, from synthesis to insight generation. He noted that many enterprises are increasingly inclined to host open-source models privately due to data concerns. \"Open source makes that possible. And as models like DeepSeek rise to closed-source performance benchmarks, the push for data sovereignty becomes even stronger.\"\n\nThat push is echoed passionately by Ankush. \"We need sovereign AI. Data should be from India, trained in India, deployed in India. If a global crisis cuts communication, we shouldn't be left stranded using foreign LLMs,\" he asserted. He raised concerns about copyright misuse, synthetic data, and AI models trained on questionable datasets. \"Why are we taking copyrighted data to build businesses? People need to ask which data the model was trained on—not just where it's being hosted.\"\n\nBut even as the use cases grow and the ecosystem matures, many enterprises remain cautious. Clear regulation is the missing piece. \"Companies are ready to invest, but they don't know whether voice cloning or video cloning is permissible. What's our stance on deepfakes?\" Ankush asked. \"We need enforceable laws, not just guidelines.\" Ganesh agreed, pointing to global debates on AI regulation and noting that clarity breeds confidence. \"Once the framework is clear, adoption will follow.\" Siddhant added that apart from policy, what India truly needs is investment in homegrown research labs: \"We need labs building SLMs for India. Otherwise, AI will become too geopolitically concentrated,\" he concluded.",

Custom-built models, tailored specifically for each organization and focused on proposal development, seamlessly integrate into every workflow. These models embed the organization's capabilities and brand voice throughout the content creation process, resulting in timely delivery of high-quality outcomes.

      "# [5 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks and ETFs to Buy Now by U.S. News & World Report on 2025-03-05](https://wtop.com/news/2025/03/5-best-nuclear-energy-stocks-and-etfs-to-buy-now-6/)\nOne of the consequences of the boom in artificial intelligence is the need for more electricity. The data centers that house the computers that crunch the numbers gobble up a lot of power.\n\nA recent report from the U.S. Department of Energy estimates data center load growth has tripled over the past decade and will double or triple by 2028. The department said data centers consumed about 4.4% of total U.S. electricity in 2023 and will consume about 6.7% to 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028.\n\n[Sign up for stock news with our Invested newsletter.]\n\nCouple that with rising demand for the electrification of transportation and other parts of the economy and you’ve got a recipe for rising electricity demand at a time when governments around the world are looking to transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nThat’s the basic long-term investment case for nuclear power, which can create stable electricity without emitting greenhouse gases: It’s increasing in demand as governments look for low-carbon, secure sources of energy. But while the future looks bright, short-term geopolitics are creating a cloud of uncertainty over the market.\n\n“The central source of uncertainty has been the frequent changes and delays in the Trump administration’s tariff policies, which have distracted utilities from normal procurement activities,” Jacob White, ETF product manager at Sprott Asset Management, which offers uranium funds, said in a recent blog post.\n\nBut that uncertainty may clear up relatively quickly.\n\n“It looks unlikely that uranium tariffs will last for long,” says Igor Isaev, head of the Analytics Center at European broker Mind Money. “As long as there is a shortage of energy and consumption is growing at rates greater than gas and green energy can satisfy, uranium will be in demand and attractive for investment.”\n\nThe uncertainty has helped pressure prices for uranium, a key part of the nuclear fuel supply chain. This isn’t great for companies that mine the metal, but it may also provide an entry point for buy-and-hold investors who think the metal will rally.\n\n“At about $65 per pound, uranium’s current spot price weakness presents a potentially attractive entry opportunity for investors who can weather near-term turbulence,” White says.\n\nThat brings us back to the longer-term view.\n\n“Nuclear energy is increasingly looking like an alternative energy source for electricity in the long run,” says Sankar Sharma, CEO of investing education website RiskRewardReturn.com. “With AI companies demanding more green and sustainable energy, nuclear energy appears to be the best alternative.”\n\nHere are some nuclear energy stocks and funds to consider, with their one-year total return as of March 13:\n\nStock 1-Year Performance Cameco Corp. (ticker: CCJ) +6.0% Centrus Energy Corp. (LEU) +86.1% NuScale Power Corp. (SMR) +114.8% VanEck Uranium and Nuclear ETF (NLR) +4.0% Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (OTC: SRUUF) -29.4%*\n\n*10-year annualized total daily return is 12.3%.\n\nCameco Corp. (CCJ)\n\nUranium, the linchpin of the nuclear fuel cycle, must be mined. While many small mining companies have been ramping up uranium production and exploration, they can be quite risky, although their upside can be quite substantial.\n\nIn contrast, Cameco is the world’s second-biggest miner of uranium, which means the company is less risky than exploration companies that aren’t yet in production.\n\nCameco has investments across the nuclear fuel cycle, including ownership interests in a nuclear technology equipment manufacturer and a laser uranium enrichment technology company. So, the company is benefiting from robust uranium supply deals and rising demand.\n\nLike other mining companies, Cameco is subject to price movements of the commodity it produces, which can be volatile.\n\nInvestors who are interested in the uranium mining sector but want to spread out the risk can consider the Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM) for bigger miners and Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNJ) for smaller players.\n\nCentrus Energy Corp. (LEU)\n\nCurrent large reactors use low-enriched uranium to produce electricity. Advanced reactors and more than half of designs for an emerging technology called small modular reactors in development use a more concentrated form of uranium called high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU), according to the World Nuclear Association.\n\nCentrus is the only company in the U.S. with a license to make HALEU, and it has been producing small quantities.\n\nWith this license and manufacturing experience, Centrus is well positioned to make the fuel for a growing number of advanced reactors, small modular reactors and micro reactors. HALEU can also be used in conventional reactors.\n\nNuScale Power Corp. (SMR)\n\nOne of the U.S. Department of Energy’s goals is to foster a domestic or friendly-nation supply chain for low-enriched uranium for current reactors and the next generation of nuclear technologies. Part of that future will include small modular nuclear reactors like those NuScale designs and markets.\n\nThe company says its pressurized water reactors can generate 77 megawatts of electricity each and can be scaled up to more than 900 megawatts. The design is smaller than a traditional nuclear reactor and can be used to replace retiring coal plants and provide baseload power.\n\nNuScale has U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission certification for one of its designs, giving it a foothold in the emerging nuclear renaissance.\n\nAlthough the company has lost money amid ongoing research and development, NuScale is progressing toward commercialization with cost-saving measures, says Siddhant Masson, CEO of investment research platform company Wokelo AI.\n\n[Read: Best Marijuana Stocks to Buy.]\n\nVanEck Uranium and Nuclear ETF (NLR)\n\nInvestors who want to spread out the risk with a more diversified investment than single stocks can consider exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, which trade under a single ticker symbol but contain many stocks.\n\nThis ETF invests in uranium mining companies; companies that build, engineer, and maintain nuclear power facilities and reactors; companies involved in the production of electricity from nuclear sources; and companies that provide equipment, technology or services to the nuclear power industry.\n\nThis fund has an expense ratio of 0.61%, or $61 per year for every $10,000 invested.\n\nThe fund includes utilities, which can give it a defensive tinge. Utilities are unlikely to outperform growth stocks during times of economic expansion and stock market optimism. But when the tide turns and economic uncertainty increases, utilities can act as a portfolio cushion because houses and businesses need electricity year-round, regardless of economic conditions.\n\nAs the nuclear renaissance gains steam, more utilities may expand their nuclear footprints.\n\nLast year, utility Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG) said it would restart a unit at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, with Microsoft agreeing to purchase energy from the revived plant to power its data centers.\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust (OTC: SRUUF)\n\nInvestors who want to express a view on the price of uranium itself without having to do it through mining companies can turn to this fund. The trust invests most of its assets in uranium in the form of triuranium octoxide (U3O8) and is the world’s biggest physical uranium fund.\n\nIn a market where much of the trading happens between private parties, the fund offers transparency.\n\n“Nuclear energy, especially uranium, has played a key role among the renewable energy sources due to its efficiency, sustainability and lower carbon footprint than fossil fuel sources like coal, oil and gas,” Sharma says.\n\nMore from U.S. News\n\n5 of the Best Stocks to Buy Now\n\n10 of the Best Bank Stocks to Buy for 2025\n\n10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for 2025\n\n5 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks and ETFs to Buy Now originally appeared on usnews.com\n\nUpdate 03/14/25: This story was previously published at an earlier date and has been updated with new information."
