      "# Post ID ae4n5j: The song played during the orgy scene in Eyes Wide Shut with +45 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/ae4n5j/the_song_played_during_the_orgy_scene_in_eyes/)\nHi guys, I have recently learned that during the orgy scene, the song playing in the background (Jocelyn Pook-Migrations) has a verse of the holy scripture of Hinduism playing in the background.\n\nAfter the Hindu community protested, Warner Brothers removed the chanting and re-recorded the song to not include it, and now it just sounds vaguely Indian.\n\nMost movie versions of the song have had the words of the chant edited out, but the YouTube versions still have the original words of the scripture, which are the following \n\nparitranaya sadhunam\nvinasaya ca duskrtam\ndharma-samsthapanarthaya\nsambhavami yuge yuge\n\n“For the protection of the virtuous, for the destruction\nof the evil and for the firm establishment of Dharma (righteousness),\nI take birth and am incarnated on Earth, from age to age.” \n-Krishna, Bhaghavad Gita: chapter 4 verse 8\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xFIJ05AXAvE\n\nWhy would the team include this in the movie do you think? Was it intentional or was it just randomly taken from Hindu scriptures?\n\n\nEDIT: I acknowledge that this song offended the Hindu community, but the purpose of this post is to find out if there was an particular reason that  Hindu holy scripture was played during the occult ritual scene in the movie \n\n## Comment ID edqwk9i with +16 score by [(sublime-affinity, Reddit, 2019-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/ae4n5j/the_song_played_during_the_orgy_scene_in_eyes/edqwk9i/) (in reply to ID ae4n5j):\nPook's piece, Masked Ball, features the words/lyrics sung backwards, which is to say, the music track is being played IN REVERSE during the obscene Somerton ritual (is diegetic to the film ie is being played within the scene itself by one of the characters/Nick Nightingale; whereas Pook's Migrations is non-diegetic, is a soundtrack external to the scenes), a clear indication via the soundtrack that the wealthy-corrupt Somerton elite being portrayed in the film are a sacrilegious cabal, are a total mockery of all or any religion, are capitalist nihilists. Kubrick, via the film, is CRITIQUING that corrupt elite, satirizing it, not endorsing it, just as he was critiquing Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange when his reading of the Bible while he was in prison provoked him to fantasize being a Roman soldier enjoying torturing-whipping Jesus as he carried his cross. And recall that ultra-conservative Christian reactionaries aggressively protested about those scenes at the time of the film's release in 1971/72, just as would later happen with Monty Python's Life of Brian, Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, Godard's Hail Mary  (and later, in literary fiction, Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, him being 'awarded' with a fatwa on his life).  It is truly bizarre & tragic (and disturbing) that audiences can no longer make such elementary distinctions in a film or novel (eg between the ethos and/or emotional ethic of characters in a film and the underlying or framing ethos of the film itself). Such hysterical delirium would be like Jewish people objecting to Spielberg's Schindler's List or Polanski's The Pianist (and numerous other Holocaust films) as being insensitive, blasphemous and pro-Nazi because those films openly and directly portray Jews being murdered by Nazis. A naïve and literal, crackpot empiricism.\n\n### Comment ID epvf4zs with +2 score by [(DanaAndrews, Reddit, 2019-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/ae4n5j/the_song_played_during_the_orgy_scene_in_eyes/epvf4zs/) (in reply to ID edqwk9i):\nyeah yeah. we've heard it all before, the cliche that it's ALWAYS Christians who complain. but dude, um, I think the liberals complained about Clockwork Orange more than anyone, and STILL do. they invented Political Correctness, after all.\n\n#### Comment ID k15kr5r with +6 score by [(Downtown_Motor_4274, Reddit, 2023-09-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/ae4n5j/the_song_played_during_the_orgy_scene_in_eyes/k15kr5r/) (in reply to ID epvf4zs):\nPolitical Correctness was invented by Reagan to smear his political opponents.

Yes, the film ACO is centrally a caustic critique and pessimistic satire of Liberalism, but as liberalism and conservatism are really flip sides of the same coin, of the same underlying ideology, both groups' responses - or at least some of those identifying with such groups - to the film were somewhat reactionary and hysterical.\n\n#### Comment ID m32uijn with +1 score by [(Emergency-Impress948, Reddit, 2024-12-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/ae4n5j/the_song_played_during_the_orgy_scene_in_eyes/m32uijn/) (in reply to ID epvf4zs):\nChristians cry over coffee cups 😅\n\n#### Comment ID mae13uf with +1 score by [(Strict-Vast-9640, Reddit, 2025-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/ae4n5j/the_song_played_during_the_orgy_scene_in_eyes/mae13uf/) (in reply to ID epvf4zs):\nSorry I got here 5 years too late. I wanted to touch upon something the OP said. \nHere in the UK when a movie is entered for its certification, there is a Priest sat in, who is sat in judgement over filmmakers.\n\nIt's only my opinion but I think that is wrong. No official religious figures should be able to sit in and judge whether a film is fit for public consumption.\n\nMovie historians and cultural experts yes, because we have to have an age guide on movies, but to have a member of the church sat in is ridiculous.\n\nLike I say, I do agree that age appropriate guides should be on movies whilst in distribution. I've yet to hear a convincing argument as to why Christians (or other representatives from any other religions) need be present when giving a movie an age certificate. \n\nThere are more none Christians in the world than there are Christians. Why must we be subjected to your personal belief system. \nIt's wrong.\n\n### Comment ID m1d2sal with +1 score by [(Evangelion217, Reddit, 2024-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/ae4n5j/the_song_played_during_the_orgy_scene_in_eyes/m1d2sal/) (in reply to ID edqwk9i):\nAudiences have always done this with high art. The negative reactions, massive denial of their brilliance, and then after a decade or two, it becomes accepted as a grand achievement. And then it’s reappraised, rewatched and then objectively judged as something that will stand the test of time.\n\nAnd many of Kubrick’s films have done through this. Even his box office hits have gone through this, with maybe two exceptions.\n\n### Comment ID kaxkhsh with +1 score by [(Wedwarfredwoods, Reddit, 2023-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/ae4n5j/the_song_played_during_the_orgy_scene_in_eyes/kaxkhsh/) (in reply to ID edqwk9i):\nYou believe there are direct statements about class and capitalism made by this film?

I can’t imagine he would have intentionally used anything that would have proven to be so sensitive.  I think it’s down to her original artistic choices really. She probably thought it was cool thing to do and hadn’t thought about the consequences. If there’s anyone here that knows different I’m sure they will quote chapter and verse at you.\n\n### Comment ID edraxh6 with +4 score by [(sublime-affinity, Reddit, 2019-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/ae4n5j/the_song_played_during_the_orgy_scene_in_eyes/edraxh6/) (in reply to ID edmfw3g):\nBut isn't all this implying that the 'criticisms', the taking offence (by some extreme pseudo-religious and intolerant pressure group), to Pook's music piece in the film, was legitimate (rather than an unhinged, ignorant, knee-jerk and reactionary response, much like all those extremist groups who took 'offence' to A Clockwork Orange)? Isn't it implying - insinuating - that it was Jocelyn Pook who was being 'insensitive' (whatever that could even mean in this context) for having composed such a song in the first place, and that she then, as \"evil Jocelyn\" -  'misled' the innocent babe-in-the-woods, butter-wouldn't-melt-in-his mouth cluelessly naive Kubrick who selects tracks for his films without even bothering to read, interpret or translate the lyrics? These tracks, like Migrations, were composed and released prior to the film being released, which is how Kubrick came to learn about them. The point, as argued in another post below/above, is that the track isn't being used 'insensitively' in the film. On the contrary ... it is used with a clear understanding by Kubrick both of the song and of how it relates to the scenes that it accompanies.\n\n### Comment ID edn1rb7 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/ae4n5j/the_song_played_during_the_orgy_scene_in_eyes/edn1rb7/) (in reply to ID edmfw3g):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID ednc0uq with +2 score by [(kck2018, Reddit, 2019-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/ae4n5j/the_song_played_during_the_orgy_scene_in_eyes/ednc0uq/) (in reply to ID edn1rb7):\nI expect he relied on Pooks judgment on this.

I literally had no competition for most of my school life, I can count the kids who were very close or on the same level on one hand. I went to school in villages and in a town, one village being poor, so there were no speakers, the other village being somewhat town-like had the most competition, until I moved schools in a town where I went to highschool. In this town I did my last 2 years of middle school, where I had only one dude who was doing ok, and highschool which was the most competitive (with my bff and a small group of dudes being good to fluent and all self taught), which is crazy because my highschool was one of those \"bad\" ones. So, I guess I got lucky to be surrounded by people I could practice my speech with? I created problems for the 8th grade teacher by knowing too much, so you can imagine how bad teachers can be if students surpass them by 8th grade with no superior studies or help.\n\nTalking about online, it would seem that there's more people who speak English because you're surrounded by an English speaking community, and that distorts the reality that many Romanians still can't speak English. As a kinda ex-kpop fan, the kpop communities in Romania know lots of English, most of them are efficient or fluent. The anime community is a mixed bag, cuz I've seen and met anime fans who don't know English at all waiting for ro subs. The gaming community tends to go from ok to fluent. The other fandoms I'm in tend to be international, and unless the person has their name or a username in Romanian, you wouldn't notice them. But while I go out, there might be only a few teens who can speak English.\n\nKeep in mind, irl some English speaking Romanians will be self consciouns and would avoid speaking if they can (since they're comfortably in Romania). I remember some foreigners visiting my town middle school and wanted a few kids to introduce themselves, my friends encouraged me, but I didn't do it, and neither did the dude. I kinda regret passing that opportunity up.\n\n#### Comment ID lm9vjs3 with +1 score by [(Secure-Pride-9575, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/romanian/comments/145bg3b/is_romanian_really_a_useless_language_does/lm9vjs3/) (in reply to ID jnkgcrv):\nYes, because they were learning French then.\n\n#### Comment ID jp2bal1 with +1 score by [(yoyorogyrl, Reddit, 2023-06-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/romanian/comments/145bg3b/is_romanian_really_a_useless_language_does/jp2bal1/) (in reply to ID jnkgcrv):\nIt is both generational and geographical.

Plus because of the lack of education, some Romanians will go abroad and behave horrible, and will create a bad rep for the \"good romanians\" who will most likely fully adopt the new culture and language of that place so they would appear as non Romanians.

The lifestyle here feels like a suicide for me as an introvert. A few months ago I was determined to save money and go back to my home country, Romania. The only reasons I'm still here is that I can travel a lot since Deutschland ticket was introduced and have a great team at work. And health system and German seriosity. But other than that, life here feels sterile and making friends feels like mission impossible ( not shitting on Germany, just sharing my personal experience where being an introvert is probably an important factor).\n\nI miss the landscapes from home, the food, the weather, people's warmth, but I hate the \"balcanic\" influences we have and the fact that we're still behind Western Europe from an economical point of view. \n\nProblem is that I'm in my late 30s and I feel like I don't have the same zest I had when I was younger, like when I moved to Germany for ex. And if I keep postponing it, I'll end up old and alone in a foreign country where I never felt at home. I'm aware that going back home won't solve all my problems and I also might have a reverse culture shock.\n\nWould love to hear your take if you're going or went through something similar. And what helped you make a decision.\n\n## Comment ID kx4aj2e with +18 score by [(CuriosTiger, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1bqotju/do_you_think_its_possible_to_be_happy_again_in/kx4aj2e/) (in reply to ID 1bqotju):\nIt depends on what your home country is. I'm not that familiar with Romania, but as far as I'm aware, plenty of people lead happy lives in Romania.\n\nI think what you've discovered is that material wealth and economic performance are not sufficient to make you happy. And this is a fallacy I see in this subreddit over and over again, where people look at economic indicators and statistics to decide where to live, while completely overlooking intangibles such as a social life.\n\nIt's hard to make friends in Germany. Even for Germans. Most friendship bonds are formed in childhood, and meeting new friends as adults is challenging. This is not just your perception, this is the reality of German culture. It's not impossible, but it takes a real effort, and it's harder if you're an introvert to begin with.\n\n\"Reverse culture shock\" and \"reverse homesickness\" are real phenomena. Regardless of where you choose to live, Romania and Germany will always be different, and they'll also both be changing. But they don't have stop you from being happy.\n\nIf I choose to return to Norway in the future, there are things I will certainly miss from the United States. And living in the United States as an immigrant, there are things I miss from Norway. I'm happy either way, but I also visit Norway about once a year, and I stay in touch with friends and family there by social media, Facetime or good old-fashioned phone calls.\n\nI felt homesickness the most intensely my first year in the United States. I was here as a high school exchange student. I was not unhappy; as the exotic \"foreign kid\" I was way more popular at school than I was at home, and I had a nice host family. I'm glad I went, but man, I missed my parents. Subsequently, moving to the US for college, then work, then love, I still had moments when I missed one thing or another about Norway, but the emotional impact lessened over time, and it was tempered by the friends I've made and the experiences I've had here in the United States, which would not be possible in Norway.\n\nIf I move back to Norway now, the same is bound to happen in reverse. And my coping mechanisms would be the same. Of course, there are also other things I'd miss, from warm weather to cheap fuel to 2-day Amazon deliveries. But there's no country on earth where I can have all the pros with none of the cons. If there were, that'd be paradise.\n\nI still may choose to move back to Norway eventually. Health care becomes increasingly important as I age, and Norway has a better health care system than the United States does (at least for normal people who are not independently wealthy.) There are times when I literally \"pine for the fjords\". Perhaps I'll retire in Norway. I don't know.\n\nI do know that I can be happy in either country, because I've been happy in both before. If you're unhappy in Germany specifically, moving back to Romania may be the right choice for you. On the other hand, if you were unhappy before you moved to Germany, then therapy rather than relocation may yield better results.\n\n## Comment ID kx4h93b with +15 score by [(DruidWonder, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1bqotju/do_you_think_its_possible_to_be_happy_again_in/kx4h93b/) (in reply to ID 1bqotju):\nYes it's possible, but you will see your home country differently than people who live there who never left. That makes it kind of lonely in a way. And if you see things about your home country that become unbearable, it makes it even harder to be happier there. One of the most shocking things about reverse culture shock for me was that people in my home country were totally blind to some of the horrible things going on that were very obvious from an outsider's perspective. \n\n\nOn the whole I'm glad I traveled and lived overseas so that at least I know the choice I am making.\n\n### Comment ID kx55hqu with +3 score by [(by-the-willows, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1bqotju/do_you_think_its_possible_to_be_happy_again_in/kx55hqu/) (in reply to ID kx4h93b):\nWhere are you from if I may ask?\n\n## Comment ID kx4ylvr with +5 score by [(txcliffy, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1bqotju/do_you_think_its_possible_to_be_happy_again_in/kx4ylvr/) (in reply to ID 1bqotju):\nin my case, i am an american who lived in Hong Kong for 3 years, loved it, had to move back to the USA,and have spent the last 20 years thinking about hong kong every day.

I moved back to America 2x.  Being an expat is an experience that can't be undone.  For me, when I am in the US, I do miss Japan to some extent.  When I am in Japan, I think about being America to some extent.  Regardless of what the future holds, both countries will always be part of me.\n\nIt takes time, but I do think you can be happy.  For me, it was about committing to the decision, knowing it would take really a couple of years to reconnect and reacclimate, and enjoy what I have in the moment.  For me, that took 2 years the first time back and nearly 3 the second time.  I moved back to Japan eventually, but that was, in a good part, because I could see my wife would be happier in her country.  We also had job opportunities for both of us.\n\nI can see retirement.  It's like 7 years away.  I do worry about getting old in Japan.  My language skills are ok for many things, but when I needed surgery a couple of years ago, the bureacratic process of admission to the hospital pre-surgery (and during COVID) opened my eyes to how much I am unprepared.  And on the relationship side, I see my family and friends and their children in America - growns ups and near retirees - and I miss them and have missed much of their growth being so far away.\n\n## Comment ID kx53lu2 with +4 score by [(fd797, Reddit, 2024-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1bqotju/do_you_think_its_possible_to_be_happy_again_in/kx53lu2/) (in reply to ID 1bqotju):\nI moved away from my home country Canada (Quebec), to Germany and the U.S. and then had major reverse culture shock when I moved back.

Nu prea obisnuiesc sa comentez la postari de obicei. Sunt plecata de vreo 2 ani si ceva din Romania. M-am mutat in SUA dupa ce m-am casatorit. Initial imi era foarte dor de Romania, chiar incercam sa imi conving sotul sa ne mutam, imi era dor de tara, de familie fiind foarte apropiati. Prima data am venit in tara in februarie 2023 dupa ce am fost plecata cam un an. Cu tot dorul schimbarea a fost socanta, preturi mult mai mari, oameni needucati si nepoliticosi, efectiv haos. Crede-ma ca imi lipsise si aerul de aici si totusi nimic nu era cum lasasem eu si cum imi aminteam. Am stat in jur de o luna, pana la final ma adaptasem din nou si mi-a parut rau sa plec. A doua oara anul trecut in noiembrie, la fel groaznica intoarcerea dar sincer am fost bucuroasa sa plec. Iar acum ultima data si nu planuiesc sa ma întorc curand. Mi-am finalizat un implant dentar pe care sincer regret ca l-am facut aici. Parerea mea este sa vii in tara mai mult de 2 saptamani, stai in jur de o luna daca poti. Iti garantez ca iti trece tot dorul. Probabil te simti singur/a si izolat/a intr-o tara straina chestie pe care o inteleg si o simt si eu dar parerea mea e ca intoarcerea e o greseala. \nIn cei nici 3 ani de cand am plecat eu au intervenit schimbari majore: preturi f mari, chiar comparativ cu SUA, facturi mari, chirii mari, criminalitate crescuta, efectiv orice aici este un haos de nedescris. De la a obtine un act de care ai nevoie pana la condus in tara asta (no 1 la accidente rutiere btw). Din nou stai mai mult de o sapt sau 2 care este un fel de honeymoon period fiindca vii relaxat ca in vacanta. E greu sa te reintegrezi aici dupa ce ai trait intr-un sistem in care totul functioneaza. Evident toate tarile au defecte dar  e alegerea ta cu ce chestii poti trai. De cand am venit o sa iti redau doar cateva chestii care m-au innebunit: condusul aici e efectiv ca ruleta ruseasca, gunoi peste tot, rahati de caine peste tot, familia mea sta la bloc si am niste vecini draguti care adora manelele pana la 1 dimineata sau mai tarziu de cateva ori bune pe saptamana ( politia e o gluma am incercat), familia mea cu toate ca ii iubesc au senzatia ca am venit cu fite din strainatate lol, toata lumea are ceva de comentat despre felul cum arati etc, customer service nu exista etc. Daca tu crezi ca esti mai fericit aici cu toate astea succes.Iti recomand sa cauti mai degraba un partener de viata sau prieteni acolo. Familia poate veni in vizita. E alegerea ta dar schimbarea va fi majora si nu in bine.\n\n### Comment ID kx9bz1r with +3 score by [(by-the-willows, Reddit, 2024-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1bqotju/do_you_think_its_possible_to_be_happy_again_in/kx9bz1r/) (in reply to ID kx5ngx2):\nMulțumesc că ți-ai făcut timp totuși.

The people have changed, the relationships altered by time and distance and everyone having their own families now. The places I loved to go have new regulars and new vibes, or are gone entirely. Every house I remember from my life before has someone else living in it now. Mom isn't around to pick me up from the airport anymore and insist on way too many hugs because there's never enough time.

Currently considering Germany again with my partner for a couple of years.\n\nI don’t think I could live in Germany permanently but I like the thought of going back for a couple of years, have kids and once they are elementary age move to Japan again.\n\nWhy don’t you go to Romania for a bit and then depending on how you feel you can can always move to Germany again. \n\nI think not being at least a little “homesick” is impossible for most people (including myself) and no matter which country I’m in I always miss the other three. But after my second country abroad I realized it’s more of a mindset and nowadays I’m happy no matter where I live.

I have been living first in in Italy for around 15 years, then in the UK for roughly 5 years. I am dreaming of living in Romania. I am lucky enough to work from home, so it is not impossible. I am somewhat scared, but the feeling of coming home never fades away. The culture, the places, the smells (see the smell of an Eastern European corner shop ahaha), the churches and overall the vibe. I miss everything I am looking forward to come home this summer!!! Also underrated fact: it is weird when all the people around me speak Romanian because for all my life I associate that with my “family language”. Something that only an expat that grew abroad from a.very early age can understand. I am looking forward.I am thrilled!! And moving to Romania is definitely an option. Haide sa face tara noastra natala mantra de not. Sent foarte mandra ca sent Romanca si nu mi-as schimba cetetenia pantry nici una alta in lume!!",

The 2 musicals written by me and the young author Brianna Dociu will be released - \"Aripile Jos\" (Broken Wings) - a unique musical that sheds light on the problems of the educational system in Romania and how they can kill artists; \"Aici Incepe Viata\" (This Is Where Life Begins). I will release new music-videos and new songs from my next album entitled \"ECHILIBRU.\" (EQUILIBRIUM.) which brings Rockabilly music, Blues and of course Rock and Funk songs into the same universe.

I have been testing 1 page and used Grok, Chat GPT and Google Gemini and have received wildly different results (chat gpt mentions a child?!?). Original handwritten file is attached, and AI translations are below.\n\nCan someone please make a recommendation to which translation below is most accurate or provide some guidance on the best translation service for my needs? There are 44 pages total currently. Thank you.\n\n**Grok Translation:**\n\nHere is the English translation of the provided Romanian text:  \nPage 19, June 17, 1951  \nDear Uncle,  \nSince I am here, I want to write to you because I am in the position to do so, and I will continue to do so until I arrive there. I will introduce myself to you, although you know me, but not as well as when I will have arrived there. Here, I spend my days in the hotel room, reading Eminescu, which I know almost by heart. If I had new novels or at least a finance notebook or something to learn, I think I would be very happy. (I would whisper to you too).  \nHere, no one speaks Romanian, and although it's a splendid city, I am terribly bored. At the consulate, there's a very nice vice-consul who speaks Romanian; he sometimes comes to take us for a walk and introduced me to a very kind Romanian family where I had dinner yesterday. Today, I'm invited again (the lady is a great pianist), but I don't think I'll go because it's raining hard. It's a rain and a storm, dear uncle, like the one we got caught in at the movie \"Brave People,\" but the difference is colossal...  \nI am so alone here, like Robinson, with whom I often compare myself, except my island is an elegant but deserted hotel room. Let's read from Eminescu's poem \"Sleep\":  \n\"Why are you afraid? Aren't you with me?  \nLet the rain just beat against the windows  \nLet the sad wind sigh through the trees  \nBe calm, you're with me.\"  \nBut I'm not with anyone, dear uncle, and I'm so scared! There are whole nights when I can't sleep, and I count the days left until I leave here. (I leave on March 17) and then another 2-3 weeks until my new home. There, I believe I'll end all my troubles, especially loneliness.  \nYou know you are very busy with practice, but it's much better to be busy than to be alone, I tell you now from personal experience. Dear uncle, send many greetings to your colleagues and tell them I miss them all. Also, send compliments to Mrs. Mimi and Puiu (I haven't forgotten the hedgehogs / small socks / ping-pong balls), as well as to your mother. I kiss you a thousand times, dear sweet one, and wish you only well. I kiss you again,  \nBaby  \nP.S. Dear uncle, I send you this letter now from the ship \"Exeter\" where I've boarded because I didn't have time to send it from Istanbul. At the first opportunity, I'll write you another with the latest news. Today is March 20, 1951, with love, Baby.\n\n**Chat GPT Translation**\n\nDear Lely,\n\nThis might be the third time I’m writing to you, but I still don’t know if you’ll receive the letter. I will send it anyway.  \nPlease, I kindly ask you to reply to me at least once—it’s such an important question: How are you, and how is George?  \nI don’t know how to talk about anything else except my dear child. On Easter, he turned 6 years old. He’s grown, handsome, and is attending school. He would like to have some pictures of you; he’s very curious to see you. Thank you so much if you can send us some photos.  \nWe missed you on Easter. We had guests, and it was very nice, but I felt an emptiness in my heart.\n\nI think I will never get used to the idea that you are not with us. I miss those times, and even though the child is small, he feels your absence too. He talks about you often, and I tell him that you’re well and that you’ll write to us.\n\nAt home, things are going well. We’ve started putting aside some money for the future. Recently, we bought a small second-hand car, but it’s very useful for shopping and our daily errands. We hope that one day we’ll be able to visit our relatives more often.\n\nI’ve received news from Maria – they didn’t bring their child to visit this year either, but they sent me a long letter with many details about their life. It seems everything is going well, and their children are growing up quickly.\n\nPlease write to me as soon as you can. I think about you every day and pray that you’re doing well. In closing, I want to tell you that we love you and miss you very much.\n\nWith love,  \nMother\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yb1re3ejjnae1.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=29a1a61d06e379ccf13ed98afca5b03c2e0f970e\n\n\n\n## Comment ID m5330f8 with +3 score by [(exmachinaadastra, Reddit, 2025-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/romanian/comments/1hs5kjj/translation_assistance_ai_recommendations/m5330f8/) (in reply to ID 1hs5kjj):\nHey!

Don't think, my dear, that this is an introduction to a letter. I don't want to make excuses for not answering you, even though I received your letter 5 days ago, but every time I want to write to you, I cry. Even now, I see the fact that I left our beloved city and country as a mistake that I will never forgive myself for. You think I'm happy when I see myself so alone, as I couldn't imagine a man before. Indeed, as I wrote to you in my last letter, I had a pleasant trip full of wonderful views and adventures. Along with the countless days in which my eyes were delighted by the beauty of the Turkish mosques, the Acropolis with the wonderful Pantheon, the Bosphorus, Italy, the fairy-tale country, Marseille where I bought good perfumes, there followed countless nights of terror when I missed you and there were moments when I felt so hopeless that I don't think it would have taken me long to get used to the waves that hit so proudly at night. Of course, the fact that I spent almost whole nights on the side of the ship crying, the fact that even now my face is bruised by the winds and the rains that beat down on me almost every night, you see them as something romantic, but I wouldn't wish them on my worst enemy, even if it were my dearest (I'm sure you can't imagine this). because I would have been ( xxxxx I don't understand xxxxx)\n\nI thought (xxxx I don't understand xxxx)\n\nI arrived in new york during a rainy time and I didn't like it at all, those dark streets because of the huge (I don't understand) which even in summer are (I don't understand) like a tomb, arrived in cleveland another row of ...(I don't understand). the houses 98% made of wood and all almost the same even after 2 days I looked at the number to know where I live. still cleveland is a beautiful city and america is much beyond my imagination. the clean houses, each with a garden in front of the house the wide, bright streets, wonderful buildings, the people much kinder and civilized, these are the things I say now after I got used to it and even liked this kind of life a little.

      "# [Benjamin Turquin, CEO of BRD Asigurari de Viata: Romanians used to rely on “God help!” for protection, but this is progressively changing on 2024-05-10](https://www.romania-insider.com/interview-benjamin-turquin-brd-asigurari-romania-insirance-market)\n“The Romanian market has major potential for insurance in general and for life insurance in particular,” says Benjamin Turquin, CEO of BRD Asigurari de Viata and Country Manager for BRD Asigurari, the commercial brand of BRD Asigurari Generale and BRD Asigurari de Viata.\n\nWith 83% of the money going into non-life insurance and motor insurance standing for 62% of the total insurance premiums, the Romanian insurance market is significantly different compared with other European markets, where most insurance premiums come from life insurance. At the same time, the average life insurance premium per inhabitant is ten times lower than in Germany or France and two times lower than in the Czech Republic or Poland.\n\nHowever, these differences also mean that the Romanian market is full of promises and it will keep on growing in the future, believes Benjamin Turquin.\n\nOne reason for the underdevelopment of the Romanian life insurance market is the “short-term orientation”, but this is starting to change.\n\n“We care little about what will happen tomorrow and rely on “Doamne ajuta!” (e.n. - God help!) to protect us. <<Why should I pay today to protect from something that may not happen?>>. I see a major evolution in the awareness. People frequently wonder how they can protect their families and ensure their financial future. This is our role as an insurance company, to offer a variety of solutions fit for different needs,” explains Benjamin Turquin.\n\nRead more in the Q&A interview below:\n\nPlease tell us a bit about the BRD Group’s presence in the Romanian insurance market: what segments of the market are you active in and how has the business evolved in recent years?\n\nBenjamin Turquin: BRD Group’s presence in the Romanian insurance market started with life insurance in 2009 through the set-up of BRD Asigurari de Viata, the life and savings insurance company in Romania of Société Générale group, which is one of Europe's leading financial services groups. Active in the real economy for 160 years, with a strong position in Europe and strongly connected to the rest of the world, Société Générale has more than 126,000 employees in 65 countries, advising and serving 25 million individual, corporate and institutional clients worldwide every day.\n\nBRD Asigurari de Viata has grown and it is ranked as the fourth-biggest life insurer in the Romanian market, with almost 10% market share (data as of December 2023). We now cover both life and general insurance areas, with the launch in 2018 of BRD Asigurari Generale in Romania.\n\nStrong because of our 15 years of experience and our 170 committed employees, I still consider our company as a start up with a resilient activity. This enables us to address the ambitious development plan we have: strengthen our bancassurance model while opening our product range to new distribution channels (brokers, online, bancassurance).\n\nIndeed, BRD Asigurari offers an extended range of life and property & casualty insurance solutions for Romanian individuals and companies, mainly distributed through BRD - Groupe Société Générale network.\n\nBRD Asigurări de Viață steadily diversified its product range, from credit life insurance to life insurance with investment component solutions, such as our latest launched LongVITA INVEST. The non-life activity developed with BRD Asigurari Generale in the past years fully completes our offer during the key life moments of our clients.\n\nHow is the life insurance market in Romania compared with other countries in Europe? How do you expect it to evolve in the following years?\n\nBenjamin Turquin: The Romanian market has a major potential for insurance in general and for life insurance in particular. Non-life insurance in Romania represents 83% of the market, mainly driven by motor insurance, standing for 62% of the total insurance premiums. This is a major difference compared with other European markets, where most insurance premiums come from life insurance.\n\nEven though domestic economic growth strengthened the life insurance market, the average life insurance premium per inhabitant is still lagging behind. Indeed, it is ten times lower when compared with Germany or France and half compared with Czech Republic or Poland.\n\nSeveral factors led us here from my perspective.\n\nFirst is the Romanian history with insurance companies, which challenged the trust of clients in this sector. To fulfill our mission of protecting and assisting our clients, we focus on our role as a reliable and responsible insurer.\n\nThe second reason is cultural as Romania has a short-term orientation. We care little about what will happen tomorrow and rely on “Doamne ajuta!” (e.n. - God help!) to protect us. “Why should I pay today to protect from something that may not happen?”. I see a major evolution in the awareness. People frequently wonder how they can protect their families and ensure their financial future. This is our role as an insurance company, to offer a variety of solutions fit for different needs.\n\nThe Romanian high-risk adversity in investment is the third reason why life insurance has not reached its full potential yet. Romanian investors are largely directly investing in fixed-income bonds. The offer in terms of investment tools also remains limited. In BRD Asigurari de Viata, we propose a large range of funds, both Romanian and international, embedded with life insurance and offering as main benefits: no tax on the benefits, free choice of beneficiaries, protection of the initial invested amount in case of death.\n\nThe Romanian market is full of promises and it will keep on growing in the future.\n\nAre Romanians aware of the benefits of life insurance products? What types of insurance coverage are they most interested in this segment?\n\nBenjamin Turquin: The growing awareness among Romanians in financial planning and education is contributing to a greater interest in life insurance products and their benefits. BRD Asigurari de Viata is collaborating with actors in the banking & insurance industry to increase the level of financial knowledge.\n\nLife insurance products offer financial stability and protection to loved ones. These benefits are less tangible, so they can be harder to perceive compared with home or travel insurance coverage. Transparency to customers on the guarantees and clarity of terms and conditions are the keys to the further development of the life insurance market.\n\nFrom our experience and life product range, our individual clients are mostly interested in credit life insurance and life insurance with an investment component.\n\nThe life insurance attached to a credit, whether it be a mortgage, consumer loan, or credit card, is in line with the natural appetence of Romanian people for owning their home. It comes as a necessity for credit borrowers to protect their loved ones. The interest in this coverage is even clearer when sold online together with the loan. Thus, with BRD, each borrower can be properly protected, when contracting a loan.\n\nOur clients are also interested in the benefits of our life insurance products with an investment component, which, along with the many benefits listed above, offer portfolio diversification. Indeed, our clients have the possibility of investing in several funds at the national and international level while benefitting from exposure to the capital market. They can invest and be protected at the same time.\n\nWhen looking at our corporate clients, their main interest lies in our employee benefit offer through group health insurance and group term life insurance. This is for them both the occasion to increase employee retention and benefit from tax deductibility.\n\nIn my opinion, subscribing to a life insurance policy is an act of responsibility to protect the future of your dearest ones.\n\nWhich are the most popular life insurance products offered by BRD Asigurari de Viata and what are their benefits?\n\nBenjamin Turquin: The strength of the bancassurance model that is part of our DNA resides in our capacity to be present in every key life moment of our clients’ lives. From the acquisition of their first home to the birth of their children while planning for their life projects.\n\nFor this exact reason, our most popular products are life insurance products linked with credits. We confirmed the interest of clients for such coverages after launching our life insurance product linked with BRD online consumer loans.\n\nOur life insurance products with an investment component are also very popular as they answer the various needs of our clients. They offer similar advantages as the benefits are tax-free; the insured can choose the beneficiaries they see fit and benefit from the protection of the initial invested amount in case of death.\n\nEduplan, one of our life insurance with investment component products, is very popular as it offers the possibility of accumulating capital dedicated to the future of a child through regular payment. The product offers either a personal or automated investment strategy, depending on the needs of the client. BRD Asigurari de Viata covers, in case of death of the insured and until maturity of the contract, the regular payment for the construction of the capital dedicated to the kid’s future.\n\nInvest Benefit + and LongVITA INVEST are highly appreciated as portfolio diversification options. Indeed, in case of the death of the insured, BRD Asigurari de Viata covers the invested capital devaluation up to EUR 200,000.\n\nOur corporate clients come to us for their employee benefits packages, as we offer group life and health insurance meant for companies and small businesses. They provide financial protection in case of unforeseen events for employees. It is now a standard request from employers to ensure employees’ well-being and retention. It is part of the expected incentive packages, increasing employees’ satisfaction, engagement and loyalty.\n\nWhat do you think is needed to stimulate the development of the life insurance market in Romania?\n\nBenjamin Turquin: Stimulating the development of the life insurance market in Romania requires a combination of factors aimed at addressing various challenges and capitalizing on growth opportunities.\n\nThe first point is ensuring a long-term financial perspective for consumers. There are two main levels of action. Short and medium-term, it is about keeping a favorable fiscal environment for life insurance with an investment component in comparison with other investment solutions. This will encourage consumers to diversify their investment portfolio. Considering a long-term perspective, it is crucial to increase financial awareness. Educational campaigns and initiatives promote both financial planning and risk management, helping people make informed decisions about life insurance products.\n\nAnother important leverage for market growth is the accessibility of its products. The key lies in the simplification of processes for subscription, modification and claims both online and offline. As the interest in life insurance products rises, insurers will invest in digital solutions to meet clients’ expectations. This virtuous cycle will improve accessibility and customer engagement.\n\nHow would you describe the current situation in the general insurance market in Romania and how do you expect it to evolve in the following years?\n\nBenjamin Turquin: Due to the awareness regarding motor, home, and health insurance, the market is very price-sensitive and easily impacted by inflation and other market disturbances.\n\nThe general insurance market stabilized after the bankruptcies in the motor insurance segment. The regulatory framework enabled to minimize the impact on customers and led to a new order on the market.\n\nRegarding home insurance, the penetration rate increases slower than the real estate risk suggests, stagnating close to 20% for mandatory insurance. Awareness of risk is key for this type of insurance; indeed, after the important earthquakes that happened in the region in 2023, there was a sharp increase in PAD policies.\n\nStrong from the awareness clients have of motor and home insurance products, the general insurance sector in Romania is undergoing digital transformation. This will lead to a clear simplification of client experience. The emergence of insurtechs in Romania is likely to accelerate this already ongoing process and push insurers out of their comfort zone. This is very good news for clients, resulting in an enhanced customer experience.\n\nInsurers will have to embrace innovation and digital technologies and focus on customer-centric strategies to thrive in this evolving landscape.\n\nWhich are the most dynamic segments in the local general insurance market and what segments have been underperforming?\n\nBenjamin Turquin: The most dynamic segment in the local general insurance market is motor insurance, particularly mandatory third-party liability insurance (known as RCA). It represents more than half of the non-life insurance market.\n\nHome insurance has a significant potential. Indeed, even though PAD is compulsory, we face the situation in which only 1 in 5 Romanians have their home insured. It is a dynamic segment of the Romanian market, with an increased demand linked with increasing construction activity and property ownership. The volumes of this type of insurance have increased significantly by 22% in 2023 as compared to 2022. BRD Asigurari Generale is very active in the home insurance market, with an 85% increase in volume in 2023 as compared to 2022. Other segments are also highly developing, like travel insurance, for example. Overall, while certain segments within the Romanian general insurance market are experiencing growth and dynamism, others may require strategic initiatives to stimulate demand and improve market penetration. BRD Asigurari Generale always carefully assesses market dynamics, customer preferences, and competitive pressures to capitalize on growth opportunities and come up with products that serve the customers’ needs.\n\nWhat is BRD Insurance’s approach to the general insurance market? How are you looking to consolidate your position?\n\nBenjamin Turquin: Our strategy revolves around capturing the strength of the bancassurance model while creating new insurance products and expanding into new distribution channels. While we recognize the significant potential for growth, achieving this requires also substantial investments.\n\nOur focus was on products embedded with banking products. We have developed travel and means of payment insurance linked with daily banking products to offer benefits to BRD clients.\n\nAlong the way, we have added our home insurance linked with BRD mortgage loans to offer comprehensive protection to BRD clients for their homes and families.\n\nStrong from our expertise, we have launched a home insurance product available for any BRD client, whether owning or renting and we are looking to develop further in this direction.\n\nWe are targeting to develop new products offering more insurance coverages and to diversify our distribution channels (brokers and online bancassurance).\n\nHow important are innovation and digitization in the insurance sector? Can you give us examples of new products you have launched in recent years to address new consumer needs?\n\nBenjamin Turquin: Innovation and digitalization have become fundamental drivers of transformation in the insurance sector, enabling insurers to adapt to evolving customer expectations, market dynamics, and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe aim is to address customers’ needs for simplified and accessible products and information. It is now a must-have to be present online with our offers. This is why we created with BRD an online flow offering both consumer loans and the attached credit life insurance in a smooth process.\n\nWhen in the agency, we are unrolling e-signature processes so that BRD clients can have access to their documents at any given time.\n\nInnovation also comes from product types and solutions offered to clients. We are proud of our latest launched product, LongVITA INVEST, life insurance with an investment component. It is the first life insurance product in Romania that offers the possibility to invest in structured funds, giving access to the performance of capital markets while benefitting from capital and yield guaranteed at maturity. For example, LongVITA INVEST, is offering capital protection at maturity of the structured fund invested in.\n\nWe strive to use digitization to offer information and accessibility to our products for our clients, where they need to, when contacting our distributors or online.\n\nWhat do you think differentiates BRD Asigurari Generale and BRD Asigurari de Viata from other companies in the local insurance market?\n\nBenjamin Turquin: What sets us apart from other insurance companies on the market is our robust bancassurance model with BRD - Groupe Société Générale, together with the strong synergies created as part of a powerful and trustful French group.\n\nOur team of committed employees strives to deliver our clients transparent information together with reliable and reactive solutions regarding our products and customer support.\n\nWe offer insurance solutions with clear benefits and information to our clients to accompany them in their key life moments. From protecting the home and credit of our clients’ to proposing solutions to plan for their kids’ future and innovative life insurance with investment components.\n\nOur clients have simplified access to our customer support through one email and phone number. Our internal CRM enables us to identify quickly the clients and offer them the needed answers in due time.\n\nWe carefully monitor Key Performance Indicators, such as claims answers timeline to optimize the journey of our clients and their beneficiaries.\n\nHow is sustainability integrated into BRD Asigurari de Viata activity?\n\nBenjamin Turquin: In BRD Asigurari de Viata, we consider companies have an important role to play in sustainability.\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) covers 3 main categories: environmental, social, and economic, and we have translated them into finding ways to be a responsible investor, insurer, and employer.\n\nAs a Responsible Investor, we are working closely with group Société Générale to support concrete and public commitments for sustainable finance. We thrive at making sustainability an important driver in our asset management strategy; indeed, the CSR dimension is systematically taken into account in our offer.\n\nAs a Responsible Insurer, our life insurance with investment components offers the possibility to invest in funds promoting social & environmental responsibility. We also work to ensure a transparent and customer-centric approach and provide clarity on fees charged and amounts covered by our guarantees to make the insurance world simpler and easier to understand.\n\nConcrete and individual actions are taken on a daily basis. For example, in our offices, single-use plastic cups have been replaced by mugs and glasses, and our employees participate in selective recycling. From a governance perspective, we are limiting promotional materials and promoting products from EU countries without plastic, collaborating with suppliers aligned with our CSR ambition (on purchasing).\n\nAs a Responsible Employer, we promote the quality of life at work, diversity, inclusion, skills development, and conduct business responsibly.\n\nTraining and awareness-raising activities are delivered throughout the year – our employees have been trained on climate changes, and we are just beginning our journey with the deployment of the 2-tons workshop to spot and promote individual actions to complete ours.\n\nTo conclude, group Société Générale ambition and our goal, as part of the group, is building together with our clients, a better and sustainable future through responsible and innovative financial solutions.\n\n---\n\nBenjamin Turquin has been the Country Manager of Société Générale Assurances in Romania since June 2022.

Given the importance of the processing of personal data for the work of law enforcement in general, and for the support provided by Europol in particular, this Regulation should include enhanced safeguards, democratic oversight and accountability mechanisms, to ensure that the activities and tasks of Europol are carried out in full compliance with fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter, in particular the rights to equality before the law, to non-discrimination, and to an effective remedy before the competent national court against any of the measures taken pursuant to this Regulation.

In particular, providers of online content services should ensure that any processing of personal data under this Regulation is necessary, reasonable and proportionate in order to achieve the relevant purpose. Where authentication of a subscriber is sufficient in order to provide the service, identification of the subscriber should not be required. Data collected pursuant to this Regulation for the purposes of verification of the Member State of residence should not be stored by the provider longer than necessary to complete such verification.

There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\n\nArticle 16\n\n1. States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in all matters relating to marriage and family relations and in particular shall ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women:\n\n(a) The same right to enter into marriage;\n\n(b) The same right freely to choose a spouse and to enter into marriage only with their free and full consent;\n\n(c) The same rights and responsibilities during marriage and at its dissolution;\n\n(d) The same rights and responsibilities as parents, irrespective of their marital status, in matters relating to their children; in all cases the interests of the children shall be paramount;\n\n(e) The same rights to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and to have access to the information, education and means to enable them to exercise these rights;\n\n(f) The same rights and responsibilities with regard to guardianship, wardship, trusteeship and adoption of children, or similar institutions where these concepts exist in national legislation; in all cases the interests of the children shall be paramount;\n\n(g) The same personal rights as husband and wife, including the right to choose a family name, a profession and an occupation;\n\n(h) The same rights for both spouses in respect of the ownership, acquisition, management, administration, enjoyment and disposition of property, whether free of charge or for a valuable consideration.\n\n2. The betrothal and the marriage of a child shall have no legal effect, and all necessary action, including legislation, shall be taken to specify a minimum age for marriage and to make the registration of marriages in an official registry compulsory.\n\nArticle 22 – Respect for privacy\n\n1. No person with disabilities, regardless of place of residence or living arrangements, shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence or other types of communication or to unlawful attacks on his or her honour and reputation. Persons with disabilities have the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.\n\n2. States Parties shall protect the privacy of personal, health and rehabilitation information of persons with disabilities on an equal basis with others.\n\nC. Right to privacy and family life\n\n‘34. Article 12 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights provides that “[n]o one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence.” A similar provision is found in Article 17(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and in other United Nations instruments. This right has been interpreted broadly, encompassing inter alia the protection against forced evictions, the demolition of homes or property, the destruction of traditional burial grounds, and the expulsion of foreigners. The right to family life also applies in relation to persons deprived of liberty, who should be allowed to communicate with their families, subject only to reasonable restrictions established by law.\n\n35. The right to family life is reflected in the general preference for preserving the family unit and non-separation of its members, particularly dependent members. The Convention on the Rights of the Child affirms the right of children not to be separated from their parents against their will, except where “necessary for the best interest of the child,” such as in cases of abuse or neglect (art. 9.1), following a judicial determination to this effect. Children deprived of their family environment should be provided alternative care (art. 20), and, whenever possible, to have contact with their parents (art. 9(3)). According to article 23(4) of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in no case shall a child be separated from parents on the basis of a disability of either the child or one or both of the parents.\n\n36. The Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers and their Families requires States to ensure “the protection of the unity of the families,” including by facilitating the reunification of documented migrants with their spouses and dependent children (art. 44). The Convention on the Rights of the Child urges State Parties to deal with such requests in a “positive, humane and expeditious manner” (art. 10).‘",

Introducerea ETA este in concordanta cu abordarea adoptata de multe alte tari in ceea ce priveste securitatea frontierelor, inclusiv SUA si Australia, si ajuta la prevenirea sosirii celor care prezinta o amenintare pentru UK.\n\nEuropenii eligibili pot aplica pentru ETA și pot călători cu ETA începand cu 2 aprilie 2025.\n\nNon-europenii eligibili au deja nevoie de ETA pentru a calatori in Marea Britanie.\n\nETA este o permisiune digitală de călătorie – nu este o viză și nu permite intrarea în Marea Britanie – doar autorizează o persoană să călătorească spre Marea Britanie.\n\nAplicarea pentru ETA este ușoară și simplă. Majoritatea solicitantilor primesc o decizie automata în cateva minute atunci când aplică prin aplicația UK ETA, ceea ce înseamnă că în continuare se poate călători spontan în UK.\n\nVizitatorii trebuie sa aplice în avans și li se recomandă să aloce trei zile lucratoare pentru a primi decizia la cererea lor, în caz că situația lor ar necesita o analiză suplimentară.\n\nPentru a aplica pentru ETA trebuie să:\n\nPlătiți o taxă – costa £10 și din 9 aprilie 2025 va costa £16.\n\nFurnizați date de contact și detalii despre pasaport\n\nFurnizați o fotografie valabila, conform regulilor HO pentru fotografii digitale\n\nRaspundeți la un set de întrebări.\n\nTrebuie să călătoriți cu pașaportul pe care l-ați folosit atunci când ați aplicat pentru ETA.\n\nETA permite călătorii multiple în Marea Britanie pentru sederi de pana la sase luni pe parcursul a doi ani sau pana la expirarea pasaportului titularului – oricare dintre acestea se întâmplă mai devreme.\n\nCea mai usoara modalitate de a aplica pentru un ETA este prin aplicatia „UK ETA app”, care poate fi descarcata din Google Play sau Apple App Store. Oamenii pot aplica pe GOV.UK dacă nu au acces la un smartphone.\n\nReamintim cine nu are nevoie de ETA :\n\n-dacă sunteți scutit de controlul imigrației (exempt from immigration control), dacă aveți o viză, dacă aveți statut de settled sau pre-settled sau right of abode, dacă sunteți în tranzit printr-un aeroport din UK și nu veți trece prin controlul de frontieră, dacă sunteți cetățean britanic sau irlandez, dacă călătoriți cu un pașaport de cetățean al teritoriilor britanice de peste mări (British overseas territories citizen), dacă călătoriți cu un pașaport de British National (Overseas), dacă locuiți în Irlanda și călătoriți din Irlanda, Guernsey, Jersey sau Insula Man, dacă sunteți un copil care călătorește folosind formularul de informații de călătorie pentru excursiile școlare Franța-UK (France-UK school trip travel information form).\n\nCum ajută ETA la securitatea frontierei Marii Britanii?\n\nCei care aplică pentru ETA dau detalii biografice, biometrice si de contact si raspund la un set scurt de intrebari despre eligibilitate si cazier. Pentru Home Office asta înseamnă ca se va mări cantitatea de informații despre cei care doresc sa vina in Marea Britanie și va preveni sosirea celor care prezinta o amenintare.\n\nCe se intamplă daca cineva nu poate obține ETA?\n\nDaca cererea de ETA a unei persoane este respinsa, i se va comunica motivul si poate aplica din nou.\n\nDaca cererea de ETA a unei persoane este refuzată, aceasta nu poate face apel si trebuie sa aplice pentru o viză dacă dorește în continuare permisiunea de a veni în UK.\n\nCum functioneaza ETA in Irlanda de Nord?\n\nMarea Britanie nu opereaza controale de imigratie de rutina pentru calatoriile din cadrul Common Travel Area, fara control de imigratie la granita terestra Irlanda-Irlanda de Nord.\n\nCu toate acestea, toti cei care sosesc in Marea Britanie, inclusiv cei care intra in Irlanda de Nord, trebuie sa respecte Regulile de Imigratie ale Marii Britanii, inclusiv obtinerea ETA daca sunt eligibili.\n\nCetatenii britanici si irlandezi nu au nevoie de un ETA.\n\nRezidentii non-irlandezi ai Irlandei, din nationalitati care nu au nevoie de viza pentru a vizita Marea Britanie (de exemplu, cetatenii europeni si americani), nu au nevoie de ETA atunci cand calatoresc in Marea Britanie – inclusiv in Irlanda de Nord – din cadrul Common Travel Area, care include Irlanda, cu conditia sa detina dovezi acceptabile ale statutului lor de rezidenta. Ghidul complet poate fi gasit aici. Daca acestia calatoresc in UK din afara Common Travel Area, vor avea nevoie de ETA inainte de a calatori.\n\nVa crește taxa pentru ETA in viitor?\n\nCa si in cazul tuturor taxelor Home Office, costul ETA este revizuit periodic. Creșterile de preț vor reduce dependența de finanțarea pentru sistemul de migrație și frontiere din partea contribuabililor.\n\nEste nevoie de ETA pentru cei care tranziteaza prin Marea Britanie? Daca da, de ce?\n\nIn urma feedback-ului din partea industriei aviației, guvernul a agreat o excepție temporară pentru pasagerii care tranzitează aerian (airside), si prin urmare, nu trec prin controlul de frontieră al Marii Britanii, de a avea nevoie de ETA. Excepția va fi revizuita periodic.\n\nPasagerii care tranziteaza prin Marea Britanie trecând prin controlul de frontieră al Marii Britanii vor avea in continuare nevoie de ETA.\n\nCâți oameni au aplicat pentru ETA? Home Office va publica pe GOV.UK statistici despre numărul de cereri de ETA aprobate și respinse.\n\nSursa: Home Office – Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) Factsheet – 19 martie 2025\n\nGhiduri suplimentare despre ETA sunt disponibile pe GOV.UK și în limba română -> aici.\n\nMaterial de V.Dobrescu&A.Drogoreanu\n\nLista HMRC cu cei care fraudează taxele intenționat\n\nHMRC a publicat ieri, 18 Martie lista contribuabililor care au evitat în mod deliberat plata taxelor, actualizată la zi, listă pe care figurează și români cu firme sau self-employed, care au fraudat taxe.\n\nSumele incluse în listă se referă la taxele sau impozitele pe baza cărora au fost aplicate penalități, precum și la penalitățile impuse, în cazul în care acestea îndeplinesc criteriile de publicare conform legislației privind publicarea detaliilor contribuabililor care evită intenționat plata taxelor. Lista nu reflectă neapărat întreaga datorie fiscală a contribuabilului.\n\nDetails first published 18 March 2025\n\nDetails first published 28 November 2024\n\nDetails first published 25 September 2024\n\nDetails first published 9 July 2024\n\nBack to top\n\nSursa: HM Revenue\n\n& Customs – Details of deliberate tax defaulters\n\nHelp to Save\n\nSchema guvernamentală Help to Save – este un tip de cont de economii special conceput pentru persoanele cu venituri mici. Poți economisi între £1 și £50 pe lună, dar nu ești obligat să economisești în fiecare lună. La sfârșitul a doi și patru ani, primești un bonus de 50%, până la un maxim de £1.200. Poți face retrageri dacă ai nevoie.\n\nCum funcționează Help to Save?\n\nEconomisește până la £50/lună. Este un cont cu acces facil, deci poți retrage bani dacă ai nevoie.\n\nPrimul bonus de 50% este plătit după doi ani. Acesta este calculat pe baza celui mai mare sold din primii doi ani (maxim £600 bonus).\n\nAl doilea bonus de 50% este plătit după patru ani. Acesta este calculat pe diferența dintre cel mai mare sold din anii trei și patru și cel mai mare sold din primii doi ani (maxim £600 bonus).\n\nCum mă calific pentru Help to Save?\n\nTrebuie să fii rezident în UK și să îndeplinești una dintre următoarele condiții:\n\nSă primești Universal Credit și să ai venituri din muncă de cel puțin £793,17 în ultima perioadă de evaluare lunară.\n\nSă fii eligibil pentru Working Tax Credit și să primești Working sau Child Tax Credit.\n\nDacă nu mai ești eligibil pentru Universal Credit sau Working Tax Credit după ce ai deschis contul, poți continua să economisești. Trebuie să fii eligibil doar la momentul deschiderii contului.\n\nÎncepând cu aprilie 2025, orice persoană care lucrează și primește Universal Credit și care câștigă cel puțin £1 va fi eligibilă.\n\nPoți deschide un cont până în aprilie 2027. Odată deschis, îl poți păstra timp de patru ani.\n\nCum aplic?\n\nOnline, la Help to Save pe Gov.uk. Trebuie să te autentifici în contul tău Government Gateway (aceleași detalii pe care le folosești pentru Universal Credit sau Tax Credits). Dacă nu ai un ID pentru Government Gateway, sună la Help to Save support line la 0300 322 7093. HMRC îți poate deschide un cont prin întrebări de securitate, fără să fie nevoie de un ID. Vei avea nevoie de nino – numărul tău de asigurare națională (National Insurance Number).\n\nTelefonic, sunând la HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) la 0300 322 7093.\n\nPrin aplicația HMRC\n\nCare e treaba cu bonusul de 50% ?\n\nBonusul pentru primii doi ani este calculat pe baza celui mai mare sold atins, nu a sumei rămase în cont.\n\nDe exemplu, dacă ai economisit £1.000 dar ai retras £200 înainte de finalul celor doi ani, rămânând cu un sold de £800, vei primi tot un bonus de £500, deoarece acesta se bazează pe cel mai mare sold atins (£1.000).\n\nBonusul pentru anii trei și patru este calculat pe diferența dintre cel mai mare sold din primii doi ani și cel mai mare sold din ultimii doi ani.\n\nExemplu:\n\nÎn primii doi ani ai economisit £500 și ai primit un bonus de £250.\n\nAi retras cei 500 pentru că ai avut nevoie de ei.\n\nÎn anii trei și patru ai economisit £750.\n\nBonusul tău va fi de £125 (£750 – £500 = £250, bonusul fiind 50% din diferența dintre cele două, adică din £250 ).\n\nNu ești sigur că te califici?\n\nNu-ți face griji – eligibilitatea este verificată automat în timpul procesului de aplicare. Dacă nu ești eligibil, nu vei putea aplica.\n\nCum poți depune bani în cont?\n\nPoți efectua plăți prin:\n\nCard de debit\n\nOrdin de plată permanent (standing order)\n\nTransfer bancar\n\nPoți face oricâte depozite în fiecare lună, atâta timp cât nu depășești £50/lună.\n\nHelp to Save îmi afectează beneficiile?\n\nPe cont propriu, nu – dacă acestea sunt singurele economii pe care le ai.\n\nDacă ai și alte economii, atunci banii economisiți aici pot afecta beneficiile, dacă depășesc pragul de economii de £6.000 pentru Universal Credit sau reducerea taxei de consiliu (Council Tax Reduction).\n\nPentru economii peste £6.000, pierzi £4,35/lună din Universal Credit sau £1/lună din reducerea la Council tax, pentru fiecare £250 economisiți peste acest prag.\n\nEconomii peste £16.000 te descalifică de la Universal Credit și reducerea la Council tax.\n\nDacă locuiești cu un partener, economiile acestuia sunt luate în considerare împreună cu ale tale. Așadar, dacă ambii economisiți suma maximă timp de patru ani, economiile voastre combinate pot depăși pragul de £6.000 și vă pot afecta beneficiile.\n\nDacă primești Working Tax Credit sau Child Tax Credit, bonusul Help to Save nu este impozabil și nu este considerat venit suplimentar, deci nu îți va afecta beneficiile în anul în care este plătit.\n\nMerită să economisesc în anii trei și patru?\n\nÎn general, da. Chiar dacă randamentul nu este la fel de mare – practic primești un bonus maxim de 25% în anii trei și patru – este totuși o opțiune mai bună decât orice altă formă de economisire.\n\nExemplu:\n\nEconomisești £50/lună timp de doi ani → Ai £1.200 → Primești £600 bonus (50%).\n\nContinui să economisești £50/lună timp de alți doi ani → Ajungi la £2.400 → Primești £600 bonus (50% din sumele adăugate în ultimii doi ani).\n\nTotal economii: £3.000, cu un bonus total de £1.200.\n\nContul Help to Save este administrat pe platforma National Savings & Investments (NS&I), ceea ce înseamnă că economiile tale sunt 100% sigure.\n\nSursa: Get help with savings if you’re on a low income (Help to Save)\n\nMaterial de V.Dobrescu&A.Drogoreanu\n\nCe trebuie să faci când îți iei un immigration adviser\n\nE plin pe social media și în special pe grupurile de facebook, de persoane/conturi care se pretind immigration adviseri sau avocați, și-ți suflă în ceafă vânând orice postare unde cineva cere ajutor specializat, furând identități, date personale și înșelând oamenii. Unii mai țepari, doar să le ia banii la disperați, alții mai cu ștaif, cu carte de vizită că lucrează la Home Office, că sunt contabili autorizați(lol) sau că sunt specialiști în imigrație. Oricine poate să își facă un cont și să pretindă orice.\n\n1) Ce trebuie să faceți dacă aveți nevoie de ajutorul unei persoane calificate pe imigrație? În primul rând, înainte de orice discuție, să verificați orice nume vi se propune, orice nume din anunț, din reclamă, pagina de Fb sau recomandare și nu mai trimiteți bani oricui pretinde ca e avocat/specialist.\n\nDacă aveți nevoie de immigration adviser, folosiți Immigration Advice Authority (IAA) Adviser Finder pentru a găsi un specialist în imigrație acreditat, în zona în care locuiți. Sau pentru a verifica dacă e acreditat. Toți consilierii în domeniul imigrației trebuie să fie înregistrați la IAA sau să fie membri ai unui organism profesional aprobat.\n\nDacă aveți nevoie de avocați care oferă consultanță în materie de imigrație, puteți găsi solicitors aici :\n\nThe Law Society, dacă locuiți în Anglia sau Țara Galilor\n\nThe Law Society of Scotland\n\nThe Law Society of Northern Ireland\n\nUn avocat vă poate ajuta să gestionați cazul și să găsiți un barrister.\n\nCe pot face immigration adviserii: au voie să vă ofere sfaturi doar în aspectele pe nivelul la care sunt calificați. Puteți vedea ce tip de consultanță pot oferi în funcție de nivelul lor. Există 3 niveluri.\n\n-cei de nivelul 1 – pot oferi doar consultanță și asistență pentru cazuri simple, fără probleme și unde aveți toate documentele necesare pentru : entry clearance, leave to enter, leave to remain, nationality and citizenship, EU și EEA law\n\n-cei de nivelul 2 – pot face tot ceea ce pot face consilierii de nivel 1, dar pot accepta și cazuri mai complicate, de ex. dacă ați avut probleme anterioare cu imigrarea și doriți permisiunea de a rămâne în UK. Ei pot ajuta și cu: cereri de azil și aplicații pentru drepturile omului(human rights applications), situațiile în care ați intrat ilegal în UK sau ați rămas după expirarea vizei, administrative review, dacă sunteți supus deportării sau expulzării.\n\n-cei de nivel 3 pot face tot ceea ce pot face consilierii de nivel 1 și 2 și doar ei vă pot reprezenta la un tribunal de imigrare.\n\nVerificați dacă un consilier în imigrație este autorizat să vă ofere consultanța de care aveți nevoie înainte de a apela la el.\n\n2)Când vă luați un consilier în imigrație:\n\naflați cât percepe pentru servicii și dacă va trebui să îl plătiți\n\nsolicitați o chitanță semnată și datată dacă îi plătiți orice sumă de bani\n\nîntrebați cât veți avea de plătit dacă decideți să nu mai folosiți serviciile lui\n\nconveniți asupra unei taxe înainte ca acesta să facă orice muncă suplimentară pentru voi.\n\nUnii consilieri nu percep taxe pentru serviciile lor. Totuși, chiar dacă nu vă taxează, va trebui să plătiți pentru orice cheltuieli suplimentare, cum ar fi costurile pentru traduceri și taxele de aplicare.\n\nImediat după ce îl angajați, immigration adviserul trebuie să vă dea o scrisoare(client care letter) care precizează:\n\nce anume tip de muncă vor face pentru voi\n\ncât veți fi taxat\n\ncum veți efectua plata .

Veți putea face acest lucru direct prin Companies House, folosind GOV.UK One Login , sau printr-un Furnizor de Servicii Corporative Autorizat (Authorised Corporate Service Provider – ACSP).\n\nUlterior, verificarea identității va deveni obligatorie pentru:\n\nnoii directori și persoanele cu control semnificativ (PSCs)\n\ndirectorii și PSC-urile existente\n\noricine acționează în numele unei companii\n\nVerificarea identității se va aplica și altor tipuri de înregistrare.

Păi aici:\n\nDacă aștepți decizia la aplicația ta pentru settled sau pre-settled status și ai primit certificatul de aplicare CoA ( adică confirmarea că cererea ta este validă) și nu ai aplicat ca membru de familie care se alătură (joining family member), nu vei avea nevoie de ETA.\n\nFace sens, pentru că cei care aplica la rezidență ca membri de familie, nu au voie să călătorească în UK până nu primesc decizia de acordare a statusului, decât dacă au și Family Permit (care le acordă entry clearance).\n\nMembrii de familie non-europeni ai unui cetățean european cu rezidență în UK, nu au nevoie de ETA ca să călătorească spre UK dacă au family permit, status de rezidență sau viză.\n\n– cu alte cuvinte, dacă ai CoA pentru că ai aplicat în baza propriei prezențe în UK, în perioada eligibilă -nu ai nevoie de ETA, si daca ai aplicat ca membru de familie, iara nu ai nevoie de ETA pentru ca ori nu ai voie sa intri in UK fara family permit- si atunci nu-ti trebe ETA, ori ai family permit si n-ai nevoie de ETA.

Aceste verificări sunt aceleași ca cele efectuate atunci când persoana a aplicat inițial la rezidență și vor asigura eligibilitatea pentru settled status înainte de a fi acordat.\n\nSe estimează că primele acordări de settled status automat vor începe la sfârșitul lunii ianuarie 2025.\n\nPe parcursul anului 2025, Home Office intenționează să extindă acest proces automatizat pentru a permite mai multor deținători eligibili de pre-settled status să beneficieze de el. De asemenea, se analizează pașii adecvați pentru cazurile în care un deținător de pre-settled status nu mai îndeplinește condițiile, pentru nu a rămas rezident continuu în UK. Informații suplimentare vor fi furnizate în timp util.\n\nHome Office extinde deja pre-settled status cu 5 ani pentru persoanele care se apropie de expirarea acestuia, pentru a se asigura că nimeni nu își pierde drepturile din cauza neefectuării unei noi aplicații în cadrul EUSS.\n\nCei care au pre-settled status nu trebuie să aștepte să fie convertiți la settled status. Aceștia pot aplica pentru settled imediat ce sunt eligibili la: www.gov.uk/eusettlementscheme.

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on Viata\n\n## Company Overview\n\nViata is a life insurance company operating in Romania, under the umbrella of BRD Asigurari de Viata, which is part of the Société Générale group. Established in 2009, the company has grown to become the fourth-largest life insurer in Romania, holding nearly 10% of the market share as of December 2023. The company employs approximately 170 people and has a strong focus on bancassurance, leveraging its connection with BRD - Groupe Société Générale to distribute its products effectively [(Turquin, Romania Insider, 2024-05-10)](https://www.romania-insider.com/interview-benjamin-turquin-brd-asigurari-romania-insirance-market).\n\n## Market Position and Growth Potential\n\nThe Romanian insurance market presents significant growth potential, particularly in the life insurance sector, which has historically been underdeveloped. Currently, 83% of the market consists of non-life insurance, with motor insurance accounting for 62% of total premiums. In contrast, the average life insurance premium per inhabitant in Romania is substantially lower than in Western European countries, being ten times lower than in Germany or France [(Turquin, Romania Insider, 2024-05-10)](https://www.romania-insider.com/interview-benjamin-turquin-brd-asigurari-romania-insirance-market). This disparity indicates a promising opportunity for Viata to expand its offerings and increase market penetration as consumer awareness and demand for life insurance products grow.\n\n## Product Offerings\n\nViata has diversified its product range to include various life insurance solutions, such as:\n\n- **Credit Life Insurance**: This product is particularly popular among Romanian consumers, as it provides coverage linked to mortgages and loans, ensuring financial protection for families in case of unforeseen events.\n  \n- **Life Insurance with Investment Components**: Products like Eduplan and LongVITA INVEST allow clients to invest in structured funds while benefiting from life insurance coverage. These products are designed to appeal to clients looking for both protection and investment opportunities [(Turquin, Romania Insider, 2024-05-10)](https://www.romania-insider.com/interview-benjamin-turquin-brd-asigurari-romania-insirance-market).\n\nThe company has also introduced innovative products like LongVITA INVEST, which is the first life insurance product in Romania that offers the possibility to invest in structured funds, providing capital protection at maturity [(Turquin, Romania Insider, 2024-05-10)](https://www.romania-insider.com/interview-benjamin-turquin-brd-asigurari-romania-insirance-market).\n\n## Strategic Initiatives and Partnerships\n\nViata's strategy focuses on enhancing its bancassurance model and expanding its distribution channels. The company aims to strengthen its online presence and improve customer engagement through digital solutions. This includes the development of online platforms for purchasing insurance products and the implementation of e-signature processes to streamline customer interactions [(Turquin, Romania Insider, 2024-05-10)](https://www.romania-insider.com/interview-benjamin-turquin-brd-asigurari-romania-insirance-market).\n\n## Executive Leadership\n\nBenjamin Turquin serves as the Country Manager of Société Générale Assurances in Romania and CEO of BRD Asigurari de Viata. With over two decades of experience in various roles within the Société Générale group, Turquin emphasizes the importance of building trust with clients and enhancing financial literacy among the Romanian population. He believes that increasing awareness of life insurance benefits is crucial for market growth [(Turquin, Romania Insider, 2024-05-10)](https://www.romania-insider.com/interview-benjamin-turquin-brd-asigurari-romania-insirance-market).\n\n## Challenges and Opportunities\n\nDespite the promising outlook, the Romanian life insurance market faces challenges, including a historical lack of trust in insurance companies and a cultural tendency towards short-term financial thinking. However, Turquin notes a shift in consumer attitudes, with more individuals seeking ways to protect their families and secure their financial futures [(Turquin, Romania Insider, 2024-05-10)](https://www.romania-insider.com/interview-benjamin-turquin-brd-asigurari-romania-insirance-market).\n\nTo stimulate market growth, Viata is focusing on educational campaigns to enhance financial literacy and simplify the subscription process for insurance products. This approach aims to make life insurance more accessible and appealing to a broader audience [(Turquin, Romania Insider, 2024-05-10)](https://www.romania-insider.com/interview-benjamin-turquin-brd-asigurari-romania-insirance-market).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nViata is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth potential of the Romanian life insurance market. With a diverse product range, strategic partnerships, and a commitment to enhancing customer engagement through digital solutions, the company is poised for continued success. Prospective candidates and investors should consider the company's innovative approach and the evolving market landscape as key factors in their decision-making process."
