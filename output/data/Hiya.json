      "# [Imposter Apps and How to Spot Them: Chronicles of App Store Imitators by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/imposter-apps/)\nImitation is the highest form of flattery. If that’s true, we at Hiya should be thrilled to see so many apps in the App Store claiming to be Hiya. Somehow it doesn’t quite ring true though.\n\nImposter apps are looking for one thing: money. As such, they “build” fake apps, load them onto the App Store, charge money for them and then sit back and reap the financial benefits until Apple shuts them down. Then, they rinse and repeat with another app.\n\nIn Hiya’s case, we now have scammers scamming an anti-scam company. Consider the gauntlet thrown.\n\nHow can you tell if an app in the app store is an imposter?\n\nDeveloper name: Hiya’s developer name is Hiya. Simple! It should be recognizable or a name that you can easily look up and verify. Note: the developer name will not always match the app name (for example, Hiya also owns the Mr. Number app), but, with a little research, you should be able to confirm if the developer is indeed legitimate.\n\nWebsite: In the app store, we link toHiya’s Web Site and ourHiya Caller ID and Block Support page. Imposter apps will have links as well, however, they don’t function or will lead to a page that has nothing to do with the app.\n\nCost: Did you hear from a friend that Hiya is free? They were right! If you go into the App store and all of a sudden, you have to pay for a “free” app, you’re looking at an imposter.\n\nReviews: One of the most important tools at our fingertips. As fake apps are just that – fake, they will not function as they are supposed to. After paying $1.99 for an app and it doesn’t work, you can bet reviews will come in and they will not be pleasant. Take a look at the reviews. Sure, Hiya doesn’t get 5 star reviews all the time (nobody’s perfect…not yet, at least), but, we have a wide range of positive reviews from many users. Imposters will have only a few reviews and they will not be positive.\n\nImposters will receive a few, very bad reviews",
      "# [Amazon Scam Calls to Watch For | Hiya by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/amazon-scam)\nAmazon is in an enviable position of being a top retailer and having global brand recognition. The flip side of that, however, is that its notoriety makes it a prime target for scammers. Fraudsters making random robocalls have a good chance of reaching someone who has an Amazon account.\n\nAmazon has operations on five continents and has dedicated websites in 13 countries. It’s no wonder that Amazon phone scams are common in many countries, including\n\n#1 phone scam in Canada\n\n#1 phone scam in the UK\n\n#2 phone scam in the US\n\nHow do Amazon scam calls work?\n\nNo matter how hard you try to keep your phone number private, scammers have several tactics to obtain contact information. There are data brokers that find personal information online and sell it to third parties. Scammers can purchase this information and then contact you about your Amazon account. Scammers can also obtain any personal information that was leaked during a data breach.\n\nOnce they have your phone number, scammers make a call from an unknown number or one that was spoofed to appear as if it were coming from Amazon. The scammer then claims to be part of the Amazon customer support team calling about an issue with an order or a notice of a security breach. The scammer then attempts to gain your personal information (like your Amazon account username and password or credit card information) by claiming that this information is necessary to resolve the issue.\n\nSamples of Amazon scam calls\n\nBelow are transcripts of actual Amazon scam calls. These are from the Hiya honeypot: a collection of Hiya-owned phone numbers used to capture the content of scam and nuisance calls. Here is the wording of the three most common Amazon scam calls observed by Hiya:\n\n“Hello. This is Amazon. This call is to authorize a payment of $999. We would like to inform you that there is an order placed for an Apple iPhone 11 Pro using your Amazon account. If you do not authorize this order press 1, or press 2 to authorize this order.\n\n“This is a confirmation call from Amazon regarding your purchase of iPhone 13 Pro Max and Apple Airpods, totaling $1499. But we have found some suspicious activities in your account while processing the payment. So in order to cancel your order, kindly press 1 to speak with the Amazon fraud department.”\n\n“Hello. Amazon Express notice. A courier delivered twice and no one has signed for it. For details, please press 1.”\n\nEach call has a common element: the robocall asks the recipient to press a number, which will connect with a phony Amazon representative. Instead of wasting time making live calls, the scammers start with a robocall, and if the recipient falls for the scam and presses a number, a live operator will attempt to get the victim to reveal their Amazon account information or credit card number.\n\nReports from Hiya users\n\nIn addition to the honeypot, Hiya also receives user reports from consumers using Hiya Protect via their carrier, device manufacturer, or the Hiya mobile app. Here’s a sampling of the Amazon scam calls users are reporting:\n\n“Multiple calls from multiple numbers to convince me to let them help with a fraudulent purchase on Amazon.”\n\n“Claims to be from Amazon. Usually, a message that wants you to call them back about an order, then they try to pump you for information.”\n\n“Claiming to be Amazon to renew a monthly fee of $99 per month. If you speak to a consultant to cancel, they request your bank details to stop the payment.”\n\nHow to protect against scam calls\n\nCarriers can add Hiya Protect, a complete call protection solution that enables carriers to protect their subscribers by blocking and labeling spam calls, and helping them identify wanted calls. Hiya Protect recently added a new layer of protection, Personal AI, which personalizes call protection to individual subscribers so they receive the calls that are important to them and are protected from targeted attacks.\n\nWith Hiya Connect, enterprises can improve customer engagement and loyalty while protecting their customers from deceitful interactions and their brand reputation from inaccurate spam labeling. Get a free Reputation Analysis report to see if your customers are at risk.\n\nIndividuals can check with their phone carrier to see if it offers any spam/scam-blocking capabilities. If not, ask your carrier to consider adding Hiya Protect.",
      "# [What is enterprise branded call? Display a branded caller ID | Hiya by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/branded-call)\nWe’ve all had the experience of seeing an unknown number pop up on our phones. Without thinking, we answer the call, only to hear, “[car warranty scam beginning.]” The frustration we feel from this spam call, coupled with the frequency we experience it, leaves us with a sour taste in our mouths. It’s no wonder 87% of consumers believe unidentified calls may be fraudulent. And for call centers that regularly make outbound calls, this has detrimental effects.\n\nThat’s why branding your calls with your business name is so important. With a Branded Call, the caller ID displays a caller’s company name, location, logo, and other identifiable information before the call even starts. Instead of seeing “unknown caller” and worrying about the nuisance of a potential spam call, a Branded Call allows customers to identify and trust the source of a call immediately.\n\nLet your customers know you're calling. With branded caller ID, display your company name, logo, and location to engage with more people, faster.\n\nBenefits of enterprise branded caller ID\n\nAlthough agencies like the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are trying to use their resources to stop the exponential increase in spam calls, they’re simply aren't given enough to respond to the rapidly evolving scam tactics deployed by scammers.\n\nTrust\n\nWhen consumers cannot trust the calls coming from your business, it starts affecting their perception of your brand. Imagine you are waiting for a call from your food delivery service on the status of your order. Time goes by and you haven’t received an update. You’d be pretty frustrated and your confidence in the company would plummet. While the delivery driver could have been calling you all along, you didn’t answer the calls because you didn’t know who was calling. As more and more customers stop answering their phones for unidentified calls, this damaged reputation can snowball into massive losses as customers choose other delivery services.\n\nSecurity and spam\n\nFraudsters are always ready and willing to impersonate well-known companies—and with people more connected to their phones than ever before, telecom scams are their method of choice. But with Hiya’s Branded Call, by providing your company name and logo, you can assure your customers that your call is legitimate. Hiya also offers Secure Call, an additional feature that pre-authenticates outbound calls before they are made, securing your branded caller identity, and protecting your customers from falling victim to fraudsters using your numbers.\n\nBranding\n\nThe customer's experience of the call will influence whether they have a positive or negative perception of your business. A Branded Call will help create a visual experience that draws the customer in and increases their positive association with the business and its call center. Word of mouth is a powerful marketing vehicle, so it is important to remember that positive interactions often lead customers to spread the word.\n\nIncrease answer rates\n\nImagine you get two calls—one says “unknown number” and the other says a company’s name. Which one are you going to answer? Call centers with a branded caller ID through Hiya report an average 80% increase in answer rates. Customers pick up the phone when they know who’s calling.\n\nWhat are the risks of not having an enterprise branded caller ID?\n\nAt this point, you should be quite familiar with the fact that branded caller ID can improve the efforts of your contact center dramatically. But what are the risks associated with not having a Branded Call? Consider the following:\n\nUnanswered calls\n\nWhat do most people do when they encounter an unknown number? They ignore the call. According to Hiya's State of the Call survey, 84% of consumers think an unidentified call is fraudulent. As a result of being unable to communicate essential information to your customers, your company’s bottom line will suffer.\n\nThe challenges of unidentified calls\n\nIn today's digital age, trust is paramount. When a call comes in without a clear indicator of who is calling, many consumers hesitate to answer, fearing potential scams or unwanted solicitations. Imagine eagerly awaiting an update on your food delivery order. Minutes turn into hours, and there's no word. Your frustration mounts, and your trust in the service wanes. Unbeknownst to you, the delivery driver may have been trying to reach you, but their calls went unanswered because there was no clear indication of who was on the other end. This scenario is becoming increasingly common as more individuals opt to ignore unidentified calls. As this trend continues, businesses face the risk of eroding customer trust and loyalty, potentially leading to significant losses as customers turn to competitors with clearer communication channels.\n\nHow Hiya can help\n\nWant to know how you can brand your business name on your outbound calls? calling an iPhone or Android? Getting Hiya Connect can help you change your caller ID to accurately identify and increase your answer rates. The Branded Call feature helps call centers display their company name, logo, and reason for calling. This will help your business contact the right individuals while building trust in your brand. Hiya’s Voice Performance Platform also gives you the ability to:\n\nTrack the impact of Branded Call over time\n\nMonitor your caller reputation health\n\nUnderstand why calls have been blocked or reported\n\nSecure calls and prevent number hijacking",
      "# [You’re A Mean One Mr. Grinch…Or Should We Say Holiday Scammers by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/holiday-scammers/)\nThanksgiving may be over, but just because you put away your “Thanksgiving pants,” doesn’t mean you shouldn’t prepare yourself for the next wave of holiday madness coming your way.\n\nFrom online shopping to searching for holiday jobs to giving to the less fortunate, our good deeds are like a double-edged sword. Scammers have caught on to our holiday habits and are using it to their advantage but unfortunately, it’s also to our demise. Here are a few scams you should keep an eye out for this holiday season that will help you gain back the upper hand:\n\nCharity Scam\n\nThe holidays are a time for giving, and as we plan to make generous donations, you may have already been victim to a number of requests from a variety of “organizations”. Unfortunately, charity scams have seen a 50% increase from November 2015 to November 2016.\n\nScammers are disguising themselves as “charities” to take advantage of you while you’re in the giving spirit. They will either request personal or financial information (which legitimate charities will never ask for) and most likely a small percentage (if you’re lucky) or none of your donation will go to the cause you are trying to help.\n\nGift Card Scam\n\nWe’re all familiar with gift card scammers tricking us into paying past due bills and overdue taxes with gift cards but during the holiday season, it’s all about tricking us into selling them our unwanted gift cards.\n\nThere are a variety of gift card scams out there and because of them, it’s not a surprise that from October 2015 to October 2016, there was a 58.19% increase and from January 2016 to October 2016 alone there was a 43.21% increase in the scam.\n\nGift cards are a simple yet easy gift, but we don’t always get the ones we ask for. Just about everything sells online including gift cards and this holiday season we’re likely to do just that. When making an offer on a gift card, scammers will demand the seller confirm the balance on the card by calling the merchant on a three-way call. While the seller enters the gift card number, the scammer records the touch-tone numbers entered to intercept the gift card number. Then, scammers will use the gift card without paying for it. Make sure to sell unwanted gift cards to reputable gift card resellers, or to a gift card exchange kiosk (i.e. Coinstar.)\n\nHoliday (Vacation) Scam\n\nWho can resist a vacation, but even more who can resist a “FREE” holiday vacation! It’s apparent that the word “FREE’ has been getting the best of us since these types of scams have gone up 69% from October 2015 to November 2016.\n\nA majority of vacation scams start with a phone call promising an unbelievable prize from a raffle or survey you may (or may not) have entered. As you rack your brain wondering what you may have unknowingly entered, you can’t help but feel that what they’re offering is too good to be true. If you’re getting that gut feeling, it probably is.\n\nPackage Delivery Scam\n\nIt’s always a wonderful surprise to find a package from Uncle Bob or Aunt Sue on your front porch during the holiday season, but don’t let the flood of gifts catch you off-guard when you get a text telling you that you have a package “waiting” for you.\n\nThese types of “packages” can come as a notice claiming you’ve won a prize, or a SMiShing link that you’ve received a package and all you have to do is “click the link” to find the status of its delivery. Don’t fall for it! Scammers are taking advantage of your gift-receiving vulnerability to get you to click on links that will download software to help them steal your personal and financial information.\n\nOnline Shopping Scam\n\nWe know that despite it being the time of giving, gifts can add up. So, when we can find a killer deal on something, we tend to seize the opportunity. However, when these opportunities seem too good to be true, know that they usually are.\n\nFrom social media to Craigslist, scammers are reeling in victims with deals they know shoppers won’t want to miss. They request payment and before the buyer can receive what they’ve paid for, the seller has already run with their money before victims realize they’ve been had. Do your due diligence and shop from accredited stores or make sure you know who you’re wheeling and dealing with before you hand over your whole holiday budget.\n\nHoliday Employment\n\nUnfortunately, this doesn’t only happen during the holiday season but all year round. However, during the holidays, a number of us are looking to make some extra cash with seasonal jobs. Due to popular demand, scammers are creating fake job listings to swipe personal and financial information from unknowing job candidates by requesting social security numbers and bank account numbers and conducting fake background checks.\n\nIf you ever receive these types of calls or feel you’re being victimized, it’s best to hang up the phone and do some research on the organization. Call the organization directly to make sure that it is a legitimate business. If the call was a scam, report the call to the FCC.\n\nHappy Holidays!",

      "# [What Are Sales Optimization Best Practices? by Alicia Marie Beatty](https://blog.hiya.com/sales-optimizations)\nOptimizing your call performance strategy can be a difficult, arduous task--made even worse if your team is constantly hiring and training new agents. Many managers find it difficult to focus their team’s efforts on activities that will maximize revenue. We’ve been there, and we’re here to help.\n\nThe word “optimization” is used so frequently in business conversations that the meaning often becomes masked by other definitions. Managers will frequently, mistakenly use “optimize” in lieu of other, more appropriate words like “growth” or “high performance.” And though these definitions may appear to be quite similar, using the words interchangeably will cause your sales team to miss out on golden opportunities.\n\nIn this article, we’re taking a minute to break down what sales optimization really is, why it’s critical for your success, and how you can begin implementing best practices today.\n\nWhat Is Sales Optimization?\n\nSales optimization is the process of analyzing and improving sales performance to achieve maximum revenue. Good managers evaluate the performance of sales teams and provide training to help agents develop skills that lead to wins.\n\nOptimizations are important in every industry, but it especially applies to the work done in contact centers. Because outbound calls are so repetitive, it can be easy for agents to develop bad habits through lack of focus. Optimization occurs when agents consistently use best practices to increase the likelihood of closing sales.\n\nOptimization Best Practices\n\nThere are many things that contact centers can do to maximize their sales revenue. Here are three ways to take your optimization strategy to the next level:\n\n1. Set Long Term Goals\n\nSince sales optimization is all about choosing the most efficient path to success, it’s important to start by visualizing your end goal. Set goals based on yearly revenue and sales, and keep those goals top of mind.\n\nA common misstep: call center teams tend to focus more on short-term goals than they do on long-term goals. Weekly, monthly, and quarterly goals are only useful if they provide a clear path to achieving long-term business goals. Because sales optimization is all about adjusting performance over time, you’ll need to be careful to not get so focused on hitting this quarter’s numbers that you forget about the bigger picture.\n\nSome managers find it difficult to create lasting, measurable goals, instead opting for short-term goals that are easy to achieve. This is understandable, since long-term goals are usually more high-level and difficult to track. Although they are typically more difficult to track, long-term goals can be, and usually are, more closely aligned with the call center’s mission statement than short-term goals. However, it is impossible to optimize for long-term goals without having a way to measure performance metrics. In short, make sure your goals are tied to a measurable KPI that can be tracked. An example of this might be, ”increase sales by 13% by the end of Q3.” This example hits the sweet spot between setting a goal for your team without being prescriptive or restrictive about the ways in which they go about achieving that goal—creating focus, and allowing for innovation to discover new methods of optimization along the way.\n\n2. Use A Voice Performance Platform for Sales Optimization\n\nSales optimization platforms (like Hiya’s Voice Performance Platform) provide all the tools you need to successfully implement software sales strategies. With these tools for data collection and analysis (and, on a premiere software like Hiya, customized insights) you can stay on track for reaching your long-term goals. Good platforms will also include solutions to common problems call centers face, such as security, reputation management, audience analysis data, and more.\n\nWhen deciding on a voice performance platform, pay attention to what’s offered; is the software cloud-based? Does it contain fraud filters? And is the data self-service, on demand, and accessible 24/7? Sales optimization platforms that include these features can be far more valuable than standard, static caller registries, as they go beyond the basic information provided by your dialer. Choose a platform that will best meet your company’s needs and help you achieve your long-term goals.\n\n3. Make Data-Driven Decisions\n\nThe best sales processes always include an emphasis on tracking and analyzing data which allows managers to make decisions based on actionable insights. While everything up to this point has been important, this step is where the most tangible, significant results happen.\n\nMaking business decisions that are rooted in data does two things to your sales performance. First, it gives you an imperial metric to guide you in an industry that is all too frequently subjective. You can’t fool numbers. Second, it gives you a way to measure the efficacy of your initiatives. Many sales optimization platforms, such as Hiya’s Voice Performance Platform, will allow you to identify lead quality -- an invaluable resource for your agents. While it’s not an exact science, if your decisions aren’t backed by data and tracked in an organized manner, you’ll have no idea if an initiative is making an impact.\n\nAs you track your team’s performance, pay attention to trends in data. For example, if you notice a sudden drop in answer rates, it may be a sign that an imposter is spoofing your calls. No amount of training your agents will improve that metric. Once you’ve discovered a spoofing problem, you can take action by securing your calls and giving customers the confidence to answer. Fortunately, many sales optimization platforms, including Hiya Connect, can help notify you when problems like this arise and can solve them before they have a chance to negatively impact performance.\n\nUsing Hiya Connect for Sales Optimization\n\nHiya Connect, a Voice Performance Platform, is the industry-leading platform for performance analytics. Its intuitive dashboard integrates all of your metrics in one platform, allowing for a clear, comprehensive view of your performance. Hiya also provides data-driven insights to give you actionable steps to improve call performance. These are a few examples of how Hiya Connect can help you reach your optimization goals.\n\nCall centers may come across a sudden decline in answer rates, which may signify an imposter attempting to spoof your calls. Customers become conditioned to not pick up the phone anymore after they’ve received spam calls from numbers that look similar to your business numbers. Hiya Connect protects against spam labels and secures network connections, so you will never have to face this issue again.\n\nWhat if your answer rates were never high to begin with? Hiya Connect provides call centers with branded calls, which display your company name, logo, and a custom, informative reason for calling. Answer rates increase significantly when the prospect knows the identity of the caller.",
      "# [Evolution of Phones and its Affect on Society by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/telephone-transformation/)\nThe smartphones we possess today have come a long way from the first rendition of the telephone back in 1876 when Alexander Graham Bell invented and patented the first short-range phone. But like people, phones have evolved throughout history to cater to our lifestyles and needs.\n\nHere’s a look at how telephones have transformed over the years…\n\nShort-Range Phone: Despite a number of individuals from around the world who’ve contributed to the invention of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell was the first to receive a patent for his short-range phone in 1876. Testing out the phone in his Boston laboratory, he rang his assistant Thomas Watson, and become well known-for saying, “Mr. Watson, come here – I want to see you.”\n\nCandlestick Phone: The candlestick phone became popular in the 1890s through the 1930s. Separated by two pieces, it featured a mouth piece (transmitter) mounted at the top of the stand, and a receiver (ear phone) that the user would hold to their ear during a call.\n\nRotary Phone: Pushing out the candlestick phone, the rotary phone came about in the 1930s when manufacturers began to combine the mouth piece and receiver of the candlestick phones into a single unit. When dialing a rotary phone, what originally started as lugs, but evolved into holes, one would then rotate the dial to the number that they wanted and then would release the dial.\n\nTouch-Dial Phone: On November 18, 1963, the Bell System unveiled the first electronic touch-dial phone system with touch-tone dialing. It would become the worldwide standard for telecommunication signaling. Using audible tones for each of the digits on the push-button keypad, specific frequencies were designated to each row and column. The tones helped the switching center determine which key was pressed.\n\nFirst Mobile Phone: On April 3, 1973, Motorola researcher and executive, Martin Cooper, made the first mobile telephone from handheld subscriber equipment. Weighing in at 2.4 lbs and measuring at 228.6 x 127 x 44.4mm, Cooper was said to have called a rival telecommunications company and let them know he was talking to them on a mobile phone. The prototype was able to give a caller 30 minutes of talk-time and took about 10 hours to charge.\n\nCordless Phone: Cordless phones became a hot commodity in the 1980s but was originally invented by a female Jazz musician named Teri Pall in 1965. The handset cord of the telephone was replaced with a radio link. However, Teri’s invention would not hit the consumer market until a decade and a half later.\n\nFirst Portable Phone: Even though Martin Cooper invented the first mobile phone, the first portable mobile phone was the MicroTAC which was introduced in 1989 as “an innovative new “flip” design”, where the “mouthpiece” folded over the keypad, although the “mouthpiece” was actually located in the base of the phone, along with the ringer. Up until its release, most cellular phones were installed as car phones due to the inability to fit them into a jacket pocket.\n\nNokia: Through the mid-90s and into the early 2000s, Nokia mobile phones catered to consumers, with interchangeable faceplates, customizable designs, the first WAP browser, internal antenna, T9 Text messaging, and eventually an LCD screen and internet connectivity.\n\nFirst Camera Phone (Sanyo SCP-5300): Possessing the first camera phone, the U.S. finally adopted the Japanese trend in November 2002. The clunky clamshell design could capture photos at 640×480 pixels and had a basic flash, white balance control, self-timer, digital zoom, and various filters (sepia, black and white, and negative colors.)\n\nCrack-Berry (BlackBerry): Blackberry made waves with their popular RIM communication device in 2003 which possessed a phone, PDA, and e-mail system all in one hand-held phone. The term crack-berry came about when users constantly checked their e-mail and sent short messages through their device.\n\nSleek Mobile Design (Motorola Razr): First developed in 2003, the Motorola Razr hit it big when it was marketed as a fashion phone due to its sleek and thin profile. Over its four-year run, they sold over a 130 million phones and were named the best-selling clamshell phone in history.\n\nSmartphones: Dating back as far as 1997, it wasn’t until Japan became the first mobile market to popularize the smartphone in 1999. As BlackBerry, Palm, HTC, Windows Mobile, Samsung, Nokia, and Motorola made a name for themselves in the early 2000s, their smartphones had the capability to email, fax, and search the internet. As the smartphone craze escalated, cell phone manufacturers tested a number of functionalities that would help them capitalize on the new trend. From sliding, flipping, rotating, vertical, and even multiple keyboards, touchscreen smartphones made their way into the market which also introduce the stylus. However, the functionality these phones offered were still targeting more business users versus consumers.\n\nCue in iPhone 3G. The first of its kind, the original iPhone was the first touch-screen smartphone that was unveiled in June 2007. Apple’s take on the smartphone combines “multimedia functions with the same email and Web browsing features as all other smartphones previously had. It had a large color display with a capacitive digitizer, and its user interface was finally finger-friendly. And unlike phones before it, the iPhone had only one button on its face – the Home button – and three around its edges, two for volume up/down and one for power/standby.” reports the “The Evolution of the Smartphone” from PocketNow.\n\nToday, iPhone has paved the way for a number of other cell phone manufacturers to create their own version of the smartphones we love today. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg on how phones have evolved over history, but it’s apparent that as phones change, engineers will cater to the needs of consumers. What do you think the evolution of phones will come up with next?\n\nKeep on top of all the trends in Voice with Hiya's State of the Call report below.",

      "# [iPhone FAQ](https://www.hiya.com/faq-ios)\nGetting Started\n\nWhere can I learn more about using Hiya?\n\nYou can learn more at our Help Center here.\n\nHiya is not working correctly. What is one thing I can try before I try anything else? (The Fail Safe)\n\nThe fail-safe: Consider the fail-safe the app version of calling IT Support and them asking if you restarted your computer.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that when you uninstall the app, you will lose the numbers in your blocklist. With that said, use this as a last resort if you have an extensive blocklist. (“Save Blocklist” functionality is a popular request and we are looking into it for future updates).\n\nDisable Hiya in Settings\n\nForce-quit Settings\n\nUninstall Hiya\n\nRestart your device\n\nReinstall Hiya\n\nThe enable Hiya option in the iPhone settings is not working. What do I do?\n\nFirst, our latest update on iOS has experienced issues with enabling and/or updating. We have been in communication with Apple and this is a known bug. Apple offered a workaround that seems to work (and it doesn’t require an uninstall of Hiya which causes you to lose your blocklist). So, if you are experiencing issues after updating to the latest version, please try this:\n\nWait at least one hour after Hiya gets into a bad state. Reboot the phone, then try to enable Hiya again and it should correct itself.\n\nIf this doesn't work then try the fail-safe just above.\n\nMy Caller ID name is wrong. How do I change it?\n\nIf you notice your number is incorrectly labeled as spam, or you notice that wrong information is shown or missing from your own number or someone else’s or, if you would like to remove your information from our services altogether, please click here and we can help you.\n\nHow do I report inaccurate or offensive comments?\n\nIf your number has inaccurate or offensive comments please follow the steps on this linked form and we can look into getting them removed for you.\n\nI have been waiting for the activation code but have yet to receive it. What gives?\n\nWe use Facebook Account Kit for our SMS code verification. Unfortunately, we have no control over whether it works or not. With that said, we want it to work as much as you do. Here are a few tips that may help:\n\nTry the fail-safe (noted at the top of the article).\n\nMake sure you have “United States (+1)” selected (assuming your phone is, indeed, a U.S. number)\n\nOnly use numbers, don’t start with 1 or +1\n\nEnsure your device is subscribed to a texting plan and can receive short-code messages. This one sounds obvious, but we’ve had a few instances where users (and even one of our own developers!) had short-code text messages auto-disabled through their carrier. If you aren’t receiving activation codes, it is worth a call to your carrier to ensure you’re supported.\n\nCall Blocking\n\nHow can I block Spoofed Calls / Neighbor Scam (calls that show as my area code and prefix) on Hiya?\n\nThere is a way to block spoofed calls in the iPhone app. In the Hiya app, tap on options in the bottom right, then scroll down to the Spoofed Calls / Neighbor Scam option and choose block. You can also choose to alert instead of block.\n\nPlease be aware that the block option will block all calls with your area code and your prefix. Even those in your contact list. This is something that we will fix in the next release in the next couple of weeks. In the meantime, the alert option is probably your best bet.\n\nWhy is the iPhone app blocking a contact from calling me?\n\nDo you have a contact in your iPhone that is blocked from calling you and you're not sure why? You might have to change a setting to fix it.\n\nIn the Hiya app, tap on Options in the bottom right, then scroll down to the Spoofed Calls / Neighbor Scam option and choose Alert or Do Nothing. The block option for spoofed calls will block all calls with your area code and your prefix. Even those in your contact list. This is something that we will fix in our next iPhone release. In the meantime, the alert option is probably the best bet.\n\nIs there a way to prevent blocked calls from going to voicemail?\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot prevent blocked calls from going to voicemail. This is a limitation from Apple that prevents us from hanging up on blocked calls. As soon as Apple lifts this limitation, we will eagerly make it available. We want to hang up on them as well.\n\nIs there a way to see calls that have been blocked?\n\nUnfortunately, not. This is another implementation detail from Apple that we can’t work around (we can provide a blocked calls list with Android). We have no idea why we can’t have a “Hey! We’re awesome and here’s a list of calls we’ve blocked for you” section somewhere. The day that changes is the day you’ll see it.\n\nIs there any way to block all unknown caller ID/private callers?\n\nUnfortunately, there’s no way to block all unknown callers, in the app or iPhone itself. We can only block an actual number that is recognized by caller ID. Android has some cool features like block by area code, but at this time, we can’t provide that feature on iPhone.\n\nIn iOS is there a way to import or export the block list after un/reinstalling?\n\nWe don’t have a “save block list” function right now… However, it is a popular request so we are looking into it.\n\nProtection\n\nHow do I use Hiya to look up unknown numbers?\n\nFirst copy the unknown number from your Recents within the Phone application and then open Hiya. Hiya will ask you if you want to identify the number you just copied. Tap “yes” and Hiya will look up the number for you.\n\nWhat are the steps for copying phone numbers?\n\nTo copy a phone number, go to your Recent calls within the iPhone Phone application and tap on the info icon (the “i” with a circle around it) for the number you wish to look up. Once you’re on the contact card, press the caller's number and hold it for a couple seconds. The option to copy the number will appear. Tap “Copy” and the number is ready for you to paste into other apps.\n\nHow do I look up numbers with the widget (iOS 8 and above only)?\n\nFirst install the Hiya widget. To install the widget, pull down the Notification Center. Make sure you are on the “Today” tab. Scroll to the bottom and tap “Edit.” You will be shown a list of apps that have widgets available. Tap on Hiya to add the widget.\n\nNext, copy the number you want to look up from your Recent Call Log. Pull down the Notification Center and scroll to the Hiya widget. The phone number will be automatically identified there.\n\nHow does Hiya identify incoming scam and spam calls?\n\nHiya adds an address book entry containing hundreds of phone numbers for known-to-be spammers and scammers. Because scammers and spammers are constantly changing their phone numbers to avoid detection, we update our entries at least once a day, often more.\n\nWhy does an inbound call not get marked as spam, even if Hiya reports show it as a spam number?\n\nThere are a few things here.\n\n#1) Our database of spammers is gigantic. Unfortunately, we are not able to enter every single spam number in the world into CallKit. We have to be picky and so we choose only the spam numbers that we have the highest confidence in to ID on the incoming call. For the remaining numbers, sometimes you’ll have to manually look them up in the app to see if they are Suspected Spam or not.\n\n#2) When a call comes in, we look up the number to see if it’s spam. Usually, it takes less than one second, but sometimes it simply takes longer and calls can get through.\n\nI have installed the app, but so far no calls have been identified….?\n\nIf calls are not being identified at all when you get them, then something has probably gone wrong. A simple check is to see if any calls are identified in the native phone call log. You should see some Hiya entries in there if it’s working.\n\nIf not, revert to the fail-safe (see above) and then, go back into the app, in the Call Protection tab, click on “Update Now” and give it about a minute to update, then check the call log again.\n\nAre spam numbers updated in the background or do I have to manually launch the app occasionally to update?\n\nIf you enable Hiya (through the phone's Settings> Phone> Call Blocking and Identification), then our spam lists will update in the background. Leading to our next ever-popular question…\n\nI enabled Hiya in the phone's settings, why does the app continually tell me I need to go in and update (by showing a red dot on the app icon)?\n\nAnytime the spam list updates, you will receive a badge notification on the Hiya icon. This is to let you know that it’s working and updating. If you prefer not to see this, you can disable badge icons in your Settings (the spam lists will still continue to update, you just won’t be notified as such).\n\nTo disable badge icons follow these steps: Go into your settings for the iPhone itself. Go to Settings> Notifications> Hiya> and then disable “Badge App Icon.”\n\nWhy do the number of scam and spam calls I am protected from keep changing?\n\nScammers and spammers are constantly changing their phone numbers to avoid being blocked by our app. We update the lists of scammers and spammers at least once a day, as long as the app is active to ensure that you stay protected from unwanted calls. Typically a scammer's number will only be active for 2-5 days before it is shut down by it's own provider. When a number is shutdown and deactivated we take it off of the total blocked list.\n\nWhat is the difference between scam calls, spam calls and blacklisted calls?\n\nScams are calls trying to get you to send them money or are found to be fraud in some other way. Spam calls are calls from telemarketers, bill collectors, solicitors, etc. Spam is not dangerous, but can be very annoying. Blacklisted calls are from numbers that you choose to blacklist because you want them blocked. This is someone such as an ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend or anyone you just don’t want to talk to.\n\nHow do I use the spam check dialer?\n\nGo to the “Call” tab in the app and type in the phone number you want to dial. If no spam is detected, then the call will go through. If the number you are dialing is identified as spam, you will be warned and asked if you want to continue with the call.\n\nDoes the “real-time” notification only work over wifi or 3g?\n\nHiya doesn’t require any network connection; if you can receive a phone call, it works! You will only need a connection to update the Spam numbers list.\n\nPrivacy\n\nWhy do you need access to my contacts?\n\nUpon signing up for Hiya, you agree to share your contacts, but we keep all contact data private and don’t sell it to third parties or use it to market to your contacts. Because we’re not awful human beings. More information can be found here.\n\nIs giving you access to my contact list still necessary?\n\nFor full functionality, yes. We use it for the smart dialer, to autocomplete suggestions, to whitelist spam functionality, for sharing functionality and for adding to block list functionality. With that said, you don’t have to grant contacts permission, but the app will have some limited operation.\n\nDo you have access to my call logs on the iPhone?\n\nWe do not have access to call logs on the iPhone.\n\nHow do you keep contact information private if you use Facebook?\n\nFacebook is used only for login, it’s optional, and nothing is shared with Facebook. Facebook AccountKit is used for phone verification. It does not require a Facebook account, it only verifies the phone number.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nHiya is still not working correctly. What is one thing I can try after I try have tried everything else? (The Fail Safe)\n\nThe fail-safe: Consider the fail-safe the app version of calling IT Support and them asking if you restarted your computer.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that when you uninstall the app, you will lose the numbers in your blocklist. With that said, use this as a last resort if you have an extensive blocklist. (“Save Blocklist” functionality is a popular request and we are looking into it for future updates).\n\nDisable Hiya in Settings\n\nForce-quit Settings\n\nUninstall Hiya\n\nRestart your device\n\nReinstall Hiya\n\nI have been waiting for the activation code but have yet to receive it. What gives?\n\nWe use Facebook Account Kit for our SMS code verification. Unfortunately, we have no control over whether it works or not. With that said, we want it to work as much as you do. Here are a few tips that may help:\n\nTry the fail-safe (noted at the top of the article).\n\nMake sure you have “United States (+1)” selected (assuming your phone is, indeed, a U.S. number)\n\nOnly use numbers, don’t start with 1 or +1\n\nEnsure your device is subscribed to a texting plan and can receive short-code messages. This one sounds obvious, but we’ve had a few instances where users (and even one of our own developers!) had short-code text messages auto-disabled through their carrier. If you aren’t receiving activation codes, it is worth a call to your carrier to ensure you’re supported.\n\nWhy am I not seeing “Hiya” in Settings>Phone>Call Blocking & Identification?\n\nFirst, our latest update on iOS has experienced issues with enabling and/or updating. We have been in communication with Apple and this is a known bug. Apple offered a workaround that seems to work (and it doesn’t require an uninstall of Hiya which causes you to lose your blocklist). So, if you are experiencing issues after updating to the latest version, please try this:\n\nWait more than one hour after Hiya gets into a bad state. Reboot the phone, then try to enable Hiya again and it should correct itself.\n\nIf this doesn't work then try the fail-safe at the beginning of the FAQ.\n\nHow do you uninstall Hiya?\n\nTo remove Hiya from your iPhone:\n\nOpen the app and tap \"Protect\" at the bottom.\n\nTap the \"Enable Call Protection\" slider so that Call Protection is disabled. This will remove the \"Suspected Spam\", \"Scam or Fraud\", and \"Blacklisted\" contacts that the app uses for Spam/Scam identification.\n\nExit the app and long-press the app icon.\n\nAn \"x\" will appear in one corner. Tap the \"x\" to completely uninstall.\n\nI've uninstalled Hiya but why do calls still seem to be getting blocked?\n\nIf you are still having issues after uninstalling Hiya you might have to reinstall the app and then try these steps:\n\nDisable Hiya in the iPhone Settings (Settings->Phone->Call Blocking & Identification)\n\nForce-quit Settings\n\nUninstall Hiya\n\nRestart your device\n\nThe Hiya widget doesn’t appear as a choice on Notifications.\n\nIf you’ve already tried the fail-safe (see above), let’s give this a whirl instead: Pull down the notification center by swiping down from the top of the screen. Swipe right to bring up the widgets page, scroll to the bottom. Tap the circular “edit” button, and tap the “+” button next to Hiya.\n\nHelp\n\nHow can I give feedback?\n\nWe'd love to hear from you.

      "# [Get your questions about Spam answered](https://work.hiya.com/why-spam)\nCommon questions we hear:\n\nWhy is my businesses phone number showing up as spam?\n\nSpam labels are applied by carriers who want to protect you from scam and spam calls.\n\nIf the data shows that your calls are unwanted by your recipients, either through high abandon rates, blocks, or being reported as spam (among other datapoints), your calls are more likely to be delivered with a “spam likely” label. Mobile carriers are constantly monitoring additional datapoints, working to fight the ever evolving scam tactics used by spammers and scammers.\n\nHow can I check if my outbound caller id is showing as spam?\n\nUse a service like Hiya’s Cross Carrier Call Inspection to see how your calls are displayed across carriers and devices. If you are ready to check your numbers, fill out the form below and our team will reach out to get a list of numbers to perform the audit.\n\nSome businesses do use a revolving door of phone numbers, rotating through them to attempt to evade these labels, rather than understanding the call practices that led to this labeling in the first place. If you think your phone numbers are showing up as spam, a call inspection is the first step. Then Hiya can guide you through the next steps in getting your calls delivered with an identity that matches your business.\n\nHow often do people answer calls with a spam identity?\n\nIn short: they don’t. And as nuisance calls increase in frequency, the likelihood of someone answering a spam or unidentified number is plummeting.\n\nEven without a spam label, 87% of consumers think an unidentified number may be fraudulent. And if a consumer receives a call impersonating your business, 73% of consumers struggle to trust that business ever again.\n\nWhy is Hiya different?\n\nWe work with our customers to ensure that they are prepared to get the most out of their voice channel today, and far into the future.\n\nWe also work directly with the carriers to understand the future of best call practices, and ensure our customers are acting on these long term plans for getting their calls answered. Unlike competitors, we know services like number rotation or spam mitigation isn't a long term solution. Having a branded identity on your calls alongside good call practices are the only way to build trust over the voice channel and get your calls answered again.",

      "# [Beyond CATI: Making Real Connections with Voice by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/beyond-cati)\nComputer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) is a technology that saves time and increases response rates for companies that use telephone surveys for marketing research and other interview-based initiatives.\n\nCATI works just as the name implies – a live person uses a computer as an aid in interviews using an automated script. As the interviewer gets a response from the person on the phone, the answers are inputted into the computer to be used as data for analysis and outputs such as statistics, trends, patterns, and other market research.\n\nFor surveys and similar marketing programs, CATI works great and adds significant speed and value to data capture. For instance, when a person answers yes or no to a question, the CATI software will automatically provide the interviewer with the appropriate next question. A “yes” response may result in further questions that dig deeper, while a “no” response may initiate an action to end the survey with a thank you.\n\nThe pitfall: No real human interaction or intelligence added\n\nCATI certainly serves a purpose in market research and accelerates the collection of survey data, but it leaves little room for relationship building. Nor does it facilitate a deeper collection of insights that can only come from an interactive conversation between two live people.\n\nThe humanizing factor in voice calls allows the person initiating the call to:\n\nBuild a real connection. In a free-form conversation, the caller has the immediate opportunity to start building a relationship with the person on the receiving end.\n\n“Hear” emotion. Empathy is something that is only achievable in a free-form voice call, and the ability to hear the emotion of the person called is critical, especially if the person is an unhappy or frustrated customer.\n\nDiscover the unexpected. When there is a precise script to be followed, like in CATI software-driven calls, the caller is unable to change gears when the person being called says something unexpected. In a free-form call, the caller can respond directly and intelligently to provide better customer service.\n\nBeyond the humanizing touch, a voice call can bring, there are many other bottom-line benefits as well, such as increased sales, opportunities for upsells, improved customer loyalty, and best of all, greater revenue generation.\n\nIncreasing the opportunity for real connections\n\nWith the help of a branded call solution like Hiya Connect, callers can start building real connections immediately. Branded calling sets the stage for high-quality humanizing calls because a customer or prospect can see who is calling – and the reason for the call – even before the call is even answered. With this advantage, calls get answered more frequently, often on the first attempt, improving connection rates.\n\nThe personalization of a branded call also helps keep people on the phone longer, with more engagement and better bottom-line results.\n\nStart humanizing your calls today",

      "# [What Is a Robocall and How Do They Impact Business? by Laleh Hassibi](https://blog.hiya.com/robocalls-explained)\nUnexpected and often unplanned, random telephone calls throughout the day pull you and your employees away from vital tasks. But while these calls may be disruptive, they are often a necessary part of doing business. After all, customers, remote employees, vendors, and others need to be able to connect with you, even if that means occasionally pulling you away from other tasks.\n\nBut what about when the person on the other end isn’t a person at all?\n\nRobocalls are the worst. When you set everything aside to answer a ringing phone, only to be met with a prerecorded, robotic message, there is no upside. And on a larger scale, these calls are also harming businesses’ ability to effectively reach out and connect with consumers. To combat robocalls, as well as the scams, spam, and fraudulent practices they support, you first need to know what’s at stake.\n\nHere, we dive into the reality of robocalls — what they are, how they impact your business, and how to block robocalls once and for all.\n\nWhat is a robocall?\n\nRobocalls (sometimes referred to as automated calls) are calls that deliver a prerecorded voice message. These calls are usually initiated by predictive-dialer computer programs called autodialers. Once the incoming call is answered, the program automatically begins playing the prerecorded message.\n\nMany kinds of robocalls serve legitimate functions. Appointment reminders, emergency notifications, educational institutions reaching out about unexpected absences or school closures — in each of these cases, robocalls allow organizations to deliver important information easily, directly, and automatically.\n\nHowever, robocalls are often put to less legitimate uses.\n\nWhat happens if you answer a robocall?\n\nAnswering a robocall poses various risks to consumers, including confirming to scammers that the phone number is active and owned by a real person. This could potentially lead to more unsolicited calls or texts.\n\nEngaging with robocalls also increases the likelihood of falling victim to scams, including identity theft, financial fraud, and phishing schemes. These calls often employ sophisticated tactics to deceive individuals into divulging sensitive information, from bank details to personal data. Additionally, some robocalls may attempt to install malware or viruses on the recipient’s device, further compromising their privacy and security.\n\nAnswering robocalls can expose consumers to various threats, so it is important to exercise caution and utilize strategies like call blocking to mitigate these risks. Even if consumers answer a robocall, they can use these tips to protect themselves.\n\n1. Hang up\n\nHanging up as soon as possible is important because it immediately severs any potential interaction with the robocall. By ending the call promptly, individuals reduce their exposure to potential scams, fraud, or attempts to gather personal information.\n\n2. Avoid saying “yes”\n\nSaying \"yes\" to a bot in a robocall can have severe consequences. Scammers may record affirmative responses and misuse them to validate transactions, change account settings, or sign up for services without the victim's consent. This tactic can lead to identity theft and unauthorized charges. It can even lead to legal ramifications if the recorded \"yes\" is used to misrepresent agreement to terms or contracts.\n\n3. Don’t follow the instructions\n\nFollowing instructions on a robocall poses significant risks, and these instructions may lead to downloading malware. The instructions could also cause the consumer to provide access to sensitive information or engage in activities that compromise security or privacy. By disobeying these directives, individuals can avoid falling into traps set by scammers.\n\n4. Avoid giving personal information\n\nGiving personal information to a robocaller opens the door to identity theft, financial fraud, and other forms of exploitation. Scammers can use this information to impersonate individuals and access their financial accounts. It's crucial for individuals to never disclose sensitive information such as Social Security numbers or passwords over the phone to unknown entities.\n\n5. Report the call\n\nFinally, reporting robocalls is essential to help authorities track down and take action against scammers. Individuals can report robocalls to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United States or similar regulatory bodies in other countries. Additionally, many phone service providers offer tools or services for reporting and blocking unwanted calls. By reporting robocalls, individuals contribute to efforts to combat telephone scams.\n\nAre robocalls illegal?\n\nRobocalls haven’t gone unnoticed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC); various laws exist to protect individuals and groups from harassment from automated-dialing programs.\n\nThe FTC website says this about robocall legality:\n\n“A robocall trying to sell you something is illegal unless a company has your written permission to call you that way. To get your permission, the company has to be clear it’s asking to call you with robocalls, and it can’t make you agree to the calls to get a product or service. If you give permission, you have the right to change your mind later.”\n\nIn other words, businesses need explicit permission in order to try to sell you products through robocalls. That said, there are certain exceptions. For example, political campaigns and charities asking for donations do not legally require your permission to use robocalls, and neither do debt collection calls or calls from healthcare providers. Additionally, calls that are purely informational without requesting any payment are likewise unrestricted.\n\nCongress recently passed the TRACED, (Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence) Act, which raises the fine on spam robocalls to as much as $10,000 per illegal call. Unfortunately, even with laws on the books designed to deter robocallers, robocalls keep coming.\n\nHiya’s 2021 State of the Call research reports a total of 157.4 billion spam and fraud calls were received in North America and Europe in 2020. And, because so many of these calls consist of spam messages, scams, and illegal sales tactics, the callers have no compunction about reaching out to numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry.\n\nHow robocalls hurt business\n\nIt takes about 23 minutes to recover and refocus after a single work interruption, and employees tend to compensate for interruptions with rushed, less-accurate work. Frequent robocalls hinder productivity and may be costing your business significant amounts of money.\n\nScammers target businesses\n\nIndividuals are not the only ones who can fall victim to robocalls — fraudsters target businesses as well. Google business listing scams are a type of robocall that manipulate payments from businesses by claiming that their listings are incomplete and in danger of being taken down. Local map verification scams swindle businesses into handing over private information.\n\nCall recipients are skeptical\n\nBeyond hurting productivity or tricking businesses out of money or sensitive information, robocalls also have an extremely negative effect on how consumers respond to incoming calls. Approximately 94% of people are now hesitant to answer unidentified calls, and 26% of call recipients have trouble immediately distinguishing automated calls from real human callers. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) even cautions consumers not to answer calls from unknown numbers.\n\nConsumers are becoming increasingly distrustful of calls from unknown numbers. Legitimate businesses are getting reported as spam because the customers don’t know who is calling. To make matters worse, 56% of businesses overall don't actually know whether their calls have been flagged as fraud.\n\nFraudulent calls may be drowning out your ability to connect with your customers. Fortunately, you don’t have to take a passive role in the fight. There are steps you can take to help ensure that all of your communications are trusted by recipients.\n\nHow to prevent robocalls\n\nBusinesses that want to prevent or limit incoming robocalls have similar options to consumers. For one, they can simply not answer unidentified calls, although this still presents a distraction from productive work, and may create problems when important incoming calls fail to provide caller ID information or end up inaccurately flagged as fraudulent.\n\nBusinesses can also use call-blocking systems or third-party apps to intercept automated calls and prevent them from causing distraction. Androids and iPhones include options to automatically stop smartphones from receiving suspicious calls.\n\nAddressing the impact from robocalls on contact-center answer rates demand a more tactful approach. Here are several ways businesses can help ensure calls are getting through to customers.\n\nUse real, assigned numbers, and maintain an accurate caller ID\n\nSome of the criteria carriers look for when flagging, or even automatically blocking, potentially fraudulent calls are invalid or unused numbers. Use real numbers, and provide as much relevant information as possible in your caller ID. This will help prevent the number from being erroneously flagged, and will give customers the information they need to decide whether they wish to answer your call.\n\nUse specific numbers for specific departments and services\n\nIf you’re using the same number for all of your outbound calls, you are more likely to get flagged. This is likely because as consumers see the same phone number showing up with increased frequency, they often mistake that number for a robocaller and report it. Giving each department its own assigned number allows you to reach out to customers without inundating them with too many calls from a single source.\n\nTry to only call assigned numbers\n\nRobocalls thrive by casting a wide net, and often call invalid and unassigned numbers while trying to locate possible human targets. Businesses that frequently make out-going calls to unassigned numbers may catch the attention of telephone carriers, getting flagged in the process.\n\nBe compliant with laws and willing to work with service providers\n\nAnalytics companies and service providers are actively trying to eliminate illegal robocalls. Businesses can help by providing them with documentation detailing regular calling patterns (this should include anticipated call volume as well as standard calling hours). Likewise, adhere to the Do Not Call List and remain compliant with relevant laws and regulations. Provide contact information so that call recipients can report any perceived violations. Taking these steps demonstrates your willingness to help, and further distinguishes your businesses from illegitimate callers and scam artists.\n\nUse Hiya Connect\n\nAs one of the most trusted names in caller identification and blocking, Hiya provides the complete range of tools and services you need to ensure that your calls are getting through to the people who matter. Hiya Connect empowers businesses to register legitimate phone numbers and take increased control over how those numbers appear in caller ID.

      "# [Basics to Know About Call Authentication by Alicia Marie Beatty](https://blog.hiya.com/call-authentication)\nThe massive amount of robocalls are frustrating for everyone involved — customers and contact centers alike. Customers don’t want to answer their phone for robocalls and contact centers are having a difficult time reaching customers because they aren’t picking up the phone. In fact, 94% of people don’t answer the phone unless they know who’s calling. Even worse, illegal spoofing allows bad actors to pose as a business or customer with the intent to gain sensitive information.\n\nFortunately, call authentication is in place with the STIR/SHAKEN framework to protect both customers and contact centers.\n\nWhat Is Call Authentication?\n\nCall authentication is a process that verifies the identity of a caller and makes illegal spoofing more difficult. As denoted in the STIR/SHAKEN framework, a certificate of authenticity needs to be attached to every call so that service providers can differentiate legitimate calls from fraudulent calls like illegal spoofing, robocalls, or spam calls. If the call doesn’t match the certificate, then the customer will see a “spam risk” warning on the caller ID.\n\nHow Does Call Authentication Work?\n\nOnce your contact center makes a call, your service provider receives a request to place that call. From there, the provider verifies the source of the call and assigns it an attestation level. Next, the provider creates a SIP Identity header that confirms the information from the number that placed the call. Then when the service provider of the customer you’re calling receives the call, they verify the identity of the header and certificate. Based on this information, the destination provider determines how the call will be displayed (or even blocked).\n\nAttestation levels play an important role in deciding how a call will be displayed on a customer’s phone.\n\nFull (A-level) attestation means that the provider can confirm that the caller is authorized to use the number and that no spoofing has occurred.\n\nPartial (B-level) attestation means that the provider has authenticated the origin of the call but can’t verify if the caller is authorized to use the number.\n\nGateway (C-level) attestation means that the provider has authenticated the location of the call but can’t authenticate the call source.\n\nCalls with A-level attestation are seen as the most trustworthy and least likely to be spam. The display will look different on every customer’s phone, but carriers will try to make it apparent that A-level calls can be trusted.\n\nIf you want to display your business name on your caller ID and have complete control over how your call is displayed, Hiya Connect can help. Our Branded Call feature allows you to display your company name, logo, reason for calling, and more.\n\nCall Center Authentication Best Practices\n\nUnder the STIR/SHAKEN framework, there are a few best practices that your contact center should follow to get a high attestation level.\n\nUse a reputable service provider\n\nRegister the phone numbers you call from\n\nAvoid using least call routing\n\nMonitor the reputation of your numbers\n\nTo check if any of your numbers are displaying spam warning labels, contact us for a reputation analysis.\n\nProtect Your Contact Center from Spoofing\n\nIf a bad actor knows your business number and can find the numbers of your customers, then the groundwork is laid for a scam. By spoofing your number, a scammer can pose as your business and ask customers for sensitive information. If a customer falls for the scam, it can damage the trust that the public has in your organization."

Making calls is less convenient. If a legit number gets flagged by enough people, like my union outreach, there's nothing you can do to fix it. Likewise with any number that's been assigned the wrong ID, unless you want to add it to your contacts (and sometimes even then you can't fix it). After a few months of use, all new caller info gets hidden behind premium. Also, phone number links from the web or elsewhere get lost when tapped to call. Have to go back and copy again.",

Also Serves as a makeshift caller ID where there wasn’t one available beforehand on legitimate business numbers from in and out of State. Works best as long as you KEEP APP OPEN and REFRESH THE DATABASE. Also, submit info on the spam numbers you as a user encounter, which I assume is how the “database” stays current. We are the keepers and informed participants of the content. We are the victims and must report the wrongdoings. Else the numbers won’t be known to this system. Cons- This app has a hard time catching spam calls with local area code prefix. After listening to a recent episode of the “Reply All” podcast on the subject: Why spam calls on cellphones appear as local numbers even if the local area where you travel changes? It is because these numbers are very appealing to intended victims and therefore appealing for spam software. You, The intended recipient is much more likely to answer a local call than one out of state, just the act of answering means the spam bot now knows your number is an active phone, you will see an increase in calls from local spam numbers. Happy Birthday Frankenstein! The thing you should do? Don’t decline them, don’t answer them.

If a legit number gets flagged by enough people, like my union outreach, there's nothing you can do to fix it. Likewise with any number that's been assigned the wrong ID, unless you want to add it to your contacts (and sometimes even then you can't fix it). After a few months of use, all new caller info gets hidden behind premium. Also, phone number links from the web or elsewhere get lost when tapped to call. Have to go back and copy again.",

Also Serves as a makeshift caller ID where there wasn’t one available beforehand on legitimate business numbers from in and out of State. Works best as long as you KEEP APP OPEN and REFRESH THE DATABASE. Also, submit info on the spam numbers you as a user encounter, which I assume is how the “database” stays current. We are the keepers and informed participants of the content. We are the victims and must report the wrongdoings. Else the numbers won’t be known to this system. Cons- This app has a hard time catching spam calls with local area code prefix. After listening to a recent episode of the “Reply All” podcast on the subject: Why spam calls on cellphones appear as local numbers even if the local area where you travel changes? It is because these numbers are very appealing to intended victims and therefore appealing for spam software. You, The intended recipient is much more likely to answer a local call than one out of state, just the act of answering means the spam bot now knows your number is an active phone, you will see an increase in calls from local spam numbers. Happy Birthday Frankenstein! The thing you should do? Don’t decline them, don’t answer them.

I wouldn't  have known if I hadn't gone into \"blocked calls\" on my S23 Ultra to have  a look after receiving a text notif informing me that attempts made to  reach my by my postal service had failed multiple times today.\n\nI  was hoping - like \"Spam Protection\" on my secondary Pixel device (which  was more efficient) - Samsung's spam call service would at least let it  ring with a \"Suspected Spam\" floating message then give me the option  to answer, reject or block instead of autoblocking. As far as memory  services, this is the first time I'm receiving a call from my postal  service so I hadn't done any prior settings to block it to begin with.\n\nI  don't know how it determines what is spam and what isn't. But it would  be scary to think one day somebody might be in a situation where an  emergency scenario at home occurred and Hiya autoblocks all incoming calls from a family member without the user's knowledge.\n\n## Comment ID k4jlbf5 with +4 score by [(I2iSTUDIOS, Reddit, 2023-10-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1763egw/experience_with_hiya_spam_call_protection/k4jlbf5/) (in reply to ID 1763egw):\nChange the settings to what you desire.

They are a glass repair company. Sometimes they have to ring a customer back to schedule a job or quote/confirm things etc. \n\nRecently it seems Hiya (suspected as it seems to be mainly Samsung phones) has blanket marking nearly all my customer's calls as SPAM. Meaning that THEIR clients don't answer their phones and miss appointments or thinks no-one ever calls them back etc, when instead the calls have silently dropped into their spam basket.\n\nThen I found this article:\n\n[https://commsrisk.com/big-us-call-analytics-firms-hiya-and-tns-blasted-for-conflict-of-interest-over-incorrect-spam-labels/](https://commsrisk.com/big-us-call-analytics-firms-hiya-and-tns-blasted-for-conflict-of-interest-over-incorrect-spam-labels/)\n\nHiya were very proud to announce their use of AI here to classify numbers as spam or not: \n\n[https://www.geekwire.com/2021/spam-smackdown-hiya-claims-massive-step-forward-using-ai-against-illegal-phone-calls/](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/spam-smackdown-hiya-claims-massive-step-forward-using-ai-against-illegal-phone-calls/)\n\nSeems Hiya and services like it may be making a big mess, (or doing it on purpose?) then getting businesses to contact them to clear the numbers from being marked as spam. I'm not sure whether they charge to clear legit number from their database but they have paid tiers so maybe it's just to get a point of contact to the business to try to convince them to buy their product. I won't speculate but it seems possible.\n\nIn any case thanks to the tardy way these services operate (and there's a few of them I'm just suspecting Hiya as it seems to be happening mostly on Samsung phones (that use Hiya)), I have a customer losing their customers and costing them money hand over fist.\n\nI believe services such as this CAN be beneficial for sure but when they get to choose who receives phone calls from whom based on AI without any confirmation about the numbers in question it's like holding numbers to hostage?\n\nIn any case. Big headaches for me and my clients and I hope some authority steps in soon to streamline the system and prevent legit numbers from getting blocked as it can literally ruin a business!\n\n### Comment ID l1kxjs1 with +1 score by [(Fresh_computer_smell, Reddit, 2024-04-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1763egw/experience_with_hiya_spam_call_protection/l1kxjs1/) (in reply to ID kubcwsz):\nThis is a great article.

For me writing is writing - it all starts with a main theme,  then i´ll find an different way to approach it. Like for example  \"Pocket full of Drops\" (with Telekinesis) - the whole theme of that is using the metaphor of dealing out music & dubs like \"slinging dope\".  \n\n\"If you´re a bass (free-base rock/crack) fiend, we got the D (Diesel - old-school slang for heroin but also power fuel) we supplying it\" \n\n- i just enjoy writing and just literally having fun with it and creating imagery which goes with the feel of the music is what i consider the real art of it. I like to reference things that i like and inject my personality into the lyrics. Different style of dnb obviously bring out different sides of me.\n\nIn my other music or my dnb personal projects i´m more involved with the production process as far as the composition, topline melodies and arrangements of the ideas (mainly with my music partner Tommy) before they get the producer, but for dnb as far as external collabs go - most of the time i receive already full solid track ideas - so there's no need for it. I bring the vocal sauce to the pot :)\n\n## Comment ID lerg6p6 with +8 score by [(coppaworld174, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/lerg6p6/) (in reply to ID 1eb34l9):\nSo!

My question is: are those some teasers of something that may happen in the future or are those just some freestyles that you are not going to release? I've always found interesting your style, cause to me it's like you are doing hip hop on a drum and bass beat, that's why i also think your tracks are so likeable and easy to connect with.\n\n### Comment ID leqtvir with +5 score by [(coppaworld174, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/leqtvir/) (in reply to ID lepsv59):\nHeya!

I've tried writing something and actually also recorded a bit in a small studio, but it's so hard to write original lyrics (I know that might be obvious but I never really experienced it myself haha).

Some are good and sparing with their words, some are incessant and to be honest, shit. I recently left Brixton Bass just after midnight because of them. \n\nI’ve just got tickets to drum and bass classics in late August and they’ve got a separate arena with no MC’s at all “let the music speak for itself” is the tag line. \n\nI go back to a time before MC’s, so what do you think can be done for those who simply aren’t too keen on them, because sometimes it’s impossible to get away from them.\n\n### Comment ID ler781a with +5 score by [(coppaworld174, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/ler781a/) (in reply to ID leq4s3h):\nHey mate, well.... i FEEL you so much on this point. As an MC myself its really quite difficult because i totally understand what you talking about. Its not like i have ears immune to this kind of thing myself, its just a shame that it reflects bad on the actual artform as a whole and those of us who take it seriously. Obviously i wasnt there or can comment on your recent experience but it seems like its not an uncommon one.\n\nObviously your never going to please EVERY member of a crowd as an MC but i do feel that if you are holding the microphone you should have enough self-awareness to understand when you are getting in the way or stopping people from enjoying the music. For me personally, i am there because i enjoy the music aswell and therefore i want to hear the music and enjoy the music with everyone else there, thats the whole point no? I know what my voice sounds like and as much as i enjoy hearing it, thats not the focus of why i´m there. I can chat in the shower to myself all day if i wanted lol but the thing is... and this might give you a little insight, is sometimes hearing yourself and holding the microphone can be a kind of a \"power trip\" for people, its sad to say but its kinda true... but with great power, comes great responsibility - but that part is not read in the handbook for mc-ing.\n\nAlso its alot easier to pass as an \"MC\" then it is as DJ because the audible clanging would stop the party instantly but vocal clanging seems to be more tolerated but at the expense of the ravers/punters. I think its not an MC-issue per say but a promoter issue for letting people on the microphone who might not have the professionalism, composure and experience yet to step up to that responsibility. And in the end, the ravers/punters lose out and also the MC´s who work  really hard and respect the craft also because it perpetuates MC-Bashing culture and turns regular people into people that \"dont like MCs\"\n\nI feel ya mate, and only wish there was a license for this - that you had to apply for to pass the MC-Test.  I think selecting nights with certain MCs who are in control of the microphone or picking nights that dont have MC´s or MC free-rooms is the easiest solution in the time being.\n\n#### Comment ID lericwo with +2 score by [(blimeyitsme, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/lericwo/) (in reply to ID ler781a):\nHey Marvin \n\nThanks for a great, lengthy and very well considered reply, I really appreciate it. \n\nI’ve not heard you at a club (yet) but just reading your understanding from my point of view (and of course your own experience), I reckon you’d be an MC I’d enjoy. \n\nIt may not have sounded like it, but I do actually enjoy some and I didn’t mean to shit on your talent at all.

ChiaoGoo are my favorites hands down. They have sharp points that I like for lace. I haven't had too much trouble with the joins or with yarn catching. I did have one cable come out but I think it was my fault. It was a hot day and I tugged on them when the needle was stuck under something. (I tend to have a project in my car at all times so the heat got to it.) HiyaHiya are nice as well. Some people have had problems with the case because the needles aren't super secure. The join is nice but my yarn catches on part of the cable near the join. There is a little bump there on some of them. KnitPicks are affordable and pretty decent. They were my first set. I still use them frequently. The join comes undone if you don't use the key to tighten it. Don't think I have had too much trouble with them. The points are the dullest out of the three sets.

I have opinions but these are just my preferences. \n\nI have heard that Knit Picks doesn't have all that great quality, but I haven't bought many needles from there. I guess they recently moved production/sourcing and it screwed some stuff up? Anyway, that's 3rd hand info for you. \n\nMy personal favorites are HiyaHiyas, followed by chiaogoo, followed by addi. And here's why:\n\n**addi** \n\n* well known for their brass needles, which smell funny to some people and have a more \"sticky\" feel than other metals\n* most flexible cords, which annoys me because the cord is EVERYWHERE OMG\n* most expensive (last I checked)\n* I have heard the joins on the interchangeables are excellent but I haven't used them myself\n* moderate sharpness\n\n**HiyaHiya**\n\n* HiyaHiya sharps are the sharpest - sharper than addi lace or chiaogoo lace (I think there is one brand that has sharper needles but I can't remember what it is)\n* Buying both sets is more expensive, but you get a wider range of sizes (US2-15 vs ... US4-10.5? I think?) \n* You can pick one or the other. Personally I use smaller yarn weights more so I got US2-8. \n* moderate flexibility cords\n* joins are good. I do have to rescrew mine relatively often\n* the smoothest needles ever (I think they're hallow stainless steel)\n\n**Chaiogoo**\n\n* I think these are brushed stainless? So they're heavier and more textured than the HiyaHiyas\n* the cord is designed to prevent kinking (yeah, I've kinked one though) so it's pretty stiff. Good for some things, not so good for magic loop\n* pretty sharp, close second to the HiyaHiyas\n* Can't speak to joins because I haven't used the interchangeables\n* I think these are the cheapest of the 3\n\nIf you haven't tried these, I highly encourage you to try the ones you are thinking of. I think needle choice is such a personal preference and you really won't know until you try. :)\n\n### Comment ID cx7iug7 with +2 score by [(BinChicken, Reddit, 2015-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx7iug7/) (in reply to ID cx79fhi):\nJust to expand on your point, I got the small set of hiya hiyas, and the larger sizes I picked up in the knitpicks metal needles.\r\rThis is because I find bulky yarn does not have as much trouble getting past things like joins.\n\n### Comment ID cx863j3 with +2 score by [(Celt42, Reddit, 2015-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx863j3/) (in reply to ID cx79fhi):\nLove the break down, thanks!\n\n## Comment ID cx792c9 with +3 score by [(arcticfawx, Reddit, 2015-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx792c9/) (in reply to ID 3tl1e8):\nI've never tried Hiya Hiya, but I have knitpicks and ChiaoGoo small set. Waiting a while to get the large set as well. I like the ChiaoGoos a LOT more than my knitpicks set. They're buttery smooth to knit with, nothing falls apart, the cables are so flexible they're awesome for magic looping. My knitpicks were constantly coming apart, the needles fell out of their sockets, the joins were snaggy, they needles unscrewed from the cables in the middle of projects and the cables were stiff as a rod with tons of memory. It was nearly impossible to do magic loop on my knitpicks without giant ladders because the stiffness in the cables kept wanting to push everything apart. I never use my knitpicks set anymore since getting the Chiaogoos, except on the rare occasion I need needle sizes larger than 5mm, since I don't have the large Chiaogoo set yet. I kinda wanna get rid of them completely but haven't gotten around to selling them yet. \n\nOn the other hand, knitpicks customer service is excellent, and they'll replace anything if you call them about it. But at this point about 70% of the needle tips I've gotten from them have been replaced or glued back together. It's not worth the effort. Though that's only the wood tips. The metal ones are fine, but issues with the cables and joins still apply.\n\n## Comment ID cx75ga2 with +2 score by [(emma1961, Reddit, 2015-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx75ga2/) (in reply to ID 3tl1e8):\nI have complete sets of both Hiya Hiya and ChiaoGoo. Both with 5\" needles.\n\nThe needles are pretty similar with the Hiya Hiya being a bit pointier.\n\nThe joins on both are secure and I don't have a preference of one over the other. \n\nNow, the cables is where things get interesting. Hands down, the TWIST Red Cables of the ChiaoGoo, beat out the Hiya Hiya cables. They're much, much more substantial and therefore lay nice and flat. The Hiya Hiya cables are very thin, like fishing line, and they are always in my way. The only thing about the Hiya Hiya cables that I like are that they swivel where the ChiaoGoo cables do not.\n\nThat being said, if I had only used the Hiya Hiya set I would have been perfectly happy with them. But since I have two sets to choose from, I keep reaching for the ChiaoGoo.\n\n## Comment ID cx760bo with +2 score by [(kauni, Reddit, 2015-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx760bo/) (in reply to ID 3tl1e8):\nI have the addis because the only way for the screw in interchangeables to stay together for me is loctite or super glue.

I was originally going to get the Chia goo bamboo interchangeables but it seemed like hiya hiya was about the same qualify for less. Totally no regrets, they also have metal interchangeables if you prefer I generally prefer the bamboo but it depends on the fibers and types of projects you do more often. Addis are great but very pricey and only metal I do love their sock rockets tough. Knit picks is pretty low quality and every circular needle I have gotten from them has broken within 6 months and they wouldn't replace it for me. I would also recommend purchasing from jbw Bc they will replace or exchange broken needles pretty much lifetime. \n\nThe joins on the hiya hiya interchangeables are very smooth but do occasionally start to unscrew if working for a while but it's very easy to fix without taking off your project.\n\n### Comment ID cx860l5 with +1 score by [(Celt42, Reddit, 2015-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx860l5/) (in reply to ID cx7t54c):\nI'm discovering I'm not a fan of the wooden needles.

Unfortunately, HIYA vs SHMA has become quite the toxic fan boy wars that it's hard to have honest critical discussion.  \n\nI own multiple figures across both lines (and many other lines). In my opinion - SHMA utilizes superior feeling plastics and joint engineering (broadly speaking, exceptions always apply). HIYA figures feel heavier, which some prefer, but the plastics feel cheaper and the joints can be stiff. \n\nWhen the QC is perfect - SHMA offers better paint app. Key word is WHEN QC is perfect and it's very often not. HIYA QC on paint is more even across all releases and reliable. With SHMA, it can be a gamble. \n\nWhen it comes to the Monsterverse - HIYA is the clear winner. The SHMA MV figures (again with some exception) have been some of the worst QC offenders. \n\nBut then you have SHMA releases like Godzilla 1972, Space Godzilla, Godzilla 1954 70th Anniversary Ver - these are S Tier figures and blow out any HIYA.  \n\nSo SHMA is a bit of roller coaster while HIYA is very consistent. \n\nUltimately price is the biggest factor most will point too - You can often get 2 HIYAs for slightly less than 1 SHMA - that's very hard to ignore.\n\n#### Comment ID m0hc6da with +1 score by [(FalconFreak10, Reddit, 2024-12-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GODZILLA/comments/1h69wf8/hiya_toys_godzilla_2002/m0hc6da/) (in reply to ID m0h4acz):\nThanks for the in-depth reply, I'll definitely grab a Hiya figure now.

For as good as the sculpt gets, the paint is often spotty.

They just need to make one that's pink/red.\n\nThat's how it was with the Minus One figure.

Cause like the head doesn't stay looking down when it jumps up into flight mode; it goes horizontal.\n\nAlso, swappable wings I guess? A pair open and a pair closed?\n\nAnd on top of all that, the wing span would be smaller than Mothra's with a very similar body size. How do you justify bringing it to $50? Maybe a MUTO cocoon to go alongside it??\n\n#### Comment ID m0teazr with +1 score by [(HiveOverlord2008, Reddit, 2024-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SHMonsterArts/comments/1h83b30/hiya_toys_godzilla_2014_pics/m0teazr/) (in reply to ID m0te5du):\nThe head problem can already be solved since they gave their Mechagodzilla 1993 figure the ability to move his head upward. They just need to figure out how to not make it look weird since HokMUTO has a very weird skull.\n\nHokMUTO dwarfs Mothra in all but wingspan, he was 60 meters tall. He’d be decently large.\n\nAnd the MUTO cocoon makes sense as an accessory, yes.\n\n## Comment ID m0py3fr with +4 score by [(RodBoi10, Reddit, 2024-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SHMonsterArts/comments/1h83b30/hiya_toys_godzilla_2014_pics/m0py3fr/) (in reply to ID 1h83b30):\nThis has got to be the most accurate 2014 figure I've seen yet, absolute perfection! ✋😤👌🔥💯\n\n## Comment ID m0ptjta with +2 score by [(TheOfficial_BossNass, Reddit, 2024-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SHMonsterArts/comments/1h83b30/hiya_toys_godzilla_2014_pics/m0ptjta/) (in reply to ID 1h83b30):\nVery nice\n\n## Comment ID m0qq5jc with +2 score by [(JurASSic_Fan0405, Reddit, 2024-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SHMonsterArts/comments/1h83b30/hiya_toys_godzilla_2014_pics/m0qq5jc/) (in reply to ID 1h83b30):\nWell what do you, they gave him the updated sculpt!

Each of the last, generally three, calls keep sending day after day. They have exactly the same received date. As a result, I have no idea when the call/vm was received. For voicemail messages I have to use Transcript to get Hiya’s interpretation of voicemails. \n\nLast week, I submitted a request for help with numerous app issues and received a fill-in-the-blank reply that there is no guarantee that they will respond personally. What??? There is NO telephone support. So…too bad customers in need of support. I canceled my subscription because this app bites.

Also Serves as a makeshift caller ID where there wasn’t one available beforehand on legitimate business numbers from in and out of State. Works best as long as you KEEP APP OPEN and REFRESH THE DATABASE. Also, submit info on the spam numbers you as a user encounter, which I assume is how the “database” stays current. We are the keepers and informed participants of the content. We are the victims and must report the wrongdoings. Else the numbers won’t be known to this system. Cons- This app has a hard time catching spam calls with local area code prefix. After listening to a recent episode of the “Reply All” podcast on the subject: Why spam calls on cellphones appear as local numbers even if the local area where you travel changes? It is because these numbers are very appealing to intended victims and therefore appealing for spam software. You, The intended recipient is much more likely to answer a local call than one out of state, just the act of answering means the spam bot now knows your number is an active phone, you will see an increase in calls from local spam numbers. Happy Birthday Frankenstein! The thing you should do? Don’t decline them, don’t answer them. But do Report them through this Hiya app for now and hope that spam call scientists find a way to neutralize this curse to our existence before we end up eating ourselves out of the trap to break free into a new more nub-centric experience.",

      "# [USANA Health Sciences Announces Strategic Acquisition of Hiya Health on 2024-12-23](https://ir.usana.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/769/usana-health-sciences-announces-strategic-acquisition-of)\nHiya is a fast-growing, emerging leader of high-quality children’s health & wellness products.\n\nBroadens USANA’s reach into the highly attractive direct-to-consumer channel driven by Hiya’s powerful subscription model with runway for sustainable future growth.\n\nExpected to be immediately accretive to 2025 adjusted EBITDA.\n\n9/30/2024 LTM net sales of $103 million, LTM net income of $19 million, and LTM adjusted EBITDA of $22 million.\n\nThe Company will discuss the transaction during a conference call on Monday, December 23, 2024, at 5:00 PM ET.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- USANA Health Sciences, Inc. (NYSE: USNA) (the “Company,” “USANA”), today announced its acquisition of a 78.8% controlling ownership stake in Hiya Health Products, LLC (“Hiya”), a leading direct-to-consumer provider of high-quality children’s health & wellness products. The $205 million cash transaction closed on December 23, 2024 and is anticipated to be accretive to USANA’s 2025 adjusted EBITDA. For the last twelve months ended September 30, 2024 (unaudited), Hiya generated net sales of $103 million, net income of $19 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $22 million. As of September 30, 2024, Hiya had more than 200,000 customers.\n\n“The Hiya brand is a natural fit for USANA and this acquisition represents a key strategic milestone for our business,” said Jim Brown, President and Chief Executive Officer of USANA Health Sciences, Inc. “Hiya’s co-founders, Darren Litt and Adam Gillman, have disrupted the children’s health and wellness market by building a high quality, better-for-you brand that aligns with our vision of creating the healthiest family on Earth. This strategic acquisition adds a diversified layer of growth to USANA’s overall business, while maintaining our commitment to our core direct sales business, where we continue to invest in initiatives to drive growth. Notably, this acquisition will allow USANA to reach a broader audience by diversifying distribution channels through Hiya, which we believe will enhance our ability to generate sustainable long-term growth and deliver value for our stakeholders. Darren and Adam will continue to lead Hiya through its next phase of growth. Their leadership and expertise is instrumental to Hiya’s business, which is now part of USANA’s mission and strategic objectives.”\n\nDarren Litt, co-founder and CEO of Hiya, commented, “Today represents an exciting chapter for Hiya and we are thrilled to join the USANA family. As parents ourselves, we recognized that so many wellness companies did not prioritize our children’s health interests, so we created Hiya to give families the very best in clean, honest nutrition. With the help of USANA's extensive capabilities, support and international expertise, we can now extend that commitment to create healthy products for more families in more countries. USANA and Hiya share a deep commitment to improving the lives of families everywhere by providing the best nutritional products possible, and we look forward to continuing this exciting journey as part of USANA.”\n\nStrategic Rationale\n\nFast-Growing, Emerging Leader in the Children’s Health and Wellness Market. The acquisition of Hiya provides the opportunity for USANA to expand its presence in the children’s health & wellness market through Hiya. For the last twelve months ended September 30, 2024, Hiya’s net sales of $103 million grew 50% as compared to fiscal year 2023. For fiscal year 2025, the Company currently anticipates Hiya’s net sales growth to approach 30% year-over-year.\n\nStrengthens USANA’s Financial Profile. Hiya offers a compelling subscription model with attractive margins, profitability, and cash flow generation, which is expected to enhance the Company’s ability to deliver long-term growth and drive shareholder value. Hiya’s domestic profitability diversifies USANA’s geographic sales mix and is anticipated to lower the Company’s consolidated effective tax rate and create a more tax-efficient structure.\n\nPresents Opportunity to Accelerate Growth and Enhance Profitability by Leveraging Synergies. Over the next several years, USANA and Hiya will work together to take advantage of identified synergies, assets and expertise across both companies to create efficiencies, and to accelerate growth and profitability. For example, there are opportunities for Hiya to leverage USANA’s significant manufacturing and international expansion expertise. Similarly, USANA may leverage Hiya’s market data insights, marketing expertise, and children-focused products within its direct sales channel.\n\nChannel Expansion into Direct-to-Consumer Wellness Market with a Leading and Proven Brand. Hiya currently holds a leading position in children’s Vitamins, Minerals & Supplements brand sales in the United Statesⁱ and has a clear pathway and strong growth strategy to become the #1 children’s wellness platform through new product introductions, channel expansion, and geographic expansion. Hiya’s commitment to being the most trusted and preferred brand for wellness products in the 0-18 age range is an additive category for the Company and is complimentary to USANA’s vision of the healthiest family on Earth.\n\nExpands the Company’s United States Operations. The transaction meaningfully expands and diversifies the Company’s revenue mix as Hiya’s net sales are generated in the United States through their direct-to-consumer subscription model, with plans to enter other sales channels. This will allow USANA to reach a broader audience of health-conscious consumers to grow the enterprise’s overall customer base.\n\nⁱ Source: Nielsen\n\nTransaction Highlights\n\nThe Company made an initial cash investment of approximately $205 million (subject to customary closing and post-closing purchase price adjustments) in exchange for a 78.8% ownership stake in Hiya.\n\nTransaction structure includes a put/call feature that provides for USANA’s acquisition of the remaining rollover equity at a pre-negotiated valuation scale, which is based on Hiya’s financial performance.\n\nThe transaction was financed with $200 million cash on hand with the balance covered by the Company’s existing credit facility.\n\nBofA Securities acted as exclusive financial advisor to the Company in connection with the transaction. Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C. served as the Company’s legal advisor. William Hood & Company, LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor to Hiya. Bodman PLC acted as Hiya’s legal advisor.\n\nConference Call\n\nThe Company will provide a supplemental presentation and discuss the transaction on a conference call on Monday, December 23, 2024 at 5:00 PM Eastern Time. The supplemental presentation and live audio webcast of the conference call will be available on the Company’s investor relations website at http://ir.usana.com.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release contains the non-GAAP financial measure LTM adjusted EBITDA of Hiya. Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP financial measure of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization that also excludes certain adjustments as indicated below in the reconciliation from net income.\n\nThe Company prepares its financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and investors should not directly compare with or infer relationship from any of the Company’s operating results presented in accordance with GAAP to the LTM adjusted EBITDA of Hiya. We believe that this non-GAAP financial information of Hiya may be helpful to investors as an indication of future cash flow generation. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of non-GAAP financial information as a tool for comparison. As a result, the non-GAAP financial information of Hiya is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income, presented and reported in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA:\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nLast Twelve Months Ended ($000's)\n\n30-Sep-24\n\nNet income\n\n$\n\n19,416\n\nDefinitional Adjustments:\n\nInterest expense\n\n143\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n38\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n80\n\nEBITDA before Adjustments\n\n19,677\n\nAdjustments to EBITDA:\n\nTransaction expenses and other non-recurring items\n\n760\n\nNon-operational costs\n\n566\n\nNormalizations\n\n321\n\nTiming adjustments\n\n212\n\nManagement compensation\n\n142\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\n$\n\n21,678\n\nAbout USANA\n\nUSANA develops and manufactures high-quality nutritional supplements, functional foods and personal care products that are sold directly to Associates and Preferred Customers throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, the Philippines, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Thailand, France, Belgium, Colombia, Indonesia, Germany, Spain, Romania, Italy, and India.

      "# [How to detect and defend against deepfake voice scams by Shaun Kehrberg](https://blog.hiya.com/how-to-detect-and-defend-against-audio-deepfakes)\nPhone scams have been around since practically the invention of the landline. But there’s a dangerous new element making scam calls even more convincing: the use of deepfake voice technology.\n\nA deepfake can be any type of media — audio, video, image— that has been digitally manipulated, typically for the purpose of misleading people or changing the original meaning. A voice deepfake, sometimes known as AI voice cloning, uses artificial intelligence to construct spoken sentences that sound like people saying something they did not actually say. This voice track can even be placed underneath real video footage, making it appear as if a person has endorsed or carries an opinion contrary to their own. The coupling of real video and false audio can make these deepfakes more challenging to detect and flag.\n\nDeepfake voice scams aren’t new, but AI is making them more real and easier to create. In the past, deepfakes required a significant amount of time and technical expertise. Today, there are more than a dozen AI voice cloning tools freely available on the internet. These tools require only a basic level of expertise to use.\n\nRELATED: See how our Chief Product Officer Faked the Voice of Hiya's CEO\n\nExamples of deepfake voice scams\n\nFamily emergency scams – Family emergency scams, sometimes called loved-ones scams or grandparent scams, involve a fraudster pretending to be a family member who is experiencing an emergency and in need of immediate financial help. In the past, fraudsters might simply imitate a sobbing child or grandchild, but now scammers can use AI voice cloning that makes the ruse ever more convincing.\n\nEmployee impersonations – Employee impersonations using deepfake voice technology are also becoming more common. News reports tell of an employee paying out $25 million after being fooled by a deepfake video call impersonating the company’s CFO, and a hacker deepfaking an employee’s voice to gain access to the company’s computer systems.\n\nPolitical deepfakes – One of the most prominent deepfake voice scams occurred earlier this year, as the U.S. presidential election season was just getting underway. In the Democratic primary in New Hampshire, a deepfake voice clone of President Joe Biden was used in a robocall to voters urging them to skip primary voting and instead save their vote for the general election.\n\nCompanies are beginning to take notice of this trend. In a survey conducted by the identity verification firm Regula, 37% of worldwide organizations have experienced voice deepfake identity fraud, and 82% or organizations think that voice deepfakes will be a growing threat in the next two years.\n\nDeepfake voice detection by humans is unreliable\n\nAccording to a 2023 study conducted by researchers from the Department of Security and Crime Science at University College London in the UK, humans cannot reliably detect speech deepfakes. In an experiment conducted with more than 500 participants, individuals listened to real and fake audio clips and attempted to differentiate between them. The result: listeners could only correctly identify voice deepfakes 73% of the time.\n\nThe study concluded, “As speech synthesis algorithms improve and become more realistic, we can expect the detection task to become harder. The difficulty of detecting speech deepfakes confirms their potential for misuse and signals that defenses against this threat are needed.”\n\nGovernmental regulations seek to rein in deepfakes\n\nThe battle against deepfakes and AI voice scams needs to be fought on multiple fronts. Governments play a role too. In August, the European Union’s AI Act was enacted. It’s the world’s first major law regulating the use of AI, and it governs the way companies develop, use and apply AI.\n\nAccording to NBC News, “The legislation applies a risk-based approach to regulating AI, which means that different applications of the technology are regulated differently depending on the level of risk they pose to society.” Examples of high-risk AI systems include autonomous vehicles, medical devices, loan decisioning systems, educational scoring, and remote biometric identification systems.\n\nThe United States is also drafting laws to protect against impersonations and deepfakes. Earlier this year, the US Federal Trade Commission sought public comment on a proposal that would prohibit the impersonation of individuals, which would extend protections of a new rule on government and business impersonation.\n\nAccording to the FTC, “The agency is taking this action in light of surging complaints around impersonation fraud, as well as public outcry about the harms caused to consumers and to impersonated individuals. Emerging technology — including AI-generated deepfakes — threatens to turbocharge this scourge, and the FTC is committed to using all of its tools to detect, deter, and halt impersonation fraud.”\n\nEven US states are passing legislation to combat deepfakes. Recently, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 2839 (AB 2839). The law aims to address the rise of AI-generated disinformation ahead of 2024 elections, stating that AB 2839 is crucial for protecting the integrity of elections and restoring voter trust.\n\nHow to defend against deepfake voice imposters\n\nAlthough scams carried out using deepfake speech synthesis pose a danger for both individuals and business, not all is lost. Fortunately, there is a way to identify deepfakes. While fraudsters are using AI for sinister purposes, the same technology can also be used for good.\n\nEarlier this month, Hiya acquired Locus.ai, the industry leader in deepfake detection solutions. The combination of Loccus.ai’s voice intelligence technology and the Hiya’s Adaptive AI fraud prevention system, provides businesses and carriers with the most complete fraud call protection available across the industry today. This versatile solution supports multiple languages, formats, and platforms, including video recordings and live calls across all devices.\n\nLoccus.ai’s deepfake voice detection technology is now available as Hiya AI Voice Detection. Businesses and carriers can immediately integrate AI voice detection into their own services and applications to enhance consumer trust and security. With Hiya, it’s never been easier to identify deepfake audio in personal communications apps, news and social media content, video conferencing contact center platforms, and more.",

      "# [Medicare Scams Lead Spam Calls in Q3: Hiya Report by Carl Weinschenk, Phil Britt on 2024-12-09](https://www.telecompetitor.com/medicare-scams-lead-spam-call-increases-in-q3-hiya-report/)\nA new report from voice intelligence provider Hiya says that it flagged more than 105 million suspected spam calls every day — a total of more than 9.7 billion — during the third quarter of the year.\n\nThe company said the most common global threat is from calls posing as being from banks or credit card companies. According to the report, the second most common exploit is spam calls purporting to be from Amazon. The calls generally say that there is a problem with a card linked to the target’s account or are attempts to gain personal information in the guise of completing an order or to facilitate delivery.\n\n“Quarter-on-quarter, our data shows fraud call rates continue to rise, Hiya president Kush Parikh said in a press release about the report. “Despite growing awareness of the risks, fraudsters are becoming more sophisticated, fueled in part by the latest technology to adapt their tactics. Examples of robocalls are plentiful, demonstrating that it is becoming easier — and less time intensive — for scammers to spam call victims in high volumes.”\n\nThe company’s Q3 2024 Global Call Threat Report found that spam call rates for people in the United States have increased from an average of 11 to 13 per month in the third quarter.\n\nMedicare scams continue to dominate and are likely to increase during its open enrollment period in the fourth quarter. Scammers’ goal in this case is to get valuable data such as Medicare numbers that can be used to falsely bill the US government.\n\nThe Hiya report also said that insurance scam calls ranked second. Fraudsters often impersonated IRS tax agents, Amazon and Google representatives and police personnel. These often are robocalls."
