      "# [Imposter Apps and How to Spot Them: Chronicles of App Store Imitators by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/imposter-apps/)\nImitation is the highest form of flattery. If that’s true, we at Hiya should be thrilled to see so many apps in the App Store claiming to be Hiya. Somehow it doesn’t quite ring true though.\n\nImposter apps are looking for one thing: money. As such, they “build” fake apps, load them onto the App Store, charge money for them and then sit back and reap the financial benefits until Apple shuts them down. Then, they rinse and repeat with another app.\n\nIn Hiya’s case, we now have scammers scamming an anti-scam company. Consider the gauntlet thrown.\n\nHow can you tell if an app in the app store is an imposter?\n\nDeveloper name: Hiya’s developer name is Hiya. Simple! It should be recognizable or a name that you can easily look up and verify. Note: the developer name will not always match the app name (for example, Hiya also owns the Mr. Number app), but, with a little research, you should be able to confirm if the developer is indeed legitimate.\n\nWebsite: In the app store, we link toHiya’s Web Site and ourHiya Caller ID and Block Support page. Imposter apps will have links as well, however, they don’t function or will lead to a page that has nothing to do with the app.\n\nCost: Did you hear from a friend that Hiya is free? They were right! If you go into the App store and all of a sudden, you have to pay for a “free” app, you’re looking at an imposter.\n\nReviews: One of the most important tools at our fingertips. As fake apps are just that – fake, they will not function as they are supposed to. After paying $1.99 for an app and it doesn’t work, you can bet reviews will come in and they will not be pleasant. Take a look at the reviews. Sure, Hiya doesn’t get 5 star reviews all the time (nobody’s perfect…not yet, at least), but, we have a wide range of positive reviews from many users. Imposters will have only a few reviews and they will not be positive.\n\nImposters will receive a few, very bad reviews",
      "# [Amazon Scam Calls to Watch For | Hiya by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/amazon-scam)\nAmazon is in an enviable position of being a top retailer and having global brand recognition. The flip side of that, however, is that its notoriety makes it a prime target for scammers. Fraudsters making random robocalls have a good chance of reaching someone who has an Amazon account.\n\nAmazon has operations on five continents and has dedicated websites in 13 countries. It’s no wonder that Amazon phone scams are common in many countries, including\n\n#1 phone scam in Canada\n\n#1 phone scam in the UK\n\n#2 phone scam in the US\n\nHow do Amazon scam calls work?\n\nNo matter how hard you try to keep your phone number private, scammers have several tactics to obtain contact information. There are data brokers that find personal information online and sell it to third parties. Scammers can purchase this information and then contact you about your Amazon account. Scammers can also obtain any personal information that was leaked during a data breach.\n\nOnce they have your phone number, scammers make a call from an unknown number or one that was spoofed to appear as if it were coming from Amazon. The scammer then claims to be part of the Amazon customer support team calling about an issue with an order or a notice of a security breach. The scammer then attempts to gain your personal information (like your Amazon account username and password or credit card information) by claiming that this information is necessary to resolve the issue.\n\nSamples of Amazon scam calls\n\nBelow are transcripts of actual Amazon scam calls. These are from the Hiya honeypot: a collection of Hiya-owned phone numbers used to capture the content of scam and nuisance calls. Here is the wording of the three most common Amazon scam calls observed by Hiya:\n\n“Hello. This is Amazon. This call is to authorize a payment of $999. We would like to inform you that there is an order placed for an Apple iPhone 11 Pro using your Amazon account. If you do not authorize this order press 1, or press 2 to authorize this order.\n\n“This is a confirmation call from Amazon regarding your purchase of iPhone 13 Pro Max and Apple Airpods, totaling $1499. But we have found some suspicious activities in your account while processing the payment. So in order to cancel your order, kindly press 1 to speak with the Amazon fraud department.”\n\n“Hello. Amazon Express notice. A courier delivered twice and no one has signed for it. For details, please press 1.”\n\nEach call has a common element: the robocall asks the recipient to press a number, which will connect with a phony Amazon representative. Instead of wasting time making live calls, the scammers start with a robocall, and if the recipient falls for the scam and presses a number, a live operator will attempt to get the victim to reveal their Amazon account information or credit card number.\n\nReports from Hiya users\n\nIn addition to the honeypot, Hiya also receives user reports from consumers using Hiya Protect via their carrier, device manufacturer, or the Hiya mobile app. Here’s a sampling of the Amazon scam calls users are reporting:\n\n“Multiple calls from multiple numbers to convince me to let them help with a fraudulent purchase on Amazon.”\n\n“Claims to be from Amazon. Usually, a message that wants you to call them back about an order, then they try to pump you for information.”\n\n“Claiming to be Amazon to renew a monthly fee of $99 per month. If you speak to a consultant to cancel, they request your bank details to stop the payment.”\n\nHow to protect against scam calls\n\nCarriers can add Hiya Protect, a complete call protection solution that enables carriers to protect their subscribers by blocking and labeling spam calls, and helping them identify wanted calls. Hiya Protect recently added a new layer of protection, Personal AI, which personalizes call protection to individual subscribers so they receive the calls that are important to them and are protected from targeted attacks.\n\nWith Hiya Connect, enterprises can improve customer engagement and loyalty while protecting their customers from deceitful interactions and their brand reputation from inaccurate spam labeling. Get a free Reputation Analysis report to see if your customers are at risk.\n\nIndividuals can check with their phone carrier to see if it offers any spam/scam-blocking capabilities. If not, ask your carrier to consider adding Hiya Protect.",

Without thinking, we answer the call, only to hear, “[car warranty scam beginning.]” The frustration we feel from this spam call, coupled with the frequency we experience it, leaves us with a sour taste in our mouths. It’s no wonder 87% of consumers believe unidentified calls may be fraudulent. And for call centers that regularly make outbound calls, this has detrimental effects.\n\nThat’s why branding your calls with your business name is so important. With a Branded Call, the caller ID displays a caller’s company name, location, logo, and other identifiable information before the call even starts. Instead of seeing “unknown caller” and worrying about the nuisance of a potential spam call, a Branded Call allows customers to identify and trust the source of a call immediately.\n\nLet your customers know you're calling. With branded caller ID, display your company name, logo, and location to engage with more people, faster.\n\nBenefits of enterprise branded caller ID\n\nAlthough agencies like the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are trying to use their resources to stop the exponential increase in spam calls, they’re simply aren't given enough to respond to the rapidly evolving scam tactics deployed by scammers.\n\nTrust\n\nWhen consumers cannot trust the calls coming from your business, it starts affecting their perception of your brand. Imagine you are waiting for a call from your food delivery service on the status of your order. Time goes by and you haven’t received an update. You’d be pretty frustrated and your confidence in the company would plummet. While the delivery driver could have been calling you all along, you didn’t answer the calls because you didn’t know who was calling. As more and more customers stop answering their phones for unidentified calls, this damaged reputation can snowball into massive losses as customers choose other delivery services.\n\nSecurity and spam\n\nFraudsters are always ready and willing to impersonate well-known companies—and with people more connected to their phones than ever before, telecom scams are their method of choice. But with Hiya’s Branded Call, by providing your company name and logo, you can assure your customers that your call is legitimate. Hiya also offers Secure Call, an additional feature that pre-authenticates outbound calls before they are made, securing your branded caller identity, and protecting your customers from falling victim to fraudsters using your numbers.\n\nBranding\n\nThe customer's experience of the call will influence whether they have a positive or negative perception of your business. A Branded Call will help create a visual experience that draws the customer in and increases their positive association with the business and its call center. Word of mouth is a powerful marketing vehicle, so it is important to remember that positive interactions often lead customers to spread the word.\n\nIncrease answer rates\n\nImagine you get two calls—one says “unknown number” and the other says a company’s name. Which one are you going to answer? Call centers with a branded caller ID through Hiya report an average 80% increase in answer rates. Customers pick up the phone when they know who’s calling.\n\nWhat are the risks of not having an enterprise branded caller ID?\n\nAt this point, you should be quite familiar with the fact that branded caller ID can improve the efforts of your contact center dramatically. But what are the risks associated with not having a Branded Call? Consider the following:\n\nUnanswered calls\n\nWhat do most people do when they encounter an unknown number? They ignore the call. According to Hiya's State of the Call survey, 84% of consumers think an unidentified call is fraudulent. As a result of being unable to communicate essential information to your customers, your company’s bottom line will suffer.\n\nThe challenges of unidentified calls\n\nIn today's digital age, trust is paramount. When a call comes in without a clear indicator of who is calling, many consumers hesitate to answer, fearing potential scams or unwanted solicitations. Imagine eagerly awaiting an update on your food delivery order. Minutes turn into hours, and there's no word. Your frustration mounts, and your trust in the service wanes. Unbeknownst to you, the delivery driver may have been trying to reach you, but their calls went unanswered because there was no clear indication of who was on the other end. This scenario is becoming increasingly common as more individuals opt to ignore unidentified calls. As this trend continues, businesses face the risk of eroding customer trust and loyalty, potentially leading to significant losses as customers turn to competitors with clearer communication channels.\n\nHow Hiya can help\n\nWant to know how you can brand your business name on your outbound calls? calling an iPhone or Android?

      "# [Evolution of Phones and its Affect on Society by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/telephone-transformation/)\nThe smartphones we possess today have come a long way from the first rendition of the telephone back in 1876 when Alexander Graham Bell invented and patented the first short-range phone. But like people, phones have evolved throughout history to cater to our lifestyles and needs.\n\nHere’s a look at how telephones have transformed over the years…\n\nShort-Range Phone: Despite a number of individuals from around the world who’ve contributed to the invention of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell was the first to receive a patent for his short-range phone in 1876. Testing out the phone in his Boston laboratory, he rang his assistant Thomas Watson, and become well known-for saying, “Mr. Watson, come here – I want to see you.”\n\nCandlestick Phone: The candlestick phone became popular in the 1890s through the 1930s. Separated by two pieces, it featured a mouth piece (transmitter) mounted at the top of the stand, and a receiver (ear phone) that the user would hold to their ear during a call.\n\nRotary Phone: Pushing out the candlestick phone, the rotary phone came about in the 1930s when manufacturers began to combine the mouth piece and receiver of the candlestick phones into a single unit. When dialing a rotary phone, what originally started as lugs, but evolved into holes, one would then rotate the dial to the number that they wanted and then would release the dial.\n\nTouch-Dial Phone: On November 18, 1963, the Bell System unveiled the first electronic touch-dial phone system with touch-tone dialing. It would become the worldwide standard for telecommunication signaling. Using audible tones for each of the digits on the push-button keypad, specific frequencies were designated to each row and column. The tones helped the switching center determine which key was pressed.\n\nFirst Mobile Phone: On April 3, 1973, Motorola researcher and executive, Martin Cooper, made the first mobile telephone from handheld subscriber equipment. Weighing in at 2.4 lbs and measuring at 228.6 x 127 x 44.4mm, Cooper was said to have called a rival telecommunications company and let them know he was talking to them on a mobile phone. The prototype was able to give a caller 30 minutes of talk-time and took about 10 hours to charge.\n\nCordless Phone: Cordless phones became a hot commodity in the 1980s but was originally invented by a female Jazz musician named Teri Pall in 1965. The handset cord of the telephone was replaced with a radio link. However, Teri’s invention would not hit the consumer market until a decade and a half later.\n\nFirst Portable Phone: Even though Martin Cooper invented the first mobile phone, the first portable mobile phone was the MicroTAC which was introduced in 1989 as “an innovative new “flip” design”, where the “mouthpiece” folded over the keypad, although the “mouthpiece” was actually located in the base of the phone, along with the ringer. Up until its release, most cellular phones were installed as car phones due to the inability to fit them into a jacket pocket.\n\nNokia: Through the mid-90s and into the early 2000s, Nokia mobile phones catered to consumers, with interchangeable faceplates, customizable designs, the first WAP browser, internal antenna, T9 Text messaging, and eventually an LCD screen and internet connectivity.\n\nFirst Camera Phone (Sanyo SCP-5300): Possessing the first camera phone, the U.S. finally adopted the Japanese trend in November 2002. The clunky clamshell design could capture photos at 640×480 pixels and had a basic flash, white balance control, self-timer, digital zoom, and various filters (sepia, black and white, and negative colors.)\n\nCrack-Berry (BlackBerry): Blackberry made waves with their popular RIM communication device in 2003 which possessed a phone, PDA, and e-mail system all in one hand-held phone. The term crack-berry came about when users constantly checked their e-mail and sent short messages through their device.\n\nSleek Mobile Design (Motorola Razr): First developed in 2003, the Motorola Razr hit it big when it was marketed as a fashion phone due to its sleek and thin profile. Over its four-year run, they sold over a 130 million phones and were named the best-selling clamshell phone in history.\n\nSmartphones: Dating back as far as 1997, it wasn’t until Japan became the first mobile market to popularize the smartphone in 1999. As BlackBerry, Palm, HTC, Windows Mobile, Samsung, Nokia, and Motorola made a name for themselves in the early 2000s, their smartphones had the capability to email, fax, and search the internet. As the smartphone craze escalated, cell phone manufacturers tested a number of functionalities that would help them capitalize on the new trend. From sliding, flipping, rotating, vertical, and even multiple keyboards, touchscreen smartphones made their way into the market which also introduce the stylus. However, the functionality these phones offered were still targeting more business users versus consumers.\n\nCue in iPhone 3G. The first of its kind, the original iPhone was the first touch-screen smartphone that was unveiled in June 2007. Apple’s take on the smartphone combines “multimedia functions with the same email and Web browsing features as all other smartphones previously had. It had a large color display with a capacitive digitizer, and its user interface was finally finger-friendly. And unlike phones before it, the iPhone had only one button on its face – the Home button – and three around its edges, two for volume up/down and one for power/standby.” reports the “The Evolution of the Smartphone” from PocketNow.\n\nToday, iPhone has paved the way for a number of other cell phone manufacturers to create their own version of the smartphones we love today. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg on how phones have evolved over history, but it’s apparent that as phones change, engineers will cater to the needs of consumers. What do you think the evolution of phones will come up with next?\n\nKeep on top of all the trends in Voice with Hiya's State of the Call report below.",

      "# [Get your questions about Spam answered](https://work.hiya.com/why-spam)\nCommon questions we hear:\n\nWhy is my businesses phone number showing up as spam?\n\nSpam labels are applied by carriers who want to protect you from scam and spam calls.\n\nIf the data shows that your calls are unwanted by your recipients, either through high abandon rates, blocks, or being reported as spam (among other datapoints), your calls are more likely to be delivered with a “spam likely” label. Mobile carriers are constantly monitoring additional datapoints, working to fight the ever evolving scam tactics used by spammers and scammers.\n\nHow can I check if my outbound caller id is showing as spam?\n\nUse a service like Hiya’s Cross Carrier Call Inspection to see how your calls are displayed across carriers and devices. If you are ready to check your numbers, fill out the form below and our team will reach out to get a list of numbers to perform the audit.\n\nSome businesses do use a revolving door of phone numbers, rotating through them to attempt to evade these labels, rather than understanding the call practices that led to this labeling in the first place. If you think your phone numbers are showing up as spam, a call inspection is the first step. Then Hiya can guide you through the next steps in getting your calls delivered with an identity that matches your business.\n\nHow often do people answer calls with a spam identity?\n\nIn short: they don’t. And as nuisance calls increase in frequency, the likelihood of someone answering a spam or unidentified number is plummeting.\n\nEven without a spam label, 87% of consumers think an unidentified number may be fraudulent. And if a consumer receives a call impersonating your business, 73% of consumers struggle to trust that business ever again.\n\nWhy is Hiya different?\n\nWe work with our customers to ensure that they are prepared to get the most out of their voice channel today, and far into the future.\n\nWe also work directly with the carriers to understand the future of best call practices, and ensure our customers are acting on these long term plans for getting their calls answered.

      "# [Beyond CATI: Making Real Connections with Voice by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/beyond-cati)\nComputer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) is a technology that saves time and increases response rates for companies that use telephone surveys for marketing research and other interview-based initiatives.\n\nCATI works just as the name implies – a live person uses a computer as an aid in interviews using an automated script. As the interviewer gets a response from the person on the phone, the answers are inputted into the computer to be used as data for analysis and outputs such as statistics, trends, patterns, and other market research.\n\nFor surveys and similar marketing programs, CATI works great and adds significant speed and value to data capture. For instance, when a person answers yes or no to a question, the CATI software will automatically provide the interviewer with the appropriate next question. A “yes” response may result in further questions that dig deeper, while a “no” response may initiate an action to end the survey with a thank you.\n\nThe pitfall: No real human interaction or intelligence added\n\nCATI certainly serves a purpose in market research and accelerates the collection of survey data, but it leaves little room for relationship building. Nor does it facilitate a deeper collection of insights that can only come from an interactive conversation between two live people.\n\nThe humanizing factor in voice calls allows the person initiating the call to:\n\nBuild a real connection. In a free-form conversation, the caller has the immediate opportunity to start building a relationship with the person on the receiving end.\n\n“Hear” emotion. Empathy is something that is only achievable in a free-form voice call, and the ability to hear the emotion of the person called is critical, especially if the person is an unhappy or frustrated customer.\n\nDiscover the unexpected. When there is a precise script to be followed, like in CATI software-driven calls, the caller is unable to change gears when the person being called says something unexpected. In a free-form call, the caller can respond directly and intelligently to provide better customer service.\n\nBeyond the humanizing touch, a voice call can bring, there are many other bottom-line benefits as well, such as increased sales, opportunities for upsells, improved customer loyalty, and best of all, greater revenue generation.\n\nIncreasing the opportunity for real connections\n\nWith the help of a branded call solution like Hiya Connect, callers can start building real connections immediately. Branded calling sets the stage for high-quality humanizing calls because a customer or prospect can see who is calling – and the reason for the call – even before the call is even answered. With this advantage, calls get answered more frequently, often on the first attempt, improving connection rates.\n\nThe personalization of a branded call also helps keep people on the phone longer, with more engagement and better bottom-line results.\n\nStart humanizing your calls today",

      "# [What Is a Robocall and How Do They Impact Business? by Laleh Hassibi](https://blog.hiya.com/robocalls-explained)\nUnexpected and often unplanned, random telephone calls throughout the day pull you and your employees away from vital tasks. But while these calls may be disruptive, they are often a necessary part of doing business. After all, customers, remote employees, vendors, and others need to be able to connect with you, even if that means occasionally pulling you away from other tasks.\n\nBut what about when the person on the other end isn’t a person at all?\n\nRobocalls are the worst. When you set everything aside to answer a ringing phone, only to be met with a prerecorded, robotic message, there is no upside. And on a larger scale, these calls are also harming businesses’ ability to effectively reach out and connect with consumers. To combat robocalls, as well as the scams, spam, and fraudulent practices they support, you first need to know what’s at stake.\n\nHere, we dive into the reality of robocalls — what they are, how they impact your business, and how to block robocalls once and for all.\n\nWhat is a robocall?\n\nRobocalls (sometimes referred to as automated calls) are calls that deliver a prerecorded voice message. These calls are usually initiated by predictive-dialer computer programs called autodialers. Once the incoming call is answered, the program automatically begins playing the prerecorded message.\n\nMany kinds of robocalls serve legitimate functions. Appointment reminders, emergency notifications, educational institutions reaching out about unexpected absences or school closures — in each of these cases, robocalls allow organizations to deliver important information easily, directly, and automatically.\n\nHowever, robocalls are often put to less legitimate uses.\n\nWhat happens if you answer a robocall?\n\nAnswering a robocall poses various risks to consumers, including confirming to scammers that the phone number is active and owned by a real person. This could potentially lead to more unsolicited calls or texts.\n\nEngaging with robocalls also increases the likelihood of falling victim to scams, including identity theft, financial fraud, and phishing schemes. These calls often employ sophisticated tactics to deceive individuals into divulging sensitive information, from bank details to personal data. Additionally, some robocalls may attempt to install malware or viruses on the recipient’s device, further compromising their privacy and security.\n\nAnswering robocalls can expose consumers to various threats, so it is important to exercise caution and utilize strategies like call blocking to mitigate these risks. Even if consumers answer a robocall, they can use these tips to protect themselves.\n\n1. Hang up\n\nHanging up as soon as possible is important because it immediately severs any potential interaction with the robocall. By ending the call promptly, individuals reduce their exposure to potential scams, fraud, or attempts to gather personal information.\n\n2. Avoid saying “yes”\n\nSaying \"yes\" to a bot in a robocall can have severe consequences. Scammers may record affirmative responses and misuse them to validate transactions, change account settings, or sign up for services without the victim's consent. This tactic can lead to identity theft and unauthorized charges. It can even lead to legal ramifications if the recorded \"yes\" is used to misrepresent agreement to terms or contracts.\n\n3. Don’t follow the instructions\n\nFollowing instructions on a robocall poses significant risks, and these instructions may lead to downloading malware. The instructions could also cause the consumer to provide access to sensitive information or engage in activities that compromise security or privacy. By disobeying these directives, individuals can avoid falling into traps set by scammers.\n\n4. Avoid giving personal information\n\nGiving personal information to a robocaller opens the door to identity theft, financial fraud, and other forms of exploitation. Scammers can use this information to impersonate individuals and access their financial accounts. It's crucial for individuals to never disclose sensitive information such as Social Security numbers or passwords over the phone to unknown entities.\n\n5. Report the call\n\nFinally, reporting robocalls is essential to help authorities track down and take action against scammers. Individuals can report robocalls to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United States or similar regulatory bodies in other countries. Additionally, many phone service providers offer tools or services for reporting and blocking unwanted calls. By reporting robocalls, individuals contribute to efforts to combat telephone scams.\n\nAre robocalls illegal?\n\nRobocalls haven’t gone unnoticed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC); various laws exist to protect individuals and groups from harassment from automated-dialing programs.\n\nThe FTC website says this about robocall legality:\n\n“A robocall trying to sell you something is illegal unless a company has your written permission to call you that way. To get your permission, the company has to be clear it’s asking to call you with robocalls, and it can’t make you agree to the calls to get a product or service. If you give permission, you have the right to change your mind later.”\n\nIn other words, businesses need explicit permission in order to try to sell you products through robocalls. That said, there are certain exceptions. For example, political campaigns and charities asking for donations do not legally require your permission to use robocalls, and neither do debt collection calls or calls from healthcare providers. Additionally, calls that are purely informational without requesting any payment are likewise unrestricted.\n\nCongress recently passed the TRACED, (Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence) Act, which raises the fine on spam robocalls to as much as $10,000 per illegal call. Unfortunately, even with laws on the books designed to deter robocallers, robocalls keep coming.\n\nHiya’s 2021 State of the Call research reports a total of 157.4 billion spam and fraud calls were received in North America and Europe in 2020. And, because so many of these calls consist of spam messages, scams, and illegal sales tactics, the callers have no compunction about reaching out to numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry.\n\nHow robocalls hurt business\n\nIt takes about 23 minutes to recover and refocus after a single work interruption, and employees tend to compensate for interruptions with rushed, less-accurate work. Frequent robocalls hinder productivity and may be costing your business significant amounts of money.\n\nScammers target businesses\n\nIndividuals are not the only ones who can fall victim to robocalls — fraudsters target businesses as well. Google business listing scams are a type of robocall that manipulate payments from businesses by claiming that their listings are incomplete and in danger of being taken down. Local map verification scams swindle businesses into handing over private information.\n\nCall recipients are skeptical\n\nBeyond hurting productivity or tricking businesses out of money or sensitive information, robocalls also have an extremely negative effect on how consumers respond to incoming calls. Approximately 94% of people are now hesitant to answer unidentified calls, and 26% of call recipients have trouble immediately distinguishing automated calls from real human callers. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) even cautions consumers not to answer calls from unknown numbers.\n\nConsumers are becoming increasingly distrustful of calls from unknown numbers. Legitimate businesses are getting reported as spam because the customers don’t know who is calling. To make matters worse, 56% of businesses overall don't actually know whether their calls have been flagged as fraud.\n\nFraudulent calls may be drowning out your ability to connect with your customers. Fortunately, you don’t have to take a passive role in the fight. There are steps you can take to help ensure that all of your communications are trusted by recipients.\n\nHow to prevent robocalls\n\nBusinesses that want to prevent or limit incoming robocalls have similar options to consumers. For one, they can simply not answer unidentified calls, although this still presents a distraction from productive work, and may create problems when important incoming calls fail to provide caller ID information or end up inaccurately flagged as fraudulent.\n\nBusinesses can also use call-blocking systems or third-party apps to intercept automated calls and prevent them from causing distraction. Androids and iPhones include options to automatically stop smartphones from receiving suspicious calls.\n\nAddressing the impact from robocalls on contact-center answer rates demand a more tactful approach. Here are several ways businesses can help ensure calls are getting through to customers.\n\nUse real, assigned numbers, and maintain an accurate caller ID\n\nSome of the criteria carriers look for when flagging, or even automatically blocking, potentially fraudulent calls are invalid or unused numbers. Use real numbers, and provide as much relevant information as possible in your caller ID. This will help prevent the number from being erroneously flagged, and will give customers the information they need to decide whether they wish to answer your call.\n\nUse specific numbers for specific departments and services\n\nIf you’re using the same number for all of your outbound calls, you are more likely to get flagged. This is likely because as consumers see the same phone number showing up with increased frequency, they often mistake that number for a robocaller and report it. Giving each department its own assigned number allows you to reach out to customers without inundating them with too many calls from a single source.\n\nTry to only call assigned numbers\n\nRobocalls thrive by casting a wide net, and often call invalid and unassigned numbers while trying to locate possible human targets. Businesses that frequently make out-going calls to unassigned numbers may catch the attention of telephone carriers, getting flagged in the process.\n\nBe compliant with laws and willing to work with service providers\n\nAnalytics companies and service providers are actively trying to eliminate illegal robocalls. Businesses can help by providing them with documentation detailing regular calling patterns (this should include anticipated call volume as well as standard calling hours). Likewise, adhere to the Do Not Call List and remain compliant with relevant laws and regulations. Provide contact information so that call recipients can report any perceived violations. Taking these steps demonstrates your willingness to help, and further distinguishes your businesses from illegitimate callers and scam artists.\n\nUse Hiya Connect\n\nAs one of the most trusted names in caller identification and blocking, Hiya provides the complete range of tools and services you need to ensure that your calls are getting through to the people who matter. Hiya Connect empowers businesses to register legitimate phone numbers and take increased control over how those numbers appear in caller ID.

      "# [Basics to Know About Call Authentication by Alicia Marie Beatty](https://blog.hiya.com/call-authentication)\nThe massive amount of robocalls are frustrating for everyone involved — customers and contact centers alike. Customers don’t want to answer their phone for robocalls and contact centers are having a difficult time reaching customers because they aren’t picking up the phone. In fact, 94% of people don’t answer the phone unless they know who’s calling. Even worse, illegal spoofing allows bad actors to pose as a business or customer with the intent to gain sensitive information.\n\nFortunately, call authentication is in place with the STIR/SHAKEN framework to protect both customers and contact centers.\n\nWhat Is Call Authentication?\n\nCall authentication is a process that verifies the identity of a caller and makes illegal spoofing more difficult. As denoted in the STIR/SHAKEN framework, a certificate of authenticity needs to be attached to every call so that service providers can differentiate legitimate calls from fraudulent calls like illegal spoofing, robocalls, or spam calls. If the call doesn’t match the certificate, then the customer will see a “spam risk” warning on the caller ID.\n\nHow Does Call Authentication Work?\n\nOnce your contact center makes a call, your service provider receives a request to place that call. From there, the provider verifies the source of the call and assigns it an attestation level. Next, the provider creates a SIP Identity header that confirms the information from the number that placed the call. Then when the service provider of the customer you’re calling receives the call, they verify the identity of the header and certificate. Based on this information, the destination provider determines how the call will be displayed (or even blocked).\n\nAttestation levels play an important role in deciding how a call will be displayed on a customer’s phone.\n\nFull (A-level) attestation means that the provider can confirm that the caller is authorized to use the number and that no spoofing has occurred.\n\nPartial (B-level) attestation means that the provider has authenticated the origin of the call but can’t verify if the caller is authorized to use the number.\n\nGateway (C-level) attestation means that the provider has authenticated the location of the call but can’t authenticate the call source.\n\nCalls with A-level attestation are seen as the most trustworthy and least likely to be spam. The display will look different on every customer’s phone, but carriers will try to make it apparent that A-level calls can be trusted.\n\nIf you want to display your business name on your caller ID and have complete control over how your call is displayed, Hiya Connect can help. Our Branded Call feature allows you to display your company name, logo, reason for calling, and more.\n\nCall Center Authentication Best Practices\n\nUnder the STIR/SHAKEN framework, there are a few best practices that your contact center should follow to get a high attestation level.\n\nUse a reputable service provider\n\nRegister the phone numbers you call from\n\nAvoid using least call routing\n\nMonitor the reputation of your numbers\n\nTo check if any of your numbers are displaying spam warning labels, contact us for a reputation analysis.\n\nProtect Your Contact Center from Spoofing\n\nIf a bad actor knows your business number and can find the numbers of your customers, then the groundwork is laid for a scam. By spoofing your number, a scammer can pose as your business and ask customers for sensitive information. If a customer falls for the scam, it can damage the trust that the public has in your organization.",

Thank you for that. But lacking other numerous features still devalues this app, unfortunately. It doesn't have a message button during a call. There is no contacts button in the app. Doesn't support call assistant during the call. Doesn't show the number during the call (when it knows the name, it shows only that.

On iOS, it’s absolutely worthless.\n\nI previously used a competing product that was terrific, but for some reason my current carrier isn’t compatible with too many of these solutions, so I had to purchase a subscription to Hiya instead.\n\nDespite having all settings exactly as required, and even after deactivating and reactivating, the app literally does nothing. It will allow every phone call through, known or unknown, unless you manually enter into the block list, so every unwanted call is going to ring your phone at least the first time.\n\nSecondly, don’t expect the call lookup to give you any information, which is comical because it’s the main point of the app. It almost always comes up as “Unknown Caller” and serves up no information. I almost always have to resort to doing a Google search to investigate the number myself.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, it doesn’t block unknown calls (and yes, I have the phone’s “Silence Unknown Calls” setting on, and all toggles on for Hiya to screen and block calls. It’s not user error), and 99% of the time it can’t identify the caller when using the lookup feature. So tell me, what exactly did I purchase an annual subscription for?\n\nAs I write this, the last update by the developers was four months ago. Doesn’t really instill confidence that there’s any attention given to this app.\n\nI know this review is harsh, but that’s how ineffective and frustrating the app is. Do not waste your money!",

I wouldn't  have known if I hadn't gone into \"blocked calls\" on my S23 Ultra to have  a look after receiving a text notif informing me that attempts made to  reach my by my postal service had failed multiple times today.\n\nI  was hoping - like \"Spam Protection\" on my secondary Pixel device (which  was more efficient) - Samsung's spam call service would at least let it  ring with a \"Suspected Spam\" floating message then give me the option  to answer, reject or block instead of autoblocking. As far as memory  services, this is the first time I'm receiving a call from my postal  service so I hadn't done any prior settings to block it to begin with.\n\nI  don't know how it determines what is spam and what isn't. But it would  be scary to think one day somebody might be in a situation where an  emergency scenario at home occurred and Hiya autoblocks all incoming calls from a family member without the user's knowledge.\n\n## Comment ID k4jlbf5 with +4 score by [(I2iSTUDIOS, Reddit, 2023-10-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1763egw/experience_with_hiya_spam_call_protection/k4jlbf5/) (in reply to ID 1763egw):\nChange the settings to what you desire.

They are a glass repair company. Sometimes they have to ring a customer back to schedule a job or quote/confirm things etc. \n\nRecently it seems Hiya (suspected as it seems to be mainly Samsung phones) has blanket marking nearly all my customer's calls as SPAM. Meaning that THEIR clients don't answer their phones and miss appointments or thinks no-one ever calls them back etc, when instead the calls have silently dropped into their spam basket.\n\nThen I found this article:\n\n[https://commsrisk.com/big-us-call-analytics-firms-hiya-and-tns-blasted-for-conflict-of-interest-over-incorrect-spam-labels/](https://commsrisk.com/big-us-call-analytics-firms-hiya-and-tns-blasted-for-conflict-of-interest-over-incorrect-spam-labels/)\n\nHiya were very proud to announce their use of AI here to classify numbers as spam or not: \n\n[https://www.geekwire.com/2021/spam-smackdown-hiya-claims-massive-step-forward-using-ai-against-illegal-phone-calls/](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/spam-smackdown-hiya-claims-massive-step-forward-using-ai-against-illegal-phone-calls/)\n\nSeems Hiya and services like it may be making a big mess, (or doing it on purpose?) then getting businesses to contact them to clear the numbers from being marked as spam. I'm not sure whether they charge to clear legit number from their database but they have paid tiers so maybe it's just to get a point of contact to the business to try to convince them to buy their product. I won't speculate but it seems possible.\n\nIn any case thanks to the tardy way these services operate (and there's a few of them I'm just suspecting Hiya as it seems to be happening mostly on Samsung phones (that use Hiya)), I have a customer losing their customers and costing them money hand over fist.\n\nI believe services such as this CAN be beneficial for sure but when they get to choose who receives phone calls from whom based on AI without any confirmation about the numbers in question it's like holding numbers to hostage?\n\nIn any case. Big headaches for me and my clients and I hope some authority steps in soon to streamline the system and prevent legit numbers from getting blocked as it can literally ruin a business!\n\n### Comment ID l1kxjs1 with +1 score by [(Fresh_computer_smell, Reddit, 2024-04-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1763egw/experience_with_hiya_spam_call_protection/l1kxjs1/) (in reply to ID kubcwsz):\nThis is a great article.

Cause like the head doesn't stay looking down when it jumps up into flight mode; it goes horizontal.\n\nAlso, swappable wings I guess? A pair open and a pair closed?\n\nAnd on top of all that, the wing span would be smaller than Mothra's with a very similar body size. How do you justify bringing it to $50? Maybe a MUTO cocoon to go alongside it??\n\n#### Comment ID m0teazr with +1 score by [(HiveOverlord2008, Reddit, 2024-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SHMonsterArts/comments/1h83b30/hiya_toys_godzilla_2014_pics/m0teazr/) (in reply to ID m0te5du):\nThe head problem can already be solved since they gave their Mechagodzilla 1993 figure the ability to move his head upward. They just need to figure out how to not make it look weird since HokMUTO has a very weird skull.\n\nHokMUTO dwarfs Mothra in all but wingspan, he was 60 meters tall.

It gets its roots from the Spanish \"amor propio\" -- self-esteem that prevents one from losing or swallowing their pride. \n\nThat itself tells you that in Philippine society, there's another level to \"hiya\" that isn't merely the trait of being shy (*mahiyain*), but being sensitive enough to acknowledge someone else's amor propio by watching out for their ego or avoiding public confrontation.\n\n### Comment ID c8rymha with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2013-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/19wblv/can_someone_explain_the_concept_of_hiya/c8rymha/) (in reply to ID c8rwriw):\nIt didn't originate from the Spanish, I believe it was rooted into the Tagalogs and other native groups' (Such as the Visayans) cultures.

In essence, it's saving face, whether it's yours, or your family's, or another person's. It's interesting to me, because it comes into effect even when one party is clearly in the right, and the other in the wrong -- you hold a private discussion, cushion the blow to the best of your abilities, in consideration of the other person. In fact I've only really paid attention to it once I started working, because I've noticed that it's even more important in an office environment.\n\n## Comment ID c8rw957 with +5 score by [(daddeh_long_legs, Reddit, 2013-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/19wblv/can_someone_explain_the_concept_of_hiya/c8rw957/) (in reply to ID 19wblv):\nThe English translation of \"hiya\" is \"shame\". So \"walang hiya\", a common Filipino insult, means \"shameless\", i.e., \"walang hiya ka\" means \"you have no shame\".\n\n\nRegarding the sociocultural implications, I haven't really given it much thought. Maybe you can say that Filipinos are generally introspective because of language like this. By introspective, I mean being more self-reflective and giving more emphasis/importance to self-perception. Which makes \"walang hiya\" the most scathing form of insult, because it attacks the inner person. Other words/expressions that come to mind which suggest the introspective nature of Filipinos are \"kalooban\" (will), \"utang na loob\" (debt of gratitude), and \"nahuhulog ang loob\" (falling in love). Note that the root word \"loob\" literally means \"inside\" or \"within\".\n\n## Comment ID c8ryoax with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2013-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/19wblv/can_someone_explain_the_concept_of_hiya/c8ryoax/) (in reply to ID 19wblv):\nHiya is context sensitive when translated, but in Filipino, it's one of those specific 'idea' that everyone has a concrete idea of, but is not able to explain.\n\nA simpler explanation is\nHiya is the feeling you feel when you don't conform to social standards.\n\n\n[Here's a good article on 'hiya' and related concepts.](http://suite101.com/article/filipino-values--indigenous-concepts-in-filipino-psychology-a324909)\n\n## Comment ID c8rye9g with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2013-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/19wblv/can_someone_explain_the_concept_of_hiya/c8rye9g/) (in reply to ID 19wblv):\nAt the most basic/shallow level, it translates to \"embarrassment\", \"self consciounses\" or \"shame\" - depending on the context of use.\n\nHowever, at a deeper level, it relates to one's sense of self and sense of propriety. Within this context, \"hiya\" is intertwined with \"self-respect\" and \"respect of place/position\". Thus, with \"hiya\", a person's behavior is limited according to his own sense of who he is and according to the community's expectations based on his place/position in society.\n\n## Comment ID c8rxprb with +4 score by [(mr_paradox, Reddit, 2013-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/19wblv/can_someone_explain_the_concept_of_hiya/c8rxprb/) (in reply to ID 19wblv):\nHiya literally means  ashamed as others have said.\n\nI think you might mean \"nakakahiya\". I am not sure if I am spelling that one right. And probably someone can explain it better then me.\n\nBasically it is when Filipinos get ashamed or embarrassed for no logical reason what so ever. It is like shyness, but multiplied 100x, and more then shyness.\n\nThere is also a word for \"group shame\". I can't remember it off the top of my head. This has serious social implications. If another member of a group of Filipinos does something wrong. All of the members of the group will feel ashamed, it is in my opinion as if they feel as if they have done the wrong act. As a result instead of addressing problems, Filipinos will attempt to find excuses or cover up for the bad Filipinos behaviour.\n\n## Comment ID c8rw76h with +1 score by [(TwistedStack, Reddit, 2013-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/19wblv/can_someone_explain_the_concept_of_hiya/c8rw76h/) (in reply to ID 19wblv):\nDepends on context.\n\nMahiyain = Describing somebody as shy.\n\nWalang hiya = Saying somebody has no shame.

          "content": "It’s hard to fathom how this company stays in business with such a poor app. It must be because it’s used as the default call ID/blocker on Samsung phones. On iOS, it’s absolutely worthless.\n\nI previously used a competing product that was terrific, but for some reason my current carrier isn’t compatible with too many of these solutions, so I had to purchase a subscription to Hiya instead.\n\nDespite having all settings exactly as required, and even after deactivating and reactivating, the app literally does nothing. It will allow every phone call through, known or unknown, unless you manually enter into the block list, so every unwanted call is going to ring your phone at least the first time.\n\nSecondly, don’t expect the call lookup to give you any information, which is comical because it’s the main point of the app. It almost always comes up as “Unknown Caller” and serves up no information. I almost always have to resort to doing a Google search to investigate the number myself.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, it doesn’t block unknown calls (and yes, I have the phone’s “Silence Unknown Calls” setting on, and all toggles on for Hiya to screen and block calls. It’s not user error), and 99% of the time it can’t identify the caller when using the lookup feature. So tell me, what exactly did I purchase an annual subscription for?\n\nAs I write this, the last update by the developers was four months ago. Doesn’t really instill confidence that there’s any attention given to this app.\n\nI know this review is harsh, but that’s how ineffective and frustrating the app is. Do not waste your money!",

They give you free service for identifying, reporting, and blocking spammers. They don’t keep asking or tricking you to subscribe to their premium service.\n\nFor some reason, their FAQ on the website said you can block spoofed calls with specific area code and prefix by tapping the Protect tab, but the Protect tab doesn’t exist in the latest version. I don’t know if it’s a Premium subscription feature only b\n\nI only allow them to screen and block callers. For privacy reasons, I don’t allow any app to screen my text messages (or collect any data from messages even though most email apps scan for junk emails, they could collect data on your private communications which is why most public email accounts are free to target their ads to you, text messages are much more private than emails to allow them to collect data from).

Starting to think cricket is selling personal information to the vultures and they own this app.  When calling cricket customer service, I asked to speak to management but since they are an off shore company “they have no way or refused to” connect me to any rep in the United States.

      "# [Hiya News: Global Phone Spam and Fraud Report: Nearly a Third of All Unknown Calls in First Half of 2024 Were Unwanted](https://www.hiya.com/newsroom/press-releases/global-phone-spam-and-fraud-report-nearly-a-third-of-all-unknown-calls-in-first-half-of-2024-were-unwanted)\nSeattle, Washington (August 22, 2024) — Hiya, the global leader in voice security, has published H1 2024 Global Call Threat Report, which explores the volume, frequency and type of phone spam and fraud across major global markets between January and June of 2024.\n\nDownload Hiya’s H1 2024 Global Call Threat Report to learn more:\n\n‍https://hiya.com/global-call-threat-report\n\nIn the first six months of 2024, Hiya flagged nearly 20 billion calls as suspected spam – more than 107 million spam calls everyday. Hiya’s data showed spam flag rates of more than 20% of unknown calls (calls coming from outside of someone’s address book) in 25 out of the 42 countries included in the report – with some spam flag rates above 50%.\n\nThe first half of 2024 also saw an increase in AI deepfake scams, which use AI-generated voice-cloning technology to impersonate people and/or organizations. Ahead of the primary election in January, voters in New Hampshire received robocalls impersonating Joe Biden using an AI-generated voice. As AI tools become more powerful and accessible, Hiya anticipates that voice-cloning impersonation scam tactics will continue to be on the rise in 2024 and beyond.\n\nMedicare and insurance scams continue to target Americans\n\nAmericans received an average of 14 spam calls per month in the first six months of 2024. The rate of spam flag rate varies state-by-state with Oklahoma, Indiana and Ohio having the highest rates of spam in H1, while Alaska, New York and North Dakota had the lowest. Health insurance and medicare scams were popular in the US between January and June followed by other insurance scams, including auto, home, and life. Tax scams were also on the rise in the first half, and steadily increased leading up to the April 15 tax filing deadline.\n\nFrance and Spain continues to have the worst spam across Europe, for past 7 quarters\n\nMore than half of all unknown calls in France and Spain were unwanted – with spam flag rates of 53% and 51%, respectively. On average French and Spanish residents receive more than 12 nuisance or fraud calls each month. Despite similar spam flag rates, Spain has a bigger fraud problem as 12% of unknown calls are fraud compared to 5% in France.\n\nThe most commonly reported fraud calls in Spain were utility and mobile phone sales scams. In February, a new TikTok scam call emerged as users reported robocalls offering 800 Euros a day to watch and like videos on TikTok. Utility related scams, including electricity suppliers and solar energy, were the top scams in the first half of 2024 in France. Telemarketing calls, banking-related scam calls and package delivery scams were also common.\n\nUK residents are targeted with tax agency and Amazon scams\n\nThe UK had a spam flag rate of 28% of all unknown calls, and 3% of those calls were fraud in H1. Popular phone scams across the UK in the first half of the year included tax scams, specifically impersonating Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), Amazon scams and credit card scams. Cryptocurrency, energy-related and immigration scams were also on the rise.\n\nBrazillians receive the most spam calls per month across the globe\n\nBrazillians received an average 26 spam calls per month in the first half of 2024. More than half of the unidentified calls in the country were spam (51%) with 13% of those being fraud. Banking scams are the most popular phone scam across Brazil with Hiya users reporting scammers impersonating a bank and calling to confirm personal information and passwords.\n\nAmazon scams surged across Canada\n\nWhile Canadians only received an average of 4 spam calls per person each month, 7% of those calls were fraud. In 2023, Amazon scams were the most popular scam targeting Canadians and continued into the first half of 2024 – hitting a peak in mid-April. Scams impersonating government officials were also popular in H1 followed by credit card and cryptocurrency scams.\n\n“Phone fraud, spam and the emerging use of AI-driven deepfake voice scams are escalating threats to the voice channel, affecting every phone user across every major market,” shared Kush Parikh, President of Hiya. “The voice channel deserves the same level of vigilance that enterprises apply to cybersecurity. In fact, voice security must be swiftly integrated into cybersecurity strategies, as it represents a significant vulnerability in protecting enterprises.”\n\nHiya report methodology\n\nThe H1 2024 Global Call Threat Report is based on a representative sample of calls observed by Hiya on the Hiya Voice Security Network, which includes Samsung Smart Call enabled devices and the Hiya mobile app. The spam ratios in this report represent unknown calls outside of an individual’s contact list calls that Hiya has identified and flagged as either fraud or nuisance.\n\nDownload the complete H1 2024 Global Call Threat Report to learn more.\n\nAbout Hiya",
      "# [‎Hiya: Spam Blocker & Caller ID by Hiya on 2015-07-29](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hiya-spam-blocker-caller-id/id986999874)\nI have been using this app now for many years. When I first started using it the App was not really bad , but I can’t say everything got blocked and it was a 100% useful tool! Because it wasn’t, but I hung in there and over the years it has gotten better and better. Why because the Technology kept changing and as it did the fight to combat the Crooks got stronger and I could see on my end that I was not getting the Bad calls from Telemarketers and people who wanted to steal my money and identity if I was stupid enough to give them the opportunity! So now HIYA has gotten to the point for me I seldom get those calls now Days. Oh I still get one now and then but the Crooks are not stupid they change their number as fast as you can blink. But the Technology of this app has gotten for me where the number change is being picked up and blocked! I wish I could go back to a phone book or an operator or just being able to pick up the phone and answer it when it rings. But those Days are gone never I hate to say will they return. But my Friends Hiya has really put out this Unique Outstanding Design App to Protect all of us. So Hiya I Tip my Hat 🎩 to you for creating a 5 Star ⭐️ app through all of these years. So on my end I want to say “ Thanks ! “.\n\nThis app has discontinued many free features and made them premium, with a subscription. But the parts that are remaining do not work well. I have\n\nthe setting to Block Scam and Fraud, and Spam calls- but it doesn’t. At least, not all the time. I don’t know if it actually blocks any. I still get them, and there is no icon warning that it’s a scam or fraud. Just got another one today, with no indication- but after the call and voicemail, I checked the number on Hiya- there was a months worth (over 45) of reports and comments left, all reporting the same scam. If they haven’t picked up that number then they need to figure out why not. The listing on my recent calls still shows nothing, no comment, no icon.\n\nUpdate, weeks later: I had two calls yesterday, one of which I missed and one I declined, from the same number. No indication what they were. I checked later on Hiya and found that they were “debt collectors”- only after I checked did the icon for that appear in my recent calls list for this number. Hiya is always open on my phone, so even if it’s a recent number it should be updated.\n\nAnother update: telemarketers’ calls are not labeled as such. I’m not sure if it’s worth keeping this app on my phone- it hasn’t “warned” of anything, but I get voicemail messages from telemarketers, since I don’t answer calls from unknown callers.\n\nThis app was meant to be able to look up who is calling you/identify incoming calls and enhance blocking options. Now they are mostly focused on being a call screener. Rather than the first screen being the lookup screen it’s now a nag screen to enable call screening. I didn’t buy this to screen my calls. I bought this to identify calls manually. Now I have to go to the “keypad” section and there is supposed to be a paste lookup button at the top. Sometimes it’s there and sometimes it’s not. And when it is there I have to give it permission to paste every single time even when I choose always allow and confirm in Settings that the permission is always allow. Lately more often than not the button is not there unless I restart my phone making it more of a nuisance than a help. Don’t think I’ll be renewing since the whole purpose of the app is to allow me to lookup calls when I want and now it’s become very cumbersome and they are just interested in me in allowing them to intercept my calls, which I don’t want. I have all the updates of everything on my phone so that isn’t the issue. The app has been problematic since they implemented the call screening. No longer worth it. It has gone from best app for call identification to very low on the totem pole. Many apps now that handle it better. Another case of an app going from doing something well to an app trying to do everything and now doing none of it well.",

Similarly, USANA may leverage Hiya’s market data insights, marketing expertise, and children-focused products within its direct sales channel.\n\nChannel Expansion into Direct-to-Consumer Wellness Market with a Leading and Proven Brand. Hiya currently holds a leading position in children’s Vitamins, Minerals & Supplements brand sales in the United Statesⁱ and has a clear pathway and strong growth strategy to become the #1 children’s wellness platform through new product introductions, channel expansion, and geographic expansion.

The transaction meaningfully expands and diversifies the Company’s revenue mix as Hiya’s net sales are generated in the United States through their direct-to-consumer subscription model, with plans to enter other sales channels. This will allow USANA to reach a broader audience of health-conscious consumers to grow the enterprise’s overall customer base.\n\nⁱ Source: Nielsen\n\nTransaction Highlights\n\nThe Company made an initial cash investment of approximately $205 million (subject to customary closing and post-closing purchase price adjustments) in exchange for a 78.8% ownership stake in Hiya.\n\nTransaction structure includes a put/call feature that provides for USANA’s acquisition of the remaining rollover equity at a pre-negotiated valuation scale, which is based on Hiya’s financial performance.\n\nThe transaction was financed with $200 million cash on hand with the balance covered by the Company’s existing credit facility.\n\nBofA Securities acted as exclusive financial advisor to the Company in connection with the transaction.

We believe that this non-GAAP financial information of Hiya may be helpful to investors as an indication of future cash flow generation. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.

      "# [Hiya News: Hiya Launches First AI Call Assistant That Stops Live and Deepfake Scams in Real](https://en-ca.hiya.com/newsroom/press-releases/hiya-launches-first-ai-call-assistant-that-stops-live-and-deepfake-scams-in-real-time)\nSeattle, WA (January 28th, 2025)– Hiya, the global leader in voice intelligence services, has introduced Hiya AI Phone, an AI call assistant mobile app. Designed for busy professionals, Hiya AI Phone acts like a personal assistant, saving time by screening unwanted phone calls, safeguarding against phone scams, and taking notes during calls to ensure seamless follow-up.\n\nManaging phone calls has become increasingly challenging, with professionals losing valuable time each month to robocalls, scams, and unknown numbers. According to data from Hiya, on average, Americans spend 40 minutes each month screening 13 unwanted spam calls. This figure is likely higher for busy professionals due to the necessity of answering potentially important calls so as not to miss business opportunities. The stakes are even greater with the rise of sophisticated threats: recent research by Hiya (a survey of 2,000 US consumers conducted by Censuswide in January) found that in 2024, one in three Americans received at least one deepfake scam call, with 34% of those targeted losing an average of $7,200. Hiya AI Phone offers tools to streamline communication, detect synthetic voices, and safeguard users from scams—empowering professionals to stay connected, productive, and secure.\n\nCore Features of Hiya AI Phone\n\nIntelligent Call Screening\n\nQuickly identifies callers and their intent, blocking spam and irrelevant calls to maintain focus on important conversations. How it works: An AI assistant answers all unknown calls on your behalf, asks callers to state their name and purpose, and evaluates whether to connect them to you. When appropriate, the AI assistant connects the call, sharing the caller's name and purpose, allowing you to decide whether to accept the call.\n\nScam Protection\n\nDetects scam calls in real-time to shield users from bad actors and impersonation attacks. How it works: The app continuously analyzes your call audio in real-time, using advanced AI models trained to detect scam language and other indicators within conversations. It alerts you instantly if it identifies potential scams—whether from a person, a recording, or an AI-generated voice. The app alerts you of the risk by vibrating your phone and displaying a clear on-screen warning, helping you stay one step ahead of scammers.\n\nVoice Deepfake Detection\n\nDetects AI-generated voices and deepfakes, protecting individuals and busy professionals from sophisticated scam attempts. How it works: The app uses advanced AI models trained to analyze your calls in real-time, detecting subtle patterns in the audio that indicate a voice is AI-generated or AI-modified. When an AI voice is identified, the app instantly alerts you by vibrating your phone and displaying a warning, ensuring you're always aware of potential deception.\n\nIntelligent Call Summaries & Transcription\n\nAutomates note-taking by converting conversations into easy-to-reference summaries and instantly extracting important events that can be added to your calendar, saving individuals and busy professionals valuable time. Call summaries and transcripts can be shared to avoid recapping conversations. How it works: Call conversations are automatically transcribed and summarized using AI models tuned by Hiya. All your call data is encrypted and remains accessible only to you on your device. Hiya does not store personal or call data on its servers without consent.\n\n“Hiya AI Phone represents a groundbreaking evolution in how people interact with their phones,” said Hiya CEO and founder Alex Algard. “For years, phone apps have stagnated, offering little innovation since their introduction on smartphones. The launch of Hiya AI Phone changes that by introducing the first call assistant purpose-built to navigate today’s challenging call landscape—dominated by robocalls, spam, deepfake scams, and other interruptions. Mobile phones are the ideal platform for AI to make a meaningful impact, and transforming the call experience with a digital assistant that works seamlessly for you on your calls is the perfect starting point.”\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nHiya AI Phone is free to download for Android and iPhone users, with premium features available via subscription for $9.99 per month. Users can access a free two-week trial and cancel anytime through their app store settings.\n\nLearn More\n\nVisit www.hiya.com/products/apps/hiya-ai-phone to explore the full features of Hiya AI Phone and read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.",
      "# [Two: Hiya Chowdhury by The Adroit Journal on 2025-01-25](https://theadroitjournal.org/issue-fifty-two/hiya-chowdhury/)\nBack to Issue Fifty-Two\n\nFuneral Home\n\nBY HIYA CHOWDHURY\n\nWhen Rania dies, we put her on a half-price mattress on the living room floor because there is nowhere else for her to go. There are no pyres left in the city.\n\nOur living room is already small—which is true of all the houses in Azaad Colony—but it feels much smaller today because Rania takes up so much room. But she is a tiny person. She is so tiny it’s hard to believe that she should make anything look so small and suffocating, as opposed to making everything look impossibly, devastatingly large. She is too tiny for sixteen. Sometimes, when she drags herself over to my side of the bed on the coldest nights of the year, I sense her little feet propped up against mine and feel oddly maternal. Like I’m some big well of endless heat burning into the night. And like she’s a toddler: she lugs one skinny arm across my torso and traps my legs under hers, and though it takes a few minutes, the chill slowly melts away from inside the covers. Her face bores into mine—hollow and sharp against my fuller cheeks—and we sleep this way till summer comes, at which point she shifts to her side of the bed obediently even though I don’t ever complain. And then the year trudges on like it always does, and I no longer get to hold my sister—my little sister, who slipped out of Ma only a minute behind me—and pretend that the world stops moving, that the winter becomes warmer in Azaad Colony whenever she wants it to. But time has not stopped for me. I wonder when I can make the switch; when I will have to relent and let Rania become a thing of the past.\n\nThe last time Rania touched my side of the bed, I was dressing her in something more presentable than her scooby-doo nightie from when we were children. I outgrew mine years ago: I bloomed into my limbs and my chest and my shoulders so much quicker than she ever did, and scooby-doo stretched across my skin till he was a brown blob on the soft cotton cloth, his plastic face cracked and splintered in places. And then it was too inappropriate for me to wear but Rania could still wear it inside the house, though only in front of Ma and me. Ma is strict about these things. She only allows us to forgo shame in front of the women we are related to, and I think she is stricter about this when death is involved. This morning, Ma took me aside and asked me to put Rania in something that other people can look at.\n\nMy mother is the adult in this house: she is not much older than me and so much younger than my father, but she is always right. Today, there is an immense power in everything she is doing. When she speaks, it is a grunt, something hollow and brittle. She is moving around the house swiftly, picking things up and dusting things down and preparing for the long day that is coming, all the while muttering something under her breath. It is likely a chant, or a prayer: when she comes to the end of one couplet she pauses for a moment, closes her eyes, and flattens herself against the nearest wall. Then she is off again, cooking for the company we will inevitably have today, replenishing the tea leaves in the kitchen and the soap dish at the bathroom sink, throwing away fresh, unused tablets from Rania’s medicine box.\n\nMa is telling me to do certain things–like dressing Rania, or holding Baba’s hand when he cries–because she thinks I need direction after what has happened. For all our efforts to keep Rania alive, none of us had considered what we would do at the very moment of her death. I woke up at dawn today with her head on my chest, turned to face me: she looked asleep, but this sleep was sound like it had never been before. When I tried to wake her, she slithered into my arms like she had no structure at all, supple and slick like a fish out of water. I believe I screamed and thrashed in place till Ma and Baba stormed our bedroom, but I don’t remember much else. The next thing I remember is Ma grabbing the meatiest part of my arm with the sharpest points of her nails and shaking me like I was the last bit of frozen ghee inside the tin, refusing to come unstuck. Then she told me to pull out the pink kameez. I think she thinks that if Rania is dressed in her pink kameez, with its careful embroidery and shapeless frame, nobody will say that she was one of those truant girls who went and invited death into Azaad Colony.\n\nBut it is very hard to dress a body when it does not want to be dressed. I could barely achieve it. I fiddled with her limp arms, stuffed all the extra skin into sleeves, held her neck so gingerly between my cheek and collarbone that I could have let it snap. I told myself that this Rania was not my Rania. No, this was gudiya, the old rag doll we played with as children. Baba had rescued her off the top of the colony dumpster when Rania and I were four. She had come to our house smelling of Gold Flake cigarettes and paan spittle, and Ma had boiled her in saltwater till all the red in her cheeks had faded away into the steam. While gudiya had dried off on a clothespin in the verandah, Ma had sewn her a new dress overnight with a maternal electricity in her fingers that nobody had seen since her tailoring days, and that nobody saw again. Gudiya, uselessly fluttering in the wind, had needed to be pinned down and wrestled into her little outfit until she was brand new.\n\nFor a moment, when my father takes Rania from our bed to the mattress, the death mattress, the mattress that will never quite leave us, it feels as though gudiya—pale, boiled, discoloured—is lying in our living room. Only now she is life-size.\n\n*\n\nThe weather has only just begun to turn in Azaad Colony. The neighbours’ voices are becoming more hoarse everyday; the construction crew working on the unfinished metro flyover across from the colony are turning up in two, three, four layers of itchy hand-knit cardigans; the air is dense with little puffs of white breath and cigarette smoke. It’s that time of the year. Down at the chai stall, Ramesh-bhai’s youngest boy is secretly mixing rum into the chai and selling it for an extra twenty rupees by special order only. Mindless noise: the little whispers exchanged over the tinkling steel utensils, the brief, staccato thud of palms hitting the wooden table and coming away with crushed elaichi and little shards of clove stuck to them. The soft slurping, the burning, agitated exhale that only the local variety of rum can produce. It is very alive, in a way that is difficult to stomach.\n\nBy afternoon the winter has flooded our house too, making everything still and stern. Rania looks serene: pink like the inside of a mouth against the textured, grey-black mosaic floor. The sight of her has finally folded Ma into a small, dilapidated shape on the sofa, her knees grinding against her belly, saree falling off her shoulder, spiralling down from the brusqueness of the morning. She is looking at Rania so carefully that she is almost not looking at all. Baba is pacing around the room, clutching the landline phone to his chest and waiting for the dial-tone to become a voice. He pauses at Rania’s feet every time he comes close to her. Sometimes, as he walks past her, he unspools a strand of her hair by mistake and dips down like a small sparrow to tidy it back into place. I am trying to stay very still to keep out of his way. All I really want to do is put a pillow under Rania’s still head, as though she is suddenly a newborn with a soft spine that needs to be cradled. The news says to try and prevent contact with the diseased body, but it does not say what to do when the body has died. Is the body still diseased? Is Rania still sick if she is not Rania at all? The questions pinch my head like the tooth comb Ma uses to take lice out of our hair.\n\nBaba only stops pacing when the phone connects. Immediately, the house is awake again: Ma’s head comes off the sofa, Baba brings the receiver to his ear with such speed that I don’t even see it happen, and I almost expect Rania to move too. Baba barks obscenities into the mouthpiece: Motherfucker, I have a dead daughter, don’t tell me you can’t cremate her! You have to! Spit goes everywhere. No, I can’t bury her, are you a fucking idiot? We don’t bury anyone! The dial-tone comes back. Ma’s head falls down as quickly as it came up. Baba begins to pace again, now quicker. He stretches the phone cord from one end of the living room to the other, wrapping us all in wire, ​​sealing Ma and Rania off together to one side of the room with the sofa set and the dirtier end of the rug. Like this we wait for the next call to connect, even though we know that all the funeral grounds are overflowing and people are dying in the streets. In the midst of all this a chilly sleet comes grating down on the roof of our house, filling everything with an empty clattering sound. I cannot hear when Baba dials the next number, and what it is he says.\n\n*\n\nSome people from the colony materialise on our doorstep, and I know that more are on the way. I wonder who tells them that Rania has died. I try to imagine the possible chain of communication: at some point, Baba must have called Jitesh-uncle, who works with him at the bank, then Jitesh-uncle would have told his wife, his wife would have run down to the colony park, which is really just a sandy plot of land where the women gather every afternoon to gossip and sip chai, and they would have told Ramesh-bhai, and then Ramesh-bhai’s boy would have told everybody else who came to the stall.\n\nI understand why they are collecting outside our house like this, toeing the threshold of our small verandah and waiting to be called in. Nobody like Rania has ever died in Azaad Colony. They must be so perplexed, so bitter at whatever power has cursed our colony this way: none of them knows what has really happened, or at least none of them knows for certain that Rania was one of the diseased. The ones who suspect it are not here; they will never come here again, and maybe it is for the better. But like Ma and Baba, most of the others don’t believe what the news says about protecting people from all this deadliness. They say that the news gets in the way of how we live our lives in the colony.\n\nThe front door is open. In its place, the mesh, fishnet gate is latched tight against our door frame, telling everyone that we are not ready for them yet. I imagine this upsets them: these are not patient people. Privacy unsettles them, as though private people are always holding on to some disturbing secret that will hurt them. They try to coax the secrecy away, nurse it into submission. At the threshold of the door, just in from the rain, they all look like they are bleeding into each other. Sushma-didi’s big nose and her two soggy pigtails fuse with Fattoh-jaan’s dark skin and leaky eyes. Sushma-didi’s hair is the colour of Lalit-uncle’s dripping moustache, and two shades darker than little Ronnie’s tousled, greasy hair; they are all standing next to each other like a wet tapestry. Only Rukhsar-aunty from next door is standing a little further away from everyone else because she knows that Ma doesn’t want her near the house. Rukhsar-aunty, with her neon knitting needles and sparkly hijabs and long painted nails, is watching us intently from her own verandah opposite our house, but her face is hard. I cannot tell what she is thinking, or if she is thinking of us at all.\n\nIn Azaad Colony, there is no choice but to love them all and to be watched by them all. The colony is small. There is tenderness here that must be repaid. Sushma-didi taught us history in the fifth grade and skipped over all the boring chapters in the textbook, like the ones about peculiar hillside vegetation or the Bolshevik revolution. Ma hates Fattoh-jaan, but she always slides me free mango candies under the cash counter at her canteen. Lalit-uncle plays football with the children in the colony and always loses on purpose. When the construction crew employs someone new, Ronnie shows them bike tricks on the dirt road that separates us from the flyover. And Rukhsar-aunty is our keeper: she keeps our secrets and tells us stories. Often she sits outside the schoolyard a few kilometres from the colony and waits for the children to leave their classes and flock around her for their regular story-hour.\n\nThere is one story she tells particularly well: it is about how a long, long time ago, the chief minister had wanted to bankroll a new gated colony in the outskirts of the city, something far enough away from himself to make people forget that he was, after all, a terrible chief minister. It was supposed to be a wonderful place to live in, with twenty-storey buildings, with a real park for the kids, so close to the metro and the hospital and a school—there was even a fountainhead somewhere. The Municipal Corporation came promptly, showing everybody that they could be prompt when the men in patloons and topis needed them to be, Rukhsar-aunty would say. Then they razed down all the trees and they burnt down the houses that we made on this land. They took everything: my school photo, my red saree, my namaaz mat also! Kutte! Rukhsar-aunty would spit into the sand, and the little flecks of foam would land on the earth like pebbles.\n\nThen she got to the meat of it. Something had happened back then—the government ran out of money or there was some court dispute or a worker ran away with the chief planner’s wife—but it had made the construction stall for a couple of months. Bas, that’s where we jumped back in! We just swooped in and took our land back; now Rukhsar-aunty would whoop and cheer and the children would join in, already late for their afternoon baths. Everybody came together and we built it back into our home. The chief minister can’t hurt us, you watch! It’s true, nothing ever happened. The big men didn’t care enough. The people who lived here—about two hundred of them, all with small families—put up smaller, flimsier houses than the Corporation would have liked, and Ramesh-bhai set up his stall next to the basin of the half-finished fountainhead. Some colony members got jobs with the construction crew booked for the flyover, which has been halfway built for decades now. This felt like betrayal because it was a Corporation job, but it got us electricity and running water. Then they opened up a bank in the district and attracted people like Baba, who had real degrees but nowhere else to go, and so that got us a TV. Houses with a bedroom and a kitchen. Refrigerators.\n\nThe year all the houses came up, somebody found a number plate from some unfortunate car lying in a corner of the dirt road and carved the words Azaad Colony onto its back with a blade. Now it sits on our gate, telling everyone that we are far enough away from anyone who actually matters to consider ourselves free.\n\nI do love them all. They are all we have. They are bursting through the seams of the verandah, aching to be invited in, to touch the girl who has died and to comfort those who loved her. This is what it means to live in this colony. The more they all look at us, the more dead Rania becomes.\n\n*\n\nMa hates it when people look at Rania. Rania is loud and likeable, which terrifies her. In the summer holidays, Rania would trot up to Fattoh-jaan at the canteen, streaking through drunken men singing folk songs, and she would ask her for two-rupee glasses of lemonade while I stood outside staring at my feet. Then she sat there for hours, delicate and wild in a rickety chair, hair knotted in the summer loo, till Fattoh-jaan raised her eyebrows at me and I took Rania away. The next day, Ma’s gaggle of colony women would gossip ferociously about the devil girl she had raised (Socho, sitting with all these men, drinking Fattoh’s lemonade! Fattoh, of all people!) and so Ma would pick up old newspapers in the evening and snap welts into Rania’s knuckles. Then when Ma took us to the women’s kitty parties in the colony so that we, too, could lay claim to our womanhood, Rania shoved greasy, fried kachoris into her salwar pockets and smuggled them into my hands on the way back home. And then we chuckled so hard that peas fell out of our mouths and our noses caught fire, and Ma would only know the truth if she saw our fingers before we washed them—mucky, coated in mashed potato and a thin sheen of sweat.\n\nMa tried to pray the rebellion out of us the best she could. Each morning, she put her ceramic idols on our pillows and pricked our palms into a prayer before we could protest. Little postcard pictures of Ma’s gods were lodged into odd cracks in the house— under the fridge magnets, next to the kitchen sink, in the lining of the sofa set—and she liked to know we were always being watched. Her faith has odd rules. You didn’t eat anything na, Ma asked us in a higher register than usual after we spent an evening with Rukhsar-aunty without having told her first. She heckled Feroze-mama when he walked past the temple with his skull cap on. Ma, who never sewed gudiya another dress, dug her nails into our cheeks and stuffed holy prasad into our mouths on the verandah and beamed back at Azaad Colony. Still, Rania would usually spit her share into a roadside ditch, and we’d watch the sweet, yellow blob float away with the rotting leaves and litter and candy wrappers into nothingness.\n\nWhen Rania got sick, then, I know exactly what Ma didn’t say out loud: that it was god’s will.\n\nRania and I were there, right in the thick of things, when it first began. Or at least we were paying attention. Three months ago, when the city first started to get sick, everything was under control. People were dying of a mystery disease, but not so much that it was on every news channel. Only on the really serious ones, and then, later at night, on the ones that enjoyed conspiracy theories. Rania and I rummaged through the kitchen every night after Ma took her sleeping pills. We brought out jaljeera and banana wafers and guava quarters in rotation to watch moustachioed men wring their hands and scream that the city was falling into ruin because Jupiter was too close to the Earth or because the Prime Minister had bought himself a secret pet parrot that spoke Urdu perfectly. We would fall over in splits, Rania’s head quivering on my lap and her feet crossed up against the living room wall, spitting guava juice all over the floor.\n\nAnd then when it wasn’t funny anymore, we switched channels. Then everything was slick with gore and shiny white powders and awful-looking tubes, and enough people were sick that the pattern was clear; Rania and I were keeping our limbs to ourselves and scribbling symptoms into the backs of our geography notebooks. First, the fever would mount, then the body would squelch into new pains every hour, and then the skin would blister into odd shapes till everything melted away into the bleached hospital sheets. The whole process took three days, and the sickness travelled like fresh, hot gossip. Some people said that it entered the body like a doomed lover and killed you from the inside. Some other people said that the young bounced back fast, faster than the others. But the people who recovered were no better than the ones who had died. The news cameras were unkind, so naturally they showed us everything: people climbing hospital gates with sick mothers strapped to their backs, whole slums contracting the illness in a week, doctors sending oxygen cylinders into the streets for the beggars, even a mourner pulling a pistol onto a sea of onlookers for the last empty spot on the funeral ground. Most people were very particular about the kind of funeral they wanted. Those who wanted to go by fire would never go noiselessly into the land.\n\nOnce people started lugging their dead into backyard bonfires, the government banned the sale of kerosene. Soon after, they worked up a new memorandum with Malaysia to import firewood for the hindu pyres: teak and pine and oak, scraps and logs and planks. Then the defence minister held a major press conference where he clarified in a nasal croak that the Prime Minister did not, in fact, own a Urdu-speaking parrot. He would never, he said, palms folded together, he would never betray your trust that way. Then for a few weeks everyone wondered whether or not he was lying, and by the time they decided he was, it didn’t matter anymore. Rania and I watched everything till she went to school one day and came back with a red nose and a burning forehead. After that, I didn’t watch at all.\n\nThe four of us told no one for the first two days, and then that was all we had with her. During those days, Ma prayed, Baba rifled through all the medicine boxes in the house, and I pushed tablets and powders down my sister’s throat to make her fever manageable. When the pains came, Rania screamed at all hours of the night; it was this dog-like, uncouth thing that didn’t belong to any language. She begged and begged me to cross the brief distance I had ordered between us. I couldn’t help but touch her then, and we fell into each other: I let her rest her head on my chest and put her feet over my calves like we did all winter. I massaged her frequently, starting with the shoulders and moving downwards, downwards. Her hair was matted and sweaty against my collarbone, and when the boils erupted across her torso, they were surprisingly soft. I touched them while she slept sometimes, imagining how much worse they would look on my full belly when I got sick too. But I was never afraid: who was better prepared for this than us? There was nothing in the world we hadn’t shared. I was only dipping a finger into her sickness and tasting it. I drew closer and closer to her every hour, breathing her air and pushing my heat into her body like I always did. It was like standing outside Fattoh-jaan’s canteen, waiting for Rania to come back so that I could follow her stride to our next adventure.\n\nThere is a story people often tell us. When Rania and I were born, the midwife had soaked her bloody hands in a warm-water bath on the floor where Rania now lies, waxing gruffly to Baba about how I had wrapped my arms so decisively around Rania’s midsection that we both could have died on the way out, simply crumbed off onto the old bedsheets, stuck to Ma’s legs. I thought about this when I was holding Rania so close that we were one and the same. I wanted her to take me with her wherever she went.\n\n*\n\nThe rain turns into darkness. The crowd of spectators outside has rearranged itself; some of them have left, and new people have filled in for those old or tired. In the darkness, the whites of their eyes are glistening hungrily, like fox-eyes peering through a shehtoot bush. They want to come in. They think we have grieved alone for long enough and now it is time for us to let them help. The verandah will not hold them much longer: they want to touch, breathe, caress this tragedy. Some of them might suspect the truth, but their sense of caution is not as sticky, or as persistent, as their affection.\n\nBaba is finally sitting on a chair he has drawn into the room. The phone wire is wrapped around his wrist and the receiver is dangling off the side of his palm. A newspaper page with the numbers of the last ten funeral homes in the city is tucked away under his armpit. He is steeling himself to ring the next number when something changes.\n\nJostling to the front of the crowd, Doctor places one hand on the mesh gate and peeks into the house as though it were his own. Suno, baraf laao, he says, looking only at my father. Ice, we should keep the body cold. She will need ice. Ice? None of us like him very much: Doctor is an old man who sticks us with needles even when we don’t need them and touches us leisurely on the examination table. He has a degree from somewhere nobody has ever been. But we trust that it exists because he has framed it and keeps it high on the walls of the clinic he runs out of his house. The golden lettering on his name shines across the room and it makes us believe that he knows more than the rest of us do.\n\nSo when Doctor says the body needs ice, everyone ticks into action. Baba snaps his neck in Ma’s direction and she floats off the sofa and begins to peel ice trays out of the fridge, rubbing her arms vigorously to keep herself warm. The crowd outside descends upon the task furiously, finally unleashed. Baraf laao! Bring the ice, somebody yells again, and the people break into a run till everyone is cawing the bizarre battle cry. Ice trays get passed down from hand to hand, verandah to verandah. The barrier breaks. Little Ronnie shovels ice cubes out of his jacket pockets and puts them on Rania’s lips. Rukhsar-aunty sends her ice trays with a stranger and nods at me from her verandah, and then disappears for hours. Fattoh-jaan’s only hindu busboy comes into the house with the yellowing chunks of ice they use to keep the expired beer cold at the canteen. They all tip their offerings onto Rania’s chest from where they slither to her waist like snails, watery trail in tow.\n\nThey are all touching each other, brushing shoulders and offering to hug my father in turns. Somebody takes the landline phone away from him and begins to dial new numbers. Some of the women have penetrated the inside of the house and have found my mother; they are shaking her by the shoulders, maybe to make her cry. They are all already crying. There are people kneeling next to Rania, covering her with their tears and snot, the rainwater dripping off their bodies. Somebody is caressing her face, somebody is beating their chest. Next to me, someone explains to little Ronnie that the ice is to keep the body fresh. Fresh for what? I want to vomit because they make Rania sound like a mutton chop, waiting to be cooked. Ronnie asks if the ice will bring her back home. When finally someone grabs me by the shoulders and pulls me into a hug, I can think of nothing that feels better, that feels more like home, than this invasion. My body warms at their touch and I let myself think, for just a moment, that the news lies to me.\n\nLike this, the night begins to pass. The crowd has quietened but it has not left us. People are draped over the sofa, they are leaning against our dining table, they are changing the final bedsheets that held Rania. Somebody has discovered the tea leaves in our kitchen cabinet and is promising to make chai for everyone in the house to ease the pain and the cold. I still cannot move and have greeted nobody, not once raised my arms to welcome someone in. Ma is sitting next to Rania on the floor, running one hand through her daughter’s hair, tidying out its many knots. Soon, when the trays of tea come spilling out of the kitchen, Baba takes advantage of the distraction and crouches on the floor next to my mother. Baba says that he has made his way through the phone book and the newspaper; Rania’s body is warm again, all the ice cubes are a soggy, undone imitation of what they used to be, and still nobody will cremate her. He raises a hand to touch Ma’s face, but suddenly thinks better of it and clears his throat. Can we be picky anymore? There is no more wood, there are no more fires, he says. He pauses. I suddenly remember that Baba never threw out the shirts he wore to Fattoh-jaan’s on the weekends, not even when Ma asked.\n\nThe next thing he says is a secret, a whisper, to be hidden from our neighbours and friends. We let this happen. We should have known better. And now, with all of these people–she needs to go, I can call someone who knows a burial–\n\nIf you bury her, you’ll watch me die too.\n\nMa cuts him off in the middle of his sentence, as though all that had to be said on the matter had been said already.\n\n*\n\nWhen dawn finally starts to break, Baba sends them all home.\n\nI think we could all do with some sleep.\n\nWho will sit with her?\n\nEverybody looks at me, and so I do. They all filter out in a haphazard line, having done their duty. There are tea cups all over the house, laced with spit and smudges of lipstick. Baba swallows a sleeping pill dry and then pops one into Ma’s throat and suddenly, everything is still.\n\nI peel my feet off the floor and stand over Rania, my hair falling over the wrinkles on her eyes, swollen from all the ice water. Nobody ever said we looked alike when we were children. So Ma dressed us in identical short-sleeved kameezes and ruffled frocks that she made on the sewing machine, so that our minor similarities–the curve of our noses, the mole on our right hands, the shine in our hair–became impossible to ignore. Back then, our faces would blend into one in the bathroom mirror and we would giggle so ghostly at the suggestion that we could be the same person, living the same lives and wanting the same things to be true. A giggle comes up now like vomit in my throat. I am already moving to stifle it when the vomit, real vomit, erupts into my mouth. I feel bile swing up to my lungs and flood my chest and I run towards the door, towards the mesh gate, into the verandah, and then outside to the edge of the dirt road, where I throw up nothing but water and the remains of a forgotten butter biscuit. I am retching uselessly in the corner, tears rushing to my eyes with every heave. I do this till the retching stops and only the tears keep moving.\n\nBachha, come here.\n\nI hear a voice behind me and I know who it is. Rukhsar-aunty taps on the railing around her verandah with one of her knitting needles, the sky behind her turning the same shade as her soft pink hijab.\n\nSuddenly we are walking through her house—empty and dusty in the corners. Rukhsar-aunty pinches crescents into my wrists with her long, shapely nails, which have some kind of brown muck lingering on their ends. She wraps her dupatta around me, as if to say that people have died before and that they will die again. I don’t want to hear it till she stretches her arm out and pushes open the back door to her house to reveal a prickly piece of land with a single, nearly dead sapling in a corner.\n\nHer voice again. There.\n\nAt first, there is nothing remarkable about what she is showing me. What is she showing me? And then all of a sudden it makes radiant, absolute sense, the way waking up from sleep or being born does. There is a shovel lodged into the handle of the door, a mountain of soil in front of the sapling, and the beginnings of a deep cavity in the ground that nobody has found yet, that nobody has taken away from us.\n\nWe don’t have anything else, Rukhsar-aunty says, squeezing my hand.\n\nI am strangely punctured by relief. The sapling in the corner of the backyard catches the light of the rising sun and I think of the harshness of a hospital light, the anger of the funeral flames, the smoke that sticks to everything when a body is burnt. I think that my mother is a devout woman who hates this house and the kind of people who live within it. I think of her gods and her anger and how the vein on her temple throbs when she turns righteous. And then, I think of Rukhsar-aunty, who has no children except the children of the colony. I think of the things we must share in Azaad Colony, when push comes to shove. I think about Rania living only one house away, forever. I think about crawling into a hole in the ground with my little sister, with all of Azaad Colony watching, and staying there forever, perfectly still.",
      "# [Protecting Our Subscribers with Hiya: A Seamless Solution to Combat Spam Calls by Ishank Jain on 2025-01-24](https://www.transatel.com/news-and-insights/blog/protecting-our-subscribers-with-hiya-a-seamless-solution-to-combat-spam-calls/)\nIn an era where mobile communication is integral to both personal and professional lives, the rise of spam calls and unwanted solicitations has become a pressing concern for consumers. As a Mobile Virtual Network Enabler (MVNE), we are committed to providing our subscribers with cutting-edge solutions to enhance their mobile experience. We are excited to announce the launch of the Hiya platform on our network, a robust and innovative native solution designed to protect our subscribers from spam and unwanted calls without the need to download an additional app.\n\nProtecting Subscribers from the Rising Threat of Spam and Fraud Calls\n\nSpam and fraud calls cost UK subscribers billions annually. Hiya Protect leverages AI-driven call analysis to block scams, notify users, and restore confidence in phone communication.\n\nSpam and fraudulent calls are increasingly affecting UK subscribers, causing significant financial losses and consuming valuable time. A recent study by Hiya revealed that 28% of calls received are spam or fraud-related, costing consumers £16.5 billion annually and wasting an estimated 484.5 million hours. This alarming trend has also led to a shift in user behavior—92% of subscribers now view unidentified calls as fraudulent, creating challenges for legitimate businesses trying to reach their customers.\n\nWhat is Hiya?\n\nHiya is a highly effective call protection service that seamlessly integrates with our network, enabling real-time identification and blocking of spam calls. This solution leverages an extensive database of known spam numbers and uses advanced algorithms to identify new threats as they emerge. By proactively preventing these calls from reaching your device, Hiya aims to provide peace of mind to our subscribers.\n\nHiya Protect: A Game-Changer for Call Security\n\nOne of the standout features of Hiya is its native integration, meaning it works directly on users’ devices through the BT network. This eliminates the hassle of downloading and managing another app, allowing subscribers to enjoy a cleaner interface and a more straightforward experience. The solution is also designed to deliver privacy and security, as it ensures that users’ data is handled with the utmost care and compliance with relevant regulations. This service notifies recipients if a call is likely safe, flags suspicious ones, and fraudulent calls outright. It operates seamlessly without the need for user setup.\n\nHiya offers several beneficial features:\n\nReal-Time AI Analysis: Hiya instantly recognizes spam call patterns and automatically blocks them based on their likelihood of being unwanted. This significantly reduces the number of nuisance calls reaching our subscribers.\n\nAutomatic Blocking: Filters out invalid phone calls at the network level, ensuring they never reach the user’s device.\n\nCaller Identification: Users can see the names and locations of incoming calls, providing clarity and context before answering. This helps in distinguishing between important calls and potential spam by categorizing calls into four distinct risk levels: Invalid Phone Calls, Fraud, Spam, and Neutral.\n\nUser Reports and Feedback: Our subscribers can participate in the Hiya community by reporting spam numbers. This feedback feeds into the system, enhancing its ability to recognize and block new threats quickly.\n\nUser-Friendly Experience: Since Hiya is a native solution, it works in the background without disrupting the user’s typical phone experience. Subscribers can benefit from call protection effortlessly, they simply have to decide what calls they answer based on the on-screen display.\n\nEnhanced Subscriber Experience\n\nHiya Protect benefits all MVNA UK clients (Except FMC clients), who can activate it on a per-subscriber basis. However, call categorization labels are visible only for users within the UK using IMS (4G calling). Subscribers on roaming or without IMS won’t see the labels.\n\nWith the deployment of Hiya, our goal is to enhance the overall user experience for all our subscribers. We understand how interruptions from spam calls can be frustrating, distracting, and time-consuming. By incorporating this advanced spam call protection into our network, we aim to create a safer communication environment where our subscribers can focus on what truly matters.\n\nWe are continuously working on improving our services and solutions, and Hiya represents a significant step in that direction. We encourage our subscribers to take full advantage of this feature and embrace a hassle-free communication experience.\n\nSupported Devices\n\nMost devices with number or text display capabilities, including SIM-enabled wearables, support Hiya Protect. Devices connected via Bluetooth may have limited functionality for label display.\n\nWhy Hiya Protect Stands Out\n\nHiya Protect’s AI-driven approach continuously adapts to evolving scam tactics, significantly reducing unwanted calls. While no system can guarantee 100% protection, Hiya offers a robust shield against the rising tide of spam and fraud, safeguarding subscribers while restoring trust in phone communications.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the launch of the Hiya platform marks an important milestone in our journey to provide unparalleled value to our subscribers. By seamlessly integrating this spam call protection, we are taking proactive steps to secure our users’ communications while allowing them to connect with the people and businesses that matter most.\n\nFor more information on how to get started with Hiya or to learn more about our other services, please contact our customer support team. Together, let’s eradicate spam calls and enjoy a more secure mobile experience!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",
