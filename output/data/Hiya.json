      "# [Imposter Apps and How to Spot Them: Chronicles of App Store Imitators by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/imposter-apps/)\nImitation is the highest form of flattery. If that’s true, we at Hiya should be thrilled to see so many apps in the App Store claiming to be Hiya. Somehow it doesn’t quite ring true though.\n\nImposter apps are looking for one thing: money. As such, they “build” fake apps, load them onto the App Store, charge money for them and then sit back and reap the financial benefits until Apple shuts them down. Then, they rinse and repeat with another app.\n\nIn Hiya’s case, we now have scammers scamming an anti-scam company. Consider the gauntlet thrown.\n\nHow can you tell if an app in the app store is an imposter?\n\nDeveloper name: Hiya’s developer name is Hiya. Simple! It should be recognizable or a name that you can easily look up and verify. Note: the developer name will not always match the app name (for example, Hiya also owns the Mr. Number app), but, with a little research, you should be able to confirm if the developer is indeed legitimate.\n\nWebsite: In the app store, we link toHiya’s Web Site and ourHiya Caller ID and Block Support page. Imposter apps will have links as well, however, they don’t function or will lead to a page that has nothing to do with the app.\n\nCost: Did you hear from a friend that Hiya is free? They were right! If you go into the App store and all of a sudden, you have to pay for a “free” app, you’re looking at an imposter.\n\nReviews: One of the most important tools at our fingertips. As fake apps are just that – fake, they will not function as they are supposed to. After paying $1.99 for an app and it doesn’t work, you can bet reviews will come in and they will not be pleasant. Take a look at the reviews. Sure, Hiya doesn’t get 5 star reviews all the time (nobody’s perfect…not yet, at least), but, we have a wide range of positive reviews from many users. Imposters will have only a few reviews and they will not be positive.\n\nImposters will receive a few, very bad reviews",
      "# [Amazon Scam Calls to Watch For | Hiya by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/amazon-scam)\nAmazon is in an enviable position of being a top retailer and having global brand recognition. The flip side of that, however, is that its notoriety makes it a prime target for scammers. Fraudsters making random robocalls have a good chance of reaching someone who has an Amazon account.\n\nAmazon has operations on five continents and has dedicated websites in 13 countries. It’s no wonder that Amazon phone scams are common in many countries, including\n\n#1 phone scam in Canada\n\n#1 phone scam in the UK\n\n#2 phone scam in the US\n\nHow do Amazon scam calls work?\n\nNo matter how hard you try to keep your phone number private, scammers have several tactics to obtain contact information. There are data brokers that find personal information online and sell it to third parties. Scammers can purchase this information and then contact you about your Amazon account. Scammers can also obtain any personal information that was leaked during a data breach.\n\nOnce they have your phone number, scammers make a call from an unknown number or one that was spoofed to appear as if it were coming from Amazon. The scammer then claims to be part of the Amazon customer support team calling about an issue with an order or a notice of a security breach. The scammer then attempts to gain your personal information (like your Amazon account username and password or credit card information) by claiming that this information is necessary to resolve the issue.\n\nSamples of Amazon scam calls\n\nBelow are transcripts of actual Amazon scam calls. These are from the Hiya honeypot: a collection of Hiya-owned phone numbers used to capture the content of scam and nuisance calls. Here is the wording of the three most common Amazon scam calls observed by Hiya:\n\n“Hello. This is Amazon. This call is to authorize a payment of $999. We would like to inform you that there is an order placed for an Apple iPhone 11 Pro using your Amazon account. If you do not authorize this order press 1, or press 2 to authorize this order.\n\n“This is a confirmation call from Amazon regarding your purchase of iPhone 13 Pro Max and Apple Airpods, totaling $1499. But we have found some suspicious activities in your account while processing the payment. So in order to cancel your order, kindly press 1 to speak with the Amazon fraud department.”\n\n“Hello. Amazon Express notice. A courier delivered twice and no one has signed for it. For details, please press 1.”\n\nEach call has a common element: the robocall asks the recipient to press a number, which will connect with a phony Amazon representative. Instead of wasting time making live calls, the scammers start with a robocall, and if the recipient falls for the scam and presses a number, a live operator will attempt to get the victim to reveal their Amazon account information or credit card number.\n\nReports from Hiya users\n\nIn addition to the honeypot, Hiya also receives user reports from consumers using Hiya Protect via their carrier, device manufacturer, or the Hiya mobile app. Here’s a sampling of the Amazon scam calls users are reporting:\n\n“Multiple calls from multiple numbers to convince me to let them help with a fraudulent purchase on Amazon.”\n\n“Claims to be from Amazon. Usually, a message that wants you to call them back about an order, then they try to pump you for information.”\n\n“Claiming to be Amazon to renew a monthly fee of $99 per month. If you speak to a consultant to cancel, they request your bank details to stop the payment.”\n\nHow to protect against scam calls\n\nCarriers can add Hiya Protect, a complete call protection solution that enables carriers to protect their subscribers by blocking and labeling spam calls, and helping them identify wanted calls. Hiya Protect recently added a new layer of protection, Personal AI, which personalizes call protection to individual subscribers so they receive the calls that are important to them and are protected from targeted attacks.\n\nWith Hiya Connect, enterprises can improve customer engagement and loyalty while protecting their customers from deceitful interactions and their brand reputation from inaccurate spam labeling. Get a free Reputation Analysis report to see if your customers are at risk.\n\nIndividuals can check with their phone carrier to see if it offers any spam/scam-blocking capabilities. If not, ask your carrier to consider adding Hiya Protect.",
      "# [What is enterprise branded call? Display a branded caller ID | Hiya by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/branded-call)\nWe’ve all had the experience of seeing an unknown number pop up on our phones. Without thinking, we answer the call, only to hear, “[car warranty scam beginning.]” The frustration we feel from this spam call, coupled with the frequency we experience it, leaves us with a sour taste in our mouths. It’s no wonder 87% of consumers believe unidentified calls may be fraudulent. And for call centers that regularly make outbound calls, this has detrimental effects.\n\nThat’s why branding your calls with your business name is so important. With a Branded Call, the caller ID displays a caller’s company name, location, logo, and other identifiable information before the call even starts. Instead of seeing “unknown caller” and worrying about the nuisance of a potential spam call, a Branded Call allows customers to identify and trust the source of a call immediately.\n\nLet your customers know you're calling. With branded caller ID, display your company name, logo, and location to engage with more people, faster.\n\nBenefits of enterprise branded caller ID\n\nAlthough agencies like the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are trying to use their resources to stop the exponential increase in spam calls, they’re simply aren't given enough to respond to the rapidly evolving scam tactics deployed by scammers.\n\nTrust\n\nWhen consumers cannot trust the calls coming from your business, it starts affecting their perception of your brand. Imagine you are waiting for a call from your food delivery service on the status of your order. Time goes by and you haven’t received an update. You’d be pretty frustrated and your confidence in the company would plummet. While the delivery driver could have been calling you all along, you didn’t answer the calls because you didn’t know who was calling. As more and more customers stop answering their phones for unidentified calls, this damaged reputation can snowball into massive losses as customers choose other delivery services.\n\nSecurity and spam\n\nFraudsters are always ready and willing to impersonate well-known companies—and with people more connected to their phones than ever before, telecom scams are their method of choice. But with Hiya’s Branded Call, by providing your company name and logo, you can assure your customers that your call is legitimate. Hiya also offers Secure Call, an additional feature that pre-authenticates outbound calls before they are made, securing your branded caller identity, and protecting your customers from falling victim to fraudsters using your numbers.\n\nBranding\n\nThe customer's experience of the call will influence whether they have a positive or negative perception of your business. A Branded Call will help create a visual experience that draws the customer in and increases their positive association with the business and its call center. Word of mouth is a powerful marketing vehicle, so it is important to remember that positive interactions often lead customers to spread the word.\n\nIncrease answer rates\n\nImagine you get two calls—one says “unknown number” and the other says a company’s name. Which one are you going to answer? Call centers with a branded caller ID through Hiya report an average 80% increase in answer rates. Customers pick up the phone when they know who’s calling.\n\nWhat are the risks of not having an enterprise branded caller ID?\n\nAt this point, you should be quite familiar with the fact that branded caller ID can improve the efforts of your contact center dramatically. But what are the risks associated with not having a Branded Call? Consider the following:\n\nUnanswered calls\n\nWhat do most people do when they encounter an unknown number? They ignore the call. According to Hiya's State of the Call survey, 84% of consumers think an unidentified call is fraudulent. As a result of being unable to communicate essential information to your customers, your company’s bottom line will suffer.\n\nThe challenges of unidentified calls\n\nIn today's digital age, trust is paramount. When a call comes in without a clear indicator of who is calling, many consumers hesitate to answer, fearing potential scams or unwanted solicitations. Imagine eagerly awaiting an update on your food delivery order. Minutes turn into hours, and there's no word. Your frustration mounts, and your trust in the service wanes. Unbeknownst to you, the delivery driver may have been trying to reach you, but their calls went unanswered because there was no clear indication of who was on the other end. This scenario is becoming increasingly common as more individuals opt to ignore unidentified calls. As this trend continues, businesses face the risk of eroding customer trust and loyalty, potentially leading to significant losses as customers turn to competitors with clearer communication channels.\n\nHow Hiya can help\n\nWant to know how you can brand your business name on your outbound calls? calling an iPhone or Android? Getting Hiya Connect can help you change your caller ID to accurately identify and increase your answer rates. The Branded Call feature helps call centers display their company name, logo, and reason for calling. This will help your business contact the right individuals while building trust in your brand. Hiya’s Voice Performance Platform also gives you the ability to:\n\nTrack the impact of Branded Call over time\n\nMonitor your caller reputation health\n\nUnderstand why calls have been blocked or reported\n\nSecure calls and prevent number hijacking",

      "# [What Are Sales Optimization Best Practices? by Alicia Marie Beatty](https://blog.hiya.com/sales-optimizations)\nOptimizing your call performance strategy can be a difficult, arduous task--made even worse if your team is constantly hiring and training new agents. Many managers find it difficult to focus their team’s efforts on activities that will maximize revenue. We’ve been there, and we’re here to help.\n\nThe word “optimization” is used so frequently in business conversations that the meaning often becomes masked by other definitions. Managers will frequently, mistakenly use “optimize” in lieu of other, more appropriate words like “growth” or “high performance.” And though these definitions may appear to be quite similar, using the words interchangeably will cause your sales team to miss out on golden opportunities.\n\nIn this article, we’re taking a minute to break down what sales optimization really is, why it’s critical for your success, and how you can begin implementing best practices today.\n\nWhat Is Sales Optimization?\n\nSales optimization is the process of analyzing and improving sales performance to achieve maximum revenue. Good managers evaluate the performance of sales teams and provide training to help agents develop skills that lead to wins.\n\nOptimizations are important in every industry, but it especially applies to the work done in contact centers. Because outbound calls are so repetitive, it can be easy for agents to develop bad habits through lack of focus. Optimization occurs when agents consistently use best practices to increase the likelihood of closing sales.\n\nOptimization Best Practices\n\nThere are many things that contact centers can do to maximize their sales revenue. Here are three ways to take your optimization strategy to the next level:\n\n1. Set Long Term Goals\n\nSince sales optimization is all about choosing the most efficient path to success, it’s important to start by visualizing your end goal. Set goals based on yearly revenue and sales, and keep those goals top of mind.\n\nA common misstep: call center teams tend to focus more on short-term goals than they do on long-term goals. Weekly, monthly, and quarterly goals are only useful if they provide a clear path to achieving long-term business goals. Because sales optimization is all about adjusting performance over time, you’ll need to be careful to not get so focused on hitting this quarter’s numbers that you forget about the bigger picture.\n\nSome managers find it difficult to create lasting, measurable goals, instead opting for short-term goals that are easy to achieve. This is understandable, since long-term goals are usually more high-level and difficult to track. Although they are typically more difficult to track, long-term goals can be, and usually are, more closely aligned with the call center’s mission statement than short-term goals. However, it is impossible to optimize for long-term goals without having a way to measure performance metrics. In short, make sure your goals are tied to a measurable KPI that can be tracked. An example of this might be, ”increase sales by 13% by the end of Q3.” This example hits the sweet spot between setting a goal for your team without being prescriptive or restrictive about the ways in which they go about achieving that goal—creating focus, and allowing for innovation to discover new methods of optimization along the way.\n\n2. Use A Voice Performance Platform for Sales Optimization\n\nSales optimization platforms (like Hiya’s Voice Performance Platform) provide all the tools you need to successfully implement software sales strategies. With these tools for data collection and analysis (and, on a premiere software like Hiya, customized insights) you can stay on track for reaching your long-term goals. Good platforms will also include solutions to common problems call centers face, such as security, reputation management, audience analysis data, and more.\n\nWhen deciding on a voice performance platform, pay attention to what’s offered; is the software cloud-based? Does it contain fraud filters? And is the data self-service, on demand, and accessible 24/7? Sales optimization platforms that include these features can be far more valuable than standard, static caller registries, as they go beyond the basic information provided by your dialer. Choose a platform that will best meet your company’s needs and help you achieve your long-term goals.\n\n3. Make Data-Driven Decisions\n\nThe best sales processes always include an emphasis on tracking and analyzing data which allows managers to make decisions based on actionable insights. While everything up to this point has been important, this step is where the most tangible, significant results happen.\n\nMaking business decisions that are rooted in data does two things to your sales performance. First, it gives you an imperial metric to guide you in an industry that is all too frequently subjective. You can’t fool numbers. Second, it gives you a way to measure the efficacy of your initiatives. Many sales optimization platforms, such as Hiya’s Voice Performance Platform, will allow you to identify lead quality -- an invaluable resource for your agents. While it’s not an exact science, if your decisions aren’t backed by data and tracked in an organized manner, you’ll have no idea if an initiative is making an impact.\n\nAs you track your team’s performance, pay attention to trends in data. For example, if you notice a sudden drop in answer rates, it may be a sign that an imposter is spoofing your calls. No amount of training your agents will improve that metric. Once you’ve discovered a spoofing problem, you can take action by securing your calls and giving customers the confidence to answer. Fortunately, many sales optimization platforms, including Hiya Connect, can help notify you when problems like this arise and can solve them before they have a chance to negatively impact performance.\n\nUsing Hiya Connect for Sales Optimization\n\nHiya Connect, a Voice Performance Platform, is the industry-leading platform for performance analytics. Its intuitive dashboard integrates all of your metrics in one platform, allowing for a clear, comprehensive view of your performance. Hiya also provides data-driven insights to give you actionable steps to improve call performance. These are a few examples of how Hiya Connect can help you reach your optimization goals.\n\nCall centers may come across a sudden decline in answer rates, which may signify an imposter attempting to spoof your calls. Customers become conditioned to not pick up the phone anymore after they’ve received spam calls from numbers that look similar to your business numbers. Hiya Connect protects against spam labels and secures network connections, so you will never have to face this issue again.\n\nWhat if your answer rates were never high to begin with? Hiya Connect provides call centers with branded calls, which display your company name, logo, and a custom, informative reason for calling. Answer rates increase significantly when the prospect knows the identity of the caller.",
      "# [Evolution of Phones and its Affect on Society by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/telephone-transformation/)\nThe smartphones we possess today have come a long way from the first rendition of the telephone back in 1876 when Alexander Graham Bell invented and patented the first short-range phone. But like people, phones have evolved throughout history to cater to our lifestyles and needs.\n\nHere’s a look at how telephones have transformed over the years…\n\nShort-Range Phone: Despite a number of individuals from around the world who’ve contributed to the invention of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell was the first to receive a patent for his short-range phone in 1876. Testing out the phone in his Boston laboratory, he rang his assistant Thomas Watson, and become well known-for saying, “Mr. Watson, come here – I want to see you.”\n\nCandlestick Phone: The candlestick phone became popular in the 1890s through the 1930s. Separated by two pieces, it featured a mouth piece (transmitter) mounted at the top of the stand, and a receiver (ear phone) that the user would hold to their ear during a call.\n\nRotary Phone: Pushing out the candlestick phone, the rotary phone came about in the 1930s when manufacturers began to combine the mouth piece and receiver of the candlestick phones into a single unit. When dialing a rotary phone, what originally started as lugs, but evolved into holes, one would then rotate the dial to the number that they wanted and then would release the dial.\n\nTouch-Dial Phone: On November 18, 1963, the Bell System unveiled the first electronic touch-dial phone system with touch-tone dialing. It would become the worldwide standard for telecommunication signaling. Using audible tones for each of the digits on the push-button keypad, specific frequencies were designated to each row and column. The tones helped the switching center determine which key was pressed.\n\nFirst Mobile Phone: On April 3, 1973, Motorola researcher and executive, Martin Cooper, made the first mobile telephone from handheld subscriber equipment. Weighing in at 2.4 lbs and measuring at 228.6 x 127 x 44.4mm, Cooper was said to have called a rival telecommunications company and let them know he was talking to them on a mobile phone. The prototype was able to give a caller 30 minutes of talk-time and took about 10 hours to charge.\n\nCordless Phone: Cordless phones became a hot commodity in the 1980s but was originally invented by a female Jazz musician named Teri Pall in 1965. The handset cord of the telephone was replaced with a radio link. However, Teri’s invention would not hit the consumer market until a decade and a half later.\n\nFirst Portable Phone: Even though Martin Cooper invented the first mobile phone, the first portable mobile phone was the MicroTAC which was introduced in 1989 as “an innovative new “flip” design”, where the “mouthpiece” folded over the keypad, although the “mouthpiece” was actually located in the base of the phone, along with the ringer. Up until its release, most cellular phones were installed as car phones due to the inability to fit them into a jacket pocket.\n\nNokia: Through the mid-90s and into the early 2000s, Nokia mobile phones catered to consumers, with interchangeable faceplates, customizable designs, the first WAP browser, internal antenna, T9 Text messaging, and eventually an LCD screen and internet connectivity.\n\nFirst Camera Phone (Sanyo SCP-5300): Possessing the first camera phone, the U.S. finally adopted the Japanese trend in November 2002. The clunky clamshell design could capture photos at 640×480 pixels and had a basic flash, white balance control, self-timer, digital zoom, and various filters (sepia, black and white, and negative colors.)\n\nCrack-Berry (BlackBerry): Blackberry made waves with their popular RIM communication device in 2003 which possessed a phone, PDA, and e-mail system all in one hand-held phone. The term crack-berry came about when users constantly checked their e-mail and sent short messages through their device.\n\nSleek Mobile Design (Motorola Razr): First developed in 2003, the Motorola Razr hit it big when it was marketed as a fashion phone due to its sleek and thin profile. Over its four-year run, they sold over a 130 million phones and were named the best-selling clamshell phone in history.\n\nSmartphones: Dating back as far as 1997, it wasn’t until Japan became the first mobile market to popularize the smartphone in 1999. As BlackBerry, Palm, HTC, Windows Mobile, Samsung, Nokia, and Motorola made a name for themselves in the early 2000s, their smartphones had the capability to email, fax, and search the internet. As the smartphone craze escalated, cell phone manufacturers tested a number of functionalities that would help them capitalize on the new trend. From sliding, flipping, rotating, vertical, and even multiple keyboards, touchscreen smartphones made their way into the market which also introduce the stylus. However, the functionality these phones offered were still targeting more business users versus consumers.\n\nCue in iPhone 3G. The first of its kind, the original iPhone was the first touch-screen smartphone that was unveiled in June 2007. Apple’s take on the smartphone combines “multimedia functions with the same email and Web browsing features as all other smartphones previously had. It had a large color display with a capacitive digitizer, and its user interface was finally finger-friendly. And unlike phones before it, the iPhone had only one button on its face – the Home button – and three around its edges, two for volume up/down and one for power/standby.” reports the “The Evolution of the Smartphone” from PocketNow.\n\nToday, iPhone has paved the way for a number of other cell phone manufacturers to create their own version of the smartphones we love today. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg on how phones have evolved over history, but it’s apparent that as phones change, engineers will cater to the needs of consumers. What do you think the evolution of phones will come up with next?\n\nKeep on top of all the trends in Voice with Hiya's State of the Call report below.",

      "# [iPhone FAQ](https://www.hiya.com/faq-ios)\nÂ\n\nGetting Started\n\nWhere can I learn more about using Hiya?\n\nYou can learn more at our Help Center here.\n\nHiya is not working correctly.Â What is one thing I can try before I try anything else? (The Fail Safe)\n\nThe fail-safe: Consider the fail-safe the app version of calling IT Support and them asking if you restarted your computer.\n\nHowever, itâs important to note that when you uninstall the app, you will lose the numbers in your blocklist. With that said, use this as a last resort if you have an extensive blocklist. (âSave Blocklistâ functionality is a popular request and we are looking into it for future updates).\n\nDisable Hiya in Settings\n\nForce-quit Settings\n\nUninstall Hiya\n\nRestart your device\n\nReinstall Hiya\n\nThe enable Hiya option in the iPhone settings is not working. What do I do?\n\nFirst, our latest update on iOS has experienced issues with enabling and/or updating. We have been in communication with Apple and this is a known bug. Apple offered a workaround that seems to work (and it doesnât require an uninstall of Hiya which causes you to lose your blocklist). So, if you are experiencing issues after updating to the latest version, please try this:\n\nWait at least one hour after Hiya gets into a bad state. Reboot the phone, then try to enable Hiya again and it should correct itself.\n\nIf this doesn't work then try the fail-safe just above.Â\n\nMy Caller ID name is wrong. How do I change it?\n\nIf you notice your number is incorrectly labeled as spam, or you notice that wrong information is shown or missing from your own number or someone elseâs or, if you would like to remove your information from our services altogether, please click here and we can help you.\n\nHow do I report inaccurate or offensive comments?\n\nIf your number has inaccurate or offensive comments please follow the steps on this linked form and we can look into getting them removed for you.\n\nI have been waiting for the activation code but have yet to receive it. What gives?\n\nWe use Facebook Account Kit for our SMS code verification. Unfortunately, we have no control over whether it works or not.Â With that said, we want it to work as much as you do. Here are a few tips that may help:\n\nTry the fail-safe (noted at the top of the article).\n\nMake sure you have âUnited States (+1)â selected (assuming your phone is, indeed, a U.S. number)\n\nOnly use numbers, donât start with 1 or +1\n\nEnsure your device is subscribed to a texting plan and can receive short-code messages. This one sounds obvious, but weâve had a few instances where users (and even one of our own developers!) had short-code text messages auto-disabled through their carrier. If you arenât receiving activation codes, it is worth a call to your carrier to ensure youâre supported.\n\nCall Blocking\n\nHow can I block Spoofed Calls / Neighbor Scam (calls that show as my area code and prefix) on Hiya?Â\n\nThere is a way to block spoofed calls in the iPhone app.Â In the Hiya app, tap on options in the bottom right, then scroll down to the Spoofed Calls / Neighbor Scam option and choose block.Â You can also choose to alert instead of block.Â\n\nPlease be aware that the block option will block all calls with your area code and your prefix.Â Even those in your contact list.Â This is something that we will fix in the next release in the next couple of weeks.Â In the meantime, the alert option is probably your best bet.Â\n\nWhy is the iPhone app blocking a contact from calling me?\n\nDo you have a contact in your iPhone that is blocked from calling you and you're not sure why?Â You might have to change a setting to fix it.Â Â\n\nIn the Hiya app, tap on Options in the bottom right, then scroll down to the Spoofed Calls / Neighbor Scam option and choose Alert or Do Nothing. Â The block option for spoofed calls will block all calls with your area code and your prefix.Â Even those in your contact list.Â This is something that we will fix in our next iPhone release.Â In the meantime, the alert option is probably the best bet.\n\nIs there a way to prevent blocked calls from going to voicemail?\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot prevent blocked calls from going to voicemail. This is a limitation from Apple that prevents us from hanging up on blocked calls. As soon as Apple lifts this limitation, we will eagerly make it available. We want to hang up on them as well.\n\nIs there a way to see calls that have been blocked?\n\nUnfortunately, not. This is another implementation detail from Apple that we canât work around (we can provide a blocked calls list with Android). We have no idea why we canât have a âHey! Weâre awesome and hereâs a list of calls weâve blocked for youâ section somewhere. The day that changes is the day youâll see it.\n\nIs there any way to block all unknown caller ID/private callers?\n\nUnfortunately, thereâs no way to block all unknown callers, in the app or iPhone itself. We can only block an actual number that is recognized by caller ID. Android has some cool features like block by area code, but at this time, we canât provide that feature on iPhone.\n\nIn iOS is there a way to import or export the block list after un/reinstalling?Â\n\nWe donât have a âsave block listâ function right nowâ¦ However, it is a popular request so we are looking into it.\n\nProtection\n\nHow do I use Hiya to look up unknown numbers?\n\nFirst copy the unknown number from your Recents within the Phone application and then open Hiya. Hiya will ask you if you want to identify the number you just copied. Tap âyesâ and Hiya will look up the number for you.\n\nWhat are the steps for copying phone numbers?\n\nTo copy a phone number, go to your Recent calls within the iPhone Phone application and tap on the info icon (the âiâ with a circle around it) for the number you wish to look up. Once youâre on the contact card, press the caller's number and hold it for a couple seconds. The option to copy the number will appear. Tap âCopyâ and the number is ready for you to paste into other apps.\n\nHow do I look up numbers with the widget (iOS 8 and above only)?\n\nFirst install the Hiya widget. To install the widget, pull down the Notification Center. Make sure you are on the âTodayâ tab. Scroll to the bottom and tap âEdit.â You will be shown a list of apps that have widgets available. Tap on Hiya to add the widget.\n\nNext, copy the number you want to look up from your Recent Call Log. Pull down the Notification Center and scroll to the Hiya widget. The phone number will be automatically identified there.\n\nHow does Hiya identify incoming scam and spam calls?\n\nHiya adds an address book entry containing hundreds of phone numbers for known-to-be spammers and scammers. Because scammers and spammers are constantly changing their phone numbers to avoid detection, we update our entries at least once a day, often more.\n\nWhy does an inbound call not get marked as spam, even if Hiya reports show it as a spam number?\n\nThere are a few things here.\n\n#1) Our database of spammers is gigantic. Unfortunately, we are not able to enter every single spam number in the world into CallKit. We have to be picky and so we choose only the spam numbers that we have the highest confidence in to ID on the incoming call. For the remaining numbers, sometimes youâll have to manually look them up in the app to see if they are Suspected Spam or not.Â\n\n#2) When a call comes in, we look up the number to see if itâs spam. Usually, it takes less than one second, but sometimes it simply takes longer and calls can get through.\n\nI have installed the app, but so far no calls have been identifiedâ¦.?\n\nIf calls are not being identified at all when you get them, then something has probably gone wrong. A simple check is to see if any calls are identified in the native phone call log. You should see some Hiya entries in there if itâs working.\n\nIf not, revert to the fail-safe (see above) and then, go back into the app, in the Call Protection tab, click on âUpdate Nowâ and give it about a minute to update, then check the call log again.\n\nAre spam numbers updated in the background or do I have to manually launch the app occasionally to update?\n\nIf you enable Hiya (through the phone's Settings> Phone> Call Blocking and Identification), then our spam lists will update in the background. Leading to our next ever-popular questionâ¦\n\nI enabled Hiya in the phone's settings, why does the app continually tell me I need to go in and update (by showing a red dot on the app icon)?\n\nAnytime the spam list updates, you will receive a badge notification on the Hiya icon. This is to let you know that itâs working and updating. If you prefer not to see this, you can disable badge icons in your Settings (the spam lists will still continue to update, you just wonât be notified as such).\n\nTo disable badge icons follow these steps:Â Go into your settings for the iPhone itself.Â Go to Settings> Notifications> Hiya>Â and then disable âBadge App Icon.âÂ\n\nWhy do the number of scam and spam calls I am protected from keep changing?\n\nScammers and spammers are constantly changing their phone numbers to avoid being blocked by our app. We update the lists of scammers and spammers at least once a day, as long as the app is active to ensure that you stay protected from unwanted calls.Â Typically a scammer's number will only be active for 2-5 days before it is shut down by it's own provider.Â When a number is shutdown and deactivated we take it off of the total blocked list.Â Â\n\nWhat is the difference between scam calls, spam calls and blacklisted calls?\n\nScams are calls trying to get you to send them money or are found to be fraud in some other way. Spam calls are calls from telemarketers, bill collectors, solicitors, etc. Spam is not dangerous, but can be very annoying. Blacklisted calls are from numbers that you choose to blacklist because you want them blocked. This is someone such as an ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend or anyone you just donât want to talk to.\n\nHow do I use the spam check dialer?\n\nGo to the âCallâ tab in the app and type in the phone number you want to dial. If no spam is detected, then the call will go through. If the number you are dialing is identified as spam, you will be warned and asked if you want to continue with the call.\n\nDoes the âreal-timeâ notification only work over wifi or 3g?\n\nHiya doesnât require any network connection; if you can receive a phone call, it works!Â You will only need a connection to update the Spam numbers list.Â\n\nPrivacy\n\nWhy do you need access to my contacts?\n\nUpon signing up for Hiya, you agree to share your contacts, but we keep all contact data private and donât sell it to third parties or use it to market to your contacts. Because weâre not awful human beings. More information can be found here.\n\nIs giving you access to my contact list still necessary?\n\nFor full functionality, yes. We use it for the smart dialer, to autocomplete suggestions, to whitelist spam functionality, for sharing functionality and for adding to block list functionality. With that said, you donât have to grant contacts permission, but the app will have some limited operation.\n\nDo you have access to my call logs on the iPhone?\n\nWe do not have access to call logs on the iPhone.\n\nHow do you keep contact information private if you use Facebook?\n\nFacebook is used only for login, itâs optional, and nothing is shared with Facebook. Facebook AccountKit is used for phone verification. It does not require a Facebook account, it only verifies the phone number.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nHiya is still not working correctly.Â What is one thing I can try after I try have tried everything else? (The Fail Safe)\n\nThe fail-safe: Consider the fail-safe the app version of calling IT Support and them asking if you restarted your computer.\n\nHowever, itâs important to note that when you uninstall the app, you will lose the numbers in your blocklist. With that said, use this as a last resort if you have an extensive blocklist. (âSave Blocklistâ functionality is a popular request and we are looking into it for future updates).\n\nDisable Hiya in Settings\n\nForce-quit Settings\n\nUninstall Hiya\n\nRestart your device\n\nReinstall Hiya\n\nI have been waiting for the activation code but have yet to receive it. What gives?\n\nWe use Facebook Account Kit for our SMS code verification. Unfortunately, we have no control over whether it works or not.Â With that said, we want it to work as much as you do. Here are a few tips that may help:\n\nTry the fail-safe (noted at the top of the article).\n\nMake sure you have âUnited States (+1)â selected (assuming your phone is, indeed, a U.S. number)\n\nOnly use numbers, donât start with 1 or +1\n\nEnsure your device is subscribed to a texting plan and can receive short-code messages. This one sounds obvious, but weâve had a few instances where users (and even one of our own developers!) had short-code text messages auto-disabled through their carrier. If you arenât receiving activation codes, it is worth a call to your carrier to ensure youâre supported.\n\nWhy am I not seeing âHiyaâ in Settings>Phone>Call Blocking & Identification?\n\nFirst, our latest update on iOS has experienced issues with enabling and/or updating. We have been in communication with Apple and this is a known bug. Apple offered a workaround that seems to work (and it doesnât require an uninstall of Hiya which causes you to lose your blocklist). So, if you are experiencing issues after updating to the latest version, please try this:\n\nWait more than one hour after Hiya gets into a bad state. Reboot the phone, then try to enable Hiya again and it should correct itself.\n\nIf this doesn't work then try the fail-safe at the beginning of the FAQ.Â\n\nHow do you uninstall Hiya?\n\nTo remove Hiya from your iPhone:\n\nOpen the app and tap \"Protect\" at the bottom.\n\nTap the \"Enable Call Protection\" slider so that Call Protection is disabled. This will remove the \"Suspected Spam\", \"Scam or Fraud\", and \"Blacklisted\" contacts that the app uses for Spam/Scam identification.\n\nExit the app and long-press the app icon.\n\nAn \"x\" will appear in one corner. Tap the \"x\" to completely uninstall.\n\nI've uninstalled Hiya but why do calls still seem to be getting blocked?\n\nIf you are still having issues after uninstalling Hiya you might have to reinstall the app and then try these steps:Â Â\n\nDisable Hiya in the iPhone Settings (Settings->Phone->Call Blocking & Identification)\n\nForce-quit Settings\n\nUninstall Hiya\n\nRestart your device\n\nThe Hiya widget doesnât appear as a choice on Notifications.\n\nIf youâve already tried the fail-safe (see above), letâs give this a whirl instead: Pull down the notification center by swiping down from the top of the screen. Swipe right to bring up the widgets page, scroll to the bottom. Tap the circular âeditâ button, and tap the â+â button next to Hiya.\n\nHelp\n\nHow can I give feedback?\n\nWe'd love to hear from you.

Also Serves as a makeshift caller ID where there wasn’t one available beforehand on legitimate business numbers from in and out of State. Works best as long as you KEEP APP OPEN and REFRESH THE DATABASE. Also, submit info on the spam numbers you as a user encounter, which I assume is how the “database” stays current. We are the keepers and informed participants of the content. We are the victims and must report the wrongdoings. Else the numbers won’t be known to this system. Cons- This app has a hard time catching spam calls with local area code prefix. After listening to a recent episode of the “Reply All” podcast on the subject: Why spam calls on cellphones appear as local numbers even if the local area where you travel changes? It is because these numbers are very appealing to intended victims and therefore appealing for spam software. You, The intended recipient is much more likely to answer a local call than one out of state, just the act of answering means the spam bot now knows your number is an active phone, you will see an increase in calls from local spam numbers. Happy Birthday Frankenstein! The thing you should do? Don’t decline them, don’t answer them.

On iOS, it’s absolutely worthless.\n\nI previously used a competing product that was terrific, but for some reason my current carrier isn’t compatible with too many of these solutions, so I had to purchase a subscription to Hiya instead.\n\nDespite having all settings exactly as required, and even after deactivating and reactivating, the app literally does nothing. It will allow every phone call through, known or unknown, unless you manually enter into the block list, so every unwanted call is going to ring your phone at least the first time.\n\nSecondly, don’t expect the call lookup to give you any information, which is comical because it’s the main point of the app. It almost always comes up as “Unknown Caller” and serves up no information. I almost always have to resort to doing a Google search to investigate the number myself.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, it doesn’t block unknown calls (and yes, I have the phone’s “Silence Unknown Calls” setting on, and all toggles on for Hiya to screen and block calls. It’s not user error), and 99% of the time it can’t identify the caller when using the lookup feature. So tell me, what exactly did I purchase an annual subscription for?\n\nAs I write this, the last update by the developers was four months ago. Doesn’t really instill confidence that there’s any attention given to this app.\n\nI know this review is harsh, but that’s how ineffective and frustrating the app is. Do not waste your money!",

I’ve asked support three times and each time I only get a canned response saying they unblocked the single number I was referencing. Here’s the problem. The number is for Uber. Uber uses a number exchange so when drivers and riders communicate their personal numbers aren’t shared. When Hiya blocks one of these numbers, drivers and customers can’t communicate. So the one number they unblocked is fine but there are many many more numbers they use for the exchange so having to contact support with each number they block is very inefficient and I have better things to do. And also, it’s too late, the call was already blocked. In the third email with Hiya support I said that if there isn’t a way for me to whitelist numbers I would have to request a refund. They didn’t care, just send me instructions on how to get a refund.",

Those days are gone one we were only looking in the city where we live now it’s all over the World. Technology is changing every day every second and yes every minute! Are you going to get every time you’re phone rings information as who is calling? ( good luck on that thought) why because the people who created the words Spam and Fraud are changing their numbers every day every second and yes every minute. The Developers of this app are working hard to make this app the best they can to meet the technology changes that are taking place as I write this and I hope you read. How do I know the Developers are working hard look at the number of updates that are being made! So download this app today now will you be sorry? I don’t think so will you get who is calling information all the time ( good luck ) , these great Developers are working hard to some day soon do that for you and myself. Too the Developers thanks for a 5 star app with a great unique design! I Tip my Hat 🎩 for all of the Hard Work you’ve done over all the years to create a Unique Outstanding Design App! “ Thank’s “",

At this point though they are the top of my list to avoid. Essential call blocking features for which users pay, such as blocking numbers that start with a particular string, can no longer be activated unless you also use their extremely invasive third-party call screener function. No, there is no direct connection between the features. They just want access to your calls.  The call screener nag screen also pops up on a regular basis when trying to block numbers individually. I have no intention of letting anyone be funneled through a third-party redirect. I own an iPhone which offers the security that is needed. I’m not giving it up so that Hiya can screen and manage all of my calls and have direct access to that data in the process.

Unfortunately, it has been a huge disappointment. Despite its claims, the app barely blocks any unwanted calls. In fact, I’ve noticed no significant reduction in the number of spam calls I’m receiving. The app’s interface is clunky and not user-friendly. It’s difficult to navigate and offers very few customization options to better tailor the blocking features to my needs. Worse yet, legitimate calls are occasionally blocked while spam calls still get through. This defeats the entire purpose of the app! I’ve tried adjusting the settings multiple times, but nothing seems to improve its performance. It’s incredibly frustrating to be expected to pay for a service that doesn’t work as advertised.

Spam call blockers just don’t work well on iPhone. For most to work properly now, the calls have to go to their service first, compared against a database and stir/shaken protocol and then sent to your phone. For those complaining about their voicemail being broken, it’s because your phone is forwarding out to this service. Search disable call forwarding codes for your mobile carrier to get your VM back. Spam really needs to be blocked at the switch level with your carrier and is the whole point of stir/shaken.  Check to see if your carrier has a spam tool for your phone and use that.

Also Serves as a makeshift caller ID where there wasn’t one available beforehand on legitimate business numbers from in and out of State. Works best as long as you KEEP APP OPEN and REFRESH THE DATABASE. Also, submit info on the spam numbers you as a user encounter, which I assume is how the “database” stays current. We are the keepers and informed participants of the content. We are the victims and must report the wrongdoings. Else the numbers won’t be known to this system. Cons- This app has a hard time catching spam calls with local area code prefix. After listening to a recent episode of the “Reply All” podcast on the subject: Why spam calls on cellphones appear as local numbers even if the local area where you travel changes? It is because these numbers are very appealing to intended victims and therefore appealing for spam software. You, The intended recipient is much more likely to answer a local call than one out of state, just the act of answering means the spam bot now knows your number is an active phone, you will see an increase in calls from local spam numbers. Happy Birthday Frankenstein! The thing you should do? Don’t decline them, don’t answer them.

      "# Completely Useless App, 1 stars [(TheOptiMystic1, Apple App Store, 2024-04-18)](https://apple/11174828518)\nIt’s hard to fathom how this company stays in business with such a poor app. It must be because it’s used as the default call ID/blocker on Samsung phones. On iOS, it’s absolutely worthless.\n\nI previously used a competing product that was terrific, but for some reason my current carrier isn’t compatible with too many of these solutions, so I had to purchase a subscription to Hiya instead.\n\nDespite having all settings exactly as required, and even after deactivating and reactivating, the app literally does nothing. It will allow every phone call through, known or unknown, unless you manually enter into the block list, so every unwanted call is going to ring your phone at least the first time.\n\nSecondly, don’t expect the call lookup to give you any information, which is comical because it’s the main point of the app. It almost always comes up as “Unknown Caller” and serves up no information. I almost always have to resort to doing a Google search to investigate the number myself.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, it doesn’t block unknown calls (and yes, I have the phone’s “Silence Unknown Calls” setting on, and all toggles on for Hiya to screen and block calls. It’s not user error), and 99% of the time it can’t identify the caller when using the lookup feature. So tell me, what exactly did I purchase an annual subscription for?\n\nAs I write this, the last update by the developers was four months ago. Doesn’t really instill confidence that there’s any attention given to this app.\n\nI know this review is harsh, but that’s how ineffective and frustrating the app is. Do not waste your money!",

      "# Horrible support/customer service, 1 stars [(iluvtofumt, Apple App Store, 2024-01-09)](https://apple/10803695506)\nApparently there is no way to prevent a number Hiya has decided should be blocked from being blocked for yourself, aka whitelist. I’ve asked support three times and each time I only get a canned response saying they unblocked the single number I was referencing. Here’s the problem. The number is for Uber. Uber uses a number exchange so when drivers and riders communicate their personal numbers aren’t shared. When Hiya blocks one of these numbers, drivers and customers can’t communicate. So the one number they unblocked is fine but there are many many more numbers they use for the exchange so having to contact support with each number they block is very inefficient and I have better things to do. And also, it’s too late, the call was already blocked. In the third email with Hiya support I said that if there isn’t a way for me to whitelist numbers I would have to request a refund. They didn’t care, just send me instructions on how to get a refund.",

ChiaoGoo are my favorites hands down. They have sharp points that I like for lace. I haven't had too much trouble with the joins or with yarn catching. I did have one cable come out but I think it was my fault. It was a hot day and I tugged on them when the needle was stuck under something. (I tend to have a project in my car at all times so the heat got to it.) HiyaHiya are nice as well. Some people have had problems with the case because the needles aren't super secure. The join is nice but my yarn catches on part of the cable near the join. There is a little bump there on some of them. KnitPicks are affordable and pretty decent. They were my first set. I still use them frequently. The join comes undone if you don't use the key to tighten it. Don't think I have had too much trouble with them. The points are the dullest out of the three sets.

I have opinions but these are just my preferences. \n\nI have heard that Knit Picks doesn't have all that great quality, but I haven't bought many needles from there. I guess they recently moved production/sourcing and it screwed some stuff up? Anyway, that's 3rd hand info for you. \n\nMy personal favorites are HiyaHiyas, followed by chiaogoo, followed by addi. And here's why:\n\n**addi** \n\n* well known for their brass needles, which smell funny to some people and have a more \"sticky\" feel than other metals\n* most flexible cords, which annoys me because the cord is EVERYWHERE OMG\n* most expensive (last I checked)\n* I have heard the joins on the interchangeables are excellent but I haven't used them myself\n* moderate sharpness\n\n**HiyaHiya**\n\n* HiyaHiya sharps are the sharpest - sharper than addi lace or chiaogoo lace (I think there is one brand that has sharper needles but I can't remember what it is)\n* Buying both sets is more expensive, but you get a wider range of sizes (US2-15 vs ... US4-10.5? I think?) \n* You can pick one or the other. Personally I use smaller yarn weights more so I got US2-8. \n* moderate flexibility cords\n* joins are good. I do have to rescrew mine relatively often\n* the smoothest needles ever (I think they're hallow stainless steel)\n\n**Chaiogoo**\n\n* I think these are brushed stainless? So they're heavier and more textured than the HiyaHiyas\n* the cord is designed to prevent kinking (yeah, I've kinked one though) so it's pretty stiff. Good for some things, not so good for magic loop\n* pretty sharp, close second to the HiyaHiyas\n* Can't speak to joins because I haven't used the interchangeables\n* I think these are the cheapest of the 3\n\nIf you haven't tried these, I highly encourage you to try the ones you are thinking of. I think needle choice is such a personal preference and you really won't know until you try. :)\n\n### Comment ID cx7iug7 with +2 score by [(BinChicken, Reddit, 2015-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx7iug7/) (in reply to ID cx79fhi):\nJust to expand on your point, I got the small set of hiya hiyas, and the larger sizes I picked up in the knitpicks metal needles.\r\rThis is because I find bulky yarn does not have as much trouble getting past things like joins.\n\n### Comment ID cx863j3 with +2 score by [(Celt42, Reddit, 2015-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx863j3/) (in reply to ID cx79fhi):\nLove the break down, thanks!\n\n## Comment ID cx792c9 with +3 score by [(arcticfawx, Reddit, 2015-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx792c9/) (in reply to ID 3tl1e8):\nI've never tried Hiya Hiya, but I have knitpicks and ChiaoGoo small set. Waiting a while to get the large set as well. I like the ChiaoGoos a LOT more than my knitpicks set. They're buttery smooth to knit with, nothing falls apart, the cables are so flexible they're awesome for magic looping. My knitpicks were constantly coming apart, the needles fell out of their sockets, the joins were snaggy, they needles unscrewed from the cables in the middle of projects and the cables were stiff as a rod with tons of memory. It was nearly impossible to do magic loop on my knitpicks without giant ladders because the stiffness in the cables kept wanting to push everything apart. I never use my knitpicks set anymore since getting the Chiaogoos, except on the rare occasion I need needle sizes larger than 5mm, since I don't have the large Chiaogoo set yet. I kinda wanna get rid of them completely but haven't gotten around to selling them yet. \n\nOn the other hand, knitpicks customer service is excellent, and they'll replace anything if you call them about it. But at this point about 70% of the needle tips I've gotten from them have been replaced or glued back together. It's not worth the effort. Though that's only the wood tips. The metal ones are fine, but issues with the cables and joins still apply.\n\n## Comment ID cx75ga2 with +2 score by [(emma1961, Reddit, 2015-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx75ga2/) (in reply to ID 3tl1e8):\nI have complete sets of both Hiya Hiya and ChiaoGoo.

Hands down, the TWIST Red Cables of the ChiaoGoo, beat out the Hiya Hiya cables. They're much, much more substantial and therefore lay nice and flat. The Hiya Hiya cables are very thin, like fishing line, and they are always in my way. The only thing about the Hiya Hiya cables that I like are that they swivel where the ChiaoGoo cables do not.\n\nThat being said, if I had only used the Hiya Hiya set I would have been perfectly happy with them.

Addis are great but very pricey and only metal I do love their sock rockets tough. Knit picks is pretty low quality and every circular needle I have gotten from them has broken within 6 months and they wouldn't replace it for me.

That last bit is brilliant.\n* I wouldn't give my ChiaoGoo up for anything and have a pretty complete set/multiples of the fixed red lace circulars.  \n* You can purchase the set of ChiaoGoo in two needle lengths; 4 inch or 5 inch. I use the 5 and wish I would have purchased the 4's.\n\nAddi\n\n* The addi case annoys the piss out of me due to not having a zipper on the pouch and the cables falling out of that open pouch. It's the little things...  However, I like how thin the case is.\n* I find it insulting that addi didn't include end stoppers in the set particularly considering how expensive the set is.  Talk about being cheap asshats.\n* For me, I cannot easily see where I need to line up the addi's to make the connection due to less than stellar eyesight.  \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't purchase something that has two different materials comprising the needle (birch/metal) owing to wood expanding and contracting.

For as good as the sculpt gets, the paint is often spotty. They'll also skip out on obvious accessories like an atomic breath piece, which is annoying, as they absolutely have atomic breath effects pieces. They just need to make one that's pink/red.\n\nThat's how it was with the Minus One figure. Great sculpt, but mine had fucked up eyes, badly painted teeth and didn't come with a blue atomic breath piece like numerous other Godzilla figures that came before. The Minus One figure also ran for well over $100.\n\n### Comment ID laszxgk with +1 score by [(a-stupid-cat, Reddit, 2024-06-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GODZILLA/comments/1ccv3nu/between_hiya_toys_and_sh_monsterarts_evolved/laszxgk/) (in reply to ID l180xy3):\nYk I hate how ppl aren't realising the fact that for the uk hiya are going up to 100+ with shipping 😒\n\n## Comment ID l17wdl8 with +127 score by [(donotpluh, Reddit, 2024-04-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GODZILLA/comments/1ccv3nu/between_hiya_toys_and_sh_monsterarts_evolved/l17wdl8/) (in reply to ID 1ccv3nu):\nThe gut on Hiyas is very sucked in, SHMA has a better gut.

SH is MUCH more faithful to the movie than Hiya is.

I have released two solo dnb albums and am currently working on my third. I've been a Drum and Bass MC for well over 10 years, and live and breath this music.\n\n\n\nA bit about me:\n\n- I have across multiple genres including Techno, Funk, Hiphop, House Music, Dubstep and Breakbeats, but Drum and Bass is my first love.  Currently there are around 120+ tracks with my vocals on :)\n\n- In 2015, I won the Best Newcomer MC in the Drum and Bass Arena Awards.\n\n- I've been nominated every year since then, for Best MC, in the same awards and in 2019, I came second.\n\n- I've won the Czech and Slovak Drum and Bass Awards for nine years in a row as Best International MC.\n\n- Recently, I won Best MC National at the German Drum and Bass Awards and also Best Track National.\n\n- Fun fact: I am a Gemini who has never ever been on a roller coaster in my life because I'm totally scared of heights.\n\n- I have a small dog called Billy. He's a monster but I love him to piece\n\nCareer highlights:\n\n- I've worked across 39 countries worldwide.\n\n- Outside of dnb i´ve performed with artists like Kruder & Dorfmeister, Stereotyp and Felix de Housecat and many more\n\n- Opened a concert for Missy Elliott in Kuala Lumper, Malaysia\n\n- Toured China with Don Roobles of Kitachi (Iration Steppers)\n\n\n\n  \nHere are some links to my latest work and social media:\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/coppaworld](https://www.instagram.com/coppaworld)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/artist/0rkBb19hZKPCrXugecfokF?si=k9dmsm7ORn2xjrEFsHsFEQ](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0rkBb19hZKPCrXugecfokF?si=k9dmsm7ORn2xjrEFsHsFEQ)\n\n[https://soundcloud.com/coppakid](https://soundcloud.com/coppakid)\n\n [www.mccoppa.co.uk](http://www.mccoppa.co.uk)\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/marvin.c.hay](https://www.facebook.com/marvin.c.hay)\n\n\n\nI’ll be here live answering your questions for the next few hours, so please feel free to ask me anything!\n\n  \nBigups!\n\nCop!\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID leptjfl with +11 score by [(lefuniname, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/leptjfl/) (in reply to ID 1eb34l9):\nHey Marvin, thanks for doing this!!

For me writing is writing - it all starts with a main theme,  then i´ll find an different way to approach it. Like for example  \"Pocket full of Drops\" (with Telekinesis) - the whole theme of that is using the metaphor of dealing out music & dubs like \"slinging dope\".  \n\n\"If you´re a bass (free-base rock/crack) fiend, we got the D (Diesel - old-school slang for heroin but also power fuel) we supplying it\" \n\n- i just enjoy writing and just literally having fun with it and creating imagery which goes with the feel of the music is what i consider the real art of it. I like to reference things that i like and inject my personality into the lyrics. Different style of dnb obviously bring out different sides of me.\n\nIn my other music or my dnb personal projects i´m more involved with the production process as far as the composition, topline melodies and arrangements of the ideas (mainly with my music partner Tommy) before they get the producer, but for dnb as far as external collabs go - most of the time i receive already full solid track ideas - so there's no need for it.

I've always found interesting your style, cause to me it's like you are doing hip hop on a drum and bass beat, that's why i also think your tracks are so likeable and easy to connect with.\n\n### Comment ID leqtvir with +4 score by [(coppaworld174, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/leqtvir/) (in reply to ID lepsv59):\nHeya!

I've tried writing something and actually also recorded a bit in a small studio, but it's so hard to write original lyrics (I know that might be obvious but I never really experienced it myself haha). How do you go about writing yours? Do you write to (partially) existing tracks, or do you like to write in advance and then try to fit it to a track you're collaborating on? I'm super curious about your general approaches!\n\n## Comment ID leq3zyx with +3 score by [(Bluecutlery, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/leq3zyx/) (in reply to ID 1eb34l9):\nWhich artist did you had the most fun working with?\nAlso, congratulations on your career!

Some are good and sparing with their words, some are incessant and to be honest, shit. I recently left Brixton Bass just after midnight because of them. \n\nI’ve just got tickets to drum and bass classics in late August and they’ve got a separate arena with no MC’s at all “let the music speak for itself” is the tag line. \n\nI go back to a time before MC’s, so what do you think can be done for those who simply aren’t too keen on them, because sometimes it’s impossible to get away from them.\n\n### Comment ID ler781a with +4 score by [(coppaworld174, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/ler781a/) (in reply to ID leq4s3h):\nHey mate, well.... i FEEL you so much on this point. As an MC myself its really quite difficult because i totally understand what you talking about. Its not like i have ears immune to this kind of thing myself, its just a shame that it reflects bad on the actual artform as a whole and those of us who take it seriously. Obviously i wasnt there or can comment on your recent experience but it seems like its not an uncommon one.\n\nObviously your never going to please EVERY member of a crowd as an MC but i do feel that if you are holding the microphone you should have enough self-awareness to understand when you are getting in the way or stopping people from enjoying the music. For me personally, i am there because i enjoy the music aswell and therefore i want to hear the music and enjoy the music with everyone else there, thats the whole point no? I know what my voice sounds like and as much as i enjoy hearing it, thats not the focus of why i´m there. I can chat in the shower to myself all day if i wanted lol but the thing is... and this might give you a little insight, is sometimes hearing yourself and holding the microphone can be a kind of a \"power trip\" for people, its sad to say but its kinda true... but with great power, comes great responsibility - but that part is not read in the handbook for mc-ing.\n\nAlso its alot easier to pass as an \"MC\" then it is as DJ because the audible clanging would stop the party instantly but vocal clanging seems to be more tolerated but at the expense of the ravers/punters. I think its not an MC-issue per say but a promoter issue for letting people on the microphone who might not have the professionalism, composure and experience yet to step up to that responsibility. And in the end, the ravers/punters lose out and also the MC´s who work  really hard and respect the craft also because it perpetuates MC-Bashing culture and turns regular people into people that \"dont like MCs\"\n\nI feel ya mate, and only wish there was a license for this - that you had to apply for to pass the MC-Test.  I think selecting nights with certain MCs who are in control of the microphone or picking nights that dont have MC´s or MC free-rooms is the easiest solution in the time being.\n\n#### Comment ID lericwo with +2 score by [(blimeyitsme, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/lericwo/) (in reply to ID ler781a):\nHey Marvin \n\nThanks for a great, lengthy and very well considered reply, I really appreciate it. \n\nI’ve not heard you at a club (yet) but just reading your understanding from my point of view (and of course your own experience), I reckon you’d be an MC I’d enjoy. \n\nIt may not have sounded like it, but I do actually enjoy some and I didn’t mean to shit on your talent at all. I like the idea of passing an MC test! To be honest, a shit DJ who can’t mix won’t get booked again, so why isn’t it the same for MC’s? that would just leave the very good ones!\n\nI suppose it can be quite cliquey and most certainly a power trip for some, as if they’re the main attraction. \n\nIt’s a contentious issue in this sub, MC’s are typically the marmite of dnb, you either love it or hate it, but this reply was about as good as it gets. \n\nThanks again and all the best from a 50 year old DJ who’s been up and coming for the last 34 years. 👍🏻\n\n### Comment ID leqqgg9 with +3 score by [(OccasionllyAsleep, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/leqqgg9/) (in reply to ID leq4s3h):\nI take it in strides like any other show or genre.

Hiya is simply another option. They make great collectibles that are cheaper and have a great range of motion but they aren’t flawless either (though I do feel like the majority of their figs have a good amount of “bang for your $”). They’re both options, no one is making anyone choose one over the other and you’re free to just say “no I don’t want that” to any of the products either offer.\n\n#### Comment ID lfk0hpj with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SHMonsterArts/comments/1efalj0/as_of_2024_do_you_prefer_hiyas_godzilla_line_or/lfk0hpj/) (in reply to ID lfjxxgj):\nSummed my feelings up perfectly dude\n\n## Comment ID lfjv7jl with +8 score by [(Dovahfry, Reddit, 2024-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SHMonsterArts/comments/1efalj0/as_of_2024_do_you_prefer_hiyas_godzilla_line_or/lfjv7jl/) (in reply to ID 1efalj0):\nHiya.

It’s nice to have a $50 Evolved Goji that will probably not articulate quite as well as the $140 SHMA one but will look nice and have solid articulation on the shelf.\n \nI’m in full agreement about the prices, each new Godzilla now is anywhere from $95-150 and the older ones were in the $70-$80. Tack on things like Shimo being $240 and I feel like there’s good reason to step back and evaluate the product more \n\n- Shimo, Skar King, Evolved Godzilla total are going to cost over $450. \n- In contrast G’19, Mothra/Rodan and Ghidorah was about $350. (You could even throw in the Burning Godzilla for $90 and it’d still be slightly cheaper the new figures coming out and that’s not taking into account Suko and Kong too).\n\n## Comment ID lfl0ec6 with +2 score by [(Ryanjames22808, Reddit, 2024-07-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SHMonsterArts/comments/1efalj0/as_of_2024_do_you_prefer_hiyas_godzilla_line_or/lfl0ec6/) (in reply to ID 1efalj0):\nHiya for some things, like Ghidorah, GMK or Shimo, and SHMA for a lot of others.\n\n## Comment ID lfm746q with +2 score by [(Due-Committee-1860, Reddit, 2024-07-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SHMonsterArts/comments/1efalj0/as_of_2024_do_you_prefer_hiyas_godzilla_line_or/lfm746q/) (in reply to ID 1efalj0):\nBoth.

I do like how crazy articulated SHMAs figured are. Makes jt a joy to pose and play. I don't like how they purchased locked Kong's much needed accessories though. Pretty shitty practice. \n\nSHMA Godzilla and Shimo's figured came out pretty weird in sculpt and paint unlike HIYAS. I'm also confused why SHMA  used the same brown for their mothra when in the movies, mothra looked like a completely different color.\n\nHonestly, the Hiya line for the price and size of their figures is really good. Their paint and scuplt is pretty accurate to the series. I'm kind of worried for their Kong figures because the Kong pictures didn't include the power fist, but his axe. Not sure where the Power Fist is.\n\nI really want BOTH sides of the figures to come out great and make a purchase from the final release. Stopped and canceled all my pre-orders from both sides from now on.\n\n## Comment ID lfjwthp with +1 score by [(Godzilla_3000, Reddit, 2024-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SHMonsterArts/comments/1efalj0/as_of_2024_do_you_prefer_hiyas_godzilla_line_or/lfjwthp/) (in reply to ID 1efalj0):\nMix of both. Personally I prefer the SHMA Godzilla(which everyone seems to hate on) The hiya Kong looks EXTREMELY promising and the most accurate Kong yet so that’s a must have for me The hiya Shimo is a coin toss and I think it really just comes down to which design you prefer. For me I went with the hiya Shimo because it’s like $160 cheaper lmao. The 2019 Hiya Mothra also for me is pretty definitive \nThere’s only one suko thus far.\nAlso only one skar king so far\n\n## Comment ID lfjxb3u with +1 score by [(More_Eagle_9718, Reddit, 2024-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SHMonsterArts/comments/1efalj0/as_of_2024_do_you_prefer_hiyas_godzilla_line_or/lfjxb3u/) (in reply to ID 1efalj0):\nBoth.

SHMA articulation might be better, but the sculpts, paint apps, and overall screen accuracy are extremely disappointing for the price. Hiya figures have their flaws, but I think even with limited articulation, you get much more bang for your buck if you're interested in the MV designs.\n\n\nSHMA's quality trends as of late are extremely disappointing, but their articulation is generally quite solid, and they've done a *lot* more with classic toho Godzilla than Hiya does. Even with Hiya diving into Toho designs, it'll be a *long* time before they start to seriously compete with SHMA for sheer variety and depth of choices in the Toho Godzilla department. \n\n\nThat said, a lot of good SHMA figures are hard to come by these days, and this might give Hiya an edge, simply because their \"more affordable\" trend is significantly more of a plus when the SHMA option is a resale that's 350+ dollars on average (number pulled from nothing) so if Hiya does speed up their diversification of the Godzilla line, they're going to give SHMA a real run for their money. But honestly, that's definitely a good thing. \nCompetition is what keeps companies from getting complacent, and for awhile SHMA was the only real option for high quality articulated Godzilla figures. Hiya as competition might force SHMA to get more stringent with the quality of the products they're offering, for the MV and otherwise. Godzilla Evolved looks like they're improving upon the major errors in the 2014/2019 mold, which is a very good start. Both lines existing means the consumer wins. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while not Godzilla, SHMA has the edge in a Monster Hunter figure line. I'm not huge on most of the monsters they've done so far (the monsters themselves, not the figures) but I am going to preorder Rajang the *second* I can. Really hoping for a Legiana or Bazelgeuse down the line.\n\n## Comment ID lfl5blz with +1 score by [(Runminndor, Reddit, 2024-07-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SHMonsterArts/comments/1efalj0/as_of_2024_do_you_prefer_hiyas_godzilla_line_or/lfl5blz/) (in reply to ID 1efalj0):\nSHMA. Objectively Hiya’s the better line, I just don’t care for it in the slightest. I kinda forced myself to like it and bought most of the figures, but as soon as I got my Ghidorah I realized I wasn’t the tiniest bit excited for it and it’s been the same with every other figure. Currently in the process of selling my entire Hiya collection. \n\nOn the other hand, no matter how inaccurate, every single SHMA I’ve ever bought since the line started in 2011 has been like Christmas to me, so I’m just going to stick to it and be happy.\n\n## Comment ID lfl6lar with +1 score by [(xDivineJustice, Reddit, 2024-07-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SHMonsterArts/comments/1efalj0/as_of_2024_do_you_prefer_hiyas_godzilla_line_or/lfl6lar/) (in reply to ID 1efalj0):\nI like both so far, but a bit disappointed to see hiya releasing so many godzilla figures.

I do not have this \"Hiya\" app or default phone whatever, but do have \"Caller ID ...\" turned on. The only downside of this latter option (which is provided in the phone) is that it is bringing up a large popup page headed \"PRIVATE NUMBER\" after I make a call to a number that is NOT on my contacts list. Once anticipated one can deal with that. The first poster does seem to have a problem that seems to be unrelated to the \"Caller ID\" option - ie calls they are expecting are being permanently blocked by their phone. That may well have nothing to do with \"Caller ID ...\" and it doesn't sound like they are using the \"Hiya\" app. The way to fix that would be to turn off turn off \"Caller ID...\" and see what happens.

Just the other day, Big Bad toy store had an ad on the page I was reading for the Mechagodzilla 2 model kit 1/400 scale. That figure is $104.99 USD, but despite the fact they're showing pictures of it with paint, it isn't actually painted at all. In addition to $104.99, you'll then have to spend money to paint it, and depending on how accurate you want to make it look, that's going to involve getting some quality paints. We're not talking about the paints used in a high school art class either.

They're slicker than most mid-range metal needles I've owned. His coworkers who knit tried to convince him to return them and get metal needles because wooden needles are seen as somehow less 'mature' in the craft, and I've been knitting for like 35 years. I totally understand their stance. People who knit as a serious hobby tend to prefer metal needles. But the thing is I already own multiple fixed cord needles in the sizes I *need* slick metal needles for (like for TAAT socks) and many in assorted other sizes, if I ever want them. I like to knit outside, though, and metal needles hurt my hands after about 30 seconds, so slick wood is *the dream*.\n\nIt's such a personal thing. I mean, I would have enjoyed a nice metal set, too, but the wood ones are just so perfect for my needs and preferences, and I'm sure someone else would have been disappointed to get the same set.\n\n## Comment ID iwv6upb with +23 score by [(ClevelandMinerals, Reddit, 2022-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/yyna79/i_think_hiya_hiya_needles_are_the_best_better/iwv6upb/) (in reply to ID yyna79):\nIt's weird to be combative about something that is entirely personal preference. I personally love ChiaoGoos, wasn't a fan of Addi interchangeables due to how the cables join. But your experience with a specific needle is going to be affected by both what you're knitting and how you hold the needles when you knit. I think anyone shopping around for a pricey interchangeable set should consider buying a single pair of interchangeable needles from that brand (whatever size they use the most) and a long cable and use it for a while to see how they like it before buying a $150+ complete set. Either you don't like the needles and you save $150+ minus whatever you spent on the single pair, or you love them and you end up getting the entire set and have an extra pair of your most frequently used size.\n\n### Comment ID iwvay56 with +2 score by [(LanesJanes1, Reddit, 2022-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/yyna79/i_think_hiya_hiya_needles_are_the_best_better/iwvay56/) (in reply to ID iwv6upb):\nYes, I’m glad I did just that!

Point is, if Hiya Hiya makes them, you can get them there. Even 000000 size fixed circs.\n\nThe website isn't exactly mobile friendly, so is best viewed on a computer.\n\nAlso, I'm Team Hiya Hiya all the way.",

Now in its 38th year, Entrepreneur Of The Year is the preeminent competitive business award for audacious leaders who disrupt markets, revolutionize sectors and have a transformational impact on lives. Over the past four decades, the program has recognized the daring entrepreneurs with big ideas and bold actions that reshape our world.\n\nDarren Litt was one of a core group of entrepreneurs chosen by an independent panel of judges based on his demonstration of building long-term value through entrepreneurial spirit, purpose, growth, and impact, among other contributions and attributes.\n\nHiya's inception arose from the realization of the nutritional inadequacy and excessive sugar content in children's vitamins, potentially exacerbating health issues instead of alleviating them. As a mission-driven brand that's been self-funded since inception, Hiya was founded with a vision to provide healthier alternatives for kids and has since become the leading children's brand helping shape the next wave of children's health.\n\n\"This recognition from EY fuels our mission at Hiya to redefine children's wellness. We're not just making vitamins for kids — we're building a legacy of wellness, helping one child at a time to develop good habits and a positive association with health,\" said Darren Litt.\n\nEntrepreneur Of The Year honors many different types of business leaders for their ingenuity, courage and entrepreneurial spirit. The program celebrates original founders who bootstrapped their business from inception or who raised outside capital to grow their company; transformational CEOs who infused innovation into an existing organization to catapult its trajectory; and multigenerational family business leaders who reimagined a legacy business model to fortify it for the future.\n\nAward winners will be announced on June 13, 2024 during a special celebration at The Beverly Hills Hotel and will become lifetime members of an esteemed community of Entrepreneur Of The Year alumni from around the world. The winners will then be considered by the National judges for the Entrepreneur Of The Year National Awards, which will be presented in November at the annual Strategic Growth Forum ®, one of the nation's most prestigious gatherings of high-growth, market-leading companies.\n\nSponsors\n\nFounded and produced by Ernst & Young LLP, the Entrepreneur Of The Year Awards include presenting sponsors PNC Bank, Cresa, Marsh USA, SAP and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. In Greater Los Angeles, sponsors also include Edelman, Cooley, Los Angeles Business Journal, Vaco, ADP, Big Picture, and Rutan & Tucker.\n\nAbout Entrepreneur Of The Year®\n\nFounded in 1986, Entrepreneur Of The Year® has celebrated more than 11,000 ambitious visionaries who are leading successful, dynamic businesses in the US, and it has since expanded to nearly 80 countries and territories globally.\n\nThe US program consists of 17 regional programs whose panels of independent judges select the regional award winners every June. Those winners compete for national recognition at the Strategic Growth Forum® in November where National finalists and award winners are announced. The overall National winner represents the US at the World Entrepreneur Of The Year® competition.

This is projected to benefit businesses by providing their customers with greater peace of mind when receiving their calls and making it more likely someone will answer.\n\nThe news follows extensive investment from Virgin Media O2 in recent years to keep its customers safe from fraud, with the new tools and services due to run alongside existing fraud protection measures. This includes spam text AI-powered technology which has prevented more than 89 million fraudulent texts from reaching customers in 2023 alone.\n\nMurray Mackenzie, Director of Fraud at Virgin Media O2, said: “In the fight against fraud, we’re committed to rolling out the latest technology to help keep our customers safe.\n\n“From AI tools to help us block fraudulent calls, to services that help identify callers before a customer has even picked up the phone, our extensive partnership with Hiya will see us continue to improve on our existing measures and give customers’ additional protection from spam and fraudsters.”\n\nKush Parikh, President of Hiya, said “We are proud to provide our spam and fraud solution and branded calling service to Virgin Media O2, a company known for its exceptional service throughout the UK.\n\n“Carriers around the world are wrestling with how to prevent phone spam and scams, and protect the reputation of business customers. Hiya is doing its part to restore confidence in voice calling by aligning with leaders like Virgin Media O2.”\n\nPhone spam and fraud are persistent challenges for telco carriers worldwide. In the UK alone, 28% of unknown calls were spam according to the latest Hiya study – and nearly 10% of those were fraud calls. With scammers constantly evolving their methods and looking for new ways to gain personal information from customers, Virgin Media O2 is urging all mobile customers to report suspicious texts for free by forwarding them on to 7726.\n\nBy forwarding on scam texts, customers can protect themselves and others from fraud.
