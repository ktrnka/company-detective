      "# [Imposter Apps and How to Spot Them: Chronicles of App Store Imitators by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/imposter-apps/)\nImitation is the highest form of flattery. If that’s true, we at Hiya should be thrilled to see so many apps in the App Store claiming to be Hiya. Somehow it doesn’t quite ring true though.\n\nImposter apps are looking for one thing: money. As such, they “build” fake apps, load them onto the App Store, charge money for them and then sit back and reap the financial benefits until Apple shuts them down. Then, they rinse and repeat with another app.\n\nIn Hiya’s case, we now have scammers scamming an anti-scam company. Consider the gauntlet thrown.\n\nHow can you tell if an app in the app store is an imposter?\n\nDeveloper name: Hiya’s developer name is Hiya. Simple! It should be recognizable or a name that you can easily look up and verify. Note: the developer name will not always match the app name (for example, Hiya also owns the Mr. Number app), but, with a little research, you should be able to confirm if the developer is indeed legitimate.\n\nWebsite: In the app store, we link toHiya’s Web Site and ourHiya Caller ID and Block Support page. Imposter apps will have links as well, however, they don’t function or will lead to a page that has nothing to do with the app.\n\nCost: Did you hear from a friend that Hiya is free? They were right! If you go into the App store and all of a sudden, you have to pay for a “free” app, you’re looking at an imposter.\n\nReviews: One of the most important tools at our fingertips. As fake apps are just that – fake, they will not function as they are supposed to. After paying $1.99 for an app and it doesn’t work, you can bet reviews will come in and they will not be pleasant. Take a look at the reviews. Sure, Hiya doesn’t get 5 star reviews all the time (nobody’s perfect…not yet, at least), but, we have a wide range of positive reviews from many users. Imposters will have only a few reviews and they will not be positive.\n\nImposters will receive a few, very bad reviews",
      "# [Amazon Scam Calls to Watch For | Hiya by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/amazon-scam)\nAmazon is in an enviable position of being a top retailer and having global brand recognition. The flip side of that, however, is that its notoriety makes it a prime target for scammers. Fraudsters making random robocalls have a good chance of reaching someone who has an Amazon account.\n\nAmazon has operations on five continents and has dedicated websites in 13 countries. It’s no wonder that Amazon phone scams are common in many countries, including\n\n#1 phone scam in Canada\n\n#1 phone scam in the UK\n\n#2 phone scam in the US\n\nHow do Amazon scam calls work?\n\nNo matter how hard you try to keep your phone number private, scammers have several tactics to obtain contact information. There are data brokers that find personal information online and sell it to third parties. Scammers can purchase this information and then contact you about your Amazon account. Scammers can also obtain any personal information that was leaked during a data breach.\n\nOnce they have your phone number, scammers make a call from an unknown number or one that was spoofed to appear as if it were coming from Amazon. The scammer then claims to be part of the Amazon customer support team calling about an issue with an order or a notice of a security breach. The scammer then attempts to gain your personal information (like your Amazon account username and password or credit card information) by claiming that this information is necessary to resolve the issue.\n\nSamples of Amazon scam calls\n\nBelow are transcripts of actual Amazon scam calls. These are from the Hiya honeypot: a collection of Hiya-owned phone numbers used to capture the content of scam and nuisance calls. Here is the wording of the three most common Amazon scam calls observed by Hiya:\n\n“Hello. This is Amazon. This call is to authorize a payment of $999. We would like to inform you that there is an order placed for an Apple iPhone 11 Pro using your Amazon account. If you do not authorize this order press 1, or press 2 to authorize this order.\n\n“This is a confirmation call from Amazon regarding your purchase of iPhone 13 Pro Max and Apple Airpods, totaling $1499. But we have found some suspicious activities in your account while processing the payment. So in order to cancel your order, kindly press 1 to speak with the Amazon fraud department.”\n\n“Hello. Amazon Express notice. A courier delivered twice and no one has signed for it. For details, please press 1.”\n\nEach call has a common element: the robocall asks the recipient to press a number, which will connect with a phony Amazon representative. Instead of wasting time making live calls, the scammers start with a robocall, and if the recipient falls for the scam and presses a number, a live operator will attempt to get the victim to reveal their Amazon account information or credit card number.\n\nReports from Hiya users\n\nIn addition to the honeypot, Hiya also receives user reports from consumers using Hiya Protect via their carrier, device manufacturer, or the Hiya mobile app. Here’s a sampling of the Amazon scam calls users are reporting:\n\n“Multiple calls from multiple numbers to convince me to let them help with a fraudulent purchase on Amazon.”\n\n“Claims to be from Amazon.

      "# [What is enterprise branded call? Display a branded caller ID | Hiya by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/branded-call)\nWe’ve all had the experience of seeing an unknown number pop up on our phones. Without thinking, we answer the call, only to hear, “[car warranty scam beginning.]” The frustration we feel from this spam call, coupled with the frequency we experience it, leaves us with a sour taste in our mouths. It’s no wonder 87% of consumers believe unidentified calls may be fraudulent. And for call centers that regularly make outbound calls, this has detrimental effects.\n\nThat’s why branding your calls with your business name is so important. With a Branded Call, the caller ID displays a caller’s company name, location, logo, and other identifiable information before the call even starts. Instead of seeing “unknown caller” and worrying about the nuisance of a potential spam call, a Branded Call allows customers to identify and trust the source of a call immediately.\n\nLet your customers know you're calling. With branded caller ID, display your company name, logo, and location to engage with more people, faster.\n\nBenefits of enterprise branded caller ID\n\nAlthough agencies like the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are trying to use their resources to stop the exponential increase in spam calls, they’re simply aren't given enough to respond to the rapidly evolving scam tactics deployed by scammers.\n\nTrust\n\nWhen consumers cannot trust the calls coming from your business, it starts affecting their perception of your brand. Imagine you are waiting for a call from your food delivery service on the status of your order. Time goes by and you haven’t received an update. You’d be pretty frustrated and your confidence in the company would plummet. While the delivery driver could have been calling you all along, you didn’t answer the calls because you didn’t know who was calling. As more and more customers stop answering their phones for unidentified calls, this damaged reputation can snowball into massive losses as customers choose other delivery services.\n\nSecurity and spam\n\nFraudsters are always ready and willing to impersonate well-known companies—and with people more connected to their phones than ever before, telecom scams are their method of choice. But with Hiya’s Branded Call, by providing your company name and logo, you can assure your customers that your call is legitimate. Hiya also offers Secure Call, an additional feature that pre-authenticates outbound calls before they are made, securing your branded caller identity, and protecting your customers from falling victim to fraudsters using your numbers.\n\nBranding\n\nThe customer's experience of the call will influence whether they have a positive or negative perception of your business. A Branded Call will help create a visual experience that draws the customer in and increases their positive association with the business and its call center. Word of mouth is a powerful marketing vehicle, so it is important to remember that positive interactions often lead customers to spread the word.\n\nIncrease answer rates\n\nImagine you get two calls—one says “unknown number” and the other says a company’s name. Which one are you going to answer? Call centers with a branded caller ID through Hiya report an average 80% increase in answer rates. Customers pick up the phone when they know who’s calling.\n\nWhat are the risks of not having an enterprise branded caller ID?\n\nAt this point, you should be quite familiar with the fact that branded caller ID can improve the efforts of your contact center dramatically. But what are the risks associated with not having a Branded Call? Consider the following:\n\nUnanswered calls\n\nWhat do most people do when they encounter an unknown number? They ignore the call. According to Hiya's State of the Call survey, 84% of consumers think an unidentified call is fraudulent. As a result of being unable to communicate essential information to your customers, your company’s bottom line will suffer.\n\nThe challenges of unidentified calls\n\nIn today's digital age, trust is paramount. When a call comes in without a clear indicator of who is calling, many consumers hesitate to answer, fearing potential scams or unwanted solicitations. Imagine eagerly awaiting an update on your food delivery order. Minutes turn into hours, and there's no word. Your frustration mounts, and your trust in the service wanes. Unbeknownst to you, the delivery driver may have been trying to reach you, but their calls went unanswered because there was no clear indication of who was on the other end. This scenario is becoming increasingly common as more individuals opt to ignore unidentified calls. As this trend continues, businesses face the risk of eroding customer trust and loyalty, potentially leading to significant losses as customers turn to competitors with clearer communication channels.\n\nHow Hiya can help\n\nWant to know how you can brand your business name on your outbound calls? calling an iPhone or Android? Getting Hiya Connect can help you change your caller ID to accurately identify and increase your answer rates. The Branded Call feature helps call centers display their company name, logo, and reason for calling. This will help your business contact the right individuals while building trust in your brand. Hiya’s Voice Performance Platform also gives you the ability to:\n\nTrack the impact of Branded Call over time\n\nMonitor your caller reputation health\n\nUnderstand why calls have been blocked or reported\n\nSecure calls and prevent number hijacking",
      "# [You’re A Mean One Mr. Grinch…Or Should We Say Holiday Scammers by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/holiday-scammers/)\nThanksgiving may be over, but just because you put away your “Thanksgiving pants,” doesn’t mean you shouldn’t prepare yourself for the next wave of holiday madness coming your way.\n\nFrom online shopping to searching for holiday jobs to giving to the less fortunate, our good deeds are like a double-edged sword. Scammers have caught on to our holiday habits and are using it to their advantage but unfortunately, it’s also to our demise. Here are a few scams you should keep an eye out for this holiday season that will help you gain back the upper hand:\n\nCharity Scam\n\nThe holidays are a time for giving, and as we plan to make generous donations, you may have already been victim to a number of requests from a variety of “organizations”. Unfortunately, charity scams have seen a 50% increase from November 2015 to November 2016.\n\nScammers are disguising themselves as “charities” to take advantage of you while you’re in the giving spirit. They will either request personal or financial information (which legitimate charities will never ask for) and most likely a small percentage (if you’re lucky) or none of your donation will go to the cause you are trying to help.\n\nGift Card Scam\n\nWe’re all familiar with gift card scammers tricking us into paying past due bills and overdue taxes with gift cards but during the holiday season, it’s all about tricking us into selling them our unwanted gift cards.\n\nThere are a variety of gift card scams out there and because of them, it’s not a surprise that from October 2015 to October 2016, there was a 58.19% increase and from January 2016 to October 2016 alone there was a 43.21% increase in the scam.\n\nGift cards are a simple yet easy gift, but we don’t always get the ones we ask for. Just about everything sells online including gift cards and this holiday season we’re likely to do just that. When making an offer on a gift card, scammers will demand the seller confirm the balance on the card by calling the merchant on a three-way call. While the seller enters the gift card number, the scammer records the touch-tone numbers entered to intercept the gift card number. Then, scammers will use the gift card without paying for it. Make sure to sell unwanted gift cards to reputable gift card resellers, or to a gift card exchange kiosk (i.e. Coinstar.)\n\nHoliday (Vacation) Scam\n\nWho can resist a vacation, but even more who can resist a “FREE” holiday vacation! It’s apparent that the word “FREE’ has been getting the best of us since these types of scams have gone up 69% from October 2015 to November 2016.\n\nA majority of vacation scams start with a phone call promising an unbelievable prize from a raffle or survey you may (or may not) have entered. As you rack your brain wondering what you may have unknowingly entered, you can’t help but feel that what they’re offering is too good to be true. If you’re getting that gut feeling, it probably is.\n\nPackage Delivery Scam\n\nIt’s always a wonderful surprise to find a package from Uncle Bob or Aunt Sue on your front porch during the holiday season, but don’t let the flood of gifts catch you off-guard when you get a text telling you that you have a package “waiting” for you.\n\nThese types of “packages” can come as a notice claiming you’ve won a prize, or a SMiShing link that you’ve received a package and all you have to do is “click the link” to find the status of its delivery. Don’t fall for it! Scammers are taking advantage of your gift-receiving vulnerability to get you to click on links that will download software to help them steal your personal and financial information.\n\nOnline Shopping Scam\n\nWe know that despite it being the time of giving, gifts can add up. So, when we can find a killer deal on something, we tend to seize the opportunity. However, when these opportunities seem too good to be true, know that they usually are.\n\nFrom social media to Craigslist, scammers are reeling in victims with deals they know shoppers won’t want to miss. They request payment and before the buyer can receive what they’ve paid for, the seller has already run with their money before victims realize they’ve been had. Do your due diligence and shop from accredited stores or make sure you know who you’re wheeling and dealing with before you hand over your whole holiday budget.\n\nHoliday Employment\n\nUnfortunately, this doesn’t only happen during the holiday season but all year round. However, during the holidays, a number of us are looking to make some extra cash with seasonal jobs. Due to popular demand, scammers are creating fake job listings to swipe personal and financial information from unknowing job candidates by requesting social security numbers and bank account numbers and conducting fake background checks.\n\nIf you ever receive these types of calls or feel you’re being victimized, it’s best to hang up the phone and do some research on the organization. Call the organization directly to make sure that it is a legitimate business. If the call was a scam, report the call to the FCC.\n\nHappy Holidays!",

      "# [What Are Sales Optimization Best Practices? by Alicia Marie Beatty](https://blog.hiya.com/sales-optimizations)\nOptimizing your call performance strategy can be a difficult, arduous task--made even worse if your team is constantly hiring and training new agents. Many managers find it difficult to focus their team’s efforts on activities that will maximize revenue. We’ve been there, and we’re here to help.\n\nThe word “optimization” is used so frequently in business conversations that the meaning often becomes masked by other definitions. Managers will frequently, mistakenly use “optimize” in lieu of other, more appropriate words like “growth” or “high performance.” And though these definitions may appear to be quite similar, using the words interchangeably will cause your sales team to miss out on golden opportunities.\n\nIn this article, we’re taking a minute to break down what sales optimization really is, why it’s critical for your success, and how you can begin implementing best practices today.\n\nWhat Is Sales Optimization?\n\nSales optimization is the process of analyzing and improving sales performance to achieve maximum revenue. Good managers evaluate the performance of sales teams and provide training to help agents develop skills that lead to wins.\n\nOptimizations are important in every industry, but it especially applies to the work done in contact centers. Because outbound calls are so repetitive, it can be easy for agents to develop bad habits through lack of focus. Optimization occurs when agents consistently use best practices to increase the likelihood of closing sales.\n\nOptimization Best Practices\n\nThere are many things that contact centers can do to maximize their sales revenue. Here are three ways to take your optimization strategy to the next level:\n\n1. Set Long Term Goals\n\nSince sales optimization is all about choosing the most efficient path to success, it’s important to start by visualizing your end goal. Set goals based on yearly revenue and sales, and keep those goals top of mind.\n\nA common misstep: call center teams tend to focus more on short-term goals than they do on long-term goals. Weekly, monthly, and quarterly goals are only useful if they provide a clear path to achieving long-term business goals. Because sales optimization is all about adjusting performance over time, you’ll need to be careful to not get so focused on hitting this quarter’s numbers that you forget about the bigger picture.\n\nSome managers find it difficult to create lasting, measurable goals, instead opting for short-term goals that are easy to achieve. This is understandable, since long-term goals are usually more high-level and difficult to track. Although they are typically more difficult to track, long-term goals can be, and usually are, more closely aligned with the call center’s mission statement than short-term goals. However, it is impossible to optimize for long-term goals without having a way to measure performance metrics. In short, make sure your goals are tied to a measurable KPI that can be tracked. An example of this might be, ”increase sales by 13% by the end of Q3.” This example hits the sweet spot between setting a goal for your team without being prescriptive or restrictive about the ways in which they go about achieving that goal—creating focus, and allowing for innovation to discover new methods of optimization along the way.\n\n2. Use A Voice Performance Platform for Sales Optimization\n\nSales optimization platforms (like Hiya’s Voice Performance Platform) provide all the tools you need to successfully implement software sales strategies. With these tools for data collection and analysis (and, on a premiere software like Hiya, customized insights) you can stay on track for reaching your long-term goals. Good platforms will also include solutions to common problems call centers face, such as security, reputation management, audience analysis data, and more.\n\nWhen deciding on a voice performance platform, pay attention to what’s offered; is the software cloud-based? Does it contain fraud filters? And is the data self-service, on demand, and accessible 24/7? Sales optimization platforms that include these features can be far more valuable than standard, static caller registries, as they go beyond the basic information provided by your dialer. Choose a platform that will best meet your company’s needs and help you achieve your long-term goals.\n\n3. Make Data-Driven Decisions\n\nThe best sales processes always include an emphasis on tracking and analyzing data which allows managers to make decisions based on actionable insights. While everything up to this point has been important, this step is where the most tangible, significant results happen.\n\nMaking business decisions that are rooted in data does two things to your sales performance. First, it gives you an imperial metric to guide you in an industry that is all too frequently subjective. You can’t fool numbers. Second, it gives you a way to measure the efficacy of your initiatives. Many sales optimization platforms, such as Hiya’s Voice Performance Platform, will allow you to identify lead quality -- an invaluable resource for your agents. While it’s not an exact science, if your decisions aren’t backed by data and tracked in an organized manner, you’ll have no idea if an initiative is making an impact.\n\nAs you track your team’s performance, pay attention to trends in data. For example, if you notice a sudden drop in answer rates, it may be a sign that an imposter is spoofing your calls. No amount of training your agents will improve that metric. Once you’ve discovered a spoofing problem, you can take action by securing your calls and giving customers the confidence to answer. Fortunately, many sales optimization platforms, including Hiya Connect, can help notify you when problems like this arise and can solve them before they have a chance to negatively impact performance.\n\nUsing Hiya Connect for Sales Optimization\n\nHiya Connect, a Voice Performance Platform, is the industry-leading platform for performance analytics. Its intuitive dashboard integrates all of your metrics in one platform, allowing for a clear, comprehensive view of your performance. Hiya also provides data-driven insights to give you actionable steps to improve call performance. These are a few examples of how Hiya Connect can help you reach your optimization goals.\n\nCall centers may come across a sudden decline in answer rates, which may signify an imposter attempting to spoof your calls. Customers become conditioned to not pick up the phone anymore after they’ve received spam calls from numbers that look similar to your business numbers. Hiya Connect protects against spam labels and secures network connections, so you will never have to face this issue again.\n\nWhat if your answer rates were never high to begin with? Hiya Connect provides call centers with branded calls, which display your company name, logo, and a custom, informative reason for calling. Answer rates increase significantly when the prospect knows the identity of the caller.",
      "# [Evolution of Phones and its Affect on Society by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/telephone-transformation/)\nThe smartphones we possess today have come a long way from the first rendition of the telephone back in 1876 when Alexander Graham Bell invented and patented the first short-range phone. But like people, phones have evolved throughout history to cater to our lifestyles and needs.\n\nHere’s a look at how telephones have transformed over the years…\n\nShort-Range Phone: Despite a number of individuals from around the world who’ve contributed to the invention of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell was the first to receive a patent for his short-range phone in 1876. Testing out the phone in his Boston laboratory, he rang his assistant Thomas Watson, and become well known-for saying, “Mr. Watson, come here – I want to see you.”\n\nCandlestick Phone: The candlestick phone became popular in the 1890s through the 1930s. Separated by two pieces, it featured a mouth piece (transmitter) mounted at the top of the stand, and a receiver (ear phone) that the user would hold to their ear during a call.\n\nRotary Phone: Pushing out the candlestick phone, the rotary phone came about in the 1930s when manufacturers began to combine the mouth piece and receiver of the candlestick phones into a single unit. When dialing a rotary phone, what originally started as lugs, but evolved into holes, one would then rotate the dial to the number that they wanted and then would release the dial.\n\nTouch-Dial Phone: On November 18, 1963, the Bell System unveiled the first electronic touch-dial phone system with touch-tone dialing. It would become the worldwide standard for telecommunication signaling. Using audible tones for each of the digits on the push-button keypad, specific frequencies were designated to each row and column. The tones helped the switching center determine which key was pressed.\n\nFirst Mobile Phone: On April 3, 1973, Motorola researcher and executive, Martin Cooper, made the first mobile telephone from handheld subscriber equipment. Weighing in at 2.4 lbs and measuring at 228.6 x 127 x 44.4mm, Cooper was said to have called a rival telecommunications company and let them know he was talking to them on a mobile phone. The prototype was able to give a caller 30 minutes of talk-time and took about 10 hours to charge.\n\nCordless Phone: Cordless phones became a hot commodity in the 1980s but was originally invented by a female Jazz musician named Teri Pall in 1965. The handset cord of the telephone was replaced with a radio link. However, Teri’s invention would not hit the consumer market until a decade and a half later.\n\nFirst Portable Phone: Even though Martin Cooper invented the first mobile phone, the first portable mobile phone was the MicroTAC which was introduced in 1989 as “an innovative new “flip” design”, where the “mouthpiece” folded over the keypad, although the “mouthpiece” was actually located in the base of the phone, along with the ringer. Up until its release, most cellular phones were installed as car phones due to the inability to fit them into a jacket pocket.\n\nNokia: Through the mid-90s and into the early 2000s, Nokia mobile phones catered to consumers, with interchangeable faceplates, customizable designs, the first WAP browser, internal antenna, T9 Text messaging, and eventually an LCD screen and internet connectivity.\n\nFirst Camera Phone (Sanyo SCP-5300): Possessing the first camera phone, the U.S. finally adopted the Japanese trend in November 2002. The clunky clamshell design could capture photos at 640×480 pixels and had a basic flash, white balance control, self-timer, digital zoom, and various filters (sepia, black and white, and negative colors.)\n\nCrack-Berry (BlackBerry): Blackberry made waves with their popular RIM communication device in 2003 which possessed a phone, PDA, and e-mail system all in one hand-held phone. The term crack-berry came about when users constantly checked their e-mail and sent short messages through their device.\n\nSleek Mobile Design (Motorola Razr): First developed in 2003, the Motorola Razr hit it big when it was marketed as a fashion phone due to its sleek and thin profile. Over its four-year run, they sold over a 130 million phones and were named the best-selling clamshell phone in history.\n\nSmartphones: Dating back as far as 1997, it wasn’t until Japan became the first mobile market to popularize the smartphone in 1999. As BlackBerry, Palm, HTC, Windows Mobile, Samsung, Nokia, and Motorola made a name for themselves in the early 2000s, their smartphones had the capability to email, fax, and search the internet. As the smartphone craze escalated, cell phone manufacturers tested a number of functionalities that would help them capitalize on the new trend. From sliding, flipping, rotating, vertical, and even multiple keyboards, touchscreen smartphones made their way into the market which also introduce the stylus. However, the functionality these phones offered were still targeting more business users versus consumers.\n\nCue in iPhone 3G. The first of its kind, the original iPhone was the first touch-screen smartphone that was unveiled in June 2007. Apple’s take on the smartphone combines “multimedia functions with the same email and Web browsing features as all other smartphones previously had. It had a large color display with a capacitive digitizer, and its user interface was finally finger-friendly. And unlike phones before it, the iPhone had only one button on its face – the Home button – and three around its edges, two for volume up/down and one for power/standby.” reports the “The Evolution of the Smartphone” from PocketNow.\n\nToday, iPhone has paved the way for a number of other cell phone manufacturers to create their own version of the smartphones we love today. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg on how phones have evolved over history, but it’s apparent that as phones change, engineers will cater to the needs of consumers. What do you think the evolution of phones will come up with next?\n\nKeep on top of all the trends in Voice with Hiya's State of the Call report below.",

      "# [iPhone FAQ](https://www.hiya.com/faq-ios)\nGetting Started\n\nWhere can I learn more about using Hiya?\n\nYou can learn more at our Help Center here.\n\nHiya is not working correctly. What is one thing I can try before I try anything else? (The Fail Safe)\n\nThe fail-safe: Consider the fail-safe the app version of calling IT Support and them asking if you restarted your computer.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that when you uninstall the app, you will lose the numbers in your blocklist. With that said, use this as a last resort if you have an extensive blocklist. (“Save Blocklist” functionality is a popular request and we are looking into it for future updates).\n\nDisable Hiya in Settings\n\nForce-quit Settings\n\nUninstall Hiya\n\nRestart your device\n\nReinstall Hiya\n\nThe enable Hiya option in the iPhone settings is not working. What do I do?\n\nFirst, our latest update on iOS has experienced issues with enabling and/or updating. We have been in communication with Apple and this is a known bug. Apple offered a workaround that seems to work (and it doesn’t require an uninstall of Hiya which causes you to lose your blocklist). So, if you are experiencing issues after updating to the latest version, please try this:\n\nWait at least one hour after Hiya gets into a bad state. Reboot the phone, then try to enable Hiya again and it should correct itself.\n\nIf this doesn't work then try the fail-safe just above.\n\nMy Caller ID name is wrong. How do I change it?\n\nIf you notice your number is incorrectly labeled as spam, or you notice that wrong information is shown or missing from your own number or someone else’s or, if you would like to remove your information from our services altogether, please click here and we can help you.\n\nHow do I report inaccurate or offensive comments?\n\nIf your number has inaccurate or offensive comments please follow the steps on this linked form and we can look into getting them removed for you.\n\nI have been waiting for the activation code but have yet to receive it. What gives?\n\nWe use Facebook Account Kit for our SMS code verification. Unfortunately, we have no control over whether it works or not. With that said, we want it to work as much as you do. Here are a few tips that may help:\n\nTry the fail-safe (noted at the top of the article).\n\nMake sure you have “United States (+1)” selected (assuming your phone is, indeed, a U.S. number)\n\nOnly use numbers, don’t start with 1 or +1\n\nEnsure your device is subscribed to a texting plan and can receive short-code messages. This one sounds obvious, but we’ve had a few instances where users (and even one of our own developers!) had short-code text messages auto-disabled through their carrier. If you aren’t receiving activation codes, it is worth a call to your carrier to ensure you’re supported.\n\nCall Blocking\n\nHow can I block Spoofed Calls / Neighbor Scam (calls that show as my area code and prefix) on Hiya?\n\nThere is a way to block spoofed calls in the iPhone app. In the Hiya app, tap on options in the bottom right, then scroll down to the Spoofed Calls / Neighbor Scam option and choose block. You can also choose to alert instead of block.\n\nPlease be aware that the block option will block all calls with your area code and your prefix. Even those in your contact list. This is something that we will fix in the next release in the next couple of weeks. In the meantime, the alert option is probably your best bet.\n\nWhy is the iPhone app blocking a contact from calling me?\n\nDo you have a contact in your iPhone that is blocked from calling you and you're not sure why? You might have to change a setting to fix it.\n\nIn the Hiya app, tap on Options in the bottom right, then scroll down to the Spoofed Calls / Neighbor Scam option and choose Alert or Do Nothing. The block option for spoofed calls will block all calls with your area code and your prefix. Even those in your contact list. This is something that we will fix in our next iPhone release. In the meantime, the alert option is probably the best bet.\n\nIs there a way to prevent blocked calls from going to voicemail?\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot prevent blocked calls from going to voicemail. This is a limitation from Apple that prevents us from hanging up on blocked calls. As soon as Apple lifts this limitation, we will eagerly make it available. We want to hang up on them as well.\n\nIs there a way to see calls that have been blocked?\n\nUnfortunately, not. This is another implementation detail from Apple that we can’t work around (we can provide a blocked calls list with Android). We have no idea why we can’t have a “Hey! We’re awesome and here’s a list of calls we’ve blocked for you” section somewhere. The day that changes is the day you’ll see it.\n\nIs there any way to block all unknown caller ID/private callers?\n\nUnfortunately, there’s no way to block all unknown callers, in the app or iPhone itself. We can only block an actual number that is recognized by caller ID. Android has some cool features like block by area code, but at this time, we can’t provide that feature on iPhone.\n\nIn iOS is there a way to import or export the block list after un/reinstalling?\n\nWe don’t have a “save block list” function right now… However, it is a popular request so we are looking into it.\n\nProtection\n\nHow do I use Hiya to look up unknown numbers?\n\nFirst copy the unknown number from your Recents within the Phone application and then open Hiya. Hiya will ask you if you want to identify the number you just copied. Tap “yes” and Hiya will look up the number for you.\n\nWhat are the steps for copying phone numbers?\n\nTo copy a phone number, go to your Recent calls within the iPhone Phone application and tap on the info icon (the “i” with a circle around it) for the number you wish to look up. Once you’re on the contact card, press the caller's number and hold it for a couple seconds. The option to copy the number will appear. Tap “Copy” and the number is ready for you to paste into other apps.\n\nHow do I look up numbers with the widget (iOS 8 and above only)?\n\nFirst install the Hiya widget. To install the widget, pull down the Notification Center. Make sure you are on the “Today” tab. Scroll to the bottom and tap “Edit.” You will be shown a list of apps that have widgets available. Tap on Hiya to add the widget.\n\nNext, copy the number you want to look up from your Recent Call Log. Pull down the Notification Center and scroll to the Hiya widget. The phone number will be automatically identified there.\n\nHow does Hiya identify incoming scam and spam calls?\n\nHiya adds an address book entry containing hundreds of phone numbers for known-to-be spammers and scammers. Because scammers and spammers are constantly changing their phone numbers to avoid detection, we update our entries at least once a day, often more.\n\nWhy does an inbound call not get marked as spam, even if Hiya reports show it as a spam number?\n\nThere are a few things here.\n\n#1) Our database of spammers is gigantic. Unfortunately, we are not able to enter every single spam number in the world into CallKit. We have to be picky and so we choose only the spam numbers that we have the highest confidence in to ID on the incoming call. For the remaining numbers, sometimes you’ll have to manually look them up in the app to see if they are Suspected Spam or not.\n\n#2) When a call comes in, we look up the number to see if it’s spam. Usually, it takes less than one second, but sometimes it simply takes longer and calls can get through.\n\nI have installed the app, but so far no calls have been identified….?\n\nIf calls are not being identified at all when you get them, then something has probably gone wrong. A simple check is to see if any calls are identified in the native phone call log. You should see some Hiya entries in there if it’s working.\n\nIf not, revert to the fail-safe (see above) and then, go back into the app, in the Call Protection tab, click on “Update Now” and give it about a minute to update, then check the call log again.\n\nAre spam numbers updated in the background or do I have to manually launch the app occasionally to update?\n\nIf you enable Hiya (through the phone's Settings> Phone> Call Blocking and Identification), then our spam lists will update in the background. Leading to our next ever-popular question…\n\nI enabled Hiya in the phone's settings, why does the app continually tell me I need to go in and update (by showing a red dot on the app icon)?\n\nAnytime the spam list updates, you will receive a badge notification on the Hiya icon. This is to let you know that it’s working and updating. If you prefer not to see this, you can disable badge icons in your Settings (the spam lists will still continue to update, you just won’t be notified as such).\n\nTo disable badge icons follow these steps: Go into your settings for the iPhone itself. Go to Settings> Notifications> Hiya> and then disable “Badge App Icon.”\n\nWhy do the number of scam and spam calls I am protected from keep changing?\n\nScammers and spammers are constantly changing their phone numbers to avoid being blocked by our app. We update the lists of scammers and spammers at least once a day, as long as the app is active to ensure that you stay protected from unwanted calls. Typically a scammer's number will only be active for 2-5 days before it is shut down by it's own provider. When a number is shutdown and deactivated we take it off of the total blocked list.\n\nWhat is the difference between scam calls, spam calls and blacklisted calls?\n\nScams are calls trying to get you to send them money or are found to be fraud in some other way. Spam calls are calls from telemarketers, bill collectors, solicitors, etc. Spam is not dangerous, but can be very annoying. Blacklisted calls are from numbers that you choose to blacklist because you want them blocked. This is someone such as an ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend or anyone you just don’t want to talk to.\n\nHow do I use the spam check dialer?\n\nGo to the “Call” tab in the app and type in the phone number you want to dial. If no spam is detected, then the call will go through. If the number you are dialing is identified as spam, you will be warned and asked if you want to continue with the call.\n\nDoes the “real-time” notification only work over wifi or 3g?\n\nHiya doesn’t require any network connection; if you can receive a phone call, it works! You will only need a connection to update the Spam numbers list.\n\nPrivacy\n\nWhy do you need access to my contacts?\n\nUpon signing up for Hiya, you agree to share your contacts, but we keep all contact data private and don’t sell it to third parties or use it to market to your contacts. Because we’re not awful human beings. More information can be found here.\n\nIs giving you access to my contact list still necessary?\n\nFor full functionality, yes. We use it for the smart dialer, to autocomplete suggestions, to whitelist spam functionality, for sharing functionality and for adding to block list functionality. With that said, you don’t have to grant contacts permission, but the app will have some limited operation.\n\nDo you have access to my call logs on the iPhone?\n\nWe do not have access to call logs on the iPhone.\n\nHow do you keep contact information private if you use Facebook?\n\nFacebook is used only for login, it’s optional, and nothing is shared with Facebook. Facebook AccountKit is used for phone verification. It does not require a Facebook account, it only verifies the phone number.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nHiya is still not working correctly. What is one thing I can try after I try have tried everything else? (The Fail Safe)\n\nThe fail-safe: Consider the fail-safe the app version of calling IT Support and them asking if you restarted your computer.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that when you uninstall the app, you will lose the numbers in your blocklist. With that said, use this as a last resort if you have an extensive blocklist. (“Save Blocklist” functionality is a popular request and we are looking into it for future updates).\n\nDisable Hiya in Settings\n\nForce-quit Settings\n\nUninstall Hiya\n\nRestart your device\n\nReinstall Hiya\n\nI have been waiting for the activation code but have yet to receive it. What gives?\n\nWe use Facebook Account Kit for our SMS code verification. Unfortunately, we have no control over whether it works or not. With that said, we want it to work as much as you do. Here are a few tips that may help:\n\nTry the fail-safe (noted at the top of the article).\n\nMake sure you have “United States (+1)” selected (assuming your phone is, indeed, a U.S. number)\n\nOnly use numbers, don’t start with 1 or +1\n\nEnsure your device is subscribed to a texting plan and can receive short-code messages. This one sounds obvious, but we’ve had a few instances where users (and even one of our own developers!) had short-code text messages auto-disabled through their carrier. If you aren’t receiving activation codes, it is worth a call to your carrier to ensure you’re supported.\n\nWhy am I not seeing “Hiya” in Settings>Phone>Call Blocking & Identification?\n\nFirst, our latest update on iOS has experienced issues with enabling and/or updating. We have been in communication with Apple and this is a known bug. Apple offered a workaround that seems to work (and it doesn’t require an uninstall of Hiya which causes you to lose your blocklist). So, if you are experiencing issues after updating to the latest version, please try this:\n\nWait more than one hour after Hiya gets into a bad state. Reboot the phone, then try to enable Hiya again and it should correct itself.\n\nIf this doesn't work then try the fail-safe at the beginning of the FAQ.\n\nHow do you uninstall Hiya?\n\nTo remove Hiya from your iPhone:\n\nOpen the app and tap \"Protect\" at the bottom.\n\nTap the \"Enable Call Protection\" slider so that Call Protection is disabled. This will remove the \"Suspected Spam\", \"Scam or Fraud\", and \"Blacklisted\" contacts that the app uses for Spam/Scam identification.\n\nExit the app and long-press the app icon.\n\nAn \"x\" will appear in one corner. Tap the \"x\" to completely uninstall.\n\nI've uninstalled Hiya but why do calls still seem to be getting blocked?\n\nIf you are still having issues after uninstalling Hiya you might have to reinstall the app and then try these steps:\n\nDisable Hiya in the iPhone Settings (Settings->Phone->Call Blocking & Identification)\n\nForce-quit Settings\n\nUninstall Hiya\n\nRestart your device\n\nThe Hiya widget doesn’t appear as a choice on Notifications.\n\nIf you’ve already tried the fail-safe (see above), let’s give this a whirl instead: Pull down the notification center by swiping down from the top of the screen. Swipe right to bring up the widgets page, scroll to the bottom. Tap the circular “edit” button, and tap the “+” button next to Hiya.\n\nHelp\n\nHow can I give feedback?\n\nWe'd love to hear from you. Click here to contact us.\n\nHow do I contact support?",
      "# [Get your questions about Spam answered](https://work.hiya.com/why-spam)\nCommon questions we hear:\n\nWhy is my businesses phone number showing up as spam?\n\nSpam labels are applied by carriers who want to protect you from scam and spam calls.\n\nIf the data shows that your calls are unwanted by your recipients, either through high abandon rates, blocks, or being reported as spam (among other datapoints), your calls are more likely to be delivered with a “spam likely” label. Mobile carriers are constantly monitoring additional datapoints, working to fight the ever evolving scam tactics used by spammers and scammers.\n\nHow can I check if my outbound caller id is showing as spam?\n\nUse a service like Hiya’s Cross Carrier Call Inspection to see how your calls are displayed across carriers and devices. If you are ready to check your numbers, fill out the form below and our team will reach out to get a list of numbers to perform the audit.\n\nSome businesses do use a revolving door of phone numbers, rotating through them to attempt to evade these labels, rather than understanding the call practices that led to this labeling in the first place. If you think your phone numbers are showing up as spam, a call inspection is the first step. Then Hiya can guide you through the next steps in getting your calls delivered with an identity that matches your business.\n\nHow often do people answer calls with a spam identity?\n\nIn short: they don’t. And as nuisance calls increase in frequency, the likelihood of someone answering a spam or unidentified number is plummeting.\n\nEven without a spam label, 87% of consumers think an unidentified number may be fraudulent. And if a consumer receives a call impersonating your business, 73% of consumers struggle to trust that business ever again.\n\nWhy is Hiya different?\n\nWe work with our customers to ensure that they are prepared to get the most out of their voice channel today, and far into the future.\n\nWe also work directly with the carriers to understand the future of best call practices, and ensure our customers are acting on these long term plans for getting their calls answered. Unlike competitors, we know services like number rotation or spam mitigation isn't a long term solution. Having a branded identity on your calls alongside good call practices are the only way to build trust over the voice channel and get your calls answered again.",

      "# [Beyond CATI: Making Real Connections with Voice by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/beyond-cati)\nComputer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) is a technology that saves time and increases response rates for companies that use telephone surveys for marketing research and other interview-based initiatives.\n\nCATI works just as the name implies – a live person uses a computer as an aid in interviews using an automated script. As the interviewer gets a response from the person on the phone, the answers are inputted into the computer to be used as data for analysis and outputs such as statistics, trends, patterns, and other market research.\n\nFor surveys and similar marketing programs, CATI works great and adds significant speed and value to data capture. For instance, when a person answers yes or no to a question, the CATI software will automatically provide the interviewer with the appropriate next question. A “yes” response may result in further questions that dig deeper, while a “no” response may initiate an action to end the survey with a thank you.\n\nThe pitfall: No real human interaction or intelligence added\n\nCATI certainly serves a purpose in market research and accelerates the collection of survey data, but it leaves little room for relationship building. Nor does it facilitate a deeper collection of insights that can only come from an interactive conversation between two live people.\n\nThe humanizing factor in voice calls allows the person initiating the call to:\n\nBuild a real connection. In a free-form conversation, the caller has the immediate opportunity to start building a relationship with the person on the receiving end.\n\n“Hear” emotion. Empathy is something that is only achievable in a free-form voice call, and the ability to hear the emotion of the person called is critical, especially if the person is an unhappy or frustrated customer.\n\nDiscover the unexpected. When there is a precise script to be followed, like in CATI software-driven calls, the caller is unable to change gears when the person being called says something unexpected. In a free-form call, the caller can respond directly and intelligently to provide better customer service.\n\nBeyond the humanizing touch, a voice call can bring, there are many other bottom-line benefits as well, such as increased sales, opportunities for upsells, improved customer loyalty, and best of all, greater revenue generation.\n\nIncreasing the opportunity for real connections\n\nWith the help of a branded call solution like Hiya Connect, callers can start building real connections immediately. Branded calling sets the stage for high-quality humanizing calls because a customer or prospect can see who is calling – and the reason for the call – even before the call is even answered. With this advantage, calls get answered more frequently, often on the first attempt, improving connection rates.\n\nThe personalization of a branded call also helps keep people on the phone longer, with more engagement and better bottom-line results.\n\nStart humanizing your calls today",

On iOS, it’s absolutely worthless.\n\nI previously used a competing product that was terrific, but for some reason my current carrier isn’t compatible with too many of these solutions, so I had to purchase a subscription to Hiya instead.\n\nDespite having all settings exactly as required, and even after deactivating and reactivating, the app literally does nothing. It will allow every phone call through, known or unknown, unless you manually enter into the block list, so every unwanted call is going to ring your phone at least the first time.\n\nSecondly, don’t expect the call lookup to give you any information, which is comical because it’s the main point of the app. It almost always comes up as “Unknown Caller” and serves up no information. I almost always have to resort to doing a Google search to investigate the number myself.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, it doesn’t block unknown calls (and yes, I have the phone’s “Silence Unknown Calls” setting on, and all toggles on for Hiya to screen and block calls. It’s not user error), and 99% of the time it can’t identify the caller when using the lookup feature. So tell me, what exactly did I purchase an annual subscription for?\n\nAs I write this, the last update by the developers was four months ago.

On iOS, it’s absolutely worthless.\n\nI previously used a competing product that was terrific, but for some reason my current carrier isn’t compatible with too many of these solutions, so I had to purchase a subscription to Hiya instead.\n\nDespite having all settings exactly as required, and even after deactivating and reactivating, the app literally does nothing. It will allow every phone call through, known or unknown, unless you manually enter into the block list, so every unwanted call is going to ring your phone at least the first time.\n\nSecondly, don’t expect the call lookup to give you any information, which is comical because it’s the main point of the app. It almost always comes up as “Unknown Caller” and serves up no information. I almost always have to resort to doing a Google search to investigate the number myself.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, it doesn’t block unknown calls (and yes, I have the phone’s “Silence Unknown Calls” setting on, and all toggles on for Hiya to screen and block calls. It’s not user error), and 99% of the time it can’t identify the caller when using the lookup feature. So tell me, what exactly did I purchase an annual subscription for?\n\nAs I write this, the last update by the developers was four months ago. Doesn’t really instill confidence that there’s any attention given to this app.\n\nI know this review is harsh, but that’s how ineffective and frustrating the app is. Do not waste your money!",

I wouldn't  have known if I hadn't gone into \"blocked calls\" on my S23 Ultra to have  a look after receiving a text notif informing me that attempts made to  reach my by my postal service had failed multiple times today.\n\nI  was hoping - like \"Spam Protection\" on my secondary Pixel device (which  was more efficient) - Samsung's spam call service would at least let it  ring with a \"Suspected Spam\" floating message then give me the option  to answer, reject or block instead of autoblocking. As far as memory  services, this is the first time I'm receiving a call from my postal  service so I hadn't done any prior settings to block it to begin with.\n\nI  don't know how it determines what is spam and what isn't. But it would  be scary to think one day somebody might be in a situation where an  emergency scenario at home occurred and Hiya autoblocks all incoming calls from a family member without the user's knowledge.\n\n## Comment ID k4jlbf5 with +4 score by [(I2iSTUDIOS, Reddit, 2023-10-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1763egw/experience_with_hiya_spam_call_protection/k4jlbf5/) (in reply to ID 1763egw):\nChange the settings to what you desire.

They are a glass repair company. Sometimes they have to ring a customer back to schedule a job or quote/confirm things etc. \n\nRecently it seems Hiya (suspected as it seems to be mainly Samsung phones) has blanket marking nearly all my customer's calls as SPAM. Meaning that THEIR clients don't answer their phones and miss appointments or thinks no-one ever calls them back etc, when instead the calls have silently dropped into their spam basket.\n\nThen I found this article:\n\n[https://commsrisk.com/big-us-call-analytics-firms-hiya-and-tns-blasted-for-conflict-of-interest-over-incorrect-spam-labels/](https://commsrisk.com/big-us-call-analytics-firms-hiya-and-tns-blasted-for-conflict-of-interest-over-incorrect-spam-labels/)\n\nHiya were very proud to announce their use of AI here to classify numbers as spam or not: \n\n[https://www.geekwire.com/2021/spam-smackdown-hiya-claims-massive-step-forward-using-ai-against-illegal-phone-calls/](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/spam-smackdown-hiya-claims-massive-step-forward-using-ai-against-illegal-phone-calls/)\n\nSeems Hiya and services like it may be making a big mess, (or doing it on purpose?) then getting businesses to contact them to clear the numbers from being marked as spam. I'm not sure whether they charge to clear legit number from their database but they have paid tiers so maybe it's just to get a point of contact to the business to try to convince them to buy their product. I won't speculate but it seems possible.\n\nIn any case thanks to the tardy way these services operate (and there's a few of them I'm just suspecting Hiya as it seems to be happening mostly on Samsung phones (that use Hiya)), I have a customer losing their customers and costing them money hand over fist.\n\nI believe services such as this CAN be beneficial for sure but when they get to choose who receives phone calls from whom based on AI without any confirmation about the numbers in question it's like holding numbers to hostage?\n\nIn any case. Big headaches for me and my clients and I hope some authority steps in soon to streamline the system and prevent legit numbers from getting blocked as it can literally ruin a business!\n\n### Comment ID l1kxjs1 with +1 score by [(Fresh_computer_smell, Reddit, 2024-04-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1763egw/experience_with_hiya_spam_call_protection/l1kxjs1/) (in reply to ID kubcwsz):\nThis is a great article.

That isn't totally fair, everyone has it, the west is just sort of in denial about it.\n\nLet me share a prophetic narration with the word in it to clarify why it is nothing to do with meekness: \"God certainly +verb form of hayaa+ to turn away a slaves hands when one reaches out their palm and asks Him for something\"\n\nWelcome to /r/Arabs with a cultural exchange from SEA too if you wish, I don't know what a good subreddit for the region there would be.\n\n#### Comment ID hfcrnsy with +2 score by [(nzgrl74, Reddit, 2021-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/q0khl4/is_the_fililpino_concept_of_hiya_meaning_shame/hfcrnsy/) (in reply to ID hfa42oj):\nSomewhat confused by this - is it not “shame” - as in , “for shame” or “have you no shame?” Is this not all related to “save face”?

I have released two solo dnb albums and am currently working on my third. I've been a Drum and Bass MC for well over 10 years, and live and breath this music.\n\n\n\nA bit about me:\n\n- I have across multiple genres including Techno, Funk, Hiphop, House Music, Dubstep and Breakbeats, but Drum and Bass is my first love.  Currently there are around 120+ tracks with my vocals on :)\n\n- In 2015, I won the Best Newcomer MC in the Drum and Bass Arena Awards.\n\n- I've been nominated every year since then, for Best MC, in the same awards and in 2019, I came second.\n\n- I've won the Czech and Slovak Drum and Bass Awards for nine years in a row as Best International MC.\n\n- Recently, I won Best MC National at the German Drum and Bass Awards and also Best Track National.\n\n- Fun fact: I am a Gemini who has never ever been on a roller coaster in my life because I'm totally scared of heights.\n\n- I have a small dog called Billy. He's a monster but I love him to piece\n\nCareer highlights:\n\n- I've worked across 39 countries worldwide.\n\n- Outside of dnb i´ve performed with artists like Kruder & Dorfmeister, Stereotyp and Felix de Housecat and many more\n\n- Opened a concert for Missy Elliott in Kuala Lumper, Malaysia\n\n- Toured China with Don Roobles of Kitachi (Iration Steppers)\n\n\n\n  \nHere are some links to my latest work and social media:\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/coppaworld](https://www.instagram.com/coppaworld)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/artist/0rkBb19hZKPCrXugecfokF?si=k9dmsm7ORn2xjrEFsHsFEQ](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0rkBb19hZKPCrXugecfokF?si=k9dmsm7ORn2xjrEFsHsFEQ)\n\n[https://soundcloud.com/coppakid](https://soundcloud.com/coppakid)\n\n [www.mccoppa.co.uk](http://www.mccoppa.co.uk)\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/marvin.c.hay](https://www.facebook.com/marvin.c.hay)\n\n\n\nI’ll be here live answering your questions for the next few hours, so please feel free to ask me anything!\n\n  \nBigups!\n\nCop!\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID leptjfl with +12 score by [(lefuniname, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/leptjfl/) (in reply to ID 1eb34l9):\nHey Marvin, thanks for doing this!!

For me writing is writing - it all starts with a main theme,  then i´ll find an different way to approach it. Like for example  \"Pocket full of Drops\" (with Telekinesis) - the whole theme of that is using the metaphor of dealing out music & dubs like \"slinging dope\".  \n\n\"If you´re a bass (free-base rock/crack) fiend, we got the D (Diesel - old-school slang for heroin but also power fuel) we supplying it\" \n\n- i just enjoy writing and just literally having fun with it and creating imagery which goes with the feel of the music is what i consider the real art of it. I like to reference things that i like and inject my personality into the lyrics. Different style of dnb obviously bring out different sides of me.\n\nIn my other music or my dnb personal projects i´m more involved with the production process as far as the composition, topline melodies and arrangements of the ideas (mainly with my music partner Tommy) before they get the producer, but for dnb as far as external collabs go - most of the time i receive already full solid track ideas - so there's no need for it.

I've tried writing something and actually also recorded a bit in a small studio, but it's so hard to write original lyrics (I know that might be obvious but I never really experienced it myself haha).

Some are good and sparing with their words, some are incessant and to be honest, shit. I recently left Brixton Bass just after midnight because of them. \n\nI’ve just got tickets to drum and bass classics in late August and they’ve got a separate arena with no MC’s at all “let the music speak for itself” is the tag line. \n\nI go back to a time before MC’s, so what do you think can be done for those who simply aren’t too keen on them, because sometimes it’s impossible to get away from them.\n\n### Comment ID ler781a with +5 score by [(coppaworld174, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/ler781a/) (in reply to ID leq4s3h):\nHey mate, well.... i FEEL you so much on this point. As an MC myself its really quite difficult because i totally understand what you talking about. Its not like i have ears immune to this kind of thing myself, its just a shame that it reflects bad on the actual artform as a whole and those of us who take it seriously. Obviously i wasnt there or can comment on your recent experience but it seems like its not an uncommon one.\n\nObviously your never going to please EVERY member of a crowd as an MC but i do feel that if you are holding the microphone you should have enough self-awareness to understand when you are getting in the way or stopping people from enjoying the music. For me personally, i am there because i enjoy the music aswell and therefore i want to hear the music and enjoy the music with everyone else there, thats the whole point no? I know what my voice sounds like and as much as i enjoy hearing it, thats not the focus of why i´m there. I can chat in the shower to myself all day if i wanted lol but the thing is... and this might give you a little insight, is sometimes hearing yourself and holding the microphone can be a kind of a \"power trip\" for people, its sad to say but its kinda true... but with great power, comes great responsibility - but that part is not read in the handbook for mc-ing.\n\nAlso its alot easier to pass as an \"MC\" then it is as DJ because the audible clanging would stop the party instantly but vocal clanging seems to be more tolerated but at the expense of the ravers/punters. I think its not an MC-issue per say but a promoter issue for letting people on the microphone who might not have the professionalism, composure and experience yet to step up to that responsibility. And in the end, the ravers/punters lose out and also the MC´s who work  really hard and respect the craft also because it perpetuates MC-Bashing culture and turns regular people into people that \"dont like MCs\"\n\nI feel ya mate, and only wish there was a license for this - that you had to apply for to pass the MC-Test.  I think selecting nights with certain MCs who are in control of the microphone or picking nights that dont have MC´s or MC free-rooms is the easiest solution in the time being.\n\n#### Comment ID lericwo with +2 score by [(blimeyitsme, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/lericwo/) (in reply to ID ler781a):\nHey Marvin \n\nThanks for a great, lengthy and very well considered reply, I really appreciate it. \n\nI’ve not heard you at a club (yet) but just reading your understanding from my point of view (and of course your own experience), I reckon you’d be an MC I’d enjoy. \n\nIt may not have sounded like it, but I do actually enjoy some and I didn’t mean to shit on your talent at all. I like the idea of passing an MC test! To be honest, a shit DJ who can’t mix won’t get booked again, so why isn’t it the same for MC’s? that would just leave the very good ones!\n\nI suppose it can be quite cliquey and most certainly a power trip for some, as if they’re the main attraction. \n\nIt’s a contentious issue in this sub, MC’s are typically the marmite of dnb, you either love it or hate it, but this reply was about as good as it gets. \n\nThanks again and all the best from a 50 year old DJ who’s been up and coming for the last 34 years. 👍🏻\n\n### Comment ID leqqgg9 with +3 score by [(OccasionllyAsleep, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/leqqgg9/) (in reply to ID leq4s3h):\nI take it in strides like any other show or genre.

ChiaoGoo are my favorites hands down. They have sharp points that I like for lace. I haven't had too much trouble with the joins or with yarn catching. I did have one cable come out but I think it was my fault. It was a hot day and I tugged on them when the needle was stuck under something. (I tend to have a project in my car at all times so the heat got to it.) HiyaHiya are nice as well. Some people have had problems with the case because the needles aren't super secure. The join is nice but my yarn catches on part of the cable near the join. There is a little bump there on some of them. KnitPicks are affordable and pretty decent. They were my first set. I still use them frequently. The join comes undone if you don't use the key to tighten it. Don't think I have had too much trouble with them. The points are the dullest out of the three sets. Good luck finding a set and I hope you enjoy them!

I have opinions but these are just my preferences. \n\nI have heard that Knit Picks doesn't have all that great quality, but I haven't bought many needles from there. I guess they recently moved production/sourcing and it screwed some stuff up? Anyway, that's 3rd hand info for you. \n\nMy personal favorites are HiyaHiyas, followed by chiaogoo, followed by addi. And here's why:\n\n**addi** \n\n* well known for their brass needles, which smell funny to some people and have a more \"sticky\" feel than other metals\n* most flexible cords, which annoys me because the cord is EVERYWHERE OMG\n* most expensive (last I checked)\n* I have heard the joins on the interchangeables are excellent but I haven't used them myself\n* moderate sharpness\n\n**HiyaHiya**\n\n* HiyaHiya sharps are the sharpest - sharper than addi lace or chiaogoo lace (I think there is one brand that has sharper needles but I can't remember what it is)\n* Buying both sets is more expensive, but you get a wider range of sizes (US2-15 vs ... US4-10.5? I think?) \n* You can pick one or the other. Personally I use smaller yarn weights more so I got US2-8. \n* moderate flexibility cords\n* joins are good. I do have to rescrew mine relatively often\n* the smoothest needles ever (I think they're hallow stainless steel)\n\n**Chaiogoo**\n\n* I think these are brushed stainless? So they're heavier and more textured than the HiyaHiyas\n* the cord is designed to prevent kinking (yeah, I've kinked one though) so it's pretty stiff. Good for some things, not so good for magic loop\n* pretty sharp, close second to the HiyaHiyas\n* Can't speak to joins because I haven't used the interchangeables\n* I think these are the cheapest of the 3\n\nIf you haven't tried these, I highly encourage you to try the ones you are thinking of. I think needle choice is such a personal preference and you really won't know until you try. :)\n\n### Comment ID cx7iug7 with +2 score by [(BinChicken, Reddit, 2015-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx7iug7/) (in reply to ID cx79fhi):\nJust to expand on your point, I got the small set of hiya hiyas, and the larger sizes I picked up in the knitpicks metal needles.\r\rThis is because I find bulky yarn does not have as much trouble getting past things like joins.\n\n### Comment ID cx863j3 with +2 score by [(Celt42, Reddit, 2015-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx863j3/) (in reply to ID cx79fhi):\nLove the break down, thanks!\n\n## Comment ID cx792c9 with +3 score by [(arcticfawx, Reddit, 2015-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx792c9/) (in reply to ID 3tl1e8):\nI've never tried Hiya Hiya, but I have knitpicks and ChiaoGoo small set. Waiting a while to get the large set as well. I like the ChiaoGoos a LOT more than my knitpicks set. They're buttery smooth to knit with, nothing falls apart, the cables are so flexible they're awesome for magic looping. My knitpicks were constantly coming apart, the needles fell out of their sockets, the joins were snaggy, they needles unscrewed from the cables in the middle of projects and the cables were stiff as a rod with tons of memory. It was nearly impossible to do magic loop on my knitpicks without giant ladders because the stiffness in the cables kept wanting to push everything apart. I never use my knitpicks set anymore since getting the Chiaogoos, except on the rare occasion I need needle sizes larger than 5mm, since I don't have the large Chiaogoo set yet. I kinda wanna get rid of them completely but haven't gotten around to selling them yet. \n\nOn the other hand, knitpicks customer service is excellent, and they'll replace anything if you call them about it. But at this point about 70% of the needle tips I've gotten from them have been replaced or glued back together. It's not worth the effort. Though that's only the wood tips. The metal ones are fine, but issues with the cables and joins still apply.\n\n## Comment ID cx75ga2 with +2 score by [(emma1961, Reddit, 2015-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx75ga2/) (in reply to ID 3tl1e8):\nI have complete sets of both Hiya Hiya and ChiaoGoo. Both with 5\" needles.\n\nThe needles are pretty similar with the Hiya Hiya being a bit pointier.\n\nThe joins on both are secure and I don't have a preference of one over the other. \n\nNow, the cables is where things get interesting. Hands down, the TWIST Red Cables of the ChiaoGoo, beat out the Hiya Hiya cables. They're much, much more substantial and therefore lay nice and flat. The Hiya Hiya cables are very thin, like fishing line, and they are always in my way. The only thing about the Hiya Hiya cables that I like are that they swivel where the ChiaoGoo cables do not.\n\nThat being said, if I had only used the Hiya Hiya set I would have been perfectly happy with them. But since I have two sets to choose from, I keep reaching for the ChiaoGoo.\n\n## Comment ID cx760bo with +2 score by [(kauni, Reddit, 2015-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx760bo/) (in reply to ID 3tl1e8):\nI have the addis because the only way for the screw in interchangeables to stay together for me is loctite or super glue.

Addis are great but very pricey and only metal I do love their sock rockets tough. Knit picks is pretty low quality and every circular needle I have gotten from them has broken within 6 months and they wouldn't replace it for me. I would also recommend purchasing from jbw Bc they will replace or exchange broken needles pretty much lifetime. \n\nThe joins on the hiya hiya interchangeables are very smooth but do occasionally start to unscrew if working for a while but it's very easy to fix without taking off your project.\n\n### Comment ID cx860l5 with +1 score by [(Celt42, Reddit, 2015-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx860l5/) (in reply to ID cx7t54c):\nI'm discovering I'm not a fan of the wooden needles.

That last bit is brilliant.\n* I wouldn't give my ChiaoGoo up for anything and have a pretty complete set/multiples of the fixed red lace circulars.  \n* You can purchase the set of ChiaoGoo in two needle lengths; 4 inch or 5 inch. I use the 5 and wish I would have purchased the 4's.\n\nAddi\n\n* The addi case annoys the piss out of me due to not having a zipper on the pouch and the cables falling out of that open pouch. It's the little things...  However, I like how thin the case is.\n* I find it insulting that addi didn't include end stoppers in the set particularly considering how expensive the set is.  Talk about being cheap asshats.\n* For me, I cannot easily see where I need to line up the addi's to make the connection due to less than stellar eyesight.  \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't purchase something that has two different materials comprising the needle (birch/metal) owing to wood expanding and contracting. Seems like a problem waiting to happen though in fairness I don't own and haven't used.",

For as good as the sculpt gets, the paint is often spotty. They'll also skip out on obvious accessories like an atomic breath piece, which is annoying, as they absolutely have atomic breath effects pieces. They just need to make one that's pink/red.\n\nThat's how it was with the Minus One figure. Great sculpt, but mine had fucked up eyes, badly painted teeth and didn't come with a blue atomic breath piece like numerous other Godzilla figures that came before. The Minus One figure also ran for well over $100.\n\n### Comment ID laszxgk with +1 score by [(a-stupid-cat, Reddit, 2024-06-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GODZILLA/comments/1ccv3nu/between_hiya_toys_and_sh_monsterarts_evolved/laszxgk/) (in reply to ID l180xy3):\nYk I hate how ppl aren't realising the fact that for the uk hiya are going up to 100+ with shipping 😒\n\n## Comment ID l17wdl8 with +132 score by [(donotpluh, Reddit, 2024-04-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GODZILLA/comments/1ccv3nu/between_hiya_toys_and_sh_monsterarts_evolved/l17wdl8/) (in reply to ID 1ccv3nu):\nThe gut on Hiyas is very sucked in, SHMA has a better gut.

Honestly, though, I'm probably going to see if I can get both of them. ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n\n## Comment ID l8tannd with +1 score by [(EvoGoji29, Reddit, 2024-06-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GODZILLA/comments/1ccv3nu/between_hiya_toys_and_sh_monsterarts_evolved/l8tannd/) (in reply to ID 1ccv3nu):\nboth\n\n## Comment ID laszto0 with +1 score by [(a-stupid-cat, Reddit, 2024-06-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GODZILLA/comments/1ccv3nu/between_hiya_toys_and_sh_monsterarts_evolved/laszto0/) (in reply to ID 1ccv3nu):\nI have pre ordered both :D\n\n## Comment ID lbhe86g with +1 score by [(Queen-of-Sharks, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GODZILLA/comments/1ccv3nu/between_hiya_toys_and_sh_monsterarts_evolved/lbhe86g/) (in reply to ID 1ccv3nu):\nHiya Godzilla is so cool looking\n\n## Comment ID lg1l3ae with +1 score by [(Swimming-Ad4861, Reddit, 2024-08-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GODZILLA/comments/1ccv3nu/between_hiya_toys_and_sh_monsterarts_evolved/lg1l3ae/) (in reply to ID 1ccv3nu):\nWhy have one... when you can have both... think about it\n\n## Comment ID lglxsjb with +1 score by [(Equivalent_Past_9796, Reddit, 2024-08-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GODZILLA/comments/1ccv3nu/between_hiya_toys_and_sh_monsterarts_evolved/lglxsjb/) (in reply to ID 1ccv3nu):\nSo.....

I don’t live in EU so I cannot pass judgement for the second question.\n\nUltimately the figure itself is…alright. The design and paint scheme are wonderfully done but as with many collectible figures that have wonderful designs..impractical. \n\nFor me the overall figure was fairly floppy, but I didn’t expect much from such a design, it’s top heavy. The stand it comes with is cheap but works for the most part. \n\nSadly the figure suffers the typical ball joint socket issue because I couldn’t get the tails to connect into the holes..ever.

Definitely no \"good\" calls getting blocked; rather a few spam calls (I'd say about 5%) still get through. \n\nIt identifies robocallers & telemarketers quite well, but in India there's now a growing trend of telemarketers using their personal cells to call people, which is the ~5% I mentioned earlier. \n\nAll in all, I'd say it performs nearly as well as truecaller, but it's a better alternative given how truecaller is way too resource-hungry and collects too much data.

He struggled at the higher ranks, but he will be perfectly viable for a long time (not to mention getting buffed s3). However I can recommend Ky or Sol who are shoto esque and the more basic of the characters. Gio plays somewhat similar to Cammy, and the rest are a mixed bag. If you like mindgames then possibly Ino or Millia as they're heavy mix up characters but they come with a cost of low HP or struggling to get in. But yeah, you're definitely just gonna have to spend some time exploring the cast to get a feel, I'd just try a lot our versus some cpus and see who you vibe with.\n\n#### Comment ID jx6dwju with +7 score by [(Werducc, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/15xg3qm/hiya_any_tips_for_a_total_beginner_with_little/jx6dwju/) (in reply to ID jx6ae6t):\nI'd say try out either Potemkin or Nago\n\nFirst one is a slow grappler with sluggish, yet big normals and somewhat poor defense, but with a very rewarding strike/throw mixup. He usually always wants to be upfront to run his game. His damage off single hits is massive, yet he has issues with getting in against most of the cast. His Strike/throw also isn't the most ambiguous due to him not having alot of options, so he will have a hard time running his game against more experienced players.\n\nNago is not a grappler, but a defensive neutral based character whose main job is to use big pokes from mid-range in order to run his strike/throw mixup via his command grab and rekka. He has poor aerial movement like Potemkin, but unlike Potemkin he has a fast command dash which heavily improves his grounded footsies and makes his attacks unpredictable at times. His damage is also massive, but unlike Potemkin you achieve that damage through relatively simple combos instead of single hits. Also unlike Potemkin, his Strike/throw can be very ambiguous because he has ALOT of options off his rekka. He can grab, frametrap, bait and go back to neutral several ways just off his rekka alone. Nago might sound like a better Potemkin at this point, but there's one thing that really drags Nago down and that's the fact that you have to resource manage. Nago's blood gauge means death if it hits 3 bars and considering ALL of his special moves (other than his command grab) causes his blood gauge to rise, and you can find yourself having a hard time in neutral against characters who like to keep their distance, making him even weaker against zoning than Potemkin, since he's not allowed to make mistakes at all.\n\nKeep this all in mind and try both of these characters. If you find one of them enjoyable, refer to [Dustloop](https://www.dustloop.com/w/GGST) immediately. Here you will find all the info you will need to successfully run your main.\n\n#### Comment ID jx6yymu with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/15xg3qm/hiya_any_tips_for_a_total_beginner_with_little/jx6yymu/) (in reply to ID jx6ae6t):\nYou like grapplers play lot join the glue eaters become one of them do it you know you want to\n\n## Comment ID jx6x88c with +3 score by [(IDontWipe55, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/15xg3qm/hiya_any_tips_for_a_total_beginner_with_little/jx6x88c/) (in reply to ID 15xg3qm):\nGuilty Gear as a whole is super fast paced so you’ll just have to get used to it. I-No is a momentum based character with a moderately simple gameplan. She gets a knockdown 214P and then dashes in for a mixup with instant overheads and lows. Once you have your opponent conditioned you can go for a normal grab or her command grab super. She’s also got some long range specials like Manon. If she looks cool I’d definitely recommend playing her\n\n## Comment ID jx73k3h with +3 score by [(YAZF, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/15xg3qm/hiya_any_tips_for_a_total_beginner_with_little/jx73k3h/) (in reply to ID 15xg3qm):\nIn addition to the grappler suggestions other people have given, I'd also mention Anji shares Manon's dancer motif and her ability to \"dance\" though attacks. Except he goes for strike punishes rather than grabs. But pick whoever looks cool even if they are a different playstyle. My SF main has a radically different playstyle from my GG main. Also keep in mind season 3 for this game is later this week so alot of things will be changing then.\n\n## Comment ID jx621nf with +4 score by [(werewolfmask, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/15xg3qm/hiya_any_tips_for_a_total_beginner_with_little/jx621nf/) (in reply to ID 15xg3qm):\nheh! looks like the future is an unwritten book, here. pot is so freakin’ smooth, why not put some time in with him?\n\n## Comment ID jx6amoe with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/15xg3qm/hiya_any_tips_for_a_total_beginner_with_little/jx6amoe/) (in reply to ID 15xg3qm):\ndon't worry about winning, just choose a bunch of character you think look cool, look at their list of moves, and get into a match to try them out. you'll  usually realize pretty quick whether or not you vibe with a particular character's \"thing\". ino and millia are both mixup setplay characters  where your goal is to knock your opponent down, hit them with a high/low (or left/right) mix, and repeat. potemkins entire thing is just landing the command grab, and goldlewis's thing is behemoth typhoon, where he has a bunch of different ways to swing the coffin with different half-circle inputs. just try them out and see what feels good!\n\n## Comment ID jx6bd6r with +2 score by [(Call_Me_Chaos2, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/15xg3qm/hiya_any_tips_for_a_total_beginner_with_little/jx6bd6r/) (in reply to ID 15xg3qm):\nYour asking for help so there’s no reason to be sorry, I’d recommend you to try characters out till you find the one that just clicks and aside from that have fun\n\n## Comment ID jx6gi7g with +1 score by [(Ver_El_, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/15xg3qm/hiya_any_tips_for_a_total_beginner_with_little/jx6gi7g/) (in reply to ID 15xg3qm):\nquick question, did the game put you into floor 2 after the bot match or did you get put in floor 4 and then fell to floor 2.\n\nAsking because as far as I know floor 4 is the lowest that the bot places people, so just want to check.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a mission mode that you should check out. The thing labelled \"tutorial\" sucks, but the mission mode goes over all the mechanics.  \nDo/learn a lot of those, and look up and practice a few easy combos with your characters and you'll quickly rise to like floor 7 or something.\n\n### Comment ID jx7139v with +1 score by [(epicsimitt, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/15xg3qm/hiya_any_tips_for_a_total_beginner_with_little/jx7139v/) (in reply to ID jx6gi7g):\nUmm not sure, I played against the bot and it said f2 was the recommended one\n\n## Comment ID jx8noch with +1 score by [(Ranger2580, Reddit, 2023-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/15xg3qm/hiya_any_tips_for_a_total_beginner_with_little/jx8noch/) (in reply to ID 15xg3qm):\nHey, I also came from barely any experience in SF6, then crawled my way up to Floor 8. Best advice I can give is to try out everyone in the roster in training mode/CPU matches and just see who feels best. Start with the easiest to play (Sol and Ky) then work your way down.\n\nIn my case, I'm a Gold Luke/Ken in SF6, so everyone recommended Sol, but after trying them all I settled on Nago. Typically a bad character for beginners but he just kinda clicked for me.\n\nIIRC Manon has pretty long normals and her semicircle command grab, but no charge inputs. Nago, Ramlethal, Goldlewis and maybe even Testament if you're willing to get DLC might be good.\n\n## Comment ID jx8u3t3 with +1 score by [(QuarterDefiant6132, Reddit, 2023-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/15xg3qm/hiya_any_tips_for_a_total_beginner_with_little/jx8u3t3/) (in reply to ID 15xg3qm):\nNago has far reaching attacks and a command grab so maybe you'll find him similar to Manon (never played SF6 so idk), he's a strong character,  you just need to get used to managing his meter\n\n## Comment ID jx939lj with +1 score by [(SimonogatariII, Reddit, 2023-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/15xg3qm/hiya_any_tips_for_a_total_beginner_with_little/jx939lj/) (in reply to ID 15xg3qm):\nIf you like Millia or I-no, just stick with them, practice their combos, and the game will slowly become more readable to you even if it's faster than SF. Right now you're just being overwhelmed by your speed, their speed, the bursts and RCs and so on, but as you get used to them it'll be less overwhelming. \n\nBut, yeah, if you played Manon the way I see most of the time, your easiest counterpart is probably Nago.\n\n## Comment ID jx97sj3 with +1 score by [(Arnoods, Reddit, 2023-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/15xg3qm/hiya_any_tips_for_a_total_beginner_with_little/jx97sj3/) (in reply to ID 15xg3qm):\nWhen I came to GG after UMVC3, I went with who was the most attractive to me. Everyone is viable. However! Since you play Manon, you might like Potemkin and Anji. Baiken is a lot of fun too if you buy/have the pass. Go with your gut."

          "content": "It’s hard to fathom how this company stays in business with such a poor app. It must be because it’s used as the default call ID/blocker on Samsung phones. On iOS, it’s absolutely worthless.\n\nI previously used a competing product that was terrific, but for some reason my current carrier isn’t compatible with too many of these solutions, so I had to purchase a subscription to Hiya instead.\n\nDespite having all settings exactly as required, and even after deactivating and reactivating, the app literally does nothing. It will allow every phone call through, known or unknown, unless you manually enter into the block list, so every unwanted call is going to ring your phone at least the first time.\n\nSecondly, don’t expect the call lookup to give you any information, which is comical because it’s the main point of the app. It almost always comes up as “Unknown Caller” and serves up no information. I almost always have to resort to doing a Google search to investigate the number myself.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, it doesn’t block unknown calls (and yes, I have the phone’s “Silence Unknown Calls” setting on, and all toggles on for Hiya to screen and block calls. It’s not user error), and 99% of the time it can’t identify the caller when using the lookup feature. So tell me, what exactly did I purchase an annual subscription for?\n\nAs I write this, the last update by the developers was four months ago. Doesn’t really instill confidence that there’s any attention given to this app.\n\nI know this review is harsh, but that’s how ineffective and frustrating the app is. Do not waste your money!",

This app is absolutely amazing, and I love the reverse phone number look up. This is going to be such a timesaver for me because of all of the interruptions I’ve been having from unwanted calls.

I was told to google it.  Switching soon.  Do not call list is not affective either",

      "# [Hiya News: Global Phone Spam and Fraud Report: Nearly a Third of All Unknown Calls in First Half of 2024 Were Unwanted](https://www.hiya.com/press-releases/global-phone-spam-and-fraud-report-nearly-a-third-of-all-unknown-calls-in-first-half-of-2024-were-unwanted)\nSeattle, Washington (August 22, 2024) Hiya, the global leader in voice security, has published H1 2024 Global Call Threat Report, which explores the volume, frequency and type of phone spam and fraud across major global markets between January and June of 2024.\n\nDownload Hiya’s H1 2024 Global Call Threat Report to learn more: https://hiya.com/global-call-threat-report\n\nIn the first six months of 2024, Hiya flagged nearly 20 billion calls as suspected spam – more than 107 million spam calls everyday. Hiya’s data showed spam flag rates of more than 20% of unknown calls (calls coming from outside of someone’s address book) in 25 out of the 42 countries included in the report – with some spam flag rates above 50%.\n\nThe first half of 2024 also saw an increase in AI deepfake scams, which use AI-generated voice-cloning technology to impersonate people and/or organizations. Ahead of the primary election in January, voters in New Hampshire received robocalls impersonating Joe Biden using an AI-generated voice. As AI tools become more powerful and accessible, Hiya anticipates that voice-cloning impersonation scam tactics will continue to be on the rise in 2024 and beyond.\n\nMedicare and insurance scams continue to target Americans\n\nAmericans received an average of 14 spam calls per month in the first six months of 2024. The rate of spam flag rate varies state-by-state with Oklahoma, Indiana and Ohio having the highest rates of spam in H1, while Alaska, New York and North Dakota had the lowest. Health insurance and medicare scams were popular in the US between January and June followed by other insurance scams, including auto, home, and life. Tax scams were also on the rise in the first half, and steadily increased leading up to the April 15 tax filing deadline.\n\nFrance and Spain continues to have the worst spam across Europe, for past 7 quarters\n\nMore than half of all unknown calls in France and Spain were unwanted – with spam flag rates of 53% and 51%, respectively. On average French and Spanish residents receive more than 12 nuisance or fraud calls each month. Despite similar spam flag rates, Spain has a bigger fraud problem as 12% of unknown calls are fraud compared to 5% in France.\n\nThe most commonly reported fraud calls in Spain were utility and mobile phone sales scams. In February, a new TikTok scam call emerged as users reported robocalls offering 800 Euros a day to watch and like videos on TikTok. Utility related scams, including electricity suppliers and solar energy, were the top scams in the first half of 2024 in France. Telemarketing calls, banking-related scam calls and package delivery scams were also common.\n\nUK residents are targeted with tax agency and Amazon scams\n\nThe UK had a spam flag rate of 28% of all unknown calls, and 3% of those calls were fraud in H1. Popular phone scams across the UK in the first half of the year included tax scams, specifically impersonating Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), Amazon scams and credit card scams. Cryptocurrency, energy-related and immigration scams were also on the rise.\n\nBrazillians receive the most spam calls per month across the globe\n\nBrazillians received an average 26 spam calls per month in the first half of 2024. More than half of the unidentified calls in the country were spam (51%) with 13% of those being fraud. Banking scams are the most popular phone scam across Brazil with Hiya users reporting scammers impersonating a bank and calling to confirm personal information and passwords.\n\nAmazon scams surged across Canada\n\nWhile Canadians only received an average of 4 spam calls per person each month, 7% of those calls were fraud. In 2023, Amazon scams were the most popular scam targeting Canadians and continued into the first half of 2024 – hitting a peak in mid-April. Scams impersonating government officials were also popular in H1 followed by credit card and cryptocurrency scams.\n\n“Phone fraud, spam and the emerging use of AI-driven deepfake voice scams are escalating threats to the voice channel, affecting every phone user across every major market,” shared Kush Parikh, President of Hiya. “The voice channel deserves the same level of vigilance that enterprises apply to cybersecurity. In fact, voice security must be swiftly integrated into cybersecurity strategies, as it represents a significant vulnerability in protecting enterprises.”\n\nHiya report methodology\n\nThe H1 2024 Global Call Threat Report is based on a representative sample of calls observed by Hiya on the Hiya Voice Security Network, which includes Samsung Smart Call enabled devices and the Hiya mobile app. The spam ratios in this report represent unknown calls outside of an individual’s contact list calls that Hiya has identified and flagged as either fraud or nuisance.\n\nDownload the complete H1 2024 Global Call Threat Report to learn more.\n\n‍\n\nAbout Hiya",

      "# [Biden voice-clone robocall highlights AI-generated phone scams by Patchen Noelke](https://blog.hiya.com/biden-voice-clone-robocall-highlights-ai-generated-phone-scams)\nThe Joe Biden voice-clone robocall encouraging voters not to vote in the Democratic primary in New Hampshire was an eerie reminder that AI-generated robocalls and scam calls are here to stay.\n\nThe New Hampshire primary in January marked the first contest for the Democrats in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, so we’ll likely see even more of these fake political messages — targeting various candidates and issues — leading up to the general election in November.\n\nOn Jan. 22, NBC News reported on a robocall that appeared to be an unlawful attempt at voter suppression. The call featured a voice clone of President Biden directed at New Hampshire voters:\n\n“It’s important that you save your vote for the November election. We’ll need your help in electing Democrats up and down the ticket. Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again. Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday.”\n\nAdditionally, NBC noted that the call was spoofed. The phone number that showed up on recipients’ phones was that of the former chairperson of the New Hampshire Democratic Party.\n\nAlthough unrelated to the Biden AI scam, it’s interesting to note that New Hampshire had the highest percentage of spam calls of any US state, according to Hiya’s Q3 2023 Global Call Threat Report.\n\nThe threat of voice-clone scams\n\nEven though the phony Biden call was small scale compared to some of the massive scam campaigns, it underscores the threat posed by AI-generated voice clones in political messages and in perpetrating phone scams.\n\nIn our blog post, Voice fraud and the threat of generative AI, Hiya’s Chief Product Officer James Lau showed how easy it is for scammers to use readily available software to carry out phone scams. And while voice cloning technology existed during the last presidential election, the rapid advances in AI since then have made these calls possible by people with limited technological abilities.\n\nFCC makes voice-clone calls illegal\n\nLess than three weeks after the Biden voice-clone call, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) unanimously adopted a ruling stating that calls made with AI-generated voices are considered “artificial” under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and are, therefore, illegal. The TCPA is the primary law the FCC uses to help limit junk calls and requires telemarketers to obtain written consent from consumers before robocalling them. According to a press release issued by the FCC:\n\n“The rise of these types of calls has escalated during the last few years as this technology now has the potential to confuse consumers with misinformation by imitating the voices of celebrities, political candidates, and close family members. While currently State Attorneys Generals can target the outcome of an unwanted AI-voice generated robocall — such as the scam or fraud they are seeking to perpetrate — this action now makes the act of using AI to generate the voice in these robocalls itself illegal, expanding the legal avenues through which state law enforcement agencies can hold these perpetrators accountable.”\n\nFighting back against unwanted calls\n\nYou may wonder if call protection services such as Hiya Protect can stop voice clone calls from reaching the public. We asked Hiya’s Sr. Product Manager, Jonathan Nelson, for the answer.\n\n“Hiya doesn’t listen to the audio of incoming calls, so we don’t know the content of a call before it reaches the recipient,” Nelson said. “However, the actual method of making the call is unchanged. So everything we do to detect spam calls works just as well against voice clone campaigns.”\n\nOne of the weapons in Hiya’s spam-fighting arsenal is its use of Adaptive AI, the industry’s first self-learning spam protection system that adjusts to the latest fraud and nuisance calls. Unlike other solutions, Adaptive AI has four layers of protection that together analyze every aspect of the phone call: from the phone number to the call recipient, the enterprise making the call, and the characteristics of the call itself.\n\nHiya’s Adaptive AI technology analyzes every facet of a call to provide the most complete and effective spam and fraud call protection available.\n\nBase protections analyze the phone number. This first layer of protection considers the characteristics and history of phone numbers making calls. This includes key compliance checks (such as number validity), characteristics of phone numbers (such as the type of line used), and trends in past calling behavior (such as call quantity and how recipients receive calls).\n\nSpam Threat Scanning uses data left behind by spammers in carrier network traffic. It analyzes the characteristics of a call — in real-time — to determine each unique call’s spam risk, regardless of the phone number. This is a crucial tool in identifying emerging new spam and fraud tactics.\n\nPersonal Call Filtering recognizes spam is best viewed through the eyes of the individual call recipient. One person’s unwanted call might be another person’s important call. Hiya Protect uses the person’s past interactions with callers to understand which connections are important to them and protect them from targeted attacks.\n\nEnterprise Call Scoring assesses incoming calls based on the caller’s history across all the numbers they own, similar to how credit bureaus assign data-driven scores to analyze creditworthiness. This allows Hiya to assess the reputation of callers regardless of the numbers they’re calling from, a vital tool when spammers use tactics like switching phone numbers to evade spam labeling (a practice known as number rotation).",

      "# [How to detect and defend against deepfake voice scams by Shaun Kehrberg](https://blog.hiya.com/how-to-detect-and-defend-against-audio-deepfakes)\nPhone scams have been around since practically the invention of the landline. But there’s a dangerous new element making scam calls even more convincing: the use of deepfake voice technology.\n\nA deepfake can be any type of media — audio, video, image— that has been digitally manipulated, typically for the purpose of misleading people or changing the original meaning. A voice deepfake, sometimes known as AI voice cloning, uses artificial intelligence to construct spoken sentences that sound like people saying something they did not actually say. This voice track can even be placed underneath real video footage, making it appear as if a person has endorsed or carries an opinion contrary to their own. The coupling of real video and false audio can make these deepfakes more challenging to detect and flag.\n\nDeepfake voice scams aren’t new, but AI is making them more real and easier to create. In the past, deepfakes required a significant amount of time and technical expertise. Today, there are more than a dozen AI voice cloning tools freely available on the internet. These tools require only a basic level of expertise to use.\n\nRELATED: See how our Chief Product Officer Faked the Voice of Hiya's CEO\n\nExamples of deepfake voice scams\n\nFamily emergency scams – Family emergency scams, sometimes called loved-ones scams or grandparent scams, involve a fraudster pretending to be a family member who is experiencing an emergency and in need of immediate financial help. In the past, fraudsters might simply imitate a sobbing child or grandchild, but now scammers can use AI voice cloning that makes the ruse ever more convincing.\n\nEmployee impersonations – Employee impersonations using deepfake voice technology are also becoming more common. News reports tell of an employee paying out $25 million after being fooled by a deepfake video call impersonating the company’s CFO, and a hacker deepfaking an employee’s voice to gain access to the company’s computer systems.\n\nPolitical deepfakes – One of the most prominent deepfake voice scams occurred earlier this year, as the U.S. presidential election season was just getting underway. In the Democratic primary in New Hampshire, a deepfake voice clone of President Joe Biden was used in a robocall to voters urging them to skip primary voting and instead save their vote for the general election.\n\nCompanies are beginning to take notice of this trend. In a survey conducted by the identity verification firm Regula, 37% of worldwide organizations have experienced voice deepfake identity fraud, and 82% or organizations think that voice deepfakes will be a growing threat in the next two years.\n\nDeepfake voice detection by humans is unreliable\n\nAccording to a 2023 study conducted by researchers from the Department of Security and Crime Science at University College London in the UK, humans cannot reliably detect speech deepfakes. In an experiment conducted with more than 500 participants, individuals listened to real and fake audio clips and attempted to differentiate between them. The result: listeners could only correctly identify voice deepfakes 73% of the time.\n\nThe study concluded, “As speech synthesis algorithms improve and become more realistic, we can expect the detection task to become harder. The difficulty of detecting speech deepfakes confirms their potential for misuse and signals that defenses against this threat are needed.”\n\nGovernmental regulations seek to rein in deepfakes\n\nThe battle against deepfakes and AI voice scams needs to be fought on multiple fronts. Governments play a role too. In August, the European Union’s AI Act was enacted. It’s the world’s first major law regulating the use of AI, and it governs the way companies develop, use and apply AI.\n\nAccording to NBC News, “The legislation applies a risk-based approach to regulating AI, which means that different applications of the technology are regulated differently depending on the level of risk they pose to society.” Examples of high-risk AI systems include autonomous vehicles, medical devices, loan decisioning systems, educational scoring, and remote biometric identification systems.\n\nThe United States is also drafting laws to protect against impersonations and deepfakes. Earlier this year, the US Federal Trade Commission sought public comment on a proposal that would prohibit the impersonation of individuals, which would extend protections of a new rule on government and business impersonation.\n\nAccording to the FTC, “The agency is taking this action in light of surging complaints around impersonation fraud, as well as public outcry about the harms caused to consumers and to impersonated individuals. Emerging technology — including AI-generated deepfakes — threatens to turbocharge this scourge, and the FTC is committed to using all of its tools to detect, deter, and halt impersonation fraud.”\n\nEven US states are passing legislation to combat deepfakes. Recently, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 2839 (AB 2839). The law aims to address the rise of AI-generated disinformation ahead of 2024 elections, stating that AB 2839 is crucial for protecting the integrity of elections and restoring voter trust.\n\nHow to defend against deepfake voice imposters\n\nAlthough scams carried out using deepfake speech synthesis pose a danger for both individuals and business, not all is lost. Fortunately, there is a way to identify deepfakes. While fraudsters are using AI for sinister purposes, the same technology can also be used for good.\n\nEarlier this month, Hiya acquired Locus.ai, the industry leader in deepfake detection solutions. The combination of Loccus.ai’s voice intelligence technology and the Hiya’s Adaptive AI fraud prevention system, provides businesses and carriers with the most complete fraud call protection available across the industry today. This versatile solution supports multiple languages, formats, and platforms, including video recordings and live calls across all devices.\n\nLoccus.ai’s deepfake voice detection technology is now available as Hiya AI Voice Detection. Businesses and carriers can immediately integrate AI voice detection into their own services and applications to enhance consumer trust and security. With Hiya, it’s never been easier to identify deepfake audio in personal communications apps, news and social media content, video conferencing contact center platforms, and more.",
      "# [Interview: Angelo Cheng (Hiya Toys) by Chris Mirjahangir on 2024-09-23](https://www.tohokingdom.com/blog/interview-angelo-cheng-hiya-toys/)\nThe following is a joint interview with myself and site contributor Michal Shipman with Chief Marketing Officer Angelo Cheng from Hiya Toys. It was conducted on the show floor at San Diego Comic-Con 2024.\n\nIn addition, although there are finished and painted promotional releases of Shimo, Godzilla 2000, and Godzilla 2001 out there, I thought it might be fun to include shots of the earlier work in progress sculpts. Thank you Angelo for taking them out of the case for me!\n\nCHRIS: Do you mind sharing a little about Hiya Toys for those who don’t know?\n\nANGELO: I’m Angelo from Hiya Toys and we’ve been producing collectible figures into the market since 2013. Last year we had very exciting things to announce, including Godzilla, at SDCC. We’ve received a lot of good feedback since and hopefully we can continue with this momentum moving forward to bring you more product and continue expanding properties into our catalog.\n\nCHRIS: What inspired Hiya Toys to start working with the Godzilla franchise?\n\nANGELO: We love it! The CEO, the designer, the team; all of us are passionate fans and we hope you can see that in our product.\n\nCHRIS: What is it like working with Toho?\n\nANGELO: We’ve developed a very good relationship with Toho & Legendary and hope to continue it to bring fans the product they’re asking for.\n\nCHRIS: What is Hiya Toys’ goal with the Godzilla franchise? Do you plan on making collectibles for years and years or just for a short while due to licensing?\n\nANGELO: For the Godzilla franchise, we would hope it’s for the long term because we have proven a success with our Godzilla figures in the market. Continued success will help us drive towards the next three, five, even ten years or more. To elaborate, some properties can last long term or short term. For Godzilla, it’s very promising.\n\nCHRIS: Currently there are two lines for Godzilla within Hiya Toys: Exquisite Basic and Stylist. Are there any others in the works?\n\nANGELO: Not for Godzilla, no, sorry.\n\nCHRIS: Up until recently, Hiya Toys Godzilla line has been known for Legendary/MonsterVerse products. Now we’re seeing Heisei and some Millennium on display here at SDCC. What other eras of Godzilla are you able to do? Specifically, are you able to do Showa & Reiwa?\n\nANGELO: So, we have almost all of the properties from Toho and Legendary. The process in acquiring them is done step by step. At this time, we are focusing on all of the Godzilla figures that are presented here at SDCC and later on, step by step, we will try our best to bring new figures of the Godzilla franchise into the market. Right now, we can’t say what eras are confirmed, but we promise you that more items are on the way.\n\nCHRIS: Are you open to doing video game characters from the Godzilla franchise like Super Godzilla or Bagan?\n\nANGELO: Possibly… Right now, our product plan is still focusing on the what’s seen in the movies. We would like to get to make figures from new movies like Godzilla Singular Point and Godzilla Minus One. These are in our plan and once we’re able to do those, we can talk later about Super Godzilla & Bagan. If there are other characters you’d like to see, we would also like to know more about them.\n\nCHRIS: Do you see your fan feedback and how do you implement that?\n\nANGELO: We regularly check fan feedback through social channels like X, Facebook, and Instagram. A lot of what we see is what they would like to see in the future, which is good, but we also look for criticisms as well. It’s all good feedback for us to improve and plan looking into the future. We hope to make our fans’ dreams come true.\n\nCHRIS: Are there plans to implement features like LED or Sound Effects in future releases?\n\nANGELO: Yes. On display, we have the Heat Ray Godzilla Ultimate Version, from Godzilla vs. Kong (2021), that will have LED. However, I’m sorry to say that at this moment it’s just in the prototype phase with no LED in it. We hope to show you more in the future!\n\nCHRIS: When Hiya Toys announced it was making Godzilla figures, it teased an image with MonsterVerse characters. All have been made except for Mechagodzilla. Is it still on the way?\n\nANGELO: Maybe.\n\nCHRIS: Could we see characters from the MonsterVerse comics appear as action figures?\n\nANGELO: I think right now, we have what we have in terms of the MonsterVerse.\n\nCHRIS: What kind of attention between MonsterVerse and Classic Toho will you be putting out moving forward?\n\nANGELO: It’s very difficult to say. It’s not straight forward like 50/50 or whatever. What we do is we have our product plan and test the market with said product. If this product is good or not, then we will decide to move forward or not. So, it’s not so clear cut. It really depends on the market.\n\nCHRIS: Do you have anything you’d like to share with the fans? What to expect in the future or any hints as to what’s to come beyond what’s been revealed at SDCC?",
      "# [Brutally Honest Hiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods Review by Rebekah on 2024-10-15](https://twomamabears.com/brutally-honest-hiya-kids-daily-greens-superfoods-review/)\nAs a mom of three kids (ages 2, 4, and 6), I’m always looking for ways to sneak in more nutrition.\n\nSo, when I heard about Hiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods, I was intrigued. You’re telling me you stuffed things like marine algae, alfalfa, and beets into this powder and it actually tastes like chocolate? I was definitely skeptical, but curious.\n\nBut at $54 per month for one kid, I had to ask myself: even if this tastes incredible, is it really worth the price?\n\nWell, I’ve been testing it out, and here’s what I’ve found so far.\n\nMy Honest First Impressions\n\nMy first impression? This powder is expensive.\n\nI learned through my research that the price is right in line with comparable brands, but it’s a lot of money to shell out, especially if you have multiple kids. The 50% off offer for the first month helps, but still.\n\nBut price aside, my husband and I were blown away by the flavor. It tastes like chocolate powder – no weird aftertaste or even a hint that this stuff is packed with dozens of fruits and veggies like kale, wheatgrass, and broccoli.\n\nIt’s easy to mix into your kid’s milk, but as a baker, I like how versatile it is. I even mixed some into my sourdough pancake batter, and my son thought it was amazing.\n\nP.S.: If you like sourdough, check out my other blog called That Sourdough Gal!\n\nIf you’re like me and always trying to find sneaky ways to add healthy stuff into your kids’ diet without them noticing, this powder is definitely worth a try.\n\nWhat Stands Out About Hiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods\n\nTastes Like Chocolate: The best part is this stuff actually tastes good. The chocolate flavor comes from real cocoa powder, so it’s delicious without artificial sweeteners. If your kids love chocolate milk, this is an easy sell.\n\nVersatile and Easy to Use: One scoop mixed with milk or a milk substitute makes a tasty drink. But it doesn’t stop there—you can also add it to oatmeal, yogurt, smoothies, or even bake it into cookies or pancakes for a sneaky nutrition boost.\n\nAbsorbs Fast: Because it’s a powder, it absorbs fast. That means your kids are getting those vitamins and minerals almost immediately.\n\nZero Added Sugar: Hiya’s known for keeping its products sugar-free, and this one is no different. The sweetness comes from a mix of cocoa and stevia, so you don’t have to worry about unnecessary sugars.\n\nHow Does It Compare to Other Kids’ Greens Supplements?\n\nMany greens supplements are either too focused on adult needs or loaded with probiotics your kids might already be getting elsewhere.\n\nHiya’s blend feels more thoughtfully crafted for kids. It’s packed with over 55 whole-food ingredients, including organic greens, superfoods, and digestive enzymes, but without going overboard.\n\nPlus, it doesn’t have any of those questionable herbs that some kids’ supplements throw in.\n\nHere’s how Hiya stacks up to some of the other options out there. A couple of these are gummies, so not exactly apples to apples, but they all aim to do the same thing.\n\nRelated: Hiya Probiotics Review: Is It the Best Probiotic for Toddlers?\n\nIs It Worth the Price?\n\nLet’s talk price because I know this can be a dealbreaker for many of us, especially in this economy.\n\nHiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods costs $54 per month for one child. That kind of makes my stomach flip to be completely honest.\n\nAt least the first month is half off, so you can try it for only $27.\n\nIf you’ve got more than one kid, the price drops. For two kids, it’s $50 per kid, and for three kids, it goes down to $45 per kid.\n\nMy kids really love the flavor, and I love that they’re getting extra fruits and veggies. But I just can’t see myself shelling out that much money every month.\n\nOnce a quarter? Yes, I’m in.\n\nBut as a daily thing, it’s a bit out of reach right now to be completely honest.\n\nThat said, for a high-quality product packed with whole-food ingredients, this price might be worth it for families wanting to boost their kids’ nutrition without any hassle.\n\nWhat You Need to Know Before You Buy\n\nHere are a few details that could help you decide if this is worth your money:\n\nAge-Appropriate: Hiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods is made for kids ages 2 and up. You can even double the serving for older kids or teens who need an extra energy boost.\n\nEco-Friendly: You’ll get a canister with your first order, and after that, monthly refills come in pouches to reduce waste.\n\nNutrient-Dense: This greens powder is full of vitamins and minerals that support everything from growth and cognition to digestion and immune health.\n\nThe Ingredients Breakdown\n\nIf you like to dig into the details (I always do!), here’s a quick look at what’s inside:\n\nEssential Nutrients: Includes Vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, and protein for healthy bones, teeth, and energy.\n\nFour Proprietary Blends:\n\nKid’s Essential Greens: Organic greens like kale and wheatgrass.\n\nKid’s Superfood: Supercharged with quinoa and turmeric.\n\nKid’s Digestion: Fruits like banana and blueberry for easy digestion.\n\nKid’s Core Development: Marine algae and vitamin D2 for brain health.\n\nRelated: Don’t Buy Hiya Bedtime Essentials Until You Read This Review\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMy kids really enjoy the taste of this Hiya greens powder, and I love knowing they’re getting extra fruits and veggies. However, I personally can’t justify spending this much every month.\n\nOnce a quarter? Absolutely, I’m on board.\n\nBut as a daily expense, it’s a bit too much for our family, to be honest.\n\nHowever, that’s just me.\n\nIf you’re looking for a way to get more greens into your kids’ diet without the battle, Hiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods might just be the solution you’ve been searching for.\n\nHiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods FAQs\n\nWhat age is Hiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods recommended for?\n\nHiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods is recommended for kids ages 2 and up.\n\nHow do you use Hiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods?\n\nMix one scoop of Hiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods powder with milk, a milk substitute, or blend it into foods like oatmeal, yogurt, or smoothies.\n\nYou can even add it to your favorite baking recipe for nutrient-packed goodies.\n\nWhat is Hiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods sweetened with?\n\nHiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods is sweetened naturally with cocoa powder and stevia and contains 0 grams of added sugar.\n\nCan my child take Hiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods with other Hiya products?\n\nYes! Each Hiya product is designed with a unique set of ingredients and minimal overlap, so they complement each other perfectly.\n\nWhen should I give my kids Hiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods?\n\nYou can give your kids a scoop of the daily Greens + Superfoods powder either in the morning or evening, depending on what works best for your schedule.\n\nHow long does one bottle of Hiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods last?\n\nEach pouch contains enough powder for a month’s supply (one scoop per day).",

      "# [5 easy ways to dodge your kids back-to-school germs by Dahlia Rimmon, Dahlia Rimmon MS, lifestyle brands, kids products on 2024-08-20](https://hiyahealth.com/blogs/parent-pointers/5-easy-ways-to-dodge-your-kids-back-to-school-germs)\nSummer’s officially over, the kids are back in school (woohoo!), and life’s starting to feel somewhat normal again. But just as you're settling into your routine, one kid is sent home with a fever, the other one’s rocking the cough-and-runny-nose combo, and now you’re starting to feel a little icky too. Yep, it’s back-to-school season—the time when all those pesky germs, bugs, and recurring illnesses make their grand entrance. With crowded classrooms, iffy handwashing, and kids swapping snacks and toys, schools turn into prime breeding grounds for germs. Don’t worry, I’ve got your back. Here are 5 easy ways to dodge those back-to-school germs to keep everyone feeling healthy and happy.\n\n1. Make hand washing fun\n\nWe all know that good hand washing prevents germs from spreading, but getting kids to do it can be a real challenge, especially when they’re at school. At home, you can be the handwashing police making sure they scrub up before meals and after playing outside. But once they’re at school, it’s a bit of a free-for-all. With so many kids and not enough teachers, you can’t always be sure your child washed their hands after getting messy in the mud at recess.\n\nTo help your kids remember and make it a habit (even when you’re not around to supervise!), turn handwashing into something fun. Here are some cool ideas to get them excited about keeping those hands squeaky clean:\n\nPack some colorful soap sticks in their backpack to make applying soap way more exciting.\n\nGive them a special notebook to track their hand washing at school. They can turn it in for a prize, an extra bedtime story, or a bit of extra playtime.\n\nFill a liquid soap dispenser with colorful glitter and pack for school. It not only makes handwashing more fun (because who doesn’t love glitter?), but it also helps them see when all the soap is rinsed off.\n\nMake mini homemade soaps to give out to their friends at school. Hide a small toy in the center of each soap to make handwashing a fun treasure hunt, rewarding them with a prize after they’ve used the soap enough times.\n\nClip cute mini hand sanitizer bottles to their backpack and lunchbox for on-the-go cleaning.\n\n2. Teach kids to keep snacks to themselves\n\nOkay, hear me out—this might sound a bit strict, but there's a good reason behind it. Kids love swapping snacks, which is great for encouraging sharing, but it’s also a prime opportunity for passing around germs—especially if they touch their mouth or tongue and then reach back into the snack bag. Instead, explain to your kids that their snacks are packed just for them to help their bodies grow and stay energized. If they’re having a hard time with it, pack an extra snack bag for their friend—but make sure to clear it with their parents first. This way, your child can share without spreading germs.\n\n3. Encourage an early bedtime on school days\n\nSleep isn’t just about staying focused in school and having enough energy for play and extracurricular activities; it’s also important for keeping our immune system strong and our bodies healthy. While we sleep, our immune cells get a recharge, helping us fight off illness and infections. That’s why a lack of sleep can make us more likely to get sick. So, even if your kid seems okay, a good night’s sleep will keep them energized for the school day, in a great mood, and ready to fend off those school germs.\n\nThere might be a few tantrums, but sticking to an early bedtime on school nights helps your kids get the rest they need. It might mean turning out the lights sooner or starting an earlier bedtime routine, so that they’re calm, relaxed, and ready for bed. A restful bedtime routine could include a warm bath, dimming the lights, giving them a winddown aid, reading a book (and turning off screens!), and turning down the temperature to make the room cool and cozy.\n\n4. Put them in the bath right away\n\nI don’t know about you, but my kids come home from school absolutely filthy—paint on their faces, dirt on their clothes, and somehow their knees are always stained black. I’m not mad about it because it means they’ve had a fun day at school, but I know it also means they’ve been busy and probably picked up all sorts of germs. Especially for my toddlers, as soon as we get home from carpool, I scoop them up from their car seats and head straight to the bath. This way, they’re squeaky clean at home and we avoid spreading grime through the house or transferring germs to their toys.\n\n5. Consider a kids greens powder\n\nWhether your kid is a picky eater or not, a greens powder can be a convenient way to pack in a ton of nutrients from fruits and veggies into one small scoop. So, if your child skips the sliced bell peppers in their lunch or turns down the blueberries at breakfast, adding a greens powder to their daily routine can help fill in those gaps. And how do fruits and veggies help with back-to-school germs? Fruits and veggies are loaded with vitamins and minerals that boost the immune system so it can do it’s job of helping fend off those dreadful bugs and germs.\n\nThat’s why I’m a fan of Hiya Kids Daily Greens + Superfoods—it’s packed with over 55 whole food ingredients and antioxidants, specifically designed for kids, and supports their immune system, brain health, growth, and digestion. Even better, unlike other green powders that can taste earthy or bitter, this one is chocolate-flavored, so it’s tasty on its own or mixes easily into recipes without needing to disguise the flavor. Just mix a scoop into milk or a non-dairy drink, and serve it with meals or snacks. You can also blend it into smoothies or mix it into oatmeal. Get creative!\n\nRemember, with kids around, you can't be a complete germaphobe. You don’t need to go overboard with cleanliness, and don’t push too hard on your kids—if there’s one thing I’ve learned from parenting, it’s that being too strict can backfire, and you’ll end up with kids running around with dirty hands despite your best efforts. The goal is to teach your kids about germ prevention and create sustainable routines and habits to stay healthy at school.\n\nBest of luck to you this school year!",
