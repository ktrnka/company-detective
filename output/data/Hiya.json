      "# [Imposter Apps and How to Spot Them: Chronicles of App Store Imitators by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/imposter-apps/)\nImitation is the highest form of flattery. If that’s true, we at Hiya should be thrilled to see so many apps in the App Store claiming to be Hiya. Somehow it doesn’t quite ring true though.\n\nImposter apps are looking for one thing: money. As such, they “build” fake apps, load them onto the App Store, charge money for them and then sit back and reap the financial benefits until Apple shuts them down. Then, they rinse and repeat with another app.\n\nIn Hiya’s case, we now have scammers scamming an anti-scam company. Consider the gauntlet thrown.\n\nHow can you tell if an app in the app store is an imposter?\n\nDeveloper name: Hiya’s developer name is Hiya. Simple! It should be recognizable or a name that you can easily look up and verify. Note: the developer name will not always match the app name (for example, Hiya also owns the Mr. Number app), but, with a little research, you should be able to confirm if the developer is indeed legitimate.\n\nWebsite: In the app store, we link toHiya’s Web Site and ourHiya Caller ID and Block Support page. Imposter apps will have links as well, however, they don’t function or will lead to a page that has nothing to do with the app.\n\nCost: Did you hear from a friend that Hiya is free? They were right! If you go into the App store and all of a sudden, you have to pay for a “free” app, you’re looking at an imposter.\n\nReviews: One of the most important tools at our fingertips. As fake apps are just that – fake, they will not function as they are supposed to. After paying $1.99 for an app and it doesn’t work, you can bet reviews will come in and they will not be pleasant. Take a look at the reviews. Sure, Hiya doesn’t get 5 star reviews all the time (nobody’s perfect…not yet, at least), but, we have a wide range of positive reviews from many users. Imposters will have only a few reviews and they will not be positive.\n\nImposters will receive a few, very bad reviews",
      "# [Amazon Scam Calls to Watch For | Hiya by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/amazon-scam)\nAmazon is in an enviable position of being a top retailer and having global brand recognition. The flip side of that, however, is that its notoriety makes it a prime target for scammers. Fraudsters making random robocalls have a good chance of reaching someone who has an Amazon account.\n\nAmazon has operations on five continents and has dedicated websites in 13 countries. It’s no wonder that Amazon phone scams are common in many countries, including\n\n#1 phone scam in Canada\n\n#1 phone scam in the UK\n\n#2 phone scam in the US\n\nHow do Amazon scam calls work?\n\nNo matter how hard you try to keep your phone number private, scammers have several tactics to obtain contact information. There are data brokers that find personal information online and sell it to third parties. Scammers can purchase this information and then contact you about your Amazon account. Scammers can also obtain any personal information that was leaked during a data breach.\n\nOnce they have your phone number, scammers make a call from an unknown number or one that was spoofed to appear as if it were coming from Amazon. The scammer then claims to be part of the Amazon customer support team calling about an issue with an order or a notice of a security breach. The scammer then attempts to gain your personal information (like your Amazon account username and password or credit card information) by claiming that this information is necessary to resolve the issue.\n\nSamples of Amazon scam calls\n\nBelow are transcripts of actual Amazon scam calls. These are from the Hiya honeypot: a collection of Hiya-owned phone numbers used to capture the content of scam and nuisance calls. Here is the wording of the three most common Amazon scam calls observed by Hiya:\n\n“Hello. This is Amazon. This call is to authorize a payment of $999. We would like to inform you that there is an order placed for an Apple iPhone 11 Pro using your Amazon account. If you do not authorize this order press 1, or press 2 to authorize this order.\n\n“This is a confirmation call from Amazon regarding your purchase of iPhone 13 Pro Max and Apple Airpods, totaling $1499. But we have found some suspicious activities in your account while processing the payment. So in order to cancel your order, kindly press 1 to speak with the Amazon fraud department.”\n\n“Hello. Amazon Express notice. A courier delivered twice and no one has signed for it. For details, please press 1.”\n\nEach call has a common element: the robocall asks the recipient to press a number, which will connect with a phony Amazon representative. Instead of wasting time making live calls, the scammers start with a robocall, and if the recipient falls for the scam and presses a number, a live operator will attempt to get the victim to reveal their Amazon account information or credit card number.\n\nReports from Hiya users\n\nIn addition to the honeypot, Hiya also receives user reports from consumers using Hiya Protect via their carrier, device manufacturer, or the Hiya mobile app. Here’s a sampling of the Amazon scam calls users are reporting:\n\n“Multiple calls from multiple numbers to convince me to let them help with a fraudulent purchase on Amazon.”\n\n“Claims to be from Amazon. Usually, a message that wants you to call them back about an order, then they try to pump you for information.”\n\n“Claiming to be Amazon to renew a monthly fee of $99 per month. If you speak to a consultant to cancel, they request your bank details to stop the payment.”\n\nHow to protect against scam calls\n\nCarriers can add Hiya Protect, a complete call protection solution that enables carriers to protect their subscribers by blocking and labeling spam calls, and helping them identify wanted calls. Hiya Protect recently added a new layer of protection, Personal AI, which personalizes call protection to individual subscribers so they receive the calls that are important to them and are protected from targeted attacks.\n\nWith Hiya Connect, enterprises can improve customer engagement and loyalty while protecting their customers from deceitful interactions and their brand reputation from inaccurate spam labeling.

If not, ask your carrier to consider adding Hiya Protect.",
      "# [What is enterprise branded call? Display a branded caller ID | Hiya by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/branded-call)\nWe’ve all had the experience of seeing an unknown number pop up on our phones. Without thinking, we answer the call, only to hear, “[car warranty scam beginning.]” The frustration we feel from this spam call, coupled with the frequency we experience it, leaves us with a sour taste in our mouths. It’s no wonder 87% of consumers believe unidentified calls may be fraudulent. And for call centers that regularly make outbound calls, this has detrimental effects.\n\nThat’s why branding your calls with your business name is so important. With a Branded Call, the caller ID displays a caller’s company name, location, logo, and other identifiable information before the call even starts. Instead of seeing “unknown caller” and worrying about the nuisance of a potential spam call, a Branded Call allows customers to identify and trust the source of a call immediately.\n\nLet your customers know you're calling. With branded caller ID, display your company name, logo, and location to engage with more people, faster.\n\nBenefits of enterprise branded caller ID\n\nAlthough agencies like the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are trying to use their resources to stop the exponential increase in spam calls, they’re simply aren't given enough to respond to the rapidly evolving scam tactics deployed by scammers.\n\nTrust\n\nWhen consumers cannot trust the calls coming from your business, it starts affecting their perception of your brand. Imagine you are waiting for a call from your food delivery service on the status of your order. Time goes by and you haven’t received an update. You’d be pretty frustrated and your confidence in the company would plummet. While the delivery driver could have been calling you all along, you didn’t answer the calls because you didn’t know who was calling. As more and more customers stop answering their phones for unidentified calls, this damaged reputation can snowball into massive losses as customers choose other delivery services.\n\nSecurity and spam\n\nFraudsters are always ready and willing to impersonate well-known companies—and with people more connected to their phones than ever before, telecom scams are their method of choice. But with Hiya’s Branded Call, by providing your company name and logo, you can assure your customers that your call is legitimate. Hiya also offers Secure Call, an additional feature that pre-authenticates outbound calls before they are made, securing your branded caller identity, and protecting your customers from falling victim to fraudsters using your numbers.\n\nBranding\n\nThe customer's experience of the call will influence whether they have a positive or negative perception of your business. A Branded Call will help create a visual experience that draws the customer in and increases their positive association with the business and its call center. Word of mouth is a powerful marketing vehicle, so it is important to remember that positive interactions often lead customers to spread the word.\n\nIncrease answer rates\n\nImagine you get two calls—one says “unknown number” and the other says a company’s name. Which one are you going to answer? Call centers with a branded caller ID through Hiya report an average 80% increase in answer rates. Customers pick up the phone when they know who’s calling.\n\nWhat are the risks of not having an enterprise branded caller ID?\n\nAt this point, you should be quite familiar with the fact that branded caller ID can improve the efforts of your contact center dramatically. But what are the risks associated with not having a Branded Call? Consider the following:\n\nUnanswered calls\n\nWhat do most people do when they encounter an unknown number? They ignore the call. According to Hiya's State of the Call survey, 84% of consumers think an unidentified call is fraudulent. As a result of being unable to communicate essential information to your customers, your company’s bottom line will suffer.\n\nThe challenges of unidentified calls\n\nIn today's digital age, trust is paramount. When a call comes in without a clear indicator of who is calling, many consumers hesitate to answer, fearing potential scams or unwanted solicitations. Imagine eagerly awaiting an update on your food delivery order. Minutes turn into hours, and there's no word. Your frustration mounts, and your trust in the service wanes. Unbeknownst to you, the delivery driver may have been trying to reach you, but their calls went unanswered because there was no clear indication of who was on the other end. This scenario is becoming increasingly common as more individuals opt to ignore unidentified calls. As this trend continues, businesses face the risk of eroding customer trust and loyalty, potentially leading to significant losses as customers turn to competitors with clearer communication channels.\n\nHow Hiya can help\n\nWant to know how you can brand your business name on your outbound calls? calling an iPhone or Android? Getting Hiya Connect can help you change your caller ID to accurately identify and increase your answer rates. The Branded Call feature helps call centers display their company name, logo, and reason for calling. This will help your business contact the right individuals while building trust in your brand. Hiya’s Voice Performance Platform also gives you the ability to:\n\nTrack the impact of Branded Call over time\n\nMonitor your caller reputation health\n\nUnderstand why calls have been blocked or reported\n\nSecure calls and prevent number hijacking",
      "# [You’re A Mean One Mr. Grinch…Or Should We Say Holiday Scammers by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/holiday-scammers/)\nThanksgiving may be over, but just because you put away your “Thanksgiving pants,” doesn’t mean you shouldn’t prepare yourself for the next wave of holiday madness coming your way.\n\nFrom online shopping to searching for holiday jobs to giving to the less fortunate, our good deeds are like a double-edged sword. Scammers have caught on to our holiday habits and are using it to their advantage but unfortunately, it’s also to our demise. Here are a few scams you should keep an eye out for this holiday season that will help you gain back the upper hand:\n\nCharity Scam\n\nThe holidays are a time for giving, and as we plan to make generous donations, you may have already been victim to a number of requests from a variety of “organizations”. Unfortunately, charity scams have seen a 50% increase from November 2015 to November 2016.\n\nScammers are disguising themselves as “charities” to take advantage of you while you’re in the giving spirit. They will either request personal or financial information (which legitimate charities will never ask for) and most likely a small percentage (if you’re lucky) or none of your donation will go to the cause you are trying to help.\n\nGift Card Scam\n\nWe’re all familiar with gift card scammers tricking us into paying past due bills and overdue taxes with gift cards but during the holiday season, it’s all about tricking us into selling them our unwanted gift cards.\n\nThere are a variety of gift card scams out there and because of them, it’s not a surprise that from October 2015 to October 2016, there was a 58.19% increase and from January 2016 to October 2016 alone there was a 43.21% increase in the scam.\n\nGift cards are a simple yet easy gift, but we don’t always get the ones we ask for. Just about everything sells online including gift cards and this holiday season we’re likely to do just that. When making an offer on a gift card, scammers will demand the seller confirm the balance on the card by calling the merchant on a three-way call. While the seller enters the gift card number, the scammer records the touch-tone numbers entered to intercept the gift card number. Then, scammers will use the gift card without paying for it. Make sure to sell unwanted gift cards to reputable gift card resellers, or to a gift card exchange kiosk (i.e. Coinstar.)\n\nHoliday (Vacation) Scam\n\nWho can resist a vacation, but even more who can resist a “FREE” holiday vacation! It’s apparent that the word “FREE’ has been getting the best of us since these types of scams have gone up 69% from October 2015 to November 2016.\n\nA majority of vacation scams start with a phone call promising an unbelievable prize from a raffle or survey you may (or may not) have entered. As you rack your brain wondering what you may have unknowingly entered, you can’t help but feel that what they’re offering is too good to be true. If you’re getting that gut feeling, it probably is.\n\nPackage Delivery Scam\n\nIt’s always a wonderful surprise to find a package from Uncle Bob or Aunt Sue on your front porch during the holiday season, but don’t let the flood of gifts catch you off-guard when you get a text telling you that you have a package “waiting” for you.\n\nThese types of “packages” can come as a notice claiming you’ve won a prize, or a SMiShing link that you’ve received a package and all you have to do is “click the link” to find the status of its delivery. Don’t fall for it! Scammers are taking advantage of your gift-receiving vulnerability to get you to click on links that will download software to help them steal your personal and financial information.\n\nOnline Shopping Scam\n\nWe know that despite it being the time of giving, gifts can add up. So, when we can find a killer deal on something, we tend to seize the opportunity. However, when these opportunities seem too good to be true, know that they usually are.\n\nFrom social media to Craigslist, scammers are reeling in victims with deals they know shoppers won’t want to miss. They request payment and before the buyer can receive what they’ve paid for, the seller has already run with their money before victims realize they’ve been had. Do your due diligence and shop from accredited stores or make sure you know who you’re wheeling and dealing with before you hand over your whole holiday budget.\n\nHoliday Employment\n\nUnfortunately, this doesn’t only happen during the holiday season but all year round. However, during the holidays, a number of us are looking to make some extra cash with seasonal jobs. Due to popular demand, scammers are creating fake job listings to swipe personal and financial information from unknowing job candidates by requesting social security numbers and bank account numbers and conducting fake background checks.\n\nIf you ever receive these types of calls or feel you’re being victimized, it’s best to hang up the phone and do some research on the organization. Call the organization directly to make sure that it is a legitimate business. If the call was a scam, report the call to the FCC.\n\nHappy Holidays!",

      "# [What Are Sales Optimization Best Practices? by Alicia Marie Beatty](https://blog.hiya.com/sales-optimizations)\nOptimizing your call performance strategy can be a difficult, arduous task--made even worse if your team is constantly hiring and training new agents. Many managers find it difficult to focus their team’s efforts on activities that will maximize revenue. We’ve been there, and we’re here to help.\n\nThe word “optimization” is used so frequently in business conversations that the meaning often becomes masked by other definitions. Managers will frequently, mistakenly use “optimize” in lieu of other, more appropriate words like “growth” or “high performance.” And though these definitions may appear to be quite similar, using the words interchangeably will cause your sales team to miss out on golden opportunities.\n\nIn this article, we’re taking a minute to break down what sales optimization really is, why it’s critical for your success, and how you can begin implementing best practices today.\n\nWhat Is Sales Optimization?\n\nSales optimization is the process of analyzing and improving sales performance to achieve maximum revenue. Good managers evaluate the performance of sales teams and provide training to help agents develop skills that lead to wins.\n\nOptimizations are important in every industry, but it especially applies to the work done in contact centers. Because outbound calls are so repetitive, it can be easy for agents to develop bad habits through lack of focus. Optimization occurs when agents consistently use best practices to increase the likelihood of closing sales.\n\nOptimization Best Practices\n\nThere are many things that contact centers can do to maximize their sales revenue. Here are three ways to take your optimization strategy to the next level:\n\n1. Set Long Term Goals\n\nSince sales optimization is all about choosing the most efficient path to success, it’s important to start by visualizing your end goal. Set goals based on yearly revenue and sales, and keep those goals top of mind.\n\nA common misstep: call center teams tend to focus more on short-term goals than they do on long-term goals. Weekly, monthly, and quarterly goals are only useful if they provide a clear path to achieving long-term business goals. Because sales optimization is all about adjusting performance over time, you’ll need to be careful to not get so focused on hitting this quarter’s numbers that you forget about the bigger picture.\n\nSome managers find it difficult to create lasting, measurable goals, instead opting for short-term goals that are easy to achieve. This is understandable, since long-term goals are usually more high-level and difficult to track. Although they are typically more difficult to track, long-term goals can be, and usually are, more closely aligned with the call center’s mission statement than short-term goals. However, it is impossible to optimize for long-term goals without having a way to measure performance metrics. In short, make sure your goals are tied to a measurable KPI that can be tracked. An example of this might be, ”increase sales by 13% by the end of Q3.” This example hits the sweet spot between setting a goal for your team without being prescriptive or restrictive about the ways in which they go about achieving that goal—creating focus, and allowing for innovation to discover new methods of optimization along the way.\n\n2. Use A Voice Performance Platform for Sales Optimization\n\nSales optimization platforms (like Hiya’s Voice Performance Platform) provide all the tools you need to successfully implement software sales strategies. With these tools for data collection and analysis (and, on a premiere software like Hiya, customized insights) you can stay on track for reaching your long-term goals. Good platforms will also include solutions to common problems call centers face, such as security, reputation management, audience analysis data, and more.\n\nWhen deciding on a voice performance platform, pay attention to what’s offered; is the software cloud-based? Does it contain fraud filters? And is the data self-service, on demand, and accessible 24/7? Sales optimization platforms that include these features can be far more valuable than standard, static caller registries, as they go beyond the basic information provided by your dialer. Choose a platform that will best meet your company’s needs and help you achieve your long-term goals.\n\n3. Make Data-Driven Decisions\n\nThe best sales processes always include an emphasis on tracking and analyzing data which allows managers to make decisions based on actionable insights. While everything up to this point has been important, this step is where the most tangible, significant results happen.\n\nMaking business decisions that are rooted in data does two things to your sales performance. First, it gives you an imperial metric to guide you in an industry that is all too frequently subjective. You can’t fool numbers. Second, it gives you a way to measure the efficacy of your initiatives. Many sales optimization platforms, such as Hiya’s Voice Performance Platform, will allow you to identify lead quality -- an invaluable resource for your agents. While it’s not an exact science, if your decisions aren’t backed by data and tracked in an organized manner, you’ll have no idea if an initiative is making an impact.\n\nAs you track your team’s performance, pay attention to trends in data. For example, if you notice a sudden drop in answer rates, it may be a sign that an imposter is spoofing your calls. No amount of training your agents will improve that metric. Once you’ve discovered a spoofing problem, you can take action by securing your calls and giving customers the confidence to answer. Fortunately, many sales optimization platforms, including Hiya Connect, can help notify you when problems like this arise and can solve them before they have a chance to negatively impact performance.\n\nUsing Hiya Connect for Sales Optimization\n\nHiya Connect, a Voice Performance Platform, is the industry-leading platform for performance analytics. Its intuitive dashboard integrates all of your metrics in one platform, allowing for a clear, comprehensive view of your performance. Hiya also provides data-driven insights to give you actionable steps to improve call performance. These are a few examples of how Hiya Connect can help you reach your optimization goals.\n\nCall centers may come across a sudden decline in answer rates, which may signify an imposter attempting to spoof your calls. Customers become conditioned to not pick up the phone anymore after they’ve received spam calls from numbers that look similar to your business numbers. Hiya Connect protects against spam labels and secures network connections, so you will never have to face this issue again.\n\nWhat if your answer rates were never high to begin with? Hiya Connect provides call centers with branded calls, which display your company name, logo, and a custom, informative reason for calling. Answer rates increase significantly when the prospect knows the identity of the caller.",
      "# [Evolution of Phones and its Affect on Society by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/telephone-transformation/)\nThe smartphones we possess today have come a long way from the first rendition of the telephone back in 1876 when Alexander Graham Bell invented and patented the first short-range phone. But like people, phones have evolved throughout history to cater to our lifestyles and needs.\n\nHere’s a look at how telephones have transformed over the years…\n\nShort-Range Phone: Despite a number of individuals from around the world who’ve contributed to the invention of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell was the first to receive a patent for his short-range phone in 1876. Testing out the phone in his Boston laboratory, he rang his assistant Thomas Watson, and become well known-for saying, “Mr. Watson, come here – I want to see you.”\n\nCandlestick Phone: The candlestick phone became popular in the 1890s through the 1930s. Separated by two pieces, it featured a mouth piece (transmitter) mounted at the top of the stand, and a receiver (ear phone) that the user would hold to their ear during a call.\n\nRotary Phone: Pushing out the candlestick phone, the rotary phone came about in the 1930s when manufacturers began to combine the mouth piece and receiver of the candlestick phones into a single unit. When dialing a rotary phone, what originally started as lugs, but evolved into holes, one would then rotate the dial to the number that they wanted and then would release the dial.\n\nTouch-Dial Phone: On November 18, 1963, the Bell System unveiled the first electronic touch-dial phone system with touch-tone dialing. It would become the worldwide standard for telecommunication signaling. Using audible tones for each of the digits on the push-button keypad, specific frequencies were designated to each row and column. The tones helped the switching center determine which key was pressed.\n\nFirst Mobile Phone: On April 3, 1973, Motorola researcher and executive, Martin Cooper, made the first mobile telephone from handheld subscriber equipment. Weighing in at 2.4 lbs and measuring at 228.6 x 127 x 44.4mm, Cooper was said to have called a rival telecommunications company and let them know he was talking to them on a mobile phone. The prototype was able to give a caller 30 minutes of talk-time and took about 10 hours to charge.\n\nCordless Phone: Cordless phones became a hot commodity in the 1980s but was originally invented by a female Jazz musician named Teri Pall in 1965. The handset cord of the telephone was replaced with a radio link. However, Teri’s invention would not hit the consumer market until a decade and a half later.\n\nFirst Portable Phone: Even though Martin Cooper invented the first mobile phone, the first portable mobile phone was the MicroTAC which was introduced in 1989 as “an innovative new “flip” design”, where the “mouthpiece” folded over the keypad, although the “mouthpiece” was actually located in the base of the phone, along with the ringer. Up until its release, most cellular phones were installed as car phones due to the inability to fit them into a jacket pocket.\n\nNokia: Through the mid-90s and into the early 2000s, Nokia mobile phones catered to consumers, with interchangeable faceplates, customizable designs, the first WAP browser, internal antenna, T9 Text messaging, and eventually an LCD screen and internet connectivity.\n\nFirst Camera Phone (Sanyo SCP-5300): Possessing the first camera phone, the U.S. finally adopted the Japanese trend in November 2002. The clunky clamshell design could capture photos at 640×480 pixels and had a basic flash, white balance control, self-timer, digital zoom, and various filters (sepia, black and white, and negative colors.)\n\nCrack-Berry (BlackBerry): Blackberry made waves with their popular RIM communication device in 2003 which possessed a phone, PDA, and e-mail system all in one hand-held phone. The term crack-berry came about when users constantly checked their e-mail and sent short messages through their device.\n\nSleek Mobile Design (Motorola Razr): First developed in 2003, the Motorola Razr hit it big when it was marketed as a fashion phone due to its sleek and thin profile. Over its four-year run, they sold over a 130 million phones and were named the best-selling clamshell phone in history.\n\nSmartphones: Dating back as far as 1997, it wasn’t until Japan became the first mobile market to popularize the smartphone in 1999. As BlackBerry, Palm, HTC, Windows Mobile, Samsung, Nokia, and Motorola made a name for themselves in the early 2000s, their smartphones had the capability to email, fax, and search the internet. As the smartphone craze escalated, cell phone manufacturers tested a number of functionalities that would help them capitalize on the new trend. From sliding, flipping, rotating, vertical, and even multiple keyboards, touchscreen smartphones made their way into the market which also introduce the stylus. However, the functionality these phones offered were still targeting more business users versus consumers.\n\nCue in iPhone 3G. The first of its kind, the original iPhone was the first touch-screen smartphone that was unveiled in June 2007. Apple’s take on the smartphone combines “multimedia functions with the same email and Web browsing features as all other smartphones previously had. It had a large color display with a capacitive digitizer, and its user interface was finally finger-friendly. And unlike phones before it, the iPhone had only one button on its face – the Home button – and three around its edges, two for volume up/down and one for power/standby.” reports the “The Evolution of the Smartphone” from PocketNow.\n\nToday, iPhone has paved the way for a number of other cell phone manufacturers to create their own version of the smartphones we love today. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg on how phones have evolved over history, but it’s apparent that as phones change, engineers will cater to the needs of consumers. What do you think the evolution of phones will come up with next?\n\nKeep on top of all the trends in Voice with Hiya's State of the Call report below.",

      "# [iPhone FAQ](https://www.hiya.com/faq-ios)\nGetting Started\n\nWhere can I learn more about using Hiya?\n\nYou can learn more at our Help Center here.\n\nHiya is not working correctly. What is one thing I can try before I try anything else? (The Fail Safe)\n\nThe fail-safe: Consider the fail-safe the app version of calling IT Support and them asking if you restarted your computer.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that when you uninstall the app, you will lose the numbers in your blocklist. With that said, use this as a last resort if you have an extensive blocklist. (“Save Blocklist” functionality is a popular request and we are looking into it for future updates).\n\nDisable Hiya in Settings\n\nForce-quit Settings\n\nUninstall Hiya\n\nRestart your device\n\nReinstall Hiya\n\nThe enable Hiya option in the iPhone settings is not working. What do I do?\n\nFirst, our latest update on iOS has experienced issues with enabling and/or updating. We have been in communication with Apple and this is a known bug. Apple offered a workaround that seems to work (and it doesn’t require an uninstall of Hiya which causes you to lose your blocklist). So, if you are experiencing issues after updating to the latest version, please try this:\n\nWait at least one hour after Hiya gets into a bad state. Reboot the phone, then try to enable Hiya again and it should correct itself.\n\nIf this doesn't work then try the fail-safe just above.\n\nMy Caller ID name is wrong. How do I change it?\n\nIf you notice your number is incorrectly labeled as spam, or you notice that wrong information is shown or missing from your own number or someone else’s or, if you would like to remove your information from our services altogether, please click here and we can help you.\n\nHow do I report inaccurate or offensive comments?\n\nIf your number has inaccurate or offensive comments please follow the steps on this linked form and we can look into getting them removed for you.\n\nI have been waiting for the activation code but have yet to receive it. What gives?\n\nWe use Facebook Account Kit for our SMS code verification. Unfortunately, we have no control over whether it works or not. With that said, we want it to work as much as you do. Here are a few tips that may help:\n\nTry the fail-safe (noted at the top of the article).\n\nMake sure you have “United States (+1)” selected (assuming your phone is, indeed, a U.S. number)\n\nOnly use numbers, don’t start with 1 or +1\n\nEnsure your device is subscribed to a texting plan and can receive short-code messages. This one sounds obvious, but we’ve had a few instances where users (and even one of our own developers!) had short-code text messages auto-disabled through their carrier. If you aren’t receiving activation codes, it is worth a call to your carrier to ensure you’re supported.\n\nCall Blocking\n\nHow can I block Spoofed Calls / Neighbor Scam (calls that show as my area code and prefix) on Hiya?\n\nThere is a way to block spoofed calls in the iPhone app. In the Hiya app, tap on options in the bottom right, then scroll down to the Spoofed Calls / Neighbor Scam option and choose block. You can also choose to alert instead of block.\n\nPlease be aware that the block option will block all calls with your area code and your prefix. Even those in your contact list. This is something that we will fix in the next release in the next couple of weeks. In the meantime, the alert option is probably your best bet.\n\nWhy is the iPhone app blocking a contact from calling me?\n\nDo you have a contact in your iPhone that is blocked from calling you and you're not sure why? You might have to change a setting to fix it.\n\nIn the Hiya app, tap on Options in the bottom right, then scroll down to the Spoofed Calls / Neighbor Scam option and choose Alert or Do Nothing. The block option for spoofed calls will block all calls with your area code and your prefix. Even those in your contact list. This is something that we will fix in our next iPhone release. In the meantime, the alert option is probably the best bet.\n\nIs there a way to prevent blocked calls from going to voicemail?\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot prevent blocked calls from going to voicemail. This is a limitation from Apple that prevents us from hanging up on blocked calls. As soon as Apple lifts this limitation, we will eagerly make it available. We want to hang up on them as well.\n\nIs there a way to see calls that have been blocked?\n\nUnfortunately, not. This is another implementation detail from Apple that we can’t work around (we can provide a blocked calls list with Android). We have no idea why we can’t have a “Hey! We’re awesome and here’s a list of calls we’ve blocked for you” section somewhere. The day that changes is the day you’ll see it.\n\nIs there any way to block all unknown caller ID/private callers?\n\nUnfortunately, there’s no way to block all unknown callers, in the app or iPhone itself. We can only block an actual number that is recognized by caller ID. Android has some cool features like block by area code, but at this time, we can’t provide that feature on iPhone.\n\nIn iOS is there a way to import or export the block list after un/reinstalling?\n\nWe don’t have a “save block list” function right now… However, it is a popular request so we are looking into it.\n\nProtection\n\nHow do I use Hiya to look up unknown numbers?\n\nFirst copy the unknown number from your Recents within the Phone application and then open Hiya. Hiya will ask you if you want to identify the number you just copied. Tap “yes” and Hiya will look up the number for you.\n\nWhat are the steps for copying phone numbers?\n\nTo copy a phone number, go to your Recent calls within the iPhone Phone application and tap on the info icon (the “i” with a circle around it) for the number you wish to look up. Once you’re on the contact card, press the caller's number and hold it for a couple seconds. The option to copy the number will appear. Tap “Copy” and the number is ready for you to paste into other apps.\n\nHow do I look up numbers with the widget (iOS 8 and above only)?\n\nFirst install the Hiya widget. To install the widget, pull down the Notification Center. Make sure you are on the “Today” tab. Scroll to the bottom and tap “Edit.” You will be shown a list of apps that have widgets available. Tap on Hiya to add the widget.\n\nNext, copy the number you want to look up from your Recent Call Log. Pull down the Notification Center and scroll to the Hiya widget. The phone number will be automatically identified there.\n\nHow does Hiya identify incoming scam and spam calls?\n\nHiya adds an address book entry containing hundreds of phone numbers for known-to-be spammers and scammers. Because scammers and spammers are constantly changing their phone numbers to avoid detection, we update our entries at least once a day, often more.\n\nWhy does an inbound call not get marked as spam, even if Hiya reports show it as a spam number?\n\nThere are a few things here.\n\n#1) Our database of spammers is gigantic. Unfortunately, we are not able to enter every single spam number in the world into CallKit. We have to be picky and so we choose only the spam numbers that we have the highest confidence in to ID on the incoming call. For the remaining numbers, sometimes you’ll have to manually look them up in the app to see if they are Suspected Spam or not.\n\n#2) When a call comes in, we look up the number to see if it’s spam. Usually, it takes less than one second, but sometimes it simply takes longer and calls can get through.\n\nI have installed the app, but so far no calls have been identified….?\n\nIf calls are not being identified at all when you get them, then something has probably gone wrong. A simple check is to see if any calls are identified in the native phone call log. You should see some Hiya entries in there if it’s working.\n\nIf not, revert to the fail-safe (see above) and then, go back into the app, in the Call Protection tab, click on “Update Now” and give it about a minute to update, then check the call log again.\n\nAre spam numbers updated in the background or do I have to manually launch the app occasionally to update?\n\nIf you enable Hiya (through the phone's Settings> Phone> Call Blocking and Identification), then our spam lists will update in the background. Leading to our next ever-popular question…\n\nI enabled Hiya in the phone's settings, why does the app continually tell me I need to go in and update (by showing a red dot on the app icon)?\n\nAnytime the spam list updates, you will receive a badge notification on the Hiya icon. This is to let you know that it’s working and updating. If you prefer not to see this, you can disable badge icons in your Settings (the spam lists will still continue to update, you just won’t be notified as such).\n\nTo disable badge icons follow these steps: Go into your settings for the iPhone itself. Go to Settings> Notifications> Hiya> and then disable “Badge App Icon.”\n\nWhy do the number of scam and spam calls I am protected from keep changing?\n\nScammers and spammers are constantly changing their phone numbers to avoid being blocked by our app. We update the lists of scammers and spammers at least once a day, as long as the app is active to ensure that you stay protected from unwanted calls. Typically a scammer's number will only be active for 2-5 days before it is shut down by it's own provider. When a number is shutdown and deactivated we take it off of the total blocked list.\n\nWhat is the difference between scam calls, spam calls and blacklisted calls?\n\nScams are calls trying to get you to send them money or are found to be fraud in some other way. Spam calls are calls from telemarketers, bill collectors, solicitors, etc. Spam is not dangerous, but can be very annoying. Blacklisted calls are from numbers that you choose to blacklist because you want them blocked. This is someone such as an ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend or anyone you just don’t want to talk to.\n\nHow do I use the spam check dialer?\n\nGo to the “Call” tab in the app and type in the phone number you want to dial. If no spam is detected, then the call will go through. If the number you are dialing is identified as spam, you will be warned and asked if you want to continue with the call.\n\nDoes the “real-time” notification only work over wifi or 3g?\n\nHiya doesn’t require any network connection; if you can receive a phone call, it works! You will only need a connection to update the Spam numbers list.\n\nPrivacy\n\nWhy do you need access to my contacts?\n\nUpon signing up for Hiya, you agree to share your contacts, but we keep all contact data private and don’t sell it to third parties or use it to market to your contacts. Because we’re not awful human beings. More information can be found here.\n\nIs giving you access to my contact list still necessary?\n\nFor full functionality, yes. We use it for the smart dialer, to autocomplete suggestions, to whitelist spam functionality, for sharing functionality and for adding to block list functionality. With that said, you don’t have to grant contacts permission, but the app will have some limited operation.\n\nDo you have access to my call logs on the iPhone?\n\nWe do not have access to call logs on the iPhone.\n\nHow do you keep contact information private if you use Facebook?\n\nFacebook is used only for login, it’s optional, and nothing is shared with Facebook. Facebook AccountKit is used for phone verification. It does not require a Facebook account, it only verifies the phone number.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nHiya is still not working correctly. What is one thing I can try after I try have tried everything else? (The Fail Safe)\n\nThe fail-safe: Consider the fail-safe the app version of calling IT Support and them asking if you restarted your computer.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that when you uninstall the app, you will lose the numbers in your blocklist. With that said, use this as a last resort if you have an extensive blocklist. (“Save Blocklist” functionality is a popular request and we are looking into it for future updates).\n\nDisable Hiya in Settings\n\nForce-quit Settings\n\nUninstall Hiya\n\nRestart your device\n\nReinstall Hiya\n\nI have been waiting for the activation code but have yet to receive it. What gives?\n\nWe use Facebook Account Kit for our SMS code verification. Unfortunately, we have no control over whether it works or not. With that said, we want it to work as much as you do. Here are a few tips that may help:\n\nTry the fail-safe (noted at the top of the article).\n\nMake sure you have “United States (+1)” selected (assuming your phone is, indeed, a U.S. number)\n\nOnly use numbers, don’t start with 1 or +1\n\nEnsure your device is subscribed to a texting plan and can receive short-code messages. This one sounds obvious, but we’ve had a few instances where users (and even one of our own developers!) had short-code text messages auto-disabled through their carrier. If you aren’t receiving activation codes, it is worth a call to your carrier to ensure you’re supported.\n\nWhy am I not seeing “Hiya” in Settings>Phone>Call Blocking & Identification?\n\nFirst, our latest update on iOS has experienced issues with enabling and/or updating. We have been in communication with Apple and this is a known bug. Apple offered a workaround that seems to work (and it doesn’t require an uninstall of Hiya which causes you to lose your blocklist). So, if you are experiencing issues after updating to the latest version, please try this:\n\nWait more than one hour after Hiya gets into a bad state. Reboot the phone, then try to enable Hiya again and it should correct itself.\n\nIf this doesn't work then try the fail-safe at the beginning of the FAQ.\n\nHow do you uninstall Hiya?\n\nTo remove Hiya from your iPhone:\n\nOpen the app and tap \"Protect\" at the bottom.\n\nTap the \"Enable Call Protection\" slider so that Call Protection is disabled. This will remove the \"Suspected Spam\", \"Scam or Fraud\", and \"Blacklisted\" contacts that the app uses for Spam/Scam identification.\n\nExit the app and long-press the app icon.\n\nAn \"x\" will appear in one corner. Tap the \"x\" to completely uninstall.\n\nI've uninstalled Hiya but why do calls still seem to be getting blocked?\n\nIf you are still having issues after uninstalling Hiya you might have to reinstall the app and then try these steps:\n\nDisable Hiya in the iPhone Settings (Settings->Phone->Call Blocking & Identification)\n\nForce-quit Settings\n\nUninstall Hiya\n\nRestart your device\n\nThe Hiya widget doesn’t appear as a choice on Notifications.\n\nIf you’ve already tried the fail-safe (see above), let’s give this a whirl instead: Pull down the notification center by swiping down from the top of the screen. Swipe right to bring up the widgets page, scroll to the bottom. Tap the circular “edit” button, and tap the “+” button next to Hiya.\n\nHelp\n\nHow can I give feedback?\n\nWe'd love to hear from you. Click here to contact us.\n\nHow do I contact support?",
      "# [KPI Tracking for Contact Centers by Alicia Marie Beatty](https://blog.hiya.com/kpi-tracking)\nRunning a call center without tracking your performance is like running a business without keeping track of revenue. Seeing how well your call center is performing is critical to success and your ability to communicate that success.\n\nKey performance indicators (KPIs) are a series of metrics that are designed to measure the overall performance of a company. KPI tracking is the process of regularly gathering, organizing, analyzing, and reporting these metrics to achieve business objectives. Specific KPIs vary from industry to industry, but tracking KPIs is a valuable practice no matter what business you are in.\n\nContact centers especially benefit from tracking KPIs. We’ve already covered the 15 Key Call Center Metrics we recommend all call centers track, so in this article, we will break down the process of how to track these KPIs, and why you should be constantly monitoring them. We’ll also lay out some important tools that are fundamental to your KPI tracking success.\n\nStep 1: Determine your KPIs\n\nYour first task is to choose which KPIs you are going to monitor. Here are some key characteristics to consider when choosing effective KPIs:\n\nMeasurable\n\nA good KPI is a metric that is simple and easy to measure. Because these are going to be tracked over time, your KPIs should have numbers attached to them. The meaning of each of these numbers should be clear enough that they don’t need to be explained; a new employee working at your contact center should be able to quickly understand what each KPI represents.\n\nTry to avoid picking things that are difficult to measure or have no clear quantitative value. For example, a KPI tracking meaningful interactions between agents and prospects, while incredibly valuable, is a difficult thing to track. Oftentimes when KPIs are hard to measure, they end up not getting measured, and quickly fall out of focus.\n\nPerformance Driven\n\nPerformance is an essential component of Key Performance Indicators. That being said, make sure the KPIs you choose are measuring indicators that lie within your control. It will be challenging for you to determine exactly how you can improve if you only measure things that are outside of your control. Likewise, placing the responsibility of performance on your agents, rather than on your prospects, can be motivating and reduce frustration.\n\nBe sure as well that each of your KPIs measures a single aspect of your performance. This is important because once you start tracking them, it will be easier to make actionable insights if you know that a low-performing KPI can be improved by dialing in on that single performance aspect.\n\nRelated to Business Objective\n\nKPI tracking is all about focusing on what metrics bring the most success, and working to improve the performance of those metrics. Tracking KPIs is useless, however, if it doesn’t help you achieve your business objectives. As a contact center, you’ll need to choose KPIs that directly influence the vision of your company.\n\nA common mistake call centers that are beginning to dig into data will make is focusing too much on metrics that are tangential to their mission. As you determine which KPIs to monitor, ask yourselves, “How will improving this metric move our company’s vision forward?”\n\nExamples of effective KPIs\n\nAs you consider which KPIs to track, notice how each of these metrics are measurable, performance-driven, and relate to a call center’s business objective:\n\nStep 2: Analyze your Current Performance\n\nOnce you’ve chosen your KPIs, the next step in setting up effective KPI tracking is to analyze how you are performing for each metric. If you haven’t been doing any kind of monitoring, then begin tracking your performance and use the next month to establish a baseline.\n\nIf you do have historical data to go off of, spend some time digging through it to establish where your agents’ performance has been. Use broad strokes when analyzing your current performance; we’re focused on trends over time, rather than random spikes in performance. The goal of this exercise is to inform your KPI goals so that you’re not just taking a shot in the dark.\n\nStep 3: Set Clear, Measurable Goals\n\nKPI monitoring can be a powerful tool to motivate employees to work their hardest, especially if there is a clear goal those KPIs are trying to achieve. Set goals for each KPI that are measurable and time-bound. For example, you may set a goal to increase your average daily calls handled by 10% in Q3.\n\nThere are two types of goals that are helpful to consider when tracking KPIs:\n\nLong-Term Goals\n\nAt this point, you should have chosen KPIs that align perfectly with your contact center’s overarching business objectives. Company visions are high-level and often difficult to quantify. Setting long-term goals for each of these metrics will give you a measurable companion to each objective. We recommend setting long-term goals for every year.\n\nShort-Term Goals\n\nSetting short-term goals break down your long-term goals into bite-sized chunks that are easier to manage and less overwhelming. Short-term goals can last a quarter, a week, or on rare occasions, a single day. We recommend starting with setting a short-term goal for the next three months.\n\nWhile it is useful to break down your long-term goals to inform your short-term goals, it’s also important to be realistic in what you and your team can achieve. You may need to adjust your short-term goals to be more attainable. The key here is to always be improving performance; the improvement doesn’t necessarily have to be astronomical.\n\nStep 4: Set up a KPI Performance Dashboard\n\nThis is possibly the most practical and useful step in the KPI tracking process. A KPI performance dashboard is a central hub that measures, tracks, and displays all of your key performance indicators in one place. The benefit of using a KPI dashboard is that it allows you to do a quick check-in to see how you’re performing across a variety of metrics.\n\nThere’s a variety of software out there that provides call centers with KPI performance dashboards. Hiya Connect Console is our all-in-one solution for monitoring, analyzing, and reporting key performance metrics. Our dashboards are chock full of industry-standard KPIs that give you both high-level and close-up views of how your call center is performing.\n\nHiya Connect analyzes and updates your company-wide performance daily, and displays key insights for you to make informed, actionable decisions. It also tracks your data over time and provides information for how your performance is trending, so you know exactly how close you are to achieving your long-term goals.\n\nStep 5: Set up Regular Reporting\n\nAnother important step to establishing KPI tracking is clearly communicating the reporting process to your team. Set up a regular reporting process to communicate which KPIs you’re tracking as a company. Make sure everyone knows the short-term and long-term goals your team is working towards. Decide whose responsibility it is to pull the reports, and who they should report to, then give them a frequent schedule so they have a deadline.\n\nWhile creating a report is simple enough for a single team member to be in charge of, KPI tracking as a whole is a team responsibility. Display your metrics in a place where everyone can see them, so each team member understands how they are contributing to the progress of short-term goals.\n\nThe frequency of your KPI reporting should be determined by the length of your short-term goals. Weekly reporting is a common method to keep performance top-of-mind while still giving room to breathe. Make sure that your KPI performance dashboard software provides a quick and easy way to pull reports, so you don’t waste too much time on this step.\n\nStep 6: Be Adaptable\n\nAs you begin the regular process KPI monitoring, you’ll begin to notice trends in how your call center is performing. Sometimes it can be discouraging when you don’t see improvement right away. Be flexible with your voice performance strategy, and be willing to adapt your plan to target the metrics that will produce the most valuable results.\n\nOne important benefit of KPI tracking is that you can use your performance data to make informed decisions. For example, you may find that after emphasizing a metric like average handle time for several months, you’re still unable to increase your customer satisfaction levels. At that point, you should consider adapting your strategy to emphasize a different metric, like first call resolution.\n\nAlways remember that your most important metric is whether or not you’re achieving your business objectives. If your short-term and long-term goals aren’t having any effect on achieving your business objectives, it may be time to reevaluate and switch it up.\n\nSummary\n\nGathering, analyzing, and reporting KPIs is an invaluable process that every call center needs to implement in order to see real performance growth. Your growth is driven by choosing the right metrics to measure, and aligning those KPIs with your business objectives. Remember that the best measurement of a contact center’s success is how well it serves the people on the other end of the line.",
      "# [Get your questions about Spam answered](https://work.hiya.com/why-spam)\nCommon questions we hear:\n\nWhy is my businesses phone number showing up as spam?\n\nSpam labels are applied by carriers who want to protect you from scam and spam calls.\n\nIf the data shows that your calls are unwanted by your recipients, either through high abandon rates, blocks, or being reported as spam (among other datapoints), your calls are more likely to be delivered with a “spam likely” label. Mobile carriers are constantly monitoring additional datapoints, working to fight the ever evolving scam tactics used by spammers and scammers.\n\nHow can I check if my outbound caller id is showing as spam?\n\nUse a service like Hiya’s Cross Carrier Call Inspection to see how your calls are displayed across carriers and devices. If you are ready to check your numbers, fill out the form below and our team will reach out to get a list of numbers to perform the audit.\n\nSome businesses do use a revolving door of phone numbers, rotating through them to attempt to evade these labels, rather than understanding the call practices that led to this labeling in the first place. If you think your phone numbers are showing up as spam, a call inspection is the first step. Then Hiya can guide you through the next steps in getting your calls delivered with an identity that matches your business.\n\nHow often do people answer calls with a spam identity?\n\nIn short: they don’t. And as nuisance calls increase in frequency, the likelihood of someone answering a spam or unidentified number is plummeting.\n\nEven without a spam label, 87% of consumers think an unidentified number may be fraudulent. And if a consumer receives a call impersonating your business, 73% of consumers struggle to trust that business ever again.\n\nWhy is Hiya different?\n\nWe work with our customers to ensure that they are prepared to get the most out of their voice channel today, and far into the future.\n\nWe also work directly with the carriers to understand the future of best call practices, and ensure our customers are acting on these long term plans for getting their calls answered. Unlike competitors, we know services like number rotation or spam mitigation isn't a long term solution. Having a branded identity on your calls alongside good call practices are the only way to build trust over the voice channel and get your calls answered again.",

      "# [Hiya for Businesses](https://www.hiya.com/solutions/businesses)\nProtect your personal device\n\nJoin over 5 million people identifying the calls they want to take and blocking the numbers they want to avoid with the highly-rated Hiya mobile app",
      "# [Senior Scam: Spoofing the Greatest Generation by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/elderly-scam)\nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), older adults (those 60 and older) are the least likely of any age group to report losing money to fraud, but when they do experience fraud with higher losses than adults aged 20-59.\n\nThat was one of the findings in Protecting Older Consumers: A Report of the FTC, which highlights findings from the agency’s fraud reports showing trends in how older adults are being affected by fraud.\n\nThe FTC tracks popular scams and regularly issues warnings of current scams to avoid. Several of the most popular are scams that specifically target older adults. Here are three of them:\n\nMedicare scams – There are a variety of Medicare scams out there. A common one is a call from a scammer who tells the recipient they need to replace their Medicare card. In order to do so, the scammer asks for their current Medicare number, which can then be used to bill false services to Medicare. The FTC warns, “Even if your Caller ID says it's Medicare, it could be faked.” Learn more.\n\nGrandparent scams – With this scam, the fraudster calls an older person pretending to be their grandchild. The grandchild says he or she is in jail (or some other legal trouble) and needs bail immediately. The grandparent is directed to wire transfer money to get the child out of jail — and to keep it secret from mom and dad. Learn more.\n\nSocial Security scams – With this scam, the caller tells victims that their Social Security benefits will end or their Social Security number will be suspended unless they pay immediately. Often they’ll request payment via wire transfer, cryptocurrency, or even gift cards. They may even threaten the victim, saying they’ll be arrested if they don’t pay. The scammer could be seeking money, personal information, or both. Learn more.\n\nWhat’s the solution to stop these illegal calls? This is what the FTC recommends:\n\n“Just hang up the phone on unwanted calls. Consider call-blocking services to reduce the number of unwanted calls you get. Ask your phone carrier about call blocking.”\n\nIf you’re a phone carrier and you don’t currently offer spam and fraud call blocking services, consider Hiya Protect. Hiya Protect detects spam and fraud calls with high accuracy, without blocking important calls. It is used by phone carriers, mobile phone manufacturers, and network providers who are looking to create a differentiated voice offering and increase customer satisfaction."

      "# Post ID 1763egw: Experience With \"Hiya\" Spam Call Protection - Critical/Important Calls Getting Blocked with +10 score by [(andrewhahalee, Reddit, 2023-10-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1763egw/experience_with_hiya_spam_call_protection/)\nJust wanna share an experience I had today:\n\nI  missed my package from my postal service twice today because \"Hiya\"  autoblocked all incoming calls from it without my knowledge. I wouldn't  have known if I hadn't gone into \"blocked calls\" on my S23 Ultra to have  a look after receiving a text notif informing me that attempts made to  reach my by my postal service had failed multiple times today.\n\nI  was hoping - like \"Spam Protection\" on my secondary Pixel device (which  was more efficient) - Samsung's spam call service would at least let it  ring with a \"Suspected Spam\" floating message then give me the option  to answer, reject or block instead of autoblocking. As far as memory  services, this is the first time I'm receiving a call from my postal  service so I hadn't done any prior settings to block it to begin with.\n\nI  don't know how it determines what is spam and what isn't. But it would  be scary to think one day somebody might be in a situation where an  emergency scenario at home occurred and Hiya autoblocks all incoming calls from a family member without the user's knowledge.\n\n## Comment ID k4jlbf5 with +4 score by [(I2iSTUDIOS, Reddit, 2023-10-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1763egw/experience_with_hiya_spam_call_protection/k4jlbf5/) (in reply to ID 1763egw):\nChange the settings to what you desire.

They are a glass repair company. Sometimes they have to ring a customer back to schedule a job or quote/confirm things etc. \n\nRecently it seems Hiya (suspected as it seems to be mainly Samsung phones) has blanket marking nearly all my customer's calls as SPAM. Meaning that THEIR clients don't answer their phones and miss appointments or thinks no-one ever calls them back etc, when instead the calls have silently dropped into their spam basket.\n\nThen I found this article:\n\n[https://commsrisk.com/big-us-call-analytics-firms-hiya-and-tns-blasted-for-conflict-of-interest-over-incorrect-spam-labels/](https://commsrisk.com/big-us-call-analytics-firms-hiya-and-tns-blasted-for-conflict-of-interest-over-incorrect-spam-labels/)\n\nHiya were very proud to announce their use of AI here to classify numbers as spam or not: \n\n[https://www.geekwire.com/2021/spam-smackdown-hiya-claims-massive-step-forward-using-ai-against-illegal-phone-calls/](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/spam-smackdown-hiya-claims-massive-step-forward-using-ai-against-illegal-phone-calls/)\n\nSeems Hiya and services like it may be making a big mess, (or doing it on purpose?) then getting businesses to contact them to clear the numbers from being marked as spam. I'm not sure whether they charge to clear legit number from their database but they have paid tiers so maybe it's just to get a point of contact to the business to try to convince them to buy their product. I won't speculate but it seems possible.\n\nIn any case thanks to the tardy way these services operate (and there's a few of them I'm just suspecting Hiya as it seems to be happening mostly on Samsung phones (that use Hiya)), I have a customer losing their customers and costing them money hand over fist.\n\nI believe services such as this CAN be beneficial for sure but when they get to choose who receives phone calls from whom based on AI without any confirmation about the numbers in question it's like holding numbers to hostage?\n\nIn any case. Big headaches for me and my clients and I hope some authority steps in soon to streamline the system and prevent legit numbers from getting blocked as it can literally ruin a business!\n\n### Comment ID l1kxjs1 with +1 score by [(Fresh_computer_smell, Reddit, 2024-04-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1763egw/experience_with_hiya_spam_call_protection/l1kxjs1/) (in reply to ID kubcwsz):\nThis is a great article.

Currently there are around 120+ tracks with my vocals on :)\n\n- In 2015, I won the Best Newcomer MC in the Drum and Bass Arena Awards.\n\n- I've been nominated every year since then, for Best MC, in the same awards and in 2019, I came second.\n\n- I've won the Czech and Slovak Drum and Bass Awards for nine years in a row as Best International MC.\n\n- Recently, I won Best MC National at the German Drum and Bass Awards and also Best Track National.\n\n- Fun fact: I am a Gemini who has never ever been on a roller coaster in my life because I'm totally scared of heights.\n\n- I have a small dog called Billy. He's a monster but I love him to piece\n\nCareer highlights:\n\n- I've worked across 39 countries worldwide.\n\n- Outside of dnb i´ve performed with artists like Kruder & Dorfmeister, Stereotyp and Felix de Housecat and many more\n\n- Opened a concert for Missy Elliott in Kuala Lumper, Malaysia\n\n- Toured China with Don Roobles of Kitachi (Iration Steppers)\n\n\n\n  \nHere are some links to my latest work and social media:\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/coppaworld](https://www.instagram.com/coppaworld)\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/artist/0rkBb19hZKPCrXugecfokF?si=k9dmsm7ORn2xjrEFsHsFEQ](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0rkBb19hZKPCrXugecfokF?si=k9dmsm7ORn2xjrEFsHsFEQ)\n\n[https://soundcloud.com/coppakid](https://soundcloud.com/coppakid)\n\n [www.mccoppa.co.uk](http://www.mccoppa.co.uk)\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/marvin.c.hay](https://www.facebook.com/marvin.c.hay)\n\n\n\nI’ll be here live answering your questions for the next few hours, so please feel free to ask me anything!\n\n  \nBigups!\n\nCop!\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID leptjfl with +13 score by [(lefuniname, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/leptjfl/) (in reply to ID 1eb34l9):\nHey Marvin, thanks for doing this!!

For me writing is writing - it all starts with a main theme,  then i´ll find an different way to approach it. Like for example  \"Pocket full of Drops\" (with Telekinesis) - the whole theme of that is using the metaphor of dealing out music & dubs like \"slinging dope\".  \n\n\"If you´re a bass (free-base rock/crack) fiend, we got the D (Diesel - old-school slang for heroin but also power fuel) we supplying it\" \n\n- i just enjoy writing and just literally having fun with it and creating imagery which goes with the feel of the music is what i consider the real art of it. I like to reference things that i like and inject my personality into the lyrics. Different style of dnb obviously bring out different sides of me.\n\nIn my other music or my dnb personal projects i´m more involved with the production process as far as the composition, topline melodies and arrangements of the ideas (mainly with my music partner Tommy) before they get the producer, but for dnb as far as external collabs go - most of the time i receive already full solid track ideas - so there's no need for it. I bring the vocal sauce to the pot :)\n\n## Comment ID lerg6p6 with +8 score by [(coppaworld174, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/lerg6p6/) (in reply to ID 1eb34l9):\nSo!

My question is: are those some teasers of something that may happen in the future or are those just some freestyles that you are not going to release? I've always found interesting your style, cause to me it's like you are doing hip hop on a drum and bass beat, that's why i also think your tracks are so likeable and easy to connect with.\n\n### Comment ID leqtvir with +5 score by [(coppaworld174, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/leqtvir/) (in reply to ID lepsv59):\nHeya!

Some are good and sparing with their words, some are incessant and to be honest, shit. I recently left Brixton Bass just after midnight because of them. \n\nI’ve just got tickets to drum and bass classics in late August and they’ve got a separate arena with no MC’s at all “let the music speak for itself” is the tag line. \n\nI go back to a time before MC’s, so what do you think can be done for those who simply aren’t too keen on them, because sometimes it’s impossible to get away from them.\n\n### Comment ID ler781a with +4 score by [(coppaworld174, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/ler781a/) (in reply to ID leq4s3h):\nHey mate, well.... i FEEL you so much on this point. As an MC myself its really quite difficult because i totally understand what you talking about. Its not like i have ears immune to this kind of thing myself, its just a shame that it reflects bad on the actual artform as a whole and those of us who take it seriously. Obviously i wasnt there or can comment on your recent experience but it seems like its not an uncommon one.\n\nObviously your never going to please EVERY member of a crowd as an MC but i do feel that if you are holding the microphone you should have enough self-awareness to understand when you are getting in the way or stopping people from enjoying the music. For me personally, i am there because i enjoy the music aswell and therefore i want to hear the music and enjoy the music with everyone else there, thats the whole point no? I know what my voice sounds like and as much as i enjoy hearing it, thats not the focus of why i´m there. I can chat in the shower to myself all day if i wanted lol but the thing is... and this might give you a little insight, is sometimes hearing yourself and holding the microphone can be a kind of a \"power trip\" for people, its sad to say but its kinda true... but with great power, comes great responsibility - but that part is not read in the handbook for mc-ing.\n\nAlso its alot easier to pass as an \"MC\" then it is as DJ because the audible clanging would stop the party instantly but vocal clanging seems to be more tolerated but at the expense of the ravers/punters. I think its not an MC-issue per say but a promoter issue for letting people on the microphone who might not have the professionalism, composure and experience yet to step up to that responsibility. And in the end, the ravers/punters lose out and also the MC´s who work  really hard and respect the craft also because it perpetuates MC-Bashing culture and turns regular people into people that \"dont like MCs\"\n\nI feel ya mate, and only wish there was a license for this - that you had to apply for to pass the MC-Test.  I think selecting nights with certain MCs who are in control of the microphone or picking nights that dont have MC´s or MC free-rooms is the easiest solution in the time being.\n\n#### Comment ID lericwo with +2 score by [(blimeyitsme, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/lericwo/) (in reply to ID ler781a):\nHey Marvin \n\nThanks for a great, lengthy and very well considered reply, I really appreciate it. \n\nI’ve not heard you at a club (yet) but just reading your understanding from my point of view (and of course your own experience), I reckon you’d be an MC I’d enjoy. \n\nIt may not have sounded like it, but I do actually enjoy some and I didn’t mean to shit on your talent at all. I like the idea of passing an MC test! To be honest, a shit DJ who can’t mix won’t get booked again, so why isn’t it the same for MC’s? that would just leave the very good ones!\n\nI suppose it can be quite cliquey and most certainly a power trip for some, as if they’re the main attraction. \n\nIt’s a contentious issue in this sub, MC’s are typically the marmite of dnb, you either love it or hate it, but this reply was about as good as it gets. \n\nThanks again and all the best from a 50 year old DJ who’s been up and coming for the last 34 years. 👍🏻\n\n### Comment ID leqqgg9 with +3 score by [(OccasionllyAsleep, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/1eb34l9/hiya_folks_my_name_is_marvin_also_known_as_coppa/leqqgg9/) (in reply to ID leq4s3h):\nI take it in strides like any other show or genre.

The design and paint scheme are wonderfully done but as with many collectible figures that have wonderful designs..impractical. \n\nFor me the overall figure was fairly floppy, but I didn’t expect much from such a design, it’s top heavy. The stand it comes with is cheap but works for the most part. \n\nSadly the figure suffers the typical ball joint socket issue because I couldn’t get the tails to connect into the holes..ever.

ChiaoGoo are my favorites hands down. They have sharp points that I like for lace. I haven't had too much trouble with the joins or with yarn catching. I did have one cable come out but I think it was my fault. It was a hot day and I tugged on them when the needle was stuck under something. (I tend to have a project in my car at all times so the heat got to it.) HiyaHiya are nice as well. Some people have had problems with the case because the needles aren't super secure. The join is nice but my yarn catches on part of the cable near the join. There is a little bump there on some of them. KnitPicks are affordable and pretty decent. They were my first set. I still use them frequently. The join comes undone if you don't use the key to tighten it. Don't think I have had too much trouble with them. The points are the dullest out of the three sets.

I have opinions but these are just my preferences. \n\nI have heard that Knit Picks doesn't have all that great quality, but I haven't bought many needles from there. I guess they recently moved production/sourcing and it screwed some stuff up? Anyway, that's 3rd hand info for you. \n\nMy personal favorites are HiyaHiyas, followed by chiaogoo, followed by addi. And here's why:\n\n**addi** \n\n* well known for their brass needles, which smell funny to some people and have a more \"sticky\" feel than other metals\n* most flexible cords, which annoys me because the cord is EVERYWHERE OMG\n* most expensive (last I checked)\n* I have heard the joins on the interchangeables are excellent but I haven't used them myself\n* moderate sharpness\n\n**HiyaHiya**\n\n* HiyaHiya sharps are the sharpest - sharper than addi lace or chiaogoo lace (I think there is one brand that has sharper needles but I can't remember what it is)\n* Buying both sets is more expensive, but you get a wider range of sizes (US2-15 vs ... US4-10.5? I think?) \n* You can pick one or the other. Personally I use smaller yarn weights more so I got US2-8. \n* moderate flexibility cords\n* joins are good. I do have to rescrew mine relatively often\n* the smoothest needles ever (I think they're hallow stainless steel)\n\n**Chaiogoo**\n\n* I think these are brushed stainless? So they're heavier and more textured than the HiyaHiyas\n* the cord is designed to prevent kinking (yeah, I've kinked one though) so it's pretty stiff. Good for some things, not so good for magic loop\n* pretty sharp, close second to the HiyaHiyas\n* Can't speak to joins because I haven't used the interchangeables\n* I think these are the cheapest of the 3\n\nIf you haven't tried these, I highly encourage you to try the ones you are thinking of. I think needle choice is such a personal preference and you really won't know until you try. :)\n\n### Comment ID cx7iug7 with +2 score by [(BinChicken, Reddit, 2015-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx7iug7/) (in reply to ID cx79fhi):\nJust to expand on your point, I got the small set of hiya hiyas, and the larger sizes I picked up in the knitpicks metal needles.\r\rThis is because I find bulky yarn does not have as much trouble getting past things like joins.\n\n### Comment ID cx863j3 with +2 score by [(Celt42, Reddit, 2015-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx863j3/) (in reply to ID cx79fhi):\nLove the break down, thanks!\n\n## Comment ID cx792c9 with +3 score by [(arcticfawx, Reddit, 2015-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx792c9/) (in reply to ID 3tl1e8):\nI've never tried Hiya Hiya, but I have knitpicks and ChiaoGoo small set. Waiting a while to get the large set as well. I like the ChiaoGoos a LOT more than my knitpicks set. They're buttery smooth to knit with, nothing falls apart, the cables are so flexible they're awesome for magic looping. My knitpicks were constantly coming apart, the needles fell out of their sockets, the joins were snaggy, they needles unscrewed from the cables in the middle of projects and the cables were stiff as a rod with tons of memory. It was nearly impossible to do magic loop on my knitpicks without giant ladders because the stiffness in the cables kept wanting to push everything apart. I never use my knitpicks set anymore since getting the Chiaogoos, except on the rare occasion I need needle sizes larger than 5mm, since I don't have the large Chiaogoo set yet. I kinda wanna get rid of them completely but haven't gotten around to selling them yet. \n\nOn the other hand, knitpicks customer service is excellent, and they'll replace anything if you call them about it. But at this point about 70% of the needle tips I've gotten from them have been replaced or glued back together. It's not worth the effort. Though that's only the wood tips. The metal ones are fine, but issues with the cables and joins still apply.\n\n## Comment ID cx75ga2 with +2 score by [(emma1961, Reddit, 2015-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/3tl1e8/knit_picks_options_vs_hiya_hiya_vs/cx75ga2/) (in reply to ID 3tl1e8):\nI have complete sets of both Hiya Hiya and ChiaoGoo.

Hands down, the TWIST Red Cables of the ChiaoGoo, beat out the Hiya Hiya cables. They're much, much more substantial and therefore lay nice and flat. The Hiya Hiya cables are very thin, like fishing line, and they are always in my way. The only thing about the Hiya Hiya cables that I like are that they swivel where the ChiaoGoo cables do not.\n\nThat being said, if I had only used the Hiya Hiya set I would have been perfectly happy with them.

I use the 5 and wish I would have purchased the 4's.\n\nAddi\n\n* The addi case annoys the piss out of me due to not having a zipper on the pouch and the cables falling out of that open pouch. It's the little things...  However, I like how thin the case is.\n* I find it insulting that addi didn't include end stoppers in the set particularly considering how expensive the set is.  Talk about being cheap asshats.\n* For me, I cannot easily see where I need to line up the addi's to make the connection due to less than stellar eyesight.  \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't purchase something that has two different materials comprising the needle (birch/metal) owing to wood expanding and contracting.

I'm not a very big SF fan, so I'm not very knowledgeable on the series, thus i don't know anything about Manon's playstyle.\n\n### Comment ID jx6ae6t with +4 score by [(epicsimitt, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/15xg3qm/hiya_any_tips_for_a_total_beginner_with_little/jx6ae6t/) (in reply to ID jx69e9n):\nHmm shes a steamroller grappler has a couple of normals that vacuum the opponent in in order to hit her command grab, also has a hitgrab. She wants to be at mid-range usually with some good defensive stuff like anti-airs or alternatives for mixups. I like her because her moveset lets you play a lot of mindgames with the opponent like \"am I going to try and grab you or strike you\" and if they guess wrong then punish accordingly\n\n#### Comment ID jx6cjmb with +14 score by [(Hintothemagnificent, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/15xg3qm/hiya_any_tips_for_a_total_beginner_with_little/jx6cjmb/) (in reply to ID jx6ae6t):\nThe only true grappler in strive is Potemkin, and he's more a love or hate cult following character. He struggled at the higher ranks, but he will be perfectly viable for a long time (not to mention getting buffed s3). However I can recommend Ky or Sol who are shoto esque and the more basic of the characters. Gio plays somewhat similar to Cammy, and the rest are a mixed bag. If you like mindgames then possibly Ino or Millia as they're heavy mix up characters but they come with a cost of low HP or struggling to get in. But yeah, you're definitely just gonna have to spend some time exploring the cast to get a feel, I'd just try a lot our versus some cpus and see who you vibe with.\n\n#### Comment ID jx6dwju with +7 score by [(Werducc, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/15xg3qm/hiya_any_tips_for_a_total_beginner_with_little/jx6dwju/) (in reply to ID jx6ae6t):\nI'd say try out either Potemkin or Nago\n\nFirst one is a slow grappler with sluggish, yet big normals and somewhat poor defense, but with a very rewarding strike/throw mixup. He usually always wants to be upfront to run his game. His damage off single hits is massive, yet he has issues with getting in against most of the cast. His Strike/throw also isn't the most ambiguous due to him not having alot of options, so he will have a hard time running his game against more experienced players.\n\nNago is not a grappler, but a defensive neutral based character whose main job is to use big pokes from mid-range in order to run his strike/throw mixup via his command grab and rekka. He has poor aerial movement like Potemkin, but unlike Potemkin he has a fast command dash which heavily improves his grounded footsies and makes his attacks unpredictable at times. His damage is also massive, but unlike Potemkin you achieve that damage through relatively simple combos instead of single hits. Also unlike Potemkin, his Strike/throw can be very ambiguous because he has ALOT of options off his rekka. He can grab, frametrap, bait and go back to neutral several ways just off his rekka alone. Nago might sound like a better Potemkin at this point, but there's one thing that really drags Nago down and that's the fact that you have to resource manage. Nago's blood gauge means death if it hits 3 bars and considering ALL of his special moves (other than his command grab) causes his blood gauge to rise, and you can find yourself having a hard time in neutral against characters who like to keep their distance, making him even weaker against zoning than Potemkin, since he's not allowed to make mistakes at all.\n\nKeep this all in mind and try both of these characters. If you find one of them enjoyable, refer to [Dustloop](https://www.dustloop.com/w/GGST) immediately. Here you will find all the info you will need to successfully run your main.\n\n#### Comment ID jx6yymu with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/15xg3qm/hiya_any_tips_for_a_total_beginner_with_little/jx6yymu/) (in reply to ID jx6ae6t):\nYou like grapplers play lot join the glue eaters become one of them do it you know you want to\n\n## Comment ID jx6x88c with +3 score by [(IDontWipe55, Reddit, 2023-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/15xg3qm/hiya_any_tips_for_a_total_beginner_with_little/jx6x88c/) (in reply to ID 15xg3qm):\nGuilty Gear as a whole is super fast paced so you’ll just have to get used to it. I-No is a momentum based character with a moderately simple gameplan. She gets a knockdown 214P and then dashes in for a mixup with instant overheads and lows. Once you have your opponent conditioned you can go for a normal grab or her command grab super. She’s also got some long range specials like Manon.

Except he goes for strike punishes rather than grabs. But pick whoever looks cool even if they are a different playstyle. My SF main has a radically different playstyle from my GG main.

I've always had such an interest in music production and singing. My father told me about this for the first time in 4th grade after the holiday choir concert I was in for my school. Our family is spread across a few states. We're in NJ while he, and other members of the family, were in the southern parts of the country. We don't talk to our family because of really bad relations with them, and hell I don't even speak to my father anymore for the same exact reason. My Dad loves Country Music and Rock/Metal Music, just as a fun fact. I believe he had Eddy's Christmas album \"Christmas with Eddy Arnold\" on CD. \n\nI'm still learning more about my Uncle Eddy. One thing I know for a fact is that he loved Christmas, which is funny because I'm the complete opposite. I love Halloween so much more. And I, shockingly, am the only one in the family that DOESN'T like Country Music. I'm more of a metalhead/nerdcore/rocker/cinematic lover when it comes to my taste in music. But from what I've heard and been told, my Uncle and I have a lot in common. Especially when it comes to our passions and love for all things music. Eddy died when I was 3, so I never even got the chance to meet him. \n\nThe reason why I'm posting this is because I want to connect with some fans of his and see the type of impact my Uncle's music had on them. If you have any type of memories of his music, please tell me in the replies!

I feel like Cowpoke is one of the most beautifully done songs I've ever come across. Simply beautiful. I know Colter Wall gets a lot of attention for covering this song, most people think it's his song and don't realize it's a cover. I personally prefer the Eddy Arnold version but Colter Wall's is still very well executed.\nAnyways, Cowpoke is just, I don't know there are really no words to describe how beautiful it is to me. From the soft hum & harmonica, the guitar strumming it along, the way he sings with such grace, and the lyrics, the lyrics, they're perfect. It's truly an amazing song.\nThat's really cool that he's your great uncle. I'd say it's an honor. Even though other than Cowpoke and Cattle Call, I know nothing else of his music. His one song speaks enough to me alone but I will be on the hunt for more of his treasures!\nHonestly rock & country have so many similarities. Maybe you just need to ease yourself into it \nI used to be all rock, I hated country, but I loved the south (where I was born, Mississippi) I always felt country way of life in my bones and in my soul despite being raised in Phoenix, Arizona.\nI was introduced to real country music as a young adult and so it was love. \nI listen to many different kinds of country. Very old, to 90s, to less known stuff like Tyler Childers, Ryan Bingham, Colter Wall etc. but most  \"country\" you hear on the radio today isn't really country in my opinion. \nThe vast meaning of country to me is the music I could rest my soul on.

That figure is $104.99 USD, but despite the fact they're showing pictures of it with paint, it isn't actually painted at all.

      "# [Hiya News: Global Phone Spam and Fraud Report: Nearly a Third of All Unknown Calls in First Half of 2024 Were Unwanted](https://www.hiya.com/press-releases/global-phone-spam-and-fraud-report-nearly-a-third-of-all-unknown-calls-in-first-half-of-2024-were-unwanted)\nSeattle, Washington (August 22, 2024) — Hiya, the global leader in voice security, has published H1 2024 Global Call Threat Report, which explores the volume, frequency and type of phone spam and fraud across major global markets between January and June of 2024.\n\nDownload Hiya’s H1 2024 Global Call Threat Report to learn more:\n\n‍https://hiya.com/global-call-threat-report\n\nIn the first six months of 2024, Hiya flagged nearly 20 billion calls as suspected spam – more than 107 million spam calls everyday. Hiya’s data showed spam flag rates of more than 20% of unknown calls (calls coming from outside of someone’s address book) in 25 out of the 42 countries included in the report – with some spam flag rates above 50%.\n\nThe first half of 2024 also saw an increase in AI deepfake scams, which use AI-generated voice-cloning technology to impersonate people and/or organizations. Ahead of the primary election in January, voters in New Hampshire received robocalls impersonating Joe Biden using an AI-generated voice. As AI tools become more powerful and accessible, Hiya anticipates that voice-cloning impersonation scam tactics will continue to be on the rise in 2024 and beyond.\n\nMedicare and insurance scams continue to target Americans\n\nAmericans received an average of 14 spam calls per month in the first six months of 2024. The rate of spam flag rate varies state-by-state with Oklahoma, Indiana and Ohio having the highest rates of spam in H1, while Alaska, New York and North Dakota had the lowest. Health insurance and medicare scams were popular in the US between January and June followed by other insurance scams, including auto, home, and life. Tax scams were also on the rise in the first half, and steadily increased leading up to the April 15 tax filing deadline.\n\nFrance and Spain continues to have the worst spam across Europe, for past 7 quarters\n\nMore than half of all unknown calls in France and Spain were unwanted – with spam flag rates of 53% and 51%, respectively. On average French and Spanish residents receive more than 12 nuisance or fraud calls each month. Despite similar spam flag rates, Spain has a bigger fraud problem as 12% of unknown calls are fraud compared to 5% in France.\n\nThe most commonly reported fraud calls in Spain were utility and mobile phone sales scams. In February, a new TikTok scam call emerged as users reported robocalls offering 800 Euros a day to watch and like videos on TikTok. Utility related scams, including electricity suppliers and solar energy, were the top scams in the first half of 2024 in France. Telemarketing calls, banking-related scam calls and package delivery scams were also common.\n\nUK residents are targeted with tax agency and Amazon scams\n\nThe UK had a spam flag rate of 28% of all unknown calls, and 3% of those calls were fraud in H1. Popular phone scams across the UK in the first half of the year included tax scams, specifically impersonating Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), Amazon scams and credit card scams. Cryptocurrency, energy-related and immigration scams were also on the rise.\n\nBrazillians receive the most spam calls per month across the globe\n\nBrazillians received an average 26 spam calls per month in the first half of 2024. More than half of the unidentified calls in the country were spam (51%) with 13% of those being fraud. Banking scams are the most popular phone scam across Brazil with Hiya users reporting scammers impersonating a bank and calling to confirm personal information and passwords.\n\nAmazon scams surged across Canada\n\nWhile Canadians only received an average of 4 spam calls per person each month, 7% of those calls were fraud. In 2023, Amazon scams were the most popular scam targeting Canadians and continued into the first half of 2024 – hitting a peak in mid-April. Scams impersonating government officials were also popular in H1 followed by credit card and cryptocurrency scams.\n\n“Phone fraud, spam and the emerging use of AI-driven deepfake voice scams are escalating threats to the voice channel, affecting every phone user across every major market,” shared Kush Parikh, President of Hiya. “The voice channel deserves the same level of vigilance that enterprises apply to cybersecurity. In fact, voice security must be swiftly integrated into cybersecurity strategies, as it represents a significant vulnerability in protecting enterprises.”\n\nHiya report methodology\n\nThe H1 2024 Global Call Threat Report is based on a representative sample of calls observed by Hiya on the Hiya Voice Security Network, which includes Samsung Smart Call enabled devices and the Hiya mobile app. The spam ratios in this report represent unknown calls outside of an individual’s contact list calls that Hiya has identified and flagged as either fraud or nuisance.\n\nDownload the complete H1 2024 Global Call Threat Report to learn more.\n\nAbout Hiya",
      "# [Hiya's new Chrome extension identifies deepfakes by Shaun Kehrberg](https://blog.hiya.com/hiyas-new-chrome-extension-identifies-deepfakes)\nHiya has released a new, free, Chrome extension that helps internet users identify deepfake audio. The web browser extension empowers consumers to identify fake content online by analyzing voices in real-time.\n\nPowered by Hiya Protect’s advanced AI voice technology, the new tool makes deepfake detection accessible to everyone, analyzing content across social media, news, or other websites. By sampling just one second of video or audio, it can determine if a voice is authentic or AI-generated.\n\nThe extension is easy to install and designed to provide a seamless browsing experience. In an era of rampant disinformation, it helps users safeguard against misleading content and scams.\n\nDownload the Hiya Deepfake Voice Detector extension\n\nIn this deepfake YouTube video, Taylor Swift’s voice is cloned and used to pitch a set of cookware.\n\nVoice cloning being exploited by cybercriminals\n\n“At Hiya, we’re committed to combating scams, fraud, and misinformation,” said Kush Parikh, President at Hiya. “Deepfakes are becoming harder to detect, making it difficult to discern between real and fabricated content. Voice cloning, while an incredible technological innovation, is also being exploited by cybercriminals for scams and even to try to influence major events like elections.”\n\nRecent research by Hiya (a survey of 2,000 US consumers conducted by OnePoll in July) highlights the increasing prevalence of deepfake scams. Results showed that more than 1 in 4 people had been exposed to an audio deepfake, and more than 1 in 10 people said they experienced a video deepfake. Deepfake videos were most commonly encountered on Facebook, YouTube and TikTok.\n\n“It’s clear social media sites have a huge responsibility to alert users when the content they are consuming has a high chance of being an AI deepfake,” said Parikh. “The onus is currently on the individual to be vigilant if they are concerned content is being altered. That’s a big ask, so we’re pleased to be able to support them with a solution that helps put some of the power back in their hands.”\n\nFact-checking organizations trust Hiya’s technology\n\nHiya’s AI Voice Detection technology is already trusted by media and consumer fact-checking organizations, including AFP Fact Check, Deepfake Analysis Unit, RTVE.es, and TrueMedia.org.\n\nTrueMedia.org is a non-profit, non-partisan, organization that empowers anyone to detect political deepfakes in social media. It uses Hiya’s voice detection technology to help citizens around the world identify fake audio. According to the organization, there were more than 500,000 video and voice deepfakes shared on social media around the world in 2023. TrueMedia.org was recently praised by Microsoft's Vice Chair and President Brad Smith as a great example of using good AI to combat bad AI.\n\nTrueMedia.org uses Hiya’s voice detection technology to help citizens around the world identify deepfake audio in social media.\n\nTo learn more about deepfake voice detection, and to download Hiya’s Chrome extension, visit hiya.com/products/deepfake-voice-detector.",
      "# [How to detect and defend against deepfake voice scams by Shaun Kehrberg](https://blog.hiya.com/how-to-detect-and-defend-against-audio-deepfakes)\nPhone scams have been around since practically the invention of the landline. But there’s a dangerous new element making scam calls even more convincing: the use of deepfake voice technology.\n\nA deepfake can be any type of media — audio, video, image— that has been digitally manipulated, typically for the purpose of misleading people or changing the original meaning. A voice deepfake, sometimes known as AI voice cloning, uses artificial intelligence to construct spoken sentences that sound like people saying something they did not actually say. This voice track can even be placed underneath real video footage, making it appear as if a person has endorsed or carries an opinion contrary to their own. The coupling of real video and false audio can make these deepfakes more challenging to detect and flag.\n\nDeepfake voice scams aren’t new, but AI is making them more real and easier to create. In the past, deepfakes required a significant amount of time and technical expertise. Today, there are more than a dozen AI voice cloning tools freely available on the internet. These tools require only a basic level of expertise to use.\n\nRELATED: See how our Chief Product Officer Faked the Voice of Hiya's CEO\n\nExamples of deepfake voice scams\n\nFamily emergency scams – Family emergency scams, sometimes called loved-ones scams or grandparent scams, involve a fraudster pretending to be a family member who is experiencing an emergency and in need of immediate financial help. In the past, fraudsters might simply imitate a sobbing child or grandchild, but now scammers can use AI voice cloning that makes the ruse ever more convincing.\n\nEmployee impersonations – Employee impersonations using deepfake voice technology are also becoming more common. News reports tell of an employee paying out $25 million after being fooled by a deepfake video call impersonating the company’s CFO, and a hacker deepfaking an employee’s voice to gain access to the company’s computer systems.\n\nPolitical deepfakes – One of the most prominent deepfake voice scams occurred earlier this year, as the U.S. presidential election season was just getting underway. In the Democratic primary in New Hampshire, a deepfake voice clone of President Joe Biden was used in a robocall to voters urging them to skip primary voting and instead save their vote for the general election.\n\nCompanies are beginning to take notice of this trend. In a survey conducted by the identity verification firm Regula, 37% of worldwide organizations have experienced voice deepfake identity fraud, and 82% or organizations think that voice deepfakes will be a growing threat in the next two years.\n\nDeepfake voice detection by humans is unreliable\n\nAccording to a 2023 study conducted by researchers from the Department of Security and Crime Science at University College London in the UK, humans cannot reliably detect speech deepfakes. In an experiment conducted with more than 500 participants, individuals listened to real and fake audio clips and attempted to differentiate between them. The result: listeners could only correctly identify voice deepfakes 73% of the time.\n\nThe study concluded, “As speech synthesis algorithms improve and become more realistic, we can expect the detection task to become harder. The difficulty of detecting speech deepfakes confirms their potential for misuse and signals that defenses against this threat are needed.”\n\nGovernmental regulations seek to rein in deepfakes\n\nThe battle against deepfakes and AI voice scams needs to be fought on multiple fronts. Governments play a role too. In August, the European Union’s AI Act was enacted. It’s the world’s first major law regulating the use of AI, and it governs the way companies develop, use and apply AI.\n\nAccording to NBC News, “The legislation applies a risk-based approach to regulating AI, which means that different applications of the technology are regulated differently depending on the level of risk they pose to society.” Examples of high-risk AI systems include autonomous vehicles, medical devices, loan decisioning systems, educational scoring, and remote biometric identification systems.\n\nThe United States is also drafting laws to protect against impersonations and deepfakes. Earlier this year, the US Federal Trade Commission sought public comment on a proposal that would prohibit the impersonation of individuals, which would extend protections of a new rule on government and business impersonation.\n\nAccording to the FTC, “The agency is taking this action in light of surging complaints around impersonation fraud, as well as public outcry about the harms caused to consumers and to impersonated individuals. Emerging technology — including AI-generated deepfakes — threatens to turbocharge this scourge, and the FTC is committed to using all of its tools to detect, deter, and halt impersonation fraud.”\n\nEven US states are passing legislation to combat deepfakes. Recently, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 2839 (AB 2839). The law aims to address the rise of AI-generated disinformation ahead of 2024 elections, stating that AB 2839 is crucial for protecting the integrity of elections and restoring voter trust.\n\nHow to defend against deepfake voice imposters\n\nAlthough scams carried out using deepfake speech synthesis pose a danger for both individuals and business, not all is lost. Fortunately, there is a way to identify deepfakes. While fraudsters are using AI for sinister purposes, the same technology can also be used for good.\n\nEarlier this month, Hiya acquired Locus.ai, the industry leader in deepfake detection solutions. The combination of Loccus.ai’s voice intelligence technology and the Hiya’s Adaptive AI fraud prevention system, provides businesses and carriers with the most complete fraud call protection available across the industry today. This versatile solution supports multiple languages, formats, and platforms, including video recordings and live calls across all devices.\n\nLoccus.ai’s deepfake voice detection technology is now available as Hiya AI Voice Detection. Businesses and carriers can immediately integrate AI voice detection into their own services and applications to enhance consumer trust and security. With Hiya, it’s never been easier to identify deepfake audio in personal communications apps, news and social media content, video conferencing contact center platforms, and more.",

(NYSE: USNA) (the “Company,” “USANA”), today announced its acquisition of a 78.8% controlling ownership stake in Hiya Health Products, LLC (“Hiya”), a leading direct-to-consumer provider of high-quality children’s health & wellness products. The $205 million cash transaction closed on December 23, 2024 and is anticipated to be accretive to USANA’s 2025 adjusted EBITDA. For the last twelve months ended September 30, 2024 (unaudited), Hiya generated net sales of $103 million, net income of $19 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $22 million. As of September 30, 2024, Hiya had more than 200,000 customers.\n\n“The Hiya brand is a natural fit for USANA and this acquisition represents a key strategic milestone for our business,” said Jim Brown, President and Chief Executive Officer of USANA Health Sciences, Inc. “Hiya’s co-founders, Darren Litt and Adam Gillman, have disrupted the children’s health and wellness market by building a high quality, better-for-you brand that aligns with our vision of creating the healthiest family on Earth. This strategic acquisition adds a diversified layer of growth to USANA’s overall business, while maintaining our commitment to our core direct sales business, where we continue to invest in initiatives to drive growth. Notably, this acquisition will allow USANA to reach a broader audience by diversifying distribution channels through Hiya, which we believe will enhance our ability to generate sustainable long-term growth and deliver value for our stakeholders. Darren and Adam will continue to lead Hiya through its next phase of growth. Their leadership and expertise is instrumental to Hiya’s business, which is now part of USANA’s mission and strategic objectives.”\n\nDarren Litt, co-founder and CEO of Hiya, commented, “Today represents an exciting chapter for Hiya and we are thrilled to join the USANA family. As parents ourselves, we recognized that so many wellness companies did not prioritize our children’s health interests, so we created Hiya to give families the very best in clean, honest nutrition. With the help of USANA's extensive capabilities, support and international expertise, we can now extend that commitment to create healthy products for more families in more countries. USANA and Hiya share a deep commitment to improving the lives of families everywhere by providing the best nutritional products possible, and we look forward to continuing this exciting journey as part of USANA.”\n\nStrategic Rationale\n\nFast-Growing, Emerging Leader in the Children’s Health and Wellness Market. The acquisition of Hiya provides the opportunity for USANA to expand its presence in the children’s health & wellness market through Hiya. For the last twelve months ended September 30, 2024, Hiya’s net sales of $103 million grew 50% as compared to fiscal year 2023. For fiscal year 2025, the Company currently anticipates Hiya’s net sales growth to approach 30% year-over-year.\n\nStrengthens USANA’s Financial Profile. Hiya offers a compelling subscription model with attractive margins, profitability, and cash flow generation, which is expected to enhance the Company’s ability to deliver long-term growth and drive shareholder value. Hiya’s domestic profitability diversifies USANA’s geographic sales mix and is anticipated to lower the Company’s consolidated effective tax rate and create a more tax-efficient structure.\n\nPresents Opportunity to Accelerate Growth and Enhance Profitability by Leveraging Synergies. Over the next several years, USANA and Hiya will work together to take advantage of identified synergies, assets and expertise across both companies to create efficiencies, and to accelerate growth and profitability. For example, there are opportunities for Hiya to leverage USANA’s significant manufacturing and international expansion expertise. Similarly, USANA may leverage Hiya’s market data insights, marketing expertise, and children-focused products within its direct sales channel.\n\nChannel Expansion into Direct-to-Consumer Wellness Market with a Leading and Proven Brand. Hiya currently holds a leading position in children’s Vitamins, Minerals & Supplements brand sales in the United Statesⁱ and has a clear pathway and strong growth strategy to become the #1 children’s wellness platform through new product introductions, channel expansion, and geographic expansion. Hiya’s commitment to being the most trusted and preferred brand for wellness products in the 0-18 age range is an additive category for the Company and is complimentary to USANA’s vision of the healthiest family on Earth.\n\nExpands the Company’s United States Operations. The transaction meaningfully expands and diversifies the Company’s revenue mix as Hiya’s net sales are generated in the United States through their direct-to-consumer subscription model, with plans to enter other sales channels. This will allow USANA to reach a broader audience of health-conscious consumers to grow the enterprise’s overall customer base.\n\nⁱ Source: Nielsen\n\nTransaction Highlights\n\nThe Company made an initial cash investment of approximately $205 million (subject to customary closing and post-closing purchase price adjustments) in exchange for a 78.8% ownership stake in Hiya.\n\nTransaction structure includes a put/call feature that provides for USANA’s acquisition of the remaining rollover equity at a pre-negotiated valuation scale, which is based on Hiya’s financial performance.\n\nThe transaction was financed with $200 million cash on hand with the balance covered by the Company’s existing credit facility.\n\nBofA Securities acted as exclusive financial advisor to the Company in connection with the transaction. Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C. served as the Company’s legal advisor. William Hood & Company, LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor to Hiya. Bodman PLC acted as Hiya’s legal advisor.\n\nConference Call\n\nThe Company will provide a supplemental presentation and discuss the transaction on a conference call on Monday, December 23, 2024 at 5:00 PM Eastern Time. The supplemental presentation and live audio webcast of the conference call will be available on the Company’s investor relations website at http://ir.usana.com.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release contains the non-GAAP financial measure LTM adjusted EBITDA of Hiya. Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP financial measure of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization that also excludes certain adjustments as indicated below in the reconciliation from net income.\n\nThe Company prepares its financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and investors should not directly compare with or infer relationship from any of the Company’s operating results presented in accordance with GAAP to the LTM adjusted EBITDA of Hiya. We believe that this non-GAAP financial information of Hiya may be helpful to investors as an indication of future cash flow generation. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of non-GAAP financial information as a tool for comparison. As a result, the non-GAAP financial information of Hiya is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income, presented and reported in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA:\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nLast Twelve Months Ended ($000's)\n\n30-Sep-24\n\nNet income\n\n$\n\n19,416\n\nDefinitional Adjustments:\n\nInterest expense\n\n143\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n38\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n80\n\nEBITDA before Adjustments\n\n19,677\n\nAdjustments to EBITDA:\n\nTransaction expenses and other non-recurring items\n\n760\n\nNon-operational costs\n\n566\n\nNormalizations\n\n321\n\nTiming adjustments\n\n212\n\nManagement compensation\n\n142\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\n$\n\n21,678\n\nAbout USANA\n\nUSANA develops and manufactures high-quality nutritional supplements, functional foods and personal care products that are sold directly to Associates and Preferred Customers throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, the Philippines, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Thailand, France, Belgium, Colombia, Indonesia, Germany, Spain, Romania, Italy, and India.

But again its their assumption.\n\nI trust cooltoys as well plus pre-orders are also payed in full if you buy them from AliX although in theory there is an extra layer of protection there.

They may very well have already run the entire uniformed crew off already since it's so much easier to swap out injection plastic supply containers than the molds themselves are (as far my production line experience with Igloo Coolers 30y ago tells me, at least).\n\nHisstank.Com General\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2020\n\nLocation: PA\n\nPosts: 5,201\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by SlicesCustoms\n\nI got mine just fine.
