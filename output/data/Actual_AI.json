      "# [Actual AI](https://www.actual.ai/)\nAgile metrics are meaningless\n\nDevelopers don't trust engineering leadership that uses story points, DORA metrics, number of commits, or lines of code to identify top performers. They know that these metrics don't correlate with effort or business value.\n\nDevelopers love justice\n\nWhen developers work hard, they want to be rewarded and they don't want to work with slackers.

If you purchase a recurring subscription, you authorize Actual AI or its third-party service providers to periodically charge you for an automatically renewing subscription requiring recurring payments at the stated frequency (e.g., monthly or annual) (each a “Subscription Period”) until canceled. You will be charged your first subscription fee and any applicable taxes (“Subscription Fee”) on the date you purchase your subscription or after your free trial ends. Your subscription will automatically continue at the selected interval, and you will continue to be charged at the then-current price (including any applicable taxes), unless at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period: (a) you terminate your account; (b) you cancel your subscription (as described below); (c) we decline to renew your subscription; or (d) these Terms are otherwise properly terminated as expressly permitted herein. The Subscription Fee is non-refundable except as expressly set forth in these Terms or in accordance with applicable law.\n\nIf any Subscription Fee is not paid in a timely manner, or your transaction cannot be processed, we reserve the right to suspend, disable, cancel or terminate your access to the Service or cancel your subscription.

Please note that we do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering.\n\nB. Authorization to Charge for the Service. You must provide accurate and complete information for a valid payment method that you are authorized to use (such as a credit card, payment via an app store, or other payment method accepted by us to activate and maintain a paid account).

You are also responsible for charges for any additional features or purchases made through your account that are offered for sale through our Service.

Actual AI (or its third-party service providers) may change the fees for the Service or any feature of the Service.\n\nIf we do not receive payment via your payment method, you agree to pay all amounts due hereunder upon our demand and will be solely responsible for any dispute with your payment provider. If the payment method you provide is initially declined for any reason, we reserve the right to charge the payment method (credit card or other accepted mechanism) in installments, at the non-promotional/non-discounted rate that is in place at the time, for the full duration of the subscription that you have selected. You bear sole responsibility for all overdraft fees or other penalties that may be assessed by your payment provider. You are responsible for any use of your credit card or other payment instrument.\n\nC. Cancellation. When you cancel a subscription, you cancel only future charges associated with your subscription. You may initiate your cancellation at any time, but the cancellation will become effective at the end of your current Subscription Period. In order to avoid future charges, you must cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the end of your current Subscription Period. If you purchased through Actual AI directly, you may cancel within your account settings. Alternatively, if you email us at legal@actual.ai at least 24 hours before the end of your current Subscription Period, we will do our best to implement the cancellation prior to your next renewal; if we cannot, we can offer you a refund for that inadvertent renewal. If you purchased through a third party (e.g., app store), you must cancel through that third party. Purchases through third parties are subject to that third party’s cancellation policies and procedures.After canceling a subscription, you will continue to have access to the Service for the remainder of your current Subscription Period for which you have already paid (unless we provide you with a refund or otherwise allow you to use the unused portion towards another service, product, or subscription).\n\nD. Limited Refund Period. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED HEREIN OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FEE IS NONREFUNDABLE. Unless required by applicable law, if you cancel your subscription, you are not entitled to receive any refund or credit, full or partial. We reserve the right to issue refunds, credits, or discounts at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund, credit, or discount, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future. If you purchased through a third party, your ability to receive a refund is governed by that third party’s policies and procedures.\n\nE. Free Trial and Promotional Rates. Actual AI may offer promotional trial periods during which you can use the Service for free or at a promotional rate. Such trial or promotional trial periods are subject to these Terms except as otherwise stated in the promotional offer, including which users are eligible for the promotional subscription. Eligibility is initially determined at the time of the order. Free trial and promotional rates cannot be applied retroactively.If your subscription includes a free trial, you will not be charged the applicable fee during your free trial. To obtain the free trial, you may be required to provide a credit card or other payment method in order to ensure uninterrupted access and continued use after the free trial ends. Upon completion of your free trial, your subscription will automatically convert into a paid subscription and your payment method will be charged the Subscription Fee unless you have canceled your subscription. You may cancel your subscription during your free trial to avoid being charged as described above.If your subscription includes a promotional rate, you will be charged the promotional rate for the relevant number of Subscription Periods and upon completion of the final promotional Subscription Period, your subscription will continue to automatically renew at the full rate. To cancel and avoid being charged the full rate, you must notify us before the discount or promotional period ends.If a stated price or other material information is determined by us in our sole discretion to be in error, we are not under any obligation to offer you the Service at that price and reserve the right to cancel, terminate or not process orders (including accepted orders). We will notify you of the error and either provide you with a refund or give you the opportunity to cancel your order and obtain a refund if payment has already been made.You may only be permitted to use one free trial or discounted price offer. You may not be permitted to combine the promotional offer with any other promotion, except as otherwise stated in the promotional offer. If your subscription is ever cancelled or terminated for any reason, and you purchase an additional subscription, you may not be eligible for a free trial or to take advantage of another discounted price offer.\n\nF. Termination. We may terminate your subscription at our sole discretion and without any notice. If we cancel your subscription, we may give you a prorated refund based on the amount of time remaining that you cannot use, provided, however, that we will not be obligated to grant you a refund if we terminate your account or your subscription because we determine, in our sole discretion, that your actions or your use of the Service violates these Terms, any applicable law, or has harmed Actual AI or another user or entity.\n\nUpon termination or cancellation of your subscription, you may lose access to the products, content, features, and work-product provided to you or created by you in relation to the Service.\n\nG. Changes to the Subscription or Service. We may change the subscription terms or Subscription Fees at any time on a going forward basis at our discretion. If the pricing for your subscription increases, we will notify you, and provide you an opportunity to change or cancel your subscription before applying those changes to your account or charging you in connection with an automatic renewal. We may choose in our sole discretion to add, modify, or remove benefits and features from a subscription. If you do not cancel your subscription prior to the time the modifications become effective, you agree to the changes.

Actual AI is under no obligation to maintain any link on the Service and may remove a link at any time in its sole discretion for any reason whatsoever.\n\nB. Third-Party Integrations. The Service may allow you to connect, integrate, or sync with your Actual AI account certain accounts provided by or retrieve information maintained by third-parties with whom you have a customer relationship, maintain an account, or engage in financial transactions (“Third-Party Integrations”). Actual AI may use third-party data sources to assist in facilitating Third-Party Integrations and collect and sync data from Third-Party Integrations (“Third-Party Integration Data”). Actual AI does not review Third-Party Integration Data for accuracy, legality or non-infringement. Actual AI is not responsible for Third-Party Integration Data or products and services offered by or on third-party sites. Actual AI cannot always foresee or anticipate technical or other difficulties which may result in failure to obtain data or loss of data, and personalization settings, or from device operating environment malfunctions or other service interruptions. Actual AI cannot assume responsibility for the timeliness, accuracy, deletion, non-delivery or failure to store any user data, communications or personalization settings. You are responsible for connecting, integrating, and syncing with Third-Party Integrations. For example, you may be required to provide valid credentials for the Third-Party Integration. You may also be required to generate authentication codes, keys, or other tools to connect with a Third-Party Integration. We may provide tools to facilitate such connections and/or guides detailing a process for facilitating such connections, but you are entirely responsible for arranging such connections in an accurate, complete, and secure manner. You agree that Actual AI disclaims any responsibility or liability for and that Actual AI will not be held liable for any loss arising out of relating to your connection to a Third-Party Integration.\n\nC. Disclaimer of Liability for Third-Party Services and Third-Party Integrations. Third-Party Services and Third-Party Integrations may have their own terms of use and privacy policies, and your use of the Service may incur third-party fees, such as fees charged by your carrier for data usage. You are solely responsible for reviewing and complying with any terms of use, privacy policies, or other terms governing your use of Third-Party Services and Third-Party Integrations, and you are solely responsible for all of Third-Party Services and Third-Party Integrations fees incurred by you for use of the Service. You are solely responsible for taking the precautions necessary to protect yourself from fraud when using Third-Party Services and Third-Party Integrations, and to protect your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content that may be included on or with any Third-Party Services and Third-Party Integrations. Actual AI disclaims any responsibility or liability for any harm resulting from your use of Third-Party Services and Third-Party Integrations, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against Actual AI with respect to any Third-Party Services and Third-Party Integrations.\n\n14. Dispute Resolution.\n\nA. Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Actual AI in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Actual AI agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the expiration or termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Actual AI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION. YOU FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION TERMS WILL APPLY TO YOU AND Actual AI UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO OPT OUT PURSUANT TO SECTION 14.I (OPT OUT).\n\nWhether to agree to arbitration is an important business decision. It is your decision to make, and you should not rely solely on the information provided in these Terms as it is not intended to contain a complete explanation of the consequences of arbitration. You should take further steps to conduct research and to consult with others, including an attorney, regarding the consequences of your decision, just as you would when making any other important business or life decision.\n\nB. Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 14.A (Generally), nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (1) bring an individual action in small claims court; (2) bring an action in a court pursuant to the California Private Attorneys General Act of 2004, California Labor Code § 2698 et seq.; (3) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (4) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.\n\nC. Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Actual AI will be governed by the US Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Actual AI. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.\n\nD. Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail within the applicable statute of limitations period (“Notice”). Actual AI’s address for Notice is: 1730 Sawtelle BLVD, 305, Los Angeles, CA, 90025. The Notice must: (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Actual AI may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Actual AI must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Actual AI will pay you the highest of the following: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (b) the last written settlement amount offered by Actual AI in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (c) $1,000.\n\nE. Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Actual AI will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in the state of Delaware, United States. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Actual AI for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.\n\nF. No Class Actions. YOU AND Actual AI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (OTHER THAN ACTIONS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT OF 2004, CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE § 2698 ET SEQ. WHICH ARE NOT COVERED BY THIS SECTION 14 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION)). Unless both you and Actual AI agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\n\nG. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. If Actual AI makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Actual AI’s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Actual AI’s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and Actual AI. If you do not send such written notice, your continued use of the Service following any such change means that you have consented to such change.\n\nH. Enforceability. If Section 14.F (No Class Actions) is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution) is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution) will be null and void and the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 17 (Governing Law; Choice of Forum) will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Service.\n\nI. Opt Out. Arbitration is not a mandatory condition of these Terms. If you do not want to be subject to this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution), you may opt out of this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution) by notifying Actual AI in writing of your decision by sending, within 30 days of the date you receive these Terms, an electronic message to legal@actual.ai, stating clearly your full name and intent to opt out of this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution). Should you choose not to opt out of this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution) within the 30-day period, you and Actual AI will be bound by the terms of this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution). You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution). You understand that you will not be subject to retaliation if you exercise your right to opt out of coverage under this Section 14 (Dispute Resolution).\n\n15. Cooperation with Authorities. Actual AI may cooperate with legal authorities and/or third parties in the investigation of any suspected or alleged crime or civil wrong. Except as may be expressly limited by the Privacy Policy, Actual AI may disclose any information as Actual AI deems necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post, or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, in Actual AI’s sole discretion.\n\n16. Protected Activity Not Prohibited. To the extent permitted by applicable law, nothing in these Terms will in any way limit or prohibit you from filing a charge or complaint with, or otherwise communicating or cooperating with or participating in, any investigation or proceeding (“Protected Activity”) that may be conducted by any federal, state, or local government agency or commission (“Government Agencies”). In connection with such Protected Activity, you are permitted to disclose documents or other information as permitted by law, and without giving notice to, or receiving authorization from, Actual AI. In making any such disclosures or communications, you agree to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of any information that may constitute Actual AI confidential information to any parties other than the Government Agencies.\n\n17. Governing Law; Choice of Forum. The laws of the State of Delaware, excluding its conflicts of law rules, govern these Terms and your use of the Service. Your use of the Service may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws; provided, however, that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to any provision of these Terms. To the extent that any action relating to any dispute hereunder is permitted to be brought in a court of law, such action will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington and you hereby irrevocably submit to personal jurisdiction in such courts, and waive any defense of inconvenient forum.\n\n18. Feedback. If you provide any feedback to Actual AI concerning the functionality and performance of the Service (including identifying potential errors and improvements), you hereby assign to Actual AI all right, title, and interest in and to such feedback, and Actual AI is free to use such feedback without payment or restriction.\n\n19. Entire Agreement; Variation. These Terms and the Privacy Policy set forth the entire agreement between Actual AI and you with respect to the Service. These Terms supersede and govern all previous oral and written communications regarding these matters, all of which are merged into these Terms. No usage of trade or other regular practice or method of dealing between the parties will be used to modify, interpret, supplement, or alter these Terms.\n\n20. Severability. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such provisions will be modified, or if not possible, severed, to reflect the fullest valid, legal, and enforceable expression of the intent of the parties, and the remainder of these Terms will not be affected thereby.\n\n21. Relationship of Parties. Nothing in these Terms will be deemed to create an employer-employee relationship between Actual AI and you, nor any agency, joint venture, or partnership relationship between the parties. Neither party will have the right to bind the other to any obligation, nor have the right to incur any liability on behalf of the other.\n\n22. Waiver. No delay, omission, or failure to exercise any right or remedy provided under these Terms will be deemed to be a waiver thereof or an acquiescence to the event giving rise to such right or remedy, or a waiver of or acquiescence to any other right, remedy, or event.\n\n23. Assignment. Neither these Terms nor any of the rights granted to you herein may be assigned or transferred by you, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the express prior written permission of Actual AI and any attempt to do so will be null and void. Actual AI may assign or transfer these Terms at any time without your permission.\n\n24. Third-Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of these Terms relating to the rights of Actual AI service providers are intended for the benefit of such service providers, and such service providers, as third-party beneficiaries, will be entitled to enforce such provisions in accordance with these Terms, irrespective of the fact that they are not parties to these Terms.\n\n25. Export Controls. You hereby represent and warrant that: (A) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (B) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.\n\n26. Interpretation. If Actual AI provides a translation of the English language version of these Terms, the translation is provided solely for convenience, and the English version will prevail. Any heading, caption, or section title contained in these Terms is for convenience only, and in no way defines or explains any section or provision. Any use of the term “including” or variations thereof in this Agreement shall be construed as if followed by the phrase “without limitation.”\n\n27. NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA USERS. Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, Actual AI Users located in California are entitled to the following notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 400 R Street, Suite 1080, Sacramento, California 95814, or by telephone at (916) 445-1254 or (800) 952-5210.\n\n28. NOTICE REGARDING Jira, VSCode, and Github. You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Actual AI only, not with other third parties including but not limited to Jira, VSCode or Github, and neither Jira nor Github nor VSCode is responsible for the Service or the content thereof. They have no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Service. In the event of any failure of the Service to conform to any applicable warranty, then you may notify these third-parties and they will refund the purchase price for the relevant Service to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, these third-parties have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Service. These third-parties are not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Service or your possession and/or use of the Service, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Service fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.

You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms when using the Service. These third parties and their subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, these third parties will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary of these Terms. You hereby represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

After TC had taken care of my entire trip to Paris, I had an amazing day with them, one of the best steaks of my life for lunch and at the end, there was an offer that I took immediately.\r\nThe onboarding and the first days were amazing. There is a very positive culture and you feel that the people want to grow something big. Can't wait to put in all the work in order to contribute to the big goal this company has :-)",
