  "summary_markdown": "# About Actual AI\n\nActual AI, operating under SprintReview, Inc., is a company focused on developing artificial intelligence solutions that enhance productivity and decision-making across various industries. The company was founded on June 21, 2024 [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sprintreview-ai). Actual AI aims to provide innovative software solutions that improve the performance and productivity of development teams by moving beyond traditional metrics like story points and lines of code. The company emphasizes creating a more equitable work environment for developers by recognizing and rewarding their actual contributions.\n\nActual AI's primary product is a suite of AI tools designed to assist users in automating tasks, analyzing data, and generating insights to drive business decisions. These tools are built on advanced machine learning algorithms and are intended to be user-friendly, allowing non-technical users to harness AI's power without extensive training. The company serves a diverse range of clients, primarily in the tech industry, who are looking to improve their development processes and enhance team dynamics. Actual AI's business model is primarily B2B, focusing on organizations that value fairness and transparency in performance evaluations.\n\nThe scale of Actual AI in terms of employee count and revenue is not explicitly detailed in the available sources. However, the AI industry is experiencing rapid growth, and companies like Actual AI may be scaling their operations to meet increasing demand for AI solutions. The company promotes a culture of justice and fairness, aiming to create an environment where hard work is acknowledged and rewarded appropriately, reducing biases in performance evaluations.\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nDetails about the leadership team at Actual AI were not provided in the available content. However, the leadership in AI companies often plays a crucial role in shaping the company's vision and strategy, particularly in navigating the complexities of AI ethics, user trust, and technological advancements.\n\n# News\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### New Product Developments\n\n- **AI Companion 2.0**: Zoom launched an upgraded version of its AI assistant, designed to enhance productivity by surfacing important information and automating tasks within the Zoom platform. This development reflects a broader trend in the industry where companies are integrating AI into their existing products to improve user experience and operational efficiency [(Taylor, Zoom News, 2024-10-23)](https://news.zoom.us/ai-companion-2-0-launch/).\n\n- **AI Incident Monitor**: The OECD has initiated the AI Incidents Monitor (AIM) to track AI-related incidents and hazards. This framework aims to provide a reality check on AI incidents, which could inform the development of Actual AI's products by ensuring they align with real-world applications and safety standards [(OECD, 2024-05-01)](https://oecd.ai/en/incidents-methodology).\n\n### Partnerships and Collaborations\n\nActual AI is likely to benefit from partnerships with organizations focused on AI ethics and safety, as seen with the OECD's efforts to create a reporting framework for AI incidents. Collaborating with such entities can enhance Actual AI's credibility and ensure that its products adhere to best practices in AI deployment.\n\n### Fundraising Events\n\nWhile specific fundraising events for Actual AI have not been reported, the overall trend in the AI sector shows significant investment interest. Companies in this space are attracting venture capital to support their growth and innovation efforts, which could be a potential avenue for Actual AI to explore in the future.\n\n## Opinions About the Company\n\nFeedback on Actual AI's products is likely to be mixed, as is common in the AI sector. Users may express concerns about the ethical implications of AI, particularly regarding data privacy and the potential for bias in AI algorithms. The ongoing discussions about \"shadow AI\"—the use of AI tools without formal company approval—highlight the need for companies like Actual AI to address these issues proactively [(Ozarslan, Picus Security, 2025-02-04)](https://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/red-report-2025-3x-rise-in-credential-theft).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nActual AI is positioned within a rapidly evolving industry that presents both opportunities and challenges. The company's focus on developing AI solutions that enhance productivity aligns with broader trends in the market. However, it must navigate ethical considerations and user trust to succeed. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, Actual AI's ability to innovate and adapt will be crucial for its growth and relevance in the market. For prospective candidates and investors, understanding the company's positioning, product offerings, and the broader industry context will be essential for making informed decisions.",

      "# Post ID 16womjf: Is there an actual AI assistant available that will function like a true executive assistant? with +88 score by [(thalos2688, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/16womjf/is_there_an_actual_ai_assistant_available_that/)\nIt seems like every AI app has the word Assistant in it. Yet when I try them they are glorified chatbots or task managers. I’ve used dozens of task managers over the last 20 years, and have settled on one or two that work well for me. But I still have to take the time to enter the tasks, cross off the tasks, manage the tasks, etc. At this point in my life, I am dealing with an overwhelming amount of things to do. Literally hundreds of urgent and/or critical things that need done on the personal and work side at any given time. I am delegating as much as I can, but a lot of them have to be done by me for various reasons. The problem I am having is simply keeping up with everything in a thoughtful and deliberate way. I’ve had the thought several times recently, that if I had a human assistant following me around everywhere, they could take notes on what I need to do, remind me of what needs done, make sure I get things done, pester me about the urgent thing that’s due at a given time etc. Of course I can use alarm apps, but I end up snoozing them because I’m so overwhelmed that I don’t even have time to read the alarm that’s popped up. And yes, I know the real problem is my over-abundance of tasks, not the management of those tasks. It’s just a time in my life where multiple huge projects have converged at once, so it is temporary (another 6 months or so). \n\nDoes anyone know of an App that could act like a human assistant, take notes on what needs to be done, follow up with me to ensure they are done, give suggestions on what to do next, and similar functions? If I have to enter the tasks, edit them, cross them off, etc it has no use for me. I’m already doing that today. I’m looking for an automated virtual assistant that can streamline my life by interacting with me in a natural way. \n\nDoes such a thing exist ?\n\nEDIT: Follow up to this after 10 months. I still haven't found anything, though I think a good solution is imminent. I've been using Rewind.AI (Now Limitless) on my Macbook, which is outstatanding, but only in the context of my desk. I pre-ordered the Limitless Pendant, which is a wearable device that syncs with your iPhone. They just asked me to choose my options so it must be shipping soon. I'm hopefull this will bridge the gap, and at least keep track of everything that needs done during the day.  I'll update this thread with the results.\n\n## Comment ID k2y32iv with +4 score by [(SimRacer101, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/16womjf/is_there_an_actual_ai_assistant_available_that/k2y32iv/) (in reply to ID 16womjf):\nMaybe GPT voice with some amazing pre prompts would be good?\n\n## Comment ID k2zkz7a with +4 score by [(reality_comes, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/16womjf/is_there_an_actual_ai_assistant_available_that/k2zkz7a/) (in reply to ID 16womjf):\nNone.

So it never responds to what you do or organises a counter attack etc.  \n\n\nI tried Graviteam Tactics or whatever it's called but just... no. That's too complicated for me.   \n\n\nI don't really like multiplayer, I have two kids and two businesses so need to be able to play when I can.\n\nCan anyone suggest another game for me?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you!  \nDaniel\n\n## Comment ID ja8inzp with +15 score by [(CrazyOkie, Reddit, 2023-02-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerwargames/comments/11d985c/a_game_like_combat_mission_but_with_actual_ai/ja8inzp/) (in reply to ID 11d985c):\nI don't see it mentioned, and I haven't played it myself but another option is Regiments - it has a lot of fairly positive buzz and it's a strictly single player game.\n\n## Comment ID ja8dj0k with +24 score by [(RektorRicks, Reddit, 2023-02-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerwargames/comments/11d985c/a_game_like_combat_mission_but_with_actual_ai/ja8dj0k/) (in reply to ID 11d985c):\nOne of the main reasons I don't think Combat mission is worth the $60 asking price for their titles is the totally brain-dead AI outside of their pre-generated missions.

Which can whoop your ass quite hard. And there are myriads of them, official ones and custom ones. A scenario can easily take you 4 to 5 hours to play through. Then you have the campaigns which at times are absolutely massive. There is no \"outside of their pre-generated missions\". If you mean the quick battle generator, it is intended for multiplayer. \n\nAlso, the AI in Combat Mission is not all that bad. On a tactical level it is not dynamic and depends on scripts but the actual awareness of the troops, the way it handles spotting and retreating and prioritising targets etc. etc. etc. is actually quite good.\n\n#### Comment ID jai8dqg with +2 score by [(RektorRicks, Reddit, 2023-03-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerwargames/comments/11d985c/a_game_like_combat_mission_but_with_actual_ai/jai8dqg/) (in reply to ID jai358o):\nMy issues with CM are mostly on the UI/Performance/Pricing side, the AI is just tertiary.

No matter how many or how few turns a day (or a week, or a month) you want to play, you'll always find someone who is ok with that pace.\n\nIf you have an ongoing match with 1 turn/day, a couple of them with 3-4 turns a week and a couple of them with 1-2 turns a week, you only need to find a few minutes every day to play one turn, and then you can have longer sessions once in a while.\n\n## Comment ID ja7e9nk with +2 score by [(randolph_sykes, Reddit, 2023-02-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerwargames/comments/11d985c/a_game_like_combat_mission_but_with_actual_ai/ja7e9nk/) (in reply to ID 11d985c):\nCommand Ops 2\n\n### Comment ID ja7eq5h with +4 score by [(danieljamesgillen, Reddit, 2023-02-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerwargames/comments/11d985c/a_game_like_combat_mission_but_with_actual_ai/ja7eq5h/) (in reply to ID ja7e9nk):\nIt seems a little bit too abstract to me.

I think that abstraction somehow also suits the game better - and fired my imagination a bit better. I somehow cared about the units a bit more in the older games - and preferred the UI and control system. \n\nI think the changes made to the original series made it a different game/feel altogether. I think I would be in heaven if someone just remade those original games - sticking largely to the original UI and turn-based ‘wego’ mechanics - but with updated graphics, improved AI, and a dynamic campaign with a strategic map to fight over at the tactical level. \n\nI would give up ridiculous amounts of cash for that game :-)\n\n## Comment ID ja7hzfh with +3 score by [(joseph66hole, Reddit, 2023-02-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerwargames/comments/11d985c/a_game_like_combat_mission_but_with_actual_ai/ja7hzfh/) (in reply to ID 11d985c):\nYou're gonna have to pvp if you want that kind of experience.

Because if it’s the CM-like details you are after along with the ability to exercise “by the book” tactics via sub-squads control, not only do you not have game with “decent AI”, you don’t have ANY games that satisfy the criteria period. Games that do show you individual AFVs (Eugen, Regiments, Armored Brigade) do not attempt to model infantry in a way other than a blob with weapons.

What exactly do you think is complicated, because there is a good chance if you ask about it instead of trying to work it out from the ok-UI or the god-awful manual that it isn't actually that complicated. And there is a lot of things you can mess with that you don't need to understand to start playing and having a good time.\n\nAlso you might want to try Command Ops 2 it has some pretty good AI and is a really good wargame, and  itis free-to-try on Steam. It's not quite what you want, it's a top-down real-time counter based game at a higher operational level but it's really worth a try. Also it's all WW2 scenarios (except for mods and a planned expansion).

Your orders might not always be followed or they might be followed but get bogged down. And while the different order options can seem complicated if at first you stick to the default main orders without editing them then you'll start to pick things up. Remember to stack orders and use delays as well. Like use probe, attack, move, covert move and defend orders without editing them, covers most basic stuff you want to do, when you start noticing they aren't doing what you want or you need to tweak something for your specific plan then look at the order options instead of trying to master the game before playing it if that makes sense.\n\nIs there anything specific you're stuck on in Tank Warfare?

You can basically just use Speech-To-Text or twitch chat to feed messages to something like ChatGPT, and get an output based around a character you define via prompting. That ChatGPT output is then given to a Text-To-Speech. There exists many online.\n\nMost of these services use APIs (Application Programming Interface), which essentially allow you to access things like TTS and ChatGPT from different websites without opening a web browser. You can also run an LLM and TTS locally.\n\nThe motion capture is not too complicated. Vtuber models move via adjusting a range of values. Cameras translate your body movement into these values, but you can also directly adjust these values without motion capture. You can play a loop of pre-made animations or create scripts to adjust these values for dynamic vtuber movement.\n\nThe turtle is the main programmer and dev.\n\nHe created a program that takes input from twitch and voice, gives that input to an LLM, then gives that output to a TTS which is what you hear when Neuro/evil speaks, while anaimations play in a loop. It then becomes a matter of adding more features. It's also not too complicated to have two AI or more running at once. \n\nSource: I made my own.\n\n### Comment ID lv30lrv with +33 score by [(Happy_Bee_8807, Reddit, 2024-11-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/1gi5ra0/someone_help_me_understand_neurosama/lv30lrv/) (in reply to ID lv2y6hs):\nOkay thank you that's exactly what I wanted to know!\n\nYou operate something similar to Neuro sama?\n\n#### Comment ID lv32jnu with +55 score by [(pladis_dev, Reddit, 2024-11-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/1gi5ra0/someone_help_me_understand_neurosama/lv32jnu/) (in reply to ID lv30lrv):\nYep, I haven't updated my YouTube or Reddit much, but here is a clip from a collab my AI (Aiko) had.\n\nhttps://clips.twitch.tv/WanderingCaringDeerDxCat-Qt55xtiGDSoNmDDr\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8Giv5mupJNE?si=OuuI8Y1qawu_VFMG\n\nOr more solo stuff.\n\nhttps://clips.twitch.tv/TriangularAthleticBunnySoonerLater-SXpBk1dFso21VcWD\n\nNot as great as Neuro but It's pretty fun to make all the same.\n\n### Comment ID lv3naxo with +2 score by [(PotatoCleric, Reddit, 2024-11-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/1gi5ra0/someone_help_me_understand_neurosama/lv3naxo/) (in reply to ID lv2y6hs):\nenglish was not my first language and when i reached your last sentence, i got confused. i thought you made your own source. good thing i saw the other comments.\n\ni just find that amusing and shared it. dont mind me\n\n## Comment ID lv2p9yg with +106 score by [(Schizlong, Reddit, 2024-11-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/1gi5ra0/someone_help_me_understand_neurosama/lv2p9yg/) (in reply to ID 1gi5ra0):\nIm gonna be first, so my fact-checking might be not the best concerning details, however I assume that my general knowledge should be accurate\n\nYes, both of the Neuros are ACTUAL AIs, coded by Vedal (the turtle), models were drawn by an indie vtuber called Anny\n\nVedal is the one coding them, improving their capabilities constantly, also making sure that collabs would happen (although Neuro as of now can contact others on Discord on her own) and checking that AIs wont say anything completely out of pocket\n\nSince there arent any people behind Neuros avatars they (avatars) are programmed to show emotions according to context of text being said\n\n### Comment ID lv2v7hd with +58 score by [(UsurpDz, Reddit, 2024-11-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/1gi5ra0/someone_help_me_understand_neurosama/lv2v7hd/) (in reply to ID lv2p9yg):\nDid someone tell vedal there is a problem with her ai?\n\n### Comment ID lv2qugl with +18 score by [(Happy_Bee_8807, Reddit, 2024-11-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/1gi5ra0/someone_help_me_understand_neurosama/lv2qugl/) (in reply to ID lv2p9yg):\nDefine \"contact\", sounds Sci-Fi level shit lol\n\n#### Comment ID lv2s1p9 with +71 score by [(Schizlong, Reddit, 2024-11-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/1gi5ra0/someone_help_me_understand_neurosama/lv2s1p9/) (in reply to ID lv2qugl):\nShe can spam ping people on Discord, as seen [here](https://youtu.be/Ucs-WPOUXJo?t=104) and also call them\n\n#### Comment ID lv2s995 with +21 score by [(Omnimontamer24, Reddit, 2024-11-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/1gi5ra0/someone_help_me_understand_neurosama/lv2s995/) (in reply to ID lv2qugl):\nShe can literally get on Discord and call them is what he means.\n\n#### Comment ID lvlod4w with +5 score by [(TerrapinMagus, Reddit, 2024-11-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/1gi5ra0/someone_help_me_understand_neurosama/lvlod4w/) (in reply to ID lv2qugl):\nVedal's job is basically to make the AIs better at trolling him nonstop.

Multiple AI, mind you, one for the speech and thinking, one for the avatar, one for the gaming part, and many more.\n\nEvil and Neuro are developed by Vedal and some of his friends. He owns the twitch channel, Vedal987, and it has the image of Neuro. He's quote unquote, \"father\" of the two, while there's another Vtuber, AnnyTF, who is considered as the two's quote unquote, \"mother\". The history, as far as I can remember, is that the AI was trained with data derived from Anny and her channel, but I think they've been trained more and more.\n\nTo the third option... Well, he developed this interface, if I can remember, that allows him to interact with the AIs. It's absolutely Vedal's own program. The AI however, runs on the Cloud because it's difficult running them locally. The interaction and everything I assume is automated.\n\nTake this with a grain of salt, I don't remember a lot, all I know is that Evil is cute, so is Neuro, and Vedal is an alcoholic little programming femboy who scored a cute Foxy wife\n\n### Comment ID lv5c5ey with +18 score by [(zexaf, Reddit, 2024-11-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/1gi5ra0/someone_help_me_understand_neurosama/lv5c5ey/) (in reply to ID lv4nhg2):\nAnny came in later.

Then vtubing exploded and Vedal, the turtle/creator decided to create Neuro the vtuber using a generic model he found online and LLM + text to speech.\n\nOver the years she's gone through several iterations that have improved her speech, her awareness, including getting a new model drawn specifically for her by Anny.  She can now interact far more such as being able to detect objects using a camera or on a screen, play a number of games, she can sing, and has started to display a significant level of \"self awareness\" including knowing how to bypass her language filter in a number of ways and actively trolling her creator.\n\nEvil Neuro is essentially a clone of Neuro that has slightly less restrictive filters that Vedal trained to be a bit more aggressive/rude.

I’m pretty sure the original versions of Neurosama actually existed a while before ChatGPT even became a thing, even though a lot of people assume she’s built off of a branch of it, etc.\n\nBut yes afaik they are hand programmed by Vedal and co, I’m pretty sure the model movement is done using the mouse tracking features in VTS along with the lip sync being tied to the TTS (Zentreya does a similar thing). I’m not really sure how the mouse tracking works besides being slightly random which leads to the bouncing they do as well as the weird times when they get “stuck” with their bodies high in the Y position. I assume their toggles are triggered by certain words that are generated (so if they say something sad the “tears” toggle is used, etc).\n\nAs far as how they interact/their personalities, presumably before every stream Vedal tinkers with the prompts to make them remember people/things/etc and have a consistent personality. There’s a lot of movie magic that probably happens behind the scenes to make them feel as human as they do (which is also probably why Vedal never anthropomorphizes them or treats them as real people, lol). \n\nBut yes they are extremely impressive pieces of tech.\n\n### Comment ID lv31kae with +45 score by [(TolarianDropout0, Reddit, 2024-11-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/1gi5ra0/someone_help_me_understand_neurosama/lv31kae/) (in reply to ID lv2ydak):\n>Neurosama actually existed a while before ChatGPT even became a thing\n\nGPT3 was out 2 years before both ChatGPT and Neuro, but it was only an API and not a chat interface, so the general public never noticed.

You can tell a real game from a bot game after they increased the lvl cap. A normal game you have good players on both teams. You can get real games for a fair while, but if you start doing too well consistently all of a sudden you end up in a lobby where everyone else is still lvl 55, your team get destroyed and the enemies shoot you the millisecond you come around a corner and just constantly rain down killstreaks on you. It’s like a punishment for doing too well. Then after your punishment you get a normal lobby where everyone is a different lvl and a different skill lvl. But god forbid you do well again in that lobby or you’ll be back in a lvl 55 bot hellhole again. If I die a few times off the start of the game I’ve just started checking the lvl of the lobby and if it’s a 55 lobby I just walk away while they kill me and come back to a normal lobby after.

This means that people with less skill are placed with easier bots, and people with higher skill are being removed from genuine lobbys and placed with harder bots. I dont know if everyone is affected in this way, but I can clearly tell when my matches go from playing against real people to going to virtually all bots and they are doing impossible gameplay. I have it where the same players are appearing from thin air and doing impossible shots with zero recoil and instant headshots in a fraction of the usual time that it would take a real person to fire. as well as repeating granades in the exact same location multiple times. It usually starts happening after around an hour of gameplay. I even uninstalled the game tonight because I got so fed up with it.

At the end of the day we are making player experiences and the ability to craft that will win out every time.  \n\nMost of ML research is being done by researchers with little to no industry experience.

There are already mods for things like this and they are awesome.  \n\nIt would also be pretty cool to maybe have just a few or maybe even just one questline that has no impact on the main quest but is completely ai generated at every step so that it's unique not only to each individual player but also to each save file.  Something like adding an NPC with a procedurally generated appearance and voice (both of which can be reset if not to your liking by reloading the save before meeting them) with their own procedurally generated backstory, combat style, likes, dislikes, etc.  Something we can also discuss with others and compare.

No. Filler NPCs? Maybe. \n\nI can see a lot of additional depth for games like RPGs if AI voice generation and the like are used to flesh out a world more. I made a similar post the other day about how procedural generation can do the same for terrain generation and stuff. Adding more bulk to something without having to put in as much work as if you were to do it manually. I think a lot of people have too visceral a reaction to the mere mention of AI right now which is understandable, but if used right it really could bring gaming experiences to the next level.\n\nThink about some of the complaints you hear about Bethesda games in regards to the story and world. One common one that I see especially in regards to Skyrim is how little the world and characters actually react to -you- and the things you've done. You're the Dragonborn, the Archmage of the College of Winterhold, the leader of the Companions, the champion of five gods, etc. Not even grand things like that, but what about your race? Where are the comments about you being a Khajiit walking around cities despite them being literally banned from doing so?\n\nTHAT's the sort of thing I think AI generated voice lines and dialogue could be used for to great effect. It would take a lot of work to actually write custom dialogue for so many variables, hence why it's not done, but AI could do it on the fly. The main work that WOULD need to be done is for Bethesda to work their existing dialogue and stuff into the AI so it knows how to mimic it, then make it able to see and pick out the variables of your character, what type of character THEY are, etc.\n\n## Comment ID lyc5ju4 with +7 score by [(kithas, Reddit, 2024-11-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/1gwswhj/would_you_want_to_see_es6_with_actual_ai_npcs/lyc5ju4/) (in reply to ID 1gwswhj):\nThat would lower the meme potential of the game a lot.

      "# [Overview and methodology of the OECD AI Incidents Monitor](https://oecd.ai/en/incidents-methodology)\nOverview\n\nThe AI Incidents Monitor (AIM) was initiated and is being developed by the OECD.AI expert group on AI incidents with the support of the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation. In parallel, the expert group is working on an AI incident reporting framework. The goal of the AIM is to track actual AI incidents and hazards in real time and provide the evidence-base to inform the AI incident reporting framework and related AI policy discussions.\n\nThe AIM is being informed by the work of the expert group on defining AI incidents and associated terminology, such as AI hazards and disasters. In parallel, the AIM seeks to provide a ‘reality check’ to make sure the definition of an AI incident and reporting framework function with real-world AI incidents and hazards.\n\nAs a starting point, AI incidents and hazards reported in reputable international media globally are identified and classified using machine learning models. Similar models are used to classify incidents and hazards into different categories from the OECD Framework for the Classification of AI systems, including their severity, industry, related AI Principle, types of harms and affected stakeholders.\n\nThe analysis is done based on the title, abstract and first few paragraphs of each news article. News articles come from Event Registry, a news intelligence platform that monitors world news and can detect specific event types reported in news articles, with over 150 000 articles English articles processed every day.\n\nWhile recognising the likelihood that these incidents and hazards only represent a subset of all AI incidents and hazards worldwide, these publicly reported incidents and hazards nonetheless provide a useful starting point for building the evidence base.\n\nIncidents and hazards can be composed of one or more news articles covering the same event. To mitigate concerns related to editorial bias and disinformation, each report’s annotations and metadata are extracted from the most reputable news outlet reporting on such incident and hazard based on the Alexa traffic rank. Additionally, incidents and hazards are sorted by the number of articles reporting on them and their relevance to the specific query, as determined by their semantic similarity. Lastly, links to all the articles reporting on a specific incident or hazard are provided for completeness.\n\nThe data collection and analysis for the AIM is done to ensure, to the best extent possible, the reliability, objectivity and quality of the information for AI incidents and hazards. A detailed methodological note is available here.\n\nIn the future, an open submission process may be enabled to complement the AI incidents and hazards information from news articles. To ensure consistency in reporting, the existing classification algorithm could be leveraged to process text submissions and provide a pre-selection of tags for a given incident or hazard report. Additionally, it is expected that incident and hazard information from news articles be complemented by court judgements and decisions of public supervisory authorities wherever they exist.\n\nDefinitions\n\nThanks to the work of the OECD.AI expert group on AI incidents an AI incident and related terminology were defined. Published in May 2024, the paper Defining AI incidents and related terms, defines an event where the development or use of an AI system results in actual harm as an “AI incident”, while an event where the development or use of an AI system is potentially harmful is termed an “AI hazard”.\n\nAn AI incident is an event, circumstance or series of events where the development, use or malfunction of one or more AI systems directly or indirectly leads to any of the following harms:\n\n(a) injury or harm to the health of a person or groups of people;\n\n(b) disruption of the management and operation of critical infrastructure;\n\n(c) violations of human rights or a breach of obligations under the applicable law intended to protect fundamental, labour and intellectual property rights;\n\n(d) harm to property, communities or the environment.\n\nAn AI hazard is an event, circumstance or series of events where the development, use or malfunction of one or more AI systems could plausibly lead to an AI incident, i.e., any of the following harms:\n\n(a) injury or harm to the health of a person or groups of people;\n\n(b) disruption of the management and operation of critical infrastructure;\n\n(c) violations to human rights or a breach of obligations under the applicable law intended to protect fundamental, labour and intellectual property rights;\n\n(d) harm to property, communities or the environment.\n\nInformation Transparency Disclosures\n\nBackground: Your use of the OECD AI Incidents Monitor (“AIM”) is subject to the terms and conditions found at www.oecd.org/termsandconditions.

When such event results in harm or damage it is called an accident. An Artificial Intelligence (AI) incident or hazard refers to an unexpected or unintended event involving AI systems that results in harm, potential harm, or deviations from expected performance, potentially compromising the safety, fairness, or trustworthiness of the AI system in question.\n\nFor the purpose of monitoring AI incidents, Event Registry defines AI as the capability of machines to perform functions typically thought of, or at least thought of in the past, as requiring human intelligence. A system is a structured combination of parts, tools, or techniques that work together to achieve a specific goal or function. An AI system is any system that involves AI, even if it is composed of many other parts. Under these definitions, many systems that are not necessarily thought of as AI in a purely scientific manner, are included. For example, very simple credit scoring system using purely statistical methods can be considered as an AI system as they accomplish the task of determining the credit worthiness of an individual, which has traditionally been accomplished by other humans. Any time that part of a decision-making process is transferred to an algorithm, the system is considered to be an AI system. Other decision tasks where AI systems are involved include product recommendation systems, content moderation, and fraud detection. Similarly to decision tasks, perception tasks were also historically undertaken by humans. These can include tasks such as reading road signs in the context of a driver assistance feature in a car, recognising faces of known people from a surveillance camera, or recognising handwritten addresses in letter or packages for a postal service. Accidents and even incidents involving systems of all kinds are often reported (or forecasted) in the context of news media. Event Registry monitors world news and can detect specific event types reported in news articles, with over 150.000 articles English articles processed every day.\n\nAI incident detection\n\nIn the context of a knowledge base, such as Wikidata [1], events or occurrences can be modelled structurally as statements composed of subjects (items), predicates (properties) and objects (values). To model an event in this structure, consider the following example:\n\nOr, as a triplet: (MH370, instance of, flight disappearance) = (Q15908324, P31, Q104776655)\n\nBut news articles do not include data structured in this way. For the previously mentioned incident of the disappearance of flight MH370, one article stated:\n\nMissing Malaysia Airlines plane: Flight MH370 carrying almost 240 passengers 'disappears' en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.\n\nThe core information of the event is present: It’s a flight, identified by the code MH370, that disappeared. The subject of this story is the “Disappearance of flight MH370”. Although the core information is present in the text, the “subject” hasn’t been explicitly defined in the way knowledge bases expect.\n\nAn alternative way of representing this event can be formulated in terms of the entities involved: (Malaysia Airlines, Incident, Flight MH370)\n\nWith the plain English meaning that Flight MH370 belonging to Malaysia Airlines was involved in an Incident. To bring back the discussion to AI incidents, consider the following sentence:\n\nA Tesla Model S with Autopilot on failed to stop at a T intersection and crashed into a Chevrolet Tahoe parked on a shoulder, killing Naibel Leon, 22.\n\nThis can be modelled as any of the following:\n\n(Tesla, AI Incident, Autopilot): An AI incident involving the company Tesla and its product, the Model S.\n\n(Tesla, AI Incident, Model S): An AI incident involving the company Tesla and its AI System, Autopilot.\n\n(Autopilot, AI Incident, Naibel Leon): An AI incident involving the AI System Autopilot which harmed Naibel Leon.\n\nThis formulation enables Event Registry to frame the problem of detecting an AI Incident as a supervised machine learning task, specifically, a text classification problem: given a sentence, does it express an AI incident involving a given pair of entities?\n\nIn order to classify pairs of entities in a sentence, the entities present in the text need to first be identified. To identify entities in the text, both Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spacy [2] and a separate Entity Detection and Linking system, Wikifier [3] are used. A supervised dataset is then created, which will be used by a learning algorithm to train a machine learning model to perform AI Incident event detection.\n\nModel\n\nThe model used to classify pairs of entities in the context of a sentence is based on a Transformer [4] Neural Network. It uses a BERT-like [5] pretrained language model, RoBERTa [6] to encode the text of a sentence. Before encoding, the sentence text is modified to surround the pair of entities being classified with special tokens and the entity type (e.g. organisation, location, product, …) is added before the beginning of the entity mention. This follows the procedure described in [7] for relation classification. The model architecture itself follows [8]: the transformer encodes the input text, the transformer output embeddings corresponding to the special tokens before each entity are then concatenated together into a single vector which is then passed to a classification head consisting of a linear layer followed by the Softmax activation function to produce a normalised probability distribution over the possible event classes. Notably, what is the probability that the pair of entities in that sentence corresponds to an AI Incident.\n\nDataset\n\nThe problem of detecting an AI Incident is formulated as a supervised machine learning task. The learning process is commonly known training the model. That implies there must be learning examples which are used to learn the parameters of the model. These examples correspond to the model inputs and the associated model targets. As a set of examples, they are commonly called a training set. In order to estimate the performance of the model on unseen data it is necessary to also have a set of examples that are not seen by the model during training. In this case, we call that set of examples the validation set. Examples for training this model includes both positive and negative examples. Positive examples are examples of AI Incidents, while negative examples are not AI incidents. The negative examples were chosen to be semantically similar to positive examples and thus can be considered as “hard examples”.\n\nPerformance metrics\n\nPerformance metrics for classification follow definitions closely linked to statistical hypotheses testing. They are defined in terms of the truth value of the model’s prediction and the value of the target example. A correctly classified examples is called a True Positive (TP) if the corresponding target value is positive, and True Negatives (TN) if the associated target is negative. An incorrectly classified example is called a False Positive (FP) if the example’s target is negative, and a False Negative (FN) if the target is positive. Given a supervised set of examples, it is common to define its performance in terms of relative rates called precision and recall:\n\nSince these two metrics ultimately represent two different types of errors, they are complimentary. When either necessary or desirable to use a single metric that encompasses both types of errors, it is common to use an F-score, typically the F1-score defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall:\n\nIn cases when there are multiple classes beyond just positive and negative, called a multiclass problem, it is common to average class specific F1 scores. There are two common types of averages commonly used: the micro-average which is biased by the class frequency and the macro-average which considers all classes as equally important regardless of their respective frequencies. Averages reported in this document are micro-averages. Metrics are written as percentages and round to the nearest whole number. Experimental results:\n\nCategorisation of AI incidents\n\nAI Incidents are categorised according to several characteristics of the event. Currently, these characteristics are all related to the harm caused. Namely, the level of severity of the incident, the type of harm caused, and the general group to which the harmed parties. The following taxonomy is used for each of these characteristics:\n\nHarm Level:\n\nthe incident resulted in death;\n\nserious but non-fatal physical injury occurred;\n\npsychological, financial, reputational, very minor injury, other;\n\npotential, hypothetical, future harm, threat or unrealised danger;\n\nno harm, not specified, unknown.\n\nHarm Type:\n\nphysical harm to a person or persons, injury or death;\n\nharm to the environment;\n\npsychological harm to a person or group including manipulation, deception, or coercion;\n\nfinancial to a person or organisation;\n\nreputational harm to a person or organisation;\n\nharm to the public interest;\n\nviolation of human or fundamental rights;\n\nno harm, not specified, or unknown.\n\nHarmed Groups:\n\nconsumers, people who own or use the product or service;\n\nworkers, employees or job applicants;\n\na business or businesses or stockholders in the business;\n\nresearchers or scientists;\n\na government, government agencies or officials;\n\nethnic, religious or gender minorities, lower or working class people;\n\nwomen as a gender group;\n\nchildren or minors;\n\npeople with disabilities;\n\nmigrants, foreigners, migrants, refugees, or asylum seekers as a group;\n\npublic, people not otherwise included in this list (e.g. citizens, pedestrians, passers-by, etc.);\n\nunknown, not specified.\n\nLevel and Type are defined as multiclass classification problems, meaning only one of the values can be true for each of them. Multiple groups can be harmed in the same incident and thus it was defined as a multilabel classification problem. Note that the label “unknown” in this case is only used if none of the other groups were identified as being harmed.\n\nModel\n\nThe model for categorising AI incidents is a multitask model with a shared encoder. The encoder is distilroberta-base [9] and each task has a dedicated classification head which uses the output of the transformer corresponding to the special input token “[CLS]“ as in [5]. The input consists of the sentence where the AI Incident was detected, plus the next two sentences.\n\nDataset\n\nThe dataset for categorisation of AI Incidents corresponds to the positive examples in the dataset for detecting AI Incidents.

      "# [A real photo took two honors in an AI competition. Here's the inside story. on 2024-06-24](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/real-photo-ai-competition-flamingone-miles-astray/)\nMiles Astray is a multidisciplinary artist who writes about and photographs the world as he travels. When invited to submit a piece in the artificial intelligence category of the 1839 Awards photography competition, he decided to make a statement.\n\n\"I had seen a few examples over the last couple of years where people had entered AI art into real photography competitions, most notably last year at The Sony World Photo Awards, an AI photo won the creative category there. I thought, why not turn this story around and enter a real photo into an AI competition?\" Astray told CBS News.\n\nThis is Astray's (very real) photo:\n\nTitled \"F L A M I N G O N E,\" the photograph was taken on a trip to Aruba in 2022. It depicts a flamingo scratching its belly in a way that makes the large bird appear almost headless. The image was so striking that it won both third place and the People's Vote Award in the AI category, beating out actual AI creations.\n\n\"Miles' image was just surreal enough to feel like it was created by AI, which gives you an idea of what AI is doing and what kind of imagery we expect,\" Lily Fierman, director and co-founder of Creative Resource Collective, which runs the 1839 Awards, told CBS News.\n\nAI art is typically created by software that interprets a user-given text description, or prompt. The software draws from thousands to millions of reference images to generate digital images, pixel by pixel. While increasingly realistic, many AI-generated images still possess a subtle \"uncanny valley\" quality, appearing not quite right to the human eye.\n\n\"I wanted to show that there is a human and emotional quality here that AI cannot generate,\" said Astray. \"The fact that this picture in the end was chosen not only by the jury, but also by public vote, proved that point and I'm very happy about that.\"\n\nAfter hearing of his win on June 11, Astray notified the contest organizers that his submission was a real photograph. By the next day, he was disqualified from the competition. But the judges and contest organizers expressed appreciation for Astray's message.\n\n\"We never expected somebody to try to enter a non-AI image into AI I think the assumption is it's always the other way around,\" said Fierman. \"Anyone can be fooled by this kind of stuff, let's be real. But also most importantly, at the end of the day, we agree with Miles' statement. In him winning and this happening kind of organically, it gives a message of hope to everyone that nature and the photographer have key places in our world and that just isn't something that computers or AI can replicate.\"\n\nIn response to the photographic win, the photo contest added a note that \"only images created by AI may be submitted to the AI category.\"\n\nAstray, unfazed by his disqualification, acknowledges that a time may soon come when AI-generated art becomes virtually identical to real photographs: \"It has gotten to the point where there are some pictures that are just like, indistinguishable from a real photograph. So that technology is there, and that's not going to go away.\"",
      "# [Missouri S&T – News and Events – AI will change your future by Peter Ehrhard, Missouri University of Science on 2024-11-13](https://news.mst.edu/2024/11/ai-will-change-your-future/)\nArtificial intelligence is here to stay, along with all its controversies, questions and ambiguity. It is rising in the workplace and changing the way we work. Many researchers have looked at potential downsides, but few have looked at the upsides.\n\nWe interviewed three Missouri S&T faculty members with expertise in different academic disciplines and asked them about AI’s future, how accepted it is by the general public, how it will interplay with the economy and the ethical implications of its use.\n\nThe economy will be affected\n\nThe consensus among Missouri S&T experts is that, while the economy will change, disruptions will be counterbalanced by new opportunities.\n\n“AI will not gain the general human capabilities within 20 years,” says Dr. Donald Wunsch, director of the Kummer Institute Center for Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Systems and the Mary Finley Professor of electrical and computer engineering at S&T. “There will continue to be workforce changes, in blue- and white-collar positions. Certain current low-paid jobs will become much more valuable, and other six-or-seven figure jobs may be taken over by AI. For example, future AI can achieve higher performance than a hedge fund manager. But people won’t trust an AI babysitter.”\n\nDr. Daniel Shank, an associate professor of psychological science at S&T, echoed Wunsch’s opinion.\n\n“I’m not convinced that mass layoffs due to AI are likely, even industry-wide ones, at least in the near future,” says Shank. “AI is good at supplementing processes and automating boring parts of tasks, but as it has done so industries adapt – finding different uses for humans versus AI.”\n\nWriting, music, movies and art – traditional humanities fields – are the ones often featured in the media when it comes to AI producing and creating. Many fear that these areas will be reduced to little interaction from humans. But work will continue as it always has, just in different and new ways.\n\n“Chatbots and large language models are an incredible development, and we are only at the beginning of seeing what can happen with it,” says Dr. Darin Finke, teaching professor of philosophy at Missouri S&T. “But the history of AI is a history of over-hyping. Every time there appears to be a new technological breakthrough concerning AI, the exaggerated predictions follow.”\n\nHow soon will you work with AI?\n\nOne day, the technology may eventually grow to the point that it can provide many functions in society. Are there any industries that are safe, such as teaching, medicine, hairstyling or plumbing? Would people be accepting of working or interacting alongside a fully AI co-worker in a chatbot role, a graphic designer or a taxi driver?\n\n“I don’t think most people have experiences with AIs or robots as coworkers,” says Shank. “Even when AIs and robots take human jobs, people tend to see them as tools or as ways to augment their own work.”\n\nShank says that there are still, even today, some tasks that AI or robots can do much better than humans, but humans continue to do them.\n\n“In terms of automated systems, especially when there are options for humans or machines, both the wide acceptance, performance and personal preferences come into play,” says Shank. “So there might be a base level of acceptance or preference, so the same person might be terrified to ride in an autonomous vehicle but also rather talk to a chatbot about a banking issue.\n\n“In some industries, there might be cases of sudden shifts shaking up employment arrangements,” Shank continues. “For example, automated vehicles and human taxi drivers is a case where a lot of conflict is being seen, including legal issues.”\n\nWunsch also believes that the time when individual robots can replace an individual person is still far off.\n\n“If all drivers were AI, the problem would be much easier, because humans are bad drivers. But people won’t accept that. I would accept a driverless car moving slowly in a predictable environment, like a golf cart or certain factories – but not on typical roadways,” says Wunsch. “The main problem is with unpredictability. The general principle applies – the more carefully a problem can be specified, the more likely an AI solution might be helpful; and that still leaves a lot of room to apply AI.”\n\nCan we ethically shape AI use?\n\nCould human-to-human interaction in general potentially become rarer in the future? Or maybe the opposite will happen, because with more time and tasks eased, perhaps individuals will be allowed to put more time and effort into volunteerism or other fulfilling activities. Jobs will always exist, but the workplace, job market and whole industries may one day change beyond recognition.\n\n“For years now, organizational task-only human-to-human interaction has been decreasing,” says Shank. “We don’t have to have people for every financial transaction and for every service. There are consequences to not having long-term exposure to people in different transactional arenas like fast food. But people’s meaningful personal relationships are much more important to maintain than their exposure to human fast-food servers.”\n\nThe impact on jobs could lead to a question of ethics on new scales, Finke says. “New technology will always be slightly ahead of the ethics related to that technology,” says Finke. “And then the ethicists try to play catch-up.”\n\nSo how does ethics connect to the world of AI? Often, history has the answer – with a similar panic happening during the industrialization of farming and large-scale machine work. Modern questions may be more along the lines of if an AI-generated piece of art can be “owned,” or if someone would allow AI to teach their child in a classroom.\n\n“With the rise of digital technology over the past two decades, many philosophy programs across the country have responded by developing courses and degrees specifically related to digital and AI ethics, which are relatively new fields,” says Finke. “The next steps not only include further developing digital and AI ethics, but also figuring out, or framing, other non-ethical issues related to that technology.\n\n“For instance, can the output of ChatGPT be original? Can it really be creative? Who owns that output? Can it be copyrighted?” Finke asks. “AI technology is already being used in art and photography competitions, so questions of authorship and creativity, and even legality, seem to arise when writers or artists or poets or academics, or whoever, utilize AI in their works.”\n\nA new cold war\n\nAnother aspect of the future of AI is the disparity between countries’ economies. Would a lack of infrastructure affect growth in certain areas of the world? Could AI lessen the gap between the world’s rich and poor or could it worsen it?\n\n“AI will bring us closer to either utopia or dystopia, and the decisions we make now will influence on which outcome is achieved,” says Wunsch. “We need to be responsive to the extraordinary level of international competition in AI”\n\nIf governments take a more passive role in AI use or development, then it may fall to companies to battle for the commanding heights of the economy. Perhaps there will be new major tech companies emerging, or the current large companies growing along with AI.\n\n“The arms races with AI are more company-based than country-based, and countries seem to be struggling to keep up in terms of laws, taxes, trade agreements and policies to guide the ethical use of AI,” says Shank. “On the other hand, there is some uneven distribution.”\n\nShank says that only a handful of companies in the world can train the most advanced AI large-language models that use statistical models to analyze and understand text like the currently popular ChatGPT. But once trained it can be distributed and integrated into products easily and used by people anywhere.\n\nAs for a race to the top, Wunsch agrees that it has already started and could continue to escalate.\n\n“AI growth between countries will remain a race,” says Wunsch. “There will still be a lot of room for innovation from unpredictable sources, particularly in the mathematics of AI.”\n\nWunsch also says that he believes that the political and economic impacts of AI will be tremendous. He hopes that political leaders reach out to the subject matter experts instead of listening to all the noise about AI – some of which is even produced by AI itself.\n\n“Stakes are high, with much pressure for regulation, some of which is misaligned with actual AI opportunities and threats. Our leaders must seek expert input that is aligned with constituents’ interests,” says Wunsch. “Many coastal AI experts influencing policy miss key issues that affect diverse elements of society and opportunities for disruptive innovation. In some cases, they prefer to suppress it. And expert opinions differ widely, thus the need to seek local viewpoints.”\n\nAbout Missouri S&T",

That app was painfully crude and mutilating to audio and essentially failed.\n\niZotopeRX has a wow & flutter module but this is just pure trial and error. It's useful here and there but leads to labor of love level of work. At least you can get results with fidelity intact whereas Capstan didn't work at all with that caveat.\n\nI don't mean to fully dismiss the crude stuff. It still has relevance in broadcast. Hitting the surface but still lo-fi results aren't just nothing!\n\nBut since we have the ability to manipulate audio speed fully losslessly when we need to with Elastique Pro in Reaper (this is classic veri-speed linked speed/time work here), where are all the fancy new \"AI\" assisted tools?!

No?\n\nAnyway, if anyone has any tips on automated speed restoration tools. Except I'm only interested in full fidelity preservation with no exceptions. All the karaoke aimed stuff is kind of automatically off the table there.\n\nThink about recordings that are an adventure in generational copies. The bias whistle, mains hum, and a few other artifacts from later generations are stable but the original recording buried in that is not. Being able to select any component of the recording for reference would be needed.\n\nReaper, Elastique Pro, and stretch markers ARE perfect! But not automated.

      "# [Five Tips For Overcoming AI Fatigue by Russ Kennedy on 2024-11-26](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/11/26/five-tips-for-overcoming-ai-fatigue/)\nRuss Kennedy is Chief Product Officer at Nasuni.\n\nThe amount of AI washing happening in the enterprise world is maddening. Walk through any airport today and the ads would leave you convinced every company on the planet is now an AI leader.\n\nOn top of all this marketing misdirection, we're overwhelmed by legitimate AI news. The actual AI leaders are releasing new models weekly. It's hard enough to keep up with what Microsoft or Google alone are doing, let alone every other major and minor player. Finding the signals in all this noise is exhausting.\n\nThe temptation is to ignore it all and focus entirely on the traditional problems and challenges your business faces. Yet giving in to AI fatigue is a bad idea for your organization. There are too many opportunities. You are going to fall behind if you don't advance the use of AI within your enterprise.\n\nHere are five suggestions for overcoming AI fatigue and making real, measurable progress:\n\nOwn the strategy.\n\nIn a recent study, Gartner found that 13% of CEOs are driving their organization's generative AI strategy.\n\nOn some level, this makes perfect sense. These are very technical tools, so the inclination is to leave it to the technical leaders to figure out how to deploy them. But, to me, this is a missed opportunity. That same Gartner report found that 44% of CEOs had used ChatGPT in the first half of 2023. Furthermore, they'd used it in their jobs, not just while helping their kids with homework.\n\nThis disparity is striking. If you have experimented with these tools, you know how powerful they can be, so you shouldn't be sitting in the back seat. You should be demonstrating their productive potential yourself and leading your organization’s adoption. Furthermore, you should assume an active role in shaping your organization's AI strategy.\n\nThankfully, the first step is simple.\n\nDitch the blanket.\n\nMany companies have instituted blanket bans on AI tools within their organization for security reasons.\n\nBased on what I've learned in working with enterprises—and my experience with my own company—I'd bet that if you anonymously polled your employees, somewhere around 90% of your people would admit to using AI. Your people are already using these tools. Banning AI is only going to encourage shadow IT.\n\nWith a blanket ban, you also lose out on the chance to understand how AI might help your organization in surprising or unexpected ways. You make it taboo for people to inform their colleagues about these small wins and how a product might be useful in accomplishing some mundane or time-consuming task.\n\nThose productivity gains will never spread if they are a secret.\n\nBuild a sandbox.\n\nThe urge to ban made sense at the start. We didn't know enough about how AI tools worked. But today it is possible to deploy officially sanctioned and security-corralled AI tools with the appropriate governance and controls. So, I'd suggest picking a few tools, getting your security leaders to put the proper wrappers around them, configuring the models so they can't train on your data and then encouraging widespread use.\n\nBy building a secure, enterprise-approved sandbox, you can let your employees experiment and uncover those benefits and gains. Plus, you will be able to retain any related IP inside the business. Let's say one of your employees wants to explore a subject relating to a customer's business. If you have a blanket ban on AI, she might slip outside the corporate network and interact with an LLM, asking questions and bouncing around ideas as she would with a colleague. Once she's done, however, those ideas are not your organization's property. You lose the institutional learning associated with the study.\n\nBut if you've sanctioned AI apps, then all that back and forth becomes IP retained within the business. She could add colleagues to the brainstorming session as well. These rich interactions become company property that other employees can access and build on.\n\nDemand real results.\n\nAs more employees test and experiment with approved tools, you should have a plan in place to track and measure the results. A level of play should be encouraged, but it should all be focused on productivity and real, measurable gains. Institutionalize regular check-ins and reports to capture anecdotal feedback, too. You should work to understand how people feel these tools are impacting their daily work and interactions with colleagues.\n\nYou're not running an AI-washing marketing campaign. Your goal is to find out what actually works for your business. If something isn't making a positive impact after a predetermined time, move on. Pour your efforts and resources into another AI service or tool instead.\n\nTrack AI with AI.\n\nFinally, at a high level, you do need to track what is happening out there in the world of AI development because the space is moving so fast. A new tool might emerge that is perfectly suited to the needs of your organization.\n\nThe waterfall of information can be completely overwhelming, so I'd suggest using AI itself to monitor these developments. If someone suggests an interesting podcast or video lecture on new trends or tools, consider letting an AI tool summarize the content for you to save yourself time. Subscribing to a few short, digestible, AI-focused newsletters is advisable, too.\n\nBelieve me, I understand the fatigue, but this technology will drastically impact your organization. Exactly how it will do so may still be unclear, but if you suppress the urge to pull back and instead take an active role in driving your organization's strategy, both you and your business will be in a much better position to succeed in the years ahead.",
      "# [Shadow AI: how employees are leading the charge in AI adoption and putting company data at risk](https://www.cyberhaven.com/blog/shadow-ai-how-employees-are-leading-the-charge-in-ai-adoption-and-putting-company-data-at-risk)\nSimilar to the early days of cloud adoption, workers are using AI tools ahead of IT departments formally buying them. The result is “shadow AI,” employee usage of AI tools through personal accounts that are not sanctioned by—or even known to—the company.\n\nShadow AI carries inherent risks to the confidentiality and integrity of company data because AI systems typically assimilate the information provided to them, incorporating these inputs into their broader knowledge base. Companies have already noted that the substance of sensitive information workers put into ChatGPT has been inadvertently shared with external parties.\n\nUnderstanding how material generated by AI is used within organizations is equally important because this content may be inaccurate, inadvertently infringe on copyrights or trademarks, or include security vulnerabilities, especially concerning when AI-generated code is involved.\n\nThe Q2 2024 AI Adoption and Risk Report from Cyberhaven Labs (download a free copy here) explores these trends. It's based on actual AI usage patterns of 3 million workers, providing an unprecedented lens through which we can examine the adoption and security implications of AI in the corporate environment.\n\nGrowth in AI usage and the top 25 AI tools\n\nAI usage at work is increasing at an exponential rate and so is the amount of corporate data pasted or uploaded to AI tools. Between March 2023 and March 2024, the amount of corporate data workers put into AI tools increased by 485 percent. AI adoption has increased so much so fast that the average knowledge worker now puts more corporate data into AI tools on a Saturday or Sunday than they did during the middle of the work week a year ago.\n\nChatGPT, which ignited the AI boom in November of 2022, remains the most frequently used AI application in the workplace. A “big three” set of vendors has emerged over the past year to dominate the AI landscape: collectively, products from OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft account for 96.0% of AI usage at work. But we’re still in the early stages of the AI revolution, and numerous startups also feature prominently on the top 25 AI tools list.\n\n{{ promo }}\n\nAI adoption by industry\n\nThe industry with the greatest AI adoption is technology. Across every dimension, workers at tech firms use AI more than their counterparts in other fields. In March 2024, 23.6% of tech workers put corporate data into an AI tool. They also put data into AI tools more frequently (2,007,102 events per 100,000 employees) and copy data from AI tools more frequently (1,664,821 events per 100,000 employees) than workers in any other industry.\n\nWe’re still early in the adoption curve with 5.2% of employees at media and entertainment firms, 4.7% of employees at financial firms, and 2.8% in pharmaceuticals and life sciences are putting company data in AI tools. Retail and manufacturing employees have much lower adoption rates of AI technology than other industries. Just 0.6% of workers at manufacturing firms and 0.5% of workers at retail firms put company data in AI in March 2024.\n\nNotably, workers in media and entertainment copy 261.2% more data from AI tools than they put into them. We found that in media, a growing amount of news content is generated using AI. We found a similar pattern in professional services (e.g. law firms, consulting firms, etc.) where workers copy 73.3% more data from AI tools than they put into them. Management consultants in particular are using AI to prepare presentation slides and other client-facing materials.\n\n“Shadow AI” is growing faster than IT can keep up\n\n“Shadow AI” is AI usage among workers that the company’s IT and security function does not sanction or in some cases even know about.\n\nOpenAI launched an enterprise version of ChatGPT in August 2023 with enhanced security safeguards and a guarantee that information from corporate customers won’t be used to train models used by the general public (which can leak the substance of the training data). According to OpenAI, 80% of Fortune 500 companies have teams using ChatGPT with corporate accounts. However, we found a significant majority are still personal accounts.\n\nIn the workplace, 73.8% of ChatGPT accounts are non-corporate ones that lack the security and privacy controls of ChatGPT Enterprise. Moreover, the percentage is even higher for Gemini (94.4%) and Bard (95.9%). As companies adopt enterprise versions of popular tools and for key use cases and migrate users to corporate accounts, more AI startups launch and end users are adopting new AI tools faster than IT can keep up, fueling continued growth in “shadow AI”.\n\nWhat corporate data workers put into AI tools\n\nAI adoption is reaching new departments and use cases involving data that shouldn’t be exposed outside the company. While the overall volume of corporate data bound of AI has increased significantly over the past year, the percentage of that data that is sensitive has risen significantly as well. In March 2024, 27.4% of corporate data employees put into AI tools was sensitive, up from 10.7% a year ago. The variety of this data has also grown.\n\nThe top sensitive data type put into AI tools is customer support (16.3% of sensitive data), which includes confidential information customers share in support tickets. Source code comprises another 12.7% of sensitive data bound for AI. It’s important to note this number does not include coding copilots built into developer environments; it represents source code a developer copies and pastes into a third-party AI tool, which is riskier than corporate sanctioned copilots.\n\nResearch and development material is 10.8% of sensitive data flowing to AI. This category includes results from R&D tests that in the wrong hands would provide insights to competitors working on competing products. Once new products get closer to launch, marketing teams begin to work on promotional materials. Unreleased marketing material forms 6.6% of data, and confidential internal communications also forms 6.6% of data.\n\nHR and employee records are 3.9% of sensitive information going to AI, including confidential HR details such as employee compensation and medical issues. Financial documents are just 2.3% of sensitive data going into AI tools but this material can be especially damaging if it leaks since it includes unreleased financials for public companies.\n\nSensitive data flows to “shadow AI”\n\nJust how much sensitive data is going to these non-corporate AI accounts?\n\nWhile legal documents comprise only 2.4% of sensitive corporate data going to AI tools, the vast majority (82.8%) are put into risky “shadow AI” accounts. Legal documents include drafts of acquisition or merger contracts for proposed deals, settlement agreements with confidential deal terms, and legal materials protected by attorney-client privilege.\n\nRoughly half of source code (50.8%), research and development materials (55.3%), and HR and employees records (49.%) put into AI are going to non-corporate accounts.\n\nInterestingly, we found that the most common form of sensitive company data going to AI tools is also most likely to be used with approved, corporate AI accounts. Just 8.5% of customer support information put into AI tools is going to non-corporate accounts.\n\nHow AI-generated content is used at work\n\nIt’s equally important to look at where AI-generated material is being used within organizations—not only from a security and legal standpoint but also to understand the impact AI is having on different types of work. We measured for every category of data at a company, how much is being created using AI.\n\nFrom its origin in an AI tool, we traced where AI-generated content went within companies and found that the destination with the highest percentage of AI content is professional networks at 5.1%. In other words, roughly one in 20 LinkedIn posts employees create while at work are made using AI. However, other material from AI is being used in more business-critical ways.\n\nIn March 2024, 3.4% of research and development materials were produced using AI, potentially creating risk if patented or inaccurate material was introduced.\n\nThat was followed by 3.2% of source code insertions. Like in prior parts of this report this number only covers third-party AI tools not coding copilots built into development environments. The actual amount of source code being created with AI tools is likely much higher. But third-party AI tools often don’t have the same controls to prevent malicious code.\n\nWe also found that 3.0% of graphics and design content originated from AI, which can be a problem since AI tools can output trademarked material.\n\nA smaller but still meaningful amount of news and media material (1.1%), which includes written news articles, is made using AI. We found the same percentage for job boards and recruiting material, which includes online job descriptions, originating in AI tools.\n\n‍",
      "# [Here’s AI’s actual plan for Big Brother 26 twists by Andy Dehnart, Chuck S, Kyle B on 2024-07-10](https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2024/07/bb26-ai-theme-twists-plan/)\nCBS announced Big Brother 26’s twist today, and as many people correctly guessed from hints host Julie Chen Moonves revealed, it involves AI. That’s perfect for Big Brother, which like AI, is something no one really wants or needs but is forced upon us because some massive company needs even more profit to make its wealthy shareholders feel better.\n\nYes, Big Brother, a show known for its forward thinking and refusal to just stay in a well-worn rut, has surprised us by thinking outside of the box.\n\nJust read this quotation attributed to both of Big Brother’s executive producers and architects of expect the unexpected cliche chaos, Allison Grodner and Rich Meehan. They said:\n\n“From summer camp, to tech, to the multiverse, Big Brother loves to put a twist on topical and pop culture themes. This summer’s ‘BB AI’ theme promises to bring the fun, the comedy and the unexpected game play that is a hallmark of Big Brother.”\n\nAh yes, summer camp and the multiverse: two super-topical pop culture themes, or at least words that appear that way to people who are completely disconnected from pop culture.\n\nSo for BB26, CBS said, “’Big Brother Artificial Intelligence,’ known as ‘BB AI,’ is taking over the House and the theme will deliver the most unpredictable season for Houseguests.”\n\nLook at them, being all unpredictable by choosing the most predictable theme possible!\n\nBig Brother is following the lead of Netflix’s The Circle, which just concluded its sixth season this spring. That show had an actual AI player, one that was actually trained on past seasons of The Circle so it could accurately mimic a player—which it did, becoming 26-year-old veterinarian intern Max.\n\nWill Big Brother also spend money on its own AI model? Or will this just be a thin excuse for the producers to manipulate the game and pretend it’s AI?\n\nWe have a clue in the BB26 house design; CBS said its “Bedrooms were ‘created’ using the following ‘BB AI’ prompts.” The scare quotes around “created” tell me all I need to know about the fact that “Create a refreshing retreat for the Head of Household” did not actually produce the HOH room’s design, which was likely once again designed by Scott Storey and his team.\n\nAs usual, this theme announcement tells us very little. But since we now all have access to generative AI, I thought I’d ask our new robot overlords what exactly they’d do with this season.\n\nSince they’re effectively “plagiarism machines,” sucking up everyone’s intellectual property and then remixing it with no concern for reality, they seem perfect for the job of producing Big Brother, taking others’ ideas and delivering them to us in a way that pretends it’s new.\n\nWhat would AI really do with BB26?\n\nIn order to do this right, I gave it very little thought and spent just a few minutes on it, which seems to be the modus operandi for Big Brother.\n\nThe big question was how long of a season I wanted generate AI to generate. The show starts next week, a very late start for a normal year. The last season to start this late was BB14, and it lasted 75 days, through late September. So, I went with 75 days.\n\nHere are the instructions I gave to ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo, using DuckDuckGo’s version, which is anonymous and collects no data:\n\nI’d like you to be the producer of Big Brother. Using past seasons as a guide, create a 10-week outline for the show, describing different gameplay twists that occur each week, and also creating two challenges each week, one for Head of Household and one for the Power of Veto. You may also throw in other random twists and challenges.\n\nAll of this should connect to the theme for the season is “BIG BROTHER Artificial Intelligence” or “BBAI.” The brief you’ve given CBS is that “BBAI is taking over the House and the theme will deliver the most unpredictable season for Houseguests,” so make sure to deliver on that brief—though about four weeks in, abandon that theme completely, like the show usually does.\n\nHere is what it came up with. Brace yourselves and expect the unexpected!\n\nWeek 1:\n\nGameplay Twist: The first twist of the season is the “AI Takeover.” The houseguests are informed that an AI system will be controlling certain aspects of the game, such as challenges and rewards.\n\nHOH Challenge: “Code Breaker” – Houseguests must solve a series of puzzles related to AI concepts to become the first Head of Household.\n\nPOV Challenge: “Algorithm Escape” – Houseguests race against the clock to solve a complex algorithm puzzle to win the Power of Veto.\n\nWeek 2:\n\nGameplay Twist: “Data Overload” – Houseguests are bombarded with information about each other, leading to paranoia and strategic gameplay.\n\nHOH Challenge: “Memory Matrix” – Houseguests must memorize a sequence of flashing lights and replicate it to become the new Head of Household.\n\nPOV Challenge: “Encryption Challenge” – Houseguests must decode a message hidden in a series of encrypted clues to win the Power of Veto.\n\nWeek 3:\n\nGameplay Twist: “Virtual Reality Showdown” – Houseguests compete in challenges using virtual reality technology.\n\nHOH Challenge: “VR Maze Runner” – Houseguests navigate a virtual maze to win the Head of Household title.\n\nPOV Challenge: “Cyber Duel” – Houseguests face off in a virtual sword-fighting challenge to secure the Power of Veto.\n\nWeek 4:\n\nGameplay Twist: “AI Rebellion” – The AI system malfunctions, causing chaos in the house and disrupting the game.\n\nHOH Challenge: “AI Shutdown” – Houseguests must deactivate rogue AI bots in a timed challenge to become the new Head of Household.\n\nPOV Challenge: “Tech Glitch” – Houseguests compete in a challenge where technical malfunctions randomly occur, adding an unpredictable element to the Power of Veto competition.\n\nWeek 5:\n\nGameplay Twist: “Secret Alliance” – Houseguests are secretly paired up with another player and must work together without revealing their alliance.\n\nHOH Challenge: “Partner Puzzle” – Houseguests must solve a puzzle with their secret partner to win the Head of Household title.\n\nPOV Challenge: “Trust Test” – Houseguests must decide whether to trust their secret partner or go solo in a challenge to win the Power of Veto.\n\nWeek 6:\n\nGameplay Twist: “Double Eviction” – Two houseguests will be evicted in a single night, increasing the stakes and intensity of the game.\n\nHOH Challenge: “Fast Forward” – Houseguests compete in a rapid-fire quiz challenge to determine the new Head of Household.\n\nPOV Challenge: “Double Trouble” – Houseguests face off in a high-pressure competition where the winner can save both themselves and another nominee from eviction.\n\nWeek 7:\n\nGameplay Twist: “Time Warp” – Houseguests are transported back in time to relive a pivotal moment from earlier in the season, with the opportunity to change the course of the game.\n\nHOH Challenge: “Rewind Race” – Houseguests must race against the clock to recreate a past challenge and secure the Head of Household title.\n\nPOV Challenge: “Temporal Puzzle” – Houseguests solve a time-based puzzle to win the Power of Veto and potentially alter the game’s trajectory.\n\nWeek 8:\n\nGameplay Twist: “Identity Swap” – Houseguests are randomly assigned new identities and must adapt to their new personas in the game.\n\nHOH Challenge: “Persona Puzzle” – Houseguests must correctly match their new identities with corresponding clues to win the Head of Household competition.\n\nPOV Challenge: “Alias Alliance” – Houseguests work together in pairs based on their new identities to compete for the Power of Veto.\n\nWeek 9:\n\nGameplay Twist: “Final Showdown” – Houseguests face off in a series of epic challenges to secure their spot in the final weeks of the game.\n\nHOH Challenge: “Ultimate Endurance” – Houseguests compete in a grueling endurance challenge to become the Head of Household.\n\nPOV Challenge: “Last Chance” – Houseguests battle it out in a high-stakes competition for the Power of Veto, with the power to change the course of the game.\n\nWeek 10:\n\nGameplay Twist: “Game Changer” – A surprise twist is introduced that completely shifts the dynamics of the game and sets the stage for the final showdown.\n\nHOH Challenge: “Final Battle” – Houseguests compete in a winner-takes-all challenge to determine the last Head of Household of the season.\n\nPOV Challenge: “Final Veto” – The remaining houseguests face off in a high-pressure competition for the Power of Veto, with the power to secure their spot in the final stages of the game.\n\nChatGPT ended its outline with a sentence that said it was “maintaining the unpredictability and excitement that Big Brother is known for,” so now we really know AI is full of shit and has absolutely no idea what it’s talking about.\n\nThat said, I have a strong feeling that several of the things in this list will actually happen. Perhaps I’ll track them, or perhaps I’ll get bored of/frustrated by Big Brother as usual. Who can tell? Oh! AI.\n\nDo you think I’ll be able to track Big Brother’s twists this season, or will I get bored of/frustrated by Big Brother as usual?\n\nIt’s hard to predict how you’ll feel about Big Brother this season. Some viewers enjoy following the twists and turns of the show, while others may get bored or frustrated with certain aspects. It ultimately depends on your personal preferences and how the season unfolds.",
      "# [Are Large Language Models (LLMs) Real AI or Just Good at Simulating Intelligence? • AI Blog by Artificial Intelligence Blog on 2024-05-24](https://www.artificial-intelligence.blog/ai-news/are-large-language-models-llms-real-ai-or-just-good-at-simulating-intelligence)\nIn the world of artificial intelligence, few topics generate as much discussion and debate as the nature of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4. As these models become increasingly sophisticated, the question arises: are LLMs actual AI, or are they simply good at simulating intelligence? To answer this, we need to delve into what constitutes “real” AI, how LLMs function, and the nuances of intelligence itself.\n\nDefining “Real” AI\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad term encompassing various technologies designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, perception, and even creativity. AI can be categorized into two main types: Narrow AI and General AI.\n\nNarrow AI: These systems are designed and trained for a specific task. Examples include recommendation algorithms, image recognition systems, and, yes, LLMs. Narrow AI can outperform humans in their specific domains but lack general intelligence.\n\nGeneral AI: This type of AI, also known as Strong AI, possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, mimicking human cognitive abilities. General AI remains theoretical at this point, as no system has achieved this level of comprehensive intelligence.\n\nThe Mechanics of LLMs\n\nLLMs, such as GPT-4, are a subset of narrow AI. They are trained on vast amounts of text data from the internet, learning patterns, structures, and meanings of language. The training process involves adjusting billions of parameters within a neural network to predict the next word in a sequence, effectively enabling the model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.\n\nHere’s a simplified breakdown of how LLMs work:\n\nData Collection: LLMs are trained on diverse datasets containing text from books, articles, websites, and other written sources.\n\nTraining: Using techniques like supervised learning and reinforcement learning, LLMs adjust their internal parameters to minimize prediction errors.\n\nInference: Once trained, LLMs can generate text, translate languages, answer questions, and perform other language-related tasks based on the patterns learned during training.\n\nSimulation vs. Genuine Intelligence\n\nThe debate about whether LLMs are genuinely intelligent hinges on the distinction between simulating intelligence and possessing it.\n\nSimulation of Intelligence: LLMs are incredibly adept at mimicking human-like responses. They generate text that appears thoughtful, contextually appropriate, and sometimes creative. However, this simulation is based on recognizing patterns in data rather than understanding or reasoning.\n\nPossession of Intelligence: Genuine intelligence implies an understanding of the world, self-awareness, and the ability to reason and apply knowledge across diverse contexts. LLMs lack these qualities. They do not possess consciousness or comprehension; their outputs are the result of statistical correlations learned during training.\n\nThe Turing Test and Beyond\n\nOne way to evaluate AI’s intelligence is the Turing Test, proposed by Alan Turing. If an AI can engage in a conversation indistinguishable from a human, it passes the test. Many LLMs can pass simplified versions of the Turing Test, leading some to argue they are intelligent. However, critics point out that passing this test does not equate to true understanding or consciousness.\n\nPractical Applications and Limitations\n\nLLMs have shown remarkable utility in various fields, from automating customer service to assisting in creative writing. They excel at tasks involving language generation and comprehension. However, they have limitations:\n\nLack of Understanding: LLMs do not understand context or content. They cannot form opinions or comprehend abstract concepts.\n\nBias and Errors: They can perpetuate biases present in training data and sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical information.\n\nDependence on Data: Their capabilities are limited to the scope of their training data. They cannot reason beyond the patterns they have learned.\n\nLLMs represent a significant advancement in AI technology, demonstrating remarkable proficiency in simulating human-like text generation. However, they do not possess true intelligence. They are sophisticated tools designed to perform specific tasks within the realm of natural language processing. The distinction between simulating intelligence and possessing it remains clear: LLMs are not conscious entities capable of understanding or reasoning in the human sense. They are, nonetheless, powerful examples of narrow AI, showcasing the potential and limits of current AI technology.\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, the line between simulation and genuine intelligence may blur further. For now, LLMs stand as a testament to the remarkable achievements possible through advanced machine learning techniques, even if they are just simulating the appearance of intelligence.",

      "# [Red Report 2025: A 3X Increase in Credential Theft While AI Threats Stay More Hype Than Harm by Suleyman Ozarslan, PhD on 2025-02-04](https://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/red-report-2025-3x-rise-in-credential-theft)\nFor years, the cybersecurity headlines have been dominated by news of sophisticated phishing campaigns and zero-day exploits. But behind these attention-grabbers lurks a far more subtle and explosive evolution in adversarial behavior. Today, we are proud to introduce the Red Report 2025, the fifth edition of our annual threat analysis from Picus Labs. This year’s key revelation? A massive uptick in infostealing malware and multi-stage “heist-style” campaigns that are pushing the boundaries of stealth and persistence, while actual AI-driven attacks remain more hype than reality.\n\nFrom Infostealers to AI Myths: 2025’s Cyber Threat Reality Check\n\nThe Red Report 2025 is based on an analysis of over 1 million real world malware samples collected throughout 2024. These samples revealed more than 14 million malicious actions, 93% of which were related to the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK® techniques. We call these the top ten due to their consistent use by adversaries, underscoring how vital they are to attackers’ efforts to infiltrate and burrow deep into a victim’s environment.\n\nKey Data Points at a Glance:\n\nA 3X increase in malware targeting credentials stored in password vaults and managers\n\n93% of all malicious actions mapped to just 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques\n\nNo significant use of AI, yet, in real-world malware campaigns\n\nRise of “SneakThief” style infostealers that rely on stealth, automation, and persistence\n\nMalware now executes an average of 14 malicious actions\n\nThe Red Report 2025\n\nThe 10 Most Prevalent MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n\nUsed by Adversaries\n\nRed Report 2025 in Numbers\n\nMeet “SneakThief” and the Art of the Perfect Heist\n\nThis year’s report shines a spotlight on a new wave of infostealer malware we’ve dubbed “SneakThief,” infamous for an attack sequence so effective it’s been likened to “The Perfect Heist.” While the name is fictitious, the techniques are alarmingly real: multi-stage infiltration, advanced process injection, secure channel exfiltration, and boot persistence. The result? An attacker’s dream scenario where precious credentials—and entire networks—can be siphoned off without actually tripping any alarm bells.\n\nCredentials: The Crown Jewels\n\nOne of the most alarming shifts we uncovered is a 3X surge in malware that specifically targets credential stores, such as password managers and browser-stored login data. In fact, 25% of the malware examined last year exhibited behaviors mapped to T1555 (Credentials from Password Stores). This means threat actors aren’t just prying open your vault, they’re going after the master keys inside. Once they snag your credentials, lateral movement and privilege escalation within your environment are practically guaranteed.\n\nThe Top 10 Techniques Driving Cybercrime\n\nIt’s easy to get overwhelmed by the hundreds of MITRE ATT&CK techniques out there in the wild. But if you were to focus on just the top 10, you’d have addressed 93% of the malware activity we observed in 2024. Of these, T1055 (Process Injection) stands out with a 31% prevalence rate, enabling attackers to hide malicious code in legitimate processes. Other heavy hitters include T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) for malicious scripting, T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) for encrypted exfiltration, and T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution) for its persistence through reboots. Together, they form the backbone of modern cyber heists.\n\nDebunking the Myth: AI-Driven Malware Not Yet a Real Threat\n\nAmid a seemingly never ending media frenzy, our findings actually show no evidence of AI-driven malware playing a significant role in active cyber campaigns. Attackers do leverage AI-like capabilities for tasks such as creating realistic phishing lures or debugging malicious code, but we haven’t seen new or disruptive AI-based attack vectors. Oh it’s coming, but for now, the “dark AI” storyline remains more fiction than fact.\n\nWhy Your Security Priorities Need to Shift\n\nCredential theft, encrypted data exfiltration, and stealthy process injection underscore a clear directive for defenders: traditional patchwork defenses, where disparate tools and processes operate in isolation, simply aren’t enough. Organizations need continuous security validation, advanced behavioral monitoring, and a threat-informed strategy that focuses on the TTPs most favored by attackers. Proactive alignment of your defenses to the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques can dramatically reduce the real-world impact of threats like SneakThief.\n\nGet the Full Story\n\nThe Red Report 2025 goes beyond threat statistics and highlights the exact ways attackers execute high-stakes exfiltrations of enterprise data. It also provides actionable insights for defenders, including:\n\nThreat-informed defense strategies to align your security controls to adversaries’ top TTPs\n\nBest practices for credential hardening and multi-factor authentication\n\nHow to detect and more importantly disrupt Stealth + Persistence combos\n\nReal-world examples of “The Perfect Heist,” so you can learn from others before it’s too late",

      "# [5 new AI roles for PR pros by Allison Carter, Jennifer Jones-Mitchell on 2024-09-16](https://www.prdaily.com/5-new-ai-roles-for-pr-pros/)\nJennifer Jones-Mitchell offers team trainings and AI consulting through Human Driven AI.\n\nAI won’t take your job. Someone who knows how to use AI will. This is how I begin my AI trainings and consulting sessions. And it is true. If you aren’t upskilling in generative AI, you will fall behind. But there is an even more compelling trend when it comes to AI and jobs: new employment opportunities for PR professionals. Yes, you read that right. For all the talk about AI taking jobs, it is also creating new ones. Here are the five new AI roles for PR pros:\n\nAI Trainer. This can cover two areas: training people to use AI ethically and effectively and/or training the actual AI models. I have a colleague who has twenty-five years of corporate communications experience. She no longer works in PR. She’s now employed by the world’s largest tech company, teaching their AI models to communicate like humans.\n\nAs companies and agencies continue to develop custom LLMs, or AI Agents, they need to teach these models to communicate with employees, customers and all stakeholders effectively. The more human-like AI behaves, the better the models perform overall.\n\nRequirements: In addition to knowing how to structure training data for AI systems, this role requires an understanding of brand messaging, offerings, customer personas, and their needs, so the AI engages stakeholders with on-brand communication. In other words, it is the perfect position for an experienced PR professional. I expect we will see many folks pivoting to this kind of role.\n\nPrompt Engineer. As prompting becomes increasingly more complex, this is a critical position for PR pros. In fact, the job itself is a natural progression for many of us. Most people write a single prompt and run with that output. But when you understand how to talk to AI models, you can create multi-step prompt sequences that achieve multi-step tasks. You can even train AI models to remember these sequences so other team members can run them when needed.\n\nRequirements: While this role requires an understanding of how to talk to Generative AI, I predict a need for vertically aligned prompt engineers. The prompts you create for highly regulated industries like healthcare, banking and insurance differ significantly from the prompts you’d create for a CPG brand versus a B2B brand and so on. There is a need for experts who understand specific vertical markets and can craft compelling prompts that serve those markets.\n\nIn fact, PR agencies should plan to have prompt engineers on staff by 2025. This will be critical to keep pace with this evolving technology while ensuring agency teams utilize Generative AI ethically and effectively.\n\nGenerative Design Specialists. This position is like a prompt engineer but focuses on visual design. I’ve seen this role gain popularity across fields like architecture, product design and engineering.\n\nRequirements: The way in which you instruct image generators differs from the way you instruct text generators. Understanding these differences is critical for design-focused professionals. Similarly, there is an increasing need for a category-specific understanding of how to direct Generative AI to achieve common design tasks, including complex prompt sequences. Because Generative AI can be used to create limitless design variations, experts are needed to develop the precise prompts and refine outputs to achieve optimal designs based on the categories they serve.\n\nInput/Output Managers. This role is one level up from a prompt engineer and it’s more of a strategic position that oversees the information your teams are uploading into AI models and the quality of the outputs the models deliver.\n\nAs companies and agencies continue to grapple with considerations around data privacy, copyright, AI explainability and bias, this quality control position ensures employees adhere to policies and guidelines. This position should be prepared to audit all forms of content – including written articles, visual designs, and analysis reports. Human reviewers are critical assess the quality, accuracy, and appropriateness of content. So, while we will undoubtedly see Generative AI used to create more content, we still need humans to ensure that content is fit for the intended purpose.\n\nRequirements: The position requires someone with a real attention for detail and an ability to translate business requirements into technical specifications. The best candidates possess excellent written and verbal communication skills and have experience creating documentation and user guides, making this a terrific role for PR professionals. The role would conduct tasks like random spot-checks on what teams are inputting into AI – including the prompts they’re using, and to ensure they aren’t sharing proprietary IP with AI systems. The position also reviews AI-generated outputs to ensure consistent and effective human review and revision. In other words, they make sure AI creates the first draft, not the final draft.\n\nAI Personality Designer. This fun role will be in-demand in 2025. As more companies release new Generative AI models and brands create custom LLMs, it will be increasingly necessary for differentiation.\n\nProfessionals will teach AI models to possess distinct personalities that separate them from the competition. This could be an LLM with a sarcastic sense of humor, or one that offers motherly guidance, or an LLM that understands how to connect with the LGBTQ community. We’ve already seen similar examples of this. Last year, Latimer.ai hit the scene, an LLM trained exclusively on content from the HBCUs to help brands connect more authentically to people of color.\n\nAs the market floods with different AI models, differentiation through unique personalities will be key. And there is no one better to train these models than PR professionals who already know how to write, speak and create in the distinct voices and personalities of various brands.\n\nThe bottom line is this: AI is changing not only the way we do our work, but the work we do. Generative AI delivers opportunities for PR professionals to automate common tasks, augment skills gaps, drive personalization at scale and enhance audience engagement. But AI is just a tool. It still requires humans to drive it. And humans are creating new jobs to do just that."
