  "summary_markdown": "# About CodeIntegrity\n\n**CodeIntegrity** is a security feature integrated into Microsoft Windows, designed to ensure that only trusted code is executed on a system. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the operating system by enforcing policies that restrict the execution of untrusted or malicious software. This feature is part of a broader suite of security measures that Microsoft has implemented to protect users from various cyber threats.\n\n- **Founded**: January 1, 2024 [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/codeintegrity).\n- **Employees**: Specific employee numbers for CodeIntegrity are not publicly available, but it is a feature of Microsoft Windows, which has over 1.5 billion active devices worldwide.\n- **Products and Services**: CodeIntegrity focuses on application control and code integrity verification, utilizing policies to determine which applications are allowed to run, thereby preventing unauthorized code execution. Key features include User Mode Code Integrity (UMCI), Dynamic Code Security, and Policy Management.\n- **Revenue and Scale**: As a feature of Microsoft Windows, CodeIntegrity benefits from the extensive user base of over 1.5 billion active devices, underscoring its importance in maintaining system security across various environments.\n- **Distribution**: CodeIntegrity is distributed as part of the Microsoft Windows operating system.\n- **Company Evolution**: CodeIntegrity has evolved as part of Microsoft's ongoing efforts to enhance security measures within its operating systems, adapting to new threats and user needs.\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nWhile specific details about the leadership team of CodeIntegrity are not provided, it is a feature developed and maintained by Microsoft, a company known for its experienced professionals in technology and business management.\n\n# News\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Vulnerability Mitigation\nA recent update addressed a vulnerability (CVE-2024-21302) in Windows that could allow an attacker with administrator privileges to replace updated system files with older versions, potentially bypassing Virtualization-based security (VBS) features. Microsoft responded by updating the SkuSiPolicy.p7b policy, which is crucial for blocking vulnerable system files from being loaded [(Microsoft, Support, August 13, 2024)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/guidance-for-blocking-rollback-of-virtualization-based-security-vbs-related-security-updates-b2e7ebf4-f64d-4884-a390-38d63171b8d3).\n\n### Transition to Trusted Signing\nThe Device Guard Signing Service (DGSSv2) is being deprecated, and users are encouraged to transition to the Trusted Signing service for code integrity policy signing. This change is expected to enhance the security of code signing processes and requires users to have an Azure account for access [(Microsoft, Learn, September 11, 2024)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/trusted-signing/how-to-device-guard-signing-service-migration).\n\n## Executive Insights\nMicrosoft has emphasized the importance of CodeIntegrity in its security strategy. As stated in a recent article, \"The introduction of robust application control mechanisms like CodeIntegrity is essential in today's threat landscape, where attackers continuously seek to exploit vulnerabilities\" [(Microsoft, Cybersecurity Insights, 2024)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/10/08/file-hosting-services-misused-for-identity-phishing/).\n\n## User Feedback and Opinions\nFeedback on CodeIntegrity from various forums indicates mixed sentiment. While many users appreciate the added security, some have reported challenges with compatibility and policy management. A common theme in discussions is the need for better tools to manage and deploy CodeIntegrity policies effectively, as users have found the existing tools to be somewhat cumbersome [(Reddit, User Feedback, 2024)](cache://reddit/1).\n\n## Major Changes\n- **Policy Updates**: The recent updates to the SkuSiPolicy.p7b policy are significant, as they address vulnerabilities that could compromise system integrity.\n- **Service Transition**: The shift from DGSSv2 to Trusted Signing marks a strategic change in how Microsoft handles code signing, aiming to enhance security and streamline processes for users.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nCodeIntegrity is a vital component of Microsoft's security framework, designed to protect users from executing untrusted code. With ongoing updates and a focus on improving user experience, it remains a critical tool for organizations looking to enhance their cybersecurity posture. As the threat landscape evolves, so too will the features and capabilities of CodeIntegrity, ensuring it continues to meet the needs of its extensive user base. Understanding the significance of CodeIntegrity within Microsoft's broader security strategy is essential, as it reflects the company's commitment to maintaining a secure computing environment for all users.",

      "# Post ID 16oov9d: Is anyone actually successfully deploying WDAC as a replacement for AppLocker? with +20 score by [(RiceeeChrispies, Reddit, 2023-09-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/16oov9d/is_anyone_actually_successfully_deploying_wdac_as/)\nI'm looking at introducing application whitelisting to an organisation, and I'm currently in the evaluation stage - looking at both AppLocker and Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC).\n\nWhilst I'd love to go for Windows Defender Application Control, I'm finding it incredibly difficult to successfully implement. This is mainly around policy building, whilst using the WDAC Wizard.\n\nThe WDAC Wizard looks like a savour for policy creation, but I'm finding it impossible to add trusted publishers and/or file hashes reliably. Every time I attempt to add, it states a 'successful' build - but it never actually appears in the XML. If it does, when I update the XML - it fails to retain the rules and strips them out in some cases. It's just not reliable. \n\nOn the other hand - with AppLocker, I can simply create in local group policy and export as XML to be ingested as a Custom-URI into Intune.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike I said, I'd love to go with what Microsoft is pushing (seeing as 'App Control for Business' is in preview). but I'm finding it hard to justify WDAC over AppLocker - it seems half-baked. Am I missing something here or is it just cumbersome?\n\n## Comment ID k1n978h with +25 score by [(FlibblesHexEyes, Reddit, 2023-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/16oov9d/is_anyone_actually_successfully_deploying_wdac_as/k1n978h/) (in reply to ID 16oov9d):\nWe use a combo of both WDAC and AppLocker.\n\nWe started off with AppLocker, but we found that we were constantly editing \\~6 policies to cater for all the software that a user might have installed. If the user wasn't authorised by an AAD group to have that software, we were instructed to ensure it's blocked.\n\nSo, enter WDAC. This allows us to \"stack\" policies using supplemental policies that we apply based on user group membership.\n\n**WDAC**\n\nOur base policy - all users and devices get this policy:\n\n* turns on HVCI/Core Isolation\n* adds the Microsoft code signing certificates to an allowlist\n* enables enforcement\n* explicitly enables scripts - AppLocker takes care of scripts (see below)\n\nWe then throw on a supplemental policy to enable execution in:\n\n* C:\\\\Windows\n* C:\\\\Program Files\n* C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\n\nWe add these because I bricked so many VM's, that rebuilding them or restoring from snapshots was getting tedious :D\n\nFor developers we have another WDAC policy that allows executables in the C:\\\\Users directory. For standard users, it's normally blocked.\n\nWe then add a separate WDAC policy for any apps that for some reason can only be installed in the user profile. I hate these apps.\n\nAll these policies were built using the command line tools. I found the wizard annoying and troublesome.\n\nI recommend keeping all your policies in source control so you have a managed backup of them somewhere. You should do the same for any scripts you write.\n\n**AppLocker**\n\nMSI's are blocked with an AppLocker policy. This is applied via AppLocker to prevent a user from running MSI's, but allow local admins to allow them.\n\nAn EXE policy is applied to all users to block:\n\n* fsquirt.exe to block Bluetooth file transfers\n* other undesirable apps that no user dev or otherwise should be running (such as Zoom - it's banned in our org)\n\nScripts are blocked using AppLocker - this policy is separate from the others as we have a requirement for some users to run scripts. It's tied to an AAD group.\n\n**Implementation**\n\n1. Collect a list of all applications out there in your environment and evaluate which ones you need and which ones can be tossed.\n2. Implement them into Intune. We want to get to a point where the only method for installing apps is via the Company Portal. Use HyperV for testing so you can take snapshots and roll back if needed.\n3. Start implementing application control policies in audit mode only. Collect logs.\n4. Test, test, test. And when you think you've done enough testing, go back to step 4 :D\n5. Take a snapshot of your test VM, and apply the policies in enforce mode.\n6. Test to ensure you can install all apps from the Company Portal, and that they all run as expected - you may need to bring in other users to your test group if they have specific needs (we have an app that downloads more exe's for execution only after sign in - which I don't have, because it's far above my pay grade).\n7. Rollout. Slowly.\n\nThis is the culmination of almost a years worth of work. It won't happen over night, and I had so many false starts and errors and \"throw my hands up in the air and give up\" moments, while trying to design and build this that I think I went prematurely grey.\n\nThough once you get the procedures down, it's actually not that difficult to do.\n\nIf you've got any questions, feel free to ask :)\n\n### Comment ID ktrb8l3 with +4 score by [(GetFreeCash, Reddit, 2024-03-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/16oov9d/is_anyone_actually_successfully_deploying_wdac_as/ktrb8l3/) (in reply to ID k1n978h):\nI'm very late to this thread but I wanted to thank you again for the info you've shared here! love when folks share their best practices on this subreddit.\n\n### Comment ID koitl0m with +2 score by [(ArcherAdmin, Reddit, 2024-02-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/16oov9d/is_anyone_actually_successfully_deploying_wdac_as/koitl0m/) (in reply to ID k1n978h):\nAmazing thank you for this.

So I cheat by blocking it in AppLocker which is separate to WDAC. To the end user the result is the same.\n\nFor Zoom and others; these apps are banned by company policy, and under normal circumstances they are blocked; but because we have a “dev” WDAC policy that whitelists C:\\Users\\* (so devs can run code inside their profile), we need an AppLocker policy to block devs from being able to run Zoom inside their profile.\n\n### Comment ID l0qvago with +1 score by [(CrispyTheGoat, Reddit, 2024-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/16oov9d/is_anyone_actually_successfully_deploying_wdac_as/l0qvago/) (in reply to ID k1n978h):\nHey - Sorry to resurect this post a little, but how did you deal with going through the logs?\n\nI am doing a similar thing, but we are enabling managed installer and the smartlocker/ISG. The problem is the standard logs (3076 for audit policies) do not consider the managed installer or ISG, so more stuff appears as \"would be blocked\" than in actual reality.\n\nI confirmed this with testing, and given the whole point of the managed installer and ISG features is to not have to list everything you need to run, it feels like I am missing something.\n\nI know there are  3091 and 3092 events I can enable, but they don't ever seem to be generated... But 3090 events are generating just fine...\n\n#### Comment ID l0srg0s with +2 score by [(FlibblesHexEyes, Reddit, 2024-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/16oov9d/is_anyone_actually_successfully_deploying_wdac_as/l0srg0s/) (in reply to ID l0qvago):\nAll good in the necromancy :)\n\nWe actually completely disabled ISG so that there would be no way for an app to run unless it met our rules.\n\nWith it enabled, I still had users able to install Firefox for example.\n\nWe deal with PII and some PHI, so it was imperative that we only allow specific apps to run.\n\nFor your testing; I suggest a similar approach. Apply your policies to a VM with ISG disabled, and test that your rules work. You should also start getting the events you need since nothing will be trusted by ISG. You can always enable ISG in your prod policy if you still need it.\n\nI’d only enable ISG if you’re happy for your users to run any EXE they want (obviously so long as it has a good reputation). So if you’re implementing WDAC to prevent shadow IT, or unlicensed apps, ISG should be disabled.\n\n### Comment ID lgchru3 with +1 score by [(not-halsey, Reddit, 2024-08-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/16oov9d/is_anyone_actually_successfully_deploying_wdac_as/lgchru3/) (in reply to ID k1n978h):\nWaking up an old thread here again: but when you whitelist those 3 directories in your supplemental policy, do you disable Runtime Filepath Rule Protection? \n\nMicrosoft makes this complicated because it will block a whitelisted folder path if it finds an unrecognized SID in the folder permissions.

The GUID needs to be entered with the curly braces around the GUID.\n\nThese two policies form our baseline WDAC policy. These apply to ALL machines in Intune.\n\nOn top of those two policies, I build polices for any apps that need a WDAC policy to allow them to run (for example; Postman runs in the user profile and so needs an exception).\n\nTo create those policies, I go to a device that has no WDAC enabled (a VM or Windows Sandbox are suitable for this), and I install the app as normal.\n\nI'll then scan the directory the app was installed to in order to collect the thumbprints for each file's code signing certificate.\n\nTo scan the directory and collect the certificates, I run:\n```powershell\nNew-CIPolicy -FilePath $XMLPolicyOutputPath -ScanPath $ScanPath -UserPEs -Level Publisher -NoShadowCopy -Verbose\n```\nWhere ``$XMLPolicyOutputPath`` is the path that your XML policy will be written to (including the .xml extension), and where ``$ScanPath`` is the directory you want to scan for code certificates.\n\nThe scan may take some time depending on the size of the installation directory.\n\nOnce complete, run the following command to link the new policy to the base policy:\n```powershell\nSet-CIPolicyIdInfo -FilePath $XMLPolicyOutputPath -PolicyName \"Supplemental - $PolicyName\" -SupplementsBasePolicyID $BasePolicyID -BasePolicyToSupplementPath $BasePolicyPath\n```\nWhere ``$PolicyName`` is a friendly name for the policy, ``$BasePolicyID`` is the GUID from the base policy (including curly braces), and ``$BasePolicyPath`` is the path to your base policy XML.\n\nYou then need to convert all of the policy files to p7b files to allow it to be deployed. Run the following command for the base policy, the supplemental policy, and the new policy:\n```powershell\nConvertFrom-CIPolicy -XmlFilePath $XMLPolicyOutputPath -BinaryFilePath $BinPolicyOutputPath\n```\nWhere $BinPolicyOutputPath is the location (including the extension .p7b) to output the binary policy file.\n\nOnce done, you should have three .p7b files - one for each policy file.\n\nGet the ``PolicyID`` for all two base line policies, and then in a custom Intune policy create OMA-URI entries like the following:\n* OMA-URI: ./Vendor/MSFT/ApplicationControl/Policies/$PolicyID/Policy\n* Data type: Base64 (file)\n* Upload the file: $BinPolicyOutputPath\n\nThis Intune policy would apply to all users.\n\nCreate a second custom Intune policy like the above, but for the third WDAC policy. This policy would only apply to those users who have that particular software installed.\n\n#### Comment ID ls3f8e8 with +1 score by [(Apprehensive_Gur_36, Reddit, 2024-10-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/16oov9d/is_anyone_actually_successfully_deploying_wdac_as/ls3f8e8/) (in reply to ID li6dm0v):\nI experienced the same issue here as well, mainly used the WDAC wizard to create relevant allow rules, I have whitelisted the Program Files and Windows folder and I am still getting that apps from those folders did not meet the Enterprise signing level requirements or violated code integrity policy.

I have 2 questions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Can we have two Custom OMA-URI settings for the same type of file? Example I wanna add 2 settings for allowed .EXEs, one for all the .EXE Windows uses and another for the programs we allowed users to use.\n\nI tried adding 2 settings\n\n./Vendor/MSFT/AppLocker/EnterpriseDataProtection/Group01/EXE/Policy < Here I added Windows' .EXE\n\n&#x200B;\n\n./Vendor/MSFT/AppLocker/EnterpriseDataProtection/Group02/EXE/Policy < Here I added all other .EXE (Chrome, Word, etc)\n\nBut when the user gets the profile, their computer locks them out with a black screen, as if everything was blocked. Am I doing something wrong? Or is it no possible to add 2 settings for .EXE and everything has to in one custom OMA-URI?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Since I had no luck with above, I tried to implementing a custom Code Integrity policy using a \"golden build\". I followed a guide online that is now gone, but luckily I saved the steps. First I needed to create the CI policy by scanning the golden build with the following command.\n\nNew-CIPolicy -Level FilePublisher -FilePath C:\\\\MyCIPolicy\\\\My\\_Initial\\_CI\\_Policy.xml -ScanPath C:\\\\ -UserPEs -Fallback Hash\n\nThen you have to convert it from XML to .bin with the following command\n\nConvertFrom-CIPolicy -XmlFilePath C:\\\\MyCIPolicy\\\\My\\_Initial\\_CI\\_Policy.xml -BinaryFilePath C:\\\\MyCIPolicy\\\\My\\_Initial\\_CI\\_Policy\\_Audit\\_Mode.bin\n\nNow here where the problems start, the guide says to change the file extension from .bin to .p7b and upload it to Intune as follows\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Enter the OMA-URI (we got this from our CSP tree) **./Vendor/MSFT/AppLocker/ApplicationLaunchRestrictions/CodeIntegrityGroup/CodeIntegrity/Policy**\n* Select **Base64 (file)**\n* Click the upload folder and locate your **SIPolicy.p7b** and upload.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem is that Intune does not recognizes .p7b as compatible file to upload, one of the compatible file extension is .cer so I converted to it using the certutil\n\ncertutil -encode SIPolicy.p7b SIPolicy.cer\n\nAfter doing so am I able to upload the file to Intune, but saving the profile gives me this error message\n\nUnable to save due to invalid data. Update your data then try again: The field Value must be a string or array type with a maximum length of '1000000'.Name\n\nAny ideas what am I doing wrong??? Any help is appreciated.\n\n## Comment ID ewgclc0 with +5 score by [(VRDRF, Reddit, 2019-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/co55y4/help_with_applocker_and_intune/ewgclc0/) (in reply to ID co55y4):\nI'm not sure if intune handles it the same as AD does but in AD you have to create default rules that allow .exe files to run from for example the windows directory, if you don't it assumes everything is blocked apart from the .exe files you did allow.

I think it's the mandatory reboot as u/Rudyooms discusses that is the cause. I've already allowed managed installers and the company portal works with deploying user-based apps. The only apps that get pushed at the point it's failing are device-wide, and it trips up on (0/1 apps). Sadly some apps we user are only available as MSI installs and without greater control on when the WiDAC policy hits, I've changed course:\n\nPreviously (and in the failing state) device group (AutopilotDevices-ComputingLabPCs) was targeted by the WiDAC profile. Since the computer is pre-enrolled and auto-added (via static add to group in AutoPilot enrollment) I know it will exist (see the woes of dynamic group refresh periods). That does mean that as soon as the computer re-registers with MDM (either through autopilot reset, fresh start or from a bare metal \"retail\" OS install in the OOBE state, it starts getting profiles and therein lies the rub.\n\nWhat I've changed to is targeting the policy at a device group that is statically populated which means we must delist that computer as a member before a AP Reset/Fresh Start/Bare metal, so that the complete enrollment process can take place, and then (and only then) add the computer to the \"enforce WiDAC\" group. It breaks end-user resets, but since we don't allow that anyway, it \"works\" enough. Do I like it? No. A bit of a kludge? Absolutely. Can I live with it? Yes, I've got bigger fish to fry.\n\n#### Comment ID iddan67 with +1 score by [(Pl4nty, Reddit, 2022-06-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/vhfhx1/mdacwidac_breaking_autopilot/iddan67/) (in reply to ID idanfn1):\nGlad to hear you have a workaround. Afaik WDAC doesn't actually require a reboot to apply - Managed Installer policies need the target exe to be restarted though (I restart the IME service).

I haven't verified any of this yet though - will add to the blog post I'm writing.",

I have applied a known good config profile to  my Multi-session AVD and they report back as 'Not applicable' (whereas succeed and are applied to physical device).\n\nMy thinking is that I need to use the WDAC .admx option via the settings catalog (once filtered to Multi-session AVD) to manage this. I have created a basic filedrop win32 app to get the .bin policy file onto the local disk (confirmed that works, and confirmed access to local system account) and set the location of the .bin via the .admx in the config profile (reports succeeded), yet still cannot get the device to process the configuration and apply the Code Integrity Policy.\n\nAny thoughts on what I am missing or doing wrong? Has anyone got this working in this use case?\n\nThanks\n\nEdit 1: I have tested with single and multi-policy formats, as single-policy format is required for deployment via .admx.\n\nEdit 2: Reddit is strange, who downvotes a question where legitimate effort is shown?\n\nEdit 3: I've been able to get this working by following M$'s guidance on [WDAC deployment via script](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/deployment/deploy-wdac-policies-with-script), then packaging that .ps1 as a Win32 app and deploying to my devices.\n\n## Comment ID ifjtuzf with +3 score by [(Pl4nty, Reddit, 2022-07-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/vtnrlq/wdac_and_multisession_azure_virtual_desktops/ifjtuzf/) (in reply to ID vtnrlq):\nI believe OMA-URIs are tagged as unsupported for multi-session, so Intune won't try (returns not applicable) even if the underlying CSP works.\n\nSilly question, but has the host been rebooted?

It’ll get you most of the way there. Very similar to ASR where you incorporate audit data to not flag the good stuff. \n\nYou can kinda get away with some stuff with Intune installing things but it’s good to veer on the side of caution. \n\nOne thing I have come across is .dll enforcement (I have apps that are definitely whitelisted but failing to run due to event 3114) - open to ideas on that one.\n\n### Comment ID mdle4nx with +1 score by [(Rich_While_8837, Reddit, 2025-02-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/1it0qde/wdac/mdle4nx/) (in reply to ID mdl9kzs):\nThanks mate!\n\n## Comment ID mdl23ot with +1 score by [(Rin-rs, Reddit, 2025-02-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/1it0qde/wdac/mdl23ot/) (in reply to ID 1it0qde):\nThis article has some good information that will get you started - https://call4cloud.nl/configure-deploy-wdac-application-control-mdag/\n\nMy general approach has always been to deploy a policy in audit mode, review what would have been blocked through advanced threat hunting logs, export the logs as a CSV and identify what should be allowed to run, and merge into the parent policy. It is important the policy id stays the same, but you increment the version through wdac wizard.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/operations/querying-application-control-events-centrally-using-advanced-hunting\n\n### Comment ID mdl4pis with +3 score by [(Rudyooms, Reddit, 2025-02-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/1it0qde/wdac/mdl4pis/) (in reply to ID mdl23ot):\nYep... even when i wrote that blog myself... applocker is still way easier to implement and maintain\n\n### Comment ID mdl2y6o with +1 score by [(Rich_While_8837, Reddit, 2025-02-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/1it0qde/wdac/mdl2y6o/) (in reply to ID mdl23ot):\nThanks!\n\n#### Comment ID mdl2z2b with +1 score by [(exclaim_bot, Reddit, 2025-02-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/1it0qde/wdac/mdl2z2b/) (in reply to ID mdl2y6o):\n>Thanks!\n\nYou're welcome!\n\n### Comment ID mdl418k with +1 score by [(darkkid85, Reddit, 2025-02-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/1it0qde/wdac/mdl418k/) (in reply to ID mdl23ot):\nGood one, bookmarking this\n\n## Comment ID mdlh6il with +1 score by [(SkipToTheEndpoint, Reddit, 2025-02-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/1it0qde/wdac/mdlh6il/) (in reply to ID 1it0qde):\n> Applocker is not an option anymore, because this is also not updated anymore.\n\nIt's \"feature complete\", but still completely supported.

Your PC will still work, but we recommend moving to Windows 11.\n\nLearn more\n\nImportant note about the SkuSiPolicy.p7b policy\n\nThe SkuSiPolicy.p7b policy has been updated. You should apply the updated policy by installing the latest Windows update released on or after January 2025. For instructions to apply the updated policy, see the Deploying a Microsoft-signed revocation policy (SkuSiPolicy.p7b) section.\n\nIn this article\n\nSummary\n\nScope of Impact\n\nAvailable mitigations\n\nUnderstanding mitigation risks\n\nMitigation deployment guidelines\n\nDeploying an audit mode policy\n\nDeploying a Microsoft-signed revocation policy (SkuSiPolicy.p7b)\n\nUpdating external boot media\n\nWindows Event logs\n\nPolicy activation events\n\nAudit and block events\n\nPolicy removal and recovery procedure\n\n​​​​​​​Changes made to this article​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nSummary\n\nMicrosoft was made aware of a vulnerability in Windows that allows an attacker with administrator privileges to replace updated Windows system files that have older versions, opening the door for an attacker to reintroduce vulnerabilities to Virtualization-based security (VBS). Rollback of these binaries might allow an attacker to circumvent VBS security features and exfiltrate data that is protected by VBS. This issue is described in CVE-2024-21302 | Windows Secure Kernel Mode Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we will revoke vulnerable VBS system files that are not updated. Because of the large number of VBS-related files that must be blocked, we use an alternative approach to block file versions that are not updated.\n\nScope of Impact\n\nAll Windows devices that support VBS are affected by this issue. This includes on-premises physical devices and virtual machines (VMs). VBS is supported on Windows 10 and later Windows versions, and Windows Server 2016 and later Windows Server versions.\n\nThe VBS state can be checked through the Microsoft System Information tool (Msinfo32.exe). This tool collects information about your device. After starting Msinfo32.exe, scroll down to the Virtualization-based security row. If the value of this row is Running, VBS is enabled and running.\n\nThe VBS state can also be checked with Windows PowerShell by using the Win32_DeviceGuard WMI class. To query the VBS state from PowerShell, open an elevated Windows PowerShell session and then run the following command:\n\nGet-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_DeviceGuard -Namespace root\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeviceGuard\n\nAfter running the above PowerShell command, the VBS state status should be one of the following.\n\nAvailable mitigations\n\nFor all supported versions of Windows 10, version 1507 and later Windows versions, and Windows Server 2016 and later Windows Server versions, administrators can deploy a Microsoft-signed revocation policy (SkuSiPolicy.p7b). This will block vulnerable versions of VBS system files that are not updated from being loaded by the operating system.\n\nWhen this policy is applied to a Windows device, the policy will also be locked to the device by adding a variable to the UEFI firmware. During startup, the policy loads and Windows blocks the loading of binaries that violate the policy. If the UEFI lock is applied and the policy is removed or replaced with an older version, the Windows boot manager will not start, and the device will not start. This boot failure will not show an error and the system will proceed to the next available boot option which might result in a boot loop.\n\nFor the policy mitigation to work, the policy must be updated using the Windows servicing update since the components of Windows and the policy must be from the same release. If the policy mitigation is copied to the device, the device might not start if the wrong version of the mitigation is applied, or the mitigation may not work as expected. Additionally, mitigations described in KB5025885 should be applied to your device.​​​​​​​\n\nUnderstanding mitigation risks\n\nYou need to be aware of potential risks before applying the Microsoft-signed revocation policy. Please review these risks and make any necessary updates to recovery media before applying the mitigation.\n\nUser Mode Code Integrity (UMCI). The Microsoft-signed revocation policy enables user mode code integrity so that rules in the policy are applied to user mode binaries. UMCI also enables Dynamic Code Security by default. Enforcing these features may introduce compatibility issues with applications and scripts and may prevent them from running and have a performance impact on start up time. Before deploying the mitigation, follow the instructions to deploy audit mode policy to test for potential issues.\n\nUEFI Lock and Uninstalling updates. After applying the UEFI lock with the Microsoft-signed revocation policy on a device, the device cannot be reverted (by uninstalling Windows updates, by using a restore point, or by other means) if you continue to apply Secure Boot. Even reformatting the disk will not remove the UEFI lock of the mitigation if it has already been applied. This means that if you attempt to revert the Windows OS to an earlier state that does not have the applied mitigation, the device will not start, no error message will be displayed, and UEFI will proceed to the next available boot option. This might result in a boot loop. You must disable Secure Boot to remove the UEFI lock. Please be aware of all possible implications and test thoroughly before you apply the revocations that are outlined in this article to your device.\n\nExternal Boot Media. After the UEFI lock mitigations have been applied to a device, external boot media must be updated with the latest Windows update installed on the device. If external boot media is not updated to the same Windows update version, the device might not boot from that media. See the instructions in the Updating external boot media section before applying the mitigations.\n\nWindows Recovery Environment. The Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) on the device must be updated with the latest Windows updates installed on the device before the SkuSipolicy.p7b is applied to the device. Omitting this step might prevent WinRE from running the Reset PC feature. For more information, see Add an update package to Windows RE.\n\nPre-boot Execution Environment (PXE) boot. If the mitigation is deployed to a device and you attempt to use PXE boot, the device will not start unless the latest Windows update is also applied to the PXE server boot image. We do not recommend deploying mitigations to network boot sources unless the PXE Boot server has been updated to the latest Windows update released on or after January 2025, including the PXE boot manager.\n\nMitigation deployment guidelines\n\nTo address the issues described in this article, you can deploy a Microsoft-signed revocation policy (SkuSiPolicy.p7b). This mitigation is only supported on Windows 10, version 1507 and later Windows versions, and Windows Server 2016. Before you deploy the Microsoft-signed revocation policy (SkuSiPolicy.p7b), you should test for compatibility issues by using an audit mode policy.\n\nNote If you use BitLocker, make sure that your BitLocker recovery key has been backed up. You can run the following command from an Administrator command prompt and take note of the 48-digit numerical password:\n\nmanage-bde -protectors -get %systemdrive%​​​​​​​\n\nDeploying an audit mode policy\n\nThe Microsoft-signed revocation policy (SkuSiPolicy.p7b) enforces user mode code integrity (UMCI) and Dynamic Code Security. These features may have compatibility issues with customer applications. Before deploying the mitigation, you should deploy an audit policy to detect compatibility issues.\n\nYou have two audit policy options:\n\nUse the provided SiPolicy.p7b audit policy,\n\nOr, compile your own audit policy binary from a provided XML file.\n\nWe recommend using the provided SiPolicy.p7b audit policy binary unless you have already deployed an existing Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policy. The provided audit policy binary will not be UEFI locked. External boot media and recovery media do not need to be updated before applying the audit policy.\n\nWindows Code Integrity will evaluate user and kernel mode binaries against the rules in the audit policy. If code integrity identifies an application or script in violation of the policy, a Windows Event log event will be generated with information about the blocked application or script and information about the enforced policy. These events can be used to determine if there are incompatible applications or scripts being used on your device. For more information, see the Windows Event logs section.\n\nThe SiPolicy.p7b audit policy is included in the latest Windows updates for all supported Windows operating systems. This audit policy should only be applied to devices by installing the latest servicing update and then follow these steps:\n\nRun the following commands from an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt:\n\n# Initialize policy location and destination\n\n$PolicyBinary = $env:windir+\"\\System32\\SecureBootUpdates\\VbsSI_Audit.p7b\"\n\n$DestinationBinary = $env:windir+\"\\System32\\CodeIntegrity\\SiPolicy.p7b\"\n\n# Copy the audit policy binary\n\nCopy-Item -Path $PolicyBinary -Destination $DestinationBinary -force\n\nRestart the device.\n\nConfirm the policy is loaded in the Event Viewer by using the information in the Policy activation events section.\n\nTest by using applications and scripts while the policy is applied to identify compatibility issues.\n\nTo uninstall the SiPolicy.p7b audit policy, follow these steps:\n\nRun the following commands from an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt:\n\n# Initialize policy location\n\n​​​​​​​$PolicyBinary = $env:windir+\"\\System32\\CodeIntegrity\\SiPolicy.p7b\"\n\n# Remove SiPolicy.p7b\n\nRemove-Item -Path $PolicyBinary -force\n\nRestart the device.\n\nConfirm the audit policy is not loaded in the Event Viewer by using the information in the Policy activation events section.\n\nIf you use WDAC to manage applications and drivers allowed to run on your devices, you may already be using a policy named “SiPolicy.p7b”. For all supported Windows operating systems of Windows 10, version 21H2 and later Windows versions, and Windows Server 2022 and later Windows Server versions, you can use the provided XML file to build and deploy an audit policy by using WDAC multiple policy format. For instructions to build and deploy the audit policy binary, see Deploying Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies.\n\nAn XML file with the audit policy rules is available on devices that have the latest Windows update installed. The XML file is located under “%systemroot%\\schemas\\CodeIntegrity\\ExamplePolicies\\VbsSI_Audit.xml”.\n\nDeploying a Microsoft-signed revocation policy (SkuSiPolicy.p7b)\n\nThe Microsoft-signed revocation policy is included as part of the latest Windows update. This policy should only be applied to devices by installing the latest available Windows update released on or after January 2025 and then follow these steps:\n\nNote If updates are missing, the device may not start with the mitigation applied or the mitigation may not work as expected. Make sure to update your bootable Windows media with the latest available Windows update before deploying the policy. For details on how to update bootable media, see the Updating external boot media section.\n\nRun the following commands in an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt:\n\n$PolicyBinary = $env:windir+\"\\System32\\SecureBootUpdates\\SkuSiPolicy.p7b\"\n\n$MountPoint = 's:'\n\n$EFIDestinationFolder = \"$MountPoint\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\"\n\nmountvol $MountPoint /S\n\nif (-Not (Test-Path $EFIDestinationFolder)) { New-Item -Path $EFIDestinationFolder -Type Directory -Force }\n\nCopy-Item -Path $PolicyBinary -Destination $EFIDestinationFolder -Force\n\nmountvol $MountPoint /D\n\nRestart your device.\n\nConfirm the policy is loaded in the Event Viewer by using the information in the Windows Event logs section.\n\nNotes\n\nYou should not remove the SkuSiPolicy.p7b revocation (policy) file after it is deployed. Your device might no longer be able to start if the file is removed.\n\nIf your device does not start, see the Recovery procedure section.\n\nUpdating external boot media\n\nTo use external boot media with a device that has a Microsoft-signed revocation policy applied, the external boot media must be updated with the latest Windows update including the Boot manager. If the media does not include the latest Windows update, the media will not start.\n\nImportant We recommend that you Create a recovery drive before proceeding. This media can be used to reinstall a device in case there is a major issue.\n\nUse the following steps to update the external boot media:\n\nGo to a device where the latest Windows updates have been installed.\n\nMount the external boot media as a drive letter. For example, mount a thumb drive as D:.\n\nClick Start, type Create a Recovery Drive in the Search box, and then click Create a recovery drive control panel. Follow the instructions to create a recovery drive by using the mounted thumb drive.\n\nSafely remove the mounted thumb drive.\n\nIf you manage installable media in your environment by using the Update Windows installation media with Dynamic Update guidance, follow these steps:\n\nGo to a device where the latest Windows updates have been installed.\n\nFollow the steps in Update Windows installation media with Dynamic Update to create media that has the latest Windows updates installed.\n\nWindows Event logs\n\nWindows logs events when code integrity policies, including SkuSiPolicy.p7b, are loaded and when a file is blocked from loading because of policy enforcement. You can use these events to verify that the mitigation has been applied.\n\nCode integrity logs are available in the Windows Event Viewer under Application and Services logs > Microsoft > Windows > CodeIntegrity > Operational > Application and Services logs > Services logs > Microsoft > Windows > AppLocker > MSI and Script.\n\nFor more information on code integrity events, see the Windows Defender Application Control operational guide.\n\nPolicy activation events\n\nPolicy activation events are available in the Windows Event Viewer under Application and Services logs > Microsoft > Windows > CodeIntegrity > Operational.\n\nCodeIntegrity Event 3099 in the \"CodeIntegrity - Operational\" event log indicates that a policy has been loaded and includes details about the loaded policy. Information in the event includes the friendly name of the policy, a globally unique identifier (GUID), and a hash of the policy. Multiple CodeIntegrity Event 3099 events will be present if there are multiple code integrity policies applied to the device.\n\nWhen the provided audit policy is applied, there will be an event with the following information:\n\nPolicyNameBuffer – Microsoft Windows Virtualization Based Security Audit Policy\n\nPolicyGUID – {a244370e-44c9-4c06-b551-f6016e563076}\n\nPolicyHash – 98FC5872FD022C7DB400953053756A6E62A8F24E7BD8FE080C6525DFBCA38387\n\nWhen the Microsoft-signed revocation policy (SkuSiPolicy.p7b) is applied, there will be an event with the following information (See screenshot of CodeIntegrity event 3099 below):\n\nPolicyNameBuffer – Microsoft Windows SKU SI Policy\n\nPolicyGUID – {976d12c8-cb9f-4730-be52-54600843238e}\n\nPolicyHash – 107E8FDD187C34CF8B8EA46A4EE99F0DB60F491650DC989DB71B4825DC73169D\n\nIf you have applied the audit policy or the mitigation to your device and CodeIntegrity Event 3099 for the applied policy is not present, the policy is not being enforced. Please consult the deployment instructions to verify the policy was installed correctly.\n\nNote The Code Integrity event 3099 is not supported on versions of Windows 10 Enterprise 2016, Windows Server 2016, and Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB. To verify that the policy has been applied (audit or revocation policy), you must mount the EFI System Partition using the mountvol.exe command and look to see that the policy has been applied to the EFI partition. Be sure to unmount the EFI System Partition after verification.\n\nSkuSiPolicy.p7b - Revocation Policy\n\nSiPolicy.p7b - Audit Policy\n\n​​​​​​​\n\nAudit and block events\n\nCode integrity audit and block events are available in the Windows Event Viewer under Application and Services logs > Microsoft > Windows > CodeIntegrity > Operational > Application and Services logs > Microsoft > Windows > AppLocker > MSI and Script.\n\nThe former logging location includes events about the control of executables, dlls, and drivers. The latter logging location includes events about the control of MSI installers, scripts, and COM objects.\n\nCodeIntegrity Event 3076 in the \"CodeIntegrity – Operational\" log is the main block event for audit mode policies and indicates that a file would have been blocked if a policy was enforced. This event includes information about the blocked file and about the enforced policy. For files that would be blocked by the mitigation, the policy information in Event 3077 will match the policy information of audit policy from Event 3099.\n\nCodeIntegrity Event 3077 in the \"CodeIntegrity – Operational\" log indicates that an executable, .dll, or driver has been blocked from loading. This event includes information about the blocked file and about the enforced policy. For files blocked by the mitigation, the policy information in CodeIntegrity Event 3077 will match the policy information of SkuSiPolicy.p7b from CodeIntegrity Event 3099. CodeIntegrity Event 3077 will not be present if there are not any executable, .dll, or drivers in violation of code integrity policy on your device.\n\nFor other code integrity audit and block events, see Understanding Application Control events.\n\nPolicy Removal and Recovery Procedure\n\nIf something goes wrong after applying the mitigation, you can use the following steps to remove the mitigation:\n\nSuspend BitLocker if it is enabled. Run the following command from an elevated Command Prompt window:\n\nManager-bde -protectors -disable c: -rebootcount 3\n\nTurn off Secure Boot from the UEFI BIOS menu.\n\nThe procedure for turning off Secure Boot differs between device manufacturers and models. For help locating where to turn off Secure Boot, consult with documentation from your device manufacturer. More details can be found in Disabling Secure Boot.\n\nRemove the SkuSiPolicy.p7b policy.\n\nStart Windows normally and then sign in.\n\nThe SkuSiPolicy.p7b policy must be removed from the following location:\n\n​​​​​​​<EFI System Partition>\\Microsoft\\Boot\\SkuSiPolicy.p7b​​​​​​​\n\nRun the following commands from an elevated Windows PowerShell session to clean up policy from those locations:\n\n$PolicyBinary = $env:windir+\"\\System32\\SecureBootUpdates\\SkuSiPolicy.p7b\"\n\n$MountPoint = 's:'\n\n$EFIPolicyPath = \"$MountPoint\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\SkuSiPolicy.p7b\"\n\n$EFIDestinationFolder=\"$MountPoint\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\"\n\nmountvol $MountPoint /S\n\nif (-Not (Test-Path $EFIDestinationFolder)) { New-Item -Path $EFIDestinationFolder -Type Directory -Force }\n\nif (Test-Path $EFIPolicyPath ) {Remove-Item -Path $EFIPolicyPath -Force }\n\n​​​​​​​mountvol $MountPoint /D\n\nTurn on Secure Boot from BIOS.\n\nConsult with the documentation from your device manufacturer for locating where to turn on Secure Boot.\n\nIf you turned off Secure Boot in Step 1 and your drive is protected by BitLocker, suspend BitLocker protection and then turn on Secure Boot from your UEFI BIOS menu.\n\nTurn on BitLocker. Run the following command from an elevated Command Prompt window:\n\nManager-bde -protectors -enable c:\n\nRestart your device.",

      "# [Device Guard Signing Service migration to Trusted Signing on 2024-09-11](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/trusted-signing/how-to-device-guard-signing-service-migration)\nDevice Guard Signing Service (DGSSv2) migration to Trusted Signing for code integrity policy\n\nDevice Guard Signing Service is being deprecated at the beginning of December 2024. All existing DGSSv2 customers who plan to continue using the service must transition to Trusted Signing. The root that issues the code signing and CI policy signing certificates remains the same between DGSSv2 and Trusted Signing. Since Trusted Signing is an Azure service, you now need to have Azure Tenant ID and Subscription ID to access signing, and a new dedicated EKU for signing. Steps you need to take include:\n\nGet an Azure account\n\nSet up access to signing control (controlled through Azure portal and Azure identities)\n\nChoose a pricing tier (Trusted Signing is a paid service – learn more about pricing here)\n\nFollow the steps dependent on your migration scenarios\n\nThis guide outlines the steps needed to migrate to Trusted Signing. Read the entirety of this document and note these steps must be followed carefully; missing a step may cause damage to the OS image.\n\nMigration scenarios\n\nScenario 1: Signed CI Policy Migration & Deployment\n\nYou have an existing CI policy signed with DGSSv2 and now wish to migrate it to Trusted Signing.\n\nScenario 2: Unsigned to Signed CI Policy Migration & Deployment\n\nYou have an existing unsigned CI policy and now wish to migrate it to Trusted Signing with a signed CI policy.\n\nScenario 3: Unsigned to Unsigned CI Policy Migration & Deployment\n\nYou have an existing unsigned CI policy and now wish to migrate it to Trusted Signing, maintaining it as an unsigned CI policy.\n\nScenario 4: No Existing CI Policy\n\nYou currently don't have a CI policy deployed in your environment and want to migrate to Trusted Signing.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nWe strongly encourage creating a restoration image(s) before proceeding with the migration steps.\n\nIf you had previously deployed a CI policy in your environment (scenarios #1 and #2 above), you must have access to the existing policy xml file.\n\nWe strongly encourage you to do the steps below on one machine before attempting to deploy to your broader environment.\n\nScenario 1: Signed CI Policy Migration and Deployment\n\nThe migration of the signed CI policy is applicable only to customers who have already implemented a DGSSv2 signed CI policy in their environment. To ensure a smooth transition and deployment, carefully follow the next two steps:\n\nStep 1: Remove the deployed signed CI policy from a single machine\n\nNote\n\nBy following the actions of step 1, your machine isn't protected by CI until you have deployed a new one. The deployment of a new policy is covered by step 2\n\nConfirm with your system administrator to verify you have a DGSSv2 signed policy deployed, or use below manual way:\n\nGo to C:\\Windows\\System32\\CodeIntegrity, if there's a SiPolicy.p7b file, which indicates you have a CI policy deployed.\n\nOpen the file. If it shows a certificate, it means the CI policy is signed.\n\nIf you see the error “This file is invalid for use as the following: PKCS #7”, the CI policy is unsigned.\n\nUnder the Rules section of the current CI Policy XML file, add the following rule:\n\n<Rule> <Option>Enabled:Unsigned System Integrity Policy</Option> </Rule>\n\nConvert the policy xml to .bin file using this PowerShell: ConvertFrom-CIPolicy\n\nSample:\n\nConvertFrom-CIPolicy -XmlFilePath <xmlCIPolicyFilePath> -BinaryFilePath <binaryCIPolicyFilePath>\n\nSign the generated policy .bin file with Trusted Signing using the following instructions: Sign a CI policy.\n\nDeploy this signed policy .bin file. For more information, refer to Deploy Windows Defender Application Control polices.\n\nReboot the machine and confirm the Code Integrity event 3099 shows that the policy is activated.\n\nOpen Event Viewer (Select Start, type Event Viewer) → Applications and Services Logs → Microsoft → Windows → CodeIntegrity → Operational\n\nFilter by event ID 3099\n\nRun the command to delete this CI policy: del SiPolicy.p7b from both folders: C:\\Windows\\System32\\CodeIntegrity and S:\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot.\n\nIf there's no S: drive, run the command: mountvol.exe s: /s.\n\nIf your machine already has an S: drive, mount the EFI partition to a different letter, such as X.\n\nIf there's no EFI partition in the machine, ignore the EFI deletion step (if there's no /s option for the command mountvol.exe).\n\nReboot the machine once deletion is completed.\n\nReboot the machine twice more, to ensure the CI policy is properly removed, before moving on or deploying this change to other machines.\n\nStep 2: Deploy and test the new CI policy on the same machine\n\nContinue to the steps outlined in Scenario 2.\n\nScenario 2: Unsigned to Signed CI Policy Migration and Deployment\n\nStep 1: Determine your new EKUs\n\nSince Trusted Signing is a new service it has different EKUs than DGSSv2. Therefore, you need to get the new EKUs added to your policy. You need to get your EKU from the Trusted Signing account to add to your CI policy’s EKU section. The two ways to do so are:\n\nUsing the steps in Sign a CI policy run the command Get-AzCodeSigningCustomerEkuto get the customer EKU.\n\nWithin your Trusted Signing account, select “Certificate Profiles”, then select your Private Trust certificate profile. You'll see information on the profile like the screenshot below. The ‘Enhanced key usage’ listed is your customer EKU.\n\nNow that you have the customer EKU. You'll need to generate a function EKU. To do so pass the customer EKU into the code below. The output is your function EKU.\n\nprivate string CalculateEkuValue(string CustomerEku) { var ekuOid = CryptoConfig.EncodeOID(CustomerEku); var ekuBit = BitConverter.ToString(ekuOid).Replace(\"-\", \"\"); var ekuArray = ekuBit.ToCharArray(); ekuArray[1] = '1'; return new string(ekuArray); }\n\nStep 2: Deploy and test the new CI policy\n\nNow that you have your two EKUs, it is time to edit your CI policy. If you have an existing CI policy, you can proceed to the next section. To create a new one go to: Policy creation for common WDAC usage scenarios - Windows Security.\n\nAdd the new EKU in the EKU section of your policy, using the two EKU values from Step 1.\n\n<EKU ID=\"ID_EKU_ACS\" FriendlyName=\"ACS EKU -Customer EKU\" Value=\"function EKU\"/>\n\nVerify these signers are present/added in the CI policy:\n\n<Signer ID=\"ID_SIGNER_ACS_CODE\" Name=\"Your Account Name Code Signing Certificate\"> <CertRoot Value=\"28D3FAEF436A9D7644F01BEFFBF9E143AE6FB7A00B125F86CC9594A078980904B0597DF0F6BDD15E65E80F4D74E6D606\" Type=\"TBS\"/> <CertEKU ID=\"ID_EKU_ACS\"/> </Signer> <Signer ID=\"ID_SIGNER_ACS_POLICY\" Name=\"Your Account Name CI Policy Signing Certificate\"> <CertRoot Type=\"TBS\" Value=\"FC9C3E96720126881A6CEA067B5EA11ED0ABFC77835F720EDCFF4660C9A59669\"/> <CertEKU ID=\"ID_EKU_ACS\"/> </Signer>\n\nYour Account Name Code Signing Certificate is your Trusted Signing account name. Note that this field isn't verified in the CI policy, but we recommend you putting your Trusted signing account name in the field. To find your account name on the Azure portal navigate to Azure portal, search “Trusted Signing” in the top search bar and select your account that comes up in the search results. The screenshot below shows the account name outlined in red.\n\nConvert the .xml to .bin policy file using the following command: ConvertFrom-CIPolicy\n\nSample:\n\nConvertFrom-CIPolicy -XmlFilePath <xmlCIPolicyFilePath> -BinaryFilePath <binaryCIPolicyFilePath>\n\nIf you would like to sign this policy, following these instructions Sign a CI policyto sign the policy using Trusted Signing.\n\nDeploy this signed policy .bin file; refer to this link for instructions.\n\nReboot the machine and confirm that Code Integrity event 3099 is showing, which means the new CI policy is activated.\n\nVerify that any files signed with Trusted Signing still behave as expected.\n\nSign a catalog file with Trusted Signing and make sure it can run on your test machine with the Trusted Signing (new) CI policy.\n\nTo sign catalog files with Trusted Signing, refer to the steps in:\n\nQuickstart: Set up Trusted Signing to set up a Private Trust certificate profile.\n\nSet up signing integrations to use Trusted Signing to sign the files using Private Trust in the Trusted Signing service.\n\nTo sign MSIX packages with Trusted Signing, refer to instructions on how to sign MSIX packages with MSIX Packaging Tool or SignTool - directly through Trusted Signing.\n\nTo sign with Trusted Signing in the MSIX Packaging Tool you need to join the MSIX Insiders program.\n\nAfter confirming the CI policy is activated on this machine and all scenarios work as expected, repeat steps on the rest of the desired machines in your environment.\n\nScenario 3: Unsigned to Unsigned CI Policy Migration and Deployment\n\nYou need to add the Trusted Signing EKUs to your existing CI policy by following the steps in Scenario 2 to locate and update the EKUs.\n\nScenario 4: No existing CI policy\n\nIf isolation is desired, deploy a new CI policy by following steps outlined in Scenario 2.",

table shows the mapping of information to the AppLocker publisher rule field.\n\nDevice portal data AppLocker publisher rule field PackageFullName ProductName: The product name is first part of the PackageFullName followed by the version number. In the Windows Camera example, the ProductName is Microsoft.WindowsCamera. Publisher Publisher Version Version\n\nThe version can be used either in the HighSection or LowSection of the BinaryVersionRange.\n\nHighSection defines the highest version number and LowSection defines the lowest version number that should be trusted. You can use a wildcard for both versions to make a version- independent rule. Using a wildcard for one of the values will provide higher than or lower than a specific version semantics.\n\nHere's an example AppLocker publisher rule:\n\n<FilePublisherCondition PublisherName=\"CN=Microsoft Corporation, O=Microsoft Corporation, L=Redmond, S=Washington, C=US\" ProductName=\"Microsoft.Reader\" BinaryName=\"*\"> <BinaryVersionRange LowSection=\"*\" HighSection=\"*\" /> </FilePublisherCondition>\n\nYou can get the publisher name and product name of apps using either Get-AppxPackage PowerShell cmdlet or Windows Device Portal.\n\nSettings apps that rely on splash apps\n\nThese apps are blocked unless they're explicitly added to the list of allowed apps. The following table shows the subset of Settings apps that rely on splash apps.\n\nThe product name is first part of the PackageFullName followed by the version number.\n\nSettings app name PackageFullName or Product name ProductID Work or school account Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin e5f8b2c4-75ae-45ee-9be8-212e34f77747 Email and accounts Microsoft.AccountsControl 39cf127b-8c67-c149-539a-c02271d07060 SettingsPageKeyboard 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea5608_1.1.0.0_neutral__cw8ffb7c56vgc 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea5608 SettingsPageTimeRegion 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea560c_1.0.0.0_neutral__gqhq4qhgje4fw 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea560c SettingsPagePCSystemBluetooth 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea5620_1.0.0.0_neutral__nvaj48k0z8te8 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea5620 SettingsPageNetworkAirplaneMode 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea5621_1.0.0.0_neutral__f73kmnfsk0aj2 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea5621 SettingsPageNetworkWiFi 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea5623_1.0.0.0_neutral__a3jhh70a240gm 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea5623 SettingsPageNetworkInternetSharing 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea5629_1.0.0.0_neutral__yqcw9dmx6t3pe 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea5629 SettingsPageAccountsWorkplace 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea562a_1.0.0.0_neutral__q1wjbr14bc3d0 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea562a SettingsPageRestoreUpdate 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea5640_1.0.0.0_neutral__j77gbj5kz730y 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea5640 SettingsPageKidsCorner 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea5802_1.0.0.0_neutral__1wmss2z3sft8c 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea5802 SettingsPageDrivingMode 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea5804_1.0.0.0_neutral__t553967svy34g 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea5804 SettingsPageTimeLanguage 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea5808_1.0.0.0_neutral__ecxasj38g8ynw 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea5808 SettingsPageAppsCorner 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea580a_1.0.0.0_neutral__4vefaa8deck74 5b04b775-356b-4aa0-aaf8-6491ffea580a SettingsPagePhoneNfc b0894dfd-4671-4bb9-bc17-a8b39947ffb6_1.0.0.0_neutral__1prqnbg33c1tj b0894dfd-4671-4bb9-bc17-a8b39947ffb6\n\nInbox apps and components\n\nThe following list shows the apps that may be included in the inbox.\n\nNote\n\nThis list identifies system apps that ship as part of Windows that you can add to your AppLocker policy to ensure proper functioning of the operating system. If you decide to block some of these apps, we recommend a thorough testing before deploying to your production environment. Failure to do so may result in unexpected failures and can significantly degrade the user experience.\n\nApp Product ID Product name 3D Viewer f41647c9-d567-4378-b2ab-7924e5a152f3

As its full name implies, Mshta can execute <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc738350(v=ws.10)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Windows Script Host code</a> (<a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/lwef/using-vbscript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VBScript</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/lwef/using-javascript-and-jscript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JScript</a>) embedded within HTML in a network proxy-aware fashion. These capabilities make Mshta an appealing vehicle for adversaries to proxy execution of arbitrary script code through a trusted, signed utility, making it a reliable technique during both initial and later stages of an infection.</p><p>Mshta also grants adversaries the flexibility to embed a script payload within any legitimate file format. For example, it is common for adversaries to embed HTA content within legitimate Microsoft binaries (e.g., an <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7d6ee310f1cd4512d140c94a95f0db4e76a7171c6a65f5c483e7f8a08f7efe78/details\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">embedded HTA payload contained within <code>dialer.exe</code></a>). They simply append malicious HTA content to the end of the file and <code>mshta.exe</code> scans through the file until it finds valid HTA script content. Adversaries know that a payload is less likely to be initially caught if it is embedded within an otherwise legitimate file.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></section><section class=\"tdr-nav-sticky\"><div class=\"tdr-nav-sticky-container\"><ul class=\"tdr-anchor-list\"><li class=\"tdr-subnavigation-item\"> <a href=\"#analysis\">Analysis</a></li><li class=\"tdr-subnavigation-item\"> <a href=\"#take-action\">Take action</a></li><li class=\"tdr-subnavigation-item\"> <a href=\"#visibility\">Visibility</a></li><li class=\"tdr-subnavigation-item\"> <a href=\"#detection\">Detection </a></li><li class=\"tdr-subnavigation-item\"> <a href=\"#testing\">Testing</a></li></ul></div></section> <script>document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function() { const videos = document.querySelectorAll(\".videoIcon\");

      "# [The Power and Peril of RMM Tools by The Hacker News, www.facebook.com on 2024-07-30](https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/the-power-and-peril-of-rmm-tools.html)\nAs more people work remotely, IT departments must manage devices distributed over different cities and countries relying on VPNs and remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools for system administration.\n\nHowever, like any new technology, RMM tools can also be used maliciously. Threat actors can establish connections to a victim's device and run commands, exfiltrate data, and stay undetected.\n\nThis article will cover real-world examples of RMM exploits and show you how to protect your organization from these attacks.\n\nWhat are RMM tools?\n\nRMM software simplifies network management, allowing IT professionals to remotely solve problems, install software, and upload or download files to or from devices.\n\nUnfortunately, this connection is not always secure, and attackers can use malicious software to connect their servers to a victim's device. As these connections become easier to detect, however, ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups have had to adjust their methods.\n\nIn most of the cyber incidents Varonis investigated last year, RaaS gangs employed a technique known as Living off the Land, using legitimate IT tools to gain remote control, navigate networks undetected, and steal data.\n\nRMM tools enable attackers to blend in and evade detection. They and their traffic are typically \"ignored\" by security controls and organizational security policies, such as application whitelisting.\n\nThis tactic also helps script kiddies — once connected, they will find everything they need already installed and ready for them.\n\nOur research identified two main methods attackers use to manipulate RMM tools:\n\nAbusing existing RMM tools: Attackers gain initial access to an organization's network using preexisting RMM tools. They exploit weak or default credentials or tool vulnerabilities to gain access without triggering detection.\n\nInstalling new RMM tools: Attackers install their preferred RMM tools by first gaining access to the network. They use phishing emails or social engineering techniques to trick victims into unwittingly installing the RMM tool on their network.\n\nBelow are common RMM tools and RaaS gangs:\n\nCommon RMM tools and RaaS gangs\n\nReal-world examples of RMM exploits\n\nDuring a recent investigation, our Managed Data Detection and Response (MDDR) team analyzed an organization's data and found, in the PowerShell history of a compromised device, evidence of an RMM tool named \"KiTTY.\"\n\nThis software was a modified version of PuTTY, a well-known tool for creating telnet and SSH sessions with remote machines. Because PuTTY is a legitimate RMM tool, none of the organization's security software raised any red flags, so KiTTY was able to create reverse tunnels over port 443 to expose internal servers to an AWS EC2 box.\n\nThe Varonis team conducted a comprehensive analysis. They found that the sessions to the AWS EC2 box using KiTTY were key to revealing what happened, how it was done, and — most importantly — what files were stolen.\n\nThis crucial evidence was a turning point in the investigation and helped trace the entire attack chain. It also revealed the organization's security gaps, how to address them, and the potential consequences of this attack.\n\nStrategies to defend RMM tools\n\nConsider implementing the following strategies to reduce the chance of attackers abusing RMM tools.\n\nAn application control policy\n\nRestrict your organization from using multiple RMM tools by enforcing an application control policy:\n\nEnsure RMM tools are updated, patched, and accessible only to authorized users with MFA enabled\n\nProactively block both inbound and outbound connections on forbidden RMM ports and protocols at the network perimeter\n\nOne option is to create a Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policy using PowerShell that whitelists applications based on their publisher. It's important to note that creating WDAC policies requires administrative privileges, and deploying them via Group Policy requires domain administrative privileges.\n\nAs a precaution, you should test the policy in audit mode before deploying it in enforce mode to avoid inadvertently blocking necessary applications.\n\nOpen PowerShell with administrative privileges\n\nCreate a new policy: You can create a new policy using the New-CIPolicy cmdlet. This cmdlet takes a path to a directory or a file, scans it, and makes a policy that allows all files in that path, such as executables and DLL files, to run on your network.\n\nFor example, if you want to allow everything signed by the publisher of a specific application, you can follow the example below:\n\nNew-CIPolicy -FilePath \"C:\\Path\\To\\Application.exe\" -Level Publisher -UserPEs -Fallback Hash -Enable -OutputFilePath \"C:\\Path\\To\\Policy.xml\"\n\nIn this command, -FilePath specifies the path to the application, -Level Publisher means that the policy will allow everything signed by the same publisher as the application, and -UserPEs means that the policy will include user-mode executables.\n\n-Fallback Hash means that if the file is not signed, the policy will allow it based on its hash,-Enable means that the policy will be enabled, and -OutputFilePath specifies the path where the policy will be saved.\n\nConvert the policy to a binary format: WDAC policies must be deployed in a binary format. You can convert the policy using the ConvertFrom-CIPolicy cmdlet: ConvertFrom-CIPolicy -XmlFilePath \"C:\\Path\\To\\Policy.xml\" -BinaryFilePath \"C:\\Path\\To\\Policy.bin\"\n\nDeploy the policy: You can deploy the policy using the group policy management console (GPMC). To do this, you must copy the .bin file to the \\\\Windows\\System32\\CodeIntegrity directory on each computer where you want to deploy the policy. Then, you need to set the Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → System Device Guard → Deploy Windows Defender Application Control policy setting to Enabled and set the Use Windows Defender Application Control to help protect your device option to Enforce.\n\nContinuous monitoring\n\nMonitor your network traffic and logs, especially regarding RMM tools. Consider implementing services like Varonis MDDR, which provides 24x7x365 network monitoring and behavioral analysis.\n\nUser training and awareness\n\nTrain your employees to identify phishing attempts and manage passwords effectively, as manipulating users is a common way attackers gain access to your network. Encourage the reporting of suspicious activity and regularly test your cybersecurity team to identify potential risks.\n\nReduce your risk without taking any.\n\nAs technology advances, it gives an edge to both defenders and attackers, and RMM tools are just one example of the potential threats orgs face.\n\nAt Varonis, our mission is to protect what matters most: your data. Our all-in-one Data Security Platform continuously discovers and classifies critical data, removes exposures, and stops threats in real time with AI-powered automation.\n\nCurious to see what risks might be prevalent in your environment?

      "# [Exploiting WDAC: How Attackers Bypass EDR Sensors and What to Do on 2024-12-26](https://windowsforum.com/threads/exploiting-wdac-how-attackers-bypass-edr-sensors-and-what-to-do.348590/)\nIn the ever-evolving chess game of cybersecurity versus threat actors, a new, insidious tactic has emerged. This latest exploit weaponizes Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) to effectively bypass Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) sensors, leaving organizations vulnerable to highly dangerous and stealthy attacks. Let’s unpack how this attack works and, more importantly, what you can do to mitigate it.\n\nWhat Exactly is Happening?​\n\nAmong the arsenal of tools that IT administrators can employ, Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) plays a vital role. Introduced with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016, WDAC is a feature designed to offer granular administrative control over what code can or cannot execute within a Windows environment. Think of it as the gatekeeper that ensures only trusted applications get to play within your digital ecosystem.\n\nHowever, bad actors have turned this gatekeeper into an accomplice through a sophisticated and chillingly smart exploit. Leveraging WDAC’s legitimate features, these attackers are using custom WDAC policies to disable EDR processes—those essential watchdogs designed to detect malicious activity on your systems.\n\nThe method, categorized under the MITRE ATT&CK framework as part of the \"Impair Defenses\" tactic (Technique ID: T1562), is particularly pernicious because it uses administrative privileges to rewrite the rulebook. By crafting rogue WDAC policies, attackers can systematically block EDR software from running at startup. Picture a fortress where the intruders not only snuck in but also dismantled the alarm system and locked it in silence—the house is wide open.\n\nHow Does the Attack Work? A Step-by-Step Breakdown​\n\nThe attack unfolds across three distinct phases, each employing legitimate functionality in a subversive way:\n\n1. Policy Creation and Placement​\n\nThe attacker creates a specially tailored WDAC policy file. This file includes permissions to execute their own tools while actively blocking critical security software, including the all-essential EDR sensors. They plant this malicious policy in the C:\\Windows\\System32\\CodeIntegrity directory on the target system. This is where WDAC policies reside and take effect.\n\n2. System Reboot​\n\nHere’s the kicker—WDAC policies are only enforced after a reboot. Once the attacker plants their wicked little policy, all they need is a simple system restart. After booting back up, the malicious WDAC policy takes center stage and controls what processes are allowed to run (or not run).\n\n3. EDR Shutdown​\n\nWhen the system boots back up, the malicious policy prevents EDR tools from loading. This effectively blinds the system, giving attackers free rein to run undetected. What’s worse? Tools like this do not create the immediate and noisy chaos that ransomware attacks typically do—making the whole operation dangerously silent.\n\nA New Tool for Sleepless Administrators: The Krueger Proof-of-Concept​\n\nIn an unsettling development, a legitimate proof-of-concept (PoC) tool known as Krueger has surfaced. Created by security researcher Logan Goins, Krueger is a double-edged sword. While on one hand such tools often serve to demonstrate vulnerabilities and help improve defenses, in the wrong hands, they become optimized weapons for exploitation.\n\nKrueger operates directly in system memory as part of post-exploitation activities, enabling attackers to deploy it covertly without leaving much of a trail. Essentially, once attackers gain administrative access to a machine, Krueger amplifies their ability to render EDR ineffective.\n\nWhy is This a Big Deal?​\n\nThe impact of this attack vector isn’t confined to individual machines. If an attacker secures domain admin privileges, they can propagate this exploit across an entire organization's IT infrastructure—outmatching endpoint defenses at scale. Hypothetically, in environments with hundreds or thousands of devices, this could completely nerf an organization’s cybersecurity defenses in one fell swoop.\n\nMitigation Strategies: Fight Back​\n\nAs alarming as this attack is, solutions do exist. Here’s how your organization can fortify itself against this threat:\n\n1. Enforce WDAC Policies Centrally​\n\nUse Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to deploy network-wide WDAC policies that override any local, rogue tampering.\n\nBy centralizing control, you block attackers from distributing unauthorized policies to individual endpoints.\n\n2. Principle of Least Privilege​\n\nRestrict administrative privileges across your network. Limit which users or accounts have access to modify WDAC policies or access sensitive system folders like C:\\Windows\\System32\\CodeIntegrity.\n\n3. Harden Administrative Controls​\n\nLock Down Local Admin Accounts: Tools like Microsoft’s Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) can help manage local administrator account credentials securely and limit exposure.\n\nRestrict access to sensitive directories and SMB shares, leaving fewer avenues for attackers to inject malicious policies.\n\n4. Regular Audits and Monitoring​\n\nConduct regular audits of running WDAC policies across your fleet of endpoints. Uncover any unexpected or unauthorized modifications immediately.\n\nLeverage SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems to identify anomalies, such as sudden policy file modifications or unexplained system reboots.\n\nThe Bigger Picture​\n\nThis latest attack serves as yet another reminder of the cat-and-mouse game between defenders and cybercriminals. What makes it particularly unsettling is how it repurposes a tool built to enhance security into one that undermines it.\n\nBut this underscores the necessity of a layered defense strategy. Relying solely on endpoint security tools like EDR is no longer sufficient in today’s cyber landscape. Organizations must adopt a holistic approach, combining rigorous system monitoring, administrative best practices, and user education to stay one step ahead of the attackers.\n\nFinal Thoughts​\n\nAs Mark Johnson, CISO of a Fortune 500 company, aptly put it: “Organizations need to be aware of this threat and take proactive measures. Implementing strong access controls and regularly auditing WDAC policies are now more crucial than ever.”\n\nThe key takeaway? Cybersecurity is not a one-time setup—it's a continuous process of assessment, adaptation, and improvement. Whether you’re a seasoned IT admin or a small business owner learning the ropes, vigilance and proactivity are your most potent weapons. After all, every gatekeeper needs someone watching their back.\n\nGot questions or thoughts about this article? Join the discussion on WindowsForum.com!

      "# [Local DNS Hijack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/796522/local-dns-hijack/)\nGreetings folks,\n\nHoping for some assistance on an issue facing one of my clients that has me stumped.\n\n2 people at a company have reported occasionally having web searches redirect to strange addresses. It's been happening for 2-3 weeks. I've checked, and it looks like there is a secondary DNS server added that's likely malicious. This was seen on both.\n\nOther than that, no other behavior is reported. The installed EDR has been silent, and a MBAM full scan on the first user's computer has come up clean.\n\nDNS should be coming from the firewall which afiak is fine and secure, nothing strange. I'm hoping someone can check the attached frst logs and advise if there is any evidence of local infection that I've missed.\n\nThanks!\n\n(I've censored the logs a touch, if a fixlist is provided I'll edit the user and company name back in, if required.)\n\nScan result of Farbar Recovery Scan Tool (FRST) (x64) Version: 10.04.2024\n\nRan by admin (administrator) on ADL-PF4EQNV1 (LENOVO 21JR001RUS) (15-04-2024 10:04:33)\n\nRunning from C:\\Temp\\farbar\\FRST64.exe\n\nLoaded Profiles: admin & USERNAME\n\nPlatform: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro Version 23H2 22631.3447 (X64) Language: English (United States)\n\nDefault browser: Edge\n\nBoot Mode: Normal\n\n==================== Processes (Whitelisted) =================\n\n(If an entry is included in the fixlist, the process will be closed.

      "# [CTO at NCSC Summary: week ending October 13th by Ollie Whitehouse on 2024-10-12](https://ctoatncsc.substack.com/p/cto-at-ncsc-summary-week-ending-october-3e9)\nWelcome to the weekly highlights and analysis of the blueteamsec subreddit (and my wider reading). Not everything makes it in, but the best bits do.\n\nOperationally this week nothing overly of note other that edge devices being exploited once more..\n\nIn the high-level this week:\n\nRussian foreign intelligence poses global threat with cyber campaign exploiting established vulnerabilities - NCSC UK and US partners warn:\n\n“UK and US cyber agencies highlight ongoing exploitation of vulnerabilities at scale by Russian cyber actors.\n\nOrganisations encouraged to rapidly deploy patches and prioritise software updates to prevent systems being accessed by online actors linked to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service.”\n\nNot all types of MFA are created equal... - NCSC UK blogs about new guidance - “Our updated multi-factor authentication (MFA) guidance recommends organisations use techniques that give better protection against phishing attacks.”\n\nCyber security tips for barristers, solicitors and legal professionals - NCSC UK provides advice - “The following steps are aimed at sole practitioners and also small/medium-sized legal firms, to help them to reduce the likelihood of becoming victims of a cyber attack. Larger sized organisations should consult with their in-house IT/support teams.”\n\nFunded Cyber Essentials Programme - NCSC UK - “a free Cyber Essentials programme to small organisations working in AI, Quantum, engineering or synthetic biology and semiconductors. “\n\nRepresent the UK Cyber Team - SANS announces - “Are you an 18–25-year-old cyber security enthusiast ready to put your skills to the test?.. The UK Cyber Team Competition consists of three Capture the Flag (CTF) rounds, with the final event taking place in January 2025. The selected UK Cyber Team will represent the UK on the international Capture The Flag stage.”\n\nIntroduction of landmark Cyber Security Legislation Package - Australian Home Affairs announces - “The Cyber Security Legislative Package will implement seven initiatives under the 2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy, addressing legislative gaps to bring Australia in line with international best practice and take the next step to ensure Australia is on track to become a global leader in cyber security. These measures will address gaps in current legislation to:\n\nmandate minimum cyber security standards for smart devices;\n\nintroduce mandatory ransomware reporting for certain businesses to report ransom payments;\n\nintroduce a ‘limited use’ obligation for the National Cyber Security Coordinator and the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD); and\n\nestablish a Cyber Incident Review Board.”\n\nCyber resilience act: Council adopts new law on security requirements for digital products - European Council announces - “The Council adopted today a new law on cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements with a view to ensuring that products, such as connected home cameras, fridges, TVs, and toys, are safe before they are placed on the market (cyber resilience act). The new regulation aims to fill the gaps, clarify the links, and make the existing cybersecurity legislative framework more coherent, ensuring that products with digital components, for example ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) products, are made secure throughout the supply chain and throughout their lifecycle.”\n\nNCSC NZ launches new incident response exercise - NCSC NZ launches - “a new resource to help New Zealand organisations test their incident response plan and, in turn, help to improve their cyber resilience.”\n\nResearch shows most Kiwi are positive about cyber security, wary of AI tools - NCSC NZ researches - “results of an annual international survey on cyber security attitudes and behaviours, titled Oh Behave!. Over 6,500 individuals across New Zealand, the United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, and India were asked about key cybersecurity behaviours, attitudes and trends.”\n\nDutch government will replace hackable traffic lights to avoid movie-like carnage - Cyber News reports - “The solution, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management soon confirmed, was to replace the traffic lights completely. There are tens of thousands of them, though, so the process will take time – the plan is to finish replacing the traffic lights by 2030.” - this is technical debt!\n\nGrowing Cyber threats prompt Philippine Army’s 1st 16th AF visit - US Air Force announces - “Colonel Edward Rivera, 616th Operations Center, director of operations, welcomed Philippine Army Col. Windell Rebong, Command and Control Communications and Cyber Systems, deputy assistant chief, and five associates, here, July 18, for a subject-matter-expert exchange amid rising cyberattacks.”\n\nFree support for small businesses [in Australia] that face cyber attacks - The North West Star reports - “The $11.1 million small business cyber resilience service will offer free, one-on-one assistance to small business owners to help them recover from and build resilience against cyber attacks The federal government has appointed IDCARE, a not-for-profit advisory group, to run the service.”\n\nSemiconductors\n\nAI chip packaging drives peak investment at Japan's Ibiden - Nikkei Asia reports - “Japanese chip packaging supplier Ibiden has been busy expanding capacity to manufacture advanced products for the artificial intelligence market. The spending includes two factories in Gifu prefecture that are due to be up and running in the next few years.”\n\nHuawei is sending samples of its new AI chip meant to rival Nvidia - South China Morning Post reports - “Huawei has offered samples of its Ascend 910C processor to large Chinese server companies for hardware testing and configuration, according to two sources briefed by the matter. The chip, an upgraded version of the 910B, is being offered to large Chinese internet firms, which are also major Nvidia customers, according to one of the sources, a distributor of Huawei AI chips.”\n\nReporting on/from China\n\nEight jailed after China used crypto to pay its spies in Taiwan - DL News reports - “This case effectively halted the continued leak of military secrets and uncovered the Chinese Communist Party’s new criminal tactic of offering bribes in the form of virtual currency,”\n\nBusiness Priorities of Chinese Cyber Range Providers Go Hand in Hand with State Cyber Capability Development - Natto Thoughts asserts - “China’s cyber range market booms, fueled by the state’s demand for developing capable cyber talent and improving the effectiveness of “attack and defense live-fire capability”\n\nTracking China Leaked Documents - four part Japanese analysis by NHK of the alleged activities of i-Soon\n\nTools for Manipulating Public Opinion\n\nCyber ​​Attack\n\nThe Real Face of Hacker Companies\n\nPublic Security\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nAutomated Red Teaming with GOAT: the Generative Offensive Agent Tester - Meta researches - “We instantiate GOAT with 7 red teaming attacks by prompting a general-purpose model in a way that encourages reasoning through the choices of methods available, the current target model's response, and the next steps. Our approach is designed to be extensible and efficient, allowing human testers to focus on exploring new areas of risk while automation covers the scaled adversarial stress-testing of known risk territory. We present the design and evaluation of GOAT, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with an ASR@10 of 97% against Llama 3.1 and 88% against GPT-4 on the JailbreakBench dataset.”\n\nShadowLogic - HiddenLayer researches - “[We] discovered a novel method for creating backdoors in neural network models dubbed ‘ShadowLogic’. Using this technique, an adversary can implant codeless, surreptitious backdoors in models of any modality by manipulating a model’s ‘graph’ – the computational graph representation of the model’s architecture. Backdoors created using this technique will persist through fine-tuning, meaning foundation models can be hijacked to trigger attacker-defined behavior in any downstream application when a trigger input is received, making this attack technique a high-impact AI supply chain risk.\n\nThe Bletchley Park process could be a building block for global cooperation on AI safety - Brookings think tanks - “While progress to date has been significant, major challenges to reaching agreement on a networked approach to AI safety remain. The following takes a closer look at where the Bletchley Park process now stands in the run-up to Paris 2025.”\n\nChina Telecom say AI model with 1 trillion parameters trained with Chinese chips- South China Morning Post reports - “The Institute of AI at China Telecom, one of the country’s large state-backed telecoms operators, said in a statement on Saturday that its open-source TeleChat2-115B and a second unnamed model were trained on tens of thousands of domestically produced chips, marking a milestone amid tightening US restrictions on China’s access to advanced semiconductors, including Nvidia’s latest AI chips.”\n\nHow do Workers Adjust to Robots? Evidence from China - The Economic Journal reports - “We find that a one standard deviation increase in robot exposure led to a decline in labour force participation (-1%), employment (-7%), and hourly earnings (-8%) of Chinese workers. At the same time, among those who kept working, robot exposure increased the number of hours worked by 8%. These effects were concentrated among the less educated and larger among men, prime-age, and older workers”\n\nTianyi Cloud Xiran Integrated Intelligent Computing Service Platform - Sina Finance reports - “The training and pushing service capabilities were significantly upgraded, with new closed-source, multi-modal base large models and data sets, supporting large-scale training of tens of thousands of cards, and further improving training stability.”\n\nCyber proliferation\n\nBlacklisted Israeli cyberintelligence firms hope for Trump victory - intelligence Online reports - “The military conflict in the Middle East is pushing the lobbyists of blacklisted Israeli cyberintelligence firms to redouble their efforts in the run-up to the November US presidential election.”\n\nBounty Hunting\n\nUkrainian National Pleads Guilty to “Raccoon Infostealer” Cybercrime - US Department of Justice announces - “According to court documents, Mark Sokolovsky, 28, conspired to operate the Raccoon Infostealer as a malware-as-a-service or “MaaS.” Individuals who deployed Raccoon Infostealer to steal data from victims leased access to the malware for approximately $200 per month, paid for by cryptocurrency. These individuals used various ruses, such as email phishing, to install the malware onto the computers of unsuspecting victims”\n\nThe ransomware battle is shifting — so should our response - Financial Times opeds - “Earlier this year an attack against a US health insurance giant shut down operations at hospitals and pharmacies for weeks, costing the company a reported $872mn. This does not include the $22mn ransom payment that the company made to a Russia-based gang. On the other side of the world, a ransomware attack shut down the Port of Nagoya — Japan’s busiest port — for two full days.” .. “Some insurance company policies — for example covering reimbursement of ransomware payments — incentivise payment of ransoms that fuel cyber crime ecosystems. This is a troubling practice that must end.”\n\nReflections this week around the fact that know more about what is in our sausages than our software.\n\nSBOMs tell us that 3rd party libraries are patched but not that the 1st party code is 25 years old, in a memory unsafe language of which only 8% has been touched in the last 4 years.\n\nTransparency in technology has a way to go if we are to make informed decisions..\n\nThink someone else would benefit?

Many gaps in the understanding, but also re-enforces why removable media is not a great look in 2024.\n\nGoldenJackal used a custom toolset to target air-gapped systems at a South Asian embassy in Belarus since at least August 2019. In this blogpost, we describe these tools publicly for the first time.\n\nThis blogpost also features the first public description of a highly modular toolset GoldenJackal deployed on various occasions between May 2022 and March 2024 against a national government organization of a country in the European Union.\n\nThese toolsets provide GoldenJackal a wide set of capabilities for compromising and persisting in targeted networks. Victimized systems are abused to collect interesting information, process the information, exfiltrate files, and distribute files, configurations and commands to other systems.\n\nThe ultimate goal of GoldenJackal seems to be stealing confidential information, especially from high-profile machines that might not be connected to the internet.\n\n…\n\nin the GoldenHowl malware, the C&C protocol is referred to as transport_http, which is an expression typically used by Turla (see our ComRat v4 report) and MoustachedBouncer. This may indicate that the developers of GoldenHowl are Russian speakers.\n\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/mind-air-gap-goldenjackal-gooses-government-guardrails/\n\nAnalysis of attack activities of APT-C-20 (APT28) using compound attack tactics\n\nChinese report on this alleged Russian threat actor which isn’t really notable for any other fact that the reporting comes from China.\n\nIn another common attack method of APT28, attackers usually send phishing emails containing malicious links to target users. Once the user clicks on the link, they will be redirected to a bait page carefully designed by the attacker and induce the user to click on a specific button or link.\n\nWhen users are fooled and click on the malicious button in the bait page, they will be further directed to a WebDAV server. On this server, the attacker pre-installed a malicious LNK shortcut file. Once the victim double-clicks these LNK files, a series of malicious activities will be triggered without their knowledge.\n\nhttps://mp-weixin-qq-com.translate.goog/s?__biz=MzUyMjk4NzExMA%3D%3D&mid=2247501024&idx=1&sn=d93b1d195596dcc3d5fb41ca18006dfe&chksm=f9c1f7e9ceb67effd3a5e2bf3a5a6f1212e95dc748f6bd353890ab1454bfc53887caeb40bb6d&scene=178&cur_album_id=1955835290309230595&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp#rd\n\nReporting on China\n\nChinese Threat Groups That Use Ransomware and Ransomware Groups That Use Chinese Names\n\nNatto Thoughts alleged that the number of Chinese ransomware operations is increasing. Interesting is the alleged politically motivated attack in 2023 against the gambling industry.\n\nExamining cases of ransomware activities linked to Chinese threat actors shows an increase in the deployment of ransomware since 2016. The majority of the cases that threat hunters have revealed were politically motivated and conducted by threat actors with some degree of relationship to the Chinese state. (The Spectrum of State Responsibility, which cyber law researcher Jason Healey introduced in 2012, categorizes variations on the criminal/state relationship in hacking operations, ranging from “state-prohibited” to “state-encouraged” to “state-integrated.”) Chinese threat actors use ransomware to cause misattribution, distraction, disruption or even destruction and to provide financial gain, cover for espionage operations and the ability to remove the evidence.\n\nnattothoughts.substack.com/p/chinese-threat-groups-that-use-ransomware\n\nReporting on North Korea\n\nAnalysis of Kimsuky Group's 'BlueShark' Threat Tactics A Deep Dive into the Kimsuky Threat Tactics & BlueShark\n\nGenians reenforces what is known about these alleged North Korean groups which act as a useful summary / reminder.\n\n● Use of various types of malware such as LNK, ISO, MSC, HWP, etc.\n\n● Attempt to access by disguising it as an interview, special lecture, or lecture request\n\n● Delivery of malicious files through the cloud such as OneDrive, Proton Drive, etc.\n\nhttps://www-genians-co-kr.translate.goog/blog/threat_intelligence/blueshark?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp\n\nAnalysis of cyberattacks from North Korea and Konni attack artifacts\n\nIgloo provides what they alleged is analysis of changes in this North Korean threat actor’s techniques. If nothing else it highlights the need to deal with the very many vulnerable WordPress instances - as where one threat actor innovates others are Likely to follow.\n\nSo far, we have looked at the current status of the Konni group, one of the North Korean attack groups, and their representative malware. If we classify the characteristics of Konni's recent attacks, they can be classified into four types:\n\nChanges in social engineering attack keywords,\n\nChanges in attack vectors according to usage environment,\n\nUse of remotely controlled malware for information theft, and\n\nC2 construction using WordPress.\n\nhttps://www-igloo-co-kr.translate.goog/security-information/%EB%B6%81%ED%95%9C%EB%B0%9C-%EC%82%AC%EC%9D%B4%EB%B2%84-%EA%B3%B5%EA%B2%A9%EA%B3%BC-%EC%BD%94%EB%8B%88konni%EC%9D%98-%EA%B3%B5%EA%B2%A9-%EC%95%84%ED%8B%B0%ED%8C%A9%ED%8A%B8-%EB%B6%84%EC%84%9D/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp\n\nReporting on Iran\n\nNothing this week\n\nReporting on Other Actors\n\nFile hosting services misused for identity phishing\n\nMicrosoft details an evolution in tradecraft to avoid detection but also misuse trusted placed in the legitimate functionality.\n\nSince mid-April 2024, we observed threat actors increasingly use these tactics aimed at circumventing defense mechanisms:\n\nFiles with restricted access: The files sent through the phishing emails are configured to be accessible solely to the designated recipient. This requires the recipient to be signed in to the file-sharing service—be it Dropbox, OneDrive, or SharePoint—or to re-authenticate by entering their email address along with a one-time password (OTP) received through a notification service.\n\nFiles with view-only restrictions: To bypass analysis by email detonation systems, the files shared in these phishing attacks are set to ‘view-only’ mode, disabling the ability to download and consequently, the detection of embedded URLs within the file.\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/10/08/file-hosting-services-misused-for-identity-phishing/\n\nMamba 2FA: A new contender in the AiTM phishing ecosystem\n\nGrégoire Clermont highlights what cotemporary Adversary in The Middle capability looks like. Note the degree of opsec to trip up auto scanners but also to mask their infrastructure.\n\nUntil late September 2024, the relay servers were connecting directly to the Entra ID servers when performing authentications with victim’s credentials. As a result, the IP addresses of the relay servers were exposed in the authentication logs of the targeted tenants. However, starting October 2024, the developers of Mamba 2FA implemented an additional indirection layer, utilising proxy servers sourced from a commercial provider (IPRoyal). In consequence, the IP addresses appearing in authentication logs since October 2024 are those of the datacenter proxies, not the relay servers. (These proxy servers are not pictured on the architecture schema above).\n\nhttps://blog.sekoia.io/mamba-2fa-a-new-contender-in-the-aitm-phishing-ecosystem/\n\nDiscovery\n\nHow we find and understand the latent compromises within our environments.\n\nNetwork traffic large model TrafficLLM\n\nChina bringing LLM to network traffic analysis and some security use cases…\n\nTrafficLLM jointly released by Dr. Cui Tianyu of Zhongguancun Laboratory and the team of Professor Xu Ke and Professor Li Qi of Tsinghua University.\n\nThrough appropriate learning, TrafficLLM can form two core capabilities of traffic detection and generation on a wide range of downstream tasks such as encrypted traffic classification and APT detection. Compared with 15 state-of-the-art traffic detection and generation solutions, TrafficLLM can achieve F1 scores of 0.9875 and 0.9483, with performance improvements of 80.12% and 33.92% respectively. We further demonstrate TrafficLLM's strong generalization ability to unknown data and real-world environments.\n\nhttps://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&hl=en&u=https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/pt2CfG0i9Fex-sy7-dcoyg&client=webapp\n\nhttps://github.com/ZGC-LLM-Safety/TrafficLLM\n\nDefence\n\nHow we proactively defend our environments.\n\nWindows 11 Administrator Protection | Admin Approval Mode\n\nRudyooms details how this new feature works..\n\nThis feature is designed to eliminate always-on admin rights. Instead, it uses a hidden elevation mechanism to provide just-in-time privileges when needed, keeping admin rights in the shadows until required.\n\nThe introduction of Administrator Protection and the System Managed Admin Account concept marks a fundamental shift in managing local admin rights. Microsoft mitigates many traditional UAC vulnerabilities by decoupling elevated tasks from the main user context, making the local admin a safer role.\n\nhttps://call4cloud.nl/2024/10/windows11-administrator-protection/\n\nPasskeys on Windows: Authenticate seamlessly with passkey providers\n\nKatharine Holdsworth outlines how passkeys deployment are going to become ever more compelling.

(“Company” or “CRMZ”) detected unauthorized occurrences within its computer network. Upon detecting the unauthorized occurrences, the Company immediately activated its incident response plan and began taking steps to contain, assess and remediate the incident, including conducting an investigation with third-party cybersecurity specialists. CRMZ reported the incident to law enforcement and continues to cooperate with law enforcement’s investigation. The incident has not had a material impact on the Company’s operations, and its information systems have continued to be fully operational.\n\nThe Company’s investigation determined that certain files stored within CRMZ’s computer environment may have been viewed or copied by an unauthorized actor between July 8, 2024 and July 17, 2024. CRMZ reviewed the files that could have been viewed or copied to determine whether any sensitive information was contained within those files. The Company’s investigation concluded that personally identifiable information of employees and independent contractors, not customers, may have been viewed or copied by an unauthorized actor. Although CRMZ is not aware of any attempted or actual misuse of that personally identifiable information, on October 8, 2024, CRMZ issued notices to individuals whose personal information was stored within the impacted files so that they may take steps to protect their information, if they feel it is appropriate to do so. CRMZ is offering access to credit monitoring and identity theft protection services at no cost to those individuals for twenty-four (24) months.\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315958/000114036124043034/ef20036707_8k.htm\n\nADT Inc.\n\n#2\n\nADT Inc. (“ADT” or the “Company”) recently became aware of unauthorized activity on the Company’s network, and discovered an unauthorized actor had illegally accessed ADT’s network using compromised credentials obtained through a third-party business partner.\n\nThe Company promptly took steps to shut down the unauthorized access, notified the third party its systems had been compromised, launched an investigation, and implemented counter measures intended to safeguard the Company’s information technology assets and operations. ADT has hired leading third-party cybersecurity experts to assist with the Company’s response to the incident, and is working closely with federal law enforcement. The Company is also cooperating closely with its third-party business partner to address the incident.\n\nThe Company believes the unauthorized actor exfiltrated certain encrypted internal ADT data associated with employee user accounts during the intrusion. Based on its investigation to date, the Company does not believe customers’ personal information has been exfiltrated, or that customers’ security systems have been compromised. ADT’s containment measures have resulted in some disruptions to the Company’s information systems, and the Company’s investigation is at an early stage and ongoing.\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1703056/000119312524233900/d876174d8k.htm\n\nConsumer routers targeted by multiple botnets\n\nNCSC Netherlands details how you can have co-habiting botnets on routers..\n\nThe National Cyber ​​Security Centre (NCSC) has, following an incident response investigation, observed two botnet malware families simultaneously on a consumer router: Alogin botnet malware and TheMoon malware.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass SAML authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access by exploiting a flaw in how SAML responses are handled. The issue arises due to weaknesses in the verification of the digital signature used to protect SAML assertions, allowing attackers to manipulate the SAML response and bypass critical security checks.\n\nhttps://blog.projectdiscovery.io/ruby-saml-gitlab-auth-bypass/\n\nThe PrintNightmare is not Over Yet\n\nItm4n’s provides some insight into a configuration which can’t actually be secured..\n\nFollowing the publication of my blog post A Practical Guide to PrintNightmare in 2024, a few people brought to my attention that there was a way to bypass the Point and Print (PnP) restrictions recommended at the end. So, rather than just updating this article with a quick note, I decided to dig a little deeper, and see if I could find a better way to protect against the exploitation of PnP configurations\n\n..\n\nThe key takeaway is that the seemingly innocuous statement “There is no combination of mitigations that is equivalent to setting Restrict Driver Installation To Administrators to 1” in the Microsoft KB article KB5005652 - Manage new Point and Print default driver installation behavior (CVE-2021-34481) should actually be considered literally.

      "# [Solving Windows 11 Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) Problems](https://itfix.org.uk/solving-windows-11-windows-defender-application-control-wdac-problems/)\nUnderstanding WDAC and Its Challenges\n\nAs a seasoned IT professional, you’ve likely encountered your fair share of technology challenges, and one that has been particularly vexing for many is the implementation of Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) on Windows 11 systems. WDAC is a powerful security feature that aims to prevent the execution of untrusted or malicious software, but its deployment and configuration can be complex and often frustrating.\n\nOne of the primary issues that IT professionals face when deploying WDAC is the difficulty in creating reliable and comprehensive policies. The WDAC Wizard, touted as a savior for policy creation, is often found to be unreliable, with users reporting that trusted publishers and file hashes fail to be added consistently, and that the generated XML policies sometimes strip out crucial rules during updates.\n\nThis inconsistency has led many IT teams to opt for the more familiar AppLocker solution, which allows for the creation and management of application control policies directly within local group policy. The ability to export AppLocker policies as XML and ingest them into Microsoft Intune makes it a more straightforward option for many organizations.\n\nHowever, as Microsoft continues to push WDAC as the preferred solution for application control, it’s essential for IT professionals to understand the nuances of this technology and learn how to overcome the challenges associated with its deployment and management.\n\nRecent Improvements to WDAC in Windows 10 20H2 and Beyond\n\nFortunately, recent updates to WDAC have addressed some of the key pain points that early adopters experienced. In the Windows 10 20H2 release and beyond, Microsoft has introduced several improvements that make WDAC a more viable option for IT teams.\n\nOne of the significant changes is the ability to build WDAC policies on Windows 10 Professional systems, rather than being restricted to the Enterprise edition. This added flexibility allows more organizations to experiment with WDAC and develop policies that align with their specific needs.\n\nAdditionally, the DefaultWindows_Audit.xml template policy provided by Microsoft has been a valuable starting point for many IT professionals. This policy allows in-box kernel and user-mode code to boot, execute, and update without issue, providing a solid foundation for building more comprehensive WDAC policies.\n\nCrafting a Simple, Secure WDAC Policy\n\nTo demonstrate the improved capabilities of WDAC, let’s walk through the process of creating a simple yet highly secure policy that can be deployed on a Windows 11 system.\n\nStep 1: Modify the DefaultWindows_Audit.xml Policy\n\nAs mentioned, the DefaultWindows_Audit.xml policy provided by Microsoft is an excellent starting point. We’ll make a few modifications to this template to create a policy that aligns with our specific requirements.\n\nDisable Script Enforcement Options: We’ll add the following line to the policy to disable script enforcement options, allowing unsigned PowerShell scripts and interactive PowerShell to run without restriction:\n\n“`xml\n\n“`\n\nDisable .NET Application and Library Enforcement: We’ll remove the following line from the policy, as it enables enforcement for .NET applications and dynamically-loaded libraries, which can cause issues with certain applications:\n\n“`xml\n\n“`\n\nStep 2: Merge in Microsoft’s Recommended Block Rules\n\nIn addition to the modified DefaultWindows_Audit.xml policy, we’ll incorporate the Microsoft-recommended block rules to further enhance the security of our WDAC policy.\n\nStep 3: Merge and Deploy the Policy\n\nOnce we’ve made the necessary modifications, we can use the following PowerShell cmdlets to merge the policies and deploy them to our Windows 11 system:\n\n“`powershell\n\n$DefaultWindowsAudit = ‘DefaultWindows_Audit.xml’\n\n$MicrosoftRecommendedBlockRules = ‘Microsoft_Recommended_BlockRules.xml’\n\n$MergedPolicy = ‘MergedWDACPolicy.xml’\n\nConvertFrom-CIPolicy -XmlFilePath $DefaultWindowsAudit, $MicrosoftRecommendedBlockRules -OutputFilePath $MergedPolicy\n\nSet-CIPolicy -FilePath $MergedPolicy\n\n“`\n\nStep 4: Audit and Enforce the Policy\n\nAfter deploying the policy, we’ll first run it in audit mode to ensure that there are no unexpected issues or application compatibility problems. Once we’re satisfied with the results, we can then remove the “Enabled:Audit Mode” rule to place WDAC into enforcement mode.\n\nMonitoring and Maintaining the WDAC Policy\n\nWith the WDAC policy in place, it’s essential to monitor its performance and address any issues that may arise. We can keep an eye on CodeIntegrity event log events to identify any block events, which will help us fine-tune the policy as needed.\n\nAdditionally, there are further steps that can be taken to secure the integrity of the deployed WDAC policy, such as policy signing and UEFI policy protection, but these may not be necessary for all use cases.\n\nThe Benefits of a Robust WDAC Implementation\n\nImplementing a well-designed WDAC policy can provide significant security benefits for your organization. By enforcing code integrity, you can effectively mitigate a large number of attack techniques, reducing the burden on your security teams to detect and respond to a wide range of threats.\n\nAs a security practitioner, I’ve seen firsthand the power of WDAC in protecting systems from external and even self-inflicted threats. When properly configured, WDAC can serve as a crucial layer of defense, complementing other security measures and providing a reliable, built-in solution for protecting your Windows 11 environments.\n\nWhile the initial deployment of WDAC may seem daunting, the improvements made in recent Windows 10 and 11 releases have made it a more viable and practical option for IT professionals. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can create a simple yet highly secure WDAC policy that can be easily deployed and maintained, providing your organization with enhanced protection against a wide range of security threats.",

      "# [Microsoft Store error codes, descriptions, resolution: Complete list by AnandK@TWC, www.facebook.com, The-Windows-Club on 2024-12-08](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/complete-list-of-windows-store-error-codes-descriptions-resolution)\nEvery time an error occurs in Microsoft Store, there is a code left behind. While these codes have no meaning to end-users, if given to the technical support team, they can help. However, Microsoft has these codes already on its website, with resolutions available for the same. Here is a list of Error Codes for Microsoft Store apps, sourced from Microsoft MSDN. It gives the code, and message causes along with description, and suggested workaround or resolution method.\n\nList of Microsoft Store error codes, descriptions, resolution\n\nWhile all the error codes have a description, some of the codes have resolution or causes or debugging or workaround. So in case you don’t find a solution, you can always search for those codes on our website.\n\nThe Error Code, Description and Resolution/Workaround have been mentioned against each.\n\n0x80073CFB\n\nERROR_PACKAGE_ALREADY_EXISTS\n\nThe provided package is already installed, and the reinstallation of the package is blocked.\n\nYou may get this error if installing a package that is not bitwise identical to the package that is already installed. Note that the digital signature is also part of the package. Hence if a package is rebuilt or resigned, it is no longer bitwise identical to the previously installed package.\n\nTwo possible options to fix this error are: (1) Increment the version number of the app, then rebuild and resign the package (2) Remove the old package for every user on the system before installing the new package.\n\n0x80073CF0\n\nERROR_INSTALL_OPEN_PACKAGE_FAILED\n\nThe package couldn’t be opened.\n\nThe package is unsigned, The publisher name doesn’t match the signing certificate subject, The file:// prefix is missing or the package couldn’t be found at the specified location.\n\nSuggestions: Check the AppxPackagingOM event log for more info.\n\n0x80073CF2\n\nERROR_INSTALL_INVALID_PACKAGE\n\nThe package data isn’t valid.\n\n0x80073D00\n\nERROR_PACKAGE_UPDATING\n\nThe app can’t be started because it’s currently updating.\n\n0x80073D01\n\nERROR_DEPLOYMENT_BLOCKED_BY_POLICY\n\nThe package deployment operation is blocked by policy. Contact your system administrator.\n\nPackage deployment is blocked by Application Control Policies, Package deployment is blocked by the “Allow deployment operations in special profiles” policy. One of the possible reasons is the need for a roaming profile.\n\nSee Deploy Roaming User Profiles to set up Roaming User Profiles on user accounts. If there are no policies configured on your system and you still see this error, perhaps you are logged in with a temporary profile. Log out and log in again, then try the operation again.\n\n0x80073CF4\n\nERROR_INSTALL_OUT_OF_DISK_SPACE\n\nThere isn’t enough disk space on your computer. Free some space and try again.\n\n0x80073CF5\n\nERROR_INSTALL_NETWORK_FAILURE\n\nThe package can’t be downloaded.\n\n0x80073CF6\n\nERROR_INSTALL_REGISTRATION_FAILURE\n\nThe package can’t be registered.\n\n0x80D0000A\n\nTo resolve the error 0x80D0000A, run the WSReset.exe command. Also ensure that Windows Firewall Service is enabled.\n\n0x800700B\n\nERROR_BAD_FORMAT\n\nThe package isn’t correctly formatted and needs to be re-built or re-signed. You may get this error if there is a mismatch between the signing certificate subject name and the AppxManifest.xml publisher name.\n\n0x80073CF7\n\nERROR_INSTALL_DEREGISTRATION_FAILURE\n\nThe package can’t be unregistered. You may get this error while removing a package.\n\n0x80073CF8\n\nERROR_INSTALL_CANCEL\n\nThe user canceled the install request.\n\n0x80073CF9\n\nERROR_INSTALL_FAILED\n\nThe package install failed. Contact the software vendor.\n\n0x80073CFA\n\nERROR_REMOVE_FAILED\n\nPackage removal failed. You may get this error for failures that occur during the package uninstall.\n\nERROR_INSTALL_PACKAGE_NOT_FOUND\n\nThe package couldn’t be found.\n\nYou may get this error while removing a package that isn’t installed for the current user.\n\n0x80073CFC\n\nERROR_NEEDS_REMEDIATION\n\nThe app can’t be started. Try reinstalling the app.\n\n0x80073CFD\n\nERROR_INSTALL_PREREQUISITE_FAILED\n\nA specified install prerequisite couldn’t be satisfied.\n\n0x80073CFE\n\nERROR_PACKAGE_REPOSITORY_CORRUPTED\n\nThe package repository is corrupted.\n\nYou may get this error if the folder referenced by this registry key doesn’t exist or is corrupted:\n\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentV ersion\\Appx\\PackageRepositoryRoot\n\nTo recover from this state, refresh your PC.\n\n0x80073CFF\n\nERROR_INSTALL_POLICY_FAILURE\n\nTo install this app, you need a developer license or a sideloading-enabled system.\n\nDebugging: You may get this error if the package doesn’t meet one of the following requirements: The app is deployed using F5 in Visual Studio on a computer with a Windows Store developer license,\n\nThe package is signed with a Microsoft signature and deployed as part of Windows or from the Windows Store, The package is signed with a trusted signature and installed on a computer with a Windows Store developer license, a domain-joined computer with the AllowAllTrustedApps policy enabled, or a computer with a Windows Sideloading license with the AllowAllTrustedApps policy enabled.\n\n0x80073D02\n\nERROR_PACKAGES_IN_USE\n\nThe package couldn’t be installed because the resources it modifies are currently in use.\n\n0x80073D03\n\nERROR_RECOVERY_FILE_CORRUPT\n\nThe package couldn’t be recovered because the data that’s necessary for recovery is corrupted.\n\n0x80073D04\n\nERROR_INVALID_STAGED_SIGNATURE\n\nThe signature isn’t valid. To register in developer mode, AppxSignature.p7x and AppxBlockMap.xml must be valid or shouldn’t be present\n\nPossible workaround: If you are a developer using F5 with Visual Studio, ensure that your built project directory doesn’t contain signature or block map files from previous versions of the package.\n\n0x80073D05\n\nERROR_DELETING_EXISTING_APPLICATIONDATA_STORE_FAILED\n\nAn error occurred while deleting the package’s previously existing application data. Cause: You get this error if the simulator is running. Close the simulator.\n\n0x80073D06\n\nERROR_INSTALL_PACKAGE_DOWNGRADE\n\nNo details found.\n\n0x80073D07\n\nERROR_SYSTEM_NEEDS_REMEDIATION\n\nAn error in a system binary was detected. Try refreshing the PC to fix the problem.\n\n0x80073D08\n\nERROR_APPX_INTEGRITY_FAILURE_EXTERNAL\n\nA corrupted non-Windows binary was detected on the system.\n\n0x80073D09\n\nERROR_RESILIENCY_FILE_CORRUPT\n\nThe operation couldn’t be resumed because data that’s necessary for recovery is corrupted.\n\n0x80073CF3\n\nERROR_INSTALL_RESOLVE_DEPENDENCY_FAILED\n\nThe package failed to update, dependency, or conflict validation.\n\nCauses: The incoming package conflicts with an installed package, A specified package dependency can’t be found, The package doesn’t support the correct processor architecture.\n\nDebugging: Check the AppXDeployment-Server event log for more info.\n\n0x80070057\n\nE_INVALIDARG\n\nOne or more arguments are not valid If you check the AppXDeployment-Server event log and see the following event; “While installing the package, the system failed to register the windows repository extension due to the following error: The parameter is incorrect.”\n\nCause: You may get this error if the manifest elements DisplayName\n\nDescription: contain characters disallowed by Windows firewall; namely “|” and “all”, due to which Windows fails to create the AppContainer profile for the package. Please remove these characters from the manifest and try installing the package.\n\n0x80073D0A\n\nERROR_INSTALL_FIREWALL_SERVICE_NOT_RUNNING\n\nThe package couldn’t be installed because the Windows Firewall service isn’t running. Enable the Windows Firewall service and try again.\n\n0x800B0100\n\nTRUST_E_NOSIGNATURE\n\nNo signature is present in the subject. Cause: You may get this error if the package is unsigned or the signature isn’t valid. The package must be signed to be deployed.\n\n0x800B0109\n\nCERT_E_UNTRUSTEDROOT\n\nA certificate chain processed but terminated in a root certificate that isn’t trusted by the trusted provider.\n\n0x800B010A\n\nCERT_E_CHAINING\n\nA certificate chain couldn’t be built to a trusted root certification authority.\n\n0x80080209\n\nAPPX_E_INVALID_SIP_CLIENT_DATA\n\nThe SIP_SUBJECTINFOstructure used to sign the package didn’t contain the required data\n\n0x80080200\n\nAPPX_E_PACKAGING_INTERNAL\n\nThe packaging API has encountered an internal error.\n\n0x80080201\n\nAPPX_E_INTERLEAVING_NOT_ALLOWED\n\nThe package isn’t valid because its contents are interleaved.\n\n0x80080202\n\nAPPX_E_RELATIONSHIPS_NOT_ALLOWED\n\nThe package isn’t valid because it contains OPC relationships.\n\n0x80080203\n\nAPPX_E_MISSING_REQUIRED_FILE\n\nThe package isn’t valid because it’s missing a manifest or block map, or a code integrity file is present but a signature file is missing. Workaround: Ensure that the package isn’t missing one or more of these required files: \\AppxManifest.xml and \\AppxBlockMap.xml. If the package contains \\AppxMetadata\\CodeIntegrity.cat it must also contain \\AppxSignature.p7x.\n\n0x80080204\n\nAPPX_E_INVALID_MANIFEST\n\nThe package’s AppxManifest.xml file isn’t valid.\n\n0x80080205\n\nAPPX_E_INVALID_BLOCKMAP\n\nThe package’s AppxBlockMap.xml file isn’t valid.\n\n0x80080206\n\nAPPX_E_CORRUPT_CONTENT\n\nThe package contents can’t be read because it’s corrupted.\n\n0x80080207\n\nAPPX_E_BLOCK_HASH_INVALID\n\nThe computed hash value of the block doesn’t match the has a value stored in the block map.\n\n0x80080208\n\nAPPX_E_REQUESTED_RANGE_TOO_LARGE\n\nThe requested byte range is over 4 GB when translated to a byte-range of blocks.\n\nI hope the codes were useful, and you were able to find out the meaning of the codes, and workarounds for those listed.\n\nSpeaking of Error Codes, these posts too, are likely to be of interest to you:"

    "# Comprehensive Report on CodeIntegrity\n\n## Company Overview\n**CodeIntegrity** is a security feature integrated into Microsoft Windows, specifically designed to ensure that only trusted code is executed on a system. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the operating system by enforcing policies that restrict the execution of untrusted or malicious software. This feature is part of a broader suite of security measures that Microsoft has implemented to protect users from various cyber threats.\n\n## Product Overview\n**CodeIntegrity** is primarily focused on application control and code integrity verification. It utilizes policies to determine which applications are allowed to run, thereby preventing unauthorized code execution. This is particularly important in environments where security is paramount, such as enterprise settings.\n\n### Key Features\n- **User Mode Code Integrity (UMCI)**: This feature ensures that only signed binaries can run in user mode, which helps prevent the execution of malicious software.\n- **Dynamic Code Security**: This allows for real-time enforcement of code integrity policies, adapting to changes in the system environment.\n- **Policy Management**: Administrators can create and manage policies that dictate which applications are allowed to run, providing granular control over the execution environment.\n\n## Recent Developments\n### Vulnerability Mitigation\nA recent update highlighted a vulnerability (CVE-2024-21302) in Windows that could allow an attacker with administrator privileges to replace updated system files with older versions, potentially bypassing Virtualization-based security (VBS) features. Microsoft has responded by updating the SkuSiPolicy.p7b policy, which is crucial for blocking vulnerable system files from being loaded [(Microsoft, Support, August 13, 2024)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/guidance-for-blocking-rollback-of-virtualization-based-security-vbs-related-security-updates-b2e7ebf4-f64d-4884-a390-38d63171b8d3).\n\n### Transition to Trusted Signing\nThe Device Guard Signing Service (DGSSv2) is being deprecated, and users are encouraged to transition to the Trusted Signing service for code integrity policy signing. This change is expected to enhance the security of code signing processes and requires users to have an Azure account for access [(Microsoft, Learn, September 11, 2024)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/trusted-signing/how-to-device-guard-signing-service-migration).\n\n## Company Scale\nWhile specific employee numbers for CodeIntegrity are not publicly available, it is a feature of Microsoft Windows, which has over 1.5 billion active devices worldwide.
