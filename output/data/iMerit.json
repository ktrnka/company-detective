      "# [Sentiment Analysis Services on 2021-07-09](https://imerit.net/sentiment-analysis/)\nSo much of interpersonal communication goes beyond the words a person uses. Sentiment analysis comes naturally to us humans, as we learn to identify and navigate non-verbal cues, tones of voice, and general demeanors that effectively convey feelings of happiness, sadness, anger, and apathy. Online, these non-verbal cues manifest as emojis, punctuation, and images such as GIFs.\n\nComputers, by comparison, must be taught to understand the spectrum of human sentiment. Positive sentiment and negative sentiment can be subtle and need not have high polarity. Thus, training a computer to accurately detect sentiment within a given text can be a challenging task that requires high-quality human language datasets in order to be effective. Sentiment analysis is a valuable NLP application that’s built on unstructured text datasets, word classifications, positive/negative/neutral phrasing, and is over the infinite complexities of varying categories, topics, and entities within a phrase.\n\nClient Profile: Large private equity firm\n\nClient data type: Images of private equity firm reports\n\nChallenge: Building a training and validation dataset that precisely identifies and separates invaluable information from noise. As projects like this scale, so too does annotation complexity.\n\nVolume: Over 10 million NLP data points\n\nOutcome: The resulting pattern recognition was infused with true subject-matter expertise, and could effectively identify sentiment in the face of challenging discourse."

I'm newbie in Reddit either.\n\nHere's the thing: I applied for 1-1.5month remote AI labelling job from iMerit, the company replied me back, required passing some test questions, I passed... the questions were easy enough.\nNow this is the part I'm feeling weird: The company requires me to buy some screenguard program and headphones before working. It says the company would reimburse it after I start the work.\n\nI'm kinda desperate for cash, tried other AI platforms(ex.dataanottation and oneforma) but did not have good chance, and this email came.\n\nWould it be safe to believe this email? Do you think it's scam? Or is there somebody who has actually worked and reimbursed from this company? Any advices are welcomed. \n\n\n\n## Comment ID mdfba5p with +8 score by [(too_many_shoes14, Reddit, 2025-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1iscimj/im_pretty_new_to_remote_job_field_imerit_scam_or/mdfba5p/) (in reply to ID 1iscimj):\nIt's a scam. AI labeling isn't a real job.  Legit employers send you what you need to do your job.\n\nHere's the truth, unless you have a lot of specialized knowledge or experience you aren't getting a fully remote job which pays all your bills. They are like blue lobsters, they exist but are incredibly rare. The pandemic and scammers convinced people that anybody could work from home and making a living and that simply isn't true. If you're looking for a job you might as well forget fully remote unless you have some unique qualification.\n\n### Comment ID mdfc4v5 with +3 score by [(Impossible_Shape_987, Reddit, 2025-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1iscimj/im_pretty_new_to_remote_job_field_imerit_scam_or/mdfc4v5/) (in reply to ID mdfba5p):\nThanks for the advice, I also think, if I were not desperate, than I wouldn't be hooked to such scammy request of purchases... I guess I just wanted to believe; I'm actually working in legit ai company and it did not require me buying anything. It was great to come here before replying. Thanks again\n\n### Comment ID mdfet24 with +3 score by [(1morgondag1, Reddit, 2025-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1iscimj/im_pretty_new_to_remote_job_field_imerit_scam_or/mdfet24/) (in reply to ID mdfba5p):\nAI labeling is absolutely a real job and real companies like Data Annotation and Alignerr pays people to do that, I did it just last month and got paid.\n\nThis however looks fishy with the requirement to buy equipment. Probably scammers who picked up that this sector exists. If they require you to buy from a particular online vendor then it is definitely a scam.\n\n#### Comment ID mdfgg5k with +2 score by [(t-poke, Reddit, 2025-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1iscimj/im_pretty_new_to_remote_job_field_imerit_scam_or/mdfgg5k/) (in reply to ID mdfet24):\n[Not hot dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvn-hpZdElo)\n\n## Comment ID mdfcv5r with +3 score by [(SecureWriting8589, Reddit, 2025-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1iscimj/im_pretty_new_to_remote_job_field_imerit_scam_or/mdfcv5r/) (in reply to ID 1iscimj):\nThe bastards prey on folks just like you, who are desperate for cash. They send you a check which you deposit and which initially clears and ask you to purchase equipment needed for the job. But the check is fake, and even though it clears initially, the bank finds this out and claws back the money. \n\nBut the money that you send out to purchase your needed gear isn't fake. In the end, they get your good money, and you get nothing but greater debt and an angry bank.\n\n## Comment ID mdfc8xf with +2 score by [(dwinps, Reddit, 2025-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1iscimj/im_pretty_new_to_remote_job_field_imerit_scam_or/mdfc8xf/) (in reply to ID 1iscimj):\nIt is a scam, like 99.9% of the unskilled remote jobs you will run across\n\n## Comment ID mdfitoc with +2 score by [(Acceptable-Bat-9577, Reddit, 2025-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1iscimj/im_pretty_new_to_remote_job_field_imerit_scam_or/mdfitoc/) (in reply to ID 1iscimj):\nAlso avoid “remote data entry” and “remote personal assistant.” 99.999999999% of those jobs are scams. Most remote “AI” jobs are task scams and/or fake check scams as others have noted. Even many technically legit AI jobs are similarly scummy.\n\n## Comment ID mdg28af with +2 score by [(Malsperanza, Reddit, 2025-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1iscimj/im_pretty_new_to_remote_job_field_imerit_scam_or/mdg28af/) (in reply to ID 1iscimj):\nAs others have said: there are very few remote jobs for low-level work. Assume *all* such offers are fake.\n\nThink about it: why would a company pay a recruitment agency to hire a low-level job like data entry, when such agencies charge a fee? Those jobs are easy to fill without that expense. Further, why would a company offer a simple job as a remote one, when they can't supervise the work as easily, and can fill such jobs with employees who work onsite?\n\nIn addition, there are very few jobs where you have to pay money up front in order to start. The company should be supplying the equipment and the training.\n\nAfter Covid, everyone has been hoping to find work-from-home jobs, but those only really exist for an employee who has already established that they are so valuable to the company that it will offer a benefit to keep them. Or, in certain cases, if you have a very specialized skill that the company urgently needs.\n\nWe are seeing many many of these scams attacking job seekers. So as a rule: do not respond to any offer that came out of the blue. You should only respond to offers that were in response to a resume or inquiry that you sent. And even then, if it's a low-level job (picking up extra income, for example), assume that work-from-home \"opportunities\" are all scams. Be very skeptical of any offer that comes from a 3rd party, not the company itself. Verify that it really is the company, and that they really are offering such a job.\n\n## Comment ID mdgp29k with +2 score by [(Princessluna44, Reddit, 2025-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1iscimj/im_pretty_new_to_remote_job_field_imerit_scam_or/mdgp29k/) (in reply to ID 1iscimj):\nUnless you are a skilled professional, you aren't getting a remote job. **EVER**.

For most AI training tools, they mainly work with simple but high volume tasks. A few can work on nuanced projects with complex requirements. For instance, if a requester is in search of high-quality data that requires a highly-skilled AI training workforce, Pareto steps in to handle the project's complexity. This includes its need for weekly iterative changes, customized workflows, and direct communication with labelers throughout the project. Those are the kind of projects that Pareto works on.

      "# [Medical Image Annotation: A Complete Guide by Brett on 2024-12-10](https://imerit.net/blog/medical-image-annotation-a-complete-guide/)\nHealthcare AI is one of the most promising avenues in the healthcare sector and relies heavily on machine learning algorithms to analyze medical data to make predictions or assist in diagnosis and treatment decisions.\n\nThis dependence implies that data annotation and medical data labeling services are crucial in healthcare AI development and implementation. It implies that data annotation is crucial in healthcare AI development and implementation. Diverse sources such as medical imaging devices, diagnosis documents, visual observations, and health data collection applications contribute to the vast influx of data into the healthcare industry. Whether visual (image-like) or textual form, this data serves various purposes, ranging from clinical and research applications to administrative functions.\n\nMedical data image annotation plays a crucial role, as it is essential for training machine learning models that power these innovations. Diverse sources such as medical imaging devices, diagnosis documents, visual observations, and health data collection applications contribute to the vast influx of data into the healthcare industry. Whether visual (image-like) or textual form, this data serves various purposes, ranging from clinical and research applications to administrative functions.\n\nNevertheless, a common characteristic of this raw data is its lack of structure and labels. Ground truth labels for medical data are essential to address this crucial need. Hospitals, universities, and private research institutes are investing time and effort to ingest this labeled medical data and have state-of-the-art models assist the healthcare industry at scale.\n\nIn this blog, we delve into the various types and challenges of medical image annotation while highlighting the crucial factors to consider when choosing a medical image labeling tool and partner. Through this blog, we will uncover the vital role that medical image annotation plays in unlocking the full potential of AI in healthcare.\n\nWhat is Medical Image Annotation and Labeling?\n\nMedical data image annotation and labeling are the processes of adding metadata to medical images to make them machine-readable. However, there are some differences between the two.\n\nMedical Data Image Annotation\n\nThis includes adding additional information to an image, such as labels, bounding boxes, or segmentation masks. This information can help train machine learning models to identify and analyze medical conditions.\n\nMedical Data Image Labeling\n\nIt is the process of assigning a single label to an image. This label can be a simple category, such as normal or abnormal, or something more complex, such as the location and size of a tumor. Labeled medical data is used in two main ways:\n\nResearch: Researchers use labeled medical data to train machine-learning models for developing new medical treatments and diagnostic tools. It is a critical step in building artificial intelligence (AI) for healthcare, as it allows researchers to test and improve their models on large datasets of real-world data.\n\nClinical applications: Labeled medical data has many clinical applications, such as radiology and anomaly detection. Machine learning models can help radiologists diagnose diseases by analyzing medical images. Anomaly detection models can help identify patients at risk for certain diseases or those experiencing abnormal behavior.\n\nBoth research and clinical applications of labeled medical data are critical for AI advancement in healthcare. Researchers use labeled data to develop new AI tools, while clinical applications use AI tools to improve patient care.\n\nMedical Data Preparation\n\nMachine learning models are becoming increasingly important in the healthcare industry, as they can automate tasks, improve diagnostic accuracy, and develop new treatments. However, to train a machine learning model that will give reliable results, it needs training with a decent amount of data labeled at the highest quality.\n\nThe process of preparing medical data for annotation involves a few key steps:\n\nVariety of Datasets\n\nYour data must not come from the same source or should not look the same. For improved reliability, you need the model trained with varied medical datasets. If your model is trained only on a subset of data or on data that all look very similar, it will not know what to do when we show data that looks different.\n\nDataset Vetting Process\n\nOnce you have a variety of datasets, you must vet them to ensure high quality. It includes checking for errors, inconsistencies, and missing data. Splitting your dataset across training, validation, and testing is also helpful. Training will comprise about 80% of your data.\n\nSize of your Dataset\n\nRecent developments in ML have shown that quality is as important as quantity when it comes to training models. It means that a small but high-quality dataset will usually perform equally or even better than a large set of lower quality. That said, if you have the option to enlarge your dataset, we highly recommend doing so, as model results will improve significantly.\n\nFormat of your Dataset\n\nThe two most common medical imaging formats include DICOM and TIFF files, with DICOM being the industry standard for digital radiology. Both formats can contain multiple images or slices and metadata regarding the patient and the image itself. The right medical imaging labeling tool will support both formats.\n\nWhat Makes Medical Data Image Annotation Different from General Data Annotation?\n\nAnnotating and labeling images for healthcare is an altogether different endeavor compared to regular image annotation. Here are some things that are different:\n\nData Availability\n\nWhile regular images are often freely available or behind a standard NDA, medical imaging is usually protected by strict data processing agreements. It is mainly to protect the privacy of the patient. Obtaining medical imaging data is usually challenging as compared to other data types.\n\nMedical imaging is typically protected by strict data processing agreements to protect patient privacy, making it more challenging to obtain than general images.\n\nTechnical Differences\n\nRegular images only have one layer, are of small size, and have a low bit depth. Medical images often have multiple layers (slices), are large, and have a higher bit depth.\n\nFurther, the labeler profiles for both will be different. Generalist data annotators can work on almost all images, but medical imaging annotation requires specialized healthcare experts.\n\nThese experts are used to certain UI and UX paradigms. Therefore, when choosing a data labeling platform, it is critical to note whether medical professionals can easily use its keyboard controls and UI.\n\nTypes of Labeling Tasks\n\nIn healthcare, image classification means assigning a label to an image based on its medical contents. For example, an image classification model could be trained to label images as normal or abnormal.\n\nObject detection is more complex than image classification in the healthcare domain. In addition to labeling an image, object detection also identifies the location of the object in the scene. For example, an object detection model could be trained to identify and locate tumors in medical images.\n\nImage segmentation is a task that breaks an image down into smaller components in the healthcare domain. There are two main types of image segmentation- semantic and instance segmentation.\n\nSemantic segmentation labels each pixel in an image with a category label. For example, a semantic segmentation model could label each pixel as lung, heart, vessel, or tumor.\n\nInstance segmentation labels each object in an image with a unique label. For example, an instance segmentation model could give a unique label to each tumor.\n\nTypes of Medical Data Image Annotation\n\nBounding box: A bounding box is a rectangular region that encloses an object in an image. It is the simplest and most common type of annotation.\n\nPolygon: A polygon is a closed figure made of multiple line segments for annotating objects that have irregular shapes.\n\nKeypoints: Keypoints represent the location of specific features in an image. They are often used to annotate objects that have a small size or that are difficult to identify with a bounding box or polygon.\n\nLandmark: A landmark denotes a specific point of interest in the image, such as the nose tip or tumor center. Landmarks are primarily used for registration tasks, which involve aligning two or more images of the same object.\n\nPoint cloud: A point cloud is a collection of points that represent the 3D coordinates of an object. It is used for registration and volumetric segmentation tasks.\n\nBiggest Challenges in Medical Data Annotation\n\nPrivacy\n\nIn the medical domain, the data collected is highly personal and subject to privacy regulations. When using a cloud platform for data labeling or outsourcing the labeling process, it is crucial to ensure that the data is handled with strict privacy and security regulations.\n\niMerit addresses this by baking the medical anonymizer service directly into the platform. It means that when data is uploaded, it goes through a layer of anonymization that removes all patient and institution-specific details before a labeler sees the data.\n\nExpertise\n\nAnother challenge of medical data labeling is the need for domain expertise to label the medical data, as it is complex, and an untrained labeler may struggle to annotate it correctly. It is where the experience and qualifications of radiologists and radiographers come in.\n\niMerit ensures a rigorous recruitment process to select capable and experienced medical professionals in radiology, robotic surgery, and pathology to ensure the labels are as accurate as possible.\n\nFormats\n\nMedical imaging data comes in formats that are different from traditional image formats. These formats are more robust and suited to the needs of medical systems and professionals. However, this makes them more complex, making compatibility with different platforms an issue.\n\nThe iMerit labeling platform supports all types of DICOMs: series, single- and multi-frame, 8- and 12-bit, color/BW, 3D, and more.\n\nChoosing the Right Medical Data Image Annotation Tool\n\nDICOM viewers with annotation capabilities abound in the market. One notable open-source option, for example, is 3D Slicer.\n\nDICOM viewing tools, however, are not optimized for ML model training. Sometimes it is simply impossible to use the labels from these viewers in machine learning. This is due to a lack of instance IDs and structured export formats.\n\nYou must use a professional medical data image labeling tool to train and develop a neural network. The image annotation tool you choose will have to satisfy these requirements:\n\nDoes the solution support medical formats such as DICOM and TIFF?\n\nDoes it support the labeling tools you are looking for?\n\nIs the UX easy to use and suitable for medical use?\n\nIs the export format easy to use in ML model training?\n\nDoes the solution have a medical data labeling service to enhance your workforce?\n\n5 Key Questions to Ask Before Outsourcing Healthcare Data Labeling\n\nWhat are your privacy and security standards? Healthcare data is highly sensitive, and it is crucial that the company you outsource it to has strong privacy and security standards in place. Ask about their data encryption methods, access control policies, and disaster recovery procedures.\n\nWhat is your experience with medical data labeling? Not all companies have experience with medical data labeling. Ask about the work with labeling different types of medical images and their experience with working with healthcare organizations.\n\nWhat is your quality assurance process? Ask about their quality assurance procedures, as well as their turnaround times for quality assurance checks.\n\nWhat is the pricing? Healthcare data labeling can be expensive, so you must get quotes from multiple companies before deciding. Ask about the pricing structure and discounts they may offer for long-term contracts.\n\nWill subject matter experts be involved? SMEs are healthcare professionals with specialized knowledge in a particular area, such as radiology or pathology. SMEs can be involved in the labeling process in several ways. They can train the labelers, review the labels created, or participate in the quality assurance process. Ask about their workforce, training capabilities, and response time for customer inquiries.\n\nBy asking these questions, you can ensure that you choose a company that provides high-quality, accurate, and secure medical data labeling services.\n\nIt is always good to start partnering up with a company that has already invested the time and effort required to comply with the various data formats, regulatory requirements, and user experience needed for a successful medical AI data annotation project. iMerit is one of the leading global data annotation providers and has been rated #1 in healthcare data labeling by i360 Research, September 2022 edition.\n\nWhat Sets iMerit Apart?\n\nFully-managed Teams with Tiered Expertise to Ensure Quality\n\niMerit medical division has three tiers of expertise: a curriculum-driven workforce by clinicians and SMEs, specialized annotators for QC, and US board-certified doctors for benchmarking and validation.

Unfortunately, this complexity makes India one of the countries with the highest road accident death rates globally. Many of these accidents are linked to driver inattentiveness, fatigue, or distraction, making road safety a critical concern. According to the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways road accidents in India 2022 report, over 160,000 fatalities were recorded last year, underscoring the urgent need for Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) solutions.\n\nDid you know:\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, India accounts for 11% of global road fatalities, despite having only 1% of the world’s vehicles.\n\nDriver fatigue contributes to 10-25% of all road crashes in India, as highlighted by the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways’ draft on the Driver Drowsiness and Attention Warning System.\n\nIn Australia, fatigue-related crashes make up 20% of serious accidents, while in the U.S., it’s around 16-20%.\n\nCountries with strong road safety measures, like Sweden, report significantly lower fatality rates, with just 1.9 road deaths per 100,000 people.\n\nIn this context, Driver Monitoring Systems have emerged as a critical solution to improve road safety. As India modernizes its road safety infrastructure, widespread adoption of DMS can significantly reduce fatalities and promote safer driving habits.\n\nDMS offers a promising solution to tackle these challenges, using advanced technology to monitor driver behavior and prevent accidents before they happen.\n\nUnderstanding Driver Monitoring Systems\n\nA Driver Monitoring System (DMS) is an advanced in-vehicle safety feature that combines technologies like AI, computer vision, and sensors to monitor and analyze a driver’s behavior in real-time. By detecting signs of fatigue, drowsiness, or distractions, and analyzing facial expressions, eye activity, and head movements, the system can issue alerts or activate safety mechanisms to prevent potential accidents. Additionally, sensors track driver attentiveness, ensuring that when risks are detected, timely interventions are made to enhance overall driving safety.\n\nKey Features of a DMS:\n\nFacial recognition and eye-tracking can detect yawning, prolonged eye closure, head tilting, or whether the driver is wearing glasses or sunglasses.\n\nBehavioral analysis can determine if the driver is wearing a seatbelt, has both hands on the wheel, or is holding a phone—indicating potential distraction.\n\nEmotional analysis can assess facial expressions to detect stress, anger, frustration, fatigue, or drowsiness, determining if a driver is too impaired to drive safely and reducing the risk of accidents.\n\nOccupant detection ensures safety for everyone in the vehicle, identifying passengers (including children or pets) in both the front and back seats to trigger appropriate safety measures.\n\nGaze detection can assess whether the driver is focused on the road or distracted by the dashboard, radio, or infotainment system.\n\nReal-time alerts provide immediate warnings if risky behavior is detected, helping drivers stay aware and reducing the likelihood of accidents.\n\nHow Driver Monitoring Systems Strengthen ADAS for Safer Roads\n\nA standalone DMS is effective, but its true potential is unlocked when integrated into Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Here’s how this integration enhances overall vehicle safety:\n\nAdaptive Assistance: DMS data can be used to adjust ADAS features dynamically. For example, if the system detects driver fatigue, it can trigger lane-keeping assistance or adaptive cruise control.\n\nAutomated Warnings and Interventions: By syncing with braking and steering control systems, DMS can initiate alerts or take corrective actions if the driver is unresponsive.\n\nBehavior-based Personalization: ADAS can learn a driver’s typical behavior and adjust sensitivity levels for alerts accordingly, reducing false alarms and improving user experience.\n\nFleet and Commercial Vehicle Safety: Integrated DMS-ADAS solutions particularly benefit commercial fleets, helping monitor driver performance and reduce accident risks.\n\nAs automotive technology advances, combining DMS with ADAS will be critical in paving the way for safer roads in India and beyond. Manufacturers and developers must prioritize seamless integration to ensure both technologies work in harmony.\n\nAI and ML in Driver Monitoring Systems\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are at the core of modern DMS.. These technologies enable real-time detection of driver behavior, drowsiness, and distractions, ensuring enhanced safety on the road. Developers working on DMS solutions should focus on the following key aspects:\n\nRobust Training Data: High-quality and diverse datasets are crucial for training AI models to accurately detect driver states across different demographics, lighting conditions, and driving environments.\n\nEdge AI for Real-time Processing: Implementing AI models on edge devices reduces latency, enabling faster response times without relying on cloud processing.\n\nBias Mitigation: Developers must ensure that AI models are inclusive and free from biases related to age, gender, or ethnicity to provide accurate monitoring for all drivers.\n\nMultimodal Inputs: Combining video, infrared sensors, and physiological signals (like heart rate or eye movement) can significantly improve accuracy and reliability.\n\nRegulatory Compliance: Adhering to global and regional safety standards ensures that the system meets legal requirements and gains user trust.\n\nCurrent Adoption of DMS in India\n\nCustomer Perspective\n\nFleet operators and commercial vehicle owners are increasingly adopting DMS to minimize risks, enhance safety, and lower insurance costs. India’s ADAS market is expected to grow from USD 2.97 billion in 2025 to USD 6.89 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 18.33%, driven by rising road safety awareness and technological advancements. However, private passenger vehicle buyers remain hesitant due to the price sensitivity of the Indian market and the additional cost of incorporating DMS.\n\nCompanies and Manufacturers Leading the Way\n\nBharatBenz: Integrated Driver State Monitoring Systems into heavy-duty trucks, aiming to address fatigue-related accidents.\n\nRosmerta Technologies: Unveiled an AI-based DMS solution at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2024, indicating a growing interest in AI-powered safety technologies.\n\nEmerging Players: Automakers like Tata Motors and Mahindra are actively exploring DMS integration in vehicles tailored for Indian driving conditions.\n\nChallenges in Adopting Driver Monitoring Systems in India\n\nIndia’s bustling roads reflect its vibrant economy and growing mobility needs, but the increasing traffic density also brings challenges like frequent congestion and higher accident risks. DMS has the potential to significantly enhance road safety, but its adoption is still in its early stages. Despite its potential, widespread adoption of DMS faces several roadblocks:\n\nCost Sensitivity: The cost of integrating DMS into vehicles is a significant deterrent, especially in India’s highly price-sensitive market. Budget-conscious fleet operators and passenger vehicle owners often prioritize affordability over advanced safety features.\n\nInfrastructure Limitations: Infrastructure limitations in rural areas, including scarce maintenance services and lack of technical support, make DMS deployment challenging and reduce system efficiency. Uneven roads, potholes, and inconsistent traffic signals further hinder ADAS performance. In such conditions, DMS helps by providing real-time driver behavior data, allowing vehicle systems to adapt warnings and assist features for safer driving.\n\nPrivacy Concerns: Real-time driver monitoring, a core feature of DMS, raises valid concerns about data security and surveillance ethics. Many individuals worry about how their personal data will be used, stored, or shared, creating resistance to widespread implementation.\n\nComplex and Unstructured Traffic: Indian roads witness a mix of pedestrians, cyclists, auto-rickshaws, and vehicles moving unpredictably. Unlike structured highway systems in developed countries, lane discipline is often weak, making it harder for ADAS to function reliably. DMS can bridge this gap by ensuring driver attentiveness, issuing alerts when manual intervention is needed, and complementing ADAS decision-making in chaotic environments.\n\nTechnological Adaptation and Calibration: DMS technology, primarily developed for structured environments, requires significant adaptation for Indian driving conditions.\n\nSensor Calibration: The need for frequent calibration of sensors to adapt to the dynamic Indian road conditions poses a significant challenge. Misalignment can lead to incorrect data interpretation, reducing system reliability.\n\nLocalization of Algorithms: DMS algorithms trained on Western driving patterns need extensive retraining to recognize behaviors unique to Indian roads, such as frequent honking, weaving through traffic, and unpredictable pedestrian crossings.\n\nData Scarcity for Machine Learning:Machine learning models require diverse, high-quality datasets to improve DMS accuracy. However, the lack of annotated Indian driving data affects the system’s ability to detect fatigue, distraction, and other risk factors accurately. The effectiveness of DMS relies on extensive data for machine learning, but the scarcity of high-quality, annotated data reflecting Indian driving scenarios limits the training and refinement of these systems.\n\nWeather and Visibility Challenges: India’s monsoons, dense fog, and dust storms reduce visibility, impacting sensor accuracy in both ADAS and DMS. Poor lighting conditions and faded road markings further reduce system efficiency. DMS, however, remains effective in low visibility by continuously assessing driver alertness, ensuring they stay engaged even when external sensors face limitations.\n\nAffordability and Market Adoption: While full-fledged ADAS remains expensive, DMS offers a cost-effective way to enhance road safety by monitoring human behavior rather than relying solely on external sensors. As regulatory bodies push for stricter safety norms, DMS integration in commercial and passenger vehicles may become a necessary safety feature.\n\nRegulatory Landscape\n\nCurrently, India lacks specific regulations mandating the adoption of DMS in vehicles. However, supportive government policies could play a crucial role in overcoming the barriers to adoption. Measures such as tax benefits for vehicles equipped with advanced safety technologies, subsidies for fleet operators adopting DMS, and penalties for non-compliance with road safety norms could significantly accelerate the integration of these systems across the country.\n\nAddressing These Challenges\n\nTo drive adoption, collaboration between automakers, policymakers, and technology providers will be key. Reducing hardware costs through localized manufacturing, increasing awareness campaigns on DMS benefits, and implementing privacy-first AI models can help build trust and encourage adoption. Additionally, government incentives and stricter road safety regulations will be instrumental in making DMS a standard feature rather than an optional add-on.\n\nPotential Impact of DMS on Road Safety in India\n\nAs India moves towards smarter and safer roads, large-scale adoption of Driver Monitoring Systems can create long-term structural improvements in road safety and traffic management.\n\nScaling Road Safety Nationwide: Unlike individual accident prevention, nationwide DMS adoption—especially in fleets, public transport, and ride-hailing services—can systematically lower fatigue-related and distraction-induced crashes, reducing the country’s high road fatality rate.\n\nPolicy-Driven Road Safety Improvements: Aggregated DMS data can help governments and regulatory bodies analyze accident hotspots, assess road risk factors, and develop data-backed traffic laws that improve infrastructure planning and enforcement.\n\nEnabling Smarter Transport Ecosystems: DMS is foundational in integrating India’s transition to connected and autonomous vehicles (ADAS) by providing real-time driver behavior data that enhances semi-autonomous driving safety.\n\nLong-Term Cultural Shift in Driving Behavior: Continuous DMS monitoring can contribute to nationwide improvements in road discipline, encouraging safer habits through incentive-based compliance programs and corporate safety initiatives in commercial fleets.\n\nThe Future of DMS in India\n\nAI-Powered Customization: Future advancements in AI are paving the way for DMS solutions tailored to India’s unique driving conditions. These systems can be optimized to detect and address driving behaviors specific to chaotic and mixed-traffic environments, making them more effective in preventing accidents.\n\nSmart City Integration: With India increasingly focusing on smart city initiatives, integrating DMS into the broader urban mobility framework can enhance road safety. This includes connecting DMS with traffic management systems, enabling real-time alerts, and coordinated responses to risky driving behaviors.\n\nPolicy Support: Proactive government initiatives, such as tax incentives for vehicles equipped with DMS or subsidies for fleet operators adopting the technology, can encourage adoption. Mandating DMS for commercial vehicles, public transportation, and logistics fleets can also create a safer driving ecosystem.\n\nCollaborations: Partnerships between automakers, startups, and technology providers are vital for creating cost-effective DMS solutions.

      "# [Radha Basu: AI, iMerit, and the Power of Youth by Vitaly Zakalskiy (LBS MiM 2024) on 2024-05-08](https://wheelerblog.london.edu/radha-basu-ai-imerit-youth/)\nThe 2024 LBS Social Impact Club Conference concluded with a keynote on leveraging technology for social impact. Radha Basu (Founder and CEO of iMerit and co-founder of Anudip Foundation) shared her journey as a pioneer in the Indian software industry and a tech entrepreneur dedicated to addressing youth unemployment.\n\nThrough iMerit and Anudip, Radha has employed and upskilled hundreds of marginalised women and youth in digital services. Before her work with these foundations, she led SupportSoft (now Support.com) as Chairman & CEO and spent two decades at Hewlett Packard, where she founded HP’s India operations. Radha has also served on the boards of NetHope, Jhumki Basu Foundation, and Santa Clara CSTS.\n\nThe conversation was moderated by Rajesh Chandy (Professor of Marketing and the Tony and Maureen Wheeler Chair in Entrepreneurship at London Business School, and Co-Academic Director of the Wheeler Institute).\n\niMerit’s Mission and Inclusivity\n\nThe discussion started off with Radha providing an overview of iMerit’s mission. As an AI technology company, it focuses on AI solutions and products. iMerit specialises in data annotation and labelling to train AI models for clients. These models, essential for AI development, rely on annotated data to function effectively. iMerit’s projects include autonomous technologies, medical AI for surgical robots, and social media analytics for issues like suicide prevention. The company handles edge cases, simulations, and test scenarios to ensure model reliability. Radha highlighted iMerit’s competitive edge, partially stemming from its focus on client success and business growth. This focus was reflected in the company’s high net revenue retention, implying strong client relationships.\n\nAnother important achievement mentioned by Radha was the 50-50 gender split among the employees at iMerit which includes young people from low-income and underrepresented communities, extending opportunities beyond established tech hubs. The company operates in areas like Shillong, Bhuvaneshwar, and Calcutta, focusing on critical job creation regions.\n\nEngaging with the Next Generation of Employees\n\nRadha described her collaborative and approachable communication style with younger employees at iMerit, where the average age is 24.6 years. Despite being the CEO and founder, Radha is affectionately called “Dee,” meaning older sister. Young employees are confident and often challenge her decisions. For instance, they might recall a time when Radha doubted a complex project, only to see it succeed later. This dynamic keeps her energised and fulfilled, as the employees’ persistence and enthusiasm drive the company’s success.\n\nRadha’s Personal Journey\n\nMoving on to Radha’s personal journey, she talked about her decision to pursue engineering the strict traditional environment. She recounted a clear gender imbalance during her university years, being one of only 17 girls among 2,700 boys in her engineering university.\n\nJoining HP’s R&D lab marked the beginning of her successful career. Radha credited HP for honing her business skills, understanding financials, and blending technology with community impact. During her years at HP, Radha had a transformative moment that connected her past experiences to her current work. She described how these experiences shaped her approach to technology, entrepreneurship, and impact. Radha’s journey illustrates the blend of perseverance, learning, and seizing opportunities, ultimately leading her to create meaningful social impact through iMerit.\n\nFrom HP to Support.com and Beyond\n\nAfter 20 years at HP, Radha joined Support.com in 2000 as a CEO, just before the dot-com bust. Despite the timing, the company thrived, and she gained valuable experience. This led her to establish a non-profit called Anudip Foundation focused on training young people from marginalised backgrounds. Over 15 years, the organisation upskilled over 500,000 people, with 75% securing jobs and over 50% being women.\n\nRadha’s vision extended to digital skills and AI. She initiated training in computer vision and AI, targeting large clients and skilling individuals in advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles and 3D mapping. Her focus on high standards and selective investors ensured the company’s growth and success. One of iMerit’s centres became a global hub of excellence in computer vision, celebrating a decade of impactful work.\n\nAligning Social Impact with Profitability\n\nThe importance of aligning social impact with business goals was discussed as well. Indeed, Radha maintained that companies seek solutions, high-quality technology, and profitability. While they may appreciate noble causes, their primary concern is business success. To maintain competitiveness, expertise, technology, and adaptability are crucial, especially with the rapid evolution of AI.\n\nThe establishment of iMerit’s training academy became a business differentiator, reducing retraining costs and fostering a consistent, skilled workforce. Radha reiterated the importance of believing in young people’s potential, taking risks, and embracing change. Rajesh acknowledged how Radha’s experiences at HP and the emergence of Bangalore as a tech centre influenced her. He noted that such transformations could happen in other cities, highlighting the potential for new tech hubs to emerge globally.\n\nRegulation of AI\n\nWhen asked about the dialogue between the business community and policymakers regarding AI regulation, Radha underscored the importance of responsible AI. She noted that AI models are trained by examples, making it essential to consider who provides these examples and how they shape AI.\n\nRadha advocated for a collaborative approach to regulation, involving AI experts from technology and enterprise sectors working with government officials. While monitoring and security are important, she argued that regulations should not stifle innovation. There’s an ongoing debate about pausing AI development until proper regulations are in place. However, it was pointed out that young innovators are unlikely to wait for older generations to catch up. They will continue to develop and push boundaries, which is essential for progress.\n\nAdapting to Generative AI: Workforce Challenges and Solutions\n\nIMerit has come a long way, adapting to the challenges posed by the rise of generative AI and automation. Radha explained that while iMerit initially focused on annotation and labelling, achieving high-quality results through extensive training and skilling academies, generative AI has introduced new complexities requiring different skills.\n\nAccording to Radha, comprehension, communication, and confidence, are essential for prompt engineering and response, where employees must interact effectively with AI models. To tackle this, iMerit prioritises training in logical reasoning, judgment, and critical thinking, alongside advanced English skills. iMerit invested in retraining programs, allowing employees to take some time off from projects to build their skills and prepare better for future challenges.\n\nInnovative Solutions Amid the COVID-19 Crisis\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic started, iMerit faced a true existential crisis, as it was forced to close its centres overnight. Yet those centres were not only workplaces but also social hubs for employees. With 300 employees suddenly at home, many in remote areas without broadband, maintaining operations seemed daunting.\n\nDemonstrating its adaptability, iMerit worked with broadband providers to extend last-mile connectivity to employees’ homes. They initiated “combat coding,” where employees were equipped with the necessary tools and support. Remarkably, employees travelled up to 50 kilometres on motorbikes to deliver and install equipment.\n\nRadha shared inspiring stories of resilience: women carrying desktops home, pregnant employees balancing work and family, and innovative setups like using kitchen spaces or rooftops for better connectivity. One particularly memorable image was of an employee working under an umbrella on her roof to get a better signal. This spirit of innovation and dedication allowed iMerit to continue operations. Within five weeks, they resumed work community by community, project by project. The company’s culture of responsibility and problem-solving was crucial. Employees supported each other, ensuring projects stayed on track.\n\nAbout the speakers\n\nRadha Ramaswami Basu is the founder and CEO of iMerit, a global AI data solutions company delivering high-quality data that powers machine learning and artificial intelligence applications for Fortune 500 companies. Under Radha’s leadership, iMerit employs an inclusive workforce of more than 5500 people worldwide, with 80% from underserved communities and 54% are women. Radha led iMerit through two funding rounds, raising $23.5 million to date from investors and led the company to reach new revenue heights. Previously, Radha was the SupportSoft Chairwoman and CEO. She spent 20 years at Hewlett Packard, where she grew HP’s electronic software division into a $1.2 billion business and launched HP in India. Radha has received accolades including the Global Thinkers Forum Award, UN Women-ITU Gender-Equality Mainstreaming Technology Award, Silicon Valley Business Journal Women of Influence Award, Top 25 Women of the Web and CEO of the Year. She serves on the boards of NetHope, Jhumki Basu Foundation and the Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship. Radha founded the SCU’s Frugal Innovation Hub and co-founded the Anudip Foundation.\n\nRajesh Chandy is Professor of Marketing and the Tony and Maureen Wheeler Chair in Entrepreneurship at London Business School, where he is also the Academic Director of the Wheeler Institute for Business and Development. Rajesh’s current research lies at the intersection of business and development. His recent projects have covered the impact of business skills among micro-entrepreneurs in South Africa, novel financing approaches in Ghana, property rights in slums in Egypt, innovation among farmers in India, highways and private education expenditures in India, and using big data for development outcomes.\n\nChandy is a member of the advisory board of the Journal of Marketing and a Co-Editor of the journal’s special issue on “Better Marketing for a Better World”.

      "# [AI is playing a big role in creating jobs in my company, says veteran Silicon Valley tech leader Radha Basu by Ishani Duttagupta on 2025-03-02](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ai-is-playing-a-big-role-in-creating-jobs-in-my-company-says-veteran-silicon-valley-tech-leader-radha-basu/articleshow/118659698.cms)\nPhoto/TNN\n\nTransitions have been an intrinsic part of Radha Ramaswami Basu ’s career. From two decades at Hewlett Packard, where she launched the company in India and as senior general manager of the electronic software division, helped it grow into a $1.2 billion business, to chairperson & CEO of SupportSoft , a Silicon Valley technology start-up, which she led through initial and secondary public offerings on Nasdaq; and now founder and CEO of iMerit Technology, a data solutions company that powers machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, while making a social and economic impact with an inclusive workforce of marginalised youth and women; she has consistently taken on leadership roles in driving technological advancements. She is also co-founder, with her husband, of Anudip Foundation – a sister foundation of iMerit.\n\n“I don’t see the non-profit sector as a big transition. If you want to scale it, you have to run it like a business – it is a not-for-profit business. You must strategise, bringing in business principles, approaches, planning, and execution. I took my business learnings to the foundation and the social enterprise,” Basu told the Times of India in an exclusive interview at the Indiaspora Forum for Good, in Abu Dhabi, earlier this week.\n\nPeople call us an AI technology company, which it is, Basu said about iMerit. “It has an inclusive workforce. I think of it as a journey, with AI playing a huge role in creating jobs. Our foundation has helped create over 500,000 jobs and helped young people develop and become a part of the global workforce,” she said. When people voice fears about AI taking away jobs, Basu points out that iMerit is creating jobs in AI by skilling people to take them to the forefront of the global workforce. “We are a technology company and a products company and we also work for inclusion and we work with AI for societal applications,” she said adding that iMerit also has marquee investors such as Khosla Impact, British International Investment, Omidyar Network and Michael & Susan Dell Foundation; big names from the technology sector. “For me, using technology for social benefit is at the core of what we do,” she said.\n\nBasu, who spends time between India and the US, believes in working with the governments in both the countries to leverage the impact of her ventures. “I moved to the US from India 50 years ago and now I primarily spend my time between my two homes. I am not political in India or the US, but I think it is increasingly important to work with the government in the area of AI. Some examples are skilling and job creation, healthcare, agriculture - when you work with government, the impact is magnified. Over the years, I have become more knowledgeable and interested in learning from others who are like-minded and working with the government in areas where technology has broad societal applications,” says Basu. She feels that there are many companies, including iMerit, that are working with responsible and impactful AI.\n\nBasu, who is recognised as one of the most successful Indian American women entrepreneurs and mentors, acknowledges that there was a glass ceiling that she faced when she first went to the US. “My engineering college in Chennai had 2800 boys and 17 girls. When I went to the US for a master’s degree, I didn’t know a single person there and in those days the government of India allowed us only $8 foreign exchange to carry with us. But it was part of my learning to use the resources that I had and to grow. Through that I developed resilience, grit and the ability to laugh at myself,” she said. Her motto is: you go through slips and mistakes; pick yourself up, dust off and move on. “The glass ceiling is there – you have to kick it hard; your foot might hurt a bit but the glass will be shattered and you will recover,” she said.\n\nShe also accepts that it is challenging for women in top corporate roles to juggle between a full-time job and responsibilities at home. “When you’re with a client your full attention has to be there, but when your child is sick at home, that needs your entire attention too. Juggling different roles is a quality that women have,” Basu said. Her advice to successful women is to share their narratives and learn self-confidence, grit and resilience from each other. “We should be able to take advice from one another. And I always believe that I should look at every situation and if I can make a difference, I need to go for it; but if it’s something that I cannot change, I need the serenity and wisdom to accept that,” she said.\n\niMentor has operations across India with 4000 employees working with AI, so she needs to travel back and forth between Silicon Valley, where she has lived for 30 years, and India, often. “With the Indian government having imposed the rule of only 120 days in India per visit, I have to plan my trips very carefully. We have recently set up an automotive AI centre in Coimbatore and I have to spend time there, while our clients are in the US, so I travel back and forth,” she said. But she also feels that she is fortunate living in an age where it is not difficult to travel often between India and the US. “Being part of the Indian diaspora allows us to be part of both cultures. I love my Tamil and Indian heritage. My husband is from Bengal, which is also a state with rich culture. We work with people all over India; in Silicon Valley, we are connected to the diaspora. We are fortunate to be exposed to all this,” she said. Basu sees herself as an optimist and part of a brigade that believes in ‘fixing it’ if there’s a problem instead of complaining. “We are fortunate to make the best of what we have and fight the things that are not good.”\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA",

This gave the State a unique advantage over other cities where local employees were in the minority. However, the State faced challenges in accommodating its local talent, with many individuals seeking job opportunities outside Tamil Nadu.\n\nAs global companies move away from China, India, particularly Tamil Nadu, stands to benefit from its younger population, he said.\n\nMr. Thiaga Rajan also mentioned that there was a growing demand for office space that had led to a supply-demand mismatch, with available spaces being quickly taken over by multiple companies. To address this, the Tamil Nadu government had decided to develop a 3-million-square-foot office space in the existing three Special Economic Zones (SEZ), through a joint venture with ELCOT and other companies.\n\nThe government was also reallocating unused land under ELCOT and SIPCOT for development, with construction under way in several projects and efforts were being made to strengthen links between Tamil Nadu and international companies to drive further growth in the IT sector, he said.\n\nRegarding AI, Mr. Thiagarajan said that while it was a rapidly growing sector, AI cannot replace humans as it depended on human input for data. Job opportunities in IT and AI were expected to increase for at least the next decade as the technology continued to evolve.",
      "# [Celebrating women: trailblazing inclusion in tech](https://www.ey.com/en_in/media/podcasts/celebrating-remarkable-women/2024/06/episode-5-celebrating-remarkable-women-trailblazing-inclusion-in-tech)\nSonu Iyer: Welcome to another episode of EY India Insights podcast series celebrating exceptional women. I am Sonu Iyer, Partner and Executive Sponsor of Diversity Equity Inclusiveness at EY India. It is my privilege to host Radha Basu, founder and CEO of I-Merit, a global, technology-led, gender-diverse AI solutions company.\n\nI-Merit is a leader in data enrichment and annotation services. We will learn more about I-Merit as we speak with Radha. Prior to I-Merit, Radha successfully grew Hewlett Packard Electronics Software division into a $1.2 billion business in India. She is also the chairman and CEO of support.com, which she took public with an IPO on the NASDAQ. A truly remarkable woman featured in our podcast series today.\n\nApart from her corporate achievements, Radha is known for her advocacy for diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. She is a strong supporter of gender equality and has actively backed initiatives to enhance the presence of women in tech.\n\nRadha and her husband co-founded the Anudip Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to providing IT training and job opportunities for disadvantaged youth and women. Tune in to hear Radha's inspiring journey of innovation, inclusion, and impact.\n\nRadha, welcome to EY India Insights podcast series.\n\nRadha Ramaswamy Basu: Thank you, Sonu. So delighted to be speaking with you.\n\nSonu Iyer: okay, let us get started.\n\nRadha, please share with our listeners what really sparked the idea of I-Merit and how have you seen this impact unfold in the tech industry?\n\nRadha Ramaswamy Basu: Yes, let me go back several years. There was a time, which most people today do not realize when there was no IT industry in India. In the late 1980s, nobody believed that IT could thrive in India. However, the IT industry sparked an economic revolution in India, transforming the country.\n\nI was very involved in this transformation, Sonu, because I started Hewlett Packard in India. HP was one of the first international tech companies to set up a software center in Bangalore in the late 1980s, a then sleepy town. This revolution created a thriving middle class and positively impacted many young people in metropolitan areas. However, it also left behind many young people from underserved and under-resourced backgrounds, particularly young women and youth.\n\nWe examined how to bring wealth creation to these hundreds of millions of young people. We conducted a comprehensive study on the potential of digital jobs for young people from these backgrounds. This was the genesis of the Anudip Foundation. At that time, I had taken a company public on Nasdaq and sold its enterprise software division. My husband, who was at Cisco, and I decided to pursue this initiative.\n\nLater, I had the opportunity to work with Peter, a BTR founder of eBay, and discussed the future of work with him. This conversation inspired us to demonstrate how digital jobs could transform the lives of young people from under-resourced backgrounds. This led to the creation of I-Merit, a unique for-profit technology enterprise focused on entrepreneurship and social impact. We were fortunate to be at the forefront of the AI revolution as it began to unfold, which helped shape I-Merit.\n\nWe started with 38 people ten years ago and recently celebrated our 10th anniversary. The creation of I-Merit was driven by the goal of building a global technology company with an inclusive workforce. This is the fundamental belief and DNA of I-Merit and how to bring more people into the workforce and trust in the potential of these young individuals.\n\nSonu Iyer: Yes, and it is a great story. I was just thinking, as you were talking about how decades ago, Bangalore was a sleepy town. It is no longer sleepy, especially with you being at the cusp of the AI revolution. The creation of a unique entrepreneurial venture that is both for profit and impactful, while also being conscious of its social purpose and mission, is truly remarkable.\n\nMany congratulations to you and your husband for your thinking through this.\n\nRadha Ramaswamy Basu: Thank you, Sonu.\n\nSonu Iyer: Radha, I did my research on I-Merit in preparation for this podcast. What stands out to me about I-Merit is how inclusive the organization is. Almost 80% of employees come from marginalized backgrounds, and 52% of the workforce is women. You've clearly got your approach right, with some mantra, strategy, or perhaps multiple strategies that you employed to achieve your current success at I-Merit. Could you share some of the strategies you used to build such a successful business while staying true to the vision, mission, and purpose of the organization?\n\nRadha Ramaswamy Basu: Yes, this has been our approach from the beginning. If you speak with people about I-Merit, you’ll hear that it is a company of very young individuals. The average age is 24.8, which might be surprising given my appearance. But it is true—24.8. When asked about the guiding principle at the core of I-Merit, we don’t talk in those terms. Instead, we follow a mantra: having two feet firmly planted on the ground. One foot represents a maniacal focus on clients and building the business, aiming for global competitiveness in AI. The other foot is equally important, symbolizing the creation of a global business with an inclusive workforce tied together through strong investments in technology, platforms, and products. This philosophy is the essence of I-Merit from day one.\n\nWe don’t question how to achieve diversity and inclusion; it is ingrained in the company’s DNA and is a daily decision. Just as you wouldn’t question which leg is more important, business success drives inclusion, and an inclusive workforce drives business success. This approach is reflected in our retention rates—92% overall, and even higher among women—exceptional in the technology sector, especially considering the challenges of the Great Resignation and Covid.\n\nAdditionally, we aim for an inclusive employee base that participates in the company’s equity. When I founded the company, we allocated 26% of my equity into a trust for the inclusive employee base, many of whom had never had equity participation before. During our B round, we did a small secondary sale, and the first part of that sale went into the trust, where shares were exchanged for cash, recognizing and reinforcing the value of inclusion.\n\nAt I-Merit, there is a culture of equality and mutual respect, devoid of hierarchy. Employees address me as \"Di,\" which means older sister in Tamil, showing a familial respect rather than a hierarchical one. I’ll share a touching anecdote: A young lady, who advanced to team lead in autonomous vehicles and LIDAR work, sent me a G-chat from the delivery room after having her baby. She said, \"Di, here is a picture of my precious baby. You and my mother are the first to see this.\" This gesture deeply moved me, not because it is part of our culture to do such things, but because it exemplifies the respect and equality we foster, valuing people for their abilities rather than their pedigrees and degrees.\n\nThis connection with our people is the most precious aspect of our culture.\n\nSonu Iyer: Thank you, Radha, for the wonderful tips for those interested. The importance of reward, recognition, and making employees part of your equity base, along with fostering a culture of mutual respect and a lack of hierarchy, are key points. The story and anecdote you shared clearly exemplify the culture of your organization. You are truly walking the talk, embodying the role of Akka or Di, as we say in India. Very impressive.\n\nRadha, I want to know more about the 52% of your workforce being women, which is quite unusual. You also mentioned that the attrition rate for women in your organization is less than 10%. What initiatives are you implementing to drive innovation and growth specifically for women in I-Merit, particularly in tech-related roles? Could you share some specific initiatives that have helped women in I-Merit thrive, succeed, and stay with the organization?\n\nRadha Ramaswamy Basu: Sure. If you're okay with it, let me start by giving a broader context of our inclusive workforce, and then I'll focus on women. Our mission and growth pathway are integral to this discussion. We have just over 5,000 employees globally, whom we call I-Meriters, with ten centers worldwide: eight in India, one in Bhutan, and one in New Orleans, USA, with plans for another center in the US, likely Pittsburgh. Notably, 52% of our workforce is women, and around 70%—sometimes as high as 80%—are from tier two or three towns in India and the US. This creates a workforce that is authentic, grounded, inclusive, and eager to learn.\n\nPeople often ask how we achieve a 50-50 gender balance in tech. My answer is simple: the world is 50-50, so why shouldn’t the tech industry reflect that? Inclusivity is not just a concept for us; it is fundamental to crafting responsible AI solutions that address global challenges.\n\nLet me share an example of our work with women. We have an all-women center in Metiabruz, eastern India, about two hours from Calcutta. Initially, we partnered with Anudip to provide young women with skills to secure jobs without leaving their community. This began about ten years ago. We brought digital jobs to them, found them eager to learn, and exceptionally capable. With training from Microsoft, they excelled in computer vision and became a certified global center of excellence, working on advanced projects like multi-sensor fusion, 3D LiDAR, and surgical robots.\n\nWorking within the community was crucial. We created a safe, acceptable workplace for women, which was essential for their participation. An anecdote: as our female employees naturally grew , many stayed with us for eight to nine years. On our 10th anniversary, we recognized 142 out of 175 original employees, over 60% of whom were women. Many have since married and had children. In India, it is often difficult for married women to return to full-time jobs, especially in empowered roles where they earn 5-15 times their family income.\n\nTo support them, we introduced flexible work arrangements, including working from home. One popular initiative was \"mother-in-law day,\" where employees could bring their mothers-in-law to work, strengthening family support. We also extended maternity leave up to six months. Remarkably, most women returned to work within two months.\n\nDuring COVID, we ensured consistent pay and provided broadband connections to remote communities. We trained women to set up workstations and manage flexible hours, often working near their kitchens. Our continuous upskilling initiatives, like the GenAI Academy, are central to our mission, providing long-term career development.\n\nThe impact is profound. Women at I-Merit often say, \"I have a voice.\" This empowerment transforms their lives, families, and communities, integrating them into a global workforce. I got very passionate and made it a very long answer, so please bear with me.\n\nSonu Iyer: I love the passion, and I am completely aligned with it. I have a voice, and it is so simple yet so powerful. Thank you for discussing Mother-in-Law Day and how empowering it is for both mothers and mothers-in-law who support women to stay on course in their careers.\n\nThese are great stories, and I hope this message comes through loud and clear. I know we've been kind of drumming the tables and talking about the fact that demographically, 50% of the world's population is women, yet we are nowhere close to seeing that reflected in our workplaces. And the statistic that always gets my blood pressure going is the one that the World Economic Forum puts out about the number of years it will take for the gender gap to close. In the latest report, the 2023 World Economic Forum, if I recall correctly, said it would take 131 years for the gender gap to close if we continue at this pace.\n\nRadha Ramaswamy Basu: So that is it. We cannot continue to do it in this space. Right, Sonu? Absolutely. You're right.\n\nSonu Iyer: And it is entrepreneurs like you are the ones making the difference, and thank you for that.\n\nRadha Ramaswamy Basu: I tell you, it is the women. It is all our people in the company who are making the difference. If you see how sassy and on top of things they are, continuously learning? I'll tell you another thing. So yes, they put out statistics and things, and I'm a big fighter of this. I'm a fighter to say that we cannot talk about needing even.\n\nAnd I'm sorry to say this because I know your role, but even saying that we need a diversity office, so we need to focus on equity. I believe companies should be designed to be 50-50, to be inclusive because that is the best way. If we did not do that, you would not get cell phones out to everybody, everywhere. It is ubiquitous, right?\n\nPeople and AI to be ubiquitous and the only way AI is going to be ubiquitous is if we have AI applications that are in societal applications. If the people working in AI are equal, there is gender equity and there are young people from all kinds of backgrounds. So it is got to be the people who are working in it, the people it impacts, and the applications that impact all of these things make for inclusive and responsible AI, and that is how AI is going to become ubiquitous. And so to me, that makes the best business sense. And sometimes, like if you can have retention at 92% and 90%, and that is one of the things that every tech CEO talks about, how do I retain my people? Well, this is one of the ways.\n\nSonu Iyer: Radha, I think you would be reading my mind, if it is possible, sitting such a long distance away. But I was going to kind of get into AI. So this is a nice segway. You have already started to talk about artificial intelligence. So my question is as a trendsetter, as someone who saw it coming many years ago. So how do you see AI shaping up or the whole machine learning, shaping the landscape away from a particular focus that you have on employability of youth?\n\nBecause every time people have spoken about AI, they've talked about disruption and people losing jobs. So how is that going to change that whole employability landscape and any other, trends in the tech industry that you want to share? I'd love to hear that.\n\nRadha Ramaswamy Basu: I believe this question is very important, not just a simple query. It is a strategy that requires attention, particularly regarding how machine learning and AI are shaping our landscape. Firstly, the applications of AI span all segments of society, from farms to space exploration, from border security to healthcare, from land rights to climate change mitigation. In terms of job creation, especially in the early stages of AI technology adoption, it is just the beginning, despite the hype surrounding it, especially with GenAI; corporate and enterprise AI are still in their infancy.\n\nAI use cases are ubiquitous across various sectors. For instance, in precision agriculture, we collaborate with clients at the forefront, employing sensors and algorithms to detect crop diseases in small areas before they spread, thereby enhancing food security.\n\nThis highlights the importance of acquiring 21st-century skill sets such as critical thinking, curiosity, logical reasoning, and domain specialization. Those capable of translating domain problems into AI solutions will thrive. AI learning is different from traditional coding; it involves machines learning by example, emphasizing the fusion of robotic and human intelligence.c\n\nIndeed, AI is transforming jobs, eliminating some while creating new ones. Prompt engineering, where individuals prompt and provide feedback to intelligent systems, is crucial for reinforcement learning. The future of AI jobs lies in a trifecta of technology, talent, and technique, with human feedback being transformative.\n\nThese new AI jobs are not limited to elite institutions; they are open to a diverse pool of individuals who can be trained in AI skills. In India, this extends beyond metropolitan areas to embrace generalists from various backgrounds capable of navigating complex technological intersections.\n\nOur GenAI Academy has trained over 1200 individuals, creating a diverse workforce of generalists, analysts, specialists, and experts. The potential of AI to create jobs in India is exciting, particularly with domain specialization and personalized applications. However, it requires significant effort in terms of upskilling and creating an inclusive workforce.\n\nDuring the pandemic, we created over 2000 jobs, underscoring the potential of AI in job creation. I am incredibly excited about the possibilities.\n\nSonu Iyer: Wow, very, very inspirational. And I think maybe a lot of rethinking for the people who think that this is just a disruptor. I think the promise of opportunity seems much larger. And of course, people have to reskill and upskill and do the right thing to leverage the opportunity AI is going to create or is already creating.\n\nRadha, I know, I'm conscious of time. I have you for some time, maybe a couple more questions?\n\nRadha Ramaswamy Basu: Yeah, sure. I wanted to say one more thing. Sonu, I attended the Stanford AI Conclave about two weeks ago, and it was just really interesting to listen to. There were venture capitalists, of course, as well as tech company CEOs and CFOs. It was more of an enclave than a huge conference; it had a very nice dialog. There were many panels discussing AI in healthcare, the inclusivity of AI in healthcare, and how it can be used for different purposes. As we listened to practitioners, technologists, services companies, venture capitalists, and professors, it really came together in my mind that AI can create a lot of jobs, but inclusivity is also about AI in inclusive and societal applications. I think that is where responsible AI is exciting for India.\n\nSonu Iyer: Thank you, Radha. If you look back on your journey, what are you most proud of? I can think of hundreds of things, even based on this interaction, that I would be proud of you for. But when you think of your career journey and your life as such, what is it that makes you most proud?\n\nRadha Ramaswamy Basu: Oh my gosh, what a question. What I am most proud of? Oh good grief. I got my masters and , I did engineer in Chennai. I came to the US to do my masters, all by myself. I did not know a single soul in the U.S and after that I joined HP labs and at that time, David Packard, David Packard and Bill Hewlett actually created Silicon Valley. Right?\n\nAnd David Packard was still roaming the halls management side, wandering around, if you remember that, and he was the CEO and, I had I was going through a leadership, they, they put me to a leadership program and they said, well, you can pick whoever you or you want to have been your leadership leader, mentor.\n\nAnd I think sometimes when you don't know how crazy you what you're asking for, it, and some of our young people are like that. I walked into David Packard's office. It was, open offices, and I said, David, I've been asked to do this, and I know you're very busy, but would you be my leadership mentor?\n\nAnd he looked at me and he is like, he is at least a foot taller than me. He stood up and he said, I've never had anybody ask me this. And you just wandered in here and you asked me this. Great. I will be your mentor and had reason. I'm bringing this up is in his last general manager's meeting.\n\nDavid was clearing then, he was really slow. It was wonderful. I happened to be sitting next to him at lunch, and he was asked - David was whatever, 80 something. He had retired. So, David, what is the most what is the proudest moment in your illustrious career? And he looked up and he said, proudest moment. You think it is all behind me?\n\nI've still mountains to climb in front of me. I'll never forget that. And so when you asked me which you. What are you most proud of? I don't know if I can answer it that way, but I can say this what I believe in and proud of. I believe in always giving 100% to whatever I'm involved in and never accepting no for an answer, especially if something has not been done before.\n\nThat is one of the most exciting big that I'm not. Well, let us go do it. And seeing the effect of these efforts on so many young people, I tell you that it is, I don't think it is the proudest moment, but it definitely is at being at that 10th anniversary and seeing all of these people in all these different centers.\n\nThis a global that is what technology does, was a global celebration in all these countries as well. And it really is just feeling that whatever it is I'm doing, give it to you 100%. And I was even asked this, somebody reminded me of that tie that the TiEcon biggest entrepreneurship conference. Just last week, I was sitting at a table when one lady who is a VC, well-known VC, came up to me and said, you wouldn't remember me. You may not, but in 2004, you gave a talk at her company was then Intel. She said that and we asked you the question about what is the magic of, you know, how do you, how do you work and how do you balance work and home? And you said every morning, every step I take, the balance has to be thought through.\n\nAnd sometimes it is the most important time for my child and sometimes for, it is the most important thing for it is you are doing something for client and you have to balance it. And she said that really stuck with me forever. And I'm sharing that because when I come across young people, she is a very successful, VC now, I've been come across people who you've had, a relationship with and you see them blossoming. Oh my gosh, it is the most wonderful feeling.\n\nSonu Iyer: Thank you so much for Radha sharing that. Finally, based on your life, work experience, impactful personality, and interactions, what is that one piece of wisdom you would like to pass on to the next generation of social entrepreneurs?\n\nRadha Ramaswamy Basu: Oh, Sonu, the questions you ask?\n\nSonu Iyer: So I promise this is the last one\n\nRadha Ramaswamy Basu: No, that is not what I'm laughing at. Wisdom, crowds, and things like that aren't really my style. I believe we tend to think of it differently. Okay, I talked about giving 100%, never expecting nothing. And I think I would like to say to entrepreneurs, the companies of the future, the real companies, the long-term, sustainable, high-growth global companies of the future will combine technology, innovation, and impact.\n\nThese three will go together in everything we do. Whether the impact is through an inclusive workforce, societal applications, or ensuring all your technologies contribute to reducing carbon footprints. If you design for zero carbon footprints, it could be a variety of different things. But when you think of technology and building unicorns, the technology, the innovation, and the societal applications of it, to me, in the future, a unicorn, which, by the way, is not something that I don't think of unicorns as one-horned animals, but to me, it is about how can you have the most massive impact, along with having both feet planted firmly and, along with great business strength and growth.\n\nSo, I would say, design business success with societal impact from the beginning of a company, then I think all our technologies will be ubiquitous. We will create jobs and be very successful in building very successful long-term companies.\n\nSonu Iyer: Thank you. Radha, that was really great. I loved the time together. And for the listeners, I think that was very impressive, very passionate, super impactful, bold, and brave. And I can say that because I'm seeing her, the very beautiful Radha Basu, and I'm sure many, many people will be inspired by this conversation.\n\nAnd as you progress through your career journey, you have ignited many sparks and kindled many careers, and many women have blossomed under your guidance and inspiration. And I am at a loss for words. What a personality! Thank you so much for making the time to be a part of this podcast, and I'm sure we'll meet again.\n\nRadha Ramaswamy Basu: Thank you, and I look forward to meeting you in person to discuss technology. I hope to meet you in person sometime soon.\n\nSonu Iyer: And that is a wrap on yet another episode of EY India Insights podcast special series celebrating remarkable women. Hope you enjoyed the episode today. Stay tuned for more conversations that inspire. Thank you.",

He has obtained more than a million dollars in grants to integrate manuscripts, texts, lexical resources, and linguistic software. In projects that produce a new paradigm of access to primary cultural materials of India, he catalogued and digitized Sanskrit manuscripts at Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard University, aligned manuscripts with corresponding digital text allowing focused access to sought passages in the manuscript images, and developed image-text alignment software to automate the process. He digitized some forty-five Sanskrit lexical sources and integrated them to allow simultaneous lookup. These lexical sources include not only the major bilingual dictionaries, but also indigenous thesauri, lists, specialized dictionaries, and monolingual Sanskrit dictionaries usually neglected by the scholarly community. In view of the success of these projects, he was awarded a prestigious International Blaise Pascal Research Chair in Paris for a year where he brought Indian theories of semantics and syntax face to face with modern computational linguistics and directed a project to build a tagged corpus of Sanskrit texts. The year culminated in an edited volume of papers on Sanskrit syntax published in 2015.\n\nHe is now developing a computational implementation of Pāṇinian grammar based on an XML formalization of the entire Aṣṭādhyāyī he completed in 2016, and is investigating the use of Pāṇinian models of verbal cognition in computational syntax. In this vein, he is translating and elucidating the early 17th century cognitive linguist Kauṇḍabhaṭṭa’s treatises on the conclusions of the Pāṇinian tradition.\n\nDr. Geetha Murali is the chief executive officer (CEO) of Room to Read, a leading international education organization that believes World Change Starts with Educated Children.® Room to Read transforms the lives of millions of children through education, creating a world free from illiteracy and gender inequality.

The idea that the artist is a sort of cartographer, a storyteller charting the visual lexicons of their time for the next generation, is a core theme of Husain’s work. Using film, photography, painting, sculpture, installation and poetry - in various combinations or on their own - Husain creates visually textured works that both reference his roots in a traditional Indian figurative style and embody his constant pursuit to evolve and contemporize that iconography.\n\nHusain’s work explores identity, iconography and urban mythology and it’s evolution from one generation to the next, illustrating his relationship with and abstraction of a more traditional Indian aesthetic. Whimsical references can be seen in his series To Speak is to Disappear, 2009, a set of delicate ink drawings on handmade Khadi paper of figures trying to communicate and connect to each other to no avail. In the painting, Sympathy vs. Empathy, 2014, a young boy and a Bengal tiger confront each other face to face, the boy appropriates the identity of the tiger with a mask while the tiger’s own face is hidden from the viewer. More complex and abstract are Husain’s Heart of Silence, 2015, a multi-media installation comprised of video, large suspended paper houses, light and reflection, and My Body, A Fleet of Ships, 2014, in which acrylic panels densely layered with photographic images and paintings surround fragments of terracotta figures. Both installations also incorporate poetry into the mixture of visual elements.\n\nIn addition to drawing and painting, Husain also practiced lithography and print-making at the Kanoria Centre for Arts. With apprenticeships under influential Indian artist Jagdish Swaminathan in Bhopal, and Robert Blackburn at the Printmaking Workshop in New York, Husain developed a rich mixed-media practice early into his career. While his practice is primarily based in painting, influences of Italian black and white cinema and the vibrant cinema culture of southern India led to Husain’s experimentation with film and sound in the 90’s. He has since directed and produced several feature length Hindi films, 2000-2007, and an experimental music track for the Abu Dhabi Festival of Thinkers in 2009.\n\nHusain was born in 1967 in Mumbai and graduated with his Fine Arts degree from Sir J.J School of Art in 1990. He has exhibited in numerous group and solo shows throughout galleries and museums in India; including the National Museum of Art and Tao Gallery, Mumbai (1995 – 2010), Vadehra Gallery, New Delhi (1995 -1998), Gallery 88 Calcutta (2000), and Sakshi Gallery Bangalore (1994); and internationally at the Tate Modern, London (2001), Aicon Gallery New York (2006), the W Foundation, Seoul (2014), and the Burj Khalifa and Capsule Arts, Dubai (2013, 2015). His films have been screened at the London International Film Festival (2000), the Berlin Film Biennale (2001), the Cannes Film Festival and Melbourne International Film Festival (2004), the Tribeca International Film Festival, Doha (2010), and the Victoria & Albert Museum, London (2014).\n\nOwais Husain currently lives and works in Dubai and Mumbai.\n\nRamola Ramesh Motwani is the Chairwoman of Merrimac Ventures, the Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based real estate management, investment, and development company that she runs alongside her sons, Nitin and Dev. Merrimac concentrates on hospitality and mixed-use development with an emphasis on prime land, as well as multifamily residential, condominiums, retail, and office sectors. Motwani oversees the company’s business strategy and advises new projects through the development process.\n\nWhile Merrimac Ventures began its journey in South Florida, through Motwani’s tenacious leadership, the Firm has substantially expanded its holdings into a national footprint. Today, Merrimac is leading or co-developing 18 hospitality, residential and retail projects valued above $3 billion. Current and recent developments include the Miami Worldcenter, the Four Seasons Hotel and Private Residences Fort Lauderdale, The Gale Boutique Hotel and Residences, Paramount Fort Lauderdale Beach, the Conrad Hilton Fort Lauderdale, the Four Seasons Hotel & Residences, Telluride, Colorado, and the Waldorf Astoria Pompano Beach, among others. The Firm’s current pipeline of future development totals more than $3.7 billion in value.\n\nThe Merrimac Ventures’ story is one of triumph over adversity, and is a testament to how the vision and hard work of the Motwani family helped transform a city.\n\nIn the 1980’s, Ramola Motwani first visited Fort Lauderdale with her husband, Ramesh “Bob” Motwani, and their two young sons Nitin and Dev, on vacation from their home in St. Charles, Missouri, where the family, originally from India, ran a wholesale and retail import business and managed multiple apartment rentals. The Motwanis were lured by Fort Lauderdale’s tropical climate and saw the business potential to invest in the area, piggybacking on the steady revenue from the rowdy yet reliable Spring Break crowd that promised such high returns.\n\nTogether, Ramola and Bob shored up finances to acquire the Gold Coast, Tropic Cay, and Merrimac motels, expanding their rental business into Fort Lauderdale Beach. The couple owned and operated them all until Bob suddenly passed away in 1994 at the height of their momentum, not long after the city had cracked down on the seasonal debauchery of the Spring Break crowds, forcing many moteliers to slip into bankruptcy. Through perseverance, Ramola Motwani was able to hold onto the portfolio and expand it significantly by acquiring additional properties and she single handedly secured the unanimous city approval for the first luxury hotel on Ft Lauderdale Beach, Nitin joined Ramola in 2004, followed by Dev in 2006. Today Ramola has operated several hotels in Broward County, predominantly on Fort Lauderdale Beach, and has become one of the most pioneering and active local community leaders, profoundly passionate about South Florida’s real estate and hospitality industries.\n\nMotwani’s philanthropic focus centers around education. She serves as a State Board Member of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association’s Education Committee as well as the Broward Chapter, where she implemented and now spearheads the first Hospitality Management Program for High Schools in Broward County. In 2019, Ramola established The Motwani Family Academy for Hospitality and Tourism Management. In partnership with Broward College and inspired in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Bob Motwani’s passing, The Academy supports education initiatives through an initial endowment and the creation of scholarships, internships, and mentorships for deserving students. The Motwani Academy at Broward College, as it’s officially named, brings an array of experiential learning opportunities that result in graduates who are ready to hit the ground running in pursuit of a career in hospitality. The program is focused on developing the knowledge and skills that underpin an array of professions ranging from hotel management and food service to hospitality law and financial management. In 2024 she sponsored three of the Academy students to attend the Les Roches summer program abroad, where they learned about first class hospitality service.\n\n“Hospitality is an industry I want to redefine,“ says Motwani. “I share my husband’s dream and continue to be committed to growing, shaping and enhancing our industry, and we’re thrilled to partner with Broward College who will develop future leaders who will contribute to this burgeoning industry, which is one path to accomplishing this goal. When you educate one person, you change generations.”\n\nEngaged in the Fort Lauderdale community, Mrs. Motwani has been a major force in beach development and redevelopment, transforming the beach from small hotels and motels to an upscale luxury market. She planned the Centennial Beach Fest celebration with the City Commission. She was also the founding chairwoman for the Holiday Lights on the Beach and a founding chairwoman of the annual Jeb Bush Classic Beach Bash fundraiser benefiting the Cystic Fibrosis foundation. Furthermore, she was instrumental in successfully organizing the efforts to bring back the Ft Lauderdale Air Show in 2012.\n\nRamola Motwani is an active member of the Broward Workshop, and a member of the United Way of Broward County, serving as their chairwoman for the annual Mayor’s Gala in 2015. She is a member of the Tourist Development Council (an advisory board to the Broward county commission). She serves as a member of the Cleveland Clinic Weston Board of Trustees..
