What is a Cookie?\n\nCookies are small bits of data stored on the device (computer, mobile phone, tablet or any other mobile device) that you use to access BoundaryAI websites or Services.\n\nWe use the word “cookies” as a catchall term to include not only cookies, but also other technologies such as pixels, web beacons and page tags.\n\nWe use cookies for several reasons. Below we describe the various types and purposes of cookies we use on our Site and Services.\n\n2. What Cookies Do We Use?\n\nOur Sites and Services use both first party cookies (which are set by the Sites being visited) and third party cookies (which are set by a server located outside the domain of our Sites).\n\n3. Why Do We Use Cookies?\n\nWe use cookies and similar technologies for several reasons:\n\nTo gather metrics.\n\nFor example, we will collect data about the number of clicks it took Respondents to complete a survey, whether they left and returned to a survey, whether they skipped parts of a survey and how long it took to complete the survey and other details about the survey taking. We also record clicks of the survey creation process to determine whether the product is intuitive enough so as to improve the overall service experience. This information is collated and kept at an aggregated, pseudonymized level.\n\nFor security reasons.\n\nWe use cookies to authenticate your identity and confirm whether you are currently logged into our site or determine if an incident impacts you.\n\nTo improve our services.\n\nWe use cookies to analyze and measure your visits to and exploration of our websites and track referral data. This information helps us to develop and improve our services (it helps us focus on the parts of the service you seem most interested in).\n\nGoogle Analytics.\n\nWe use Google Analytics as a tool to measure how our Websites and Services are used. The Google Analytics data collected for these purposes is aggregated and anonymous.\n\n4. Required Cookies\n\n(Example: a cookie used for login authentication)\n\nRequired cookies are necessary in order for the Sites and Services to operate correctly and remain secure, to ensure delivery of the Services, and to stabilize the Sites. Often these cookies are set in response to a request for service or\n\nfunctionality made by you.\n\n5. Functional Cookies\n\n(Example: a cookie that stores your language preference)\n\nFunctional cookies collect information about your choices and preferences. This allows us to present the Sites according to the settings you selected. These cookies also collect information about your use of the Sites and Services which enable us to test new features and improve functionality. For example, these cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on the Sites, help us record any diﬃculties you have with the Sites, and show us whether our advertising is eﬀective or not at an aggregated level. In some cases these cookies allow us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Sites and Services, rather than the usage of a single person (except where that is part of the necessary function of the cookie).\n\n6. Advertising Cookies\n\nWe do not use advertising cookies.\n\n7. How Do I Manage Cookies?\n\nAs we do not use advertising cookies, we assume users agree to the cookie usage when logging into their account. Users can still remove or disable cookies within their browser settings. The settings and steps for managing cookies vary by browser, so we suggest referring to your browser’s documentation. One important note is that if you do go this route, this might adversely impact your ability to use our services eﬀectively. Enabling certain types of cookies\n\nensures a smoother experience when you use our site.\n\nYou can also see this external website: https://www.aboutcookies.org/ If you are a customer and you separately use cookies or similar technologies on your site in conjunction with our products, you are independently responsible for management of the data collected through those cookies and for compliance with all laws related to usage of these technologies.\n\n8. Do Not Track Disclosure\n\nRegulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission have promoted the concept of Do Not Track as a mechanism to permit Internet users to control online tracking activity across websites through their browser settings. Since no industry standard has been adopted, we currently do not process or comply with any web browser’s “do-not-track” signal or other similar mechanism that indicates a request to disable online tracking of individual users who visit our Sites or use our Services.",

      "# Post ID r1n5pt: Warfield 100 - A Full Battle Royale Experience with +477 score by [(chbmg, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/)\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29atjkx60o181.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=59680ba6dd37a52ed7145eb4b5566dc3b4c18f5b\n\nAfter spending more hours in the rules editor than I care to admit, I'm pleased to announce the creation of a full battle royale experience for Battlefield Portal:\n\n***\"Warfield 100\" is a 100-player battle royale. Features include a pre-game lobby, parachuting into action, a closing circle, random ground loot, a prison, and a spectator mode.***\n\nI'll be hosting the game frequently for the next 1-2 hours and randomly throughout the upcoming days. You should be able to search for it by the name \"Warfield\" or the full name \"Warfield 100 - Battle Royale\" (the server name should be \"Warfield Server\" too).\n\nIf you want to host it yourself, here's the code: **AAGDWA**\n\nAlthough the game mode itself uses a lot of custom visual aids to explain everything, I'm including all the current details below for anyone who's interested. For those who don't want a wall of text, you can just skip everything below, search for the game, and join!\n\nP.S. I play on PC but I use a controller (yes, I'm a masochist) AND I'm pretty trash at most FPS games (still love them). I mention this to assure anyone who joins that any bot running around with my username is indeed a human player. I'm also an indie game developer in the \"real world\" and I'm happy to answer questions about the rules editor for this mode or anything else when I can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWARNING: Wall of text below for the extra curious...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Full Game Details:**\n\nNOTE: Everything below is obviously subject to change over time from tweaks and bug fixes.\n\nThe game starts with a 60-second pre-game lobby to wait for human players to join (anyone who joins after the pre-game lobby is set to spectate). Everyone gets a random loadout in the pre-game lobby. There are 100 \"active\" PvP AI that are replaced by human players as people join the game. If more than 100 humans join, then some \"inactive/boundary\" AI will disappear and these extra human players will be set to spectate only \\[see limitations below\\]. The inactive/boundary AI are constantly \"spotted\" (glow red) and are used as follows: 12 for larger circle, 12 for inner circle, and 4 for the rectangular prison area (corners). The 24 AI for the circle all start out in one giant circle until the first circle contraction.\n\nWhen the pre-game lobby ends, everyone is \"terminated\" \\[see limitations below\\] and redeploys in the sky with an M1911 and grenades (except AI players - they get random loadouts since they don't know how to pickup loot). When first landing, it's a good idea to search for ground loot. There will be an on-screen message indicating the distance to the nearest loot. Ground loot is invisible since the portal editor does not allow the placement of objects (and a bunch of AI players are already used in a \"hacky\" way to represent circle/prison boundaries). When the on-screen message says \"on loot\" (i.e. when a player is within 5 meters of the target), the player must crouch 3 times \\[see limitations below\\] to pickup a new random inventory item (primary/secondary weapon, gadget, or throwable item). The player can currently choose from available scopes on each weapon.\n\nThe circle shrinks and shifts position every 2 minutes - players must stay within the \"larger\" circle that closes into the smaller circle slowly over time. Whenever the circle contracts, the larger circle will slowly shrink for 2 minutes until it reaches the inner circle. Players take damage when outside the larger circle. Players who die are sent to the prison area and must fight to escape - players only require 1 kill at first but for every additional death (including while in prison), 1 more kill will be needed to leave. Players take severe damage quickly if they try to run from the prison area. If a player requires more than 4 kills to leave prison, then that player is terminated and \"out of the game\" (will redeploy in the sky with a sniper rifle and no ammo to spectate for the rest of the match). Also, when there are only 10 players left in the circle (i.e. not in prison or spectating), then the prison closes and everyone in there is terminated and switches to \"spectating.\" Any players who die after the prison closes go straight to spectating. NOTE: When spectating, a player can simply pull the parachute to gently float and choose any scope on the sniper rifle (which has no ammo intentionally) to watch the rest of the match - spectating players are teleported back upward when they fall too far.\n\nAs with just about any FFA battle royale, the last player remaining is the winner. In the extremely unlikely event that the game gets close to the time limit (currently set to 20 minutes), then the game goes into a \"sudden death\" mode where all players take a random amount of damage every second to help ensure that only 1 player survives/wins within the game time limit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Limitations (mostly based on what's currently available in the rules editor):**\n\n* 28 AI players are normally reserved for circle/prison boundaries, but if more than 100 humans join, then some of these AI players will \"disappear\"\n* Players who join after the pre-game lobby (i.e. 60+ seconds after the game starts) or when there are already 100+ humans will be set to \"spectate\"\n* Even with just a few human players, the \"spotted\" AI are not always visible simultaneously, but messages are also used to indicate the distance/direction to center circle to help navigate\n* \"Active\" AI players (rather than those being used for \"boundaries\") will sometimes fight inactive AI or leave safe zones to die randomly, so the game should be more fun with humans\n* Rather than redeploying, it was necessary to \"terminate\" players to move to different stages (e.g. if you get enough kills to leave prison, you will be immediately \"terminated\" but this doesn't count against your deaths and you are redeployed in the air). For some reason, simply redeploying players wasn't kicking off the \"On Player Deployed\" events\n* When picking up ground loot, it may be necessary to crouch more than 3 times due to the custom code \"while loops\" needing to run on 1-second intervals (alternatively, just switch between crouching/standing \"slowly\" every 1-2 seconds rather than rapidly changing stance)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Wow, I didn't expect a big reception since I'm a newbie to reddit. Thank you very much for the awards and kind words! I'll be trying to answer questions and stuff as I can too, though there may be some delays due to the holidays and my weird sleeping schedule. Also, from the comments and testing, I think the game mode still needs a decent amount of work (e.g. oddly the game often crashes after the game mode is over after the XP screen, needs adjustment to pre-game lobby logic so more players can play rather than being stuck spectating, could use a better loot pickup system as suggested by others, etc.). I hope to have updates for it over time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT2: Just so everyone knows, here is a current list of planned bug fixes and improvements for this mode (roughly in order of planned execution/priority):\n\n1. ~~Fix the game crashing issue that occurs when leaving the game after the pre-game lobby or after the match is complete~~\n2. ~~Adjust the logic for the pre-game lobby to give more time for human players to join (this may need to be implemented after some other items since it could affect my ability to quickly test changes, esp. if I change it to wait for more than 1 human to join)~~\n3. ~~Improve the loot pickup system (thank you for suggestions in the comments!). Specifically, I'll try using interact, adjusting the timer (so loot pickup is faster), or something else so it's faster and more consistent~~\n4. Try to fix a \"disappearing messages\" bug in which human players, besides the hosting player, sometimes do not see normal UI messages in the top-right of the screen (I'm not positive if this one is a bug for me or for the main game developers, but I'll do my best). NOTE: This will likely require extensive testing with other humans and getting feedback...\n5. Fix the \"human players\" counter in the pre-game lobby (this seems to often be stuck at \"1\" even with multiple people in the game)\n6. Fix a minor loot pickup bug that sometimes occurs when picking up a secondary weapon or a gadget when you only have a secondary weapon already (for some reason, this sometimes switches you to a knife or gadget, respectively, and does not let you switch back to a secondary weapon). NOTE: I'm not positive if this one is a bug for me or the Portal team\n\nAfter some fixes, I'm hoping to eventually try to organize a 100-person event so that we can all play together! I'll probably setup something in Discord.\n\nFinally, I'm an indie game developer in real life and will be posting on my company twitter handle too: [https://twitter.com/OneDuckTheory](https://twitter.com/OneDuckTheory) (full disclosure: that's my company). If you're looking for a more stable game from me in the meantime (in a totally different genre), then feel free to check out my website: [https://oneducktheory.com](https://oneducktheory.com) \\- I have a mobile game called Sudowords that's a fusion of Sudoku and Crosswords.\n\nAnyway, I hope to have fixes/improvements out soon for Warfield 100. I plan to keep playing around with BF Portal and can't wait to see what everyone else comes up with too!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT3: I really hope this is my last edit section - this post is long! Below, I'm going to explain changes for any bugs/issues/plans listed in EDIT2. I'll also be updating the list in EDIT2 above as issues are found and/or fixed. Each \"fix\" below corresponds to the same number as EDIT2 (e.g. #1 below is my explanation for fixing the main crashing issue, which is issue #1 in EDIT2):\n\n1. RESOLVED. The main crashing bug should now be fixed (however, note that other crashes may still sometimes occur due to bugs in BF2042 itself, issues with the Portal servers/logic, etc.). I was able to host several games back-to-back without any crashes (including some where players jumped in and played more than 1 match in a row with me). This was a tough bug to isolate. The issue seems to have been related to \"terminating\" all players with the \"kill\" command in a loop after the pre-game lobby. To fix it, I put in a \"Wait 0.02s\" command after the \"kill\" command, so the game waits 20ms between each termination. **ATTENTION DICE/Ripple:** *This is worth investigating for Portal. It's easy to duplicate too. Just make a FFA with 128 players, create a loop in the \"OnGameModeStarted\" rule such as \"LoopVariable - Global/Variable - From 0 - To CountOf(GetPlayers) - By 1\", and run the \"kill\" command against each individual player in the loop. Even after deleting almost all custom logic for rules like \"OnPlayerDied\" and \"OnPlayerEarnedKill\", this still seemed to briefly overwhelm the server. From that point onward (i.e. after terminating all players once in a loop), the entire game would crash if the host left the match or after the match ended, even if everything seemed to run fine otherwise. Also, this workaround of \"terminating players\" was only needed anyway because the \"OnPlayerDeployed\" rule would only trigger consistently if a player had died first (i.e. it would be much more preferable to simply undeploy/redeploy players rather than needing to terminate them). Hopefully, these sorts of issues will be addressed in future updates to Portal.*\n2. RESOLVED. This one was technically resolved by fixing the main crashing bug above, so I'm marking it as completed too. Basically, I don't think a change to the pre-game lobby logic/countdown is needed as long as matches can run back-to-back. If someone hosts this game mode on a Portal server continuously and it isn't crashing, then anyone who joined late can simply play in the next match (as long as there are 100 or less humans per server).\n3. RESOLVED. The loot pickup system now uses \"interact\" rather than \"crouch\" and should also be more consistent. It may still be necessary to press interact a few times, but I've made it as responsive as I can. The \"while loop\" associated with it now uses \"Wait 0.1s\" (rather than \"Wait 1s\") and I don't think I should run the loop any faster since it may cause server instability. The associated message is updated as well so everyone knows to use interact.\n4. PENDING\n5. PENDING\n6. PENDING\n\nSTUFF THAT BROKE IN BF2042 UPDATE #3 (12/2/2021): All my custom portal experiences were giving \"validation errors\" when anyone tried to host them, incl. me - I simply needed to make any small change, revert it, and save the experience to fix it. Also, there no longer seem to be 127 bots with me when I run the game mode solo (looks like they now have it capped to 64 PvP AI, including the 28 I reserved for boundaries, so boundary points may be missing and there are fewer bots in general when playing solo or with a small group). This last issue is unfortunately out of my control, just like sometimes being unable to pick up weapons dropped by killed players and other weird bugs in BF/Portal itself. Hopefully, DICE/Ripple will fix these issues over time - there are many bugs and it seems even more were introduced in this update.\n\nI'm trying to make changes to this game mode carefully due to its popularity. I have a few copies of it in Portal for testing various changes before implementing. However, there is still a possibility that something \"game-breaking\" can happen to the main version (whether from my own changes, updates to the game/Portal itself, etc.), so I just want everyone to be aware. I'll also continue posting real-time updates on my company twitter: [https://twitter.com/OneDuckTheory](https://twitter.com/OneDuckTheory)\n\n## Comment ID hm045p0 with +77 score by [(battleship_hussar, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/hm045p0/) (in reply to ID r1n5pt):\nHoly hell a closing circle?

Yeah, that happened to me a lot too during play testing on PC. I was originally hoping it was just me or a bug in the game itself, rather than the custom game mode. I really appreciate the bug report. My best guess is that the game engine itself doesn't properly cleanup custom Portal code/rules when a game ends (maybe loops running in the background after the \"end game\" command cause a crash?). Leaving the game in the pre-game lobby didn't seem to cause a crash for me (seems to happen later or after the match) so I'll keep testing/investigating.\n\n#### Comment ID hm2rydd with +1 score by [(slim2897, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/hm2rydd/) (in reply to ID hm2lsas):\nCan I play this on ps4?

I originally started building the game mode with PvE AI rather than PvP, but I opted for PvP to fill up the lobby so there'd always be plenty of bots running around if humans did not join. Basically, if the game mode used 28 PvE AI and only a few humans joined, then it would be a slower game with lots of space and few active players. I didn't see a way to mix PvE and PvP, so I just went with PvP AI in the end (mixing the two types would be ideal though, if it's currently possible or possible in an update)\n\n## Comment ID hlzrxbg with +21 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/hlzrxbg/) (in reply to ID r1n5pt):\nOh hell yeah, nice!\n\n### Comment ID hlzvb40 with +6 score by [(chbmg, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/hlzvb40/) (in reply to ID hlzrxbg):\nThanks!\n\n## Comment ID hm10hfx with +7 score by [(Yolom4ntr1c, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/hm10hfx/) (in reply to ID r1n5pt):\nholy, shit.

I'm totally willing to share chunks and explain specific functionality, but I'm not yet ready to share everything for a few reasons:\n\n1. I think it could actually hold back the community to a degree. There are probably better ways of doing certain things, so I'd be sad if any future battle royale modes for Portal had the same shortcomings from people just copying/pasting. Plus, I wholeheartedly believe in the \"teach a person to fish\" theory\n2. On that same note, there are still some significant issues to fix (e.g. my first version seems to often crash the whole game after the match is over and I don't yet know exactly why). I think sharing the chunks of code that I know aren't problematic (i.e. from before that issue surfaced) makes more sense right now\n3. I put in a lot of hours and even dug up an old physics textbook to make this mode. I'd like to have at least a little credit, even a minor note of my username for derivative works. Even if someone made an exact copy and kept the quick note of my username at the start of the match, it would be a copy of my (currently flawed) version of the game mode. If I make improvements, they won't apply to that copy. Alternatively, if people host the game by using the 6-digit code in my original post, then they'll see the most up-to-date version. It might seem a little vain or selfish, but I'm human (and again, I'm all for sharing/explaining specifics too rather than just a big data dump of everything). If you'd like to know how I calculated whether players were in boundaries, how I placed loot, etc., then I'm totally happy to help!\n\ntl;dr I just think it would best to share/explain snippets of code. It's likely more beneficial to the Portal community, elevates everyone, and (admittedly selfishly) makes me feel like my own creation is still special for now since there will undoubtedly be better things in the future. We may all still be scratching the surface of what's possible, esp. with updates to Portal functionality.\n\n#### Comment ID hmn9kjf with +1 score by [(Polluxx13, Reddit, 2021-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/hmn9kjf/) (in reply to ID hm2tua4):\nI understand you completely and you're right, maybe it's even better that way.  \nI just would like to have a way later to make a private game only with my friends and that is only possible if i copy the editor code or?  \nAlso small adjustments like hit damage map size max participants etc.  \nBut thanks for explaining it so detailed\n\n#### Comment ID hv2ck6j with +1 score by [(ItsHavenH, Reddit, 2022-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/hv2ck6j/) (in reply to ID hm2tua4):\nI want to at least know how you got the ground loot done\n\n### Comment ID hmihlgc with +1 score by [(OSCH04, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/hmihlgc/) (in reply to ID hm0kq0y):\nHow did you do the Circle ?\n\n## Comment ID hm0l5u9 with +5 score by [(_dominicdecoco_, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/hm0l5u9/) (in reply to ID r1n5pt):\nThis is great dude, I can only imagine what you will do once they add more to the logic. \n\nPS. love your take on the spectator mode\n\n## Comment ID hlztwvy with +5 score by [(jayswolo, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/hlztwvy/) (in reply to ID r1n5pt):\nSounds pretty cool, but why not use interact to pick up loot? 3x interact?\n\n### Comment ID hlzw0iu with +11 score by [(chbmg, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/hlzw0iu/) (in reply to ID hlztwvy):\nThanks!

I'd guess between all the arrays and subroutines that it's well over 1,000 blocks. I didn't run into any hard limits, but I noticed my web browser was seriously struggling once I had hundreds of blocks. It's gotten to a point where the \"save\" button in the browser only works about half the time. Also, the game mode needed a bunch of optimization (and probably needs more) since I was seeing a lot of symbols on the left side of the screen while play testing (I'm guessing indicating server resource issues). The only \"major\" limit I ran into was a weird error in the Admin logs when play testing an early version of the game mode (I don't remember the exact wording, but it basically sounded like my custom game logic was taking more than 50ms per loop to process so the server just gave up and the game transformed back into a vanilla FFA).\n\n#### Comment ID hm78w6l with +1 score by [(AdSad2167, Reddit, 2021-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/hm78w6l/) (in reply to ID hm2uzrv):\nAs an FYI, as I've ran into performance issues on Portal when handling hundreds of blocks -- if the Portal Builder gets too sluggish it might even begin to replace your player variables randomly and deleting others outright.

And absolutely, a multi team template is probably my number one wish list item for Portal! I really wanted to make this with squads originally rather than a pure solo/FFA experience, but I couldn't find a good way to do this. It actually should be theoretically possible using the TDM template with friendly fire and some way of assigning squads (and maybe making each squad a single soldier type for identification), but it would be way better if they gave us a multi-team template to have anywhere from like 3 to 32 teams.\n\n## Comment ID hm160zo with +2 score by [(kuluuu, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/hm160zo/) (in reply to ID r1n5pt):\na video playing this pls?\n\n### Comment ID hm744ts with +1 score by [(chbmg, Reddit, 2021-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/hm744ts/) (in reply to ID hm160zo):\nI didn't make this, but I found it today.

I'm having trouble creating the AI circles I've been seeing pop up on Portal for different modes and registering when players are within the circle.\n\n### Comment ID hm33lpv with +3 score by [(chbmg, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/hm33lpv/) (in reply to ID hm1e6g0):\n[https://imgur.com/URiZM9l](https://imgur.com/URiZM9l)\n\n(you may need to download the image above to fully zoom in)\n\nThat's the rule that's used to position players (in this case, AI PvP bots) in circles.\n\nWARNING: Lots of math ahead to explain...\n\nBasically, I created a few variables to help with these calculations (a player variable called \"Angle\" and global variables like \"CircleDetailsArray\" and \"LastCircleArray\"). Those global circle arrays (which are just \"global variables\" in Portal-speak) hold the radius and X, Z coordinates of the circle centers, respectively (i.e. they each have 3 elements/indices). Before this rule is called (at the start of the game mode), there's a separate function that checks to see if a player is AI (using player state bool) and assigns the \"Angle\" variable to each of those players to 5 + 15X degrees (where X = 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., so that it's 5 degrees, 20 degrees, 35 degrees, 50 degrees, etc.) until X = 23 (which is 350 degrees). Thus, we have a full circle with 24 points broken into 15 degree increments (though my game technically uses 2 circles with 12 points each and 30 degree increments). Then, for X = 24 to 27, the angle is just set equal to X (these last 4 are for the 4 corners of the prison area). All other players have an \"Angle\" value of 0.\n\nThe rule in the screenshot runs on a \"While\" loop constantly (has a \"Wait 1\" or \"Wait 2\" command at the end) and teleports all players who have an angle associated with those 15 degree increments to the proper locations (this is based on the IF statements checking if \"Angle - 5\" modulo 15 = 0, and there's one for modulo 30 since there are technically \"2 circles\" such that each bot per circle is actually spaced apart by 30 degrees). There's some slightly advanced math involved with this (it helps to know some trigonometry), but basically, the teleport function is sending players to the proper X/Z coordinates for a circle (Y is set to 0 since the game seems to automatically place players on the ground due to Y = 0 being below the map, though rarely these bots still fall through the ground on a loop). The X coordinate is \"(radius \\* cosine(Angle)) + (circle center's X position)\" and the Z coordinate is \"(radius \\* sine(Angle)) + (circle center's Z position).\n\nFinally, to answer your question about seeing if a player is inside a circle, that part is actually way easier. You basically just have to use the \"Distance\" rule block (in the Math menu in portal editor) to check the distance from the player's current position vector (where you would use \"X Component\" and \"Z Component\" from the Math menu and set Y = 0) to the position of the circle's center (again, use \"Create Vector\" for this vector and fill in the X and Z values for the circle's actual center position, but leave Y = 0 since we only care about the distance in a flat 2D plane - you'd use Y values if you cared if the player was in a sphere instead). You'd then just see if the distance is less than the radius of the circle - if so, the player is inside the circle.\n\nWhew, I hope that all makes sense. I was a physics major long ago but I still had to break out an old textbook for a refresher on dot products when figuring out if players are in an arbitrary rectangle, which is actually significantly harder. If you're curious about that, then this link is probably better than me trying to describe it: [https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/190111/how-to-check-if-a-point-is-inside-a-rectangle](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/190111/how-to-check-if-a-point-is-inside-a-rectangle)\n\nEDIT: One big note is that that while loop (using While \"true\" so it never stops) may be part of the problem with the game mode sometimes crashing in later game stages, such as after the game is over or when leaving the game AFTER the pre-game lobby. I'm not sure yet, but just a word of caution that it's probably bad practice (and lazy on my part) to just use a \"while true\" loop. I'll try adjusting any such loops in an update to see if this fixes crashing, but wanted to warn you in case you copy pieces of code exactly.\n\n#### Comment ID hm35reg with +6 score by [(sverrebe, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/hm35reg/) (in reply to ID hm33lpv):\nDice hire this man\n\n#### Comment ID hm3mgky with +2 score by [(AdSad2167, Reddit, 2021-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/hm3mgky/) (in reply to ID hm33lpv):\nJfc man, that's amazing!

Also, it's only available on PC and next-gen consoles (due to the game having a 64-player limit on last-gen consoles). However, if you have one of the new consoles, you can host the game yourself using the 6-digit code in my original post.

I'm hoping to have most of the game mode bugs sorted out in the next few days as long as the portal website and BF itself are stable.

As for randomly spawning AI, I think there are a lot of ways to go about it. In another comment in this post, I included a link to a screenshot of my logic editor settings for creating a circle of bots and explained how it works. If you wanted to have bots spawn all around you and then wonder around, you could teleport them once in a circle where your position is the center but with a random radius (say, between 10m and maybe 300m) so that they are all located in random spots at varying distances. However, if you use the FFA template, then they already spawn all over the map at random without any custom coding needed (although they'd obviously attack each other too in that scenario). If you're using a TDM template (which would make sense in a survival mode), then I'd probably go with either a circle with a random radius or walk around the map with messages displaying your x,y,z coordinates to find 4 corners of a \"rectange\" area and then set the bots to spawn at random x,z coordinates within the confines of that rectangle (say, using teleport with x and z values being random numbers between a min and max for the rectangle). Hope that helps and makes sense. Again, I have more details on the circle mechanic in my reply to a different comment too.\n\n#### Comment ID hop0v50 with +1 score by [(AceTemplar21, Reddit, 2021-12-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlefieldPortal/comments/r1n5pt/warfield_100_a_full_battle_royale_experience/hop0v50/) (in reply to ID hon0f8y):\nI really appreciate it.

      "# Post ID 1dw2mum: How real is AI hype? with +40 score by [(Happysedits, Reddit, 2024-07-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1dw2mum/how_real_is_ai_hype/)\nPeople are currently debating if AI revolution will transform and automate everything in existence in one nanosecond and no jobs will exist or/and eats the whole universe in one nanosecond, or if AI is only just hype and nothing else. \n\nI think reality is in the middle. It's a very transformative technology that is already under so much of our system's infrastructure and the generative AI waves adds even more cool tools and systems to the toolbox for experts, engineers, non-technical people and so on. And I don't see the advancing (in many ways exponential, in many ways linear) progress of this technology stopping anytime soon.\n\nThe extreme hype drives funding which creates better technology in self reinforcing self fullfiling prophecy way but at the same time it creates overly inflated expectations disconnected from actual reality that then crash in dissapointment, but on the opposite extreme too little hype doesn't realize the actual realistic transformative potential of the technology, and AI is extremely amazing technology that is under so many things already and I use a lot for a lot of pragmatic things with so many of the recent new breakthroughs with applications and products! It's amazing! But I think that we have to be aware realistic dangers and mitigate them, but at the same time be aware of the actual practical limitations of the current and mainly short term future technologies while giving some of attention to the possible long term future technologies as well, but IMO not too much.\n\nThere seems to be this general pattern that repeats, where some hype wave about something grows and grows too big if unchecked by reality checks from real world implementations and people working there, that eats almost the whole memetic transmission channels that is so strong that it starts getting (sometimes more, sometimes less) out of touch with reality, and as a result a completely polar opposite movement emerges and culture war starts with two polar opposites fighting with each other and fueling each other's validation and realness this way. But eventually these two sides most of the time merge into one, or stay in war for long, or divide into even more nuanced tribes fighting each other for dominance, but often with at least some degree of cooperative mechanisms.\n\nIt's like initial metaverse hype, quantum computing hype, initial internet hype, open source vs closed source, AI caution/fundamental safety vs AI pure accelerationism, technology accelerationism vs deaccelerationism in general, AI scepticism vs AI super optimistic believism, political left vs right,...\n\nOne can argue if these various hype cycles had more advantages or disadvantages, if they were more constructive or destructive in more good or bad or neutral directions etc., how connected to actual reality they were etc. In the case of AI I think that the not as strong version of the hype is actually more connected to reality than a lot of AI sceptics think.\n\nIt's like two dissonant attractors self reinforcing each other with even more dissonance (Andres from QRI thinks similar formalism holds for bad 5-MeO-DMT trips too) in the physics of cultural memetics. And then these mutually dissonant (statistical) attractors merge into one attractor when their individual metastability gets too unstable and their overlap gets too big, or continue fighting if they're individually metastable enough, or split into even more dissonant attractors forming even me clusters of coherence with mutual competing dissonance on some levels of analysis, but unifying cooperative coherence on other levels of analysis.\n\n## Comment ID lbrp38n with +72 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-07-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1dw2mum/how_real_is_ai_hype/lbrp38n/) (in reply to ID 1dw2mum):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID lbs9v0z with +8 score by [(Bierculles, Reddit, 2024-07-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1dw2mum/how_real_is_ai_hype/lbs9v0z/) (in reply to ID lbrp38n):\nAlso to add to this, nobody knows if and when scaling and progress will hit a wall or not.

They were expecting the service in a few weeks, but there was a delay. The claim now is that it was just hype but reality is probably that they were working on voice for over a year and ran into a snag then had to delay it a few months.

The tricky point here is however that this was probably one of our last big shots. With the current general decline of pretty much everything I think we don't have a lot of time left before we are not able to build in such dimensions. IQ is going down. The next generation of young people is measurable less educated,  intelligent and less attention span, and the socio economic decline is progressing and climate change now has really started. \n\n\nSo I dont think that 2050 any large scale scientific endeavors will be prio one anymore or even possible.

Managers try to shove it into every single product without any use case whatsoever just to please shareholders.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe the current influx of capital, and the general impression that \"holy smokes AGI might actually be within reach\" will in fact bring us closer to AGI. When this craze fizzles out, compute capacity will be abundant, and smart people are flowing into the field. Serious researchers are now saying it's about a 50-50 that we achieve general intelligence in the next 20 years.

Even if we forget about AI and just look at compute performance; **there has been more gain in raw compute performance from 2018 to today than from 1950 to 2018**. A few years ago, I might have said that just having the theoretical performance of a human brain isn't enough for intelligence, but now I no longer  think that.

It is also a bubble. Why? Because it is likely that only one or two companies will have adapted and used products in the long term, 95% will have nothing other than money burned through fast af. When investors realize that many many companies have no product, no own product or no product actually adapted by any market they will stop investing. And that is just one issue. The biggest companies, those that are to say \"too big to fail\", such as Amazon, Google, Apple or Facebook will either be one of those winners, or stop investing in \"AI\", likely going for true Artificial Intelligence, rather than llm, image generation etc. And that is where it will fail. \n\nIn the end, I think the bubble will not burst because of technological impossibilities, but rather because investors lose faith in most companies as they fail to bring a truly revolutionary product (see \"humane AI\" and their pin, as example; that was something new, and it failed horrendously). Effectively, what (stress on THIS) currently exists, has little long term usage, and that is where I think the market will collapse if nobody makes a true change (reliable llm, image generation etc), and even if that happens, there is reason enough to believe, \"AI-Art\" is not here to stay, as humans crave the distinctly and truly human.\n\n## Comment ID lbs30wm with +1 score by [(_hisoka_freecs_, Reddit, 2024-07-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1dw2mum/how_real_is_ai_hype/lbs30wm/) (in reply to ID 1dw2mum):\nAi hype is very obvious and is quite literally going to kill us all or send us all to nirvana in time.

Eventually an AI will optimize that as well.\n\nAll that would remain in terms of jobs would be creative fields where new scientific innovations or art are highly valued and even there humans will heavily rely on an AI to do the tasks.\n\nBUT BUT BUT BUT wait - the question you are asking is, can the AI researchers actually develop such a powerful AI???\n\nIn essence it is distilled to one simple thing. Can AI researchers solve the 'SYMBOL GROUNDING' PROBLEM.\n\nSo what is this Symbol grounding problem? Here is how I would describe it.\n\nThe ability to take the set of symbols (words, numbers, attributes) that we as humans use for all forms of thinking without which there is no intelligence and take those symbols under any setting and ground them to some form of base reality in order to reason correctly. If an AI can do that then intelligence would be considered as solved. The key is under ANY setting.\n\nI think an AI will be able to do that and it is a question of not how often it can do it but how often it will fail. If it fails in 0.0001% or 1% of the scenarios, that is still enough to get 99% automation of all human activities.\n\nLastly, THE BOY WHO CRIELD AI: The way AI researchers at Google, Open AI, Microsoft, Tesla and Meta are operating, it seems like they are enabling this sort of AI supremacy so they can control it in the name of safety and this would make all of us, our past history including the smart researchers who contributed to AI irrelevant and powerless. This would essentially make the hype a form of cheering our own demise.

It was impossible to “compute” a solution to this. Now it actually understands the common sense meaning of those words. You can ask it “does a suitcase fit through a door” and it’s able to understand what you mean. You can give it a joke, even a new one, and it can explain the joke to you! People banged their head against the wall for 60+ years to solve this kind of common sense reasoning. \n\nThink project Cyc, which swallowed millions and went on for over 30 years without accomplishing much.\n\n“Cyc and the quest to solve common sense reasoning in AI”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3wMKoSRbGVs?si=ask3NAxpgtK2FfSw\n\nNow the last bit. It’s not actually that speculative if you just believe in one thing: human intelligence is very very finite. \n\nThe computers we currently have are damn fast. They can do several petaflops. That’s literally as fast if not faster than the brain (number of neurons x number of synapses per neuron x operations per second). And those computers are getting better and better by the day. There is absolutely every reason to believe that:\n\n1) computers will soon be much smarter than us (just by simply extrapolating the FLOPS)\n2) when they are smarter than us, computers will soon do the computer science research for us and improve themselves (the software part, but also chip design + fabrication techniques will be improved by AI) \n3) this positive feedback loop will lead to insane AI capabilities that go beyond any imagination.\n\nHere is why I believe in the last point: while your brain can do x computations per second (a petaflop essentially, 100 billion x 1000 x 10), It’s nowhere near optimized. The brain is a bag of tricks through some random evolutionary process. There is a ton of noise in the brain and a lot of correlated activity. AI on the other hand can tune its own systems to near optimal given enough IQ and enough time. So a petaflop computer won’t be as smart as a human, it will be as smart as a million humans. And we already have a petaflop computer… that fits in a shoebox.\n\n### Comment ID lbtlr5b with +2 score by [(Pyehouse, Reddit, 2024-07-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1dw2mum/how_real_is_ai_hype/lbtlr5b/) (in reply to ID lbsmoaz):\nI think anyone with even a passing interest in AI can see this change is coming.

      "# [The Artificiality: How Life and Intelligence Emerge from Information and Shape the Human Experience by Helen Edwards on 2025-01-17](https://www.artificiality.world/the-artificiality/)\nThe Artificiality describes the merging of synthetic systems with organic experience, where AI and other technologies reshape our reality. At the heart of this evolution is the dynamic progression from information to computation, computation to agency, agency to intelligence, and intelligence to consciousness. This flow illustrates how technology transforms from passive tools into active participants, challenging us to reimagine the future of human experience when machines have agency and even minds of their own.\n\nThis article is an exploration of The Artificiality. In it we examine the progression from information to consciousness in the age of synthetic systems, exploring how AI reshapes the foundations of reality. Information was once a static resource—cataloged, clarified, and mapped to reduce uncertainty. Computation transformed this static data into dynamic processes, while agency gave machines the capacity to act. Intelligence allowed systems to learn and adapt, but it is the boundary of consciousness (ours and perhaps eventually theirs)—where machines reveal emergent, often alien patterns. This forces a reconsideration of reality itself.\n\nAt each step of this flow, AI redefines human perception. It does not simply predict or optimize but participates in co-creating what we understand as real. Machines expose adjacencies—patterns and possibilities beyond our current comprehension—and challenge the fixedness of truth. This article invites you to grapple with how AI shifts human understanding of knowledge, meaning, and our role in a reality that is fluid, emergent, and constantly reinterpreted.\n\nWhy Read This?\n\nTrace the Flow: Follow the progression from information to computation to agency to intelligence to consciousness, and understand how this shapes our evolving reality.\n\nExplore the Boundaries: Investigate how machines blur the lines between perception, action, and meaning, challenging our assumptions about consciousness and reality.\n\nEngage the Big Questions: What does it mean when synthetic systems co-create reality? How do we balance machine clarity with human meaning in this hybrid future?\n\nIn the next 6,600 words (approximately 25 minutes of reading time), we aim to frame these questions not as abstract worries for a future time but as real-world challenges for anyone navigating the world AI is reshaping. As AI diffuses through everything, it will inevitability create winners and losers, lovers and haters, new states of belonging and unbelonging. Our purpose is to understand the deepest, most profound principles that underpin this change to our species.\n\nThe Artificiality is Not Transhumanism\n\nBefore we go on, a quick note. The Artificiality is not about abandoning humanity, transcending biology, or becoming a \"new species.\" It is not a vision of the Singularity as imagined by Ray Kurzweil, nor a call to merge fully with machines and upload our brains to an AI in the cloud. Instead, The Artificiality explores the merging of the synthetic and organic in ways that are deeply rooted in our shared humanity.\n\nWe remain fundamentally humanist in our perspective. This means recognizing that while technology blends the natural and the artificial, our moral reasoning, empathy, and collective choices are the anchor for this transition. The Artificiality is about adapting—not leaving behind what makes us human—to navigate a world where our technology has outpaced our capacity to solve collective challenges. This needs to change.\n\nWe think less about machines taking over or humans becoming irrelevant than we do about using the tools we’ve created to enhance our ability to respond to complex problems and shape a future where meaning, values, and choices remain central. The Artificiality acknowledges the fluidity between synthetic and organic but insists that humanity—our ethics, imagination, ingenuity, and capacity for change—remains at the core.\n\nWhat is Intelligence?\n\nIntelligence is one of humanity's oldest fascinations. It's fair to say we're obsessed with it. Whether it's the intricacies of ant colonies, the neural structures of the brain, and now in artificial systems, we seem desperate to lock it down in a simple definition. Is it the ability to solve puzzles? To plan for the future? To adapt to the unexpected? Or is it something deeper—perhaps a fundamental property of systems that evolve, compute, and interact with their environments?\n\nTo frame this article, we’ll start with an ambitious question: What is intelligence, really? And to ground it, we’ll lean on a principle, described in detail by David Krakauer and Chris Kempes from the Santa Fe Institute, as increasingly seen as foundational—life (and by extension) intelligence, is a process that emerges from information and computation. Whether in biological or artificial systems, intelligence involves gathering, storing, and transforming information to navigate a space of possibilities. These spaces might be physical, conceptual, social, or computational, but the ability to adapt, optimize, and explore defines intelligence across these domains.\n\nOur perspective is that intelligence isn’t just a human trait or an artifact of advanced computation but something that spans scales and substrates.\n\nOur perspective is that intelligence isn’t just a human trait or an artifact of advanced computation but something that spans scales and substrates. So we see it in single-celled organisms navigating their environments, in the bioelectric networks that guide cellular repair, and in the artificial agents now reshaping our digital and physical worlds. It’s not limited to brains or silicon. It's as much about how systems use information to achieve goals as it is about the goals themselves.\n\nDr. Michael Levin’s work beautifully illustrates this idea, showing how intelligence operates not just in brains or silicon but in the fundamental ways systems organize and use information. Levin's work shows that if you cut a planarian worm in half, both halves regenerate into complete worms. This crazy feat doesn’t stem solely from DNA, which remains the same in each fragment, but from the bioelectric signals and information networks shared between cells. These signals act as a kind of blueprint, dynamically guiding the cells to rebuild the organism. This use of information to achieve a goal, like regeneration, is a form of intelligence. Cognition is emergent, and systems, even at their most basic levels, process information to create structure and function.\n\nSo we can now understand that intelligence spans scales and substrates, whether in the electrical fields of a worm or the algorithms of a machine. This reshapes how we understand both biology and technology as participants in a shared informational universe.\n\nIntelligence has many definitions depending on your angle. For some, it is a measure of problem-solving ability, for others, a capacity for adaptation or creativity. For others, it may simply be an ineffable quality that distinguishes living from not.\n\nBut definitions matter, and as AI becomes more powerful and \"intelligent\" by human measures, words have become a contest for control. Silicon Valley and tech giants increasingly frame intelligence in ways that align with their algorithms, their benchmarks, and their markets. The definitions they champion—pattern recognition, optimization, problem-solving—are precise, measurable, and above all, machine-friendly. But they are also incomplete.\n\nBy framing intelligence around what machines excel at, these definitions subtly diminish human, and really all biological, intelligence. Ironically, they also diminish artificial intelligence itself because we constrain what AI could become, boxing it into benchmarks that reflect narrow human priorities rather than exploring its potential as a radically different kind of intelligence.\n\nWe run the risk of not only misrepresenting the richness of human and biological cognition but also stifling the creative evolution of AI systems that might otherwise expand the boundaries of what intelligence could mean. This reductionism limits our collective imagination, keeping both humans and machines tied to familiar, measurable goals rather than encouraging the exploration of new forms of thought and agency.\n\nOf course, there's a more pressing and obvious downside with machine-friendly definitions of intelligence. AI systems never get tired and, in many cases, are more reliable decision-makers, while humans appear slow, error-prone, and suboptimal in comparison. The promise of the analytics movement is that there is a right answer in the data and only machines are capable of finding it. In pursuit of that \"right answer,\" we’ve begun to judge ourselves by what machines are good at.\n\nThis risks reframing intelligence as a narrow pursuit of computational efficiency, stripping away the broader spectrum of what living beings care about—what gives life purpose and, quite literally, what makes life worth living. If we are going to talk about intelligence as computation, then we also have to broaden that view to include forms of reasoning, adaptation, and understanding that are rarely framed as information processing. These are the qualities unique to beings shaped by the pressures of biological evolution. That is, us.\n\nBefore we go on, let's take a moment to check in with the many ways that intelligence has been framed:\n\nProblem-Solving and Adaptation\n\nA traditional view sees intelligence as the ability to solve problems and adapt to new circumstances. This perspective is most common in psychology and education, where tests like IQ scores quantify how individuals reason, learn, and solve puzzles. This is the primary lens that shapes artificial intelligence research, where systems are judged by their ability to optimize, predict, or solve within defined domains.\n\nInformation Processing and Computation\n\nIn information theory, intelligence is reframed as the ability to process, store, and act on information. Here, intelligence is no longer tied to biology. A thermostat, in its simplest sense, exhibits intelligence: it measures temperature and adjusts accordingly. Of course, this definition quickly becomes more interesting when scaled up—think of the processing power of modern AI systems capable of analyzing massive datasets or predicting molecular structures for drug discovery.\n\nAdaptation Across Scales\n\nFor modern biologists and complexity theorists, intelligence operates across scales. Cells exhibit intelligence when they repair wounds or navigate developmental pathways during embryogenesis. This capacity for goal-directed adaptation is not unique to brains—it exists wherever systems process information to achieve desired states. A healing skin cell, a migrating neuron, or a regenerating frog limb all display forms of intelligence.\n\nEmergence and Social Complexity\n\nSociologists and ecologists often emphasize collective intelligence. The coordinated behavior of ants or the flocking of birds demonstrates how simple rules can produce highly adaptive group behavior. Intelligence here is not in the individual but in the network, emerging from interactions and feedback loops.\n\nConscious Experience and Intent\n\nFor philosophers, intelligence is tied to consciousness—the ability to experience, to reflect, and to make intentional decisions. This view draws a line between systems that calculate and systems that feel, suggesting that true intelligence requires a subjective component. As philosopher Thomas Nagel famously asked, “What is it like to be a bat?”—a question about whether intelligence can exist without consciousness.\n\nCreativity and Exploration\n\nAnother definition emphasizes intelligence as the ability to create: to explore beyond existing rules, to discover novel solutions, or to imagine futures that don’t yet exist. This is an intelligence that thrives in ambiguity, engaging with the unknown rather than merely solving for it. It's also the intelligence of biology, of exploring what Stuart Kauffman calls the \"adjacent possible,\" as we will explore later in this article.\n\nAll of these definitions converge on a shared theme: intelligence involves navigating a space of possibilities. These spaces might be physical (a maze, a body, a battlefield), conceptual (a puzzle, a theory, an ethical dilemma), or social (a group, a culture, a market). Intelligence emerges from the interaction of systems with their environments, where information is used to adapt, predict, and act.\n\nSo here we have it—intelligence resists one simple definition. The better definition is the more complex one—it’s the interactions between systems and their environments, where information processing creates meaning. With an artificiality where information and computation spans new spaces, the question is no longer just “What is intelligence?” but “What might intelligence become?”\n\nNext we’ll go into more depth about how information is a common basis and explore how life’s open-ended nature can help us understand how intelligence is as much about creating new possibilities as it is about navigating the present.\n\nHow Information and Computation Connect Life and Technology\n\nHumans are obsessed with intelligence yet it defies a simple definition. Instead we need to think about it more as an emergent property—somehow linking information and computation with achieving goals in the world. The prospect of artificial intelligence exposes how intelligence isn't limited to biology, much less humans. Are we really that special?\n\nIntelligent systems are those that actively engage with their environment to extract meaning from complexity and then subsequently make decisions to guide action. You can think of it this way: intelligence emerges wherever information processing meets purpose.\n\nHere's where we need to shift our focus—from philosophical debates about \"what counts as intelligent\" to understanding the universal mechanisms that enable systems to use information and computation to establish meaning and thereby navigate uncertainty. In biology, intelligence serves survival and adaptation through natural selection over time. In today’s AI, intelligence supports pattern discovery and prediction, often as part of a broader problem-solving process involving life and, therefore, us humans.\n\n\"Life is starting to look a lot less like an outcome of chemistry and physics, and more like a computational process\"\n\n—David Krakauer and Chris Kempes\n\nThere's a fundamental idea here—intelligence connects life and technology. We are uncovering the fundamental patterns that allow any system—organic or synthetic—to set and achieve goals in dynamic environments. But how do joint goals emerge? Or singular ones? If intelligence is neither uniquely biological nor fully artificial, but an emergent property of computational systems that model and respond to their world, we have to ask: where do we end and technology begins? And as traditional boundaries erode, whose goals truly drive the system—ours, AI's, or something new forged in the interaction?\n\nBefore we can tackle such a profound philosophical and scientific question, we first need to understand how life itself uses information to navigate the fundamental challenge of surviving in an uncertain and complex world.\n\nThe challenge of existence is managing uncertainty. Every biological system operates as a sophisticated information processing network that continuously refines its predictive models. Bacteria looking for food might move in a simple way but this is actually an elegant computational strategy. Chemical gradients serve as input data, cellular machinery processes this information, and flagellar motion represents output. A germ is a complete predictive system, adapted to the uncertainties of its environment, operating at the microscopic scale.\n\nThere's a big gap between biological and artificial systems. Biological systems have evolved over millions of years and have fine-tuned a multi-layered approach to managing uncertainty. Biological intelligence is a masterclass in computation: parallel processing, energy efficiency, feedback, and adaptability. Neurons transmit electrochemical signals while dynamically rewiring themselves in response to experience. This is computation optimized for survival. Exploring biological principles—feedback, redundancy, and distributed control—offers valuable inspiration for designing AI architectures that are more dynamic and responsive. These principles are deeply tied to agency and goal formation, as they enable systems to not only adapt to their environment but also shape their objectives in response to changing conditions. It is this dynamic, non-equilibrium aspect that bridges the gap between what's \"programmed\" and how we think about intelligence.\n\nIt's likely that effective intelligence requires dynamic integration with real-world complexity. AI isn't yet truly agentic—it has not mastered the depth of adaptive prediction available to life. Developing real agency in AI—like adapting to changing situations and handling uncertainty to achieve goals—is a key focus of research. To get there, it’s important to understand how information leads to agency, and how agency builds intelligence.\n\nBefore going any further, it's useful to understand what information is. Think of it not as data points or facts, but as nature's way of creating order from chaos. When you reduce uncertainty about something—whether it's finding your keys or one of your cells detecting nutrients—you're working with information.\n\nImagine flipping a coin. Before it lands, there's uncertainty—it could be heads or tails. Once it lands, that uncertainty vanishes. The reduction of uncertainty is information in action. In this case, one bit of information—the amount needed to resolve a choice between two equally likely outcomes. This same principle operates everywhere: in DNA guiding cell development, neurons firing in your brain, or AI systems recognizing patterns.\n\nEntropy enters the picture as a measure of uncertainty or disorder. Systems naturally tend toward disorder (high entropy), but life creates local pockets of order by processing information. Your body maintains its temperature despite changing conditions, and your brain makes sense of visual data despite noisy input. These are both examples of using information to combat entropy.\n\nUnderstanding information this way reveals why it's fundamental to both biological and artificial intelligence. While syntactic information reduces uncertainty, semantic information connects data to purpose and meaning. For biological systems, meaning emerges as survival strategies—finding food, avoiding predators, or reproducing. For AI, this connection is less intuitive but equally critical: how does a system determine what information is relevant and how to act on it? Bridging this gap is key to developing truly adaptive, agentic systems.\n\nWhat sets biological intelligence apart from AI is its fundamentally different approach to processing environmental complexity. Living systems operate through continuous dynamic equilibrium—a state of perpetual refinement where internal models update in real-time. They don’t wait for a perfect dataset or rely on fixed rules. Your body responding to a sudden fever isn’t following a preset script. Instead your immune system uses feedback loops to adapt moment by moment, staying functional even when things change unpredictably.\n\nAI works differently. Neural networks and transformers can process massive amounts of data and predict patterns, but they don’t adapt in real time. Once trained, their ability to handle new situations is limited. They recognize what they’ve seen before and excel within predefined boundaries, but they don’t engage with the messiness of the real world the way your body does.\n\nIf artificial intelligence is going to operate effectively in complex environments, the best proxy we have is to learn from biology. Advancing AI requires more than incremental improvements to existing architectures. We need systems that can continuously refine their internal models while maintaining operational stability. This kind of thinking moves us beyond technical upgrades to focus on the difference between syntactic information—data that reduces uncertainty—and semantic information, which connects that data to meaning, reshaping how we understand agency, prediction, and the creative potential of computation.\n\nFor example, living systems don’t aim for perfect stability. Instead, they succeed by operating at the edge of chaos—a sweet spot between rigid order and total randomness. In a flock of birds, each bird follows simple rules, like keeping a certain distance from its neighbors, but together, the flock behaves like a single, fluid entity. This balance allows the group to respond quickly to predators or obstacles without falling apart.\n\nAI systems need enough structure to stay functional but enough flexibility to innovate and adapt. Large Language Models tuned to operate in this balance—neither too rigid nor too random—are better at tackling more complex or creative problems. They reflect the resilience we see in nature, where adaptability emerges from systems balancing order and disorder.\n\nThis is a lot easier said than done. AI can't generalize or adapt on the fly. In organic systems, whether it’s the chemical signaling of liver cells, the bioelectric networks of planarian worms, or the real-time environmental cues that guide a flock of birds, intelligence emerges through iterative feedback loops. These loops allow systems to adjust their internal models based on new information in real-time, reducing prediction errors and improving adaptation. Bridging this gap is one of AI's biggest challenges.\n\nAs machines become more capable of exploring open-ended problems—designing novel molecules or creating art—they blur the boundaries between narrow intelligence and something more expansive. The key questions are: where do new goals originate, and what is agency when information and computation blur the line between the synthetic and the organic?\n\nNext we’ll go look at how information is a common basis and explore how life’s open-ended nature can help us understand how intelligence is as much about creating new possibilities as it is about navigating the present.\n\nSelfhood and Distributed Agency in a\n\nHybrid World\n\nInformation unites technology and life. The distinction between the organic world of evolved biological beings and the synthetic world of designed entities is fading—not only because machines are imitating humans or because we are so reliant on technology, but because intelligence transcends the gap. Whether in neurons or silicon, intelligence emerges wherever information is processed, predictions are made, and adaptation occurs. Think of intelligence as a space where both collaborate, adapt, and transform rather than simply a trait of humans or machines.\n\nThink of intelligence not as a trait of humans or machines, but as a space where both collaborate, adapt, and transform.\n\nHybrid systems, where AI and human cognition merge, are the clearest expression of this continuum. Neural interfaces already allow paralyzed individuals to control robotic limbs, and over time, the brain rewires itself to treat these synthetic devices as extensions of the body, a shift in the sense of self. Identity becomes more fluid. Intelligence is distributed in new ways.\n\nIt's always been a challenge to draw the line between where we end and technology begins. Tools have always extended our abilities—externalizing memory, amplifying reasoning, or enhancing perception—but they remained static, under our control.\n\nWith AI, this relationship enters a new kind of flux. AI systems adapt, learn, and respond in ways that interact with our own thinking, creating a feedback loop that reshapes how we process the world and define ourselves within it. The self is no longer anchored solely within the mind or body but distributed across systems that influence our choices, goals, and sense of agency. This represents a major shift in the boundaries of cognition and identity—making the line between \"us\" and \"it\" increasingly difficult to draw.\n\nThe same principle we see in physical systems applies to cognitive systems. Language models are more than tools for generating text because they reshape how humans think and create. When you use AI to brainstorm ideas you aren't just delegating creativity but engaging in a feedback loop where the machine’s suggestions provoke new insights. Over time, your thinking adapts to the AI’s capabilities, and the AI, in turn, refines itself based on your input. The result is neither purely human nor purely synthetic—it’s hybrid creativity, an emergent phenomenon that reflects the continuum of intelligence. Using ChatGPT today might not feel like this but it’s coming as more humans learn to co-write (and so co-think) using AI.\n\nDistributed agency is forced upon us at all levels—not just in a philosophical sense but in very practical terms. We can see just how fluid—and poorly understood—agency can be. Take the case of driverless cars, where there are difficult lines to draw around the boundaries of responsibility when things go wrong. When decision-making is shared, it raises hard questions about where goals come from and how they evolve. As systems begin to adapt, learn, and influence outcomes in ways no single human designed or predicted, we edge closer to the idea of open-ended agency—systems capable of defining their own objectives within ever-changing contexts. Unlike tools that follow predefined rules, these systems act more like organisms, responding to and reshaping their environments.\n\nUnlike tools that follow predefined rules, these systems act more like organisms, responding to and reshaping their environments.\n\nA real problem is that we lack a robust science of where and how novel goals originate. Emergent complexity—already challenging to study—becomes exponentially harder when it evolves into emergent goals. What competencies allow agents to define and pursue new goals? Where do these capabilities arise, and how can we understand them? It's an oxymoron to \"design\" such a truly agentic system. Such a system's behavior would be entirely contingent on its post-design experiences and learning.\n\nAnd when we are rethinking agency, we have to rethink accountability. Back to the driverless car—agency does not belong to a single actor but is shared across programmers, environmental feedback, predictive models, and the passengers themselves. Decisions emerge not from a singular mind but from the convergence of human and machine processes.\n\nBy recognizing that information and computation are the binding forces, we can begin to understand agency not as the property of individuals—human or machine—but as something that emerges from the system as a whole, contingent on the systems history. Yet this shift brings practical challenges: if agency is distributed across a human-machine system, who owns the outcomes? Who determines what matters, what’s meaningful, or what’s valuable? As AI increasingly shapes our cognition, attention, and memory, it doesn’t just influence what we do—it reshapes who we are.\n\nPerhaps the answers lie not in debating control but in rethinking the problem space of intelligence itself. Intelligence is often thought of as the ability to achieve goals within a defined space—but what if the space itself is dynamic and subject to transformation? In biology, transformations across \"morphospace\"—the landscape of possible forms and behaviors—are not hypothetical. They actually happen.\n\nA favorite example is the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly. The caterpillar dissolves its body and brain into an undifferentiated state, only to reorganize into a radically different creature. Its form, behavior, and environment shift entirely: from crawling on leaves in a 2D world to fluttering around in 3D space. Despite these profound changes, research suggests that some memories persist across these phases, serving as scaffolds for adaptation—a thread linking two vastly different embodiments of the same life.\n\nSo here's a key insight: intelligence is not static, and agency is not confined to a single form. Instead, both are defined by their ability to adapt and transform to navigate new spaces.\n\nWhat if AI could undergo similar transformations, reorganizing itself physically or computationally to explore new domains while retaining memory as a bridge across states? Such systems would not merely solve problems within predefined spaces but would redefine their operational boundaries, opening up new regions of morphospace to explore.\n\nWhat matters in this scenario is not just who is in control but what kind of transformations are possible and how they enable continuity across phases. Memory becomes more than a static record—it is a dynamic tool that supports adaptation in unfamiliar environments. By focusing on these transitions, we can better understand how intelligence—whether organic, synthetic, or hybrid—thrives not by rigidly adhering to a single state but by embracing change and reorganization in an open-ended manner.\n\nThe ethical implications of creating open-ended agents are complex and in no way easy to anticipate. Should we aim to build AI that simply aligns with and fulfills our goals, or do we want truly autonomous agents with the same open-ended intelligence—and potentially moral worth—that we recognize in humans and animals? The former prioritizes utility, while the latter invites the creation of trillions of new \"children\" with lives we cannot fully vouch for. Once these agents exist, they will have stakes and experiences of their own, fundamentally reshaping how we think about responsibility and coexistence.\n\nThe idea of machines having a moral stake in our \"society\" can feel like science fiction, but it emerges naturally when we think of agency as open-ended action and adaptation. This creates a deep conundrum—machines that operate purely according to our goals risk being limited, unable to adapt or innovate in ways that surprise us. Yet machines capable of defining their own goals—of truly open-ended agency—may act in ways that diverge from our intentions. The very quality that makes them powerful and autonomous also makes them unpredictable.\n\nYikes, machines that are maximally useful may need to act like independent agents, but in doing so, they may cease to align with what we want.\n\nCurrent legal and philosophical systems were not designed to accommodate minds that are radically different from ours. Our laws, which depend on anthropocentric notions of agency and intent, may crumble with AIs that can navigate entirely different spaces of intelligence and morality.\n\nShould we limit AI development to helpful tools that amplify human capacities, or should we embrace the inevitability of being supplanted by open-ended agents capable of far surpassing us? While some argue that improvements to our biology and intelligence are desirable, the creation of fully autonomous agents may take us beyond questions of enhancement into a territory of deep existential transformation.\n\nAnd it raises hard questions. If our decisions, creations, and even our sense of self are shaped by synthetic systems, what remains uniquely human? What do we want to collectively keep and what do we want to discard? What things haven’t served us well? What new spaces open up for us? What could be possible with an entirely different conception of intelligence and agency? If AI can open up entirely new spaces for human exploration and action, it represents a fundamental breakthrough—expanding not just what we can do, but how we think about and engage with reality.\n\nNext we consider how AI's \"other mindedness\" may impact how we conceive of reality itself.\n\nRethinking Reality\n\nFor most of our history, technology has served as a tool to open spaces and to reduce uncertainty, to clarify and sharpen our understanding of reality. Maps let us navigate unfamiliar terrain. Telescopes let us see the stars, expanding our vision to the vastness of the cosmos. Microscopes, in contrast, turned inward, revealing the hidden intricacies of the tiny and unseen. Computers cataloged and processed what we could not hold in memory. These tools made the world more legible, providing empirical and theoretical mechanisms to map patterns and refine predictions.\n\nAI doesn’t just clarify reality; it reshapes it, making it fluid, emergent, and dynamic.\n\nSynthetic systems compel us to reconceptualize reality. Why? Because we’re conditioned to see reality as something fixed—a stable, external truth waiting to be observed. But as you’ll discover, AI doesn’t just clarify reality; it reshapes it, making it fluid, emergent, and dynamic. Sara Walker, theoretical physicist and astrobiologist, reframes this shift. If life shapes its environment through information, AI’s pattern generation extends this principle—but without the meaning-making inherent to living systems.\n\nBy the end of this piece, we hope you’ll see how this shift challenges not only what we know but how we know, pushing us into a world where reality is something we co-create with the systems we build.\n\nThe Scientific Revolution reshaped how humanity understood reality, shifting it from a matter of belief to something observable and measurable. For the first time, reality was treated as an external, objective system governed by universal principles. Think of the scientific method as a kind of technology—a process designed to reduce uncertainty by systematically testing observations against reality. Reality expanded outward. With better tools, we gained sharper models, more accurate predictions, and an ever-expanding horizon of knowledge.\n\nBut this expansion has limits. The scientific method depends on a crucial assumption: that reality exists independently of the observer, as something measurable, testable, and ultimately objective. By bracketing subjectivity—removing the observer from the observation—science creates a space for external truths to emerge. But this assumption is starting to be challenged.\n\nAt the level of physical systems, quantum mechanics shows that observation cannot be cleanly separated from reality. The observer effect—illustrated by the double-slit experiment—reveals that the act of measurement changes the behavior of particles. Before being observed, a particle exists in a superposition of states, aka many possibilities. But the moment we measure it, the wave function collapses, and the particle \"chooses\" a single state.\n\nThis isn’t just a technical quirk—it points to a deeper principle which is that reality at its most fundamental level doesn’t exist in a fixed form independent of observation. The observer is not a bystander but a participant, entangled with the system being measured.\n\nConsciousness is more gnarly still—not an object to study but the subject of experience itself. As Descartes argued, the only certainty we can claim is that we are conscious—that we are experiencing. Think about what you know at this moment—the only thing you can know for sure is your experience of reading this right now. Science grapples with this problem. Consciousness exists at a boundary where objective study falters because the observer and the observed are inseparable.\n\nIf AI is now a participant in reality, does it alter reality itself?\n\nIf AI is now a participant in reality, does it alter reality itself? This question feels like it should belong in philosophy seminars or sci-fi novels, yet here we are, living it. To understand what this means, consider how AI functions not as a neutral tool, but as an actor. It identifies patterns and adjacencies humans might never perceive, generates insights that feel alien, and even shapes the decisions we make by influencing what we see and prioritize. But does this participation amount to a shift in the nature of reality, or just in how we perceive it?\n\nLet’s push deeper: reality, as science has framed it, is external and objective—a set of truths independent of who or what observes them. But AI’s participation complicates this. When an AI uncovers a pattern in data or generates a solution, it’s doing more than clarifying what’s “out there.” It’s adding something to the mix: a new way of slicing and interpreting reality. AI doesn’t just reflect the world as it is; it contributes new dimensions to what is possible. If it reveals paths that weren’t obvious or solutions that feel unnatural to us, is it expanding the boundaries of reality itself?\n\nHere’s where it gets tricky. AI doesn’t experience the world; it doesn’t feel uncertainty, wonder, or doubt. For humans, these are core to how we engage with reality—they drive us to ask questions, to imagine, to make meaning. AI skips the meaning part. For it, reality is just probabilities, data distributions, and optimization problems. But if AI’s “understanding” of reality diverges from ours—if its perspective shifts what we believe to be true—how do we reconcile the difference? And more provocatively, when AI outputs reshape what we notice, believe, and act upon, is it reshaping reality itself, or just nudging us into unfamiliar territories within it?\n\nThis isn’t just a technical question—it’s existential. When machines participate in the creation of “truth” or “knowledge,” they alter the framework within which humans understand the world. Reality becomes less about what is and more about what can be constructed, modeled, and acted upon. For us, this means adapting to a reality that is not fixed but fluid, co-created in part by systems that don’t share our subjective experience. And that raises the biggest question of all: if AI helps us see reality differently, how do we decide what still matters, what remains real, and where meaning comes from?\n\nAll this, and we haven’t even touched on the question of whether AI could ever be conscious—or perhaps even alive. That’s a rabbit hole for another time. For now, we’ve got plenty to chew on just grappling with how AI reshapes reality and what that means for the human experience.\n\nBy now we hope to have convinced you that our relationship with reality is going to become a lot more complex. Our tools—AI included—have expanded what we can perceive and predict. They map external systems, identify patterns invisible to us, and reduce uncertainty (that is, increase what we do know, what we can know, and how we know it) in ways that exceed our cognition. But they cannot cross this boundary. AI clarifies what is probable, but it does not experience uncertainty. For machines, the unknown is a problem to optimize. But for us, what we don't know is a source of meaning. This is when curiosity, ingenuity, and the drive for sensemaking kick in. The feeling of uncertainty drives us to interpret, imagine, and engage.\n\nThe paradox of consciousness reminds us that reality is not just \"out there\"; it is experienced. It is as much about subjectivity as it is about objectivity. Our tools may help us refine what we see, but they do not resolve the fundamental challenge: that the observer, inescapably, remains part of the equation.\n\nAI alters the boundaries of reality, making it more fluid and miscible. Machines don’t just clarify the world; they reveal what is adjacent, emergent, and sometimes alien. They expose patterns we never noticed, solutions we would never have imagined, and connections too subtle or complex for human cognition to grasp alone.\n\nThis raises an existential question: Is our cognition even up to the task? Just as my dog cannot fathom the concept of a stranger meeting me next week in the next town down the highway, we too may lack the perceptual tools to conceive of the full nature of reality.\n\nSo AI can't magically grant us mastery over how reality really is, but it could shift our perspective. It could show us that the world is far richer, stranger, and more layered than we are equipped to perceive. Ultimately AI won't only sharpen our understanding of what is, it will expand our awareness of what could be. So as it introduces new layers of reality, it will also destabilize it, pushing us into spaces we cannot perceive in any \"human-like\" way, let alone control.\n\nSo that's a lot to take in. Let's think nearer term. Ask yourself how you will feel the first time a machine’s sense of the “real” diverges from yours? When it uncovers a pattern or reveals an optimization that feels alien to your intuition? Questions like this matter because, in a hybrid future, the idea of “truth” or “reality” will be much more plastic. What it feels like to know something will undoubtedly change.\n\nThe realities that emerge from this dynamic are not guaranteed to be comfortable. Machines reveal what is adjacent—possibilities just beyond our current understanding—and sometimes what feels alien—novel and foreign. A machine might optimize in ways that are unintuitive, unsettling, or at odds with our values. It might identify efficiencies that challenge our cultural assumptions or expose solutions we find difficult to accept.\n\nThese “alien” perspectives aren't necessarily harmful. They remind us that reality isn't fixed. We're constantly toggling between humility and imagination. It means recognizing that machines offer not just tools for prediction but opportunities to rethink what is real, what is meaningful, and what is possible.\n\nThis won't be easy. Each of us will have to be adept at holding multiple truths in tension—at balancing machine-generated clarity with human ambiguity, and at interpreting the unfamiliar without rejecting it outright. This is where our unique relationship with uncertainty becomes a strength. Unlike machines, we are equipped to embrace ambiguity, to explore emergent spaces, and to create meaning in the midst of the unknown.\n\nReality, therefore, is not an external truth but something that emerges through interaction. Philosophers might argue that reality itself is unchanged, that these systems only alter how we know or perceive it. Yet for practical purposes, the line between perception and construction is thin. Because AI doesn't necessarily add clarity or a single \"truth\" but instead it participates in reshaping what we notice, what we believe, and what becomes possible. In this sense, reality remains both out there and in flux—co-created by the systems we build and the meanings we bring.\n\nThe real challenge is to resist the urge to preserve control but adapt to the fluidity of a new relationship. Machines may sharpen our understanding of what is, but it is our role to define what matters. The world will be richer, stranger, and more open-ended than ever before—a world where resolving what is real to each of us—individually and collectively—is the very source of life’s creativity and meaning.",

      "# ['Maybe we need less engineers...': Sam Altman just spelled out a chilling future for techies by Business Today Desk on 2025-03-22](https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/maybe-we-need-less-engineers-sam-altman-just-spelled-out-a-chilling-future-for-developers-468860-2025-03-22)\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman says the AI his company is building might eventually reduce the need for software engineers. Not immediately but the direction is clear. “Each software engineer will just do much, much more for a while,” he said. “And then at some point, yeah, maybe we do need less software engineers.”\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with Stratechery's Ben Thompson, Altman, 39, said the tactical edge once came from mastering code. Now, it’s all about mastering AI.\n\n“The obvious tactical thing is just get really good at using AI tools,” he said, contrasting it with the early 2000s when the goal was simply to be a good coder.\n\nAltman revealed that in many companies, “at least half” of code is already written by AI. “I think in many companies, it's probably past 50% now,” he said, adding that the next leap—“agentic coding”—is still on the horizon.\n\n“The big thing I think will come with agentic coding, which no one's doing for real yet.”\n\nHe’s not alone. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently said AI will write all software code within a year. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg echoed that in January, telling Joe Rogan that AI will soon be generating much of the code behind their apps.\n\nSridhar Vembu, founder of Zoho, isn’t surprised. In a recent post on X, he wrote, “When people say ‘AI will write 90% of the code’ I readily agree because 90% of what programmers write is ‘boiler plate’.”\n\nHe drew on a distinction from The Mythical Man-Month, calling it the gap between “essential complexity” and “accidental complexity.”\n\n“AI is doing a great job eliminating the accidental complexity. Humans still need to deal with the essential complexity,” Vembu explained.\n\nBut he also flagged a boundary AI may not cross: “Can it find totally new patterns?... I don’t know if AI can do this. I don’t know if that can be brute forced.”",

      "# [Kevin Kelly on Jazzyear's Tech Talk: The AI Predictions I've Never Revealed](https://www.jazzyear.com/article_info.html?id=1322)\n\"Slower than it looks; LLMs tend average; Not replacing humans; New, not substitutions; Cloud first, then AI; Must change your org; Just beginning... These seven predictions are not exhaustive. Could you share some insights that haven't been mentioned elsewhere?\" I asked KK.\n\nKevin Kelly, affectionately known as \"KK\" among tech enthusiasts, paused for at least 30 seconds after removing his glasses. Then, after a few rounds of prolonged questions, he abruptly cut me off.\n\n\"My prediction is that, in 10 years, training data won't be important,\" Kelly declared.\n\nProbably the nearest thing Silicon Valley has to a true sage, Kelly is a visionary figure in the tech world. Known for his bushy beard and graying hair, he has authored seminal works such as \"Out of Control,\" \"What Technology Wants,\" and \"The Inevitable\". Kelly has also long been celebrated for his prescient insights into future trends, having accurately forecasted developments like cloud computing, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things three decades ago.\n\nDuring his visit to Suzhou, China to participate in a Tech Lecture Series organized by Suzhou Institute of Science and Technology and the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance at Shanghai Jiao Tong University on June 16,2024, our conversation took place following his lecture, which stretched from the planned 20 minutes to nearly an hour.\n\nIn this conversation, Miss. Jia, founder and CEO of the prominent Chinese tech think-tank Jazzyear, discussed with Kelly of his recent observations, AI innovations, and the fundamental nature of humanity.\n\nDespite minor differences in specific viewpoints, both Kelly and Miss.Jia agree on a central theme: the transformative impact of AI on the world is just beginning.\n\nRecent events: “It's my full time.”\n\n“You have to have 1,000 hours. Maybe I’ve had 800 hours, not 1,000 hours.”\n\nMiss. Jia: News comes and goes, and the attitude towards AI has changed a lot around the world, especially people's views on AI 2.0, AGI or big models. How much time have you devoted to tracking cutting-edge AI progress？\n\nKevin Kelly: It's my full time. All I do is just to read the AI papers.\n\nMiss. Jia: Whose papers do you like most?\n\nKevin Kelly: Well, every day there's a new paper, a new article every hour maybe ,with some discovery about LLM. Just last week there was a paper, an article from Anthropic, on being able to illuminate the weights and try to nudge. it was this idea that there are black boxes. We don't know how they think. They're saying, well, actually, we could see into them a little bit. That was very interesting.\n\nMiss. Jia: Would you try Midjourney or something yourself?\n\nKevin Kelly: Give one a day for a year.\n\nMiss. Jia: Now you are an AI native.\n\nKevin Kelly: Kind of halfway. I don't think I have 1,000 hours yet. You have to have 1,000 hours. Maybe I’ve had 800 hours, not 1,000 hours.\n\nMiss. Jia: You are a philosopher in the field of technology. Has your philosophy of technology been interrupted or changed in the recent wave of AI?\n\nKevin Kelly: That's a good question. I don't think my philosophy about technology has changed. I would say it has confirmed my philosophy. I haven't seen anything that maybe changed my mind about the development, my theory of technology. So I have a theory of technology and that theory is that it's like evolution and nothing I've seen in AI has changed my theory of technology.\n\nPerspective: \"I’m concerned about the weaponization of AI\"\n\nWhat are the best and worst decisions made by OpenAI?\n\nMiss. Jia: There is a line at the top of your official website: OVER THE LONG TERM, THE FUTURE IS DECIDED BY OPTIMISTS. Are you worried about the recent wave of AI progress and rapid iterations, as well as the century-long human identity crisis you just mentioned?\n\nKevin Kelly: In general, I'm not worried too much. There are some things I would say I am concerned about, but I believe that we will solve those problems. Climate change. It's a problem, but we know what to do.\n\nThere are other kind of problems like in AI, but we don't know how to solve it. Questions like the weaponization, or should we have a robot soldier? Should we have AI been able to kill? It's a really hard thing to this. So those are the kinds of things that I'm concerned about. The weaponization of AI.\n\nI think I'm also concerned about whether AI is open or closed, whether it's public or just owned by corporations. I think it should be public.\n\nMiss. Jia: You think it should be public？\n\nKevin Kelly: Yes, public in the sense of open source.So that's another concern.\n\nMiss. Jia: Are you still the optimist?\n\nKevin Kelly: Yes, I'm very optimistic. I think we will solve this,but I don't know how, and I don't think they're impossible to solve. So I'm very optimistic.\n\nI think there are some things that people worry about that I don't worry about. Like unemployment. I'm not worried about that. Also, I'm not worried about the AIs gonna kill us. I'm not worried about that either.\n\nMiss. Jia: You have fans all over the world, and you must know many great scientist friends. Do they agree with your views on AI, or are there more opponents?\n\nKevin Kelly: I Think that's interesting right now, there's a big disagree. There's two camps about the Super AI, those who are worried, and those are not. There are a lot of really good scientists who are worried. There's a lot of good scientists who are not worried. It's interesting. There's two different beliefs about the power of a super intelligence AI. I'm in the camp that is not worried about it.\n\nMiss. Jia: I have a more specific question now. What are the best and worst decisions made by OpenAI so far?\n\nKevin Kelly: OpenAI should have made their models open. They didn't. OpenAI is not open. They should make it open. That was the worst decision. I think another worst decision was firing Sam.\n\nTheir best decision is their choices to keep speeding, making it faster, to innovate faster and faster, to rehiring Sam and then committing to not be so careful and really try and grow fast.\n\nBoundary: \"AI is good at hill climbing, not hill making\"\n\n\"You can get a Midjourney or Dall-E to make a famous astronaut riding a horse, but you can't get it to have a horse riding an astronaut.\"\n\nMiss. Jia: You mentioned two types of creativity, type 1 and type 2, and you drew a very interesting picture saying that AI is good at hill climbing, not hill making. What is the difference?\n\nKevin Kelly: The kind of creativity that the LLMs that they operate within the boundaries of what's known. They're kind of exploring everything within that space of what I know. They're not inventing whole new territory. So breakthroughs basically are making up new territories rather than exploiting of finding solutions within an existing term. And mostly what they're doing right now is finding answers within what we, imagining pictures within the boundaries of what we know. That's why it's really hard. You can get a Midjourney or Dall-E to make a famous astronaut riding a horse, but you can't get it to have a horse riding an astronaut cuz it's outside of.\n\nMiss. Jia: Are you a fan of the Scaling law?\n\nKevin Kelly: Yes, there is some. So to explain to the audience, the scaling law is saying that there is a mathematical proportion train how big the model gets, and the loss factor and how close it can become to maximizing the results.\n\nSo far, it seems like the scaling law works. When they add compute at the training size, it gets the performance gets better. What we don't know is whether that is indefinite. Can I continue forever? Does it plateau? I think the evidence suggests that it will plateau. That's not the Internet.\n\nMiss. Jia: There is an opinion that has been very popular in the AI industry recently - It's all about dataset, not so much with the algorithm or some other method, only the dataset is important.\n\nKevin Kelly: There was a paper, an article saying that the quality of data had more influence than the algorithms. And I believe that's very possible.\n\nI would predict that we're going to see AI companies advertise the AI is based on the training data. So you will have people say, we didn't train our algos or this stuff. We trained only on the best. We trained it on high quality books and other high quality materials. We didn't train on Reddit.\n\nIt's like education. If you have a child, how you gonna educate them? You're gonna have them read Twitter or you're gonna have them read the classics? There'll be some people say our AI only read the classics. They read the highest quality books and scientific journals. They weren't reading Reddit or Twitter, or Weibo. They were reading good stuff. They were trained on the best. And there will be some people who will sell their AI on this idea of curating the training data. Just yesterday, Getty was gonna have an AI image generator that was only trained on the Getty library.\n\nPrediction: \"In 10 years now, training data won't be important\"\n\nDoing reasoning without needing to have millions of examples.\n\nMiss. Jia: Your fame comes largely from your identity as a prophet, but you just flashed big words on the screen: No predictions. But you mentioned seven judgments:\n\nSlower than it looks\n\nLLMs tend average\n\nNot replacing humans\n\nNew, not substitutions\n\nCloud first, then AI\n\nMust change your org\n\nJust beginning\n\nThese seven predictions are not exhaustive. Could you share some insights that haven't been mentioned elsewhere?\n\nKevin Kelly: (long pause) Generally, if I have an idea, I tell people. But let's have a conversation, and then I will try to come up with one.\n\n(continued pause) So about AI, tell me about AI in China. I don't know very much about AI in China. You obviously are reading papers. What would you say is happening in China right now in terms of AI?\n\nMiss. Jia: I think the similarities between China and the United States are much greater than people think.\n\nKevin Kelly: The similarities？What happened？\n\nMiss. Jia: For example, talent. There are many young talents in China, they are students or in startups. They are very similar to the young talents I met in the United States or some other countries, because AI is so sharp and so new.\n\nMy major is mathematics. When we compare AI and mathematics, the length of history is different. Many friends around me think that artificial intelligence is too complex and difficult to understand. But the history of AI is only more than half a century. If you just want to understand the overview, history, and subject classification, reading two or three books is enough for you to build a basic overview of AI. China may not have big names like Elon Musk or Sam Altman, but when you look around at young talents, the grounds are quite similar.\n\nThe second dimension is data. Maybe China have some advantages.\n\nKevin Kelly: Who has access to data? A young startup, would they have access to that data?\n\nMiss. Jia: I think we are just getting started. The government is trying to build the infrastructure for people to get the data they want in a good way.\n\nKevin Kelly: What does that mean, good way?\n\nMiss. Jia: Data market. You know, data has been written into fundamental policies and has become a factor, just like capital, labor, technology, and land, which are called \"factors of production\" in China.\n\nKevin Kelly: Your entrepreneurs will not have any difficulty getting data?\n\nMiss. Jia: They can get data as easy as they can get data in other countries, maybe easier. But I think that there are a lot of problems or challenges they have to face. The biggest challenge is not policy, not authority, but datasets. Datasets for various languages are different.\n\nKevin Kelly: So here's a prediction. My prediction is that in 10 years now, training data won't be important.\n\nAll the large language models require scaling huge methods of data. But there are other kinds of cognition intelligence. A human toddler can tell the difference between a cat and dog after seeing 12 examples. They don't need 12 million. So I think in 10 years, we'll have abilities of doing reasoning without needing to have millions of examples. And that was a huge advantage to startups at all because they don't need to have all that data.\n\nEssence: \"Consciousness made us special, then we give consciousness to AIs.\"\n\nCo-discovering what it means to be human with AI.\n\nMiss. Jia: Can you give me some insights into your essence of human beings and artificial intelligence?\n\nKevin Kelly: That's the thing is. We don't know what the essence of human is. The way we're gonna find out is by making AIs. We will make an AI and we will make it creative and we'll realize, oh, we thought creativity was what made us special, but now we changed our mind because AIs can be created too. And we'll say, well, we thought consciousness was what made us special. Then we'll give consciousness to AIs.\n\nMiss. Jia: Where will this \"giving\" process end?\n\nKevin Kelly: We'll constantly redefining ourselves because of technology and AI. And I think the more important question, it's not like who are we, but who we want to become. What would we like humans to be? That's a more powerful question, because we get to kind of choose that a little bit, deciding what it is. That's what's exciting about, for me, that's the ultimate excitement about AI, that it's illuminating who we are, as well as inspiring us to who we could become.\n\nMiss. Jia: Accelerated computing is touching the no-man's land of science. What is the limit of this path?\n\nKevin Kelly: We don't have the theory of intelligence, we don't have the theory of humans. We can't prodict where AI is going cuz we have no theory about AI. If you do this, your theories have predictions. If you do this, then this will happen. If you add all this compute, then you'll get this. We don't have any theory, which is unusual.\n\nIn physics, we have theories. If you make a big enough collider, you'll find this particle. We don't have that for intelligence right now. But I think that's what's exciting is that we're, with AI co-discovering what it means to be human.\n\nMiss.Jia: Thank you. I do like your answers.\n\nKevin Kelly: I like your questions.\n\nKevin Kelly (right) and Miss.

      "# [App Monetization Strategies: Maximizing Revenue for Your Mobile Application by Jissa Dshgsonic on 2024-09-19](https://dshgsonic.com/app-monetization-strategies-maximizing-revenue-for-your-mobile-application/)\nMonetizing your mobile application can be daunting, but it doesn’t have to be. You can turn your mobile app into a powerful revenue generator with the right strategies and platforms. In this post, we’ll take an in-depth look at how to maximize monetization potential for any application through building user engagement, optimizing ad placement, implementing subscription models, establishing an e-commerce presence, and more. Armed with these tactics and the right mobile monetization platform, you’ll soon see that devoting time to driving app revenue is well worth it.\n\nKeep reading for full details on boosting earnings from your app today!\n\nTable of content\n\nIdentify and target your audience\n\nCreate an in-app purchasing system for virtual goods or services\n\nUtilize subscription models to ensure regular payments from users\n\nIncorporate advertisements into the user experience to capture revenue\n\nUse data analysis to optimize pricing and maximize revenue potential\n\nAnalyze feedback from customers and use it to improve the user experience and increase motivation for ongoing payment\n\n1. Identify and target your audience\n\nUnderstanding your audience is crucial when building an app. Afterall, if you don’t know who your users are or what they need, how can you create a product that meets their expectations? By identifying and targeting your audience, you can tailor your app to meet their specific needs and preferences. Whether you’re creating a fitness app for health enthusiasts or a cooking app for busy parents, understanding who your users are and what they require from your app will not only make them happy, but it will also increase the chances of success for your app. By putting in the effort to truly understand your audience, you’ll be able to create a product that resonates with them and keep them coming back time and time again.\n\n2. Create an in-app purchasing system for virtual goods or services\n\nIn today’s digital age, virtual goods and services have become increasingly popular among consumers. As a result, it is essential for businesses to offer an in-app purchasing system for their virtual products to make the transaction process even more seamless for their customers. Implementing such a system allows users to easily browse and buy items, whether they are virtual goods like skins or in-game rewards or services like digital content creation tools. This not only creates a more efficient user experience but also provides a pathway for businesses to generate revenue. With an in-app purchasing system, companies have the possibility of capitalizing on the growth of the virtual industry while providing a convenient service to their customers.\n\n3. Utilize subscription models to ensure regular payments from users\n\nSubscription models have become increasingly popular in recent years, allowing businesses to generate a reliable source of income through regular payments from users. By offering customers a subscription, companies can create a regular revenue stream that improves financial stability and enables better long-term planning. The benefits of utilizing subscription models are not limited to the business only – customers often appreciate the predictability of charges, the flexibility to switch plans, and special promotions available only to subscribers. With the rise of online services and e-commerce, subscription models have evolved beyond news and entertainment content to include a variety of products and services. Companies that adopt subscription-based models open up new possibilities for business growth and the potential to transform entire industries.\n\n4. Incorporate advertisements into the user experience to capture revenue\n\nAs the digital world continues to evolve, finding creative ways to generate revenue has become a top priority for many businesses. A trend that has gained popularity over the years is incorporating advertisements into the user experience. This seamless integration not only provides a revenue source but also allows brands to reach their target audience in a more organic way. By understanding the user’s behavior and preferences, businesses can deliver personalized ads that align with their interests. Advertisements within the user experience create a win-win situation, where users can access free content while companies can capitalize on their reach. As long as the ads don’t interrupt the user experience, it’s a strategy worth exploring.\n\n5. Use data analysis to optimize pricing and maximize revenue potential\n\nOne solution to improving pricing strategies is data analysis. By analyzing data, businesses can understand consumer behavior, preferences, and patterns that can help optimize pricing for maximum revenue potential. Data analysis not only helps identify the ideal price point but also enables an understanding of the elasticity of demand, which can further aid in pricing decisions. Ultimately, data analysis allows companies to align their pricing strategies with market trends and gain a competitive edge. Gone are the days of guesswork in pricing strategies; now, data analysis is helping businesses make informed decisions that maximize revenue.\n\n6. Analyze feedback from customers and use it to improve the user experience and increase motivation for ongoing payment\n\nListening to your customers is key to improving the user experience and motivating them to keep paying for your product or service. By analyzing their feedback, you gain valuable insight into how they are using your product and what they love or dislike about it. This information can be used to make necessary improvements, address pain points, and create a better overall experience for your users. Not only will this improve customer satisfaction, but it will increase their motivation to continue using your product and make ongoing payments, ultimately benefiting your business in the long run. So, take the time to listen and learn from your customers’ feedback – it’s a win-win the situation for both sides.\n\nSummary\n\nAll in all, there are many strategies available to maximize revenue for a mobile application and monetize its content. Research is key to finding the best methods that fit the type of app being created. App monetization must also remain within the boundaries of each app’s respective legal framework. Furthermore, it is important to adjust and optimize monetization strategies as the market changes, implementing insights from user analytics and stakeholder feedback.
