I have 2 hyperparameters to tune and assuming each parameter could take on roughly 6 orders of magnitude, then I would have to run my network 36 times to find the best hyperparameters given this grid search. This would take me over a month to perform! This seems quite long.\n\nI see a lot of papers doing hyperparameter tuning. Do they have smaller networks that can train faster? Is some trick used to speed up the search process?\n\n## Comment ID ir0zlg1 with +105 score by [(ButthurtFeminists, Reddit, 2022-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xvem36/d_how_do_you_go_about_hyperparameter_tuning_when/ir0zlg1/) (in reply to ID xvem36):\nIm surprised this one hasnt been mentioned already. \n\nLong training could be due to model complexity and/or dataset size. Therefore, you could use a subset of your dataset if it's difficult to downscale your model. For example, let's say I'm training a Resnet152 model on ImageNet - if I wanted to reduce training time for hyperparameters, I could sample a subset of Imagenet (maybe 1/10 the size) and tune hyperparams on that, then test the best hyperparameter on the full dataset.\n\n### Comment ID ir1dktk with +17 score by [(bphase, Reddit, 2022-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xvem36/d_how_do_you_go_about_hyperparameter_tuning_when/ir1dktk/) (in reply to ID ir0zlg1):\nWouldn't it be more beneficial to just perform 1/10 the steps or epochs? No need to use a subset of data, just train for less time. End result is you won't get the best performance anyways.\n\n#### Comment ID ir1h1ir with +17 score by [(ButthurtFeminists, Reddit, 2022-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xvem36/d_how_do_you_go_about_hyperparameter_tuning_when/ir1h1ir/) (in reply to ID ir1dktk):\nThis could work as well, but there may be slight differences - it's inherently harder to converge training on larger datasets.

Train fully with that. Then double it for the same hyperparameters and see how the performance changes. You want to stop when the performance no longer changes significantly after doubling the data.\n\nHow much is significantly? Well, I would personally stop when doubling the data doesn't halve the test error. But that criterion is arbitrary, so ymmv, and you should adjust it based on how fast it increases. Think of what performance would be acceptable for an average person who is neither stupid, nor informed enough to know your model could be much better. You just need enough data to consider your hyperparameters representative.\n\nIf you do not know how to tune that, then try clustering your data strictly. Ex., if you have text, you could divide it into 2-grams, use MinHashes and then say the threshold for a cluster is 1% similarity. This will give you very few clusters from which you can pick the representative and use that as a sample for your dev test.\n\nSearch your hyperparameters randomly within a distribution when you reach those diminishing returns and then train with those hyperparameters on the full dataset. Depending on the network the diminishing returns point will be anywhere from 1k (CV resnets) to 100k samples (finetuning transformers).\n\n## Comment ID ir1b0gg with +4 score by [(HennesTD, Reddit, 2022-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xvem36/d_how_do_you_go_about_hyperparameter_tuning_when/ir1b0gg/) (in reply to ID xvem36):\nI don't quite get the idea behind training on a smaller subset of the data, although it might be just that it doesn't work in my case. \n\nIn my specific case I tried training an ASR model on Librispeech. \nTraining it on 1/10th of the Librispeech 360h data gave me pretty much the exact same loss curve in the first hours of training.

So, I have developed a strategy that is working reasonably well.\n\nFirst, I work with image data and I always start by training and evaluating models at a lower resolution. For example, if I were using the CelebA-HQ dataset I would do all initial development with 128x128 images, then scale up the resolution once my results are good. Often times things translate reasonably well when scaling up and this allows for much more rapid prototyping.\n\nAnother strategy that has worked well for me is fine tuning. I train a base model with “best guess” hyperparameters to completion. Then I fine tune for a quarter of the total training time, modifying one hyperparameter of interest while keeping everything else the same. For my work, this amount of time has been enough to see the effects of the changes and to determine clear winners. In a few cases, I have been able to verify my fine tuning results by training the model from scratch under the different configurations - this is what gives me confidence in the approach. I find that this strategy still works when I have hyperparemeters which impact one another; holding one constant and optimizing the other works pretty well to balance them.\n\nI should note that you probably don’t need to tune most hyperparameters, unless it is one you are adding. If it isn’t something novel I feel like there is bound to be a reference in the literature that has what you’re looking for. This is worth keeping in mind, I think. \n\nOverall, it’s not really worth going to great lengths to tune things unless your results are really bad or you’re being edged out by a competitor. However, if your results are really bad that probably speaks to a larger issue.\n\n## Comment ID ir0n1dy with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xvem36/d_how_do_you_go_about_hyperparameter_tuning_when/ir0n1dy/) (in reply to ID xvem36):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID ir0uhh2 with +3 score by [(twocupv60, Reddit, 2022-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xvem36/d_how_do_you_go_about_hyperparameter_tuning_when/ir0uhh2/) (in reply to ID ir0n1dy):\nYour very last thought seems the most reasonable.

Tune a smaller network, then apply the hyperparameters to the larger one and 'hope for the best'.\n2. As others have said, train less, for example, 10 epochs rather than 100. I typically find this produces the wrong results though (the best performer is often poor early on)\n3. For low dim (2d) perform a very coarse grid search (space samples an order of magnitude apart, maybe two), then use just the best model. This is often the best method as you don't want to overtune the hyperparameters.\n4. For high dim, just use random search, then marginalize over all but one parameter using the mean of the best 5-runs. This works really well.\n5. If the goal is often to compare two methods rather than to maximize the score, you can use other people's hyperparameters. \n6. Baysian optimization is usually not worth the time. In small dims do grid search, in large do random search.\n7. If you have the resources then train your models in parallel. This is a really easy way to make use of multiple GPUs if you have them.\n8. In some cases you can perform early stopping for models which are clearly not working. I try not to do this though.\n9. When I do HPS I'm doing it on another dataset than my main one.

Building a platform based on Docker to host our models and integrating with various applications.

I'd recommend at least 3-4 years of solid development experience in python before even considering a role like such. But that's just the programming. You'll need to be an expert in systems, math, and pretty good with business as well.\n\nIt's worth it. Not only are you at the top tier of engineering talent - but you can literally work at any company in nearly every industry. Don't like where you're at? Leave - walk into a new job next week. The job security and pay is unparalleled. You'll work like a madman to get here, but when you do, the benefits are nice.\n\nLet's get into the details - \n\nYou'll need to understand how parallelization/synchronization and mutithreading work. You'll also need to have some understanding of systems at scale: distributed architectures/databases and interprocess communication and the nuances of both.\n\nAs a physicist, you'll have the upper hand in understanding the functions which describe deep learning, since you'll be able to read the papers and understand the math.\n\nTensorflow and Keras make it pretty easy to get started with ML engineering. You'll learn more as you encounter problems you'll need to solve on projects.\n\nAs a working ML engineer, your work is dictated by the current project. There is no typical 9-5 as the workflow for model development changes as the project needs change. \n\nWorking as a consultant and in specialized data science teams, here's how it goes:\n\n\\- someone comes up with a problem to solve. This problem may warrant some advanced ML, but 75% of the time, it can be solved with simple models or even basic statistical analysis. Someone heard that AI was going to fix their shitty business processes without them having to do any work and need you to be the magician\n\n\\- You'll work to gather data. The data is almost always poor quality and you'll spend a good deal of time working with application developers and the engineers who built the systems to understand the data and the issues. Datasets in the real world are filled with fields like \"crhp\\_342\". If you're lucky, someone knows what that means. Most of the time, no.\n\n\\- You'll spend a lot of time trying to simplify explanations to people who don't understand anything about what you're doing. Best case: they leave you to work and deliver, and you do. The clients or business is led by smart, capable people who understand. Worst case: you're micromanaged by someone much dumber than you who thinks they understand the math, but don't. You spend a lot of time trying to play nice while gritting your teeth. If you're talented, and in a situation like this, leave. Either way, you'll need to master Feynman's techniques for simplifying complex math into easy to understand explanations. \n\n\\- You may build datapipelines for models you've developed. This requires an understanding of how to effectively move data from web systems to databases. There are a lot of frameworks out there to use\n\n\\- You'll also need to understand operating systems, specifically linux. Many jobs and models need to be scheduled on multiple machines. Tools like docker help.\n\nI hope this doesn't sound cynical, because when it's done right and the team is good, it's nerdvana. You spend days theorizing with brilliant people who can also execute at the same or even better than you. You learn more in a month than your average person learns in a few years.\n\nPeople are typically the worst part of this job. I can imagine that it's different working at deepmind or vicarious or any of the other AI thinktanks. I haven't had the experience, and have worked with some of the largest (non-silicon valley) companies in the world.\n\n### Comment ID eyn68ue with +1 score by [(Studyr3ddit, Reddit, 2019-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/cxhvbd/d_what_is_the_reality_of_machine_learning_engineer/eyn68ue/) (in reply to ID eylt82u):\n> I hope this doesn't sound cynical, because when it's done right and the team is good, it's nerdvana.

Of course this also involves a fair bit of programming but as I deal with the same type of data (Audio) our data cleaning and preprocessing is either mostly done or dealt with by signal processing people.\n\nInterestingly, while you find dozens of \"switch from software dev to data science\", you basically find none for the other direction.\nBut to be honest, while it's great that you always got the feeling that someone is working even while you're sleeping, it can be quite frustrating.\n\nSoftware development is like being a dictator. ML is like being a shepard trying to get a herd of mentally handicapped sheep to do your bidding. You check back after 2 days and most likely lot went wrong. Even worse, you often don't know why and start tuning hyperparameters like a money on steroids. Papers often just add this or that Lego brick to the architectures without much reasoning. Because it worked after hundreds of experiments.\nOnly that it stops working when you get to the next dataset.\n\nGenerative models are even worse because the loss function not necessarily fully correlates with human perception. So that really nice loss might be utter crap and again, you don't know why. So you not only check train and valid error but also have to manually check the 50 models you trained.\nseq2seq models often rely on teacher forcing during training. Without ground truth aligned data fed to the autoregression you are probably unable to get a meaningful loss. At the same time if you don't do teacher forcing the loss probably becomes completely useless as the resulting sequence might be 5 frames longer and perfectly fine for us humans but a catastrophe for the loss function.\n\nOK that was a detour. Software dev also got such frustrating aspects. But generally I roughly know why stuff fails or at least am able to figure it out. After more than 3 years with deep learning (and more than 10 development before that) I really enjoy whenever I can again just develop stuff and I know it will (mostly) work. It gradually grows and gets better.\nThose models on the other hand are still playing tricks on me all the time. The probabilistic work also means there is no 100%. Many non-tech people don't understand that. If there is a self driving car issue they call it a \"programming error\". Even if there is no correct answer. \n\nOf course,this all still beats working through business application tickets and writing unit tests by a large margin ;). But the feeling of achievement is often missing. I suddenly have a nice model because I set hyperparam x to 0.01 instead of 0.02, not because I did such a good work. In that regards I'm really looking forward to  AutoML style of work and also looking into probabilistic programming.\n\n### Comment ID f7bog45 with +1 score by [(BallJiggler, Reddit, 2019-11-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/cxhvbd/d_what_is_the_reality_of_machine_learning_engineer/f7bog45/) (in reply to ID eynljkx):\nWhat is your job title exactly?

To that end, day-to-day will be more general software engineering rather than \"getting into the weeds\" with ML. That said, whatever statistical background will definitely help with understanding things; the roles tend to blend into each other a bit anyway.\n\nIn small cos, the divisions of roles are generally similar but you'll probably have higher variance, with more in-between bleeding between these. \n\nRegardless of any of this, don't sell yourself short. Most (good) places don't actually care what your formal background was if you show that you can do the work. I've seen plenty of people with formal CS backgrounds get rejected after interviewing and people without (including those with physics backgrounds) get offers -- if you're worried about not having the right skills but are interested in the area, that sounds like a great opportunity for you to put some effort into learning some new interesting things. :)\n\n## Comment ID eylbzuj with +7 score by [(JustOneAvailableName, Reddit, 2019-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/cxhvbd/d_what_is_the_reality_of_machine_learning_engineer/eylbzuj/) (in reply to ID cxhvbd):\nI would recomend checking out books/small courses before actually figuring out if you want to switch careers.

It is completly free. He says always that it so important that non developers are getting into Deep Learning because they have ideas where problems are and with this course they can solve them. \nIf you are a physics then you will be able to do the math. In ML you work with matrices and some optimization math. It isn't that spooky ;) \nIf you do the course, maybe you should do a tutorial about python. But as well python isn't that big of a deal. \nMaybe you just reduce your working hours to 30 hours and learn ML yourself. The internet has so good tutorials, blogs and you don't need to go back to school for that. I am at university and I learned more with the stuff on the internet than in my courses ;) \nIf you have done these courses than it is important to have some practice. So go for challenges, read the winning paper, try these codes (most of them are on GitHub) and do some transfer learning.

Then, make the model predict things that are useful for solving that task, with as much entropy as is still useful for your task.\n\nIf your data is invariable, change your task. If your task is invariable, get more data (with less entropy).\n\n### Comment ID id3vhxu with +14 score by [(gangstalf_the_grey, Reddit, 2022-06-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vgoc1h/d_in_your_experience_whats_the_thing_that_can/id3vhxu/) (in reply to ID id3ozjy):\nI understand your point and it makes sense given the particular example but isn't the point of the training to reduce the uncertainty towards a certain task by also learning latent patterns?\n\nIn your example there exist unmodeled external factors at play which influence the feature you are using in an unknown fashion. If you have also e.g the presence of clouds as a feature wouldn't the training reduce the entropy by also modeling the relationship between your 2 features?\n\nWhat I am getting at is how in a complicated setting would you make a decision on whether the entropy is reduced since in realistic scenarios you might have a large number of features, many of which might not even be easily interpretable. \n\nIf the dl paradigm had shown anything is that latent patterns are common but can only be leveraged given enough clean data or bigger model or more epochs of training or a combination of the above.\n\n#### Comment ID id4fwh7 with +7 score by [(jan_antu, Reddit, 2022-06-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vgoc1h/d_in_your_experience_whats_the_thing_that_can/id4fwh7/) (in reply to ID id3vhxu):\nThis is an incredible well said point, and basically the crux of the issue\n\nI do think that the addition of another feature here, like say cloudiness, could help. You end up with a prediction that doesn't claim to have any information about clouds, so you are at least ending up with a prediction that specifies less than the training data. Of course you have to balance the addition of new features with the risk of overfitting.\n\nHowever this is a toy example, mostly just to illustrate the point. Typically, as you say, in the DL environment you have:\n\n-\tmore data than you can realistically inspect as a human\n-\tenough features, often abstracted ones, to make interpretation difficult\n-\ta long delay before you get enough real-world validation to know if your mode works well\n\nAll of this makes the process of estimating entropy levels very difficult. There is no solid answer I can give you... personally I have had the most success from being extremely overzealous about it. \n\nFor example, rather than having a model to predict the affinity between a small molecule and a protein, I will use it to rank a population of small molecules. So much information is lost in the transition between rank-order list and individual prediction of affinity, you end up with a much safer final prediction from a usability standpoint. If you are intending to use these predictions to say, hypothetically, optimize a ligand to bind a protein via an evolutionary algorithm, then actually you don't **need** anything more than the rank order list of all the candidates. \n\nSo then this is what affords you the most opportunity: you can actually use a different metric to measure model performance, which is based on your higher-entropy final task.\n\nConceptually it's somewhere between reducing your risk of over-interpreting the results (minimizing the risk of overfitting), and \"hiding\" the inherent mistakes your model makes. \n\nUltimately however, I find it's best to think of it as what I call the \"Entropy Ladder\". At every stage, from data, to preprocessing, to training, to validation, etc, you need to ensure that total entropy is always increasing. Otherwise you are absolutely introducing errors.\n\nNo matter how much data you have, how long you train, or how big your model is, nothing will change the fact that your model is inherently a *summary* of the data. At best, it's a summary of the data *landscape*, which may contain implicit information that isn't overtly in the training dataset. If I’m understanding correctly this is what you mean by *latent patterns*. In this case, there is no magic entropy reduction, it's just that your overall dataset likely has more information and more *meaning* than is being captured by the model. This is best exemplified by a simple fact: you would be 100% unable to reproduce your original dataset using only your model, with 100% confidence and precision.\n\nSo, I make these decisions with care, from experience, aggressively in favor of increasing entropy when in doubt, and with the knowledge that I’m likely still making a mistake. More often than not it works out surprisingly well.\n\n### Comment ID id40l3y with +8 score by [(C_BearHill, Reddit, 2022-06-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vgoc1h/d_in_your_experience_whats_the_thing_that_can/id40l3y/) (in reply to ID id3ozjy):\nCan you explain what you mean by entropy in this context?\n\n#### Comment ID id4d7zj with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-06-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vgoc1h/d_in_your_experience_whats_the_thing_that_can/id4d7zj/) (in reply to ID id40l3y):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID id3fhar with +14 score by [(pilooch, Reddit, 2022-06-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vgoc1h/d_in_your_experience_whats_the_thing_that_can/id3fhar/) (in reply to ID vgoc1h):\nOK, data data data everyone is saying, that's kinda true, but most often you can't get more.\n\nSo don't under estimate carefully crafted architectures, especially for very specialized applications like GANs, GNNs, time series.

These are linear values from \\[0, 24) or \\[0, 60). We converted both of them into coordinates in an x,y plane on a clock. So the hour became a coordinate, same for minute. Why? Because 0:01 is right next to 23:59, but on an integer scale these are extremely far apart, but in reality they are right next to each other. We wanted to capture that they are close, so the model could generally learn things that happen say near that time boundary.\n\nThe numeric representation creates an boundary in the data that doesn't exist in reality, and this feature enhancement technique removes it from the dataset.\n\nStuff like this is more important than tuning your learning parameters, because your data better represents reality and is thus more predictive, in my experience.\n\n#### Comment ID id3vjp9 with +1 score by [(nucLeaRStarcraft, Reddit, 2022-06-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vgoc1h/d_in_your_experience_whats_the_thing_that_can/id3vjp9/) (in reply to ID id3anhg):\nwhy not make them categorical and use one-hot encoding?\n\n#### Comment ID id411m0 with +1 score by [(vtec__, Reddit, 2022-06-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vgoc1h/d_in_your_experience_whats_the_thing_that_can/id411m0/) (in reply to ID id3anhg):\ncould you elaborate more on converting them to x,y coordinates?\n\n#### Comment ID idkt5k1 with +1 score by [(derHumpink_, Reddit, 2022-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vgoc1h/d_in_your_experience_whats_the_thing_that_can/idkt5k1/) (in reply to ID id3anhg):\nwhat kind of feature engineering do you do when working only with image data? there's not much more intricate to be done than cropping and random transformations like flipping, rotating, and hoping the model picks up *something*\n\n### Comment ID id3ahma with +13 score by [(Ulfgardleo, Reddit, 2022-06-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vgoc1h/d_in_your_experience_whats_the_thing_that_can/id3ahma/) (in reply to ID id2ro3q):\nA friend of mine who went to industry said one very smart thing:\n\nIn research you pretend that you have to solve a given task with both hands tied behind your back.\n\nThe standard dataset in research is there to make results between algorithms comparable, which is of little interest in an actual application domain.\n\n//edit And it is also not what actually happens in research.

The setting I'm working with is Bayesian linear regression, so I'm mostly interested in shrinkage priors which have a small number hyper parameters to tune.\n\nSo far I've come across full Bayesian inference, empirical Bayes estimate and cross-validation. However, I've not been able to find good explanations of how full Bayesian inference and the empirical Bayes estimate methods work. I'm familiar with cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning in the machine learning setting, but I'm not sure how it is used for hyperparameter tuning for priors in Bayesian statistics.\n\n## Comment ID iurh2j0 with +17 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-11-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/yk67mo/q_choosing_hyperparameters_for_priors_in_bayesian/iurh2j0/) (in reply to ID yk67mo):\nI think it's important to get out of the mindset of \"tuning\" when you're doing Bayesian data analysis.   Because either you have a lot of data (in which case they will be almost irrelevant compared to your model form and distribution choices) or you will have few data points and they will be influential but need to be theoretically justified.    \n\nTuning basically implies optimizing to data which is not what you're trying to do.  Granted, priors don't always represent true beliefs in practice, but they are usually set for reasons of convergence or flexibility.  For example, I think student t with 3 degrees of freedom is common for regression coefficients.  \n\nIf you're just looking at shrinkage in for regression, I'd look into horseshoe/hierarchical shrinkage priors (\"hs()\" family in brms)\n\n### Comment ID iurkbwg with +1 score by [(Peacemark, Reddit, 2022-11-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/yk67mo/q_choosing_hyperparameters_for_priors_in_bayesian/iurkbwg/) (in reply to ID iurh2j0):\nHow would you choose the hyperparameters for the horseshoe for instance?\n\n#### Comment ID iurot0v with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-11-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/yk67mo/q_choosing_hyperparameters_for_priors_in_bayesian/iurot0v/) (in reply to ID iurkbwg):\n[This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01694) can help you translate your sparsity assumptions into hyperparams.

We choose priors to reflect something we think is reasonable, and we run the model. If we're worried about sensitivity to the prior, we can either add a layer to the model or do a sensitivity analysis (or both). But if we pick our priors using the data, then we've got data in the prior and data in the likelihood and that's not great (I'm not against empirical Bayes methods, mind you, but the name of the game is caution).\n\nSo, for Horseshoes, if we have a prior that says the coefficients are Horseshoe(gamma), we wonder \"how do we set gamma?\" We can try to choose a reasonable value, let's call it gamma_0. We could use the methodology of Piironen and Vehtari, or we could try to use some prior probability that a coefficient is effectively 0. We can also put a prior on gamma. In which case, we want something with a decent mass near 0 and which keeps values from getting too excessive compared to gamma_0. Half-Cauchy priors are popular here, and you could use gamma_0 as your prior median. Now we've bought ourselves some extra flexibility. If our prior guess, gamma_0, isn't exactly right, the fact that we've got a distribution on gamma means that won't tank the whole analysis (probably, there are some cases where things are sensitive even to the parameters of the hyperprior, but then you just have to pick something reasonable and go with it).\n\nAs to the link someone shared to the R blog, I don't think that's so relevant. That's about optimization. Sure, you can do Bayesian optimization, that's MAP inference. But that's basically just regularized maximum likelihood, so you can do things you'd do elsewhere, and you won't be using Horseshoes. Horseshoes are designed to regularize posterior *distributions*, even means/medians. If you just want to regularize a point estimate for maximization, there's nothing wrong with L1/LASSO.\n\n### Comment ID ius2zra with +1 score by [(Peacemark, Reddit, 2022-11-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/yk67mo/q_choosing_hyperparameters_for_priors_in_bayesian/ius2zra/) (in reply to ID iurwij5):\nIn which cases would you use the Horseshoe as opposed to something like a Gaussian prior or student t for the regression coefficients? I'm assuming for p>n you would want to use some shrinkage prior, where as for p \\~= n or p < n something like a flat prior or other non-informative prior would be more common?\n\n#### Comment ID iusc9qo with +1 score by [(n_eff, Reddit, 2022-11-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/yk67mo/q_choosing_hyperparameters_for_priors_in_bayesian/iusc9qo/) (in reply to ID ius2zra):\nYou've got to think in Bayesian terms. We always have priors, so our posteriors are always identified even if we would have a nonidentifiability issue fitting the model with likelihood alone. In a perfectly valid sense, we don't have to give a shit about p > n (I mean, maybe we should, but the point stands). The question is, what do we want our priors to say? Or perhaps, what do we want to do with our model?\n\nYou use a Horseshoe (or related prior) when you want to either impose sparsity or when you want to do some sort of Bayesian model averaging or model selection. (Some people will quibble with whether you can really do BMA with shrinkage priors, but I have seen enough bimodal posteriors to believe it is possible.) So, you can do this with lots of parameters (say, p > n) or even with fewer if you're just interested in model averaging/selection.\n\nYou use some other prior when you don't want to impose sparsity, or when you're not trying to do one big model averaging/selection analysis. Some people like Normals. Some people prefer something heavier-tailed (like a t with df >= 3 or maybe a Laplace). People often like \"weakly informative\" priors here. Priors that are 0-centered and which have variances that keep most of the prior mass on sane values. What is sane? That's where domain expertise comes in, or perhaps a survey of meta-analyses in the field. I seem to recall seeing a paper that claimed most biomedical effect sizes were within [-2,2] but I can't seem to track the source down. You can also try to address it from first principles: if the covariate X generally is within the range X\\_l, X\\_h, would you expect to see the average at X\\_h be higher than X\\_l by 1? 10? 100? You can use the point at which you go from \"eh, maybe?\" to \"no way\" to produce a prior that keeps things in plausible regions.\n\nAs to uninformative and flat priors, my advice is: don't. A lot of blood and ink has been spilled in the quest for \"uninformative\" or \"objective\" priors, but I don't know how far it's gotten us. You've got Jeffreys priors, which are derived to be invariant under changes of parameterization. Is that convenient? In some cases. Is that objective? In a pig's eye. Then you've got reference priors, which are designed to maximize the difference between prior and posterior. Is that \"uninformative\"? Or is that just \"putting a prior that puts a lot of mass in dumb regions of the parameter space\"? (There are some lecture notes [here](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/courses/260-spring10/lectures/lecture7.pdf), lectures 6-8, that talk more about these.) And uniform priors are worse still. A colleague of mine once referred to flat priors as \"uniformative\" because uniform priors carry rather a *lot* of information. Consider an effectively semi-infinite uniform, a Uniform(0,DBL_MAX), which is [something like](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1848700/biggest-integer-that-can-be-stored-in-a-double) Uniform(0,1.8e308). The mean is 9.0e307, which is also effectively infinite. I don't know about you, but I haven't met a regression coefficient that exists [beyond the number of stars in the universe](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Herschel/How_many_stars_are_there_in_the_Universe).",

I have a clusters of data (patient data) that I would like to cluster based on similarities.  The problem is there are a lot of unknowns that makes training a huge task and many unknown factors.  We are looking for methods to pull in a record and \"group\" it based on several factors.  Some we can train, gender, age, zip code, years in service, etc.  But others would be impossible to train since there are so many factors.  For example, we have a person come in with the following:  \n\n\nage: 43\n\nYears in service: 20\n\nZip code: 83333\n\nGender: Female\n\nBut there is also other data that would be important like the number of critical incidents, number of charges, disciplinary actions, previous medical history, medication, previous work locations, etc.  As you can image there is a lot of data.  We are looking for a pattern.  So if this person comes in and we analyze the record, we want the ML system to pick up the obvious \"trained\" factors we know to look for, but we would also like the ML to pick up trends.

This was enough to get the hyperparameters close-ish to their eventual values.\n\nThe next step was to scale up the working model, and this was what took the longest time. I monitored gradients because I was constantly getting gradient collapse even when I shouldn’t have in theory. Admittedly, figuring this out was a lot of trial and error, with training times between 1 and 4 hours at this stage.\n\nEventually, the culprit turned out to be the AMSGrad optimizer I was using, and I switched to a mix of NADAM and ADAMW instead. I then tested a bunch of configurations at the size that took 4 hours to train, manually graded them, and looked for any indirect metrics that might be useful for automated hyperparameter tuning. At this point, everything was working well enough at several different sizes that I was confident whatever metric I ended up with would also be useful at the final model size.\n\nIt turned out that a weighted ratio of the critic loss and its standard deviation fit the bill, so the final step was to run automated hyperparameter tuning using Bayes optimization for a few hyperparameters at the final model size. This took about a week, even though I trained with fewer epochs, so each run was about 12 hours. I kept all the other hyperparameters the same as in the smaller version.\n\nThankfully, all of this is pretty much a worst case scenario. Normally, you can use Bayesian optimization for much more of the process, and therefore automate it to a much greater extent.\n\n## Comment ID kfwf6wk with +8 score by [(ForceBru, Reddit, 2024-01-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/18w9jh8/is_hyperparameter_tuning_a_scam/kfwf6wk/) (in reply to ID 18w9jh8):\n> Is it something that is nice to do if you have the resources for it, but realistically it's rarely feasible?\n\nI think this is mostly correct, but not sure about \"rarely\". You might somewhat often find that very simple models work well enough. So you go ahead and quickly tune their hyperparameters. Not sure this happens \"rarely\" - it could be more common. For example, the Box-Jenkins approach for fitting ARIMA time-series models is literally based on hyperparameter tuning for finding the orders of the model. ARIMA models are so fast to fit that this procedure is built into various libraries, so you don't even have to think about it.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't even try to tune hyperparameters of some massive transformer, simply because I'm not a multibillion-dollar company and don't have enough compute and time.\n\n## Comment ID kfwkn21 with +6 score by [(Yogi_DMT, Reddit, 2024-01-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/18w9jh8/is_hyperparameter_tuning_a_scam/kfwkn21/) (in reply to ID 18w9jh8):\nI'm not sure what you mean by HPO being a scam.

It’s not solely about hyperparameter tuning, but the [revisiting resnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07579) paper really highlights how much impact things that aren’t the model architecture have on model architecture performance. (+3% Top-1)\n\nGenerally there is some overlap in hyperparameter performance on simpler tasks or shorter training to more complex tasks and longer training, so people get more tuning in by only doing very long training once the methods are mature. At least historically, people have heavily relied on early stopping in order to stop hyperparameter experiments with unpromising results before they consumed too many resources.\n\nFinally, this is one of the reasons that industrial labs have been so successful in DL. When you have a large budget for compute, you can spend it on more thoroughly investigating hyperparameter settings for your experiments and final models so you get higher quality results and more quickly find stable settings for hard-to-stabilize techniques like those commonly used in deep RL. All major groups developing DL algorithms —research, production, industrial, and academic — have standard recipes that they understand and have incrementally tuned, so they often get a solid head start when compared with people implementing things from scratch or tuning from basic reference implementations.\n\n### Comment ID kfz3gfz with +1 score by [(Educational_Roll_868, Reddit, 2024-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/18w9jh8/is_hyperparameter_tuning_a_scam/kfz3gfz/) (in reply to ID kfyj4tl):\nOh this is interesting to know.

How do you hyperparameter tune this thing?   \n\n\n2) You mention that you can assume that the same hyperparams for simple tasks will work on longer tasks. So to give a simple example let's say we have a huge CNN that we want to train on ImageNet. If we take a smaller version of this CNN and find optimal hyperparameters on CIFAR, you say it would be a good assumption to take those hyperparams and use them on the larger CNN for the ImageNEt data?\n\n#### Comment ID kg0bwz3 with +3 score by [(OddInstitute, Reddit, 2024-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/18w9jh8/is_hyperparameter_tuning_a_scam/kg0bwz3/) (in reply to ID kfz3gfz):\n1. There are a few different ways to tune a project like AlexNet depending on what resources you have available. Alex Krizhevsky did a couple of things explicitly focused on increasing training speed and thus increasing his hyperparameter iteration speed as well as overall quality. [He was one of the first  people to run ConvNets on parallel GPUs](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/), so he had access to much more compute resources than almost anyone else working on the problem at the time (section 3.2 in the paper). He also used ReLu activations in order to speed up the training time (section 3.1 in the paper).\n\nI don’t know exactly how he did it, but I can guess. He worked on the CIFAR datasets, so he may have roughed in his hyperparameters on those. His final results are from 90 epochs of training on imagenet, so it’s possible that he did the bulk of his tuning at 15 epochs. \n\n6 days is also not all that long, that’s 30 iteration cycles in a six month period assuming no early stopping. Not ideal, but definitely enough to make major improvements.\n\nIf he had more than two GPUs, he could have been running multiple training runs at once. This doesn’t improve the total number of iterations, but does increase the number of independent datapoints he can assess at each step, which would help quite a bit with a grid search.\n\nFor some modern context, [ImageNet is a pretty small dataset, so with enough compute, you can get Alex’s 30 cycles in less than a day.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05011#:~:text=State%2Dof%2Dthe%2Dart,Facebook's%20on%20corresponding%20batch%20sizes)\n\nAs long as you have the regularization for it, training for longer tends to just improve quality, so he might have found something good that runs in a day and then expanded the training time until he hit diminishing returns.\n\nWhile Alex is famously good at hyperparameter tuning, something else that is important to keep in mind is that the AlexNet results aren’t very good by modern standards. Even with an ensemble of models, the AlexNet paper reports 63.3% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. The current SOTA on Papers with Code for ImageNet-only training is 88.3% Top-1. This is ~2.7x as big of an improvement as AlexNet made over the previous (2011) ILSVRC winner.\n\nThere are other confounding factors and this definitely doesn’t take away from the paper at all, but it does reflect your intuition that AlexNet couldn’t have been tuned all that much given the reported training times (and knowledge at the time). It did, however, open up the floodgates for further work in the area as well as give everyone that follows a known good starting point.\n\n2. I wouldn’t expect them to work perfectly, but it’s definitely a better starting point than just guessing. In practice, ImageNet is the dataset that most people use as a starting point for their production tasks.\n\n## Comment ID kfzy0fj with +2 score by [(Snake2k, Reddit, 2024-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/18w9jh8/is_hyperparameter_tuning_a_scam/kfzy0fj/) (in reply to ID 18w9jh8):\nTo give a real life example:\n\nI work on a time series forecasting model that is a NN under the hood.

The model being learned is approximating a function that maps n-volumes of a high dimensional space to particular classes. For tabular data those n-volumes are likely to be very regular in nature, bounded  on the edges by hyperplanes or manifolds that are approximately hyperplanes. Moving along any particular axis cleanly takes you from one classification to another classification, and small shifts of a few values will not change the classification almost everywhere in the space. This is why it makes sense to put the data in a table in the first place. Since SVM, tree boosting, etc classify a space by slicing it with hyperplanes, they are very suited to the problem of classifying a space where the classifications are delineated by hyperplanes or other manifolds of low curvature.\n\nOn the contrary, many classification problems require approximating a function to classify n-volumes whose boundaries have high curvature/concavity/eccentricity/etc. For those sorts of problems segmenting the space with hyperplanes will always perform poorly, which is where the value of the nonlinearity of DL solutions come into play.\n\n### Comment ID e4d74wl with +76 score by [(zawerf, Reddit, 2018-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9826bt/d_why_is_deep_learning_so_bad_for_tabular_data/e4d74wl/) (in reply to ID e4cvqbb):\n[This lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=754vWvIimPo&feature=youtu.be&t=2040) calls it the manifold hypothesis.\n\nThe tl;dw; is that the layers will sequentially straighten the data manifold until it's more or less linearly separable in the penultimate layer, and can be classified by a final logistic regression(which can only do linear decision boundaries).

DL models are generally much more highly parameterized. All else equal, since distances in higher dimensional space are larger than distances in lower dimensional space we should expect DL models to take much longer to converge to the same solution. All of that dimensionality also gives them a much higher capacity to overfit. While a DL model has to explore the entire vast space of all possible manifolds, a SVM or tree boosting model has a much smaller space to explore. With so much space to explore and such slow convergence to do it with DL models often fail to find robust solutions at all, or wind up snarled with low velocity in the vicinity of an overfit.\n\n### Comment ID i0xioyv with +1 score by [(lifeonahilltop, Reddit, 2022-03-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9826bt/d_why_is_deep_learning_so_bad_for_tabular_data/i0xioyv/) (in reply to ID e4cvqbb):\nIsn't it interesting that, based on what you said, DL can approximate complex boundaries but struggle with simpler ones?

I think it was originally based on survey data, crawling the code base, or a combination of both.

But they're the same as what people typically consider as tabular data.\n\nThe reason these are not talked more outside is, one, the models are pretty simple (embeddings + fully-connected layers + logistic regression/softmax/regressor), so there is not much to write papers about; two, a lot of it is business critical, so best kept under wraps (ads prediction, search ranking).\n\nIf you look carefully, there are a few hints about this in the published information:\n\n* The [TFX platform](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2017/papers/view/tfx-a-tensorflow-based-production-scale-machine-learning-platform) is mostly about dealing with tabular data (at least initially).\n* The [Estimator API](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02637) also started its life supporting tabular data (`DNNClassifier`).\n* TPUs have specialized hardware to [accelerate](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/tpu/ops/tpu_embedding_ops.cc) embedding lookup, which is mostly used for categorical features in tabular data.\n\n## Comment ID e4ditio with +10 score by [(elyase, Reddit, 2018-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9826bt/d_why_is_deep_learning_so_bad_for_tabular_data/e4ditio/) (in reply to ID 9826bt):\nThe [\"Self-Normalizing Neural Networks\" paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02515) might be of interest to you.

This is a simplification of course, but you get the point.\n\nThis has been the experience of my department, this obviously all depends on the tabular data you are working with.\n\n#### Comment ID e4oseox with +1 score by [(slwv, Reddit, 2018-08-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9826bt/d_why_is_deep_learning_so_bad_for_tabular_data/e4oseox/) (in reply to ID e4d67nc):\nLinearity in this case refers to the idea that the label is a linear combination of the features, rather than to the fact that any manifold admits a patchwork of locally Euclidean coordinate systems.\n\n### Comment ID e4dxiad with +2 score by [(nashtownchang, Reddit, 2018-08-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9826bt/d_why_is_deep_learning_so_bad_for_tabular_data/e4dxiad/) (in reply to ID e4d3cf5):\nThis is the right answer imo. It wasn't that deep learning tend to perform worse on tabular data, but it tend to perform worse on smaller data that also evolves with business and society. The current applications of deep learning are often NLP/image/or games where data can be collected in large amount and the meaning of data doesn't change much. \n\nTable is only a storage format that is used...well pretty much any industry - insurance, retail, government, healthcare data, you name it.

You're going to assume a polynomial distribution of some kind, and you can use a few different models to try and fit things and see how it works. Let's assume there are N points we're fitting, and we're using an M term polynomial. \n\nNow, if you're going to use the 'standard' approach, we all know that if M = N, you're going to have an SSE of zero, but your out of sample error is going to be huge. It's going to derive a polynomial that goes through every point, with wild fluctuations in between. if, say, N = 10, and M = 3, you're going to find a much better fit... classic bias vs variance trade off. You're basically just fucking around finding the right M to use... potentially treating it like a hyper-parameter, and using some kind of train/test split to have something to validate against. But that's pretty wasteful of your data... so it's obviously an unsatisfying solution.\n\nIn fact, it makes no sense at all since the set of Polynomials of order 3 is a subset of the set of higher order polynomials. Why does it choose the 'wrong' model? Why does it overfit in the first place? \n\nThe best explanation of the problem I've seen, is in Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, check it out. Even just the first chapter may serve to give you insight. The basic explanation laid out though... the problem of overfitting is an artifact of an MLE parameter estimation approach. You can mitigate it with some prior assumptions about the distribution of the parameters (for example, if you assume the parameters are samples from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0, it can be shown that a MLE treatment with that prior assumption will lead to ridge regression regularization... other assumptions will lead to other regularization solutions) but that's still somehow... unsatisfying. Shouldn't there be an 'intrinsic' way to train a high dimensional model on 'simple' data, and intrinsically arrive at an 'ideal' model, maybe even with some sense of 'uncertainty' for where we're more confident about the proper boundary for our decision manifold? After all, back to our polynomial model example with N data points, if we have a cluster of points in one part of the domain, and much sparser data in another, we would naturally expect an ideal approach would have more 'confidence' in the region with more data available to use to make inferences from. \n\nSo: I'm still learning and have math to get under my belt to really internalize the 'real' answer to this question (I haven't even gotten into analysis yet, and I don't even know what branch of math will lead to my 'aha' moments, much less which specific insights), but my understanding is that a full Bayesian treatment will allow you to use arbitrarily many parameters without ending up with any overfitting issues. MLE on the other hand intrinsically leads to biased results... hell, even estimating the 'real' variance from N samples from a Gaussian process... even just with two simple parameters, an MLE approach will give you the 'wrong' answer by N/(N-1) (systemic overestimation... same with exploding coefficients in an overparametrized polynomial model in our above example) EDIT: scratch that, on reflection, it systemically underestimates... the factor you need to multiply by the get an unbiased estimator is N/(N-1), I jotted this off without thinking about it. But the point stands, and in both this case and our polynomial case above, it will at least be asymptotically correct... turns out that intuition we get from our MLE variance estimation carries over to our polynomial example above too. Our M = 10 above with N = 10 will be wildly inaccurate (do it, you'll see giant values for your predicted coefficients), but if N = 100, you'll get a much more appropriate model fit, even without regularization. If even a simple MLE estimation on a simple model is going to be biased, what do you expect when you're estimating 100,000, when 100 parameters is more appropriate given the relatively low sample, low dimensional data you'll often encounter in tabular datasets?\n\nTaking a step back... how do you train a neural net? In practice, all you're doing is using a numerical approximation method to get an estimate for the same thing you can solve analytically in any statistics course. You've got a 'likelihood' function you've defined in some way based on the data you have and the model you're assuming, define a risk function based on some loss function (SSE for example) you take the log, take the gradient with respect to the model parameters, set equal to zero, et voilà! Your standard NN training approach is just a high dimensional MLE parameter estimation scheme, with all the troubles that entails. The complexities of backpropogation and SGD or whatever might obfuscate what's really going on, but what you're doing is absolutely no different than the standard decision process you'd be using in a statistics course for a standard gaussian parameter estimation or something. (at least with a standard feed forward NN... I don't know the math yet for CNNs or RNNs, so I can't comment). \n\nI'm sure there vastly more satisfying explanations that reach into the true heart of this... but I'm also sure it'll be another 3 years of study before I have the theory under my belt to really, truly understand WHY MLE is prone to overestimation, and why the bayesian treatment (in a deep, intuitive sense) 'fixes' the problem... I already get why the other approaches work (more data equals a wider gap in M < N, and regularization just inserts a kind of prior about the distribution of the parameters you're estimating) but the Bayesian approach makes some slightly different assumptions... it's subtle, but has some wide reaching impact. There's probably better ways to learn it (there's a whole book on Decision theory on my list) but I learned the basics from Hogg and Craig... chapter 6 in volume 4, sections .2 and .6 I think. Might be worth checking out if you can find a pdf of one of the versions, if you'd like a rigorous statistical introduction with simple low dimensional examples. There's probably better intros though... but yeah, the underlying tradeoffs in a frequentist vs Bayesian approach to Decision theory I think is at the heart of this question.\n\nAnyway... it's cool, exciting stuff. Good questions to be asking I think. Check out Bishop's, chapter 5 in particular has a whole Bayesian treatment of NNs. I haven't really gotten that far yet, but it looks interesting, and from a cursory perusal at least, maybe it'll have what you're looking for: a relatively 'set it and forget it' approach to NNs without an intrinsic bias/variance tradeoff. As for WHY the Bayesian approach fixes the problem though... if only I had more time in the day. Fuck there's a lot to learn. \n\nAlso: it should be said, Bayesian approaches do require an explicit prior. I have no idea how that works in the context of NNs... no such thing as a free lunch I guess. I'm excited to get up to chapter 5 in Bishop's and see how that works. A full Bayesian treatment even just of our above polynomial example can be a fair bit more computationally intensive too... I have no idea what a Bayesian NN would look like, but it might end up being unreasonably expensive to calculate, no idea. Stuff to learn more about this year.\n\n## Comment ID e4cniqn with +15 score by [(olBaa, Reddit, 2018-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9826bt/d_why_is_deep_learning_so_bad_for_tabular_data/e4cniqn/) (in reply to ID 9826bt):\nTypically you are able to achieve something close to xgboost perforance with some tuning.\n\n### Comment ID e4cwgf4 with +15 score by [(maltin, Reddit, 2018-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9826bt/d_why_is_deep_learning_so_bad_for_tabular_data/e4cwgf4/) (in reply to ID e4cniqn):\nIf you find out that a startup is selling \"Deep Learning Methods for Tabular Data\", you would probably roll your eyes.\n\nThis is because nobody uses DL for tabular data.

Often they are more complex. In an image, all the information to identify what's in it is usually within that image. With tabular data it is very probable that you will lack important variables for your objective. Also, the models used for unstructured data like image recognition are tailored for that particular objective. Essentially introducing a form of bias to the problem, simplifying it. You can try to use a fc deep net for image recognition, but a stack of pca & svm or xgboost might be better, and a CNN even better, depending on the amount of data you have and a few other factors.

One can think of this as a feature engineering problem: given good hand-tuned feature engineering xgboost, RF or SVM can do very well on MNIST (for example). The work is in tuning that feature engineering stage. In contrast the deep network is *learning* the feature engineering (particularly via the convolution layers), so out of the box it works better. When you switch to tabular data the features are often already well engineered (relatively speaking, compared to raw pixel data in images); at that point the classical approaches do an excellent job and the advantages of DL for feature engineering disappear.\n\n## Comment ID e4csdth with +14 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9826bt/d_why_is_deep_learning_so_bad_for_tabular_data/e4csdth/) (in reply to ID 9826bt):\nThis [small fastai blog](http://www.fast.ai/2018/04/29/categorical-embeddings/) does not answer your question directly but answers the question \"How can I get the best possible performance from DL methods?\" \n\nInterestingly, their approach is much more focused on using **categorical embedding** - instead of modeling using conv or wide linear networks.

I have a hunch that structured data has a different level of abstraction represented by the absence of higher level correlation between the variables. \n\nIn experimental design, we usually call this \"a many variable interaction\". If our variables are sex, age and wealth, it is very, very hard to find an effect that would *not* happen to rich women, young women or rich people but *would* happen to rich young women. While the effects of wealth, age or sex can be complicated (hence wide), they hardly form a three-variable effect that is meaningful, hence the problem needs no depth and main effects and 2-by-2 correlations concentrate most of the difficulty of the problem. Boosted stumps excel at fitting these effects. \n\nDL, on the other hand, excels at finding complicated higher order correlations. In images, for example, it is quite likely to find patterns and effects that only emerge when a certain number of pixels is present, effects that are not covered by pairwise interaction of pixels. Trees need way too much depth to even see one of these effects, and have no translational invariance to help them learn abstractions.\n\nThis is all a bunch of guesswork and I would love to find more theory on why tabular data is so tricky to fit with NN. I am aware that NN are an universal approximator and can in theory be tortured in tuning to yield good results, but reality is that these models need way too much babysitting and time to perform somewhere close to out-of-the-box boosted trees.

Here are a few key insights:\n\n> We show that this very simple formulation is very competitive\nfor standard image processing problems such as denoising,\ninpainting and super-resolution. This is particularly\nremarkable because no aspect of the network is learned\nfrom data; instead, the weights of the network are always\nrandomly initialized, so that the only prior information is in\nthe structure of the network itself.\n\n> [...]\n\n> One may wonder why a high-capacity network fθ can be used as a\nprior at all. In fact, one may expect to be able to find parameters\nθ recovering any possible image x, including random\nnoise, so that the network should not impose any restriction\non the generated image. We now show that, while indeed\nalmost any image can be fitted, the choice of network architecture\nhas a major effect on how the solution space is\nsearched by methods such as gradient descent. In particular,\nwe show that the network resists “bad” solutions and\ndescends much more quickly towards naturally-looking images.\nThe result is that minimizing (2) either results in a\ngood-looking local optimum, or, at least, the optimization\ntrajectory passes near one.\n\n> [...]\n\n> Thus, although in the limit the parametrization can fit unstructured\nnoise, it does so very reluctantly. In other words,\nthe parametrization offers high impedance to noise and low\nimpedance to signal. Therefore for most applications, we\nrestrict the number of iterations in the optimization process\n(2) to a certain number of iterations. The resulting prior\nthen corresponds to projection onto a reduced set of images\nthat can be produced from z by ConvNets with parameters\nθ that are not too far from the random initialization θ0.\n\nFor those of you who are just learning about this paper now: it's going to be ok. You can pick your jaw up off the floor unembarrassed, we all went through the same thing when we read this paper. It's pretty wild. \n\nMy interpretation of this is that certain neural network architectures work incredibly well for certain classes of problems because the structure of the network is particularly amenable to modeling the generating distribution. Tasks where other models beat neural networks, those techniques model the generating distribution more directly.\n\nDeep CNN's work well for modeling images because the most condensed/sparse coding for an image is in terms of abstract concepts which are built up from lower level abstractions. \"A picture's worth a thousand words\". A difficult non-linear regression task probably doesn't need this kind of sequential abstract feature engineering: rather we mainly need to select the most predictive variables, model appropriate interactions, and control for overfitting. This is where tree ensembles excel, and they accomplish it with a much sparser set of parameters than most modern ANN architectures would for the same data. \n\nObviously this isn't a hard and fast rule (you absolutely can do some fantastic regression on tabular data with DNNs), but I think it's the appropriate way to think about the phenomenon you're asking about.\n\n### Comment ID e4ditgr with +2 score by [(shortscience_dot_org, Reddit, 2018-08-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9826bt/d_why_is_deep_learning_so_bad_for_tabular_data/e4ditgr/) (in reply to ID e4disa8):\nI am a bot!

(And often to great effect!) It's true that many companies stick with simpler techniques like logistic regression, but that's more of a gains VS compute/latency VS explainability trade-off. Another caveat is that DL doesn't work well over small datasets (small = some few thousand for non-trivial stuff, but obviously problem-dependent).\n\nI think your question as-is is too vague, though. Really depends on the kind of data, and what kind of preprocessing you're doing.\n\nYou'll generally want your text embedded, your categoricals one-hot encoded (or embedded as well) and your numbers normalized. (Obviously a rule of thumb, there's no one-size-fits-all.) Same goes for engineered features, rather than raw data. \n\ne.g. rather than just feeding in big numbers (like salary data), you'll want to normalize the inputs and get your values in the range [0,1]. Intuitively: weight decay punishes the weights on your hidden nodes equally, and if some inputs need to be scaled up/down in order to have the same contribution in subsequent layers, you're pretty much fighting against regularization to be able to use your inputs.\n\nFinally, to quote something I once heard: \"DL has caused a shift from feature engineering to architecture engineering\".

Standard scaling is applied to input features to bring them to a similar scale, but for the target variable, it might not be necessary. You typically scale only the input features.\n\n- Make sure that the preprocessing steps applied to the unseen data are consistent with those applied to the training and test sets.

What insight can I extract from this? with +28 score by [(sahebqaran, Reddit, 2022-05-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/umvcne/random_forest_significantly_outperforms_neural/)\nHi,\n\nI'm working on a regression problem for a personal project, and I've noticed that random forest performs significantly better than the current neural net architectures I'm using. (about 0.7 R2 for a fairly deep RF on test-data vs 0.2-3 R2 for 2 hidden layer NN on even the training data). Does this mean that my problem needs a deeper, more complex model? more importantly, since according to my understanding RF uses a random combination of features at every decision node, does this mean I should be trying to extract features by combining some of my features, maybe something similar to self-attention? Or am I deeply misunderstanding my problem? I've considered that perhaps I need a very different loss function, but I think there is some insight i can extract from this large disparity.\n\nFor context, I have 15 independent variables as features, in addition to about 500 linear or non-linear combinations of them that I know may have some significance based on papers I have read and domain knowledge.\n\n## Comment ID i84k1a6 with +50 score by [(TheUSARMY45, Reddit, 2022-05-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/umvcne/random_forest_significantly_outperforms_neural/i84k1a6/) (in reply to ID umvcne):\nThe insight you can gather is that Neural Networks aren’t necessarily the best choice for every task - certainly it’s true that neural nets (and especially deep neural nets) really shine with large amounts of data, but even still depending on the nature of your task, you will see that simpler models may be better suited.

      "# [The VAE Used for Stable Diffusion Is Flawed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39215242)\nI’ve done a lot of experiments with latent diffusion and also discovered a few flaws in the SD VAE’s training and architecture, which have hardly no attention brought to them. This is concerning as the VAE is a crucial competent when it comes to image quality and is responsible for many of the artefacts associated with AI generated imagery, and no amount of training the diffusion model will fix them.\n\nA few I’ve seen are:\n\n- The goal should be to have latent outputs as closely resemble gaussian distributed terms between -1 and 1 with a variance of 1, but the outputs are unbounded (you could easily clamp or apply tanh to force them to be between -1 and 1), and the KL loss weight is too low, hence why the latents are weighed by a magic number to more closely fit the -1 to 1 range before being invested by the diffusion model.\n\n- To decrease the computational load of the diffusion model, you should reduce the spatial dimensions of the input - having a low number of channels is irrelevant. The SD VAE turns each 8x8x3 block into a 1x1x4 block when it could be turning it into a 1x1x8 (or even higher) block and preserve much more detail at basically 0 computational cost, since the first operation the diffusion model does is apply a convolution to greatly increase the number of channels.\n\n- The discriminator is based on a tiny PatchGAN, which is an ancient model by modern standards. You can have much better results by applying some of the GAN research of the last few years, or of course using a diffusion decoder which is then distilled either with consistency or adversarial distillation.\n\n- KL divergence in general is not even the most optimal way to achieve the goals of a latent diffusion model’s VAE, which is to decrease the spatial dimensions of the input images and have a latent space that’s robust to noise and local perturbations. I’ve had better results with a vanilla AE, clamping the outputs, having a variance loss term and applying various perturbations to the latents before they are ingested by the decoder.\n\nFrom the SD-XL paper:\n\n> To this end, we train the same autoencoder architecture used for the original Stable Diffusion at a larger batch-size (256 vs 9) and additionally track the weights with an exponential moving average. The resulting autoencoder outperforms the original model in all evaluated reconstruction metrics\n\nAnd if you look at the SD-XL VAE config file, it has a scaling factor of 0.13025 while the original SD VAE had one of 0.18215 - so meaning it was also trained with an unbounded output. The architecture is also the exact same if you inspect the model file.\n\nBut if you have any details about the training procedure of the new VAE that they didn’t include in the paper, feel free to link to them, I’d love to take a look.\n\nEverything you've said is _intuitively_ correct, but empirically wrong. I've experimented with training VAEs for audio diffusion for the last few months and here's what I found:\n\n- Although the best results for a stand-alone VAE might require increasing the KL loss weight as high as you can to reach an isotropic gaussian latent space without compromising reconstruction quality, beyond a certain point this actually substantially decreases the ability of the diffusion model to properly interpret the latent space and degrades generation quality. The motivation behind constraining the KL loss weight is to ensure the VAE only provides _perceptual_ compression, which VAEs are quite good at, not _semantic_ compression, for which VAEs are a poor generative model compared to diffusion. This is explained in the original latent diffusion paper on which Stable Diffusion was based: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10752.pdf\n\n- You're correct that trading dimensions for channels is a very easy way to increase reconstruction quality of a stand-alone VAE, but it is a very poor choice when the latents are going into a diffusion model. This again makes the latent space harder for the diffusion model to interpret, and again isn't needed if the VAE is strictly operating in the perceptual compression regime as opposed to the semantic compression regime. The underlying reason is channel-wise degrees of freedom have no inherent structure imposed by the underlying convolutional network; in the limit where you hypothetically compress dimensions to a single point with a large number of channels the latent space is completely unstructured and the entropy of the latents is fully maximized; there are no patterns left whatsoever for the diffusion model to work with.\n\nTLDR: Designing VAEs for latent diffusion has a different set of design constraints than designing a VAE as a stand-alone generative model.\n\nThese are very fine ways of explaining simple things in an ego-boosting manner. The more you work with ML these days the more you appreciate it. It happens with every new technology bubble.\n\nIn regular terms he's saying the outputs aren't coming out in the same dimensions that the next stages cn work with properly. It wants values between -1 and +1 and it isn't guaranteeing it. Then he's saying you can make it quicker to process by putting the data into a more compact structure for the next stage.\n\nThe discriminator could be improved. i.e we could capture better input\n\nKL Diversion is not an accurate tool for manipulating the data, and we have better.\n\nML is a huge pot of turning regular computer science and maths into intelligible papers. If you'd like assurance, look up something like MinMax functions and Sigmoids. You've likely worked with these since you progressed from HelloWorld.cpp but wouldn't care to shout about them in public\n\nIt's a common problem for network protocols, IO subsystems, etc. and really even any software with error handling.\n\nIt's been a few years since I worked on any program using boost asio, but at least back then if you straced it you'd find it constantly attempting to malloc hundreds of TB of ram, failing harmlessly, then continuing on with its life. (bet that will be fun when someone tries to run it on a system that supports that much virtual address space)\n\nSimilarly anything with any kind of feedback correction. PID controllers, codecs that code residuals-- you can get things horribly wrong and the later steps will paper it over.\n\nTaking a step back you can even say that common software development practices-- a kind of meta program-- have the issue: A drunk squirrel sends you a patch full of errors, your test suite flags some which you fix. Then you ship all the bugs you didn't catch, because the test suite caused you to fix some issues but didn't change the fact that you were accepting code from a dubious source.\n\nSo I would say that the ML world is only special in that they exist almost entirely of self-correcting mechanisms and that inconsistent performance is broadly expected to a vastly greater degree, so when errors leak through you still may not react. If a calculator app told you that 2+2=5 you'd immediately be sure that something is actually broken, while if some LLM does it, it could just be an expected limitation (or even just sampling bad luck).\n\n> It's a spot where the VAE is trying to smuggle global information about the image through latent space. This is exactly the problem that KL-divergence loss is supposed to prevent.\n\nIs that what KL divergence does?\n\nI thought it was supposed to (when combined with reconstruction loss) “smooth” the latent space out so that you could interpolate over it.\n\nDoesn’t increasing the weight of the KL term just result in random output in the latent; eg. What you get if you opt purely for KL divergence?\n\nI honestly have no idea at all what the OP has found or what it means, but it doesnt seem that surprising that modifying the latent results in global changes in the output.\n\nIs manually editing latents a thing?\n\nSurely you would interpolate from another latent…? And if the result is chaos, you dont have well clustered latents? (Which is what happens from too much KL, not too little right?)\n\nI'd feel a lot more 'across' this if the OP had demonstrated it on a trivial MNIST vae with both the issue, the result and quantitatively what fixing it does.\n\n> What are the implications?\n\n> Somewhat subtle, but significant.\n\nMm. I have to say I don't really get it.\n\nI can't comment on what changing the weights of the KL divergence does in this context, but generally\n\n> Is that what KL divergence does?\n\nKL divergence is basically a distance \"metric\" in the space of probability distributions. If you have two probability distributions A and B, you can ask how similar they are. \"Metric\" is in scare quotes because you can't actually get a distance function in the usual sense. For example, dist(A,B) != dist(B,A).\n\nIf you think about the distribution as giving information about things, then the distance function should say two things are close if they provide similar information and are distant if one provides more information about something than the other.\n\nThe comment claims (and I assume they know what they're talking about) that after training we want the KL divergence to be close to a standard Gaussian. So that would mean that our statistical distribution gives roughly the same information as a standard Gaussian. It sounds like this distribution has a whole lot of information in one heavily localized area though (or maybe too little information in that area, I'm not sure which way it goes).\n\nUnfortunately I don't know this field yet. User 317070 may have more context here. They commented here [0] about how to think about the KL divergence as measuring information from from the encoder to the decoder and what we want out of that.\n\nBut based on the link you sent, it looks like what we're doing is creating multiple distributions each of which we want patterned on the standard normal. The key diagrams are https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*96h... and https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*xCj.... You want the little clouds around each dot to be roughly the same shape. Intuitively, it seems like we want to add noise in various places, and we want that noise to be Gaussian noise. So to achieve that we measure the \"distance\" of each of these distributions from the standard Gaussian using KL divergence.\n\nTo me, it seems like one way to look at this is that the KL divergence is essentially a penalty term and it's the reconstruction loss we really want to optimize. The KL penalty term is there to serve essentially as a model of smoothness so that we don't veer too far away from continuity.\n\nThis might be similar to how you might try to optimize a model for, say, minimizing the cost of a car, but you want to make sure the car has 4 wheels and a steering wheel. So you might minimize the production cost while adding penalty terms for designs that have 3 or 5 wheels, etc.\n\nBut again I really want to emphasize that I don't know this field and I don't know what I'm talking about here. I'm just taking a stab.\n\n[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=317070\n\nStable diffusion (along with other text to image models like Dall-E) use a process called 'latent diffusion'.\n\nAt the core of a latent diffusion model is a de-noising process. It takes a noisy image and predicts what is noise vs what is the real image without noise. You use this to remove a bit of noise from the image and repeat to iteratively denoise an image.\n\nYou can use this to generate entirely new images by just starting with complete random noise and denoising til you get a 'proper' image. Obviously this would not give you any control over what you generated. So you incorporate 'guidance' which controls how the denoise works. For stable diffusion this guidance comes from a different neural network called CLIP (https://openai.com/research/clip) which can take some text and produce a numerical representation of it that can be correlated to an image of what the text describes (I won't go into more detail here as it's not really relevant to the VAE).\n\nThe problem you have with the denoising process is the larger the image you want to denoise the bigger the model you need, and even at a modest 512x512 (the native resolution of stable diffusion) training the model is far too expensive.\n\nThis is where the latent bit comes in. Rather than train your model on a 512x512x3 representation (3 channels R,G,B per pixel) use a compressed representation that is 64x64x4, significantly smaller than the uncompressed image and thus requiring a significantly smaller denoising model. This 64x64x4 representation is known as the 'latent' and it is said to be in a 'latent space'.\n\nHow do we produce the latent representation? A VAE, a variational autoencoder, yet another neural network. You train an encoder and decoder together to encode an image to the 64x64x4 space and decode it back to 512x512x3 with as little loss as possible.\n\nThe issue pointed out here is the VAE for stable diffusion has a flaw, it seems to put global information in a particular point of the image (to a crude approximation it might store information like 'green is the dominant colour of this image' in that point). So if you touch that point in the latent you effect the entire image.\n\nThis is bad because the denoising network is constructed in such a way that it expects that points close in the latent only effect other points close in the latent. When that's not the case it ends up 'wasting' a bunch of the network on extracting that global data from that point and fanning it out to the rest of the image (as the entire image needs to know it to denoise correctly).\n\nSo without this flaw it may be the stable diffusion denoising model could be more effective as it doesn't need to work hard to work around the flaw.\n\nEdit: Pressed enter too early, post is now complete.",

In this context, anomaly detection (AD) becomes a valuable methodology, as it supports maintenance activities in the manufacturing sector, allowing for early intervention to prevent energy waste and maintain optimal performance. Here, an AD-based method is proposed and studied to support energy-saving predictive maintenance of production lines using time series acquired directly from the field. This paper proposes a deep echo state network (DeepESN)-based method for anomaly detection by analyzing energy consumption data sets from production lines. Compared with traditional prediction methods, such as recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM), although both models show similar time series trends, the DeepESN-based method studied here appears to have some advantages, such as timelier error detection and higher prediction accuracy. In addition, the DeepESN-based method has been shown to be more accurate in predicting the occurrence of failure. The proposed solution has been extensively tested in a real-world pilot case consisting of an automated metal filter production line equipped with industrial smart meters to acquire energy data during production phases; the time series, composed of 88 variables associated with energy parameters, was then processed using the techniques introduced earlier. The results show that our method enables earlier error detection and achieves higher prediction accuracy when running on an edge device.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nIn recent years, the relationship between industrial production activities and climate change has become increasingly evident; greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been highlighted in United Nations climate change conferences [1] as particularly worrying, with the goal of improving the efficiency of industrial production and manufacturing systems by reducing global emissions by 4 % by 2030. Industrial processes are one of the pillars of the world economy, but it is important that they evolve through the use of more sustainable designs of production plants with the aim of reducing their environmental impact in terms of pollution and using resources more efficiently. In this context, in order to optimize energy costs, reduce waste, and improve environmental management, one of the crucial aspects for the industrial sector is energy management. For this reason, the analysis of production performance both in terms of efficiency and in terms of consumption has increasingly attracted attention [2,3]. Energy saving can be achieved in different ways, for example, through the application of energy-efficient technologies in production areas, operational planning improvement, and effective maintenance of all actors located in the factory. Indeed, in order to ensure the energy optimization of machinery and processes, both scheduled and predictive maintenance become essential. To ensure that a plant achieves the desired performance, it is important to design a monitoring system to gather information about the performance on maintenance operations and maintenance results. Usually, in a production plant, not only do normal wear and deterioration occur—which can often be detected by diagnostic techniques based on models, signals, or data, such as those reported in [4,5,6]—but other anomalies may also result from less easily diagnosed or measurable phenomena, especially if caused by manual operating errors, incorrect settings, or when the systems are pushed beyond their design limits. As a result, problems with production inefficiency, energy losses, increased costs, equipment downtime, plant unavailability, and excessive environmental pollution can eventually arise [7].\n\nThe effects of correct process design and operational maintenance on energy consumption have been addressed, for example, in energy-intensive sectors such as the steel industry [8] as well as in the study of the selection and diagnosis of cutting tools [9,10], optimizing the performance of machine parameters [11,12], and even preservation strategies for air pressure systems [13]. Further approaches used to account for inefficiencies are based on performance indicators, e.g., Miguel Calvo et al. [14] introduced overall environmental equipment effectiveness (OEEE), which allows one to take into account energy efficiency and sustainability when evaluating the effectiveness of the production processes, while in [15], a new performance indicator is proposed that also takes labor’s effectiveness into account. Regarding maintenance improvement, many different policies for industrial maintenance are available, but one of the most promising is predictive maintenance (PdM), which is generally defined as the use of prediction techniques and tools to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of a device or machinery, i.e., when repairs and corrections are needed in order for the production machinery to continue functioning properly [16]. Instead, Ref. [17] proposed a risk-based predictive maintenance approach for multi-state production systems, using mission reliability as the primary criterion considering three types of operational risks—fundamental, explicit, and implicit—to optimize maintenance strategies and minimize overall production costs. Several older approaches used to identify linear relationships in time series are based on statistical methods. Some of them are the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) [18], a prediction method based on past observations which differs in ensuring stationarity and residuals; seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) [19], which allows one to include seasonal components; and Seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables (SARIMAX) [20], which allows one to incorporate exogenous variables that exert influence over the series, thus enabling the modeling of external factors for more precise forecasts. Some noteworthy approaches are based on machine learning (ML) techniques to estimate the time remaining before a production line no longer functions properly [21,22]. Although this may sound attractive, it requires the availability of labeled or experimental data and complex mathematical or logical models, which makes their practical implementation difficult [23]. A further, often effective, approach is anomaly detection (AD). It not only focuses on predicting RUL, but it is based on detecting the first signs of a malfunction, or an anomaly, based on the analysis of time series collected from the machinery, which could indicate an impending failure. It can be used to discover interesting and unusual patterns and events [24]. However, most of the literature on the subject focuses mainly on the maintenance of power generation systems, such as wind farms [25,26,27], ocean wave farms [28], and so on, in order to improve their performances [29]. Although time series are widely used for AD purposes on production lines, to the authors’ knowledge, an AD method using DeepESN to support energy-saving maintenance for production lines by acquiring data directly from the field has not yet been investigated. Only a few works analyze online data streaming [30,31,32]. Furthermore, parts of the literature try to model complex system dynamic behaviors [33,34], requiring additional computational resources. The vehicle sector could also benefit from AD related to energy consumption, but their physical modeling is still very complex, e.g., Refs. [35,36], and poses serious limitations to traditional techniques, which could alternatively be addressed with new approaches based on data, as, for example, has been done for other equally complex systems such as robots [37]. Finally, there are still few ML solutions that can be trained and tested at the edge, i.e., on an embedded devices or on devices close to the data source, enabling processing at higher speeds and volumes [38] and in real time [39].\n\nIn this context, this paper proposes a method based on DeepESN for anomaly prediction in non-linear dynamical systems. Compared with traditional prediction methods such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), although both models show a similar trend in the time-series, the DeepESN-based method presents timelier error detection and achieves a higher prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the time-series prediction made by the DeepESN-based method proved to be more accurate, with the ability to predict the occurrence of a fault as clearly as the LSTM. In particular, by incorporating DeepESN into the developed AD algorithm, the temporal features of the time series data are extracted in order to predict the occurrence of an anomaly. In short, the main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:\n\nIndustrial solution proposal:\n\nA modular and commercial IIoT architecture is proposed which combines a Seneca S406 Smart Meter and an embedded device to ensure the repeatability of our solution across all available production lines in a factory scenario and the low latency requirements of future smart manufacturing systems. Specifically, the embedded device at the edge collects information from the IIoT module connected to the production line using the Modbus-TCP/IP protocol and considers all the energy parameters needed to apply the fault detection method.\n\nAnomaly detection modeling:\n\nThe anomaly prediction problem is identified, experiments are carried out on a nonlinear dynamic system, and a DeepESN-based AD method is proposed to solve the prediction problem.\n\nRunning at the Edge: Due to the limitations of the computational resources available in industrial plants, a model is proposed that can be trained and tested on devices embedded at the edge. The scheme proposes a deep network based on ESN units which captures complex temporal influences and requires low computational resources.\n\nResults and evaluations:\n\nExtensive experiments are conducted in a real scenario to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The dataset contains the time series values of the 88 variables, which are associated with energy parameters acquired using the industrial smart meter and IIoT sensors already available on the market in order to promote the replication our experiments. The results show that our method presents timelier error detection and achieves a higher prediction accuracy.\n\nThe remainder of the article is organized as follows: Section 2 shows the works related to machine learning techniques used in the context of anomaly detection with a focus on those used for forecasting outcomes and requiring a few hardware resources. Section 3 describes preliminaries in introducing the two main architectures used for our purposes: ESN and LSTM. The proposed novel DeepESP-based anomaly detection method is introduced in Section 4, while Section 5 presents materials and methods describing the whole architecture from a hardware and software point of view. The experimental analysis, visualization of results, and discussion comparing different techniques are highlighted in Section 7. Finally, the last Section 8 points out the conclusions and future developments.\n\n2. Related Work\n\nDifferent ML techniques can be applied for AD, and the most significant can be summarized as follows:\n\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN):\n\nThis is an artificial neural network (ANN) that recognizes patterns in sequences of data such as those from sensors [40]. As an example, in [41], the authors proposed OC4Seq, a multi-scale one-class RNN used to capture different levels of sequential patterns simultaneously and to embed the discrete event sequences into latent spaces, where anomalies can be detected.\n\nAutoencoder Neural Networks (AE):\n\nThese are a specific type of neural network that belongs to the class of generative models used in unsupervised learning. AEs are designed to efficiently compress input data into a lower-dimensional representation and then use that compressed information to reconstruct the original input. This process involves two main components: the encoder, which compresses the input data, and the decoder, which reconstructs the data from its compressed form. AEs are widely used for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, image denoising, and feature learning, improving the ability to capture the essential features of input data while eliminating noise and redundancy. The goal is to ensure that its latent space has good properties, which allows for the generation of new data [42].\n\nAn unsupervised AD approach is proposed in [43] where the authors introduce a sliding-window convolutional variational autoencoder (SWCVAE) which can automatically learn normal patterns from time series data in training and can detect AD in real time, both spatially and temporally, by dealing with multivariate time series data. In [44], to improve the identification of values within a dataset that vary greatly from the others, the outliers, the authors propose using stacked autoencoders to extract features and then an ensemble of probabilistic neural networks to conduct majority voting and find outliers.\n\nGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN):\n\nDeep adversarial neural networks are composed of two networks competing with each other. This setup creates a challenging adversary for the model, namely a discriminative network that learns to discern whether a sample originates from the distribution of false data or from the model. In this particular class of algorithms, the training consists of only ordinary data. Anything that is not classified in this way is labeled as an anomaly [45]. A conditional GAN was proposed in [46], and it jointly learns the generation of high-dimensional image space and the inference of latent space. This model consists of two encoders, a decoder, and a discriminator. Bidirectional GAN (BiGAN) was developed in [47], and it learns an encoder E which simultaneously maps input samples x to a latent representation z. This avoids the computationally expensive step of recovering a latent representation at test time. BiGANs was proposed in [48] to learn this inverse mapping produce a feature representation. In addition to the GAN framework, an encoder was used to map data to a latent representation.\n\nAD is usually a difficult problem to solve. Most of the techniques in the literature are designed to address a specific application case of the general problem, e.g., related to the type of data input or model, the availability of labels for the training and testing data, or the types of anomalies. Furthermore, most of them require high computational efforts or resources and are too complex to be applied on different production lines. For these reasons, the focus of our work is on the DeepESN model as an alternative RNN model.\n\n3. Preliminaries\n\nThis section presents an overview of the fundamental architectures underlying the DeepESN and LSTM models. The basic concepts of ESN are presented in Section 3.1, while those of LSTM are presented in Section 3.2. Finally, in Section 3.2.1, the efficiency of the long short-term memory model is discussed.\n\n3.1. Fundamental Concepts of the Echo State Network\n\nThe ESN [49] is a particular RNN [50] model whose name comes from the concept that the historical encoding of the past (hidden state) is “echoed” in the future summed to the current time step. The ESN is a model of the reservoir computing framework [51] that collects extremely efficient recurrent neural network models.\n\n3.1.1. Reservoir Computing\n\nReservoir computing models are characterized by an architecture divided into a reservoir and a readout. The reservoir represents the recurrent part that allows for encoding the temporal dependencies of time series and maps them into a vector with higher dimensionality called a hidden state. The readout can take the hidden state and provide the vector related to the prediction. The key concept that makes this framework efficient is related to the non-adaptability of the reservoir. Keeping the recurrent part of the network fixed can avoid the backpropagation through time (BPTT) learning function, which is related to issues of gradient vanishing and gradient exploding that are typical in RNN models [52]. The extremely high efficiency of the model allows us to use it in on-the-edge devices. The echo state network is a powerful reservoir computing model.\n\n3.1.2. Echo State Network\n\nIn the ESN model, the reservoir is seen as a dynamic system in which the hidden state is moved from each time step of the input according to the dynamics expressed by the reservoir function, also called the state transition function. The ESN is effective when the reservoir is contractive, satisfying the echo state property (ESP). ESP causes the reservoir to be dependent only on the driven input signal, forgetting the initial condition (the first hidden state, usually represented as h ( 0 ) ). An ESN model is depicted in Figure 1. The reservoir equation is formalized as\n\nh ( t ) = t a n h ( W x x ( t ) + W h h ( t − 1 ) + b h )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere t is the current time step, x ∈ R N x is the input time series, h ∈ R N h is the vector of the hidden state, W x ∈ R N h × N x is the matrix of input weights, W h ∈ R N h × N h is the matrix of recurrent weights, b h ∈ R N h is the bias vector of the reservoir, and t a n h is the non-linearity function. The ESN readout equation is formalized as\n\no ( t ) = W o h ( t ) + b o\n\n(2)\n\nwhere o ∈ R N o is the predicted output vector, W o ∈ R N o × N h is the matrix of readout weights, and b o ∈ R N h is the bias vector of the readout. The trained parameters are only W o and b o .\n\nAn efficient and effective training function used to fit the readout is the ridge regression, a one-shot training function formalized in the following way:\n\nW o = Y T H ( H T H + λ I ) − 1 b o = Y T s ( s T s + λ I ) − 1\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Y ∈ R N n × N o is the matrix of the output of the training set, H ∈ R N n × N h is the matrix of the hidden states, s ∈ R N n is a vector of ones, and λ is the scalar Thikonov regularization hyperparameter ( N n represents the number of examples in the training set).\n\n3.2. Long Short-Term Memory\n\nLSTM [53] is often considered an advancement of RNNs [54]. While RNNs offered short-term memory capabilities, allowing the use of preceding information at a specific point in time for the ongoing task, LSTM takes this a step further. In contrast to RNNs, LSTM architecture introduces the concept of long-term memory, providing access to a comprehensive history of previous information rather than just a snapshot at a specific time. This extended memory capacity enhances the learning and decision-making capabilities of the neural network.\n\n3.2.1. Long Short-Term Memory Model Efficiency\n\nLSTMs overcome the limitations related to the short-term memory of RNNs by introducing the concept of long-term memory. To train LSTM models and recurrent models in general, the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm is often used. This algorithm is known to be computationally expensive, as it involves backpropagation through the various time steps of the model, essentially treating the model as its “unrolled” version for each time step. This implies that the efficiency of BPTT directly depends on the number of time steps present in the time series being trained. However, it is important to note that training an LSTM model using BPTT may become impractical for IoT devices. These devices often have significant constraints in terms of memory and computing capacity. Deploying BPTT over long-term sequences can require computational and memory resources that exceed the capabilities of these devices, making it difficult or even impossible to implement such models on IoT platforms. Currently, computational problems are addressed using time-truncated backpropagation [55]. Despite its effectiveness in some contexts, BPTT is chosen due to its similarities with classical backpropagation [56]. This choice takes into account the computational constraints and resource limitations on IoT devices as well as the challenges associated with training over long time sequences.\n\n3.2.2. LSTM Architecture\n\nA typical LSTM model is illustrated in Figure 2. It comprises a cell, an input gate, an output gate, and a forget gate. Each of these components plays a crucial role in governing the flow of information within the network:\n\nCell State: This signifies the ongoing long-term memory of the network, retaining a list of past information.\n\nPrevious Hidden State: This refers to the output from the preceding time point, akin to short-term memory.\n\nInput Data: This includes the input value of the current time step.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the LSTM effectively manages both short-term and long-term memory, enabling more sophisticated learning and decision processes in neural networks (See Figure 2).\n\nThe recurrent part of LSTM is divided into three main gates (forget, input, and output), and each gate has the structure shown in Figure 3.\n\nA brief analysis of the different gates in the LSTM architecture is provided below. It is assumed that x ∈ R N x is the input of the system, and h ∈ R N x is the hidden state of the system.\n\n3.2.3. Forget Gate\n\nThe forget gate plays a crucial role in determining the relevance of bits in the cell state. It evaluates both the previous hidden state and the new input data to generate a vector with elements in the interval [0,1] by means of a sigmoid activation function ( σ ). Trained to output values close to 0 for irrelevant components and close to 1 for relevant ones, the outputs of the forget gate are multiplied by the previous state of the cell. Mathematically, the results ( f t ) of the forget gate are expressed as\n\nf ( t ) = σ ( W x f x ( t ) + W h f h ( t − 1 ) + b f )\n\n(4)\n\nwhere σ is the sigmoid activation function, W x f is the input weights, W h f is the recurrent weights, and b f is the bias of the forget gate.\n\n3.2.4. Input Gate\n\nThe input gate has two purposes: First, it evaluates whether it is worth keeping the new information in the cell state, and second, it decides what new information to add. The gate involves two processes. The first process generates a new memory update vector c ˜ by combining the previous hidden state and new input data using a tanh activation function. This vector determines how much each component of the cell state is updated. The process is expressed as\n\nc ˜ = t a n h ( W x x ( t ) + W h h ( t − 1 ) + b )\n\n(5)\n\nThe second process identifies which components of the new input are worth remembering, given the context of the previous hidden state. Similar to the forget gate, the input gate outputs a vector of values in the interval [0,1] using the sigmoid activation function:\n\ni ( t ) = σ ( W x i x ( t ) + W h i h ( t − 1 ) + b i )\n\n(6)\n\nwhere σ is the sigmoid activation function, W x i is the input weights, W h i is the recurrent weights, and b i is the bias of the input gate. These processes are combined through point-wise multiplication (here, the ⊙ symbol), and the resulting vector is added to the cell state, updating the long-term memory:\n\nc ( t ) = f ( t ) ⊙ c ( t − 1 ) + i ( t ) ⊙ c ˜\n\n(7)\n\n3.2.5. Output Gate\n\nAfter updating the long-term memory, the output gate determines the new hidden state. It uses the newly updated cell state, the previous hidden state, and the new input data. The output gate applies the previous hidden state and current input data through a sigmoid-activated network to obtain the filter vector o t . This vector is obtained as\n\no ( t ) = σ ( W x o x ( t ) + W h o h ( t − 1 ) + b o )\n\n(8)\n\nwhere σ is the sigmoid activation function, W x o is the input weights, W h o is the recurrent weights, and b o is the bias of the output gate. The cell state undergoes a tanh activation function to create a squished cell state, which is then multiplied point wise (⊙ symbol) with the filter vector to create the new hidden state h ( t ) :\n\nh ( t ) = o ( t ) ⊙ tanh ( c ( t ) )\n\n(9)\n\nThe new cell state c ( t ) becomes the previous cell state c ( t − 1 ) for the next LSTM unit, while the new hidden state h ( t ) becomes the previous hidden state h ( t − 1 ) for the subsequent LSTM unit. This process repeats until all time series sequences are processed by the LSTM cells.\n\n3.2.6. Key Differences between LSTM and ESN\n\nAs mentioned above, LSTM networks are very powerful but computationally intensive models suitable for applications involving complex long-range dependencies, while ESNs offer a more computationally efficient alternative when speed and computational efficiency are paramount. Indeed, LSTMs require backpropagation through time (BPTT) to train both the recurrent and output layers, while the ESNs use a simpler training approach in which the recurrent part is not trained and only the output weights are adjusted in a one-shot learning function called ridge regression, avoiding the complexities of BPTT. The main advantages of using ESN are as follows:\n\nFast training process\n\nLow computational cost\n\nFairly simple implementation\n\nSuitable for real-time applications\n\n4. Anomaly Detection Method Based on DeepESN\n\nThe proposed new AD methodology based on DeepESN is described in the following subsections.\n\n4.1. Deep Echo State Network\n\nA DeepESN model is shown in Figure 4. The DeepESN [57] is an echo state network model with more reservoir layers.\n\nApplying the deep learning paradigm [58] to the ESN model, it is possible to exploit multiple hidden states (one for each layer) related to different degrees of abstraction of the processed inputs. All of the reservoir layers are connected sequentially, meaning that the input of a deep reservoir layer is the hidden state of the previous one. All of the hidden states computed by all of the reservoirs are concatenated and passed to the readout for computing the prediction.\n\nThe DeepESN can be formalized by reusing the equations from Section 3.1.2, while the reservoir layers of the DeepESN can be formalized as follows:\n\nh l ( t ) = t a n h ( W x l h l − 1 ( t ) + W h l h l ( t − 1 ) + b h l )\n\n(10)\n\nwhere l is the number of layers, h 0 ( t ) = x ( t ) , and the hidden state of layer zero is the input time series. The readout maps the concatenation of the collection of all { h l ( t ) | l ∈ [ 1 , L ] } into the output prediction. It can be formalized as follows:\n\no ( t ) = W o [ h 1 ( t ) , ⋯ , h L ( t ) ] + b o\n\n(11)\n\nwhere W o ∈ R N o × L · N h , and the square parentheses represent the concatenation of the hidden state vectors in a unique vector with size L · N h . The ridge regression formula is the same as (3), where the only change is in terms of size, i.e., H ∈ R N n × L · N h .\n\n4.2. Anomaly Detector\n\nThe methodology introduced here aims to provide a way to detect anomalies in an unsupervised manner. The main architecture proposed is composed of two main parts: the deep learning model and the anomaly detector. The deep learning model is a RNN with a focus on comparing LSTM and ESN models and capable of performing a next-step prediction task taking x ( t − 1 ) as input and providing the prediction x ^ ( t ) . The anomaly detector takes as input the prediction of the deep learning model x ^ ( t ) , the related real input x ( t ) , and the standard deviation of errors of the training set σ and indicates class 0 for normal behavior or class 1 when it detects an anomaly. Going deeply into the anomaly detector (architecture shown in Figure 5), it performs the squared error between x ( t ) and x ^ ( t ) and adds it to a queue of fixed size Q. To detect the anomaly, the standard deviation ( q ) of the queue Q is computed resulting in a vector of 1 and 0 according to the condition q > ϵ σ . A vector is provided for the detection of anomalies for each feature.\n\n4.3. DeepESN Anomaly Detection Architecture\n\nThe whole architecture proposed here is composed of the DeepESN model and the anomaly detector. The three phases that make up the global architecture are represented in Figure 6. To work in the inference phase, the anomaly detector requires ϵ and σ as hyperparameters. To compute them and determine the best hyperparameters for the construction of the DeepESN model, the model selection and the model assessment phase are performed. For both of them, three steps must be performed (see Figure 6), and these are called, respectively, model training, σ computation, and the evaluation phase. During model selection, the performances of different combinations of hyperparameters are registered together with a related metric result in order to determine the best hyperparameters for the DeepESN model and the best ϵ hyperparameter. In this phase, the training set is used to train the model and to compute σ , while the evaluation phase is run with the validation set. The true σ used in inference is computed in the model assessment phase. In the model assessment phase, after retraining the model, it is initialized using the best selected hyperparameters, and σ is computed on the training set. The final evaluation phase is performed on the test set to retrieve the final results of the method’s performance.\n\nThe model training phase is described in Section 3 concerning preliminaries, while the computation of σ is conducted by taking the trained model and computing the prediction for each time series in the training set. Then, the predictions are compared with the true outputs to get the squared error. In the end, the standard deviation of all the squared errors, called σ , has been computed.\n\n4.4. Key Benefits of the DeepESN Architecture\n\nCompared with ESN, the DeepESN constrains the non-linear time series modeling capability of ESN by incorporating efficient deep learning functionality. The main advantages of using the DeepESN architecture are\n\nA deep layering of DeepESNs allows for the effective diversification of temporal representations in the layers of the hierarchy, amplifying the effects of the factors influencing the time scales and the richness of the dynamics, measured as the entropy of recurrent units’ activations [59].\n\nThe short-term memory capacity of DeepESN is higher than that of ESN. The short-term memory capacity is used to determine how well the most recent data (input) can be remembered based on the current context [60]. The number of recurrent units is quite similar in both the DeepESN and ESN mechanisms. However, experiments have demonstrated that the DeepESN mechanism exhibits a higher short-term memory capacity than the basic ESN [61].\n\nThe proposed DeepESN solution can be seen as a reduced form of the basic ESN model. Specifically, influences greater than one are eliminated from the initial layer to the reservoir, and connections between the higher layers and the lower states are removed, thereby ensuring fewer recurrent non-zero connections [62]. Furthermore, for both ESN and DeepESN (“layerization” of the ESN), the costs of updating each state are, respectively, O ( N T · L · N H 2 ) and O ( N T · L 2 · N H 2 ) [63], where N T is the number of time steps, L the number of layers, and N H the size of the reservoir. Given that ESN is a “layerization” of DeepESN, its reservoir size is L · N H . DeepESN demonstrates significantly lower costs compared to the basic ESN system. In fact, DeepESN surpasses the basic ESN in both computational efficiency and accuracy.\n\nOverall, the proposed DeepESN overcomes the standard ESN by increasing its computational efficiency, short-term memory capacity, and reservoir state richness. Accordingly, in this work it is proposed to use DeepESN to generate short-term predictions of electrical parameters. The general architecture of the proposed method, along with its associated input/output components, is depicted in Figure 7.\n\n4.5. Model Evaluation Metrics\n\nThe metrics proposed to quantify the obtained results can be divided into those that evaluate effectiveness and those that evaluate efficiency.\n\nEffectiveness metrics\n\nAll of the effectiveness metrics are executed on the test set. They are used to evaluate the entirety of the methodology performing a binary classification task. For this reason, we used the main metrics in binary classification scenarios, which are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The accuracy provides the percentage of correct predictions:\n\nA c c u r a c y = T P + T N T P + T N + F P + F N\n\n(12)\n\nwhere T P stands for true positive, T N for true negative, F P for false positive (1), and F N for false negative (0). The precision provides the percentage of true positives out of all positive predictions:\n\nP r e c i s i o n = T P T P + F P\n\n(13)\n\nThe recall provides the percentage of true positives out of all positive real examples:\n\nR e c a l l = T P T P + F N\n\n(14)\n\nThe F1 score provides a balance between precision and recall:\n\nF 1 = 2 · P r e c i s i o n · R e c a l l P r e c i s i o n + R e c a l l = 2 T P 2 T P + F P + F N\n\n(15)\n\nEfficiency metrics\n\nThe metrics used to evaluate the efficiency of the methodology include time-related measures and CO2 emissions. In terms of time, the seconds spent to train the model on the training set (training time) and those spent to predict all the results of the test set (inference time) have been measured. The time metric tells us how fast the model is during the training and inference phases. Additionally, the CO2 emissions are measured during the training phase and inference phase. This metric indicates the volume of carbon dioxide emissions (kgCO2) generated during the training and inference process. The CO2 emissions are computed starting from power resource consumption. Specifically, the emissions are measured using the codecarbon python library version 2.7.1, which allows for the registration of the kWh for the CPU and RAM of the device. kWh are converted into CO2 emissions by multiplying them by the carbon intensity of the current country in kg/kWh. The formula used is the following:\n\nemissions = ( CPU _ kWh + RAM _ kWh ) · cci\n\n(16)\n\nCPU _ kWh and RAM _ kWh are monitored and measured during the run, while the country’s carbon intensity (cci) is a constant taken from the work in [64] where are the carbon intensity of each country is listed. In our case, the cci is 0.373 kg/kWh, which is the carbon intensity for Italy in the year 2022.\n\n5. Experimental Setup\n\nThis section provides details of the experiment, including the real system hardware architecture, the devices involved in the proposed method, the environment setup, and the list of all energy variables acquired from the field. In detail, Section 5.1 describes the case study and the hardware on the edge, while in Section 5.1.1, the pilot case composed of a production line and the energy acquisition module is introduced. Subsequently, in Section 6, the data type and acquisition methods are highlighted.\n\n5.1. Case Study\n\nThe proposed solution has been applied to a real test case composed of four actors that, when combined, allow for the creation of an infrastructure that can be replicated in many other industrial scenarios. The experimental setup consists of four actors. The first is the production line. It is the main system to be monitored in order to analyze the electrical parameters of the AD. The second actor is a smart meter module, which is directly connected both to the three-phase electrical connections of the industrial machine and to the third actor, the Raspberry Pi, using a Modbus TCP/IP protocol. The results of the AD are then sent to the fourth actor, the cloud, for further analysis and notification. In addition to this, to test and debug the proposed solution on the edge, the interconnection between the embedded device and the S604 module is not established directly but instead passes through the local area network (see Figure 7).\n\nIn the next paragraphs, the production line and the smart monitoring module are described.\n\n5.1.1. Pilot Case\n\nThe proposed solution has been tested on a production line used for the production of metal filters by SIFIM Srl (Jesi, Ancona, Italy), an Italian company leader which specializes in the production of this type of component for the household appliances industry and community kitchen industry (restaurant, hotels, canteens, etc.). SIFIM’s production line can be divided into three functional blocks associated with the three production phases (See Figure 8):\n\nLoading station: This is where the iron, steel, or aluminum sheet coil is loaded onto a decoiler.\n\nWork area: This is composed of a punching press that creates the weave of the metal mesh and a straightening area in which the mesh, passing through opposing rollers, is stretched and flattened.\n\nUnloading station: Here, a winding reel collects the coil of metal mesh produced.\n\nThe first and the third module are equipped with a 3 kw and 3.5 kw three-phase asynchronous motor, respectively, while the second module uses four different types of motors: two three-phase asynchronous motors (one of 11.5 kw for the main activity and the other of 0.7 kw to manage the back-and-forth movement of the press in relation to the desired settings) and two brushless motors (2 kw and 0.7 kw) used to control the oscillation and lateral displacement of the press head. The production line overall has an average consumption ranging from 5 to 8 amps depending on the type of material used to produce the filters and the production velocity (aluminum, stainless steel, etc.). In fact, even though the nominal power of the production line is over 25 kw, the actuators work only for a few milliseconds in a time range of one second.\n\n5.1.2. Data Acquisition\n\nThe acquisition system has been chosen for the proposed approach based on the flexibility and manageability that an industrial monitoring system should have. Generally, a production line does not have a complete acquisition system containing all the information about the state of all variables involved in the process but instead exposes only a few details related to the production state, such as the production ID, the alarms, the on/off state, the number of items to be produced, etc. [65,66]. In addition to this, installing sensors on the production line can be expensive from an economic point of view and sometimes invasive in terms of wiring and CE certification. Based on these considerations, an energy IoT monitoring module, the S604 by Seneca [67], that includes a three-phase network analyzer, has been installed following the electrical connection guidelines as shown in Figure 9.\n\nThe module carries out one reading per second of over 250 different electrical parameters (current, voltage, power factor, displacement power factor, active energy, etc.) and performs calculations (every ten seconds) to define complex variables such as the minimum, maximum, or average value of another 150 variables. Furthermore, the harmonic calculation is performed every seven seconds. Due to the limited hardware resources, only 88 variables are acquired every second, as listed in Table 1.\n\nIn the Figure 10, some values of the acquired variables during the operational tests are shown. Next, the data are saved in a csv file and organized by day in order prepare the dataset for feeding into the proposed model.\n\n6. Materials and Methods\n\nThis section consists of a detailed explanation of the data and data preparation (Section 6.1), the hyperparameter settings (Section 6.2), and the model training and inference phase for the proposed solution (Section 6.3).\n\n6.1. Data Preparation and Preprocessing\n\nThe raw data are represented by the matrix X = [ x 1 , x 2 … x N T ] , where N T is the number of time steps during which each x t ∈ R N x , where N x is the number of input features. The raw data come directly from the field, and in order to use them as an input for the model, it is important to prepare the data in a correct way. In fact, even though there are many available techniques for data scaling, choosing the best scaling method continues to be one of the most challenging problems because the performance of ML algorithms and the selection of standardization methods are interconnected [68,69,70]. For the proposed approach, based on the reduced computational resources available, six different types of data preparation are used:\n\nData rectification:\n\nGenerally, when the machine is not running, it is not turned off, and therefore, the data, such as voltage, frequency, etc., continue to have a non-zero value. Analyzing the data when the machine is not working, when the phase current is equal to zero, is useless for our purposes, so, in order to reduce the size of the time series, the data during the off period have been removed.\n\nData cleaning:\n\nThe whole dataset not only contains information about electrical parameters but also generic information such as serial numbers, IDs, and time information is not useful. This type of information does not support analysis of the anomaly estimation.\n\nData operation:\n\nA type of data operation has been performed in order to adjust the values of the numerical columns of the dataset to a standard scale. Specifically, the data has been standardized to a probability distribution in which the mean is zero and the standard deviation is 1 according to Equation (17):\n\nX s t d = X − μ X σ X\n\n(17)\n\nwhere μ X ∈ R N x is the mean, and σ X ∈ R N x is the standard deviation of the time series.\n\nDataset splitting:\n\nThe dataset consisted of 269 time series ( N n ) with 300 time steps ( N t ) and 88 features ( N x ). The training set is about 60%, and the validation and test sets are about 20% and 20%, respectively.\n\nData labeling:\n\nThe validation and test sets present faults from halfway through the time series to the end. These anomalies are emulated by summing the noise with the original time series. The noise is generated from a normal distribution and is multiplied by 20% of the standard deviation of the dataset. Class 0 is used for no faults and Class 1 for the added faults.\n\n6.2. Hyperparameter Settings\n\nBased on the recommendations presented in [71,72], the hyperparameters for DeepESN and LSTM are obtained using the trial-and-error method. This method achieves satisfactory results by trying different hyperparameter combinations until the error is sufficiently reduced, which is effective and frequently used in hyperparameter setting [73,74]. This phase is called model selection, and the hyperparameter combinations are used to initialize and train new models on the training set and evaluate them on the validation set. In our case, being a binary classification method, instead of using an error minimization technique, we decided to leverage the accuracy metric in order to choose the best hyperparameter configuration that maximizes it (See Table 2).\n\n6.3. Training Phase\n\nIn the initial training phase, several hyperparameters are explored for experimentation with the LSTM and DeepESN models. This in-depth analysis allows us to identify the optimal combination that leads to superior levels of accuracy. The optimal hyperparameters are identified through a targeted experimentation phase in order to maximize the performance of the LSTM and DeepESN models on the specific tasks to which they were applied. In the training phase, the model is adapted to predict the next step (next-step prediction). Training occurs using the training set, allowing the model to learn temporal relationships in the input data. In particular, for LSTM, the mean squared error (MSE) is used as the loss function, and Adam is used as the optimizer, while for DeepESN, the learning function is the one-shot ridge regression learning rule. After training, the next step is the calculation of errors in the training set, measuring the discrepancy between the model predictions and the respective time steps of the training set. These errors are recorded in a buffer, and the standard deviation is generated. This step is crucial for the dynamic calculation of the sigma value, which will subsequently be used to verify anomalies. The standard deviation of the errors of the time steps of the training set ( σ ) and of the queue (queue, q ) is not a single value but a vector of standard deviations, each associated with a specific feature (in our case, a composite vector from the 88 features of the time series). This approach allows for more accurate anomaly detection, since the detection process is performed separately for each feature in the time series. A visual representation of vectors is shown in Figure 11.\n\nInference Phase\n\nDuring this phase, the trained model is combined with the anomaly detector to work in a real case. This phase is described by Algorithm 1.\n\nIn this scenario, each time a new time step arrives in the stream, it is processed by the deep learning model, which provides the prediction of the next step. The result is passed to the anomaly detector with the real value of the next step, which arrives in the following moment. The anomaly detector generates a ( t ) , the vector that contains the predictions of anomalies for each feature at time step t. Fixing a certain threshold f d , a general anomaly can be identified when more features than the threshold f d are detected as failures.\n\nAlgorithm 1 Inference phase pseudocode σ standard deviation of errors in the training set ϵ hyperparameter related to the threshold of standard deviation error Q queue of last errors M trained model (DeepESN or LSTM) f d threshold of feature detected to send a notification of the anomaly for new input x n e w do x ^ ← M ( x o l d ) next step prediction e ← ( x n e w − x ^ ) 2 computation of current error Q . p u s h ( e ) addition of error in the queue Q q ← s t d ( Q ) computation of standard deviation of Q a ← q > ϵ σ anomaly detection for each feature if s u m ( a ) > f d then send_notification() end if x o l d ← x n e w end for\n\n7. Results and Discussion\n\nExperimental results are discussed in this section as well as comparative analysis among low-level and high-level models. In Table 3, the results of each metric described in Section 4.5 for the use of the DeepESN (our proposal) and LSTM (state-of-the-art) models in combination with the anomaly detector are described.\n\nThe first results are related to effectiveness, while the latter results are related to efficiency. Regarding effectiveness metrics, our proposal is better than the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1 score, respectively, by around 2%, 9%, and 4%, while is worse in terms of precision by around 5%. In general, from the point of view of effectiveness, the use of DeepESN brings about better results than LSTM, except in terms of precision. In terms of efficiency, the use of DeepESN is better than the LSTM model. The time measured in training is improved by three orders of magnitude, while the time spent in inference is less than one-third of the state-of-the-art. Regarding CO2 emissions, our proposal outperforms the state-of-the-art by two orders of magnitude in the training phase and one order of magnitude in the inference phase. Efficiency results prove that our proposal is highly efficient with respect to the state-of-the-art. This consideration promotes the usage of our proposal directly in on-the-edge devices instead of exploiting a remote server both for training and inference. The LSTM model is trained using the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, while the DeepESN model uses the ridge regression algorithm. BPTT is iterative (the iterations of the algorithm are called epochs), while ridge regression is one-shot. In the following analysis, the performance of the LSTM model combined with the anomaly detector during the iterations of training is compared with the one-shot-trained DeepESN.\n\nFigure 12 shows the evolution of accuracy and F1 score for the effectiveness metrics and time and CO2 emissions for the efficiency metrics. In all the plots, the x-axis is related to the epochs of the BPTT training algorithm, while the y-axis is related to the analyzed metric. The accuracy and F1 score metrics are computed on the test set, and they show that DeepESN outperforms LSTM at each epoch of training. In terms of efficiency, a low result is desired for both time and CO2 emissions. Both in terms of time and CO2 emissions, the LSTM is inefficient at the first epoch. Over the course of subsequent epochs, which bring with them an improvement in effectiveness, the methodology becomes more and more expensive, with a linear increase. The inefficiency of the BPTT algorithm promotes its usage inside of a server, while our proposal can be implemented directly inside of on-the-edge devices due to its good efficiency. In order to emphasize the results obtained, a graphic visualization has been chosen. In the representation, the left side of the graph offers a comparison between the two models, DeepESN and LSTM, regarding standard deviation.\n\nIn the legend, the standard deviation values are indicated as follows:\n\nq: Standard deviation of the error.\n\nAnomaly threshold: This represents the average of the values used to calculate the upper (+ σ ). This dashed green band indicates the range in which the standard deviation of the error must remain in order to prevent a failure from occurring.\n\nActual anomaly: This indicates the start of the actual anomaly.\n\nPredicted anomaly: This indicates the start of the predicted anomaly.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the graph, the time series values are presented, with the following legend:\n\nEffective time series: This represents the actual trend of the time series.\n\nPredicted time series: This shows the predicted trend of the time series.\n\nActual anomaly: This indicates the start of the actual anomaly.\n\nPredicted anomaly: This signals the start of the predicted anomaly.\n\nThis visual representation provides a clear comparison between the two models in terms of standard deviation and offers a detailed overview of the temporal trend of the time series, highlighting both actual and predicted anomalies. The analysis begins by focusing on the system current as the first feature. As highlighted in Figure 13, although both models show a similar trend in the time series, the DeepESN presents timelier error detection. The prediction of the time series by DeepESN has a slightly more indented behavior than the LSTM model. DeepESN allows us to find the fault before LSTM because after the effective fault, the prediction starts to look very different from the effective time series.\n\nA further indicator used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model is the confusion matrix (CM), which allows for the calculation of metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy, providing a detailed view of the classification errors. As shown in Table 4, the percentage of F N is higher than F P , confirming the lower value of recall with respect to precision.\n\nAnother useful indicator is the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shown in Figure 14. It shows that the model is effective in distinguishing between positive and negative instances.\n\nIndeed, the area under the curve (AUC) score, equal to 77 % , further quantifies its performance, showing that the proposed model correctly ranks a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a negative instance 77 % of the time.\n\n8. Conclusions\n\nThis work presented a novel methodology for anomaly detection, leveraging the combination of a deep learning model and an anomaly detector. The deep learning model, implemented as a RNN, was compared with both LSTM and DeepESN architectures, with our findings demonstrating the superiority of the proposed DeepESN approach. This architecture proved to be not only efficient but also faster and lightweight, making it well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained embedded devices at the edge. The anomaly detector, a critical component of our framework, exhibited its effectiveness in distinguishing normal behavior from anomalies based on the comparison of predicted and real inputs, further augmented by the standard deviation of errors. The three-phase model selection and model assessment approach facilitated the identification of optimal hyperparameters, ensuring the robustness and adaptability of the deep learning model. The introduction of DeepESN, a hybrid model combining efficient deep learning functionality with the strengths of ESN, proved advantageous. DeepESN exhibited enhanced temporal representation diversification, powerful short-term memory capacity, and amplified computing efficiency compared to the baseline ESN mechanism. These advantages position DeepESN as a formidable choice for the short-term forecasting of electrical parameters within our proposed methodology. Experimental results showcased the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal, particularly when compared to the state-of-the-art LSTM model. Despite the slight superiority of LSTM in the mean squared error metric, our approach demonstrated comparable effectiveness metrics, with notable improvements in efficiency. The significant reduction in training time and CO2 emissions highlights the potential environmental and cost benefits of our proposed methodology. In summary, our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of our proposed approach, making it a compelling solution for on-the-edge deployment, directly addressing the limitations of traditional server-based implementations. The proposed methodology, grounded in the robustness of DeepESN and the efficiency of the anomaly detector, sets the stage for advancements in real-time anomaly detection on resource-constrained devices at the edge of the network. However, although the initial findings are promising, there is still a need for further exploration with objectives such as:\n\nMonitoring the production line as different types of items are manufactured, linking time-series data to the specific products being produced;\n\nLabeling all types of faults and malfunctions to continuously improve the performance of the AD model;\n\nImplementing a continuous learning technique to enable the model to update itself and adapt to temporal changes in the degradation of the production line.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nMethodology, A.B., M.P. and S.L.; validation, A.B., M.P., G.P. and L.L.; formal analysis, A.B. and M.P.; investigation, M.P., L.F., R.K., G.P. and L.L.; resources, M.P., G.P., L.F., R.K., L.L., A.B. and C.V.; data curation, G.P., L.L. and C.V.; writing—original draft preparation, M.P., G.P. and L.L.; writing—review and editing, A.B. and M.P.; visualization, A.B. and M.P.; supervision, M.P., A.B. and S.L.; project administration, A.B. and M.P.

      "# [Data synthesis for SOTA LLMs with Karan Malhotra, researcher at Nous Research (Practical AI #255) on 2024-02-06](https://changelog.com/practicalai/255)\nYeah. Prior to LLaMA, everyone’s like “Oh, Facebook - evil. My data” etc. And here we are, they are kind of like the shepherds of this new era of open source AI movement. So when LLaMA came out, there was a paper that came out called Alpaca, by Stanford Lab. And this was about distilling data from bigger models, like GPT 3, ChatGPT, GPT 4, and being able to train smaller models on that distilled, synthetic data; something they called instruction data. So the Alpaca format really opened up the playing field for everybody to start making these instruct-style models, these actual for-prod use style models.\n\n[ ] So there was an idea I had in my head of like “Well, the Alpaca guys are using only GPT 3.5 outputs. What if I only generated GPT 4 outputs? It will be a little expensive, but you’ll probably get a better model out of it than Alpaca.” At the same time that I was looking at this, there was a guy on Twitter named Technium, who had just started putting together his own synthetic dataset based off Alpaca, and the GPT 4 only as well. So I was working with a group at the time called Open Assistant, under LAION. They’re a really big nonprofit. And while I was working on that, we had some GPUs they were cool with us using towards the development of new models.\n\nSo I reached out to Technium and I said “Hey, I have a little bit of compute. You have GPT 4 data in the same format, I have GPT 4 data in the same format. Let’s train a model.” So we trained a model called gpt4-vicuna. This model was on the Vicuna fine-tune; we fine-tuned the fine-tune, basically. The Vicuna model was an Alpaca-style fine-tune, and we tried our dataset on top of it. It was good, it was okay… But then we thought “We’ll probably get a better result if we just train on the base LLaMA model.” And the resulting model was the very first Hermes model.\n\nThe OG. And that’s kind of how it started to come together, was we both had a data thesis on “Use GPT 4 only, and follow Alpaca.” And we trained on LLaMA, and we got Hermes. And we didn’t know what benchmarks were; we didn’t know anything about any of this stuff. We just made a model. And it got a ton of attention. We put it out under this name, Nous Research. Nous comes from the Greek word for intellect. We thought it would be a good name for an AI company. [laughter] But it was just a place for fun projects, and fine-tunes, and stuff. It was just a name we were using for our collaboration. And people started swarming and asking “What’s Nous Research? What’s this sudden, mystical open source organization that put out this best model?” And we’re like “Best model? We just tried something.” It was really organic. And it got to the point that people started telling us “You must have trained on the benchmarks. These are doing too well.” And we were like “What’s benchmarks?” [laugh] We were not really coming from an academic place as much as from like an enthusiast that became so committed that it became our life. It became our day to day.\n\nSo from there, people started to ask us “Can I join Nous Research?” Now, there wasn’t a Nous Research to join. It was just two guys, right? What ended up happening was we formed a private Discord server, and we thought “There’s a lot of people, who range from somebody who’s like 16-17 years old, savant on Twitter, hasn’t even been a college yet, insane at transformer stuff, to mid 30s, working a really, really good FAANG-esque job, and just wants to really create and let loose.” That was another class of volunteer. And then you have older gentleman, who has already exited a company or something, who has just been playing with code for a while and wants to jump in and hang out.\n\nSo we ended up being this really eclectic group. We don’t know what your name is, we don’t know what your race is, we don’t know your gender, or anything. It’s just Discord profile picture, Twitter profile picture, right? So we came together, grew to about like 40 people, all working together on various different projects, like Hermes tunes, data synthesis, the Capybara series, context length extension etc. And just from this kind of interaction between Twitter and Discord, and bringing people in that we thought were cool, we ended up becoming what people would call an open source research org. [laughs]\n\nYeah, absolutely. I mean, out of context, synthetic is like as meaningless as artificial, right? Data is data. But in this case, it’s referring to a particular class of data that’s been generated by another language model, or another AI, another diffusion model etc, that can actually be used to further train models. Now, you might say, “Why would you want to do something like that? How is it helpful?” What was important to us is we were all GPU-poor. We were all running on laptops, or maybe a 3090, maybe a 4090. As individuals, we don’t have data centers. So training or even tuning a large model in the early days, like 70 billion parameters, something like that was just unfeasible for us. And knowing that GPT 3 has something like 175 billion parameters, and 3.5 and 4 can only go up from there, the question became “How can we make these small 7-billion parameter models even compete with these massive, massive ones?” These ones that I want to run offline, these ones that I might want to run on an edge device, on a phone, on a drone etc. How can I make them even useful? So there’s two things to talk about here. One is synthetic data, and the other is distillation.\n\nSo synthetic data is just referring to any kind of data that’s created by a model, in this case. And the reason that’s useful is in particular distillation. So if I told you to go study comp-sci for 10 years, for example, and put in that massive time investment, and really focus on general programming. And then I told you “Now it’s time for you to learn about AI, and transformers and stuff” and put you through all the math prerequisites etc. you’re gonna come out with like a really strong foundation of how to do the work. But the problem is, you’ve put in a massive time investment.\n\nNow, if I take that guy, who’s spent 10 years doing engineering, then another five years doing AI, and I ask him “Hey, can you teach somebody just the really important, compressed tidbits that will help them just get up and running to do the work?” That’s data distillation. That’s knowledge distillation.\n\nSo you look at these big models, like a Claude, or 70B model, or GPT 4, and you can see they’re amazing, they’re brilliant at everything. They have a bunch of high-quality data they’re trained on, and they have a bunch of low-quality data they’re trained on, that they can interact with an express in a high-quality form. So instead of me having to read a massive 10-pager for why some chemical reaction or some like tax base process, whatever you want it to be - instead of reading a massive document on that, and then feeding that to a language model, we can just have that really smart model that already understands it really well compress that information into an instruction, or into a conversation, into like two sentences, three sentences, five sentences, half a page. And we can just train a much smaller model on that compressed information, and it will learn the compressed information, to the degree that a language model learns something; not perfectly, but…\n\n[ ] Because of that, what the Alpaca guys did was they generated a bunch of seed tasks from GPT 3.5 on various different domains and topics, and created these kind of compressed instructions, with instruction, an input question from the user, and then an answer. So the instruction could be like “Given the following math equation, explain step by step why this is the answer.” And then the input is the equation, which is your question, and then the output is the compressed answer. So all of that, we can take as one sample in the dataset, and we can make hundreds of thousands or millions of samples like that, of various different domains and various different tasks.\n\nSo the Alpaca guys did this, less than 100k examples, I believe, and they trained the LLaMA models on these, and they found massive boosts to performance, that this distilled information, like a human, successfully compresses and transfers over. So when I saw that, and then independently when Technium saw that, and then independently when many others saw that, we were like “This is so intuitive. This is exactly how I’ve learned anything, by just going on Discord and Twitter and bothering people to give me the compressed bit of how I do something. We should try doing this with even higher-quality models than 3.5.”\n\nSo we created - I can’t remember the exact number at the moment, but at least 50,000, maybe 100,000 examples originally, for Hermes 1, like this, just using GPT 4. And then we trained on that, and ended up getting performance that was extremely, extremely massive boost compared to the other models that were not trained using this kind of method.\n\nSo without these giants that have already established themselves in this space, we wouldn’t be here. Without Open AI, without Meta, we literally wouldn’t have the model and the data to do the kind of work that we did to make Hermes.\n\nWhat it allowed for us is like for local models to finally be comprehensible, and for us to finally have offline capabilities, to kind of take the good stuff from something like GPT 4 or something else and make it uncensored. So it still has all this understanding of all these topics, but it doesn’t have all that RLHF inside it necessarily, that safety-izes it, so that when people utilize the model, it has all this intelligence, but it has more freedom of thought to kind of converse with you on topics that Open AI may reject.\n\nI think that, of course, generally, US and international regulation on this stuff is evolving; the conversation is evolving very much. So naturally, you have to keep it top of mind; you have to think about these kinds of things. But thankfully, because all of our model releases are like open source, and we don’t profit from them… Like, if somebody goes off and creates a product using our model, good for them, but we don’t necessarily take on that liability or that worry of saying “Hey, we’re gonna sell you this model that was created with GPT 4 outputs.” We actually actively try to stay away from doing that. But because the data distillation paradigm is so effective… You know, if a model comes out that’s better than GPT 4, and it’s open source, and I can use it locally, and in their TOS it says “You can use this to make a commercial model”, that we can apply the same techniques that we’ve been preparing and researching and understanding from these closed models, and use it there.\n\n[ ] So right now, we don’t stand to, or try to, or have any plans to profit from using any of these outputs. We’re not about that, because we want to be careful and respectful of these model creators and these companies. But that being said, we’re learning all these techniques and developing all these techniques that will be useful for when that time comes, and for when that’s available, especially with the advent of something like Mistral. If we do distillation from a Mistral model, like Mistral Medium, or something like that, that’s completely, from my understanding - barring their TOS saying otherwise, but I believe it doesn’t - it’s completely okay in that situation for us to create models like this, that can be used commercially etc. Regarding the TOS stuff though, as much as we err on the side of caution, I’d find it hard to see a company enforce their TOS when these larger models are likely trained on not all copyright-free stuff. I’d find it hard-pressed to believe that these closed source companies, their models are totally copyright-free, and totally copyright-clean.\n\nSo if some other company that was feeling a little more rambunctious than ourselves was to say “We’re going to commercially release on this”, I imagine it’d be difficult for them to be come after without the other group opening their books. And there’s actually a pretty interesting interaction that happened regarding this between Google and Open AI, if you guys are familiar. [laughs]\n\nCertainly, certainly. So within the stuff that’s viewable on Hugging Face at least, we’ve got the Hermes series, of which - I told you guys the initial story of how it went down, but from there, Technium kept going. I haven’t personally had any interaction with the Hermes model since the initial. From there, Tech just continued to create more and more synthetic data, collect from more and more sources, use more and more open datasets… And he’s just got the, I guess, award-winning data thesis. The guy really knows how to go about curating and synthesizing good data.\n\nSo Technium - it’s his baby, the Hermes project. So everything you’ve seen since is really – his work, and anyone who has kind of collaborated with him, but almost… You can’t call anything a solo project, because of the open datasets were used, too. Everything is built on the shoulders of giants, and the shoulders of each other as little people… But Tech really has helmed the Hermes initiative so far. I think that’s our most popular model series, and he released the Open Hermes as well, because we had some data in the original Hermes that we never released publicly, and we wanted to make that kind of an option for everybody. So that’s Hermes… It still follows the same kind of philosophy of synthetic data, and it now uses the ChatML format, instead of the Alpaca format. It’s what we kind of upgraded to.\n\nThen you’ve got a Capybara and Puffin, which are both done by a volunteer and OG member, LDJ. You may be familiar with Luigi Danielle Jr. So the Capybara series was using an amplify instruct method, this novel method that LDJ had worked on alongside another one of our researchers, J. So LDJ and J - it can get confusing, but the two of them worked on the Capybara series, created the dataset, trained the models. And then Puffin was the idea of using handpicked, smaller samples from some of our larger datasets to make sleek datasets for an easy tune, and see how that works kind of in the spirit of the Lima paper, where they just used a few examples to get really good results.\n\nThose are really the popular tunes using synthetic data for like general use. Yarn is this novel context length extension method at the time of creation by [unintelligible ] and EleutherAI. So what happened there was these guys were already looking into context extension for a while, and when we kind of came under the Nous banner to do the work, it opened up a little bit of resources from compute sponsorships, it opened up a more centralized place for them to be able to do that collaboration…\n\n[ ] I had no hand in the Yarn models whatsoever. And that’s the exciting thing, is everyone really gets to work in their own spheres, in their own kind of autonomous circles, and then we just check in and see “How’s the research going? How’s it coming along?” Because we really work with people that we heavily believe in, and we believe in their idea… So if we don’t already have an idea, we kind of just say “Please freely create, because we brought you in, because what you will freely create will push forth our agenda anyway.”\n\nSo I think those are our big model releases and series that we have available. Outside of that, we have a bunch of stuff on our GitHub as well. Stuff that’s being worked on, stuff that hasn’t necessarily come out yet… There’s a lot of that. [laughs]\n\nYeah, absolutely. I mean, when it started, it was just like a small Discord. Maybe like 10 people. From there, we kind of created more channels, as people wanted to work on more things… And we had initially split up into three or four different topics or sectors that people could assign themselves to. One being data synthesis, of course, so we can kind of find new, novel methods and formats for distillation, and the creation of synthetic data. One being training, like people who are just like really good at training, hyperparam stuff, and people who will come up with new architectures and new techniques. Another being agents - a group of people who want to actually try to build tools, and do autonomous work with this stuff…\n\nAnd then we had this one category that - it was a prediction for the future of simulation. So we had people that were very interested in kind of bringing this stuff into simulation, into Unity, into kind of seeing how all these things came together. And it was interesting, because the training built on the data synthesis, the agents built on the training, and then the sim would build on the agents. It was kind of the idea. So everybody needed to work together, because all those things are so intrinsically connected… But people would have specializations on kind of where in that workflow they wanted to work.\n\nWe didn’t end up doing a lot on the sim side of things. Now, recently, there’s a lot more interest, because we have a lot more capability, generally, as the AI community does… But as we’ve grown to - we went to 40 people, it was fine. Now we’ve gone to like 5,000 people in the Discord… It’s a little unwieldy there. So what we do is we kind of tier people in. You come into the Discord, you can see maybe two channels. And then we’ll give people a developer role. We don’t really let people select their own roles, because we want to make sure we can kind of sort through people we know, to kind of let them through… And even as we do open source research, a lot of it is unreleased, and we want to make sure that it’s kind of protected before release. So we created this developer role so people can then see like way more channels of just general development, and development conversation.\n\nAnd from there, as we see contributors who have started to do more work, or show more passion towards contributing to Nous in a particular field, or who have some reputation or some portfolio in a particular field, then we’ll assign them one of those roles. And that will open up the family of channels relating to those roles, and our current projects surrounding that role. So like data synthesis projects, agent projects, training projects etc. So we kind of just tier it out, so people can interact.\n\nAnd people who have been around for a while, or people we consider fellows, or part of the cohort, they can usually see pretty much everything. So they’re pretty effective in serving as coordinators for the cross-communication between these different channels and groups. And even if someone has a particular role or some channel has a particular role it’s supposed to be a part of, it’s still Discord, and we’re still very chill. So people will still work on like various different overlaps inside of just one channel as well.\n\nI think that definitely just like straight up instruction tuning is great. There’s other ways to tune, like the eval instruct method. I would advise people to try to create new instruction methodologies, that allow us to make even better formatted data. People don’t spend enough time trying to create new instruct formats. And we’ve definitely been swamped with not doing that as well. So I think towards the general community, it’s a really easy place to get started; you don’t need to really know how to code, so much as think about how a human might more effectively phrase something, or format something, and kind of remix from there. I think that’s probably the easiest place to start.\n\nThen there’s model merging. Model merging is great. You can just like take two models and Frankenstein them together to question-mark results. You’ve got to just try and see what happens, and feel it out. Then from there, I would say there’s stuff like DPO, there’s RLHF… DPO kind of rewards things; that can let you enable rejections, or create censorship, or put some kind of general concept or attitude towards a model. We’ve found that to be pretty effective with the latest News Hermes Mistral DPO. It seems like people really like it and prefer it over just SFT. So that’s another thing that I’d heavily recommend.\n\nFrom there, we get a little more complex. We have some reward model stuff we’re working on that I won’t speak to just yet, outside of saying we’re working on it, that we think is going to be like pretty big for reasoning boosts. Of course, there’s techniques like chain of thought, and tree of thought, for like multi-step prompting. Creating datasets even out of that for any of these purposes I’ve already mentioned is going to be really effective.\n\nNow, to stuff that maybe not everybody can – actually, a lot of people would already be able to do this. There’s something that we like to call over at Nous activations hacking, where you’re kind of messing with the way that a model – I’m trying to think about how to say this in like the most layman’s terms… You’re trying to mess with how a model generally vibes about something. [laughs] So rather than just doing a system prompt or something like that, you can actually change the model vectors to kind of be like more political about something, less political about something, more terse, or more specific… And it has far more effect and control over a model than a system prompt. It’s basically like a system prompt that tells it to embody certain characteristics, but it’s not something you can really jailbreak or get around, as far as my testing has shown. Certainly not as easily as a system prompt. We have no problem jailbreaking even the most censored closed models today. It can be done by anybody, with the right words. But this activation stuff, it really creates a bit more of a robustness and fidelity to the concepts that you’re trying to tell it to embody.\n\nThere’s a few more I’m trying to think of that would be useful for people… One thing is soft prompting. It’s not really around anymore. It used to be pretty big during the GPT-J, like pre-LLaMA days, and the Cobalt AI guys really pioneered the use of it in the open source community. But a soft prompt basically takes like a massive prompt and it compresses it down to like way less tokens. So you can give your model like a huge prompt, a huge system prompt, or a huge amount of information, and use like way less tokens. So soft prompting is cool. It’s not going to be too difficult to update it for like LLaMA, Mistral, today’s architectures. Nobody’s really done it that I’ve seen. So to the community, if you guys do that, please share. [laughs] That’s actually much easier than the activation stuff, I think.\n\nAnd then finally, probably the hardest unsolved is sampling methods. Today we use like Top-K, Top-P, [unintelligible ] sampling etc, whatever. There’s better ways to pick tokens, for sure. There’s better ways to judge the value of tokens, for sure. Everyone has been too concerned with higher levels to get that low, and do whatever the magic math is that I can’t do, that would enable some steering, and some – even beyond steering, like alternative sampling paradigms. And I think that would probably bring the biggest change and transformation to literally all models, regardless of the tune, regardless of the architecture etc. if it gets pulled off. So I’m really looking forward to something like that happening in the space.\n\nThen we’ll distill, and then we’ll run the AGI on your Neuralink, on your contact lens, or something. [laughter] But for us, there’s a huge focus on locality, there’s a huge focus on offline, there’s a huge focus on take the power back, run the model yourself, do everything at home… That’s big for us. And at the same time, of course, we believe in scale. But there’s this idea that there’s so much unsolved at the small model size; why don’t we do that before we go to a trillion params? Because we can scale those realizations.\n\nBut for us, there’s certainly a transformation and change in attitude, and in pressures from going from pure open source volunteer, to as well having kind of this more corporate branch get created as well. But that being said, it’s been pretty consistent, our ethos and our motivation for why we do this. And like you said, it really was organic, in the sense that we’re a product of the times, we’re a product of the atmosphere of the AI community. People have said nice things, like “You guys are setting the trend.” And it’s not really true, so much as the truth is we are one of many embodiments of the sentiment that the community has, and that the world has, we think.\n\n[ ] There’s more than one Nous Research in this world. There’s Alignment Labs, there’s Pygmalion, there’s Cobalt; there’s people who have been around before us, people who will come along the way, people who have already formed since we have… And there’s lots of people who have kind of embodied the Nous Research ethos. And it’s not really just our ethos, as much as the overall community’s ethos. People who have come before us, people who will come along the way, who do very, very similar style of work as us, this kind of open work… And I think that’s got everything to do with the fact that this is what the people want. We’re just the everyman, just like everybody else. We’re not like billionaires, or super all ex Facebook, or anything like that. We’re just a bunch of people who really, really care about this, who want to see everyone have access to language models, everyone be able to automate their lives, everyone be able to push their understanding of any topic to the next level. And our work, as we become an organization that’s looking to be a company, and create revenue etc. we won’t let it tamper or hinder any of the open source work we do. In fact, we want it to empower all of that work, because we believe that the tools and the developments and services that we will be providing as a corporation will only serve to better feed the entire open source community. We’re not really looking to suddenly make like a closed Hermes, or something like that. We’re more looking to create tools, and do research that makes your open Hermes far more effective, far better, and good enough that you may want to pay for that tool. [laughs]",

Bigham, Jeffrey Nichols\n\nAbstract.\n\nUser interface (UI) design is a difficult yet important task for ensuring the usability, accessibility, and aesthetic qualities of applications. In our paper, we develop a machine-learned model, UIClip, for assessing the design quality and visual relevance of a UI given its screenshot and natural language description. To train UIClip, we used a combination of automated crawling, synthetic augmentation, and human ratings to construct a large-scale dataset of UIs, collated by description and ranked by design quality. Through training on the dataset, UIClip implicitly learns properties of good and bad designs by i) assigning a numerical score that represents a UI design’s relevance and quality and ii) providing design suggestions. In an evaluation that compared the outputs of UIClip and other baselines to UIs rated by 12 human designers, we found that UIClip achieved the highest agreement with ground-truth rankings. Finally, we present three example applications that demonstrate how UIClip can facilitate downstream applications that rely on instantaneous assessment of UI design quality: i) UI code generation, ii) UI design tips generation, and iii) quality-aware UI example search.\n\nUI Modeling; UI Design Assessment; Dataset\n\n††copyright: acmlicensed††journalyear: 2018††doi: XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX††conference: Make sure to enter the correct conference title from your rights confirmation emai; June 03–05, 2018; Woodstock, NY††isbn: 978-1-4503-XXXX-X/18/06\n\n1. Introduction\n\nWhat makes a good user interface (UI)? It is hard to comprehensively articulate what separates a good UI design from a bad one, and the task of UI design is challenging even for experts with years of training and practice. Guidelines exist that list some general principles (Nielsen, 1992; Shneiderman et al., 2016), but they are often insufficient or difficult to operationalize, especially for novice designers. Because of this, many application UIs today contain common design problems, which can negatively impact usability, accessibility, and design aesthetics.\n\nThe most holistic method of evaluating UIs is usability testing, which can uncover UI design flaws, accessibility problems, and software bugs, but it is generally a time-consuming and costly process. Approximate assessments, such as heuristic evaluation, rely on experts applying a set of pre-defined principles to rapidly identify potential problems and estimate overall UI quality. However, even these abbreviated strategies can be difficult to employ consistently or in the absence of a knowledgeable expert.\n\nTo this end, computational methods have been developed to estimate the quality of UIs, taking into account factors such as visual aesthetics (Miniukovich and De Angeli, 2015), cognitive principles (Oulasvirta et al., 2018), and context (Oulasvirta et al., 2022). Because of their automated nature, they unlock new opportunities for UI design (Swearngin et al., 2020; Todi et al., 2016) and evaluation (Moran et al., 2018). However, most of these prior computational approaches are limited. Some techniques apply objectives and metrics inspired by cognitive principles (Miniukovich and De Angeli, 2015; Oulasvirta et al., 2018), such as visual complexity, layout quality, and color harmony to UI designs, but their outputs still require interpretation and cannot, for example, be used to compare the quality of two candidate designs. Other approaches are toolkits that learn user-specific models for generating adaptive interfaces (Gajos and Weld, 2004, 2005; Gajos et al., 2007), and they also cannot be applied to more generalized UI design tasks.\n\nOur paper introduces a novel computational model, UIClip, to assess the design quality of any UI from its screenshot. UIClip is based on the well-known CLIP vision-language model (Radford et al., 2021), and it uses a natural language description of the UI coupled with a screenshot to assign a numerical score that estimates design quality. CLIP, by default, is not well-suited for judging UI quality and relevance. Therefore, to train UIClip, we developed a novel technique for synthetically generating a large-scale dataset of UIs ranked by design quality. Our strategy takes existing UIs (e.g., web pages) and intentionally introduces design defects by modifying style and layout attributes. The process created pairs of original and “jittered” interfaces and allowed the models to learn the differentiation between these pairs. We used this method to generate 2.3 million pairs of UIs coupled with their quality-related descriptions. To align our model with real-world design preferences, we collected 1.2K ratings from professional designers on an extra UI set. These ratings were used to refine UIClip and validate the effectiveness of our model.\n\nWe benchmarked UIClip with other large vision-language models (LVLM) by evaluating them on a held-out set of UI screens. We assess the models on three tasks, including design quality, improvement suggestions, and design relevance. The results showed that UIClip outperformed all other models in every task, despite being smaller in size. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of UIClip, we present three example applications that use our model to provide different types of computational UI design assistance: i) quality-aware UI code generation, ii) UI design suggestion generation, and iii) quality-aware UI example retrieval.\n\nTo summarize, our work makes the following contributions:\n\n(1)\n\nA large-scale dataset of UI designs and descriptions comprised of synthetic and human-generated design ratings.\n\n(2)\n\nA computational model that scores UI screenshots based on relevance to a textual description and design quality.\n\n(3)\n\nThree example applications that demonstrate how UIClip can be used to facilitate downstream applications: i) a tool that improves the quality of UI code generated by LLMs, ii) a tool that generates design recommendations for a UI screenshot, and iii) a UI design search engine.\n\nTo facilitate research in this area, we plan to release all the training code, data, and models.\n\n2. Related Work\n\nOur research builds upon existing work in UI design and evaluation by encoding UI design quality into computational models, enabling the models to serve as potential tools for UI design assessment. We review the literature in three relevant areas: UI design tools, UI evaluation, and machine learning-based quality metrics.\n\n2.1. UI Design Tools\n\nEmbedding computational capabilities into UI design tools enables machines to computationally assess the design thus empowering designers to ideate, prototype, and iterate their work effectively. Early research like SILK (Landay, 1996) and DENIM (Newman et al., 2003) introduced quick sketching capabilities, making the design process more agile. Damask (Lin and Landay, 2002) refined the creation process with its emphasis on pattern-based design, enhancing UI component reusability. The evolution continued with Smart Templates (Nichols et al., 2004), which provided designers with adaptable frameworks that intelligently adjusted to their needs, simplifying the design process. Sikuli (Yeh et al., 2009) built upon the thread of intelligent design tools by integrating image-based search functionalities, making it easier for designers to find and incorporate UI elements. As the field progressed, tools like Sketchplore (Todi et al., 2016) and Scout (Swearngin et al., 2020) enabled designers to explore a wider array of design alternatives, encouraging creativity. D.note (Hartmann et al., 2010) and Swire (Huang et al., 2019) introduced interactive elements that incorporated user feedback directly into the design, enhancing user-centric approaches. The integration of deep learning into UI design tools marked a pivotal shift, starting with the use of datasets like RICO (Deka et al., 2017) to inform model training. For instance, GUIComp (Lee et al., 2020) is a tool that includes an autoencoder trained on the large-scale UI dataset to help find UI design examples for inspiration. In addition, the tool employed convolutional neural networks to evaluate the visual complexity of UI prototypes and pinpoint the main areas of interest. Similarly, VINS (Bunian et al., 2021) introduced a visual search framework powered by models trained on a more diverse annotated UI dataset, enabling designers to find similar visual UI designs across platforms. Our work builds upon existing work in computational UI design tools by building neural models to quantify UI design quality through language, and integrate the models into various UI design applications.\n\n2.2. UI Evaluation\n\nTraditional UI evaluation, initially rooted in heuristic evaluation and established guidelines (Nielsen, 1994; Jansen, 1998), has evolved significantly over time. The development of automated metrics marked a transition towards more objective and scalable UI assessments. Early work like ARNAULD (Gajos and Weld, 2005) collected user preferences about specific outcomes to automatically learn and tailor a cost function for UI assessment and adaptation. tLight (Miniukovich and De Angeli, 2015) continued this vision and presented eight automatic metrics for evaluating graphical user interfaces’ aesthetics, demonstrating their effectiveness on desktop and mobile platforms. Progressing further, researchers also explored assessing the visual complexity of mobile user interfaces, establishing metrics that link visual complexity to perceived usability (Riegler and Holzmann, 2018). This shift underscores a growing emphasis on quantifying user interface elements to predict usability outcomes. Moreover, integrating cognitive principles into UI evaluation is gaining traction, with metrics now considering harmony and attractiveness, aligning with how users perceive and organize visual information. For instance, the Aalto Interface Metrics (AIM) service (Oulasvirta et al., 2018) demonstrates how blending user perception and attention models can improve GUI design evaluation. In recent developments, deep learning has been employed to model user interaction aspects like tappability (Swearngin and Li, 2019; Schoop et al., 2022) and draggability (Wu et al., 2023a), marking a shift towards using neural modeling to enhance our understanding of user behaviors. Furthermore, with the rise of generative models, recent research applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide UI design feedback (Duan et al., 2024), illustrating how combining design knowledge parameterized in large pre-trained models with user input can be helpful for designers to improve the visual UI design. Our research builds on these advancements by linking UI design with quality-focused natural language descriptions, leveraging language as a tool for retrieval and feedback in design.\n\n2.3. Machine Learning-based Quality Metrics\n\nLearning scoring functions has been an important topic in many areas of machine learning. In the context of text-generation or machine translation, a popular class of text quality metrics involve the use of “ground truth” responses known as “references.” BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and later variants like ROGUE (Lin, 2004) and Meteor (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) were developed for other applications, such as summarization (Giannakopoulos and Karkaletsis, 2011). However, not all domains have access to human-authored references, leading to the development of ”reference-free” metrics. Perplexity (Jelinek et al., 1977), for instance, is a classic metric used to estimate how likely a piece of text, often generated by a machine, is to come from a human-generated corpus. More recently, direct human evaluations have been utilized to assess model-generated text (Zheng et al., 2024). This type of evaluation system often ask individuals to compare outputs from the same input text to determine which model-generated version they prefer. In the realm of computer vision, numerous metrics have been devised to evaluate the quality of images produced by models, including the inception score (Salimans et al., 2016), the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) (Heusel et al., 2017), and more recently the HyPE scores (Zhou et al., 2019). Finally, there has been a class of evaluation methods aimed at multi-modal applications that concern both text and images. CLIPScore (Hessel et al., 2021) is a technique for assessing the quality of image captions by using the pre-trained OpenAI CLIP model. CLIP-IQA (Wang et al., 2023) further adopts CLIP to contrastively learn a function that evaluates images based on various quality attributes (e.g., brightness, colorfulness) and perceptual aspects (happy, scary). TIFA (Hu et al., 2023) introduces a method where it asks and answers its own visual questions using large vision-language models. It then quantifies how well the text prompts and the images generated from those prompts align. In our paper, we show that off-the-shelf vision-language models like CLIP often fall short in accurately analyzing UI screenshots, particularly when assessing UI design quality through language. To tackle this problem, we introduce a comprehensive UI design quality dataset that integrates both machine and human feedback. The collected data enables researchers to build and iterate their computational models using this quality-encoded dataset.\n\n3. Datasets for UI Design Quality\n\nWhile several UI datasets exist, they are annotated for other applications, such as element detection (Deka et al., 2017; Bunian et al., 2021), natural language description (Wang et al., 2021), and app categorization (Leiva et al., 2020). Although some prior work has rated model-generated UI code (Si et al., 2024; Gajos and Weld, 2005), to our knowledge, no publicly available, large-scale dataset exists for UI design assessment. To this end, we collected over 2.3 million UI screenshots, each paired with natural language text that includes a caption, design quality, and design defects. Since it is prohibitively costly and time-consuming to collect enough human-annotated data to train deep learning models, the majority of our data (over 99.9%) is synthetically generated, and a small set of human ratings is collected from designers. We refer to our synthetically-generated dataset as JitterWeb and our human-rated dataset as BetterApp.\n\n3.1. Synthetic Data\n\nJitterWeb is a synthetic dataset of 2.3 million examples created through automated web crawling, data augmentation, and captioning. Recent research has shown that UIs on the web (e.g., web pages), are a useful source of data for data-driven UI modeling, due to the relative ease of applying automated crawling techniques and extracting semantic metadata from the browser (Wu et al., 2023b; Kumar et al., 2013). The main idea behind our synthetic data approach was to first visit an existing web page and record its appearance (i.e., take a screenshot), then randomly apply several jitter functions that intentionally degrade the design quality of the web page in different, controllable ways and record the resulting appearances. Jitter functions are implemented as snippets of JavaScript code that, for example, add random noise to CSS attributes or swap colors in the web page’s color palette. The result of applying this process to a web page is one “original” sample paired with several variations of itself, each with a set of known design defects. Through this process, we are able to construct a large-scale dataset to learn the relative design quality of UIs. In other words, we assume that the original UI is mostly better than the jittered one. Instances where the jittered version outperforms the original are uncommon and the noises introduced from such instances should be negligible given the scale of our dataset.\n\n3.1.1. Data Collection\n\nWe followed the collection methodology of WebUI (Wu et al., 2023b), where a headless Chrome browser was used to visit thousands of websites with different simulated client devices (e.g., mobile phone, desktop, tablet). It was not possible to directly re-use the publicly-released WebUI data, which consists of screenshots and extracted metadata, because our data augmentation pipeline necessitates loading the website in a browser to run the jitter functions, which are implemented as JavaScript code. Unlike the crawler used in WebUI, we adopted a simpler architecture that directly crawls URLs from publicly available datasets. We crawled nearly 300,000 web pages, using URLs from the MC4 dataset provided by the Allen Institute for AI (Dodge et al., 2021), which is an adaptation of the original C4 dataset (Raffel et al., 2020) frequently used to train large language models (Le Scao et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Biderman et al., 2023). This dataset has undergone screening to remove explicit content (Dodge et al., 2021). In addition, we excluded URLs that resulted in 404 errors.\n\nJitterWeb was randomly partitioned into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) splits by web page URL. We further randomly selected 201 samples from the original test split, to make it the same size as the test split from our human-rated data (BetterApp) for model evaluation.\n\n3.1.2. Jitter Functions\n\nJitter functions are JavaScript code snippets that are used to controllably introduce design defects into web pages. To design these functions, we reviewed various guidelines on usability and design evaluation found in design textbooks (Shneiderman et al., 2016; Lidwell et al., 2010), online resources (Wong, 2024; Gordon, 2020), and published literature (Luther et al., 2015). While undoubtedly useful for informing application design, many of the principles described in these resources could not be assessed by looking at a single screenshot (e.g., “error prevention,” “user control and freedom”). We ultimately chose the CRAP guidelines (Williams, 2015), which are four general principles for UI visual design relevant to our task: contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. We developed the jitter functions based on a combination of these guidelines and what is possible to programmatically adjust through JavaScript and CSS styling.\n\nBelow, we describe the functions that we implemented and the CRAP principles that inspired them:\n\n•\n\nColors\n\n–\n\nColor Swap (contrast, repetition) - Randomly swaps the colors of elements on the web page\n\n–\n\nColor Noise (contrast, repetition) - Adds numerical noise to CSS attributes for RGB values\n\n•\n\nFont\n\n–\n\nFont Size (contrast, repetition) - Randomly swaps the font sizes of text elements in the page (e.g., swapping the size of subheading text with the size of body text)\n\n–\n\nText Noise (contrast, repetition) - Adds numerical noise to CSS attributes for text size\n\n•\n\nContrast\n\n–\n\nText Color (contrast) - The contrast of text is decreased so that it appears closer to its container’s color\n\n–\n\nBackground Color (contrast) - Makes the background color of containers containing text closer to the color of the text.\n\n•\n\nSpacing (alignment, proximity) - Adds numerical noise to CSS attributes for margin and padding\n\n•\n\nComplexity (contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity) - Randomly removes images, text, and other element styling\n\n•\n\nLayout (alignment, proximity) - Modifies CSS related to element layout such as flow (e.g., horizontal or vertical).\n\nThe jitter functions are composable, and when the crawler visits a web page, it chooses up to three functions via uniform random sampling to apply sequentially before taking a screenshot of the jittered UI. Figure 1 shows an example of a web page processed by each of our jitter functions.\n\n3.1.3. Description Generation\n\nEach UI screenshot was associated with a natural language description that includes a caption, design quality, and a list of design defects (inferred from the applied jitter functions). The full description is formatted by concatenating multiple components: i) a constant prefix (“ui screenshot.”), ii) a design quality tag (“poor design” if the screen has been jittered, otherwise “well-designed”), iii) a list of design defects (e.g., if the “text contrast” jitter function was applied, a suggestion would be “bad text contrast”), and iv) a caption describing the screenshot. Figure 2 provides a visual illustration of this process.\n\nThe design-related components are inferred from the jittering process. To generate the caption, we used a set of pre-trained models to predict (Lee et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2021), then paraphrase (Jiang et al., 2023) a caption from the UI screenshot. In the generation process, we specifically avoided the use of models with restrictive usage agreements or trained using data from models with restrictive usage agreements . Because the introduction of design defects by jitter functions may affect the accuracy of the captioning model, we generate the caption for each original UI, and then propagate the caption to all its variations.\n\n3.2. Human-rated Data\n\nWhile our synthetic approach to automatically generating pairs of design preferences can be efficiently scaled to millions of screenshots, it also has drawbacks. In the synthetic dataset, preferences are only generated between variations of the same screen, which does not reflect comparison between independent designs. While we used established design principles to author jitter functions, they may not represent the actual distribution of design flaws across real-world apps, e.g., small element margins may be a very common problem “in-the-wild” but is only represented in one of our heuristics. Finally, a part of the creation process for the synthetic dataset involves using a pre-trained UI screenshot captioning model for caption generation. This model may produce incorrect captions that limit a downstream model’s ability to understand UI design relevance. To this end, we collected the BetterApp dataset using feedback from human designers. BetterApp addresses the drawbacks of synthetic data by i) comparing UI screens from different apps, ii) collecting design defects from real apps, and iii) using human-improved UI captions.\n\nAs a starting point, we used an existing public dataset called VINS (Bunian et al., 2021), which contains screenshots of iOS apps, Android apps, design mockups, and lower-fidelity design artifacts such as wireframes. Because it was originally used for design search and element detection applications, the VINS dataset contains screenshot images and element annotations. For our application, we only use the screenshot images and not the lower-fidelity wireframes. In addition to VINS data, we also included screenshots of UIs rendered by an open large-language model (Jiang et al., 2024) prompted to generate HTML code given natural language descriptions in our dataset. We hypothesized that these samples would contain more variation in design quality and more design defects, which could be useful for learning design quality.\n\nTo prepare the data for our rating procedure, we applied several additional processing steps. We first applied the same automated captioning model (Lee et al., 2023) used to construct synthetic examples to assign an initial caption to each dataset in VINS. These captions were later improved by participants. We used a pre-trained sentence embedding model (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) to generate a fixed-size embedding for each screen based on its auto-generated caption. Finally, we applied the DBSCAN clustering algorithm (Ester et al., 1996) to group together screenshots with similar captions. As a result of this process, the screenshots are collated so that screens of similar functionality can be found in the same cluster (e.g., all login screens). We clustered the VINS and synthetic examples separately, so clusters are only made entirely of either real-world or synthetic UIs. Designers were then asked through pairwise comparisons to assign relative rankings between UI screens in the same cluster.\n\n3.2.1. Designer Rating Procedure\n\nWe recruited 12 designers (ages 20-32, 11 female and 1 male) as participants at a university with varying levels of experience through word of mouth. The participants had varying backgrounds. Some had up to 8 years of industry experience in UI/UX design. Others had more informal experience, but all were enrolled or had taken graduate-level courses focused on the design and implementation of UIs. Participants spent around 1.5 hours rating UI screenshots, with the goal of reaching at least 100 screenshots. Participants were compensated $10 per hour (rounded up) for their time.\n\nParticipants were first asked to review an online resource that describes and provides examples of the CRAP visual design principles (Kimball, 2013). Participant ratings were collected using a custom-built web application (Figure 3). The start page of the application displayed instructions and recorded a visitor ID, which allowed analysis of rating consistency.\n\nFollowing the start page, the web application repeatedly i) selects a random cluster from the processed data then ii) randomly selects two UIs from within the cluster to display. The participant was then asked to do the following steps:\n\n(1)\n\nWrite a short, one-sentence caption that contains enough detail to describe both screenshots. If one of the screenshots is irrelevant (e.g., due to clustering error), write a caption for the first screenshot.\n\n(2)\n\nProvide a relative ranking between the two screenshots given the options “A is better” or “B is better.”\n\n(3)\n\nSelect all relevant CRAP principles that were important in determining the ranking, unless “about the same” was selected in the prior step.\n\nIn total, we collected around 1200 ratings from all participants. We ignored pairs that could not be described by a single caption, which led to 892 rating pairs. To measure inter-rater reliability (IRR), we initially had each participant evaluate the same set of 10 predetermined pairs. Afterward, the rating pairs were distributed randomly. We used this initial set to compute Krippendorff’s alpha score, with α=0.37𝛼0.37\\alpha=0.37italic_α = 0.37. We discuss the factors influencing these ratings in Section 7.2, attributing the variation to the task’s inherent subjectivity and variable individual preferences, such as familiarity with Android or iOS apps.\n\nSimilar to our synthetic generation approach, responses from each step are used to construct different parts of each UI screenshot’s text description. The human-authored or human-refined caption from step 1 is used to improve the original auto-generated one. The relative ranking from step 2 is used to infer the correct design-quality tag, where the preferred example is assigned “well-designed” and the other is assigned “poor design.” If it was indicated that the two screenshots had the same quality, the design quality tag was omitted from the full description. The selected principles from step 3 are used to construct a set of design defects for the non-preferred screenshot. For example, if a participant selected the contrast principle as a reason for choosing A over B, then “bad contrast” is added to the generated description of B. Note that the same screenshot can appear in more than one randomly sampled pair, which could result in conflicting descriptions e.g., if it was preferred in one round but not in another. Our training algorithm is robust to these collisions and over time learns to approximate a score based on the proportion of times it was preferred.\n\nTo generate BetterApp training (70%), validation (10%), and test (20%) splits, we randomly partitioned the UI clusters, which ensured that both UI screenshots from rated pairs always occurred within the same split. We chose the split percentages for BetterApp so that the size of the test set is roughly equivalent in size to other popular model benchmarks (Chen et al., 2021). The final sizes of the splits were: train (618 pairs), validation (73 pairs), and test (201 pairs).\n\n4. UIClip\n\nWe used the JitterWeb and BetterApp datasets to train a computational model UIClip, that assesses UI designs from screenshots. While our datasets could be applied to train any model, such as large vision-language models (Liu et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023) that typically include the language decoder from an LLM, we adopted the CLIP architecture (Radford et al., 2021) as it is designed to produce a numerical score, which is similar to our objective of scoring designs. In addition, we also found this model to be more versatile for supporting a set of example applications (e.g., example retrieval and scoring) and much more efficient for training and inferencing (due to much smaller size). There are several variations of the CLIP model, and we chose the smallest variation released by OpenAI called CLIP B/32, which contains 151 million parameters.\n\nCLIP B/32 is a dual-encoder transformer model (i.e., consisting of an image and text encoder) that accepts i) a textual description and ii) an image as inputs, then encodes both into a shared embedding space. The image encoder is a vision transformer that accepts a fixed-size 224x224 image as input, splits it up into 32x32 pixel patches, and then encodes the patches into a 512-dimensional embedding. The text encoder is a transformer that accepts text sequences of up to 77 tokens (each token roughly corresponds to a word) and also produces a 512-dimensional embedding. The outputs of these two encoders are often used to produce a single numerical value, which is computed as the dot product of the image and text embeddings. CLIP’s dot product output can be interpreted in many ways, with a common one being the semantic similarity of the two inputs e.g., the text “a dog” and an image of a dog would produce a high score. CLIP was trained on roughly 400 million pairs of images and text captions scraped from the internet, which it used to learn these semantic associations. While CLIP is often successful in general image classification or association tasks, these internet crawls often lack data for more domain-specific tasks such as understanding images taken by satellites, autonomous vehicles, and medical images (Radford et al., 2021). As we show in our baseline evaluation, CLIP also performs poorly on UI screenshots, which are relatively rare in the model’s original training data.\n\nThe purpose of our training procedure is to finetune the CLIP B/32 to i) improve relevance scoring among UI screenshots and descriptions and ii) incorporate design quality as a factor in the score, and iii) associate descriptions of design defects with screenshots of UIs that contain them. We refer to our model as UIClip, since it is a descendant of CLIP that is optimized for UIs.\n\n4.1. Training\n\nWe trained UIClip in four stages that incorporated different data sources and training objectives, which were designed for different use cases and tasks. In the first training stage, which we refer to as “pre-training,” we trained UIClip using the JitterWeb dataset and the same training objective used in the original CLIP implementation (Radford et al., 2021). We found this useful for applications related to retrieval and associating UI screenshots with relevant descriptions. In the second stage, we switched UIClip’s training objective to an alternative loss function that specifically focuses on distinguishing good from bad UI designs. These two stages are then repeated for the BetterApp dataset, where each stage uses model weights from the previous stage as a starting point. During all stages of training, we adopt a pre-processing methodology similar to the one used in the original CLIP paper (Radford et al., 2021) and subsequent reproductions (Cherti et al., 2023), where a random-crop strategy is used to capture different parts of UI screenshots.\n\n4.1.1. CLIP Pretraining Objective\n\nDuring the pre-training stage, we used the same training objective as the base CLIP model (Radford et al., 2021), which is described by Equation 1.\n\n(1) ℒC⁢L⁢I⁢P=−∑iln⁡evi⋅wi∑jevi⋅wj−∑jln⁡evj⋅wj∑ievi⋅wjsubscriptℒ𝐶𝐿𝐼𝑃subscript𝑖superscript𝑒⋅subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑤𝑖subscript𝑗superscript𝑒⋅subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝑗superscript𝑒⋅subscript𝑣𝑗subscript𝑤𝑗subscript𝑖superscript𝑒⋅subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑤𝑗\\mathcal{L}_{CLIP}={\\displaystyle-\\sum_{i}\\ln{\\frac{e^{v_{i}\\cdot w_{i}}}{\\sum% _{j}e^{v_{i}\\cdot w_{j}}}}-\\sum_{j}\\ln{\\frac{e^{v_{j}\\cdot w_{j}}}{\\sum_{i}e^{% v_{i}\\cdot w_{j}}}}}caligraphic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_C italic_L italic_I italic_P end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = - ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_ln divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⋅ italic_w start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⋅ italic_w start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG - ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_ln divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⋅ italic_w start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ⋅ italic_w start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG\n\nWhere, wisubscript𝑤𝑖w_{i}italic_w start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT refers to the i𝑖iitalic_i-th text embedding in the batch and vjsubscript𝑣𝑗v_{j}italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT refers to the j𝑗jitalic_j-th image embedding in the batch.\n\nTo give a high-level overview of the process, this training objective involves repeatedly sampling a minibatch of N𝑁Nitalic_N examples from the training dataset, where each example consists of an image (UI screenshot) and a textual description (caption with a design quality tag and applied jitters). The model generates embeddings for all text w1⁢…⁢Nsubscript𝑤1…𝑁w_{1...N}italic_w start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 … italic_N end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and images v1⁢…⁢Nsubscript𝑣1…𝑁v_{1...N}italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 … italic_N end_POSTSUBSCRIPT in the minibatch, then computes an N⁢x⁢N𝑁𝑥𝑁NxNitalic_N italic_x italic_N similarity matrix between all combinations of images and text. The objective then computes the cross entropy loss to match each image with its original text description, and vice versa. The intuition behind this process is that the representations of corresponding images and text will gradually become more similar in the shared embedding space, while mismatched pairs will be pushed apart. In the case of UIClip, screenshots will be matched to textual descriptions containing the appropriate design quality tag, design suggestions, and caption.\n\n4.1.2. Pairwise Contrastive Objective\n\nA drawback of the standard CLIP objective is that the minibatches used to compute its loss are randomly sampled from the entire training dataset. Because the size of a minibatch is much smaller than the size of the entire training dataset, there is very low chance that a minibatch will contain examples of closely-related UI screenshots e.g., both a jittered and non-jittered version of a webpage. We hypothesized that this would make it more difficult for the model to learn relationships between these related UIs, which is necessary for assessing the relative quality of related designs. Therefore, we modified the training objective to explicitly compare pairs of related UI screens. Our method is similar to previous methods for pairwise contrastive learning (Hadsell et al., 2006), but we use a cross-entropy loss, which is more compatible with the pre-training objective, instead of the margin-based one.\n\nThis training objective, shown in Equation 2, trains the model so that the embedding of the preferred screenshot has a higher dot product with a text description indicating good design (i.e., a design quality tag of “well-designed”) than the embedding of the non-preferred screenshot.\n\n(2) ℒp⁢a⁢i⁢r=−ln⁡ev+⋅w+ev+⋅w++ev−⋅w+subscriptℒ𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟superscript𝑒⋅superscript𝑣superscript𝑤superscript𝑒⋅superscript𝑣superscript𝑤superscript𝑒⋅superscript𝑣superscript𝑤\\mathcal{L}_{pair}={\\displaystyle-\\ln{\\frac{e^{v^{+}\\cdot w^{+}}}{e^{v^{+}% \\cdot w^{+}}+e^{v^{-}\\cdot w^{+}}}}}caligraphic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p italic_a italic_i italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = - roman_ln divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_v start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ⋅ italic_w start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_v start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ⋅ italic_w start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_v start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ⋅ italic_w start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG\n\nWhere v+superscript𝑣v^{+}italic_v start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT refers to the embedding of the preferred screenshot, v−superscript𝑣v^{-}italic_v start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT is the embedding of the non-preferred screenshot, and w+superscript𝑤w^{+}italic_w start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT is the embedding of the text description.\n\n4.2. Inference\n\n4.2.1. Preprocessing\n\nCLIP has a fixed image input size of 224x224 pixels, which presents challenges for encoding UI screenshots during inference given that many mobile apps are designed with high height-to-width aspect ratios and dimensions can vary significantly between UIs captured on different devices. Naive pre-processing methods such as image scaling or image cropping can result in significant distortion or exclude important information. One way to address this is to make architectural changes to the model, using similar strategies to previous work (Lee et al., 2023). We adopt a simpler strategy to handle variable image sizes using a sliding window strategy. The input screenshot is first resized so that its smaller dimension is equal to 224 pixels. A 224x224 window slides across the larger dimension of size d𝑑ditalic_d where the number of evenly-spaced steps is equal to ⌊d224⌋+1𝑑2241\\lfloor\\frac{d}{224}\\rfloor+1⌊ divide start_ARG italic_d end_ARG start_ARG 224 end_ARG ⌋ + 1, so that the entire image is covered with the minimal amount of overlapped area. The image encoder is used to compute an embedding for each window of the screenshot, and then all embeddings are averaged together.\n\n4.2.2. UIClip Score\n\nThe UIClip score represents a combination of the relevance of the text description and the UI screenshot and the design quality of the UI screenshot. Computing the UIClip score requires i) a screenshot of the UI to be evaluated and ii) a user-provided caption describing the intended purpose of the UI. A full textual description is constructed by pre-pending a prefix “ui screenshot. well-designed. ” to the user-provided caption. The resulting score between the encoded screenshot and the encoded full description represents a score that describes how well the screenshot adheres to a “well-designed” UI with the target caption.\n\n4.2.3. Design Suggestions\n\nDuring training, UIClip learns to associate screenshots with with natural language descriptions containing design defects that are potentially contained within them. However, because UIClip doesn’t contain a decoder network, it cannot directly generate text like other auto-regressive transformers (Radford et al., 2018).\n\nInstead, we develop an alternative approach that uses UIClip to detect possible design defects in an input screenshot, then surfaces them as warnings to the user to fix. For each possible defect, a natural language description is constructed by pre-pending the corresponding prefix to the caption, e.g., “ui screenshot. poor design. bad text sizing. login screen.” We consider all design defects introduced by our jitter function (e.g., “bad text sizing”) and the four CRAP principles (e.g., “bad alignment”). We computed the similarity score between the input image and these text descriptions that corresponded to design defects. To determine the design defects that are surfaced, we dynamically compute a threshold. The threshold is computed as the image’s similarity score with a caption without any defect tags, e.g., “ui screenshot. poor design. login screen.” Design suggestions can also be limited to a smaller number of categories (e.g., only the four CRAP principles) through pre-defined mappings. For example, since the color noise jitter could affect both contrast and repetition, we map “bad color choice” to warnings for these classes.\n\n5. Evaluation\n\nThe purpose of our evaluation is to quantify multiple aspects of UIClip’s design assessment capabilities and to compare its performance against several state-of-the-art baseline models and ablation conditions. We focus on tasks that correspond to three use-cases: i) design quality assessment, ii) design suggestion generation, and iii) design relevance. In all three tasks, UIClip outperforms baseline models that are often several orders of magnitude larger.\n\n5.1. Procedure\n\nWe conducted a quantitative evaluation that measured model performance using held-out examples from our datasets.\n\n5.1.1. Baselines\n\nWe chose several baselines that consist of different types of multimodal machine-learning models. Originally, we planned to include AIM (Oulasvirta et al., 2018), which is a software package for computing various metrics for UIs. However, there is no definitive way to convert these metrics into design ratings, so we excluded it as a baseline. Therefore, we limit our analysis to the machine-learned models described below.\n\n•\n\nProprietary Large Vision-Language Models (only accessible via APIs)\n\n–\n\nOpenAI GPT-4V - GPT-4V is a model developed by OpenAI that has been shown to excel at a variety of tasks (Achiam et al., 2023).\n\n–\n\nAnthropic Claude-3-Opus - Claude-3-Opus is a model that was introduced by Anthropic at March 2024. It is the largest and most powerful variant among the three Claude-3 models (Anthropic, 2023).\n\n–\n\nGoogle Gemini-1.0-Pro - Google Gemini-1.0-Pro (Vision) is a model that was introduced by Google in December 2023 (Team et al., 2023). It’s the most powerful publicly available model among the three Gemini-1.0 models (Gemini-1.0-Ultra was announced but not publicly available at the time we performed this benchmarking).\n\n•\n\nOpen-source Large Vision-Language Models (model weights are publicly available)\n\n–\n\nLLaVA-1.6-13B - LLaVA (Liu et al., 2024) is a model that was trained using a combination of training examples generated by proprietary large language and vision-language models as well as publicly available visual reasoning and image caption datasets. We used the 13B model (with ViT-L/14 (Zhai et al., 2022) as the vision encoder and Vicuna-13B (Chiang et al., 2023) as the language decoder) as one of our baselines, which is the largest model that we could fit on our GPU hardware.\n\n–\n\nQwen-VL-Chat-7B - Qwen-VL-Chat (Bai et al., 2023) is similar to LLaVA, but it was trained using an alternative pre-training objective and datasets. This model (with ViT-bigG (Gadre et al., 2024) as the vision encoder and Qwen-7B (Bai et al., 2023) as the language decoder) is notable because its pre-training data contained images of documents, which we hypothesized could be relevant for understanding UIs as well.\n\n•\n\nCLIP Models\n\n–\n\nCLIP B/32 - We used the unmodified CLIP B/32 model, which was trained by OpenAI on 400M image-text pairs known as the WebImageText dataset.\n\n–\n\nMetaCLIP H/12 - Recent research has focused on improving the performance of CLIP models by scaling model size (Cherti et al., 2023) and curating larger and higher-quality multi-modal training datasets (Gadre et al., 2024). MetaCLIP H/12 is a recent model to achieve state-of-the-art performance for CLIP-like models. It is roughly 6 times larger than CLIP B/32 and was trained on roughly 6 times more data (Xu et al., 2023).\n\n•\n\nCLIP Models with Alternative Data\n\n–\n\nCLIP B/32 + Screen2Words - We trained CLIP B/32 on the largest (to our knowledge) publicly-released dataset of UI screenshots paired with human-authored natural language captions using the default CLIP training objective.\n\n–\n\nCLIP B/32 + non-jittered websites - We trained CLIP B/32 on only non-jittered websites from JitterWeb using the default CLIP training objective.\n\n•\n\nUIClip\n\n–\n\nCLIP B/32 + jittered websites - We trained CLIP B/32 on all data from JitterWeb using the default CLIP training objective.\n\n–\n\nCLIP B/32 + jittered websites + web pairs - We trained CLIP B/32 on all data from JitterWeb using both the default CLIP objective and the paired contrastive objective.\n\n–\n\nCLIP B/32 + jittered websites + web pairs + human pairs - This model consists of CLIP B/32 trained on JitterWeb and BetterApp using both the default CLIP objective and the paired contrastive objective.\n\n5.1.2. Model Inference\n\nLVLM models rely on a natural-language prompt to instruct them on how to process the image input. We constructed a prompt that asked the model to use the CRAP principles to choose the better design of two UI screenshots and provide the most relevant CRAP principles for its decision. We provided the model with the same short description of the CRAP principles we gave our designers who rated the BetterApp dataset. Since some models could only accept one image input, we concatenated two UI screenshots side by side into a single image. In preliminary tests, we verified that all models could distinguish the inputs by asking them to describe the left and right screenshots of the input image.\n\nWe iterated through several versions of prompts which included well-known strategies for eliciting step-by-step reasoning (Kojima et al., 2022). We chose the best natural language prompt from our tests and used it for all models. The format of the prompt is provided in the appendix (We also included an example of GPT-4V’s output when accessed through the web interface in Figure 6, with a slightly modified prompt that allowed it to provide additional reasoning). We used the default parameters (e.g., temperature and top-p) for all the LVLMs we compared. UIClip and other CLIP-based models used the inference strategies described in Section 4.2.\n\n5.2. Results\n\nWe focused on evaluating three aspects of design assessment: i) UI design quality assessment, ii) design suggestion generation, and iii) design relevance.\n\n5.2.1. Design Quality\n\nWe evaluated a model’s design quality assessment by measuring its accuracy in identifying the “preferred” UI from an example pair. The results of our experiments are shown in Figure 4.\n\nIn general, design quality assessment is a difficult task for all tested models, especially when evaluating human-rated pairs of real app screens. Our results are shown in Figure 5. For both BetterApp and JitterWeb, the UIClip variant trained with web pairs performed the best, with an average overall accuracy of 75.12%. In particular, we see large improvements in detecting design defects in web pages (87.1%), which is what the majority of the training process and data focused on.\n\nThese improvements are notable because CLIP B/32, which was the base model of all UIClip variants, performed the worst out of all baselines. CLIP B/32 performed especially poorly for jittered websites, where a further analysis revealed it erroneously associated certain types of jitters (e.g., dark, unreadable backgrounds) with better design. This suggests that our training procedure and data are effective for learning design quality, especially when compared to other publicly available sources of captioned UIs (e.g., Screen2Words) or general-purpose multi-modal data (e.g., MetaCLIP H/12).\n\nIncorporating human ratings appeared to lead to slightly degraded performance (overall accuracy of 73.88%), possibly due to insufficient data. As noted previously, the UIClip with CLIP pre-training objective alone was less effective at improving design quality assessment capabilities because paired UI examples are often not found in randomly sampled minibatches. Nevertheless, it had the third-highest overall accuracy of 65.42%.\n\nDespite their much larger size, all LVLMs performed very poorly on design quality assessment, often around the level of random guessing. Interestingly, GPT-4V (overall 51.58%) refused to provide a response for around 10% of examples, stating “I’m sorry, I can’t help you with that.” In this regard, open models such as LLaVA performed better than GPT-4V, even though LLaVA was trained by distilling GPT-4V output. However, since LLaVA was not trained to refuse requests (Liu et al., 2023), it ended up with a higher overall performance for design choice prediction (with 54.59% prediction accuracy).\n\n5.2.2. Design Suggestions\n\nWe evaluated all models’ design suggestion capabilities by comparing the model-generated output to the CRAP principles selected by designers when rating UI quality in BetterApp. There were four possible CRAP principles that could have been chosen for each comparison, which we formulate as a multi-label classification problem with four labels. Since designers were allowed to omit reasoning for comparisons, we ignored comparisons where none of the CRAP principles were selected.\n\nAgain, design suggestion was a challenging task for all tested models. Some LVLM baselines listed all four CRAP principles for almost every single example, despite being prompted to only choose the most relevant principles. This appears to be consistent with prior work on using LLMs for heuristic evaluation (Duan et al., 2024), where similar models often provided a large number of irrelevant design suggestions.\n\nIn our case, this phenomena led to artificially high recall for models such as Gemini (87.11% recall) and GPT-4V (84.57% recall). Thus, we introduced a choice-adjusted F1 metric that ignored models’ design suggestions if it led to choosing the wrong preferred UI, i.e., right reasoning but wrong answer. This lowered all models’ recall to more realistic levels, e.g., Gemini’s recall was lowered to 49.17% and GPT-4V was lowered to 46.58%. Some open LVLM baselines, such as Qwen-VL-Chat, also had trouble following our prompt and often ignored instructions that asked them to provide reasoning for their answers.\n\nUnder both methods of calculation, UIClip variants had the best performance, with the web pre-trained variant performing the best when all examples were considered and the full UIClip variant performing the best when adjusted for choice accuracy.\n\nCLIP variants that were trained on other sources of data did not achieve high performance, since their training data did not include information about present design defects that would help them make suggestions.\n\n5.2.3. Design Relevance\n\nFinally, we also evaluated a model’s ability to compute UI relevance, which is useful for assessing designs and for various applications that require example retrieval (Bunian et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2019).\n\nTo measure UI relevance, we adopted a metric commonly used in information retrieval known as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). An embedding is computed for the preferred screenshot in BetterApp and JitterWeb. For each description in the evaluation set, we appended the prefix “ui screenshot. well designed. ” and computed its text embedding. The text embedding is used the calculate similarity scores with all screenshots, which is used to sort them in descending order (i.e., highest similarity first). The rank of the first element with the same description was recorded. Since a lower rank is desirable (indicating higher similarity with the corresponding image), MRR (higher is better) is computed as the average of all reciprocal ranks. A higher MRR indicates better retrieval performance. Because there is no straightforward way to generate rankings from LVLMs, we only evaluate models based on the CLIP architecture.\n\nThe results of our retrieval evaluation are shown in Table 1. The variant of UIClip pretrained on JitterWeb using the default CLIP objective achieves the highest MRR score for both BetterApp (0.3851) and JitterWeb (0.4085). UIClip variants trained using pairwise loss were the worst performers, with MRRs lower than the original CLIP B/32 base model, because the objective focuses on the design-comparison task. In our discussion, we provide more detailed reasoning for this phenomenon.\n\nNevertheless, our evaluation still shows that our datasets are useful for learning design relevance, especially when training objectives are closely aligned. For example, applying the CLIP objective to JitterWeb is much more effective than alternate data sources and nearly doubles (0.2000→0.3968→0.20000.39680.2000\\rightarrow 0.39680.2000 → 0.3968) the overall retrieval performance of the base CLIP B/32 model.\n\n6. Example Applications\n\nBased on the three capabilities of UIClip that we evaluated, we present a suite of example applications that illustrate how common user-facing design tools can be enhanced with our model.\n\n6.1. Improving UI Code Generation\n\nWe built a web application that allows users to generate rendered UI screenshots from a natural language description of a UI. To use the interface (Figure 7), users enter their descriptions in a textbox, which is formulated in a prompt. The prompt is fed into an external LLM (OpenAI GPT-3.5), which generates web code (HTML/CSS) using the description. We sampled n=5𝑛5n=5italic_n = 5 different outputs and rendered each into a screenshot using the script that programmatically controlled a browser. If the web code referenced external images, we replaced them with a placeholder image to render. Screenshots were fed into UIClip and were scored against the input prompt. The screenshot of the results ranked in descending score order is returned to the user.\n\nThis is a simple example of how UIClip could be used to improve the output of generative models, most similar to existing “best-of-n sampling” approaches. The method can also be incorporated into the additional vision checkup (Sharma et al., 2024) and used for feedback in self-improving generative model outputs (Madaan et al., 2024). Our technique is simple to implement and does not require access to the underlying model’s weights; however, it is computationally expensive during inference because multiple candidate solutions must be generated. If model weights are available, this process could be further improved by applying UIClip’s filtering during the training process of generative models, or if UIClip was used as a reward model in reinforcement learning fine-tuning approaches (Ouyang et al., 2022; Gulcehre et al., 2023). We leave these investigations to future work.\n\n6.2. UI Design Tips\n\nWe built a tool that allows users to upload screenshots of UI designs to generate design tips using our model’s design suggestion capabilities. We developed a web application (Figure 8) that allows users to upload a screenshot of an app or UI design, and our system generates tips that are surfaced to the user, although a similar idea could be better integrated into, for example, UI design applications for improved ease-of-use. One limitation of our current application is that it might suggest improving text contrast, but it is unable to provide additional information for which part of the UI led to the recommendation. This is due to our problem formulation that pairs descriptions with entire screenshots and doesn’t contain location information. Future improvements can help address this by collecting the relevant data and incorporating that into text descriptions, or by sliding a smaller window across the UI screenshot and associating generated design suggestions to the location of the window. We leave these additional features to future work.\n\n6.3. UI Example Retrieval\n\nUI design search has been explored by many prior works (Kumar et al., 2013; Deka et al., 2017; Bunian et al., 2021), and it has the potential to accelerate the design process by providing relevant examples that designers use to seek inspiration during early phases of the design process. Existing systems built for UI example retrieval have focused on querying and indexing UI screenshots by their layout (e.g., to support finding designs similar to an exemplar) or captions (e.g., to support natural-language or free-form search). Since UIClip contains both an image and text encoder, it is possible to support both of these use cases, although our example application focuses on handling text-based queries. Our application uses a similar procedure to our UI relevance evaluation, where model-computed embeddings are used to retrieve and sort screenshots based on the user’s query. UIClip’s score can take into account both the relevance and quality of retrieved examples, and we incorporate a negative prompt that biases the query vector away from simple or ambiguous designs (Sanchez et al., 2023).\n\nWe built a web application that contains a search box where the user enters their query. Figure 9 shows examples of screens retrieved for a set of queries indexed by UIClip and the vanilla CLIP model.\n\n7. Discussion\n\nOur experiments and example applications show that UIClip’s design assessment capabilities can improve many machine-assisted design tools. In this section, we discuss UIClip’s implications, limitations, and directions for future work.\n\n7.1. Data-driven Learning of UI Design\n\nOur paper introduces techniques for machine-learning a generalized scoring function (c.f. personalized functions (Gajos and Weld, 2005)) that quantifies aspects UI design. We discuss our work’s data and algorithm contributions.\n\nWe hypothesized that a large volume of data (millions of examples) is important for effectively learning to assess designs, similar to how seasoned human designers develop their intuition through years of experience. This hypothesis was largely supported by our experimental results. We showed the substantial benefits of training on our large-scale dataset of UI designs, leading to improvements over alternate datasets (e.g., Screen2Words (Wang et al., 2021)) that more human-authored descriptions but fewer overall samples. When we incorporated our own human-rated BetterApp dataset, we found that in most cases, it did not result in substantial changes, most likely due to insufficient data volume.\n\nAt the same time, dataset size alone is not enough to ensure good design assessment performance. For example, MetaCLIP H/12 was trained on a total of 2.5 billion pairs. Our paper introduces training objectives targeted at different aspects of design quality. We employed two objectives for training UIClip, a batch-wise contrastive objective (i.e., CLIP’s pretraining objective) and a pairwise contrastive objective, designed specifically for quality comparisons. Based on our results, the pairwise objective represents a tradeoff where it achieves higher focus on design-comparison tasks by focusing on pairs of relevant screens but incurs a penalty on retrieval-related tasks, since it is not trained to distinguish irrelevant examples from a diverse minibatch. We leave further investigation of how to optimally combine these two training objectives to future work; although given the relatively small size of our model, we believe it would be feasible to use different variations for application-specific scenarios.\n\n7.2. Formulating UI Design Quality\n\nUIClip’s current model architecture is designed around the assumption that design quality can be represented by a numerical score. However, there are many nuances that cannot be captured by this formulation.\n\nWithin the context of our collected data, we distinguish between assessing UIs for design defects and understanding more subtle design preferences. JitterWeb was constructed by introducing “jitters” into web pages, that intentionally violate design guidelines. In these cases, one might expect to more objectively identify the preferred screen, since the alternative screen would contain a defect. We found this case well captured by our formulation, as shown by our models’ higher performance on the JitterWeb test data. In contrast, examples from BetterApp are more representative of design preferences. Many of its samples were real-world apps, which are often designed professionally and less likely to contain design defects. To verify this, we analyzed design quality performance on the subset of synthetic, LLM-generated screens within BetterApp and compared it with the app screens from VINS. Many of the LLM-generated screens (as shown in Figure 9) contain design defects, which potentially led to easier comparisons. UIClip’s accuracy for rating the quality of synthetic screens (67.65%) was much higher than for real app screens (57.89%). This trend was true for almost all other tested models, where the average of all models’ accuracy on synthetic screens (56.05%) was higher than real apps (51.50%). It is also possible that UIClip is not trained to detect certain types of design defects present in real-world apps, e.g., violations that require the semantic understanding of content, such as information flow hierarchy.\n\nBesides the nature of design defects in real-world apps, design preferences could also vary by person. For example, it is reasonable to expect that someone who frequently uses iOS devices might feel more familiar with iOS screenshots over Android ones. The design language of the same platform can change over time, causing corresponding shifts in user perception, e.g., some screenshots in VINS were from the older Rico dataset (Deka et al., 2017). While UIClip is currently not designed to support more personalized use cases, we envision that it could be finetuned with user-provided preference paired (Gajos and Weld, 2005) or augmented so that it incorporates platform-specific design into its prompt, e.g., “android material design screenshot. well-designed.”\n\n7.3. Supporting UI Design Applications\n\nRelated to our problem formulation is the types of design-assistance tasks that UIClip can support. Despite only producing a numerical score as output, we introduced inference techniques that extend beyond simple UI scoring and allow for a limited generation of natural language design suggestions. We developed three example applications that demonstrate how UIClip could facilitate some forms of automated design assistance. While we did not conduct formal user evaluations of our example applications, we built these applications based on validated systems described in the literature, which suggest they would provide value to users.\n\nHowever, there are many types of design assistance that are not yet supported by UIClip. For example, while UIClip can infer the presence of design defects in a screenshot, there is currently no straightforward method to localize them (e.g., footer bar has poor color contrast). We believe this capability is important for practical use since it provides cues for designers to address the detected flaws. One promising approach, previously applied to other visual design tasks (Schoop et al., 2022), is to augment our current model with model explainability frameworks to understand which parts of the image contribute to predictions. Future iterations of the UIClip could also be trained on sub-windows of a UI for finer-grain inference of fault location, similar to how object detection architectures work. Finally, UIClip could be fine-tuned with more detailed natural language descriptions that associate spatial information with predicted flaws (e.g., “bad color contrast in footer bar”) or even provide suggested fixes (e.g., “bad color contrast. make footer darker”), although this would necessitate a more complex inference algorithm.\n\nRecent trends in machine learning suggest that model architectures that generate free-form text can be more easily scaled and provide more flexible feedback. Our evaluation found that VLMs generally performed poorly, and prior work suggests that LLMs are prone to providing irrelevant design suggestions (Duan et al., 2024). A qualitative assessment of current LLM responses (Figure 6) suggests that current LLMs produce realistic-sounding but inaccurate reasoning. However, we believe that our work could be useful in improving foundation models such as LVLMs. For example, the UIClip model could be used as a “reward model” that guides their UI generation (Section 6.1) and design assessment capabilities. Furthermore, our datasets could be reformatted and used to fine-tune LVLMs for UI-related tasks (Li and Li, 2022).\n\nFinally, most machine learning models, including UIClip and LVLMs are limited in that they can only process a single state of the UI (i.e., a screenshot) when responding to text prompts. Because of this limitation, our current approach focuses on assessing the visual design of a single screen using the CRAP visual design principles. A more holistic evaluation of both UI design and usability depends on a deeper understanding of interface functionality and app navigation flows, which requires both observation and interaction. To support this, we envision that models like UIClip, could be integrated into interactive systems, such as crawlers, that can interact with and explore different parts of an entire app (Wu et al., 2023a; Swearngin et al., 2023).\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a computational model called UIClip that automatically assesses various aspects of UI design: i) design quality, ii) UI relevance, and iii) is capable of generating design suggestions based on predicted defects. Our model is trained from a large-scale dataset of 2.3 million UIs that we collected and augmented with synthetic and human ratings of design quality. In an evaluation with several strong baselines, we demonstrate our model’s performance in UI design understanding in our three target UI tasks, showing that UIClip outperforms all other baselines in all tasks. Finally, we introduce three example applications that demonstrate how UIClip can facilitate novel applications through its automated design assessment capabilities: i) UI code generation, ii) UI design tips generation, and iii) quality-aware UI example search. Overall, our work demonstrates the process of effectively encoding design awareness into the computational models.\n\nReferences\n\n(1)\n\nAchiam et al.

Whether you’re a budding data analyst or a seasoned data scientist, understanding how to build an end-to-end logistic regression model can transform your approach to problem-solving. In this blog, we’ll review everything you need to know about Logistic Regression to get started and build a model in Python. If you’re new to machine learning and have never built a model before, don’t worry; after reading this, I’m confident you’ll be able to do so.\n\nFor those new to this, let’s start with a basic understanding of machine learning before moving on to Logistic Regression in Python.\n\nOverview:\n\nDiscover the basics of machine learning and its types.\n\nUnderstand the core concepts behind logistic regression.\n\nExplore the step-by-step process of implementing a logistic regression model in Python.\n\nThis article was published as a part of the Data Science Blogathon.\n\nWhat is Machine Learning?\n\nIn simple terms, the Machine learning model uses algorithms in which the machine learns from the data just like humans learn from their experiences. Machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed.\n\nTypes of Machine Learning Algorithms\n\nBased on the output type and task done, machine learning models are classified into the following types:\n\nAlso Read: Machine Learning Algorithms\n\nLogistic Regression in Python falls under the Supervised Learning type. Let’s learn more about it.\n\nSupervised Learning\n\nIt’s a type of Machine Learning that uses labelled data from the past. Models are trained using already labelled samples.\n\nExample: You have past data on the Football Premier League, and based on that data and previous match results, you predict which team will win the next game.\n\nSupervised learning is further divided into two types-\n\nRegression: Target/output variable is continuous.\n\nClassification: Target/output variable is categorical.\n\nLogistic Regression is a Classification model that helps make predictions when the output variable is categorical. Let’s understand Logistic Regression in detail.\n\nWhat is Logistic Regression?\n\nAs previously stated, Logistic Regression is used to solve classification problems. Models are trained on historically labelled datasets and aim to predict the category to which new observations belong.\n\nBelow are a few examples of binary classification problems which can be solved using logistic regression-\n\nThe probability of a political candidate winning or losing the next election.\n\nWhether a machine in manufacturing will stop running in a few days or not.\n\nFiltering email as spam or not spam.\n\nLogistic regression is well suited when we need to predict a binary answer (only two possible values, such as yes or no).\n\nLogistic regression comes from “Logistic Function,” or “Sigmoid Function.” Let’s learn more about it.\n\nLogistic/Sigmoid Function\n\nThe sigmoid function, commonly known as the logistic function, predicts the likelihood of a binary outcome occurring. The function converts any value to a number between 0 and 1. The Sigmoid Function is a machine learning activation function that introduces non-linearity to a machine learning model.\n\nFormula of Logistic Function\n\nWhen we plot the above equation, we get S shape curve like the one below.\n\nThe critical point from the above graph is that no matter what value of x we use in the logistic or sigmoid function, the output along the vertical axis will always be between 0 and 1.\n\nWhen the result of the sigmoid function is greater than 0.5, we classify the label as class 1 or positive class; if it’s less than 0.5, we can classify it as a negative class or\n\nMathematics Behind the Sigmoid Function\n\nLogistic regression is derived from Linear regression bypassing its output value to the sigmoid function, and the equation for the Linear Regression is:\n\nIn linear regression, we try to find the best-fit line by changing m and c values from the above equation, and y (output) can take any values from—infinity to +infinity. However, logistic regression in Python predicts the probability of an outcome between 0 and 1. So, to convert those values between 0 and 1, we use the sigmoid function.\n\nAfter getting our output value, we need to see how our model works. For that, we need to calculate the loss function. The loss function tells us how much our predicted output differs from the actual output. A good model should have less loss value. Let’s see how to calculate the loss function.\n\nWhen y=1, the predicted y value should be close to 1 to reduce the loss. Now, let’s see when our actual output value is 0.\n\nWhen y=0, the predicted y value should be close to 0 to reduce the loss.\n\nNow that we’ve covered the basics, let’s implement the Logistic Regression model.\n\nStep-by-step Implementation of Logistic Regression Model in Python\n\nBased on parameters in the dataset, we will build a Logistic Regression model in Python to predict whether an employee will be promoted.\n\nFor everyone, promotion or appraisal cycles are the most exciting times of the year. However, final promotions are only disclosed after employees have been evaluated on various criteria, which delays transitioning to new responsibilities. To speed up the process, we will build a machine-learning model to predict who is qualified for promotion.\n\nYou can better understand the problem statement by downloading the dataset from supervised learning.\n\nImporting Libraries\n\nWe’ll begin by loading the necessary libraries to create a Logistic Regression model.\n\nimport numpy as np import pandas as pd #Libraries for data visualization import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns #We will use sklearn for building logistic regression model from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\nLoading Dataset\n\nWe’ll use the HR Analytics dataset from the link above. We’ll start by loading the dataset from the downloaded CSV file with the code below.\n\nPython Code:\n\n# shape of dataset print(\"shape of dataframe is : \", data.shape) # summary of data data.info() # Get Statistical details of data\n\nUnderstanding the Data for Logistic Regression\n\nIt’s always a good idea to learn more about data after loading it, such as the shape of the data and statistical information about the columns in a dataset. We can achieve all of this with the code below :\n\n#shape of dataset print(\"shape of dataframe is : \", data.shape) # summary of data data.info() #Get Statistical details of data data.describe()\n\nThis dataset contains 14 variables and 54808 observations. “is_promoted” is our Target Variable, which has two categories encoded as 1 (promoted) and 0 (not promoted). The rest are input features. In addition, we can observe that our dataset contains numerical and Categorical features.\n\nData Cleaning\n\nData cleaning is a crucial stage in the data preprocessing process. We’ll remove columns with only one unique value because their variance will be 0, and they won’t help us anticipate anything.\n\nLet’s see whether any columns only have one unique value.\n\n#Checking the unique value counts in columns featureValues={} for d in data.columns.tolist(): count=data[d].nunique() if count==1: featureValues[d]=count # List of columns having same 1 unique value cols_to_drop= list(featureValues.keys()) print(\"Columns having 1 unique value are :n\",cols_to_drop)\n\nThis signifies that there isn’t any column having only one unique value.\n\nWe’ll now drop the employee_id column because it’s merely a unique identifier and then verify each field in the dataset for null value percentages.\n\n#Drop employee_id column as it is just a unique id data.drop(\"employee_id\",inplace=True,axis=1) #Checking null percentage data.isnull().mean()*100\n\nprevious_year_rating and education both features have null values. As a result, we will impute those null values instead of dropping them. Following our examination of those columns, we discovered that –\n\nFor rows with a null previous_year_rating, we can see that their length of service is 1, which could be why they don’t have a previous year rating. As a result, we’ll use 0 to impute null values.\n\nFor the education column, we will impute null values with mode.\n\n#fill missing value data[\"previous_year_rating\"]= data[\"previous_year_rating\"].fillna(0) #change type to int data[\"previous_year_rating\"]= data[\"previous_year_rating\"].astype(\"int\") #Find out mode value for education data[\"education\"].mode() #fill missing value with mode data[\"education\"]= data[\"education\"].fillna(\"Bachelor's\")\n\nOur data does not contain any null or missing values, so let’s proceed to the next step.\n\nExploratory Data Analysis Before Creating a Logistic Regression Model\n\nGetting insights from data and visualizing them is an important stage in machine learning since it gives us a better view of features and their relationships.\n\nLet’s look at the distribution of the target variable in the dataset.\n\n# cchart for distribution of target variable fig= plt.figure(figsize=(10,3) ) fig.add_subplot(1,2,1) a= data[\"is_promoted\"].value_counts(normalize=True).plot.pie() fig.add_subplot(1,2,2) churnchart=sns.countplot(x=data[\"is_promoted\"]) plt.tight_layout() plt.show()\n\nThe above charts show that promoted employee data is less than non-promoted employee data, indicating a class imbalance because class 0 has more data points or observations than class.\n\nLet’s visualize if there is any relationship between the target variable and other variables.\n\n# Visualize relationship between promoted and other features fig= plt.figure(figsize=(10,5) ) fig.add_subplot(1,3,1) ar_6=sns.boxplot(x=data[\"is_promoted\"],y=data[\"length_of_service\"]) fig.add_subplot(1,3,2) ar_6=sns.boxplot(x=data[\"is_promoted\"],y=data[\"avg_training_score\"]) fig.add_subplot(1,3,3) ar_6=sns.boxplot(x=data[\"is_promoted\"],y=data[\"previous_year_rating\"]) plt.tight_layout() plt.show()\n\nIf the avg_training_score value is higher for an employee, then the chances of getting promoted are higher.\n\nWe will plot correlations between different variables using a heatmap.\n\n#correlation between features corr_plot = sns.heatmap(data.corr(),annot = True,linewidths=3 ) plt.title(\"Correlation plot\") plt.show()\n\nNone of the features are highly correlated with each other except for the age and length of the service.\n\nFeature Engineering\n\nWe apply domain expertise in feature engineering to produce new features from raw data or convert or encode features. In this section, we’ll encode categorical features or create dummy features.\n\n#Converting Categorical columns into one hot encoding data[\"gender\"]=data[\"gender\"].apply(lambda x: 1 if x==\"m\" else 0) #list of columns cols = data.select_dtypes([\"object\"]).columns #Create dummy variables ds=pd.get_dummies(data[cols],drop_first=True) ds #concat newly created columns with original dataframe data=pd.concat([data,ds],axis=1) #Drop original columns data.drop(cols,axis=1,inplace=True)\n\nTrain-Test Split\n\nWe will divide the dataset into two subsets: train and test. To perform the train-test split, we’ll use Scikit-learn machine learning.\n\nTrain subset: We will use this subset to fit/train the model\n\nTest subset: We will use this subset to evaluate our model\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split #split data into dependent variables(X) and independent variable(y) that we would predict y = data.pop(\"is_promoted\") X = data #Let’s split X and y using Train test split X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X,y,random_state=42,train_size=0.8) #get shape of train and test data print(\"train size X : \",X_train.shape) print(\"train size y : \",y_train.shape) print(\"test size X : \",X_test.shape) print(\"test size y : \",y_test.shape)\n\nAfter splitting the dataset, we have 43846 observations in the training subset and 10962 in the test subset.\n\nAfter diving into the dataset, let’s move on to the next phase, feature scaling.\n\nFeature Scaling/Normalization\n\nWhy Feature scaling is important?\n\nAs previously stated, Logistic Regression uses Gradient Descent as one approach for obtaining the best result, and feature scaling helps to speed up the Gradient Descent convergence process. When we have features that vary greatly in magnitude, the algorithm assumes that features with a large magnitude are more relevant than those with a small magnitude. As a result, when we train the model, those characteristics become more important.\n\nWe need feature scaling to put all features into the same range, regardless of their relevance.\n\nFeature Scaling Techniques\n\nUsing feature scaling, we bring all the features into the same range. There are many ways to do feature scaling, such as normalization, standardization, robust scaling, min-max scaling, etc. Here, we will discuss the standardization technique we will apply to our features.\n\nIn standardization, scale features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It does not scale to a preset range. Scale features using the formula below:\n\nz = (x – u) / s\n\nWhere u is the mean of the training samples, and s is the standard deviation of the training samples.\n\nLet’s see how to do feature scaling in Python using Scikit-learn.\n\n#Feature scaling from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler scale=StandardScaler() X_train = scale.fit_transform(X_train) X_test = scale.transform(X_test)\n\nClass Imbalance\n\nWhat is the class imbalance?\n\nWhen a dataset exhibits a class imbalance problem, one category has more data points than another. This imbalance skews the distribution of class labels. Let’s examine whether our dataset faces a class imbalance issue.\n\n#check for distribution of labels y_train.value_counts(normalize=True)\n\nWe can observe that most labels are from class 0, and only a few are from class 1.\n\nIf we use this distribution to develop our model, it may become biased towards predicting the majority class since there will be insufficient data to learn minority class patterns. The model will start predicting every new observation as 0 or the majority class (in our problem, an employee is not promoted). We’ll get more model accuracy here, but it won’t be a decent model because it won’t predict class 1 or the minority class, which is a crucial class.\n\nAs a result, we must consider class imbalance when developing our Logistic Regression model.\n\nHow to Handle Class Imbalance?\n\nVarious approaches to dealing with class imbalance exist, such as increasing minority class samples or decreasing majority class samples to ensure that both classes have the same distribution.\n\nBecause we’re using the Scikit-learn machine library to create the model, it has a logistic regression implementation that supports class weighting. We will use the built parameter “class_weight” to create an instance of the Logistic Regression model.\n\nBoth the majority and minority classes will be given separate weights. During the training phase, the weight differences will influence the classification of the classes.\n\nAdding class weights penalises the minority class for misclassification by setting a higher class weight while decreasing the weight for the majority class.\n\nBuild and Train Logistic Regression model in Python\n\nTo implement Logistic Regression, we will use the Scikit-learn library. We’ll start by building a base model with default parameters and then examine how to improve it with Hyperparameter Tuning.\n\nAs previously stated, we will use the “class_weight” parameter to address the class imbalance. Let’s start by creating our base model with the code below.\n\n#import library from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression #make instance of model with default parameters except class weight #as we will add class weights due to class imbalance problem lr_basemodel =LogisticRegression(class_weight={0:0.1,1:0.9}) # train model to learn relationships between input and output variables lr_basemodel.fit(X_train,y_train)\n\nAfter training our model on the training dataset, we used our model to predict values for the test dataset and recorded them in the y_pred_basemodel variable.\n\nLet’s look at which metrics to use and how to evaluate our base model.\n\nModel Evaluation Metrics\n\nTo evaluate the performance of our model, we will be using the “f1 score” as this is a class imbalance problem. Using accuracy as a performance metric is not good; also, we can say that the f1 score is the go-to metric when we have a class imbalance problem. The formula for calculating the F1 score is as follows:\n\nF1 Score = 2*(Recall * Precision) / (Recall + Precision)\n\nPrecision is the ratio of accurately predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.\n\nPrecision = TP/TP+FP\n\nRecall is the ratio of accurately predicted positive observations to all observations in actual class – yes.\n\nRecall = TP/TP+FN\n\nF1 Score is the weighted average of Precision and Recall. Therefore, this score takes both false positives and false negatives into account.\n\nLet’s evaluate our base model using the f1 score.\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score print(\"f1 score for base model is : \" , f1_score(y_test,y_pred_basemodel))\n\nWe got a 0.37 f1 score on our base model created using default parameters.\n\nUp to this point, we saw how to create a logistic regression model using default parameters.\n\nNow, let’s increase model performance and evaluate it again after tuning the model’s hyperparameters.\n\nHyperparameter Optimization for the Logistic Regression Model\n\nThe model learns parameters like weight and bias from data, while hyperparameters dictate the model’s structure. Hyperparameter tuning, the process of optimizing fit or architecture, controls overfitting or underfitting. Algorithms like Grid Search or Random Search are employed for hyperparameter tuning.\n\nWe will use Grid Search, the most basic method of searching for optimal values for hyperparameters. To tune hyperparameters, follow the steps below:\n\nCreate a model instance of the Logistic Regression class\n\nSpecify hyperparameters with all possible values\n\nDefine performance evaluation metrics\n\nApply cross-validation\n\nTrain the model using the training dataset\n\nDetermine the best values for the hyperparameters given.\n\nWe can use the below code to implement hyperparameter tuning in Python using the Grid Search method.\n\n#Hyperparameter tuning # define model/create instance lr=LogisticRegression() #tuning weight for minority class then weight for majority class will be 1-weight of minority class #Setting the range for class weights weights = np.linspace(0.0,0.99,500) #specifying all hyperparameters with possible values param= {'C': [0.1, 0.5, 1,10,15,20], 'penalty': ['l1', 'l2'],\"class_weight\":[{0:x ,1:1.0 -x} for x in weights]} # create 5 folds folds = StratifiedKFold(n_splits = 5, shuffle = True, random_state = 42) #Gridsearch for hyperparam tuning model= GridSearchCV(estimator= lr,param_grid=param,scoring=\"f1\",cv=folds,return_train_score=True) #train model to learn relationships between x and y model.fit(X_train,y_train)\n\nAfter fitting the model, we will extract the best-fit values for all specified hyperparameters.\n\n# print best hyperparameters print(\"Best F1 score: \", model.best_score_) print(\"Best hyperparameters: \", model.best_params_)\n\nWe will now build our Logistic Regression model using the above values we got by tuning Hyperparameters.\n\nBuild a Model using Optimal Values of Hyperparameters\n\nLet’s use the below code to build our model again.\n\n#Building Model again with best params lr2=LogisticRegression(class_weight={0:0.27,1:0.73},C=20,penalty=\"l2\") lr2.fit(X_train,y_train)\n\nAfter training our final model, we must evaluate our Logistic Regression model using chosen metrics.\n\nModel Evaluation\n\nWe will evaluate our model on the Test Dataset by first predicting values on it.\n\nWe chose the “f1 score” as our performance metric above, but for learning purposes, let’s look at the scores for all of the metrics, including confusion metrics, precision, recall, ROC-AUC score, and ultimately, the f1 score.\n\nThen, we’ll compare our final model’s f1 score to our base model to see if it’s improved.\n\nWe’ll use the code below to calculate the score for various metrics:\n\n# predict probabilities on Test and take probability for class 1([:1]) y_pred_prob_test = lr2.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1] #predict labels on test dataset y_pred_test = lr2.predict(X_test) # create onfusion matrix cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_test) print(\"confusion Matrix is :nn\",cm) print(\"n\") # ROC- AUC score print(\"ROC-AUC score test dataset: t\", roc_auc_score(y_test,y_pred_prob_test)) #Precision score print(\"precision score test dataset: t\", precision_score(y_test,y_pred_test)) #Recall Score print(\"Recall score test dataset: t\", recall_score(y_test,y_pred_test)) #f1 score print(\"f1 score test dataset : t\", f1_score(y_test,y_pred_test))\n\nWe can see that tuning hyperparameters improved our model’s performance since the final model’s F1 score (0.43) was higher than that of the base model (0.37). After the hyperparameter tuning, the model got a 0.88 ROC-AUC score.\n\nThis allowed us to construct and test our logistic regression model on the Test dataset. More feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and cross-validation techniques can further improve its performance.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe began our learning journey by understanding the basics of machine learning and logistic regression. Then, we moved on to implementing a Logistic Regression model in Python. We learned key steps in Building a Logistic Regression model, such as data cleaning, EDA, Feature engineering, feature scaling, handling class imbalance problems, training, prediction, and evaluation of the model on the test dataset. Apart from that, we learned how to use Hyperparameter Tuning to improve the performance of our model and avoid overfitting and underfitting.\n\nThe media shown in this article are not owned by Analytics Vidhya and are used at the Author’s discretion.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions?"
