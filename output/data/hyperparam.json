      "# [Hyperparam Blog by Hyperparam Blog](https://blog.hyperparam.app/)\nHyperparam: How Browser-Based Tools Will Re-Shape AI\n\nWhat is the key to building the most advanced AI models? Data quality.\n\nEveryone wants better AI models: smarter, cheaper, and with style. How does one achieve that? Whether you’re a mega-scale AI company, or a small enterprise team, the only real lever for making better models is to construct a better training set.\n\nHow do you build a better training set? This is a question that has always been one of the most challenging, and labor-intensive parts of the data science process.\n\nWhy is data cleaning and data understanding so time-consuming? Because current tools often miss three key capabilities: 1) should enable very fast free-form data exploration by the user, which is key to finding insights in your data, 2) use AI models to assist looking at huge volumes of data that would be impractical for a person, and 3) should be simple to run locally in the browser and not depend on complex services and data pipelines. Instead, most tools are built around Python, arguably the worst language for creating modern, compelling UIs and tools. This might seem controversial, but think about what is the most common interface for python? Jupyter Notebooks. Notebooks are great for iteration and experimentation, but they are extremely weak when it comes to interactive data exploration. If you’ve ever tried to open a parquet file (the most common format for modern ML datasets) in a notebook it looks like this:\n\nThis table is practically useless. You can’t paginate to the next set of rows. You can’t even see the entire data in a cell (which in this case is an entire github source file). So how are you supposed to get an intuitive sense of your data if you can’t even see it?\n\nCan we do better? If you want to build a highly performant user interface, there is only one choice: JavaScript. The browser is the only place for building modern UIs.\n\nThe problem is that ML datasets are massive (often multiple gigabytes of compressed text data), so it’s not obvious if it’s even possible to work with large scale datasets in the browser. However, by using modern data formats like Apache Parquet, and clever frontend engineering, it is in fact possible to work with massive datasets directly in the browser.\n\nAside: Apache Parquet files are a column-oriented data structure that contains a built-in index. This allows tools like hadoop and duckdb to efficiently query parquet datasets without having to retrieve all the data. Furthermore it allows doing these queries without a server, simply by putting the parquet files in a storage service like S3. What if you could do this same trick in the browser, and pull in just the data needed to render the current view. Hello Hyparquet.\n\nHyparquet is a new JavaScript parquet parser which can efficiently query against parquet files stored in the cloud. This enables the creation of a new type of client-side only parquet data viewer which is significantly faster than anything that could be done with a server.\n\nThe goal here is to get data engineers to look at their data 👀 Anyone who has worked with data for a model before knows that looking at your data is the key to understanding the domain you’re trying to model, and it is virtually impossible to do good data science without looking at your data. Looking at your data is the easiest way to find data and model issues, and is a constant source of ideas of how to improve them.\n\nThis is one of the core workflows in data science: build a model, see what data was correctly or incorrectly modeled, fix the data and/or the model, and repeat. This is a repeatable, teachable process! And if it can be taught to a human data scientist, why can’t it be taught to a model to assist?\n\nCan you use a model to assist with dataset curation? The challenges are two-fold: 1) How do you leverage human expertise to express what you want from the model? 2) These datasets are huge, so the cost of running a model across all the data is expensive.\n\nYou need the human in the loop to express their intent for the data. There is not just one definition of “good” versus “bad” data. What matters is the question “is this data useful for the model I’m trying to build?” This is where the UI comes in as a way to allow the user to look at the data, and use the data to express their intent.\n\nAs for the cost, we are entering a new era of LLMs where for the first time it is affordable to do dataset-scale inference in which you run an entire dataset through a model to help filter and label data. In 2023 it cost $5,000,000 USD to process 1 trillion input tokens with a sota model (gpt-4-turbo). In 2024 it cost $75,000 USD to process 1 trillion input tokens with a similar model (gpt-4o-mini). This trend will continue to make dataset-scale inference accessible to model builders. Model-based quality filtering has already been used by Meta to filter the training set for llama3 using labels generated by llama2 [1].\n\nWe’re entering a new era in which dataset-scale inference and interactive, browser-based data exploration will define how AI models are built and refined. By combining efficient data formats, high-performance JavaScript interfaces, and affordable AI-based annotations, teams can finally put data quality front and center without prohibitively high costs or clunky workflows.\n\nThe future belongs to those who seamlessly blend human expertise with AI-assisted insights—an approach that makes data cleaning faster, more intuitive, and ultimately, far more effective in powering the next generation of advanced AI models."

Depends on the parameter, what ranges you search and, how you space your search. Eg for the lambda parameter searches in regularized linear regression (LASSO/RIDGE/ELASTIC NET... the sklearn implementation uses c which is lambda inverse IIRC) it doesn't make much sense to search the values between 0 and 1 by 0.1 step. Not a whole lot of difference observed in most of those values. Rather searching by power steps (0, 1E-4, 1E-3, 1E-2, 1E-1, 1) has proven much more useful in my experience.\n\n### Comment ID gvj6yfe with +15 score by [(e_j_white, Reddit, 2021-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mwl2zj/do_you_often_find_hyperparam_tuning_does_very/gvj6yfe/) (in reply to ID gviy33w):\nThis.\n\nFor L1/L2, I'll first scan by order of magnitude.

I generally don’t bother, even with big prod jobs that have 1+ month of time behind them. \n\nHowever, some defaults are bad, e.g.\n\n- another poster mentioned poor alpha/C defaults for regularized CV LR in sklearn. These should be exponentially distributed. I use e.g. [1e-3, 1e-2... 1e3]. Believe np.logspace will do this for you https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.logspace.html\n\n- XGB defaults are fine but not perfect. In particular, lrate is a little high and iters low. Similar story for other GBM/GBT packages. \nExample - don’t claim this is perfect obviously and this is using SKlearn interface iirc \nXGB_BINARY = XGBClassifier(\n    objective=\"binary:logistic\",\n    max_depth=5,\n    learning_rate=0.02,\n    n_estimators=400,\n    subsample=.9,\n    colsample_bytree=.8,\n    reg_alpha=.25,  # L1, will sparsify v weak features\n    tree_method= 'hist',  # fast with less overfit\n    grow_policy= 'depthwise',  # less overfit w/ hist vs. lossguide\n    n_jobs=-1,\n)\n\n- SKL RF defaults used to be terrible (20 trees, hurt me to see people use this). Fortunately now 100 default. However, for reasonable dataset size you can and likely should bump min leaf size up to 5-20 and min split to 10-30 ish. The default of sqrt features for classifier is also generally over aggressive and .5-.8 often works better. But ymmv, we’re getting into the weeds...\n\n\nAnyway, with decent knowledge of your tools, I find hyperparmeter tuning mostly useless, rarely turn to it unless optimizing a bunch of params with complex interactions in a pipeline (i.e. complex interactions between cat encoding, imputing, transformations, model, etc.) and then use Bayesian optimization / Gaussian process.\n\n## Comment ID gvjbsys with +12 score by [(a157reverse, Reddit, 2021-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mwl2zj/do_you_often_find_hyperparam_tuning_does_very/gvjbsys/) (in reply to ID mwl2zj):\nThe last time I ran a grid search on model hyperparameters I found an estimated ~$250 in real world performance compared to the default hyperparameters.

I think it's partly due to junior data scientists coming with a Kaggle-like mindset where you keep a dataset fixed and dedicate to iterate on the model. In industry, the opposite should happen since better data is the best investment of your time to improve models.\n\nAnother consequence is people giving too much importance to experiment tracking rather than project standardization and frameworks that help you iterate faster on the data.\n\n## Comment ID gvjhnnw with +3 score by [(sunhaze_clouddropper, Reddit, 2021-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mwl2zj/do_you_often_find_hyperparam_tuning_does_very/gvjhnnw/) (in reply to ID mwl2zj):\nFrom my experience it usually depends on the quality of your data, if you have a high error rate in your training set, or many ambiguous cases the default model will reach pretty close to the global optimum and changing the architecture won't help much.\n\nBefore playing with different architecture we usually try to apply the same evaluation metrics we use for the model (precision / recall) on the manual taggers that created the training set\n\n## Comment ID gviv052 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mwl2zj/do_you_often_find_hyperparam_tuning_does_very/gviv052/) (in reply to ID mwl2zj):\nTune the data with augmentation and generation.

I would say for real world problems that most people face, no, tuning won't yield a crazy amount of benefit (you should still do it though). If you're working with really dense data or more complex models, then yes, you may see the benefit (Eg Online retail data - where a 1-2% improvement could equate to a few million dollars).\n\nTLDR; you should always tune your model because its good practice, just dont expect a step change in performance.\n\nEdit: I think the best performance I've ever gotten out of tuning a model was around 8-10% on some kind of NN, most of the time, its sub 5% (mostly around 1-2).\n\n### Comment ID gvqf4mt with +1 score by [(CacheMeUp, Reddit, 2021-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/mwl2zj/do_you_often_find_hyperparam_tuning_does_very/gvqf4mt/) (in reply to ID gvkbin7):\nAre these 1-2% improvements statistically significant?\n\nWe measure them typically on a finite, and frequently small and older, test set.

I have 2 hyperparameters to tune and assuming each parameter could take on roughly 6 orders of magnitude, then I would have to run my network 36 times to find the best hyperparameters given this grid search.

Therefore, you could use a subset of your dataset if it's difficult to downscale your model. For example, let's say I'm training a Resnet152 model on ImageNet - if I wanted to reduce training time for hyperparameters, I could sample a subset of Imagenet (maybe 1/10 the size) and tune hyperparams on that, then test the best hyperparameter on the full dataset.\n\n### Comment ID ir1dktk with +18 score by [(bphase, Reddit, 2022-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xvem36/d_how_do_you_go_about_hyperparameter_tuning_when/ir1dktk/) (in reply to ID ir0zlg1):\nWouldn't it be more beneficial to just perform 1/10 the steps or epochs?

Train fully with that. Then double it for the same hyperparameters and see how the performance changes. You want to stop when the performance no longer changes significantly after doubling the data.\n\nHow much is significantly? Well, I would personally stop when doubling the data doesn't halve the test error. But that criterion is arbitrary, so ymmv, and you should adjust it based on how fast it increases. Think of what performance would be acceptable for an average person who is neither stupid, nor informed enough to know your model could be much better. You just need enough data to consider your hyperparameters representative.\n\nIf you do not know how to tune that, then try clustering your data strictly. Ex., if you have text, you could divide it into 2-grams, use MinHashes and then say the threshold for a cluster is 1% similarity. This will give you very few clusters from which you can pick the representative and use that as a sample for your dev test.\n\nSearch your hyperparameters randomly within a distribution when you reach those diminishing returns and then train with those hyperparameters on the full dataset. Depending on the network the diminishing returns point will be anywhere from 1k (CV resnets) to 100k samples (finetuning transformers).\n\n## Comment ID ir1b0gg with +4 score by [(HennesTD, Reddit, 2022-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xvem36/d_how_do_you_go_about_hyperparameter_tuning_when/ir1b0gg/) (in reply to ID xvem36):\nI don't quite get the idea behind training on a smaller subset of the data, although it might be just that it doesn't work in my case. \n\nIn my specific case I tried training an ASR model on Librispeech. \nTraining it on 1/10th of the Librispeech 360h data gave me pretty much the exact same loss curve in the first hours of training.

So, I have developed a strategy that is working reasonably well.\n\nFirst, I work with image data and I always start by training and evaluating models at a lower resolution. For example, if I were using the CelebA-HQ dataset I would do all initial development with 128x128 images, then scale up the resolution once my results are good. Often times things translate reasonably well when scaling up and this allows for much more rapid prototyping.\n\nAnother strategy that has worked well for me is fine tuning. I train a base model with “best guess” hyperparameters to completion. Then I fine tune for a quarter of the total training time, modifying one hyperparameter of interest while keeping everything else the same. For my work, this amount of time has been enough to see the effects of the changes and to determine clear winners. In a few cases, I have been able to verify my fine tuning results by training the model from scratch under the different configurations - this is what gives me confidence in the approach. I find that this strategy still works when I have hyperparemeters which impact one another; holding one constant and optimizing the other works pretty well to balance them.\n\nI should note that you probably don’t need to tune most hyperparameters, unless it is one you are adding. If it isn’t something novel I feel like there is bound to be a reference in the literature that has what you’re looking for. This is worth keeping in mind, I think. \n\nOverall, it’s not really worth going to great lengths to tune things unless your results are really bad or you’re being edged out by a competitor. However, if your results are really bad that probably speaks to a larger issue.\n\n## Comment ID ir0n1dy with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xvem36/d_how_do_you_go_about_hyperparameter_tuning_when/ir0n1dy/) (in reply to ID xvem36):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID ir0uhh2 with +3 score by [(twocupv60, Reddit, 2022-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xvem36/d_how_do_you_go_about_hyperparameter_tuning_when/ir0uhh2/) (in reply to ID ir0n1dy):\nYour very last thought seems the most reasonable.

Tune a smaller network, then apply the hyperparameters to the larger one and 'hope for the best'.\n2. As others have said, train less, for example, 10 epochs rather than 100. I typically find this produces the wrong results though (the best performer is often poor early on)\n3. For low dim (2d) perform a very coarse grid search (space samples an order of magnitude apart, maybe two), then use just the best model. This is often the best method as you don't want to overtune the hyperparameters.\n4. For high dim, just use random search, then marginalize over all but one parameter using the mean of the best 5-runs. This works really well.\n5. If the goal is often to compare two methods rather than to maximize the score, you can use other people's hyperparameters. \n6. Baysian optimization is usually not worth the time. In small dims do grid search, in large do random search.\n7. If you have the resources then train your models in parallel. This is a really easy way to make use of multiple GPUs if you have them.\n8.

I see at my current job how data crunching is important and tedious. I'm not sure how a ML project could easily be incorporated in a company that still relies on DOS systems but I see how crucial statistical analysis are to find root cause to production problems. \n\nI'm increasingly tempted for the above reason to hop into a 1 year professional master program on AI. However, I wonder what's the kind of job in medium/big corporate for data/ML engineer? I'm not looking to be a programmer because I'm not that young (28) and have a big physics background (I'm not competitive vs. someone who studied computer science for example). Should I attempt this?

I'd recommend at least 3-4 years of solid development experience in python before even considering a role like such. But that's just the programming. You'll need to be an expert in systems, math, and pretty good with business as well.\n\nIt's worth it. Not only are you at the top tier of engineering talent - but you can literally work at any company in nearly every industry. Don't like where you're at? Leave - walk into a new job next week. The job security and pay is unparalleled. You'll work like a madman to get here, but when you do, the benefits are nice.\n\nLet's get into the details - \n\nYou'll need to understand how parallelization/synchronization and mutithreading work. You'll also need to have some understanding of systems at scale: distributed architectures/databases and interprocess communication and the nuances of both.\n\nAs a physicist, you'll have the upper hand in understanding the functions which describe deep learning, since you'll be able to read the papers and understand the math.\n\nTensorflow and Keras make it pretty easy to get started with ML engineering. You'll learn more as you encounter problems you'll need to solve on projects.\n\nAs a working ML engineer, your work is dictated by the current project. There is no typical 9-5 as the workflow for model development changes as the project needs change. \n\nWorking as a consultant and in specialized data science teams, here's how it goes:\n\n\\- someone comes up with a problem to solve. This problem may warrant some advanced ML, but 75% of the time, it can be solved with simple models or even basic statistical analysis. Someone heard that AI was going to fix their shitty business processes without them having to do any work and need you to be the magician\n\n\\- You'll work to gather data. The data is almost always poor quality and you'll spend a good deal of time working with application developers and the engineers who built the systems to understand the data and the issues. Datasets in the real world are filled with fields like \"crhp\\_342\". If you're lucky, someone knows what that means. Most of the time, no.\n\n\\- You'll spend a lot of time trying to simplify explanations to people who don't understand anything about what you're doing. Best case: they leave you to work and deliver, and you do. The clients or business is led by smart, capable people who understand. Worst case: you're micromanaged by someone much dumber than you who thinks they understand the math, but don't. You spend a lot of time trying to play nice while gritting your teeth. If you're talented, and in a situation like this, leave. Either way, you'll need to master Feynman's techniques for simplifying complex math into easy to understand explanations. \n\n\\- You may build datapipelines for models you've developed. This requires an understanding of how to effectively move data from web systems to databases. There are a lot of frameworks out there to use\n\n\\- You'll also need to understand operating systems, specifically linux. Many jobs and models need to be scheduled on multiple machines. Tools like docker help.\n\nI hope this doesn't sound cynical, because when it's done right and the team is good, it's nerdvana. You spend days theorizing with brilliant people who can also execute at the same or even better than you. You learn more in a month than your average person learns in a few years.\n\nPeople are typically the worst part of this job. I can imagine that it's different working at deepmind or vicarious or any of the other AI thinktanks. I haven't had the experience, and have worked with some of the largest (non-silicon valley) companies in the world.\n\n### Comment ID eyn68ue with +1 score by [(Studyr3ddit, Reddit, 2019-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/cxhvbd/d_what_is_the_reality_of_machine_learning_engineer/eyn68ue/) (in reply to ID eylt82u):\n> I hope this doesn't sound cynical, because when it's done right and the team is good, it's nerdvana.

Of course this also involves a fair bit of programming but as I deal with the same type of data (Audio) our data cleaning and preprocessing is either mostly done or dealt with by signal processing people.\n\nInterestingly, while you find dozens of \"switch from software dev to data science\", you basically find none for the other direction.\nBut to be honest, while it's great that you always got the feeling that someone is working even while you're sleeping, it can be quite frustrating.\n\nSoftware development is like being a dictator. ML is like being a shepard trying to get a herd of mentally handicapped sheep to do your bidding. You check back after 2 days and most likely lot went wrong. Even worse, you often don't know why and start tuning hyperparameters like a money on steroids. Papers often just add this or that Lego brick to the architectures without much reasoning. Because it worked after hundreds of experiments.\nOnly that it stops working when you get to the next dataset.\n\nGenerative models are even worse because the loss function not necessarily fully correlates with human perception. So that really nice loss might be utter crap and again, you don't know why. So you not only check train and valid error but also have to manually check the 50 models you trained.\nseq2seq models often rely on teacher forcing during training. Without ground truth aligned data fed to the autoregression you are probably unable to get a meaningful loss. At the same time if you don't do teacher forcing the loss probably becomes completely useless as the resulting sequence might be 5 frames longer and perfectly fine for us humans but a catastrophe for the loss function.\n\nOK that was a detour. Software dev also got such frustrating aspects. But generally I roughly know why stuff fails or at least am able to figure it out. After more than 3 years with deep learning (and more than 10 development before that) I really enjoy whenever I can again just develop stuff and I know it will (mostly) work. It gradually grows and gets better.\nThose models on the other hand are still playing tricks on me all the time. The probabilistic work also means there is no 100%. Many non-tech people don't understand that. If there is a self driving car issue they call it a \"programming error\". Even if there is no correct answer. \n\nOf course,this all still beats working through business application tickets and writing unit tests by a large margin ;). But the feeling of achievement is often missing. I suddenly have a nice model because I set hyperparam x to 0.01 instead of 0.02, not because I did such a good work. In that regards I'm really looking forward to  AutoML style of work and also looking into probabilistic programming.\n\n### Comment ID f7bog45 with +1 score by [(BallJiggler, Reddit, 2019-11-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/cxhvbd/d_what_is_the_reality_of_machine_learning_engineer/f7bog45/) (in reply to ID eynljkx):\nWhat is your job title exactly?

To that end, day-to-day will be more general software engineering rather than \"getting into the weeds\" with ML. That said, whatever statistical background will definitely help with understanding things; the roles tend to blend into each other a bit anyway.\n\nIn small cos, the divisions of roles are generally similar but you'll probably have higher variance, with more in-between bleeding between these. \n\nRegardless of any of this, don't sell yourself short. Most (good) places don't actually care what your formal background was if you show that you can do the work. I've seen plenty of people with formal CS backgrounds get rejected after interviewing and people without (including those with physics backgrounds) get offers -- if you're worried about not having the right skills but are interested in the area, that sounds like a great opportunity for you to put some effort into learning some new interesting things. :)\n\n## Comment ID eylbzuj with +7 score by [(JustOneAvailableName, Reddit, 2019-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/cxhvbd/d_what_is_the_reality_of_machine_learning_engineer/eylbzuj/) (in reply to ID cxhvbd):\nI would recomend checking out books/small courses before actually figuring out if you want to switch careers.

The setting I'm working with is Bayesian linear regression, so I'm mostly interested in shrinkage priors which have a small number hyper parameters to tune.\n\nSo far I've come across full Bayesian inference, empirical Bayes estimate and cross-validation. However, I've not been able to find good explanations of how full Bayesian inference and the empirical Bayes estimate methods work. I'm familiar with cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning in the machine learning setting, but I'm not sure how it is used for hyperparameter tuning for priors in Bayesian statistics.\n\n## Comment ID iurh2j0 with +17 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-11-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/yk67mo/q_choosing_hyperparameters_for_priors_in_bayesian/iurh2j0/) (in reply to ID yk67mo):\nI think it's important to get out of the mindset of \"tuning\" when you're doing Bayesian data analysis.   Because either you have a lot of data (in which case they will be almost irrelevant compared to your model form and distribution choices) or you will have few data points and they will be influential but need to be theoretically justified.    \n\nTuning basically implies optimizing to data which is not what you're trying to do.  Granted, priors don't always represent true beliefs in practice, but they are usually set for reasons of convergence or flexibility.

We choose priors to reflect something we think is reasonable, and we run the model. If we're worried about sensitivity to the prior, we can either add a layer to the model or do a sensitivity analysis (or both). But if we pick our priors using the data, then we've got data in the prior and data in the likelihood and that's not great (I'm not against empirical Bayes methods, mind you, but the name of the game is caution).\n\nSo, for Horseshoes, if we have a prior that says the coefficients are Horseshoe(gamma), we wonder \"how do we set gamma?\" We can try to choose a reasonable value, let's call it gamma_0. We could use the methodology of Piironen and Vehtari, or we could try to use some prior probability that a coefficient is effectively 0. We can also put a prior on gamma. In which case, we want something with a decent mass near 0 and which keeps values from getting too excessive compared to gamma_0. Half-Cauchy priors are popular here, and you could use gamma_0 as your prior median. Now we've bought ourselves some extra flexibility. If our prior guess, gamma_0, isn't exactly right, the fact that we've got a distribution on gamma means that won't tank the whole analysis (probably, there are some cases where things are sensitive even to the parameters of the hyperprior, but then you just have to pick something reasonable and go with it).\n\nAs to the link someone shared to the R blog, I don't think that's so relevant. That's about optimization. Sure, you can do Bayesian optimization, that's MAP inference. But that's basically just regularized maximum likelihood, so you can do things you'd do elsewhere, and you won't be using Horseshoes. Horseshoes are designed to regularize posterior *distributions*, even means/medians. If you just want to regularize a point estimate for maximization, there's nothing wrong with L1/LASSO.\n\n### Comment ID ius2zra with +1 score by [(Peacemark, Reddit, 2022-11-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/yk67mo/q_choosing_hyperparameters_for_priors_in_bayesian/ius2zra/) (in reply to ID iurwij5):\nIn which cases would you use the Horseshoe as opposed to something like a Gaussian prior or student t for the regression coefficients?

We always have priors, so our posteriors are always identified even if we would have a nonidentifiability issue fitting the model with likelihood alone. In a perfectly valid sense, we don't have to give a shit about p > n (I mean, maybe we should, but the point stands). The question is, what do we want our priors to say? Or perhaps, what do we want to do with our model?\n\nYou use a Horseshoe (or related prior) when you want to either impose sparsity or when you want to do some sort of Bayesian model averaging or model selection. (Some people will quibble with whether you can really do BMA with shrinkage priors, but I have seen enough bimodal posteriors to believe it is possible.) So, you can do this with lots of parameters (say, p > n) or even with fewer if you're just interested in model averaging/selection.\n\nYou use some other prior when you don't want to impose sparsity, or when you're not trying to do one big model averaging/selection analysis. Some people like Normals. Some people prefer something heavier-tailed (like a t with df >= 3 or maybe a Laplace). People often like \"weakly informative\" priors here. Priors that are 0-centered and which have variances that keep most of the prior mass on sane values. What is sane? That's where domain expertise comes in, or perhaps a survey of meta-analyses in the field. I seem to recall seeing a paper that claimed most biomedical effect sizes were within [-2,2] but I can't seem to track the source down. You can also try to address it from first principles: if the covariate X generally is within the range X\\_l, X\\_h, would you expect to see the average at X\\_h be higher than X\\_l by 1? 10? 100? You can use the point at which you go from \"eh, maybe?\" to \"no way\" to produce a prior that keeps things in plausible regions.\n\nAs to uninformative and flat priors, my advice is: don't. A lot of blood and ink has been spilled in the quest for \"uninformative\" or \"objective\" priors, but I don't know how far it's gotten us. You've got Jeffreys priors, which are derived to be invariant under changes of parameterization. Is that convenient? In some cases. Is that objective? In a pig's eye. Then you've got reference priors, which are designed to maximize the difference between prior and posterior. Is that \"uninformative\"? Or is that just \"putting a prior that puts a lot of mass in dumb regions of the parameter space\"? (There are some lecture notes [here](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/courses/260-spring10/lectures/lecture7.pdf), lectures 6-8, that talk more about these.) And uniform priors are worse still. A colleague of mine once referred to flat priors as \"uniformative\" because uniform priors carry rather a *lot* of information. Consider an effectively semi-infinite uniform, a Uniform(0,DBL_MAX), which is [something like](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1848700/biggest-integer-that-can-be-stored-in-a-double) Uniform(0,1.8e308). The mean is 9.0e307, which is also effectively infinite. I don't know about you, but I haven't met a regression coefficient that exists [beyond the number of stars in the universe](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Herschel/How_many_stars_are_there_in_the_Universe).",

Then, make the model predict things that are useful for solving that task, with as much entropy as is still useful for your task.\n\nIf your data is invariable, change your task.

If you have also e.g the presence of clouds as a feature wouldn't the training reduce the entropy by also modeling the relationship between your 2 features?\n\nWhat I am getting at is how in a complicated setting would you make a decision on whether the entropy is reduced since in realistic scenarios you might have a large number of features, many of which might not even be easily interpretable. \n\nIf the dl paradigm had shown anything is that latent patterns are common but can only be leveraged given enough clean data or bigger model or more epochs of training or a combination of the above.\n\n#### Comment ID id4fwh7 with +7 score by [(jan_antu, Reddit, 2022-06-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vgoc1h/d_in_your_experience_whats_the_thing_that_can/id4fwh7/) (in reply to ID id3vhxu):\nThis is an incredible well said point, and basically the crux of the issue\n\nI do think that the addition of another feature here, like say cloudiness, could help. You end up with a prediction that doesn't claim to have any information about clouds, so you are at least ending up with a prediction that specifies less than the training data. Of course you have to balance the addition of new features with the risk of overfitting.\n\nHowever this is a toy example, mostly just to illustrate the point. Typically, as you say, in the DL environment you have:\n\n-\tmore data than you can realistically inspect as a human\n-\tenough features, often abstracted ones, to make interpretation difficult\n-\ta long delay before you get enough real-world validation to know if your mode works well\n\nAll of this makes the process of estimating entropy levels very difficult. There is no solid answer I can give you... personally I have had the most success from being extremely overzealous about it. \n\nFor example, rather than having a model to predict the affinity between a small molecule and a protein, I will use it to rank a population of small molecules. So much information is lost in the transition between rank-order list and individual prediction of affinity, you end up with a much safer final prediction from a usability standpoint. If you are intending to use these predictions to say, hypothetically, optimize a ligand to bind a protein via an evolutionary algorithm, then actually you don't **need** anything more than the rank order list of all the candidates. \n\nSo then this is what affords you the most opportunity: you can actually use a different metric to measure model performance, which is based on your higher-entropy final task.\n\nConceptually it's somewhere between reducing your risk of over-interpreting the results (minimizing the risk of overfitting), and \"hiding\" the inherent mistakes your model makes. \n\nUltimately however, I find it's best to think of it as what I call the \"Entropy Ladder\". At every stage, from data, to preprocessing, to training, to validation, etc, you need to ensure that total entropy is always increasing. Otherwise you are absolutely introducing errors.\n\nNo matter how much data you have, how long you train, or how big your model is, nothing will change the fact that your model is inherently a *summary* of the data. At best, it's a summary of the data *landscape*, which may contain implicit information that isn't overtly in the training dataset. If I’m understanding correctly this is what you mean by *latent patterns*. In this case, there is no magic entropy reduction, it's just that your overall dataset likely has more information and more *meaning* than is being captured by the model. This is best exemplified by a simple fact: you would be 100% unable to reproduce your original dataset using only your model, with 100% confidence and precision.\n\nSo, I make these decisions with care, from experience, aggressively in favor of increasing entropy when in doubt, and with the knowledge that I’m likely still making a mistake. More often than not it works out surprisingly well.\n\n### Comment ID id40l3y with +7 score by [(C_BearHill, Reddit, 2022-06-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vgoc1h/d_in_your_experience_whats_the_thing_that_can/id40l3y/) (in reply to ID id3ozjy):\nCan you explain what you mean by entropy in this context?\n\n#### Comment ID id4d7zj with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-06-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vgoc1h/d_in_your_experience_whats_the_thing_that_can/id4d7zj/) (in reply to ID id40l3y):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID id3fhar with +14 score by [(pilooch, Reddit, 2022-06-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vgoc1h/d_in_your_experience_whats_the_thing_that_can/id3fhar/) (in reply to ID vgoc1h):\nOK, data data data everyone is saying, that's kinda true, but most often you can't get more.\n\nSo don't under estimate carefully crafted architectures, especially for very specialized applications like GANs, GNNs, time series.

We wanted to capture that they are close, so the model could generally learn things that happen say near that time boundary.\n\nThe numeric representation creates an boundary in the data that doesn't exist in reality, and this feature enhancement technique removes it from the dataset.\n\nStuff like this is more important than tuning your learning parameters, because your data better represents reality and is thus more predictive, in my experience.\n\n#### Comment ID id3vjp9 with +1 score by [(nucLeaRStarcraft, Reddit, 2022-06-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vgoc1h/d_in_your_experience_whats_the_thing_that_can/id3vjp9/) (in reply to ID id3anhg):\nwhy not make them categorical and use one-hot encoding?\n\n#### Comment ID id411m0 with +1 score by [(vtec__, Reddit, 2022-06-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vgoc1h/d_in_your_experience_whats_the_thing_that_can/id411m0/) (in reply to ID id3anhg):\ncould you elaborate more on converting them to x,y coordinates?\n\n#### Comment ID idkt5k1 with +1 score by [(derHumpink_, Reddit, 2022-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vgoc1h/d_in_your_experience_whats_the_thing_that_can/idkt5k1/) (in reply to ID id3anhg):\nwhat kind of feature engineering do you do when working only with image data? there's not much more intricate to be done than cropping and random transformations like flipping, rotating, and hoping the model picks up *something*\n\n### Comment ID id3ahma with +13 score by [(Ulfgardleo, Reddit, 2022-06-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vgoc1h/d_in_your_experience_whats_the_thing_that_can/id3ahma/) (in reply to ID id2ro3q):\nA friend of mine who went to industry said one very smart thing:\n\nIn research you pretend that you have to solve a given task with both hands tied behind your back.\n\nThe standard dataset in research is there to make results between algorithms comparable, which is of little interest in an actual application domain.\n\n//edit And it is also not what actually happens in research.

Some we can train, gender, age, zip code, years in service, etc.  But others would be impossible to train since there are so many factors.  For example, we have a person come in with the following:  \n\n\nage: 43\n\nYears in service: 20\n\nZip code: 83333\n\nGender: Female\n\nBut there is also other data that would be important like the number of critical incidents, number of charges, disciplinary actions, previous medical history, medication, previous work locations, etc.  As you can image there is a lot of data.  We are looking for a pattern.  So if this person comes in and we analyze the record, we want the ML system to pick up the obvious \"trained\" factors we know to look for, but we would also like the ML to pick up trends.  So for example, this person is more susceptible to this condition, watch for this condition, history shows this person is more likely to suffer from these conditions.    \n\n\nFrom what I have seen, without trained dataset, [ML.NET](https://ML.NET) isn't quite there on forecasting and grouping untrained data yet.  I read it's coming.  Either that or I am just looking in the wrong place.\n\n### Comment ID kifcrgx with +1 score by [(cs_legend_93, Reddit, 2024-01-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/vh7xry/does_anyone_actually_use_mlnet/kifcrgx/) (in reply to ID id7zh8l):\nThis is excellent information.

This was enough to get the hyperparameters close-ish to their eventual values.\n\nThe next step was to scale up the working model, and this was what took the longest time. I monitored gradients because I was constantly getting gradient collapse even when I shouldn’t have in theory. Admittedly, figuring this out was a lot of trial and error, with training times between 1 and 4 hours at this stage.\n\nEventually, the culprit turned out to be the AMSGrad optimizer I was using, and I switched to a mix of NADAM and ADAMW instead. I then tested a bunch of configurations at the size that took 4 hours to train, manually graded them, and looked for any indirect metrics that might be useful for automated hyperparameter tuning. At this point, everything was working well enough at several different sizes that I was confident whatever metric I ended up with would also be useful at the final model size.\n\nIt turned out that a weighted ratio of the critic loss and its standard deviation fit the bill, so the final step was to run automated hyperparameter tuning using Bayes optimization for a few hyperparameters at the final model size. This took about a week, even though I trained with fewer epochs, so each run was about 12 hours. I kept all the other hyperparameters the same as in the smaller version.\n\nThankfully, all of this is pretty much a worst case scenario. Normally, you can use Bayesian optimization for much more of the process, and therefore automate it to a much greater extent.\n\n## Comment ID kfwf6wk with +8 score by [(ForceBru, Reddit, 2024-01-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/18w9jh8/is_hyperparameter_tuning_a_scam/kfwf6wk/) (in reply to ID 18w9jh8):\n> Is it something that is nice to do if you have the resources for it, but realistically it's rarely feasible?\n\nI think this is mostly correct, but not sure about \"rarely\". You might somewhat often find that very simple models work well enough. So you go ahead and quickly tune their hyperparameters. Not sure this happens \"rarely\" - it could be more common. For example, the Box-Jenkins approach for fitting ARIMA time-series models is literally based on hyperparameter tuning for finding the orders of the model.

It’s not solely about hyperparameter tuning, but the [revisiting resnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07579) paper really highlights how much impact things that aren’t the model architecture have on model architecture performance. (+3% Top-1)\n\nGenerally there is some overlap in hyperparameter performance on simpler tasks or shorter training to more complex tasks and longer training, so people get more tuning in by only doing very long training once the methods are mature. At least historically, people have heavily relied on early stopping in order to stop hyperparameter experiments with unpromising results before they consumed too many resources.\n\nFinally, this is one of the reasons that industrial labs have been so successful in DL. When you have a large budget for compute, you can spend it on more thoroughly investigating hyperparameter settings for your experiments and final models so you get higher quality results and more quickly find stable settings for hard-to-stabilize techniques like those commonly used in deep RL. All major groups developing DL algorithms —research, production, industrial, and academic — have standard recipes that they understand and have incrementally tuned, so they often get a solid head start when compared with people implementing things from scratch or tuning from basic reference implementations.\n\n### Comment ID kfz3gfz with +1 score by [(Educational_Roll_868, Reddit, 2024-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/18w9jh8/is_hyperparameter_tuning_a_scam/kfz3gfz/) (in reply to ID kfyj4tl):\nOh this is interesting to know.

There are a few different ways to tune a project like AlexNet depending on what resources you have available. Alex Krizhevsky did a couple of things explicitly focused on increasing training speed and thus increasing his hyperparameter iteration speed as well as overall quality. [He was one of the first  people to run ConvNets on parallel GPUs](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/), so he had access to much more compute resources than almost anyone else working on the problem at the time (section 3.2 in the paper). He also used ReLu activations in order to speed up the training time (section 3.1 in the paper).\n\nI don’t know exactly how he did it, but I can guess. He worked on the CIFAR datasets, so he may have roughed in his hyperparameters on those. His final results are from 90 epochs of training on imagenet, so it’s possible that he did the bulk of his tuning at 15 epochs. \n\n6 days is also not all that long, that’s 30 iteration cycles in a six month period assuming no early stopping. Not ideal, but definitely enough to make major improvements.\n\nIf he had more than two GPUs, he could have been running multiple training runs at once. This doesn’t improve the total number of iterations, but does increase the number of independent datapoints he can assess at each step, which would help quite a bit with a grid search.\n\nFor some modern context, [ImageNet is a pretty small dataset, so with enough compute, you can get Alex’s 30 cycles in less than a day.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05011#:~:text=State%2Dof%2Dthe%2Dart,Facebook's%20on%20corresponding%20batch%20sizes)\n\nAs long as you have the regularization for it, training for longer tends to just improve quality, so he might have found something good that runs in a day and then expanded the training time until he hit diminishing returns.\n\nWhile Alex is famously good at hyperparameter tuning, something else that is important to keep in mind is that the AlexNet results aren’t very good by modern standards. Even with an ensemble of models, the AlexNet paper reports 63.3% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. The current SOTA on Papers with Code for ImageNet-only training is 88.3% Top-1. This is ~2.7x as big of an improvement as AlexNet made over the previous (2011) ILSVRC winner.\n\nThere are other confounding factors and this definitely doesn’t take away from the paper at all, but it does reflect your intuition that AlexNet couldn’t have been tuned all that much given the reported training times (and knowledge at the time). It did, however, open up the floodgates for further work in the area as well as give everyone that follows a known good starting point.\n\n2. I wouldn’t expect them to work perfectly, but it’s definitely a better starting point than just guessing. In practice, ImageNet is the dataset that most people use as a starting point for their production tasks.\n\n## Comment ID kfzy0fj with +2 score by [(Snake2k, Reddit, 2024-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/18w9jh8/is_hyperparameter_tuning_a_scam/kfzy0fj/) (in reply to ID 18w9jh8):\nTo give a real life example:\n\nI work on a time series forecasting model that is a NN under the hood.

I've used optuna to do bayesian optimization of my hyper-parameters including learning rate schedule and I just choose 300 epochs so trials would complete in a reasonable amount of time. However, I can train the winner above 1000 epochs and the validation loss continues to drop (around 1700 it starts to overfit). I imagine if I did another search over learning rate schedules using 2000 epochs that I'd get a different schedule and that would continue to do better if trained even longer as well.\n\nWith Optuna, I stopped using pruners (like asynchronous successive halving) because I don't think the validation loss early in the training process says much about the final performance, and instead would be biased towards schedules with fast decays.\n\nSo how do these projects that commit to a model and train it for days or weeks choose a schedule that isn't going to be 100x to cautious or end up overfitting 20% into their training budget?\n\nI'd imagine there's a method for dynamically adjusting the learning rate based on generalization error and the derivative of validation loss. I.E. if it starts overfitting then bump up the learning rate to get out of that local minimum and try to settle into a new one. But I haven't found any papers in that direction.\n\n## Comment ID iojjsg1 with +75 score by [(koolaidman123, Reddit, 2022-09-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xeyzf7/d_how_does_one_choose_a_learning_rate_schedule/iojjsg1/) (in reply to ID xeyzf7):\nif model training takes a couple of days, then you can launch a couple of training jobs for a quick hyperparam sweep with some reasonable values for learning rate/number of epochs to get a good result, plus you can terminate jobs that aren't performing well early on, and it won't be that much of a loss\n\nif the scale is in number of weeks and above, you're likely only running 1 training job for often times, and the typically the data is large enough that you don't need to worry about overfitting (for ex llms are often trained for < 1 epoch). if anything, underfitting and training instabilities are more of a concern. in that case there's just using sensible default values + a lot of babysitting the training run. for example reloading an earlier checkpoint, and adjusting the learning rate up/down depending on performance. for example you can read the logbook for training OPT175B to get an idea of how to train a model at that scale https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/blob/main/projects/OPT/chronicles/OPT175B_Logbook.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0z0T2CjHkGNlIym6RVaIJI6iODBsyAUtR8SJd__uyIAbZQDeYgadZpNwM\n\nor the dalle mega training logs\nhttps://wandb.ai/dalle-mini/dalle-mini/reports/DALL-E-Mega-Training-Journal--VmlldzoxODMxMDI2\n\n\na trick i have done before, although it is by no means perfect, is to run hpo (or just a quick sweep) using only 5-10% of data, but going through the full training. in my experience it tend to get me a good starting point for hyperparameters, but how much better is it than default is debatable\n\n### Comment ID iojtkae with +7 score by [(elbiot, Reddit, 2022-09-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xeyzf7/d_how_does_one_choose_a_learning_rate_schedule/iojtkae/) (in reply to ID iojjsg1):\nThese logs are super informative!\n\n### Comment ID iomad55 with +3 score by [(blendorgat, Reddit, 2022-09-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xeyzf7/d_how_does_one_choose_a_learning_rate_schedule/iomad55/) (in reply to ID iojjsg1):\nThose logs are incredibly interesting to read! \n\nWhy in the world are these GPUs so prone to crashing though?

This schedule modifies the amplitude in a cyclic manner so that it goes up and down. In order to find the upper and lower bounds for your cycle amplitude you need to run this thing called Learning Rate Range Test (LRRT). You can find an implementation of this on PyTorch Lightning. Basically this test tries a bunch of learning rates on a given range. You don't need to train one full epoch because each learning rate is only tested on a single batch (in my case I have enough by testing 1000 different learning rates). Just Google about this LRRT and about triangular CyclicLR scheduler.\n\nThe scheduler also let's you define whether you want the amplitude of the cycle to be decreased as time passes which I would advise you to do in order to force convergence.\n\n### Comment ID ioo5s5z with +1 score by [(elbiot, Reddit, 2022-09-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xeyzf7/d_how_does_one_choose_a_learning_rate_schedule/ioo5s5z/) (in reply to ID ion7bh4):\nI've looked at cosine annealing, etc, and I don't think that answers my question because it's just more hyper-parameters that need to be searched over.

However, since it is publicly available I assumed many others would like to also have a look :)\n\n**Mimics \"Real-Life\" better than typical datasets**\n\nThis is a unique opportunity to work in a much more \"real-life\" setup than usual Kaggle. Because the datasets update daily.\n\n* so.. If you mess up and overfit..\n* You see it tomorrow! 😂\n\nAnyway, this is an ongoing project that is also beginner-friendly since it is highly documented. Many more Time Series / Finance-related notebooks will be released in the future so this can also serve as a \"first stop\" when studying Time Series analysis.\n\n## Baselines & Starter Notebooks\n\n|CV + Model|Hyperparam Optimization|Time Series Models|Feature Engineering|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|[Neural Network Starter](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/purgedgrouptimeseries-cv-with-extra-data-nn)|[MLP + AE](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/bottleneck-encoder-mlp-keras-tuner)|[LSTM](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/time-series-modeling-lstm)|[Technical Analysis #1](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/crypto-prediction-technical-analysis-features)|\n|[LightGBM Starter](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/purgedgrouptimeseries-cv-with-extra-data-lgbm)|[LightGBM](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/purged-time-series-cv-lightgbm-optuna)|[Wavenet](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/time-series-modeling-wavenet)|[Technical Analysis #2](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/crypto-prediction-technical-analysis-feats-2)|\n|[Catboost Starter](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/purgedgrouptimeseries-cv-extra-data-catboost)|[Catboost](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/purged-time-series-cv-catboost-gpu-optuna)|[Multivariate-Transformer \\[written from scratch\\]](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/time-series-modeling-multivariate-transformer)|[Time Series Agg](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/features-all-time-series-aggregations-ever)|\n|[XGBoost Starter](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/xgb-extra-data)|[XGboost](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/purged-time-series-cv-xgboost-gpu-optuna)|[N-BEATS](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/crypto-forecasting-n-beats)|[Neutralization](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/g-research-avoid-overfit-feature-neutralization/)|\n|[Supervised AE \\[Janestreet 1st\\]](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/1st-place-of-jane-street-adapted-to-crypto)|[Supervised AE \\[Janestreet 1st\\]](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/1st-place-of-jane-street-keras-tuner)|[DeepAR](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/probabilistic-forecasting-deepar/)|⏳Target Engineering|\n|[Transformer)](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/let-s-test-a-transformer)|[Transformer](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/sh-tcoins-transformer-baseline)||⏳Quant's Volatility Features|\n|||||\n|[Reinforcement Learning (PPO) Starter](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/g-research-reinforcement-learning-starter)|||⏳Wavelets|\n\n[About the validation: GroupTimeSeriesSplit](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/let-s-talk-validation-grouptimeseriessplit)\n\n(⏳ - in the making..)\n\nFork them as you please! Enjoy Yourself!\n\n## Auto updating - Full Price Datasets\n\nI created an up-to-today \\[auto updating\\] dataset which contains the full historical data for all assets of the competition so you can easily build models that utilize it. The datasets are split to each asset since they are much heavier than the competition data. The datasets have also been labeled as described in the competition overview and had been organized in a way that they are at the exact format of the competition data.\n\n**The goal of this is to provide a dataset that:**\n\n1. Contains the FULL history for each asset. Currently, the competition data goes back to 2018. This dataset contains data from even earlier.\n2. Auto updating daily - Due to the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market, we should train our models on the most recent data available. These datasets have a backend pipeline for collecting, formatting, and reuploading to kaggle. They are scheduled to be updated daily, every single day until the end of the competition.\n3. Preprocessed - The datasets had been ffilled to overcome any missing values issue that is present in the original competition dataset.\n\n**The Datasets:**\n\n* [Binance Coin](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-binance-coin)\n* [Bitcoin Cash](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-bitcoin-cash)\n* [Bitcoin](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-bitcoin)\n* [Cardano](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-cardano)\n* [Dogecoin](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-dogecoin)\n* [Eos.io](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-eos-io)\n* [Ethereum](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-ethereum)\n* [Ethereum Classic](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-ethereum-classic)\n* [Iota](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-iota)\n* [Litecoin](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-litecoin)\n* [Monero](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-monero)\n* [Maker](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-maker)\n* [Stellar](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-stellar)\n* [TRON](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-tron)\n\n>**Bonus dataset:** I've also uploaded a dataset containing the most powerful source for predicting cryptocurrencies movement: Elon Musk's Twitter 😂! It is simply an updated dataset of all Elon Musk's tweets 😂. I must check if Elon Musk can help us win! 👌 You can play with it yourself [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/elon-musks-twitter-updated-031121).\n\n\n\n**Technical details about the Data** For every asset in the competition, the following fields from [Binance's official API endpoint for historical candlestick data](https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs/blob/master/rest-api.md#klinecandlestick-data) are collected, saved, and processed.\n\n1. timestamp - A timestamp for the minute covered by the row.\n2. Asset\\_ID - An ID code for the cryptoasset.\n3. Count - The number of trades that took place this minute.\n4. Open - The USD price at the beginning of the minute.\n5. High - The highest USD price during the minute.\n6. Low - The lowest USD price during the minute.\n7. Close - The USD price at the end of the minute.\n8. Volume - The number of cryptoasset u units traded during the minute.\n9. VWAP - The volume-weighted average price for the minute. 10.Target - 15 minute residualized returns. See the 'Prediction and Evaluation section of this notebook for details of how the target is calculated.\n10. Weight - Weight, defined by the competition hosts [here](https://www.kaggle.com/cstein06/tutorial-to-the-g-research-crypto-competition)\n11. Asset\\_Name - Human readable Asset name.\n\n**Indexing** The dataframe is indexed by `timestamp` and sorted from oldest to newest. The first row starts at the first timestamp available on the exchange, which is July 2017 for the longest-running pairs.\n\n\nEnjoy Yourself! \nAnd thank you in advance for your support! This is not an easy system to maintain!\n\n## Comment ID hmusrwu with +50 score by [(Spentworth, Reddit, 2021-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/r6h3h8/p_i_created_an_autoupdating_kaggle_dataset_that/hmusrwu/) (in reply to ID r6h3h8):\nPredicting white noise is pretty hard.\n\n### Comment ID hmwj8xw with +7 score by [(MarkOates, Reddit, 2021-12-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/r6h3h8/p_i_created_an_autoupdating_kaggle_dataset_that/hmwj8xw/) (in reply to ID hmusrwu):\nYea.

Standard scaling is applied to input features to bring them to a similar scale, but for the target variable, it might not be necessary. You typically scale only the input features.\n\n- Make sure that the preprocessing steps applied to the unseen data are consistent with those applied to the training and test sets. Any transformations or scalings should be performed using the parameters (e.g., mean and standard deviation for StandardScaler) obtained from the training set.\n\n- Do you have any potential data leakage?\n\n- It's also possible that the unseen set has different distributions or patterns compared to the training and test sets?\n\n- The negative R2 on the unseen set kind of indicates overfitting or model complexity issues. You may need to simplify your model or use other regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.\n\n- Consider cross-validation instead of a single train-test split.\n\n#### Comment ID kfamvud with +1 score by [(InformationNo128, Reddit, 2023-12-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/18sprrz/machine_learning_model_not_generalizing_well_on/kfamvud/) (in reply to ID kf9zr5o):\nOk won't be that then. \n\nYou mention you did feature engineering on train/test.

Go down this list one by one and try to figure out if this reason is the cause. It's likely one of these will be the problem. That is, as long as your decision space is somewhat representable by whatever algorithm you are using given this size of data, since 10 example per dimension is not very many.  \n\n\nThe learning curves can tell you a lot: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning\\_curve\\_(machine\\_learning)\n\nFinally, it could be worth it to run feature selection on your input data and get yourself in a lower dimensional space, then check those three things again."
