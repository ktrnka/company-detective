      "# [Exa by Exa Labs](https://exa.ai/about)\nWill Bryk\n\nCEO\n\nWill was one of the first engineers at Cresta where he built real time AI products. He studied CS and physics at Harvard, where he researched human/AI interaction and led the robotics club. Will considers himself an expert in both embedding models and chocolate chip cookies -- the jury is still out on which is more critical for company operations.\n\nJeff Wang\n\nCo-founder\n\nJeff spent three years building data and web infra at Plaid. He studied CS and Philosophy at Harvard, where he ran a GPU cluster in his dorm room and was roommates with Will. The team estimates that 20% of social analysis in San Francisco traces back to one of Jeff's many viral tweets.\n\nBen Chen\n\nTechnical Staff\n\nBen previously did quant trading at SIG and before that took the hardest math course in the country at Harvard. When we find frisbees, tailor made suits, or scribbled math formulas lying around the office, there's usually a Ben behind it.\n\nHubert Yuan\n\nTechnical Staff\n\nHubert previously worked on projects like particle simulations and automated wheelchairs. He studied CS in the Yao Class at Tsinghua University. Hubert's appetite for clean microservice architecture is perhaps only matched by his appetite for Haribo sour candy.\n\nShreyas Sreenivas\n\nTechnical Staff\n\nShreyas previously worked on various projects, from training neural networks in Haskell to building a game streaming engine. He studied CS at the University of Waterloo. You can typically find Shreyas analyzing the price/performance of AWS services or crushing the team in basketball, sometimes at the same time.\n\nIsabelle Hughes\n\nGrowth\n\nIsabelle previously was at Mckinsey consulting for tech companies. She studied politics and philosophy at the University of Melbourne. Isabelle has the remarkable ability to work intensely on one screen while at the same time watching a technical lecture on another. The team is unsure whether this comes from McKinsey training or is just an Australian thing.\n\nEugene Chan\n\nTechnical Staff\n\nEugene previously designed and built LLM products at Palantir. He studied CS at Minerva University. Eugene loves two things and hates one -- designing beautiful frontends, optimizing high performance backends, and eating vegetables.\n\nMichael Fine\n\nTechnical Staff\n\nMichael previously worked on ML and privacy at various companies, including Apple. He studied CS at Harvard University. He also somehow finds time to cook chef-level meals and have PhD-level knowledge on nearly everything -- both of which the team enjoys consuming.\n\nThais Branco\n\nMarketing\n\nThais was previously VP of Marketing at Nate, Hubla and most recently co-founded her own startup in Brazil. She studied Economics and Econometrics at the University of Chicago. She might beat Exa's search in the amount of restaurant recommendations or Taylor Swift references she can provide on the spot.\n\nVishal Khanna\n\nGTM\n\nVishal was previously a management consultant at McKinsey & Co. and on the strategy team at TikTok Australia. He studied EECS and Finance at Monash University, Australia. Vishal is that rare person who can both code up a product and sell it to anyone. Given his messianic startup skills and obsession with Dune 2, some believe the similarity between 'Vishal' and 'Paul' is more than a coincidence.\n\nFelix Zeller\n\nTechnical Staff\n\nFelix previously worked on opensource projects from next-gen text editors to composable knowledge management systems. He (almost) studied CS and philosophy at UIUC until he realized that he is already a beast. The only job Felix should not do is corrosion engineering, because he deeply wishes to convert the world into rust.\n\nStacey Tara\n\nPeople + Workplace Ops\n\nStacey previously worked on business development at Awesomic. She got a bachelors and masters from Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, basically the Harvard of Ukraine. Stacey goes by many names at Exa -- workplace operator, recruiting coordinator, chief happiness officer -- but perhaps her most beloved name is \"greatest cookie baker of all time\". These cookies are unfairly delicious.\n\nElizabeth Trykin\n\nTechnical Staff\n\nElizabeth previously worked in product at Invert, building biotech software that helped grow cells. Before that, she worked with Shell to figure out their transition to clean energy. Elizabeth is someone who can do everything from automating bioprocesses to optimizing developer experiences, still finding the time to almost get eaten by bears on her weekend trail hikes.\n\nJoshua Ahn\n\nTechnical Staff\n\nJoshua previously studied CS at the University of Chicago, where he solved ML problems on 3D reconstruction. These days, he builds virtual worlds and massive lego datasets (and even bigger Exa datasets). Given his ML abilities and all the cities he's lived in across the Midwest/East Coast, some believe Joshua has neurally solved the Travelling Salesman Problem in polynomial time.\n\nIshan previously cofounded a text-to-video startup. Before that, he was a software engineer at Rephrase AI, which got acquired by Adobe. He has a Computer Science degree and has been coding since he was 13 years old. Ishan has so much energy and has shipped so many Exa apps that some on the team believe that when our LLM APIs are overprovisioned Ishan personally responds to each API request.\n\nYou\n\nTechnical staff\n\nYou previously worked on some project that demonstrated exceptional skill. You studied CS at somewhere, but far more importantly want to learn by joining a startup working on massive-scale ML/infra. You are excited to tackle a mission as old as ancient greece -- organize the world's knowledge -- and recognize that to do that You must meet Us and become We.",
      "# [Exa Search by Exa Labs](https://exa.ai/search)\nAbstract: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.",

      "# [Exa by Exa Labs](https://exa.ai/faq)\nWe use a transformer-based model to understand your query and return the most relevant links. Exa has embedded large portions of the web so you can make extremely specific and complex queries, and get only the highest quality results.\n\nGoogle search is mostly keyword-based, matching query words to webpage words. For example, a Google search for \"companies working on AI for finance\" typically returns links like \"Top 10 companies developing AI for financial services\".\n\nIn contrast, Exa's neural search understands meaning, returning actual company URLs. Additionally, Exa's results are not influenced by SEO, unlike Google/other engines, which can be affected by optimized content. This allows Exa to provide more precise and relevant results based on the query's intent rather than by keywords alone.\n\nExa is a new search engine built from the ground up. LLMs are models built to predict the next piece of text. Exa predicts specific links on the web given their relevance to a query. LLMs have intelligence, and are getting smarter over time as new models are trained. Exa connects these intelligences to the web.\n\nWe update our index every two minutes, and are constantly adding batches of new links. We target the highest quality web pages. Our clients often request specific domains to be more deeply covered - if there is a use-case we can unlock by additional domain coverage in our index, please contact us.\n\nWhen you search using a URL, Exa crawls the URL, parses the main content from the HTML, and searches the index with that parsed content.\n\nThe model chooses webpages which it predicts are talked about in similar ways to the prompt URL. That means the model considers a range of factors about the page, including the text style, the domain, and the main ideas inside the text.\n\nSimilarity search is a natural extension for a neural search engine like Exa, and something that's difficult with keyword search engines like google.\n\nWe have robust policies and everything we do is either in standard cloud services, or built in house (e.g., we have our own vector database that we serve in house, our own GPU cluster, our own query model and our own SERP solution). In addition to this, we can offer unique security arrangements like zero data retention as part of a custom enterprise agreement -- just chat with us!",

      "# [Exa by Exa Labs](https://exa.ai/blog/superknowledge)\nThe most important technical problem\n\nIlya Sutskever thinks \"building safe superintelligence is the most important technical problem of our​​ time\".\n\nI disagree. I think there’s a more pressing technical problem, one that needs to be solved first – superknowledge.\n\nThe world is far shorter on knowledge than intelligence right now. We’ll soon have near-AGI intelligences (GPT-5) relying on knowledge systems built for humans in the late 1900s (Google).\n\nThis is an absurd situation, even a dangerous one.\n\nWe need to build superknowledge before superintelligence. Let’s explore why.\n\nIntelligence is bottlenecked by knowledge\n\nIntelligence is different from knowledge.\n\nIntelligence is reasoning over an input. Knowledge is retrieving from a data repository.\n\nAll the recent advanced AI models have high intelligence, but surprisingly limited knowledge.\n\nFor example, GPT-4 can nail any highschool physics problem, but if you ask it to retrieve a list of physics PhDs in NYC – a relatively simpler request – you get this:\n\nGPT-4 does have some knowledge of the world, but it isn’t anywhere close to knowing everything -- every phd webpage, every news article, blog post, youtube video, tweet, reddit post, meme, etc.\n\nThat's why LLMs are often combined with a search engine. The LLM brings the intelligence, and the search engine brings the knowledge. At least, in theory. Unfortunately today’s search engines can't handle simple knowledge requests either:\n\nKnowledge systems like Google haven't improved much over the past decade (arguably, they’ve gotten worse). In contrast, intelligence systems improve every month.\n\nThat means intelligence is increasingly bottlenecked by knowledge.\n\nLuckily, we now have technology like transformers, which enable radically new knowledge systems. That's what our team at Exa is working on. I believe we're only a few years away from building superknowledge.\n\nWhat is superknowledge?\n\nSuperintelligence is a system that can handle extremely complex reasoning requests.\n\nSuperknowledge is a system that can handle extremely complex retrieval requests.\n\nWe've achieved superknowledge when there exists an API that can handle any knowledge request over available information, no matter how complex.\n\nSuperknowledge would handle requests like:\n\n\"all physics PhDs in NYC\" (should return all 457 physics PhDs in NYC and any associated metadata)\n\n\"The org chart of every AI startup in the Bay Area started in the past 3 years sorted by employee count, where the founders have some experience training LLMs in pytorch\" (should return a perfect comprehensive list)\n\n\"All the apartments in SF that have a window facing a courtyard and air conditioning and don't have any reviews about smell complaints, sorted by price\" (if you happen to be superknowledgeable about this one plz DM me)\n\nIn short, superknowledge gives everyone comprehensive knowledge of anything as quickly as they want.\n\nI believe we urgently need this comprehensive knowledge, both to progress society and to safeguard it.\n\nSuperknowledge unblocks progress\n\nIf you want to accelerate human progress, superknowledge is perhaps the most overlooked way to do it.\n\nProgress is a constant cycle of learning what's out there and trying something new. Superknowledge eliminates any bottlenecks to the first step so that all energy can be focused on the second.\n\nDoctors would get a deep analysis of all previous studies involving similar symptoms before making their diagnosis\n\nAI researchers would instantly gather every experimental result related to any new idea they think up\n\nSoftware engineers would find every C++ project containing the code snippets they need\n\nJournalists would in real time see every fact that supports or negates what their interviewee states\n\nInvestors would never miss a climate tech opportunity that fits their portfolio\n\nArtists would find every modern painter in Denver who they should meet when they travel there\n\nSupply chain managers would identify the best possible supplier for every stage of the rocket assembly pipeline\n\nSuperknowledge would make us all superproductive and superinformed.\n\nIn our personal lives, much of our time is wasted searching -- for apartments, events, clothing, interesting articles, solutions to personal problems, etc. Superknowledge gathers all information for you in 2 seconds, not 2 days.\n\nSometimes we even waste not days, but months or years of our lives because we didn’t learn something existed until later – the perfect job opportunity, the right medical treatment. With superknowledge, you’d have a smart alert system so that you're fully in the know about any topic. No more \"I wish I knew that earlier\", for anything.\n\nProgress will accelerate most from combining superknowledge with an intelligence like GPT-5. GPT-5 can handle the planning and processing while superknowledge handles the retrieval.\n\nLet’s say you want help finishing a research paper. GPT-5 + superknowledge would take each paragraph in your paper and find all the similar ideas from across the web (papers, blog posts, tweets, videos, etc). Then it would find the counterarguments to each of those ideas. Then the counterarguments to the counterarguments, and so on. It would feel as if a week-long academic conference had analyzed your paper, but in 2 seconds.\n\nOn the other hand, GPT-5 + Google would get stuck because Google can’t handle queries like finding similar ideas or counterarguments.\n\nIt’s difficult for us to fathom how quickly progress will accelerate when every intelligence – whether human or AI – is unblocked by all the knowledge that’s out there.\n\nSuperknowledge prepares us for superintelligence\n\nSuperknowledge doesn’t just accelerate us toward an advanced future, it also accelerates us toward a safer one.\n\nWhen people list the biggest threats to humanity, they don’t usually put the state of our knowledge as the top threat, but it actually is.\n\nThat’s because our knowledge underlies everything in our society – what problems we care about, how we act toward others, which politicians we choose, etc. Every societal malfunction is downstream from bad knowledge.\n\nUnfortunately, our current knowledge ecosystem is a mess. Knowledge is scattered across billions of webpages with no tool powerful enough to organize it all. That makes it extremely hard to become truly well-informed on any issue – you never know what knowledge you’re missing.\n\nWhen people aren’t well-informed, they make the wrong decisions, elect the wrong leaders, and cause inefficiencies throughout society. This is causing real problems, from inane housing laws to actual war.\n\nThe rise of agentic AI systems multiplies this problem dramatically. If AIs are stuck with the same knowledge tools as humans, then we’ll just have thousands more intelligences operating over the same incomplete knowledge. These AIs will interact with billions of people daily and perform actions on their behalf. They will be highly intelligent but misinformed, a dangerous combination.\n\nOur society deserves something better. Building superknowledge is the solution.\n\nSuperknowledge advances safety because it lets people or AIs quickly become well-informed on any topic – from the technologies related to carbon removal to the laws that should govern AI itself. I’d much rather take advice from an AI that analyzed the 10,000 relevant arguments on the web over one that read the first 10 links of a Google search.\n\nWe're now entering the most volatile decade in human history. It’s essential that humans and AIs can rely on a mature knowledge ecosystem that guides us through the chaos.\n\nWe just better build it before superintelligence arrives.\n\nWe're building superknowledge\n\nIt’s no accident that the Bible begins with a story about the tree of knowledge. For 5,000 years, humans have dreamed of knowing everything. We’re going to achieve that dream in about 3 years, and I think it’ll be powered by Exa. This is a historic mission, biblical even.\n\nI’ve personally dreamt of knowing everything for two decades, since I was a little kid lying prone on my 4-foot tall outer-space book wondering what it all means. We're finally almost there.\n\nIt's interesting that no-one else is working on this. While there are dozens of labs working on superintelligence, as far as I'm aware there's only one organization in the world working on superknowledge – Exa.\n\nThat’s partly because building superknowledge requires an organization with the right incentives. Organizations with ad-based revenue models will not build it. Exa, in contrast, has a usage-based revenue model. We’re highly incentivized to give users full control to retrieve whatever knowledge they need. Turns out users would pay a lot for superknowledge.\n\nAnother reason no one's building superknowledge is that it’s hard. We need to design novel ML architectures in a novel research field while building a novel search business. That’s not including all the massive infrastructure required for crawling, storing, processing, and serving petabytes of web data.\n\nYet superknowledge seems more attainable than superintelligence. It requires fewer magical breakthroughs. We have a pretty clear roadmap to get there.\n\nThe clock is ticking. To safely navigate the next decade, we need to build superknowledge before SSI, OpenAI, or some other organization builds superintelligence. For the Exa team, this is the most important technical problem of our time.",

It's absolutely not faster (yet, we're working on it) than those services if latency is your biggest concern. But its cheaper, and the reranking and chunking is also parametrically done by an agent, as opposed to the static params (that we suspect) they're using. \n\nfeel free to check it out: [https://critiquebrowser.app/en/flow-api](https://critiquebrowser.app/en/flow-api)\n\nit supports structured output parsing, so if you want in-line citation style responses, you can use the search api as is, but if you want structured output, you can specify a JSON schema and it'll return that to you.

I don't think o3 level reasoners have a real moat beyond:\n\n1. Enough (inference level) compute to make it commercially viable, which I'm almost certain OAI is struggling with\n2. Enough training compute, especially for coherent long context reasoning chains (I'm also skeptical here)\n3. A good enough meta-RL setup to boostrap itself to generate better synthetic data for the next loop\n\nNone of these are real moats. #1 - #2 are a matter of money and chip architecture. #3 is well known and any ole lab with enough money can easily replicate the work if OAI succeeds. Hell, when I was at G, #3 was already considered back in 2021 (back when we called everything scratchpad reasoners), but folks prioritized other low hanging fruits first. I still don't think enough low hanging fruits have been picked off, and given the compute figures coming out of OAI, I'm starting to think they're being squeezed into a tough spot if they're going all in on this already.\n\nSo this is why I think it's hype - because it's an old idea that is easily replicable. If OAI does it and it proves viable, every lab will very quickly (in O(weeks)) follow suit. The only thing that differentiates them is if consumers think that theirs is more special than the wagonload that will follow (that is already following). The way to do that is to hype and market.\n\n#### Comment ID m8cqw4e with +1 score by [(windsostrange, Reddit, 2025-01-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1i6dpet/ceo_of_exa_with_inside_information_about_open_ai/m8cqw4e/) (in reply to ID m8bhk71):\nDid you even read the comment you're replying to?

Finally, intelligence to me is ability to compress and decompress data on the fly in order to complete reasoning tasks. Current models can decompress data on the fly but has trouble with compressing - it happens during training. But training is slow and very compute expensive.\n\nI wonder how they want to make agents work but I expect them to be very primitive at the beginning. It will be probably just something similar that relevanceai does and that's it.

To not accept this is to ignore a huge amount of recent evidence. And you have to consider the insane rate of improvement, not just the current capabilities of current models. I've been talking to people who build these models for years, and there has been a stark change in their opinions recently. RL combined with transformers is a genuine breakthrough, one that labs were trying to make for years and now finally have.\n\nA good thought experiment -- try to come up with a task that humans can do on the computer today that you're very confident these systems in 1 year won't be able to do.\n\nIf you struggle to do that, that should tell you something. \n\nI am not claiming in the post that these models are AGI by end of year, just that we have basically all the techniques to get there pretty straightforwardly.

It’s not because I believe a random twitter hype post. More because I am seeing how model performance is reacting to the test-time scaling reasoning and it really does seem like the last domino to fall before we have useful agents that can stay on task and solve novel problems that require both vast knowledge and reasoning.\n\nI think as humans, we are going to have an incredibly difficult time accepting that these capabilities exist. They challenge our view of our own place in the universe.\n\nI feel like there’s one final domain where we see basically zero progress, humor. AI cannot crack a decent joke. I think that’s probably because it is non-sentient. The unexpected litmus test for subjectivity is the ability to laugh and if an entity can’t laugh, it can’t create a funny joke. Intelligence appears to be a separate capability that does not require sentience and we will have incredibly powerful non-sentient AGIs that, in principle, are tools because as long as we align them, they have cannot be said to have a motive.\n\nI think this is a best case scenario, incredible power and possibility, but under human control.

As someone who spends way too much time online (don't we all?), I'm both curious and worried about what this means for the web we know and love.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\n* These AI search engines like Perplexity are pretty impressive. They can give you quick answers without having to dig through a bunch of SEO-stuffed websites.\n* It's kind of amazing how they can understand and summarize complex topics.\n\nThe concerning stuff:\n\n* What happens to all the bloggers, journalists, and content creators who rely on web traffic?\n* There are some serious copyright issues when AIs just grab and repackage other people's work.\n* I worry about ending up in an AI echo chamber where we lose the diversity of voices that make the internet great.\n\nBut I don't think it's all doom and gloom. I believe there's a way for AI search to enhance the internet rather than replace it. Here's what I think a \"good\" AI search engine could look like:\n\n1. Always really highlight the original sources and make it easy to visit the full articles - I don't mean just a tiny footnote or cut off source box\n2. Find a way to promote and compensate original content creators\n3. Focus on discovering new, high-quality content rather than just recycling the same top results\n4. Give users tools to fact-check and contribute their own knowledge\n\nThere is no one search engine that does all of these things well. While I like Perplexity (despite the wrong answers), I'm really uncomfortable with how their AI Pages feature is straight up SEO spam. Publishers like Forbes and Wired have accused it of plagiarism, and the sources are totally buried. They've started showing up in Google results for me. That seems bad. You .com looked promising early-on but has lost its way with the answers getting worse. Google's AI Overviews are just awful.\n\nI like the idea of open source alternatives like Simplicity or the self-hosted Developers Digest, but they don't fix these problems per se, although you could roll your own version at least.\n\nI've always liked the little indie search engines Andi and Exa (which was called Metaphor before), even if they're a little obscure. Andi promotes original website creators really well (almost like a visual Instagram feed) and often surprises me with oddball or unusual stuff, but often you have ask it to \"write about\" something before it gives an AI answer. I like Exa for finding interesting and unexpected pages.\n\nAm I alone caring about this, or are other people worried about it too? How can we make sure AI search engines make the internet better, not worse?\n\nLinks:\n\nAndi - [https://andisearch.com](https://andisearch.com)\n\nDevelopers Digest - [https://github.com/developersdigest/llm-answer-engine](https://github.com/developersdigest/llm-answer-engine)\n\nExa - [https://exa.ai](https://exa.ai)\n\nPerplexity - [https://perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai)\n\nSimplicity - [https://smpl.pongo.ai/](https://smpl.pongo.ai/)\n\nYou - [https://you.com](https://you.com)\n\n## Comment ID las05no with +8 score by [(PSMF_Canuck, Reddit, 2024-06-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1dr0sq9/are_startup_ai_search_engines_going_to_kill_the/las05no/) (in reply to ID 1dr0sq9):\nVast majority of content “creators” provide no value add - they will die.\n\nPeople always find their echo chamber, of that’s what they want.

Not only that it's going to put a-lot of business, professionals out of business. And here is why i think that.\n\nOriginal search engines have way more focus on SEO, whereas ai search engines can use NLP as a replacement for SEO.\n\nBecause NLP is so strong at detecting a users search request i really don't see SEO jobs being a big thing anymore in the future.\n\nNext to that, depending on the approach being used for the ai search engine. There will be made use of a dataset. Datasets are the most important thing in the future of any ai model since they determine the quality and accuracy of the ai model.\n\nDatasets need a specific set of data for their training, and most of it comes from big data companies.

Deepmind and OpenAI have been openly talking about this for at least two years. Noam Brown was banging this drum right before OpenAI hired him.\n\nThe problem is that no one knows how to do it. “Just add search” is a lot easier in domains with explicit actions and states. Text doesn’t have that, though one of the reasons everyone gets so excited about LLMs-as-world-models is that you can sorta fuzzily imagine some sort of Dreamer-like architecture that plans via LLM-as-world-model.\n\nAs far as I know, no one knows how to do it. Instead, everyone kinda just asks LLMs to plan, autoregressively in text-space by using CoT or whatever. But that sucks. Turns out it’s brittle and works best on the kinds of problems that exist in the training data already broken down into multiple steps: math-y word problems, github tickets, etc.\n\nIf you could actually do search in the intermediate layers of a transformer, in embedding space, you’d have a multi-billion dollar breakthrough.\n\n### Comment ID l8v28ei with +10 score by [(gwern, Reddit, 2024-06-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/1dgxmnj/ai_search_the_bitterer_lesson_mclaughlin/l8v28ei/) (in reply to ID l8t6ng9):\n>  you’d have a multi-billion dollar breakthrough.\n\nMore than that! But yes, 'LLM search' is one of those \"known unknowns\" right now: we all know that some sort of search is necessary, we all know that search would have *enormous* impact if gotten right, but all of the approaches tried so far suck (even DeepMind apparently can't get it right & who knows more about DL+search than them?) and no one has any idea when, if ever, someone will get it right. Perhaps someone will drop an Arxiv paper tomorrow that is the 'AlphaGo of LLMs'; or perhaps we never will and will just keep scaling, and in 2028 the AGIs will inform us that they finally cracked it, and we'll go, \"oh, that's nice. So what did we all get wrong?\" and settle some old scores.\n\nSo despite the massive implications (about which I think I mostly agree with OP), it's hard to talk or think about. You can plan your research or startup around existing scaling laws and sensibly plan on \"what if I have a cheap GPT-5 in a year?\" but you can't really plan around \"what if someone finally makes the big search breakthrough by Q4 2024?\".\n\nI mean, what are you going to do - sit around and do nothing because, \"if someone solves LLM search next month, all my work is useless\" (which is true of an awful lot of LLM research right now)? Well, what if they *don't*?\n\n#### Comment ID l8yl1cn with +3 score by [(suedepaid, Reddit, 2024-06-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/1dgxmnj/ai_search_the_bitterer_lesson_mclaughlin/l8yl1cn/) (in reply to ID l8v28ei):\n> More than that!\n\nHaha i actually originally wrote “trillion-dollar breakthrough” but thought i might be overestimating a little.\n\nAgree with all of what you wrote. I actually think, w.r.t. text-domain, it’s probably better to plan for search NOT coming, given how hard it’s proven to do in code/math. If even the highly structured, easily verified parts of the space prove challenging, it leaves me skeptical the rest is gonna fall in the next year or two.\n\nOn the other hand, [stuff like this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06592) keeps chipping away!\n\nI’ve often wondered if text diffusion models could work for this problem too, in some iterative, course-to-fine hierarchical thing. That feels, intuitively, closer to my writing process then tree-based search.\n\nOne other thing I’ll mention about the original post — I was a bit surprised at the flop tradeoff curves they reported. I recall a talk Noam Brown gave where he mentioned that for (I believe) poker, he saw 3 or 4 orders of magnitude difference between raw network and network+search.

Models for the planner and content writer depend on complexity and output.  If I need something complex in terms of formatting and prose, I use a large model, otherwise I use a small model for those too.\n\nThat said.  Most of what I have these doing is hitting some information source or the web in general, aggregating updates, stories, and events within a time period and summarizing those with a light bit of trend analysit. So the complexity is fairly low and small is likely sufficient for all of it. \n\nThese all work very well for my use cases, but I have problems in these regions.\n\n1. It is inconsistent in it's output.  The means the formatting is not easy to control specifically, but it doesn't matter all that much to me but if you need it exactly the same everytime, expect to do some manual editing.  \n2. The same problem as everyone where I may have to do multiple runs, becasue the agents get lost on some faulty logic, or just plain stop working.  \n3. They miss information here and there on any indiidual reports.  So if you absolutly have to have everything, this could be a problem.

      "# [Had It with Google search hassles? Discover Exa’s AI-powered search by Tom Parish, medium.com on 2024-07-12](https://medium.com/@tparish/had-it-with-google-search-hassles-discover-exas-ai-powered-search-71f98214e8a1)\nWhether I’m writing a blog post for Substack, researching guests for a podcast show, or preparing notes for a personal essay — I need help researching the facts. A few weeks ago, I found the Exa.ai search, which employs AI in a way that works for me. Exa searches the web and attempts to ‘understand’ your prompt and the contents of the resulting search. Now I have realized how lacking Google search has been for me.\n\nI use Google out of habit, and I often find myself slogging through search results that feel more like an interpreted guess of what Google ‘thinks’ I want. Sadly, I end up on websites that bombard me with flying ads and pop-up videos that destroy my focus, or the suggested links are often marginally useful.\n\nAI for Lifelong Learners is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a paid subscriber.\n\nGetting started with Exa\n\nTake a look at the Exa home page. Notice you have the option of improving the prompt you write. I find it helpful to try searches with this on and sometimes with it off. The point is, that you have the option, and you’re in control. Exa’s search algorithm is less susceptible to SEO manipulation, meaning it can bypass the clutter of SEO-optimized content and deliver results that are genuinely relevant to the query. Eventually, I can find what I’m looking for if I’m persistent, but there is an easier way.\n\nExa allows users to search using natural language queries, making it more intuitive and user-friendly.\n\nLet’s research a topic to experience how Exa’s interface makes it easy to find and learn about what you’re searching for.\n\nWhat are the current cohousing trends in America?\n\nI want to research current trends in cohousing in America. Google interpreted my request as current housing trends in America. I understand how that can happen, but as I scroll down the results, I’m not finding what I want.\n\nBut when I try the same search out in Exa.ai I get — cohousing related search results. This might be good enough but the Exa interface has several features on the left-hand side that help me drill down, way down, into more detail.\n\nNotice on the left ‘Category’ and ‘Publish date’ — you have options! Use them. If I’m looking for something recently published, I can get that. If I want something back in time, I can get that with a few simple clicks. The interface is clean and fast.\n\nShow More, Add to Chat, See Similar\n\nNow for the fun options.\n\nHover over the right side of a search result and notice three options light up when you roll over them.\n\nThe first option is Show More Info, which summarizes the article.\n\nNext is Add to Chat — this feature uses AI to chat with the document you want to know more about without bringing the document up. It’s like getting a chance to peak at the contents without halting your mental flow as you look for topics of interest. We all know what it’s like clicking around and bringing up a web page only to find the contents are not useful. This happens with SEO-stuffed articles that are trying to trick Google into placing them higher up in the search results.\n\nFinally, the last little icon (the little lens) is See Similar results. This saves you the hassle of digging deeper for related posts without having to start a new search process. I find the results significantly more useful than doing multiple searches on Google, and a lot faster.\n\nBring up Exa.ai and start learning something you always wanted to know about that makes a difference in your life. Start researching that next book!\n\nTom\n\nAI for Lifelong Learners is a reader-supported publication.\n\nAlso see:\n\nGetting familiar with Google NotebookLM",
      "# [Exa AI: A true AI search engine by Brain Titan, braintitan.medium.com on 2024-07-20](https://braintitan.medium.com/exa-ai-a-true-ai-search-engine-should-be-the-google-of-ai-348332aa5c9c)\nBrain Titan\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n5 min read\n\n·\n\nJul 20, 2024\n\n--\n\nAnother AI search engine is born: Exa AI. The company recently announced that it has received $17 million in Series A funding, led by Lightspeed, with participation from Nvidia’s NVentures and Y Combinator.\n\nUnlike other AI-driven search engines that aim to replace Google, Exa aims to create a search tool designed specifically for AI.\n\nExa’s Mission :\n\nThe Internet contains humanity’s collective knowledge, but the current search experience is more like navigating a garbage dump than wandering through a library of knowledge. The core problem is that Internet knowledge is buried under a large amount of information.\n\nExa’s mission is to organize the world’s knowledge, filter information and extract real knowledge through better search algorithms.\n\nUnlike traditional search engines, Exa’s search engine is designed specifically for AI models to help them search for information on the Internet and return accurate answers, rather than relying on keyboard input from human users.\n\nExa’s search engine uses vector databases and embedding models to train models to predict the next relevant link rather than the next word. This approach enables Exa to process link datasets and provide unique search results.\n\nExa can understand complex queries and accurately filter Internet information by using embedding models to convert web page content into a list of values. This method can better understand and match query content and return results that are more in line with actual needs.\n\nExa’s technical advantages :\n\nExa is the first web-scale neural search engine that uses end-to-end Transformer technology (the same technology as ChatGPT) to filter by meaning rather than keywords.\n\nFor example, searching for “startups working on climate change” on Exa will return startups that are actually working on climate change, rather than irrelevant pages that are optimized for the keyword.\n\nModel training:\n\nExa’s model training data set includes shared links on web pages, rather than simple text and sentences. This allows its search engine to better understand and predict the relevance of web page links.\n\nExa’s search engine doesn’t just predict the next word, but the next related link. This means that its model training is not based on the continuous word sequence of natural language, but on the relationship and structure of web page links.\n\nIn other words, its model learns how to navigate from one link to the next related link, rather than generating coherent text.\n\nExa’s training method focuses on predicting the most relevant links, avoiding SEO spam in traditional search engines and low-quality AI-generated content.\n\nMain functions and features:\n\nSemantic Search : Exa’s search engine is able to understand semantic meaning, not just keyword matching, to provide more relevant search results.\n\nContent crawling : You can crawl complete and cleaned content from any web page to provide high-quality data for AI.\n\nSimilarity search : Find similar results by URL or long text, making the search more accurate.\n\nLarge-scale data processing : Able to process up to 1 million search results, meeting the needs of AI large-scale data processing.\n\nReal-time updates : crawl new URLs every minute to ensure that the AI ​​always has the latest data.\n\nPowerful filtering capabilities : You can search by domain name, date range, or data category, providing a highly customized search experience.\n\nSimple API integration : Exa provides a simple and easy-to-use API, developers can integrate and use Exa’s search function with just a few lines of code.\n\nExa AI’s technical principles\n\n1. Embedding Model :\n\nDefinition : Embedding models are models that convert text into high-dimensional numerical vectors (embeddings). These vectors mathematically represent the content of the text so that similar content is closer in the vector space.\n\nImplementation : Exa uses the same technology as ChatGPT to train an embedding model to convert web page content into vector representations, making the search process smarter and more precise.\n\n2. End-to-end Transformer model :\n\nDefinition : Transformer is a neural network architecture widely used in natural language processing tasks. It captures the relationship between various parts of the text through a self-attention mechanism.\n\nApplication : Exa uses an end-to-end Transformer model to filter Internet information based on the actual meaning of the query rather than keywords. This approach enables Exa to better understand complex queries and provide more accurate search results.\n\n3. Efficient information filtering :\n\nProblem : Traditional search engines (such as Google) rely on keyword matching and are easily interfered with by SEO optimized content, returning a large amount of irrelevant information.\n\nSolution : Exa uses embedded models and Transformer technology to filter information based on the actual meaning of the query, avoid irrelevant and low-quality content, and return truly relevant knowledge.\n\n4. Real-time content extraction :\n\nDefinition : Exa’s “highlights” feature can instantly extract web page content from search results and customize the length and amount of content according to user needs.\n\nImplementation : Exa chunks and embeds full web pages in the background, using a paragraph prediction model to extract content. This enables Exa to provide high-quality search results instantly when users query.\n\n5. Long query processing :\n\nCapabilities : Exa is able to process long queries, including sentences, paragraphs, and even entire web pages. This means that users can ask more complex and specific questions, and Exa will still be able to return accurate results.\n\nApplications : This is very useful for research work, writing assistants, learning tools, and other application scenarios that require detailed information.\n\n6. High-quality retrieval :\n\nRequirements : Large language models (LLMs) require high-quality retrieval results to ensure the quality of output content.\n\nImplementation : Exa provides high-quality web retrieval for LLMs, filters out low-quality and irrelevant information, and ensures that the output content of LLMs is of high quality.

      "# [Exa by Exa Labs](https://exa.ai/blog/superknowledge)\nThe most important technical problem\n\nIlya Sutskever thinks \"building safe superintelligence is the most important technical problem of our​​ time\".\n\nI disagree. I think there’s a more pressing technical problem, one that needs to be solved first – superknowledge.\n\nThe world is far shorter on knowledge than intelligence right now. We’ll soon have near-AGI intelligences (GPT-5) relying on knowledge systems built for humans in the late 1900s (Google).\n\nThis is an absurd situation, even a dangerous one.\n\nWe need to build superknowledge before superintelligence. Let’s explore why.\n\nIntelligence is bottlenecked by knowledge\n\nIntelligence is different from knowledge.\n\nIntelligence is reasoning over an input. Knowledge is retrieving from a data repository.\n\nAll the recent advanced AI models have high intelligence, but surprisingly limited knowledge.\n\nFor example, GPT-4 can nail any highschool physics problem, but if you ask it to retrieve a list of physics PhDs in NYC – a relatively simpler request – you get this:\n\nGPT-4 does have some knowledge of the world, but it isn’t anywhere close to knowing everything -- every phd webpage, every news article, blog post, youtube video, tweet, reddit post, meme, etc.\n\nThat's why LLMs are often combined with a search engine. The LLM brings the intelligence, and the search engine brings the knowledge. At least, in theory. Unfortunately today’s search engines can't handle simple knowledge requests either:\n\nKnowledge systems like Google haven't improved much over the past decade (arguably, they’ve gotten worse). In contrast, intelligence systems improve every month.\n\nThat means intelligence is increasingly bottlenecked by knowledge.\n\nLuckily, we now have technology like transformers, which enable radically new knowledge systems. That's what our team at Exa is working on. I believe we're only a few years away from building superknowledge.\n\nWhat is superknowledge?\n\nSuperintelligence is a system that can handle extremely complex reasoning requests.\n\nSuperknowledge is a system that can handle extremely complex retrieval requests.\n\nWe've achieved superknowledge when there exists an API that can handle any knowledge request over available information, no matter how complex.\n\nSuperknowledge would handle requests like:\n\n\"all physics PhDs in NYC\" (should return all 457 physics PhDs in NYC and any associated metadata)\n\n\"The org chart of every AI startup in the Bay Area started in the past 3 years sorted by employee count, where the founders have some experience training LLMs in pytorch\" (should return a perfect comprehensive list)\n\n\"All the apartments in SF that have a window facing a courtyard and air conditioning and don't have any reviews about smell complaints, sorted by price\" (if you happen to be superknowledgeable about this one plz DM me)\n\nIn short, superknowledge gives everyone comprehensive knowledge of anything as quickly as they want.\n\nI believe we urgently need this comprehensive knowledge, both to progress society and to safeguard it.\n\nSuperknowledge unblocks progress\n\nIf you want to accelerate human progress, superknowledge is perhaps the most overlooked way to do it.\n\nProgress is a constant cycle of learning what's out there and trying something new. Superknowledge eliminates any bottlenecks to the first step so that all energy can be focused on the second.\n\nDoctors would get a deep analysis of all previous studies involving similar symptoms before making their diagnosis\n\nAI researchers would instantly gather every experimental result related to any new idea they think up\n\nSoftware engineers would find every C++ project containing the code snippets they need\n\nJournalists would in real time see every fact that supports or negates what their interviewee states\n\nInvestors would never miss a climate tech opportunity that fits their portfolio\n\nArtists would find every modern painter in Denver who they should meet when they travel there\n\nSupply chain managers would identify the best possible supplier for every stage of the rocket assembly pipeline\n\nSuperknowledge would make us all superproductive and superinformed.\n\nIn our personal lives, much of our time is wasted searching -- for apartments, events, clothing, interesting articles, solutions to personal problems, etc. Superknowledge gathers all information for you in 2 seconds, not 2 days.\n\nSometimes we even waste not days, but months or years of our lives because we didn’t learn something existed until later – the perfect job opportunity, the right medical treatment. With superknowledge, you’d have a smart alert system so that you're fully in the know about any topic. No more \"I wish I knew that earlier\", for anything.\n\nProgress will accelerate most from combining superknowledge with an intelligence like GPT-5. GPT-5 can handle the planning and processing while superknowledge handles the retrieval.\n\nLet’s say you want help finishing a research paper. GPT-5 + superknowledge would take each paragraph in your paper and find all the similar ideas from across the web (papers, blog posts, tweets, videos, etc). Then it would find the counterarguments to each of those ideas. Then the counterarguments to the counterarguments, and so on. It would feel as if a week-long academic conference had analyzed your paper, but in 2 seconds.\n\nOn the other hand, GPT-5 + Google would get stuck because Google can’t handle queries like finding similar ideas or counterarguments.\n\nIt’s difficult for us to fathom how quickly progress will accelerate when every intelligence – whether human or AI – is unblocked by all the knowledge that’s out there.\n\nSuperknowledge prepares us for superintelligence\n\nSuperknowledge doesn’t just accelerate us toward an advanced future, it also accelerates us toward a safer one.\n\nWhen people list the biggest threats to humanity, they don’t usually put the state of our knowledge as the top threat, but it actually is.\n\nThat’s because our knowledge underlies everything in our society – what problems we care about, how we act toward others, which politicians we choose, etc. Every societal malfunction is downstream from bad knowledge.\n\nUnfortunately, our current knowledge ecosystem is a mess. Knowledge is scattered across billions of webpages with no tool powerful enough to organize it all. That makes it extremely hard to become truly well-informed on any issue – you never know what knowledge you’re missing.\n\nWhen people aren’t well-informed, they make the wrong decisions, elect the wrong leaders, and cause inefficiencies throughout society. This is causing real problems, from inane housing laws to actual war.\n\nThe rise of agentic AI systems multiplies this problem dramatically. If AIs are stuck with the same knowledge tools as humans, then we’ll just have thousands more intelligences operating over the same incomplete knowledge. These AIs will interact with billions of people daily and perform actions on their behalf. They will be highly intelligent but misinformed, a dangerous combination.\n\nOur society deserves something better. Building superknowledge is the solution.\n\nSuperknowledge advances safety because it lets people or AIs quickly become well-informed on any topic – from the technologies related to carbon removal to the laws that should govern AI itself. I’d much rather take advice from an AI that analyzed the 10,000 relevant arguments on the web over one that read the first 10 links of a Google search.\n\nWe're now entering the most volatile decade in human history. It’s essential that humans and AIs can rely on a mature knowledge ecosystem that guides us through the chaos.\n\nWe just better build it before superintelligence arrives.\n\nWe're building superknowledge\n\nIt’s no accident that the Bible begins with a story about the tree of knowledge. For 5,000 years, humans have dreamed of knowing everything. We’re going to achieve that dream in about 3 years, and I think it’ll be powered by Exa. This is a historic mission, biblical even.\n\nI’ve personally dreamt of knowing everything for two decades, since I was a little kid lying prone on my 4-foot tall outer-space book wondering what it all means. We're finally almost there.\n\nIt's interesting that no-one else is working on this. While there are dozens of labs working on superintelligence, as far as I'm aware there's only one organization in the world working on superknowledge – Exa.\n\nThat’s partly because building superknowledge requires an organization with the right incentives. Organizations with ad-based revenue models will not build it. Exa, in contrast, has a usage-based revenue model. We’re highly incentivized to give users full control to retrieve whatever knowledge they need. Turns out users would pay a lot for superknowledge.\n\nAnother reason no one's building superknowledge is that it’s hard. We need to design novel ML architectures in a novel research field while building a novel search business. That’s not including all the massive infrastructure required for crawling, storing, processing, and serving petabytes of web data.\n\nYet superknowledge seems more attainable than superintelligence. It requires fewer magical breakthroughs. We have a pretty clear roadmap to get there.\n\nThe clock is ticking. To safely navigate the next decade, we need to build superknowledge before SSI, OpenAI, or some other organization builds superintelligence. For the Exa team, this is the most important technical problem of our time.",
      "# [Generate a Newsletter with Exa Research Agent and CrewAI by Alejandro AO on 2024-06-01](https://alejandro-ao.com/crewai-with-exa-research-agent-newsletter/)\nLinks:\n\nExa\n\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/alejandro-ao/exa-crewai\n\nFollow me on X (Twitter): @alejandro_ao\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the last few months, there has been growing interest in building AI agents that can perform tasks for us. These agents can be used to automate repetitive tasks, like generating text or creating images, and even to perform more complex tasks like research and data analysis.\n\nWhat We Will Build\n\nIn this tutorial, we use Exa and CrewAI to build a team of AI research agents who, given any topic, can perform the following tasks for us:\n\nResearch and summarize the latest news on the given topic.\n\nVerify that the sources are correct and that the articles are relevant to the selected topic.\n\nCompile the top stories into a newsletter using an HTML template.\n\nWhat We Will Learn\n\nIn order to build this, we will use:\n\nCrewAI: a framework to orchestrate a team of AI agents.\n\nExa: the first semantic search API that can retrieve high-quality, relevant web content for our LLM.\n\nWhat Is Exa\n\nVery broadly, Exa is a semantic search engine. This means that you can search for information on the web using natural language rather than keywords. You can think of it as an alternative to Google, but instead of searching by ‘keywords’, it searches by ‘meaning’. You can get 1000 free Exa requests just for signing up!\n\nSemantic Search\n\nThe fact that Exa uses semantic search is especially useful for our project, and will allow us to find the exact news that we are looking for.\n\nAs mentioned before, we will be creating a research agent. This agent should be able to find the latest news on a given topic, which is something that semantic search is better for.\n\nThink about it: if you search for ’latest news on AI’ on Google, you will get a lot of front pages of news websites and blogs that talk about AI. Like this:\n\nBut we don’t want the front pages of blogs that post news about AI. We want the latest news articles themselves. This is what makes Exa so unique: it is able to tell the meaning of the query and return results that correspond to that meaning, not just the keywords.\n\nFor contrast, when looking for ’latest news on AI’ on Exa, you get this:\n\nThis is a much better result for our research agent.\n\nWhat Is CrewAI\n\nCrewAI is an orchestration system that allows you to create a team of AI agents that can perform tasks for you. With very little code, you can design a crew of agents that can reason by themselves, use tools to perform tasks, and communicate with each other to achieve a common goal.\n\nTo install CrewAI, you can use pip:\n\nTo learn more about CrewAI, you can visit my step-by-step guide on how to use it here.\n\nStep 1: Create the Crew\n\nThe first thing to do is to create the crew that will perform the tasks for us. We can build it ourselves using the core components of CrewAI (agents, tools, and tasks) or we can use the CrewAI CLI to create the crew for us. Let’s use the CLI to create the crew:\n\nThis will create a new folder called newsletter-crew. You will find here all the components that you will need to create and orchestrate your agents. In it, you can also find the src/config folder, which contains the configuration files for your crew: agents.yaml and tasks.yaml. These will be automatically loaded to the CrewAI system if you are using the CLI.\n\nConsider that this command initializes a Poetry project, so if you want to add any dependencies, you should do it using Poetry:\n\nStep 2: Create the Tasks\n\nInput and Output\n\nBefore we start building our crew, we need to define the tasks that our agents will need to complete. This is the backbone of your crew. Once you have the tasks that your agents will perform, you can start creating your agents. But in order to define your tasks, you need to know what your input and expected output are. In our case:\n\nInput: the topic of the newsletter\n\nOutput: the HTML code of the newsletter.\n\nOnce you have that, you can start listing the tasks that your agents will need to complete to get from input to expected output. Think of it as a to-do list for your agents.\n\nHow to Define Tasks\n\nThis is usually where things can get tricky. But don’t worry! With some practice, you will be able to create a set of tasks for any automation within a few minutes!\n\nMy advice is to make a list of the to-do items that you would need to complete the task yourself. Then, break down these items into specific and granular tasks that your agents can perform.\n\nHere are some tips for creating your crew:\n\nAvoid tasks that are too complex: If you try to perform too many actions in a single task, it can confuse the agent. For example, asking it to research a topic, summarize it, expand it, and reorder the results might be too much. Instead, break down the task into smaller, simpler tasks.\n\nPerform thorough testing until you get reliable results: You will need to run your crew several times, varying your input to make sure that your agents are working correctly.\n\nHave a monitoring setup: We will not cover monitoring and observability in this tutorial, but consider that you should be able to trace what your agents are thinking and doing. This is crucial for improving your prompts.\n\nFor this tutorial, our tasks will be:\n\nResearch task. To complete this task, the agent will need to:\n\nSearch for the latest news on the given topic.\n\nSelect the most relevant articles.\n\nSummarize the articles.\n\nEdit task. To complete this task, the agent will need to verify that the sources are correct and that the articles are relevant to the selected topic. The agent in charge of this task will also need to improve the summary, add a title, and a comment to the article.\n\nHTML task. To complete this task, the agent will need to replace the selected stories in an HTML template to generate the final newsletter file.\n\nAs I mentioned above, this is a trial and error process. I started off with 4 tasks (I had an extra summary task), but I found that the researcher can do the summary as well without any issues. So I removed the summary task, and now I have 3 tasks. :)\n\nFill the tasks.yaml File\n\nNow that we have our tasks, we can fill the tasks.yaml file with the tasks that our agents will need to complete. Think of it as writing the prompt for your agents. A task in CrewAI contains the following properties:\n\nDescription: A detailed prompt outlining what the task is supposed to do.\n\nExpected Output: The expected output of the task. This is what the agent should return when the task is completed. You can use Few-Shot Learning (include a few examples of the expected output) here.\n\nTools: The tools that the agent can use to complete the task. You can also bind the tools to the agent instead of the task.\n\nAfter some testing and iterations, I came up with the following tasks:\n\nStep 3: Create the agents\n\nNow that we have our tasks, we can start creating the agents that will perform the tasks. An agent in CrewAI is a LangChain Runnable that can use tools to perform tasks. The agent can use the tools to perform the tasks that we defined in the tasks.yaml file.\n\nTo initialize an Agent object, you can specify many parameters. But the most important ones are:\n\nRole: This can be researcher, editor, html_generator, etc.\n\nGoal: This is a brief description of what your agent’s overal goal is. Try to be precise and give your agent a good idea of what its importance is within the entire project.\n\nBackstory: This is a brief description of the agent’s background. This is useful to give your agent a personality and a particular expertise. For example, you can say that the agent is a senior journalist known for its wit and humor. This will influence the writing style of the agent.\n\nHere is an example of an agent that I created for the research task:\n\nStep 4: Create the tools\n\nThe tools are the functions that the agents will use to perform the tasks (that is why it is so important to use an LLM that supports function calling). We will then bind these tools to the agents when initializing them.\n\nIn this example, we will be giving the research tools to the researcher and editor agents. The tools that we will be using will use the following methods from the Exa client:\n\nsearch_and_contents: This tool will search a given query and return the full text contents each article.\n\nfind_similar: This tool will find similar articles to the ones that we pass in.\n\nget_contents: This tool will get the contents of a given URL.\n\nHere is an example of the tools that I created for the researcher agent:\n\nAs you can see, the tools are simple classes that inherit from BaseTool and have a _run method that returns the result of the tool.\n\nIt is very important to properly document the tools with a name and description attribute. This will help the agents understand what the tool does and how to use it.\n\nIt is also a great idea to include an example of the input and output of the tool in the description.\n\nStep 5: Put everything together\n\nOnce that everything is put together, you can put everything together in your crew.py file. This file will initialize the agents and tasks, bind the tools to the agents and create the crew.\n\nHere is an example of a crew.py file:\n\nNote that this is the crew.py file that was generated by the CrewAI CLI. It uses some decorators to make simple tasks easier, such as loading the configuration files and creating the agents and tasks. These decorators deal with some logic behind the scenes that might obscure the code a bit. For example, by using the @agent, @task and @crew decorators, the framwork will automatically create the properties self.agents, self.tasks and pass them to the Crew object.\n\nPass the inputs to your crew\n\nNow you just have to pass the inputs to your crew. This is found in the main.py file that was generated by the CLI. Here is an example of how you can pass the inputs to your crew:\n\nNotice that we are passing the inputs to the crew here. These are the variables that were passed to the prompts in the tasks.yaml and agents.yaml files (those in curly braces {}).\n\nStep 6: Run the crew\n\nOnce everything is set up, you can run the crew using the CrewAI CLI. Remember that we are using poetry to manage the dependencies, so you should make sure that all your dependencies are installed in the virtual environment that you are using.\n\nTo run the crew, you can use the following command:\n\nIf you are unsure about the name of your crew, you can check the readme.md file that was generated by the CLI. It will contain detailed instructions on how to run your crew.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this tutorial, we created a team of AI agents that can generate a newsletter for us. We used CrewAI to orchestrate the agents and tasks, and we used the Exa API to search for the latest news on a given topic. We also learned how to define the tasks that our agents will need to complete, how to create the agents that will perform the tasks, and how to bind the tools to the agents. Finally, we learned how to put everything together and run the crew.",

      "# [The search startup trying to turn the web into a database by Will Douglas Heaven on 2024-12-03](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/03/1107726/the-startup-trying-to-turn-the-web-into-a-database/)\n“The web is a collection of data, but it’s a mess,\" says Exa cofounder and CEO Will Bryk. \"There's a Joe Rogan video over here, an Atlantic article over there. There's no organization. But the dream is for the web to feel like a database.”\n\nWebsets is aimed at power users who need to look for things that other search engines aren’t great at finding, such as types of people or companies. Ask it for “startups making futuristic hardware” and you get a list of specific companies hundreds long rather than hit-or-miss links to web pages that mention those terms. Google can’t do that, says Bryk: “There’s a lot of valuable use cases for investors or recruiters or really anyone who wants any sort of data set from the web.”\n\nThings have moved fast since MIT Technology Review broke the news in 2021 that Google researchers were exploring the use of large language models in a new kind of search engine. The idea soon attracted fierce critics. But tech companies took little notice. Three years on, giants like Google and Microsoft jostle with a raft of buzzy newcomers like Perplexity and OpenAI, which launched ChatGPT Search in October, for a piece of this hot new trend.\n\nExa isn’t (yet) trying to out-do any of those companies. Instead, it’s proposing something new. Most other search firms wrap large language models around existing search engines, using the models to analyze a user’s query and then summarize the results. But the search engines themselves haven’t changed much. Perplexity still directs its queries to Google Search or Bing, for example. Think of today’s AI search engines as a sandwich with fresh bread but stale filling.\n\nMore than keywords\n\nExa provides users with familiar lists of links but uses the tech behind large language models to reinvent how search itself is done. Here’s the basic idea: Google works by crawling the web and building a vast index of keywords that then get matched to users’ queries. Exa crawls the web and encodes the contents of web pages into a format known as embeddings, which can be processed by large language models.\n\nEmbeddings turn words into numbers in such a way that words with similar meanings become numbers with similar values. In effect, this lets Exa capture the meaning of text on web pages, not just the keywords.\n\nLarge language models use embeddings to predict the next words in a sentence. Exa’s search engine predicts the next link. Type “startups making futuristic hardware” and the model will come up with (real) links that might follow that phrase.\n\nExa’s approach comes at cost, however. Encoding pages rather than indexing keywords is slow and expensive. Exa has encoded some billion web pages, says Bryk. That’s tiny next to Google, which has indexed around a trillion. But Bryk doesn’t see this as a problem: “You don’t have to embed the whole web to be useful,” he says. (Fun fact: “exa” means a 1 followed by 18 0s and “googol” means a 1 followed by 100 0s.)\n\n“I find Exa most useful when I don't know exactly what I’m looking for,” says Andrew Gao, a computer science student at Stanford Univesrsity who has used the search engine. “For instance, the query ‘an interesting blog post on LLMs in finance’ works better on Exa than Perplexity.” But they’re good at different things, he says: “I use both for different purposes.”\n\n“I think embeddings are a great way to represent entities like real-world people, places, and things,” says Mike Tung, CEO of Diffbot, a company using knowledge graphs to build yet another kind of search engine. But he notes that you lose a lot of information if you try to embed whole sentences or pages of text: “Representing War and Peace as a single embedding would lose nearly all of the specific events that happened in that story, leaving just a general sense of its genre and period.”\n\nBryk acknowledges that Exa is a work in progress. He points to other limitations, too. Exa is not as good as rival search engines if you just want to look up a single piece of information, such as the name of Taylor Swift’s boyfriend or who Will Bryk is: “It’ll give a lot of Polish-sounding people, because my last name is Polish and embeddings are bad at matching exact keywords,” he says.\n\nFor now Exa gets around this by throwing keywords back into the mix when they’re needed. But Bryk is bullish: “We’re covering up the gaps in the embedding method until the embedding method gets so good that we don’t need to cover up the gaps.”",
      "# [Exa by Exa Labs](https://exa.ai/blog/scaling-our-highlights-server)\nServing real-time embeddings at scale is challenging. To launch Exa Highlights, we 4X’ed throughput by migrating from Python to Rust.\n\nHere’s how we did it and what we learned about LLM bottlenecks\n\nThe Problem Statement\n\nExa Highlights lets users extract chunks of content from any result’s webpage. In real time, we chunk and embed the full content of each result and find the top chunks. We wanted to optimize our throughput to serve production on one 8xA100 node.\n\n“We wanted to optimize our throughput to serve production on one 8xA100 node”\n\nHubert Yuan - on the objective of this project\n\nParallelize Parallelize Parallelize\n\nOur highlights pipeline involves both hefty CPU text pre-processing and GPU model inference. If we called these operations directly, the Python GIL would cause us to saturate at 1 CPU on a 128-CPU node, and our A100s would sit idle.\n\nHow we divide our work between CPUs and GPUs\n\nWe created dozens of processes serving each CPU-bound stage, connected with queues. The goal was firstly to offload work to other cores to unblock the GIL, and secondly to split and parallelize CPU tasks to reduce latency. We also split big inference jobs across GPUs.\n\nWatch your timing\n\nMeasurements are paramount when optimizing, but we ran into some tricky pitfalls. Here's the story:\n\nWe investigated GPU time spent on communication vs. computation and measured over half the time spent in communication. That didn't seem quite right.\n\nThe issue was that CUDA operations are async. Pytorch functions return instantly when possible, blocking only if computed values are needed. Adding torch.synchronize()before timing showed it was really compute-dominated. But our A100s weren't getting hot. How about the CPUs?\n\nOur A100s cluster running hot!\n\nAll the CPUs were working, which was a good sign, but they were far from maxed. Low utilization on both CPU and GPU pointed to a synchronous bottleneck. But where? The main process was just offloading tasks as fast as worker processes could complete them... right?\n\nThe issue was that the OS freely schedules the main Python process among CPUs, hiding GIL contention from view. As a quick hack to see the effect, we set the CPU affinity of the main process to 0, forcing it to the first CPU. Boom, instant 100%. GIL-blocked IPC was holding us up.\n\nJust write it in Rust\n\nWe made some progress optimizing IPC abstractions to take load off the main process. But finally we concluded we'd outgrown Python's parallelism model. Switching to Rust let us write cleaner code, working directly on the memory while staying safe.\n\nWithout needing to dance around the GIL, parallelism in Rust was dead simple: we wrote serial batched code, then replaced the serial iterator with a parallel one from rayon. We nested this in a thread for each request, and served our Torch model with tch-rs.\n\nParallelization on Rust is just one line\n\nWhat was our reward?\n\nWith the multiprocessing overheads removed, our throughput quadrupled. This was beyond expectation, since our previous CPU utilization was > 25%. So much of it was wasted on IPC! We celebrated a little, gave the new system a stress test, then...\n\nAfter migrating to Rust, parallelization works and throughput quadrupled\n\nCUDA out of memory error?! 😱\n\nOn an 80GB A100? We were sure that each GPU ran only one inference job at a time, and the biggest jobs took no more than 10GB of memory. A clue: attempted allocation was always less than available memory + reserved memory. Fragmentation?\n\nWe narrowed down the cause to using rayon's parallel iterators for data parallelism across separate GPUs. Making CUDA calls this way through Tch was not thread safe, and was interfering with timely tensor deallocation.\n\nLuckily, it turned out serial iterators worked just as well, due to async CUDA! We just had to refactor inference and bring results back to CPU into separate passes. This solved our thread count and OOM issues, and Highlights has been up to this day.\n\nThere’s much more we can do here, such as zero-allocation inference, quantization, cloud migration, etc.",
      "# [Exa raises $17M from Lightspeed, Nvidia, Y Combinator to build a Google for AIs by Julie Bort on 2024-07-16](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/16/exa-raises-17m-lightspeed-nvidia-ycombinator-google-ai-models/)\nWhile there’s no shortage of startups aiming to replace Google with AI-powered search (we’re looking at you, Perplexity), a startup called Exa has a different idea: a Google for AI.\n\nHumans aren’t the ones who desperately need a new kind of search engine, Exa’s founders believe. Rather, as AI increasingly takes hold in corporate and consumer life, it is the AI platforms themselves that must regularly venture out onto the internet to search for information and return bona fide answers, not hallucinations. And they can’t just type their requests on their keyboards.\n\nExa is building a tool that allows AI models to perform something like a web search, but with an AI-native twist.\n\nThe co-founders bought a million dollars’ worth of GPUs (which were easier to get in those days) and, using a vector database and embeddings (not a classic transformer-based LLM), they began to build a machine learning model trained to natively understand links rather than words and sentences.\n\n“Transformers normally predict the next word. We train our search engine to predict the next link,” CEO Will Bryk says. “So people share links on the web; we use that data as a dataset for our model that we train. And we train the model to predict the next link. So it’s a novel search algorithm.”\n\nSo just as an LLM would complete a sentence by furnishing the most probable next word, Exa’s system does so with the most probable link (or 10), but presumably minus the SEO spam and (ironically) AI-generated chum clogging every ordinary search engine these days.\n\nOn Monday the startup announced it raised a new $17 million Series A led by Lightspeed’s Guru Chahal, with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures and Y Combinator, it exclusively told TechCrunch. Exa has now raised a total of $22 million, including its previous $5 million seed. (Exa was in the summer 2021 YC cohort.)\n\n“This is a very ambitious vision,” says Chahal. “What Google is to humans, they are building for AI.”\n\nThe team was founded about a year before ChatGPT was launched, by two best friends who met their freshman year at Harvard: CEO Will Bryk (now 27) and co-founder Jeff Wang (26).\n\n“We launched before ChatGPT. Our initial goal as a company was not to serve AIs at all. It was: how do you use AI to build better search?” Wang said.\n\nAfter ChatGPT stormed the tech world, AI companies began asking Exa for an API version of their search engine that they could plug into their models. Exa is located in San Francisco, part of the cozy Cerebral Valley AI startup set. In fact, as TechCrunch previously reported, a tweet by Wang went viral when he was looking for other companies that wanted to go in on an order of office nap pods and the response was overwhelming. (The work-nap-repeat culture is alive and well in this part of the tech industry.)\n\nWith AI companies now as its primary customers, use cases for Exa’s search engine span everything from an AI chatbot looking up info on the internet while answering customers’ questions to companies looking to curate training data.\n\nDatabricks, for instance, is Exa’s marquee customer, using it to find large training sets for its own model training initiatives, the founders say.\n\nThe API version of the product was launched around a year ago. “Since then it’s gotten a crazy amount of traction,” Wang says. Today Exa says it’s serving thousands of developers — although it’s worth pointing out that Exa has a free tier that allows anyone to try its search engine in a limited way. It also has multiple tiered-fee levels. The founders wouldn’t reveal revenue except to say that they have some and the number is going up. (Interestingly, apart from running its own GPU-cluster, Exa hosts its product on AWS, not the AI-forward Google Cloud.)\n\nThe team isn’t particularly focused on being the search startup that upends Google. Although if AI becomes the be-all/end-all that the tech industry thinks it will be, search engines for AI bots could be the unexpected threat to the search hegemony.",
      "# [What is search engine tailored for AI: This startup raised $17M from NVIDIA and others to build it — TFN by Vivek Chhetri on 2024-07-17](https://techfundingnews.com/what-is-search-engine-tailored-for-ai-this-startup-raised-17m-from-nvidia-and-others-to-build-it/)\nExa, an AI research lab focused on search technology, has secured $22 million (previous $5 million seed) funding in total. This combined seed and Series A round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, with participation from NVentures (NVIDIA’s venture capital arm) and Y Combinator. The investment aims to accelerate Exa’s development of a search engine specifically designed for AI applications.\n\nJust yesterday, we also reported about how Huma closed a massive $80M funding and launched a Shopify-like AI digital health platform. It’s an interesting story too.\n\nWhy the need of search engine built for the age of AI\n\nExa argues that current search engines, like Google, prioritise clicks and user behaviour, making them unsuitable for the information needs of AI systems. “Soon, AI will search the web more than humans,” stated Exa CEO Will Bryk.\n\n“But search engines like Google were designed for humans, not AI.” Exa claims its technology addresses this gap by employing embedding models, similar to those used by large language models like ChatGPT. These models convert web pages into numerical representations, enabling Exa’s search engine to process vast amounts of information efficiently and identify the most relevant results for AI queries.\n\nExa highlights the limitations of keyword-based search engines. As an example, a Google search for “companies in SF building futuristic hardware” may return results optimised for search engine ranking rather than actual relevance. Exa, on the other hand, claims to deliver a list of companies that directly match the user’s intent.\n\nLightspeed Venture Partners, the lead investor, expressed enthusiasm for Exa’s approach. “Exa represents the intersection of an incredible team and a big vision for how AI applications will retrieve fresh knowledge,” said Guru Chahal, Partner at Lightspeed. He emphasised the critical role Exa could play in the AI ecosystem, alongside companies like NVIDIA and large language model developers, by providing the crucial data and knowledge layer.\n\nEarly traction and future plans\n\nExa reports that thousands of companies and developers have already integrated its technology. Applications range from AI writing assistants that source relevant research papers to venture capital firms searching for specific startups. The company also highlights its rapidly growing revenue, tripling in recent months.\n\nLooking towards the future, Exa’s ambitions extend beyond simply providing a search API. Co-founder Will Bryk emphasises the potential of AI to “truly organise the web’s knowledge,” creating opportunities for a wide range of applications.\n\nWhat we think about the new development\n\nExa’s approach represents a novel approach to search, specifically tailored for the information needs of AI systems. Whether Exa can successfully disrupt the established search engine landscape remains to be seen. However, the significant investment and early traction suggest that Exa’s technology has the potential to play a role in the evolving relationship between AI and information retrieval.",

      "# [Beating Google at Search with Neural PageRank and $5M of H200s — with Will Bryk of Exa.ai by Latent Space, swyx & Alessio on 2025-01-10](https://www.latent.space/p/exa)\nApplications close Monday for the NYC AI Engineer Summit focusing on AI Leadership and Agent Engineering! If you applied, invites should be rolling out shortly.\n\nThe search landscape is experiencing a fundamental shift. Google built a >$2T company with the “10 blue links” experience, driven by PageRank as the core innovation for ranking. This was a big improvement from the previous directory-based experiences of AltaVista and Yahoo. Almost 4 decades later, Google is now stuck in this links-based experience, especially from a business model perspective.\n\nThis legacy architecture creates fundamental constraints:\n\nMust return results in ~400 milliseconds\n\nRequired to maintain comprehensive web coverage\n\nTied to keyword-based matching algorithms\n\nCost structures optimized for traditional indexing\n\nAs we move from the era of links to the era of answers, the way search works is changing. You’re not showing a user links, but the goal is to provide context to an LLM. This means moving from keyword based search to more semantic understanding of the content:\n\nThe link prediction objective can be seen as like a neural PageRank because what you're doing is you're predicting the links people share... but it's more powerful than PageRank. It's strictly more powerful because people might refer to that Paul Graham fundraising essay in like a thousand different ways. And so our model learns all the different ways.\n\nAll of this is now powered by a $5M cluster with 144 H200s:\n\nThis architectural choice enables entirely new search capabilities:\n\nComprehensive result sets instead of approximations\n\nDeep semantic understanding of queries\n\nAbility to process complex, natural language requests\n\nAs search becomes more complex, time to results becomes a variable:\n\nPeople think of searches as like, oh, it takes 500 milliseconds because we've been conditioned... But what if searches can take like a minute or 10 minutes or a whole day, what can you then do?\n\nUnlike traditional search engines' fixed-cost indexing, Exa employs a hybrid approach:\n\nFront-loaded compute for indexing and embeddings\n\nVariable inference costs based on query complexity\n\nMix of owned infrastructure ($5M H200 cluster) and cloud resources\n\nExa sees a lot of competition from products like Perplexity and ChatGPT Search which layer AI on top of traditional search backends, but Exa is betting that true innovation requires rethinking search from the ground up. For example, the recently launched Websets, a way to turn searches into structured output in grid format, allowing you to create lists and databases out of web pages. The company raised a $17M Series A to build towards this mission, so keep an eye out for them in 2025.\n\nChapters\n\n00:00:00 Introductions\n\n00:01:12 ExaAI's initial pitch and concept\n\n00:02:33 Will's background at SpaceX and Zoox\n\n00:03:45 Evolution of ExaAI (formerly Metaphor Systems)\n\n00:05:38 Exa's link prediction technology\n\n00:09:20 Meaning of the name \"Exa\"\n\n00:10:36 ExaAI's new product launch and capabilities\n\n00:13:33 Compute budgets and variable compute products\n\n00:14:43 Websets as a B2B offering\n\n00:19:28 How do you build a search engine?\n\n00:22:43 What is Neural PageRank?\n\n00:27:58 Exa use cases\n\n00:35:00 Auto-prompting\n\n00:38:42 Building agentic search\n\n00:44:19 Is o1 on the path to AGI?\n\n00:49:59 Company culture and nap pods\n\n00:54:52 Economics of AI search and the future of search technology\n\nFull YouTube Transcript\n\nPlease like and subscribe!\n\nShow Notes\n\nExaAI\n\nWeb Search Product\n\nWebsets\n\nSeries A Announcement\n\nExa Nap Pods\n\nPerplexity AI\n\nCharacter.AI\n\nTranscript\n\nAlessio [00:00:00]: Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Latent Space podcast. This is Alessio, partner and CTO at Decibel Partners, and I'm joined by my co-host Swyx, founder of Smol.ai.\n\nSwyx [00:00:10]: Hey, and today we're in the studio with my good friend and former landlord, Will Bryk. Roommate. How you doing? Will, you're now CEO co-founder of ExaAI, used to be Metaphor Systems. What's your background, your story?\n\nWill [00:00:30]: Yeah, sure. So, yeah, I'm CEO of Exa. I've been doing it for three years. I guess I've always been interested in search, whether I knew it or not. Like, since I was a kid, I've always been interested in, like, high-quality information. And, like, you know, even in high school, wanted to improve the way we get information from news. And then in college, built a mini search engine. And then with Exa, like, you know, it's kind of like fulfilling the dream of actually being able to solve all the information needs I wanted as a kid. Yeah, I guess. I would say my entire life has kind of been rotating around this problem, which is pretty cool. Yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:00:50]: What'd you enter YC with?\n\nWill [00:00:53]: We entered YC with, uh, we are better than Google. Like, Google 2.0.\n\nSwyx [00:01:12]: What makes you say that? Like, that's so audacious to come out of the box with.\n\nWill [00:01:16]: Yeah, okay, so you have to remember the time. This was summer 2021. And, uh, GPT-3 had come out. Like, here was this magical thing that you could talk to, you could enter a whole paragraph, and it understands what you mean, understands the subtlety of your language. And then there was Google. Uh, which felt like it hadn't changed in a decade, uh, because it really hadn't. And it, like, you would give it a simple query, like, I don't know, uh, shirts without stripes, and it would give you a bunch of results for the shirts with stripes. And so, like, Google could barely understand you, and GBD3 could. And the theory was, what if you could make a search engine that actually understood you? What if you could apply the insights from LLMs to a search engine? And it's really been the same idea ever since. And we're actually a lot closer now, uh, to doing that. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:01:55]: Did you have any trouble making people believe? Obviously, there's the same element. I mean, YC overlap, was YC pretty AI forward, even 2021, or?\n\nWill [00:02:03]: It's nothing like it is today. But, um, uh, there were a few AI companies, but, uh, we were definitely, like, bold. And I think people, VCs generally like boldness, and we definitely had some AI background, and we had a working demo. So there was evidence that we could build something that was going to work. But yeah, I think, like, the fundamentals were there. I think people at the time were talking about how, you know, Google was failing in a lot of ways. And so there was a bit of conversation about it, but AI was not a big, big thing at the time. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:02:33]: Before we jump into Exa, any fun background stories? I know you interned at SpaceX, any Elon, uh, stories? I know you were at Zoox as well, you know, kind of like robotics at Harvard. Any stuff that you saw early that you thought was going to get solved that maybe it's not solved today?\n\nWill [00:02:48]: Oh yeah. I mean, lots of things like that. Like, uh, I never really learned how to drive because I believed Elon that self-driving cars would happen. It did happen. And I take them every night to get home. But it took like 10 more years than I thought. Do you still not know how to drive? I know how to drive now. I learned it like two years ago. That would have been great to like, just, you know, Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know? Um, I was obsessed with Elon. Yeah. I mean, I worked at SpaceX because I really just wanted to work at one of his companies. And I remember they had a rule, like interns cannot touch Elon. And, um, that rule actually influenced my actions.\n\nSwyx [00:03:18]: Is it, can Elon touch interns? Ooh, like physically?\n\nWill [00:03:22]: Or like talk? Physically, physically, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, interesting. He's changed a lot, but, um, I mean, his companies are amazing. Um,\n\nSwyx [00:03:28]: What if you beat him at Diablo 2, Diablo 4, you know, like, Ah, maybe.\n\nAlessio [00:03:34]: I want to jump into, I know there's a lot of backstory used to be called metaphor system. So, um, and it, you've always been kind of like a prominent company, maybe at least RAI circles in the NSF.\n\nSwyx [00:03:45]: I'm actually curious how Metaphor got its initial aura. You launched with like, very little. We launched very little. Like there was, there was this like big splash image of like, this is Aurora or something. Yeah. Right. And then I was like, okay, what this thing, like the vibes are good, but I don't know what it is. And I think, I think it was much more sort of maybe consumer facing than what you are today. Would you say that's true?\n\nWill [00:04:06]: No, it's always been about building a better search algorithm, like search, like, just like the vision has always been perfect search. And if you do that, uh, we will figure out the downstream use cases later. It started on this fundamental belief that you could have perfect search over the web and we could talk about what that means. And like the initial thing we released was really just like our first search engine, like trying to get it out there. Kind of like, you know, an open source. So when OpenAI released, uh, ChachBt, like they didn't, I don't know how, how much of a game plan they had. They kind of just wanted to get something out there.\n\nSwyx [00:04:33]: Spooky research preview.\n\nWill [00:04:34]: Yeah, exactly. And it kind of morphed from a research company to a product company at that point. And I think similarly for us, like we were research, we started as a research endeavor with a, you know, clear eyes that like, if we succeed, it will be a massive business to make out of it. And that's kind of basically what happened. I think there are actually a lot of parallels to, of w between Exa and OpenAI. I often say we're the OpenAI of search. Um, because. Because we're a research company, we're a research startup that does like fundamental research into, uh, making like AGI for search in a, in a way. Uh, and then we have all these like, uh, business products that come out of that.\n\nSwyx [00:05:08]: Interesting. I want to ask a little bit more about Metaforesight and then we can go full Exa. When I first met you, which was really funny, cause like literally I stayed in your house in a very historic, uh, Hayes, Hayes Valley place. You said you were building sort of like link prediction foundation model, and I think there's still a lot of foundation model work. I mean, within Exa today, but what does that even mean? I cannot be the only person confused by that because like there's a limited vocabulary or tokens you're telling me, like the tokens are the links or, you know, like it's not, it's not clear. Yeah.\n\nWill [00:05:38]: Uh, what we meant by link prediction is that you are literally predicting, like given some texts, you're predicting the links that follow. Yes. That refers to like, it's how we describe the training procedure, which is that we find links on the web. Uh, we take the text surrounding the link. And then we predict. Which link follows you, like, uh, you know, similar to transformers where, uh, you're trying to predict the next token here, you're trying to predict the next link. And so you kind of like hide the link from the transformer. So if someone writes, you know, imagine some article where someone says, Hey, check out this really cool aerospace startup. And they, they say spacex.com afterwards, uh, we hide the spacex.com and ask the model, like what link came next. And by doing that many, many times, you know, billions of times, you could actually build a search engine out of that because then, uh, at query time at search time. Uh, you type in, uh, a query that's like really cool aerospace startup and the model will then try to predict what are the most likely links. So there's a lot of analogs to transformers, but like to actually make this work, it does require like a different architecture than, but it's transformer inspired. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:06:41]: What's the design decision between doing that versus extracting the link and the description and then embedding the description and then using, um, yeah. What do you need to predict the URL versus like just describing, because you're kind of do a similar thing in a way. Right. It's kind of like based on this description, it was like the closest link for it. So one thing is like predicting the link. The other approach is like I extract the link and the description, and then based on the query, I searched the closest description to it more. Yeah.\n\nWill [00:07:09]: That, that, by the way, that is, that is the link refers here to a document. It's not, I think one confusing thing is it's not, you're not actually predicting the URL, the URL itself that would require like the, the system to have memorized URLs. You're actually like getting the actual document, a more accurate name could be document prediction. I see. This was the initial like base model that Exo was trained on, but we've moved beyond that similar to like how, you know, uh, to train a really good like language model, you might start with this like self-supervised objective of predicting the next token and then, uh, just from random stuff on the web. But then you, you want to, uh, add a bunch of like synthetic data and like supervised fine tuning, um, stuff like that to make it really like controllable and robust. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:07:48]: Yeah. We just have flow from Lindy and, uh, their Lindy started to like hallucinate recrolling YouTube links instead of like, uh, something. Yeah. Support guide. So. Oh, interesting. Yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:07:57]: So round about January, you announced your series A and renamed to Exo. I didn't like the name at the, at the initial, but it's grown on me. I liked metaphor, but apparently people can spell metaphor. What would you say are the major components of Exo today? Right? Like, I feel like it used to be very model heavy. Then at the AI engineer conference, Shreyas gave a really good talk on the vector database that you guys have. What are the other major moving parts of Exo? Okay.\n\nWill [00:08:23]: So Exo overall is a search engine. Yeah. We're trying to make it like a perfect search engine. And to do that, you have to build lots of, and we're doing it from scratch, right? So to do that, you have to build lots of different. The crawler. Yeah. You have to crawl a bunch of the web. First of all, you have to find the URLs to crawl. Uh, it's connected to the crawler, but yeah, you find URLs, you crawl those URLs. Then you have to process them with some, you know, it could be an embedding model. It could be something more complex, but you need to take, you know, or like, you know, in the past it was like a keyword inverted index. Like you would process all these documents you gather into some processed index, and then you have to serve that. Uh, you had high throughput at low latency. And so that, and that's like the vector database. And so it's like the crawling system, the AI processing system, and then the serving system. Those are all like, you know, teams of like hundreds, maybe thousands of people at Google. Um, but for us, it's like one or two people each typically, but yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:09:13]: Can you explain the meaning of, uh, Exo, just the story 10 to the 16th, uh, 18, 18.\n\nWill [00:09:20]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. So. Exo means 10 to the 18th, which is in stark contrast to. To Google, which is 10 to the hundredth. Uh, we actually have these like awesome shirts that are like 10th to 18th is greater than 10th to the hundredth. Yeah, it's great. And it's great because it's provocative. It's like every engineer in Silicon Valley is like, what? No, it's not true. Um, like, yeah. And, uh, and then you, you ask them, okay, what does it actually mean? And like the creative ones will, will recognize it. But yeah, I mean, 10 to the 18th is better than 10 to the hundredth when it comes to search, because with search, you want like the actual list of, of things that match what you're asking for. You don't want like the whole web. You want to basically with search filter, the, like everything that humanity has ever created to exactly what you want. And so the idea is like smaller is better there. You want like the best 10th to the 18th and not the 10th to the hundredth. I'm like, one way to say this is like, you know how Google often says at the top, uh, like, you know, 30 million results found. And it's like crazy. Cause you're looking for like the first startups in San Francisco that work on hardware or something. And like, they're not 30 million results like that. What you want is like 325 results found. And those are all the results. That's what you really want with search. And that's, that's our vision. It's like, it just gives you. Perfectly what you asked for.\n\nSwyx [00:10:24]: We're recording this ahead of your launch. Uh, we haven't released, we haven't figured out the, the, the name of the launch yet, but what is the product that you're launching? I guess now that we're coinciding this podcast with. Yeah.\n\nWill [00:10:36]: So we've basically developed the next version of Exa, which is the ability to get a near perfect list of results of whatever you want. And what that means is you can make a complex query now to Exa, for example, startups working on hardware in SF, and then just get a huge list of all the things that match. And, you know, our goal is if there are 325 startups that match that we find you all of them. And this is just like, there's just like a new experience that's never existed before. It's really like, I don't know how you would go about that right now with current tools and you can apply this same type of like technology to anything. Like, let's say you want, uh, you want to find all the blog posts that talk about Alessio's podcast, um, that have come out in the past year. That is 30 million results. Yeah. Right.\n\nWill [00:11:24]: But that, I mean, that would, I'm sure that would be extremely useful to you guys. And like, I don't really know how you would get that full comprehensive list.\n\nSwyx [00:11:29]: I just like, how do you, well, there's so many questions with regards to how do you know it's complete, right? Cause you're saying there's only 30 million, 325, whatever. And then how do you do the semantic understanding that it might take, right? So working in hardware, like I might not use the words hardware. I might use the words robotics. I might use the words wearables. I might use like whatever. Yes. So yeah, just tell us more. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sure.\n\nWill [00:11:53]: So one aspect of this, it's a little subjective. So like certainly providing, you know, at some point we'll provide parameters to the user to like, you know, some sort of threshold to like, uh, gauge like, okay, like this is a cutoff. Like, this is actually not what I mean, because sometimes it's subjective and there needs to be a feedback loop. Like, oh, like it might give you like a few examples and you say, yeah, exactly. And so like, you're, you're kind of like creating a classifier on the fly, but like, that's ultimately how you solve the problem. So the subject, there's a subjectivity problem and then there's a comprehensiveness problem. Those are two different problems. So. Yeah. So you have the comprehensiveness problem. What you basically have to do is you have to put more compute into the query, into the search until you get the full comprehensiveness. Yeah. And I think there's an interesting point here, which is that not all queries are made equal. Some queries just like this blog post one might require scanning, like scavenging, like throughout the whole web in a way that just, just simply requires more compute. You know, at some point there's some amount of compute where you will just be comprehensive. You could imagine, for example, running GPT-4 over the internet. You could imagine running GPT-4 over the entire web and saying like, is this a blog post about Alessio's podcast, like, is this a blog post about Alessio's podcast? And then that would work, right? It would take, you know, a year, maybe cost like a million dollars, but, or many more, but, um, it would work. Uh, the point is that like, given sufficient compute, you can solve the query. And so it's really a question of like, how comprehensive do you want it given your compute budget? I think it's very similar to O1, by the way. And one way of thinking about what we built is like O1 for search, uh, because O1 is all about like, you know, some, some, some questions require more compute than others, and we'll put as much compute into the question as we need to solve it. So similarly with our search, we will put as much compute into the query in order to get comprehensiveness. Yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:13:33]: Does that mean you have like some kind of compute budget that I can specify? Yes. Yes. Okay. And like, what are the upper and lower bounds?\n\nWill [00:13:42]: Yeah, there's something we're still figuring out. I think like, like everyone is a new paradigm of like variable compute products. Yeah. How do you specify the amount of compute? Like what happens when you. Run out? Do you just like, ah, do you, can you like keep going with it? Like, do you just put in more credits to get more, um, for some, like this can get complex at like the really large compute queries. And like, one thing we do is we give you a preview of what you're going to get, and then you could then spin up like a much larger job, uh, to get like way more results. But yes, there is some compute limit, um, at, at least right now. Yeah. People think of searches as like, oh, it takes 500 milliseconds because we've been conditioned, uh, to have search that takes 500 milliseconds. But like search engines like Google, right. No matter how complex your query to Google, it will take like, you know, roughly 400 milliseconds. But what if searches can take like a minute or 10 minutes or a whole day, what can you then do? And you can do very powerful things. Um, you know, you can imagine, you know, writing a search, going and get a cup of coffee, coming back and you have a perfect list. Like that's okay for a lot of use cases. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:14:43]: Yeah. I mean, the use case closest to me is venture capital, right? So, uh, no, I mean, eight years ago, I built one of the first like data driven sourcing platforms. So we were. You look at GitHub, Twitter, Product Hunt, all these things, look at interesting things, evaluate them. If you think about some jobs that people have, it's like literally just make a list. If you're like an analyst at a venture firm, your job is to make a list of interesting companies. And then you reach out to them. How do you think about being infrastructure versus like a product you could say, Hey, this is like a product to find companies. This is a product to find things versus like offering more as a blank canvas that people can build on top of. Oh, right. Right.\n\nWill [00:15:20]: Uh, we are. We are a search infrastructure company. So we want people to build, uh, on top of us, uh, build amazing products on top of us. But with this one, we try to build something that makes it really easy for users to just log in, put a few, you know, put some credits in and just get like amazing results right away and not have to wait to build some API integration. So we're kind of doing both. Uh, we, we want, we want people to integrate this into all their applications at the same time. We want to just make it really easy to use very similar again to open AI. Like they'll have, they have an API, but they also have. Like a ChatGPT interface so that you could, it's really easy to use, but you could also build it in your applications. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:15:56]: I'm still trying to wrap my head around a lot of the implications. So, so many businesses run on like information arbitrage, you know, like I know this thing that you don't, especially in investment and financial services. So yeah, now all of a sudden you have these tools for like, oh, actually everybody can get the same information at the same time, the same quality level as an API call. You know, it just kind of changes a lot of things. Yeah.\n\nWill [00:16:19]: I think, I think what we're grappling with here. What, what you're just thinking about is like, what is the world like if knowledge is kind of solved, if like any knowledge request you want is just like right there on your computer, it's kind of different from when intelligence is solved. There's like a good, I've written before about like a different super intelligence, super knowledge. Yeah. Like I think that the, the distinction between intelligence and knowledge is actually a pretty good one. They're definitely connected and related in all sorts of ways, but there is a distinction. You could have a world and we are going to have this world where you have like GP five level systems and beyond that could like answer any complex request. Um, unless it requires some. Like, if you say like, uh, you know, give me a list of all the PhDs in New York city who, I don't know, have thought about search before. And even though this, this super intelligence is going to be like, I can't find it on Google, right. Which is kind of crazy. Like we're literally going to have like super intelligences that are using Google. And so if Google can't find them information, there's nothing they could do. They can't find it. So, but if you also have a super knowledge system where it's like, you know, I'm calling this term super knowledge where you just get whatever knowledge you want, then you can pair with a super intelligence system. And then the super intelligence can, we'll never. Be blocked by lack of knowledge.\n\nAlessio [00:17:23]: Yeah. You told me this, uh, when we had lunch, I forget how it came out, but we were talking about AGI and whatnot. And you were like, even AGI is going to need search. Yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:17:32]: Yeah. Right. Yeah. Um, so we're actually referencing a blog post that you wrote super intelligence and super knowledge. Uh, so I would refer people to that. And this is actually a discussion we've had on the podcast a couple of times. Um, there's so much of model weights that are just memorizing facts. Some of the, some of those might be outdated. Some of them are incomplete or not. Yeah. So like you just need search. So I do wonder, like, is there a maximum language model size that will be the intelligence layer and then the rest is just search, right? Like maybe we should just always use search. And then that sort of workhorse model is just like, and it like, like, like one B or three B parameter model that just drives everything. Yes.\n\nWill [00:18:13]: I believe this is a much more optimal system to have a smaller LM. That's really just like an intelligence module. And it makes a call to a search. Tool that's way more efficient because if, okay, I mean the, the opposite of that would be like the LM is so big that can memorize the whole web. That would be like way, but you know, it's not practical at all. I don't, it's not possible to train that at least right now. And Carpathy has actually written about this, how like he could, he could see models moving more and more towards like intelligence modules using various tools. Yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:18:39]: So for listeners, that's the, that was him on the no priors podcast. And for us, we talked about this and the, on the Shin Yu and Harrison chase podcasts. I'm doing search in my head. I told you 30 million results. I forgot about our neural link integration. Self-hosted exit.\n\nWill [00:18:54]: Yeah. Yeah. No, I do see that that is a much more, much more efficient world. Yeah. I mean, you could also have GB four level systems calling search, but it's just because of the cost of inference. It's just better to have a very efficient search tool and a very efficient LM and they're built for different things. Yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:19:09]: I'm just kind of curious. Like it is still something so audacious that I don't want to elide, which is you're, you're, you're building a search engine. Where do you start? How do you, like, are there any reference papers or implementation? That would really influence your thinking, anything like that? Because I don't even know where to start apart from just crawl a bunch of shit, but there's gotta be more insight than that.\n\nWill [00:19:28]: I mean, yeah, there's more insight, but I'm always surprised by like, if you have a group of people who are really focused on solving a problem, um, with the tools today, like there's some in, in software, like there are all sorts of creative solutions that just haven't been thought of before, particularly in the information retrieval field. Yeah. I think a lot of the techniques are just very old, frankly. Like I know how Google and Bing work and. They're just not using new methods. There are all sorts of reasons for that. Like one, like Google has to be comprehensive over the web. So they're, and they have to return in 400 milliseconds. And those two things combined means they are kind of limit and it can't cost too much. They're kind of limited in, uh, what kinds of algorithms they could even deploy at scale. So they end up using like a limited keyword based algorithm. Also like Google was built in a time where like in, you know, in 1998, where we didn't have LMS, we didn't have embeddings. And so they never thought to build those things. And so now they have this like gigantic system that is built on old technology. Yeah. And so a lot of the information retrieval field we found just like thinks in terms of that framework. Yeah. Whereas we came in as like newcomers just thinking like, okay, there here's GB three. It's magical. Obviously we're going to build search that is using that technology. And we never even thought about using keywords really ever. Uh, like we were neural all the way we're building an end to end neural search engine. And just that whole framing just makes us ask different questions, like pursue different lines of work. And there's just a lot of low hanging fruit because no one else is thinking about it. We're just on the frontier of neural search. We just are, um, for, for at web scale, um, because there's just not a lot of people thinking that way about it.\n\nSwyx [00:20:57]: Yeah. Maybe let's spell this out since, uh, we're already on this topic, elephants in the room are Perplexity and SearchGPT. That's the, I think that it's all, it's no longer called SearchGPT. I think they call it ChatGPT Search. How would you contrast your approaches to them based on what we know of how they work and yeah, just any, anything in that, in that area? Yeah.\n\nWill [00:21:15]: So these systems, there are a few of them now, uh, they basically rely on like traditional search engines like Google or Bing, and then they combine them with like LLMs at the end to, you know, output some power graphics, uh, answering your question. So they like search GPT perplexity. I think they have their own crawlers. No. So there's this important distinction between like having your own search system and like having your own cache of the web. Like for example, so you could create, you could crawl a bunch of the web. Imagine you crawl a hundred billion URLs, and then you create a key value store of like mapping from URL to the document that is technically called an index, but it's not a search algorithm. So then to actually like, when you make a query to search GPT, for example, what is it actually doing it? Let's say it's, it's, it could, it's using the Bing API, uh, getting a list of results and then it could go, it has this cache of like all the contents of those results and then could like bring in the cache, like the index cache, but it's not actually like, it's not like they've built a search engine from scratch over, you know, hundreds of billions of pages. It's like, does that distinction clear? It's like, yeah, you could have like a mapping from URL to documents, but then rely on traditional search engines to actually get the list of results because it's a very hard problem to take. It's not hard. It's not hard to use DynamoDB and, and, and map URLs to documents. It's a very hard problem to take a hundred billion or more documents and given a query, like instantly get the list of results that match. That's a much harder problem that very few entities on, in, on the planet have done. Like there's Google, there's Bing, uh, you know, there's Yandex, but you know, there are not that many companies that are, that are crazy enough to actually build their search engine from scratch when you could just use traditional search APIs.\n\nAlessio [00:22:43]: So Google had PageRank as like the big thing. Is there a LLM equivalent or like any. Stuff that you're working on that you want to highlight?\n\nWill [00:22:51]: The link prediction objective can be seen as like a neural PageRank because what you're doing is you're predicting the links people share. And so if everyone is sharing some Paul Graham essay about fundraising, then like our model is more likely to predict it. So like inherent in our training objective is this, uh, a sense of like high canonicity and like high quality, but it's more powerful than PageRank. It's strictly more powerful because people might refer to that Paul Graham fundraising essay in like a thousand different ways. And so our model learns all the different ways. That someone refers that Paul Graham, I say, while also learning how important that Paul Graham essay is. Um, so it's like, it's like PageRank on steroids kind of thing. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:23:26]: I think to me, that's the most interesting thing about search today, like with Google and whatnot, it's like, it's mostly like domain authority. So like if you get back playing, like if you search any AI term, you get this like SEO slop websites with like a bunch of things in them. So this is interesting, but then how do you think about more timeless maybe content? So if you think about, yeah. You know, maybe the founder mode essay, right. It gets shared by like a lot of people, but then you might have a lot of other essays that are also good, but they just don't really get a lot of traction. Even though maybe the people that share them are high quality. How do you kind of solve that thing when you don't have the people authority, so to speak of who's sharing, whether or not they're worth kind of like bumping up? Yeah.\n\nWill [00:24:10]: I mean, you do have a lot of control over the training data, so you could like make sure that the training data contains like high quality sources so that, okay. Like if you, if you're. Training data, I mean, it's very similar to like language, language model training. Like if you train on like a bunch of crap, your prediction will be crap. Our model will match the training distribution is trained on. And so we could like, there are lots of ways to tweak the training data to refer to high quality content that we want. Yeah. I would say also this, like this slop that is returned by, by traditional search engines, like Google and Bing, you have the slop is then, uh, transferred into the, these LLMs in like a search GBT or, you know, our other systems like that. Like if slop comes in, slop will go out. And so, yeah, that's another answer to how we're different is like, we're not like traditional search engines. We want to give like the highest quality results and like have full control over whatever you want. If you don't want slop, you get that. And then if you put an LM on top of that, which our customers do, then you just get higher quality results or high quality output.\n\nAlessio [00:25:06]: And I use Excel search very often and it's very good. Especially.\n\nSwyx [00:25:09]: Wave uses it too.\n\nAlessio [00:25:10]: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like the slop is everywhere, especially when it comes to AI, when it comes to investment. When it comes to all of these things for like, it's valuable to be at the top. And this problem is only going to get worse because. Yeah, no, it's totally. What else is in the toolkit? So you have search API, you have ExaSearch, kind of like the web version. Now you have the list builder. I think you also have web scraping. Maybe just touch on that. Like, I guess maybe people, they want to search and then they want to scrape. Right. So is that kind of the use case that people have? Yeah.\n\nWill [00:25:41]: A lot of our customers, they don't just want, because they're building AI applications on top of Exa, they don't just want a list of URLs. They actually want. Like the full content, like cleans, parsed. Markdown. Markdown, maybe chunked, whatever they want, we'll give it to them. And so that's been like huge for customers. Just like getting the URLs and instantly getting the content for each URL is like, and you can do this for 10 or 100 or 1,000 URLs, wherever you want. That's very powerful.\n\nSwyx [00:26:05]: Yeah. I think this is the first thing I asked you for when I tried using Exa.\n\nWill [00:26:09]: Funny story is like when I built the first version of Exa, it's like, we just happened to store the content. Yes. Like the first 1,024 tokens. Because I just kind of like kept it because I thought of, you know, I don't know why. Really for debugging purposes. And so then when people started asking for content, it was actually pretty easy to serve it. But then, and then we did that, like Exa took off. So the computer's content was so useful. So that was kind of cool.\n\nSwyx [00:26:30]: It is. I would say there are other players like Gina, I think is in this space. Firecrawl is in this space. There's a bunch of scraper companies. And obviously scraper is just one part of your stack, but you might as well offer it since you already do it.\n\nWill [00:26:43]: Yeah, it makes sense. It's just easy to have an all-in-one solution. And like. We are, you know, building the best scraper in the world. So scraping is a hard problem and it's easy to get like, you know, a good scraper. It's very hard to get a great scraper and it's super hard to get a perfect scraper. So like, and, and scraping really matters to people. Do you have a perfect scraper? Not yet. Okay.\n\nSwyx [00:27:05]: The web is increasingly closing to the bots and the scrapers, Twitter, Reddit, Quora, Stack Overflow. I don't know what else. How are you dealing with that? How are you navigating those things? Like, you know. You know, opening your eyes, like just paying them money.\n\nWill [00:27:19]: Yeah, no, I mean, I think it definitely makes it harder for search engines. One response is just that there's so much value in the long tail of sites that are open. Okay. Um, and just like, even just searching over those well gets you most of the value. But I mean, there, there is definitely a lot of content that is increasingly not unavailable. And so you could get through that through data partnerships. The bigger we get as a company, the more, the easier it is to just like, uh, make partnerships. But I, I mean, I do see the world as like the future where the. The data, the, the data producers, the content creators will make partnerships with the entities that find that data.\n\nAlessio [00:27:53]: Any other fun use case that maybe people are not thinking about? Yeah.\n\nWill [00:27:58]: Oh, I mean, uh, there are so many customers. Yeah. What are people doing on AXA? Well, I think dating is a really interesting, uh, application of search that is completely underserved because there's a lot of profiles on the web and a lot of people who want to find love and that I'll use it. They give me. Like, you know, age boundaries, you know, education level location. Yeah. I mean, you want to, what, what do you want to do with data? You want to find like a partner who matches this education level, who like, you know, maybe has written about these types of topics before. Like if you could get a list of all the people like that, like, I think you will unblock a lot of people. I mean, there, I mean, I think this is a very Silicon Valley view of dating for sure. And I'm, I'm well aware of that, but it's just an interesting application of like, you know, I would love to meet like an intellectual partner, um, who like shares a lot of ideas. Yeah. Like if you could do that through better search and yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:28:48]: But what is it with Jeff? Jeff has already set me up with a few people. So like Jeff, I think it's my personal exit.\n\nWill [00:28:55]: my mom's actually a matchmaker and has got a lot of married. Yeah. No kidding. Yeah. Yeah. Search is built into the book. It's in your jeans. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:29:02]: Yeah. Other than dating, like I know you're having quite some success in colleges. I would just love to map out some more use cases so that our listeners can just use those examples to think about use cases for XR, right? Because it's such a general technology that it's hard to. Uh, really pin down, like, what should I use it for and what kind of products can I build with it?\n\nWill [00:29:20]: Yeah, sure. So, I mean, there are so many applications of XR and we have, you know, many, many companies using us for very diverse range of use cases, but I'll just highlight some interesting ones. Like one customer, a big customer is using us to, um, basically build like a, a writing assistant for students who want to write, uh, research papers. And basically like XR will search for, uh, like a list of research papers related to what the student is writing. And then this product has. Has like an LLM that like summarizes the papers to basically it's like a next word prediction, but in, uh, you know, prompted by like, you know, 20 research papers that X has returned. It's like literally just doing their homework for them. Yeah. Yeah. the key point is like, it's, it's, uh, you know, it's, it's, you know, research is, is a really hard thing to do and you need like high quality content as input.\n\nSwyx [00:30:08]: Oh, so we've had illicit on the podcast. I think it's pretty similar. Uh, they, they do focus pretty much on just, just research papers and, and that research. Basically, I think dating, uh, research, like I just wanted to like spell out more things, like just the big verticals.\n\nWill [00:30:23]: Yeah, yeah, no, I mean, there, there are so many use cases. So finance we talked about, yeah. I mean, one big vertical is just finding a list of companies, uh, so it's useful for VCs, like you said, who want to find like a list of competitors to a specific company they're investigating or just a list of companies in some field. Like, uh, there was one VC that told me that him and his team, like we're using XR for like eight hours straight. Like, like that. For many days on end, just like, like, uh, doing like lots of different queries of different types, like, oh, like all the companies in AI for law or, uh, all the companies for AI for, uh, construction and just like getting lists of things because you just can't find this information with, with traditional search engines. And then, you know, finding companies is also useful for, for selling. If you want to find, you know, like if we want to find a list of, uh, writing assistants to sell to, then we can just, we just use XR ourselves to find that is actually how we found a lot of our customers. Ooh, you can find your own customers using XR. Oh my God. I, in the spirit of. Uh, using XR to bolster XR, like recruiting is really helpful. It is really great use case of XR, um, because we can just get like a list of, you know, people who thought about search and just get like a long list and then, you know, reach out to those people.\n\nSwyx [00:31:29]: When you say thought about, are you, are you thinking LinkedIn, Twitter, or are you thinking just blogs?\n\nWill [00:31:33]: Or they've written, I mean, it's pretty general. So in that case, like ideally XR would return like the, the really blogs written by people who have just. So if I don't blog, I don't show up to XR, right? Like I have to blog. well, I mean, you could show up. That's like an incentive for people to blog.\n\nSwyx [00:31:47]: Well, if you've written about, uh, search in on Twitter and we, we do, we do index a bunch of tweets and then we, we should be able to service that. Yeah. Um, I mean, this is something I tell people, like you have to make yourself discoverable to the web, uh, you know, it's called learning in public, but like, it's even more imperative now because otherwise you don't exist at all.\n\nWill [00:32:07]: Yeah, no, no, this is a huge, uh, thing, which is like search engines completely influence. They have downstream effects. They influence the internet itself. They influence what people. Choose to create. And so Google, because they're a keyword based search engine, people like kind of like keyword stuff. Yeah. They're, they're, they're incentivized to create things that just match a lot of keywords, which is not very high quality. Uh, whereas XR is a search algorithm that, uh, optimizes for like high quality and actually like matching what you mean. And so people are incentivized to create content that is high quality, that like the create content that they know will be found by the right person. So like, you know, if I am a search researcher and I want to be found. By XR, I should blog about search and all the things I'm building because, because now we have a search engine like XR that's powerful enough to find them. And so the search engine will influence like the downstream internet in all sorts of amazing ways. Yeah. Uh, whatever the search engine optimizes for is what the internet looks like. Yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:33:01]: Are you familiar with the term? McLuhanism? No, it's not. Uh, it's this concept that, uh, like first we shape tools and then the tools shape us. Okay. Yeah. Uh, so there's like this reflexive connection between the things we search for and the things that get searched. Yes. So like once you change the tool. The tool that searches the, the, the things that get searched also change. Yes.\n\nWill [00:33:18]: I mean, there was a clear example of that with 30 years of Google. Yeah, exactly. Google has basically trained us to think of search and Google has Google is search like in people's heads. Right. It's one, uh, hard part about XR is like, uh, ripping people away from that notion of search and expanding their sense of what search could be. Because like when people think search, they think like a few keywords, or at least they used to, they think of a few keywords and that's it. They don't think to make these like really complex paragraph long requests for information and get a perfect list. ChatGPT was an interesting like thing that expanded people's understanding of search because you start using ChatGPT for a few hours and you go back to Google and you like paste in your code and Google just doesn't work and you're like, oh, wait, it, Google doesn't do work that way. So like ChatGPT expanded our understanding of what search can be. And I think XR is, uh, is part of that. We want to expand people's notion, like, Hey, you could actually get whatever you want. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:34:06]: I search on XR right now, people writing about learning in public. I was like, is it gonna come out with Alessio? Am I, am I there? You're not because. Bro. It's. So, no, it's, it's so about, because it thinks about learning, like in public, like public schools and like focuses more on that. You know, it's like how, when there are like these highly overlapping things, like this is like a good result based on the query, you know, but like, how do I get to Alessio? Right. So if you're like in these subcultures, I don't think this would work in Google well either, you know, but I, I don't know if you have any learnings.\n\nSwyx [00:34:40]: No, I'm the first result on Google.\n\nAlessio [00:34:42]: People writing about learning. In public, you're not first result anymore, I guess.\n\nSwyx [00:34:48]: Just type learning public in Google.\n\nAlessio [00:34:49]: Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But this is also like, this is in Google, it doesn't work either. That's what I'm saying. It's like how, when you have like a movement.\n\nWill [00:34:56]: There's confusion about the, like what you mean, like your intention is a little, uh. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:35:00]: It's like, yeah, I'm using, I'm using a term that like I didn't invent, but I'm kind of taking over, but like, they're just so much about that term already that it's hard to overcome. If that makes sense, because public schools is like, well, it's, it's hard to overcome.\n\nWill [00:35:14]: Public schools, you know, so there's the right solution to this, which is to specify more clearly what you mean. And I'm not expecting you to do that, but so the, the right interface to search is actually an LLM.\n\nSwyx [00:35:25]: Like you should be talking to an LLM about what you want and the LLM translates its knowledge of you or knowledge of what people usually mean into a query that excellent uses, which you have called auto prompts, right?\n\nWill [00:35:35]: Or, yeah, but it's like a very light version of that. And really it's just basically the right answer is it's the wrong interface and like very soon interface to search and really to everything will be LLM. And the LLM just has a full knowledge of you, right? So we're kind of building for that world. We're skating to where the puck is going to be. And so since we're moving to a world where like LLMs are interfaced to everything, you should build a search engine that can handle complex LLM queries, queries that come from LLMs. Because you're probably too lazy, I'm too lazy too, to write like a whole paragraph explaining, okay, this is what I mean by this word. But an LLM is not lazy. And so like the LLM will spit out like a paragraph or more explaining exactly what it wants. You need a search engine that can handle that. Traditional search engines like Google or Bing, they're actually... Designed for humans typing keywords. If you give a paragraph to Google or Bing, they just completely fail. And so Exa can handle paragraphs and we want to be able to handle it more and more until it's like perfect.\n\nAlessio [00:36:24]: What about opinions? Do you have lists? When you think about the list product, do you think about just finding entries? Do you think about ranking entries? I'll give you a dumb example. So on Lindy, I've been building the spot that every week gives me like the top fantasy football waiver pickups. But every website is like different opinions. I'm like, you should pick up. These five players, these five players. When you're making lists, do you want to be kind of like also ranking and like telling people what's best? Or like, are you mostly focused on just surfacing information?\n\nWill [00:36:56]: There's a really good distinction between filtering to like things that match your query and then ranking based on like what is like your preferences. And ranking is like filtering is objective. It's like, does this document match what you asked for? Whereas ranking is more subjective. It's like, what is the best? Well, it depends what you mean by best, right? So first, first table stakes is let's get the filtering into a perfect place where you actually like every document matches what you asked for. No surgeon can do that today. And then ranking, you know, there are all sorts of interesting ways to do that where like you've maybe for, you know, have the user like specify more clearly what they mean by best. You could do it. And if the user doesn't specify, you do your best, you do your best based on what people typically mean by best. But ideally, like the user can specify, oh, when I mean best, I actually mean ranked by the, you know, the number of people who visited that site. Let's say is, is one example ranking or, oh, what I mean by best, let's say you're listing companies. What I mean by best is like the ones that have, uh, you know, have the most employees or something like that. Like there are all sorts of ways to rank a list of results that are not captured by something as subjective as best. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:38:00]: I mean, it's like, who are the best NBA players in the history? It's like everybody has their own. Right.\n\nWill [00:38:06]: Right. But I mean, the, the, the search engine should definitely like, even if you don't specify it, it should do as good of a job as possible. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, totally. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a new topic to people because we're not used to a search engine that can handle like a very complex ranking system. Like you think to type in best basketball players and not something more specific because you know, that's the only thing Google could handle. But if Google could handle like, oh, basketball players ranked by like number of shots scored on average per game, then you would do that. But you know, they can't do that. So.\n\nSwyx [00:38:32]: Yeah. That's fascinating. So you haven't used the word agents, but you're kind of building a search agent. Do you believe that that is agentic in feature? Do you think that term is distracting?\n\nWill [00:38:42]: I think it's a good term. I do think everything will eventually become agentic. And so then the term will lose power, but yes, like what we're building is agentic it in a sense that it takes actions. It decides when to go deeper into something, it has a loop, right? It feels different from traditional search, which is like an algorithm, not an agent. Ours is a combination of an algorithm and an agent.\n\nSwyx [00:39:05]: I think my reflection from seeing this in the coding space where there's basically sort of classic. Framework for thinking about this stuff is the self-driving levels of autonomy, right? Level one to five, typically the level five ones all failed because there's full autonomy and we're not, we're not there yet. And people like control. People like to be in the loop. So the, the, the level ones was co-pilot first and now it's like cursor and whatever. So I feel like if it's too agentic, it's too magical, like, like a, like a one shot, I stick a, stick a paragraph into the text box and then it spits it back to me. It might feel like I'm too disconnected from the process and I don't trust it. As opposed to something where I'm more intimately involved with the research product. I see. So like, uh, wait, so the earlier versions are, so if trying to stick to the example of the basketball thing, like best basketball player, but instead of best, you, you actually get to customize it with like, whatever the metric is that you, you guys care about. Yeah. I'm still not a basketballer, but, uh, but, but, you know, like, like B people like to be in my, my thesis is that agents level five agents failed because people like to. To kind of have drive assist rather than full self-driving.\n\nWill [00:40:15]: I mean, a lot of this has to do with how good agents are. Like at some point, if agents for coding are better than humans at all tests and then humans block, yeah, we're not there yet.\n\nSwyx [00:40:25]: So like in a world where we're not there yet, what you're pitching us is like, you're, you're kind of saying you're going all the way there. Like I kind of, I think all one is also very full, full self-driving. You don't get to see the plan. You don't get to affect the plan yet. You just fire off a query and then it goes away for a couple of minutes and comes back. Right. Which is effectively what you're saying you're going to do too. And you think there's.\n\nWill [00:40:42]: There's a, there's an in-between. I saw. Okay. So in building this product, we're exploring new interfaces because what does it mean to kick off a search that goes and takes 10 minutes? Like, is that a good interface? Because what if the search is actually wrong or it's not exactly, exactly specified to what you mean, which is why you get previews. Yeah. You get previews. So it is iterative, but ultimately once you've specified exactly what you mean, then you kind of do just want to kick off a batch job. Right. So perhaps what you're getting at is like, uh, there's this barrier with agents where you have to like explain the full context of what you mean, and a lot of failure modes happen when you have, when you don't. Yeah. There's failure modes from the agent, just not being smart enough. And then there's failure modes from the agent, not understanding exactly what you mean. And there's a lot of context that is shared between humans that is like lost between like humans and, and this like new creature.\n\nAlessio [00:41:32]: Yeah. Yeah. Because people don't know what's going on. I mean, to me, the best example of like system prompts is like, why are you writing? You're a helpful assistant. Like. Of course you should be an awful, but people don't yet know, like, can I assume that, you know, that, you know, it's like, why did the, and now people write, oh, you're a very smart software engineer, but like, you never made, you never make mistakes. Like, were you going to try and make mistakes before? So I think people don't yet have an understanding, like with, with driving people know what good driving is. It's like, don't crash, stay within kind of like a certain speed range. It's like, follow the directions. It's like, I don't really have to explain all of those things. I hope. But with. AI and like models and like search, people are like, okay, what do you actually know? What are like your assumptions about how search, how you're going to do search? And like, can I trust it? You know, can I influence it? So I think that's kind of the, the middle ground, like before you go ahead and like do all the search, it's like, can I see how you're doing it? And then maybe help show your work kind of like, yeah, steer you. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nWill [00:42:32]: No, I mean, yeah. Sure. Saying, even if you've crafted a great system prompt, you want to be part of the process itself. Uh, because the system prompt doesn't, it doesn't capture everything. Right. So yeah. A system prompt is like, you get to choose the person you work with. It's like, oh, like I want, I want a software engineer who thinks this way about code. But then even once you've chosen that person, you can't just give them a high level command and they go do it perfectly. You have to be part of that process. So yeah, I agree.\n\nSwyx [00:42:58]: Just a side note for my system, my favorite system, prompt programming anecdote now is the Apple intelligence system prompt that someone, someone's a prompt injected it and seen it. And like the Apple. Intelligence has the words, like, please don't, don't hallucinate. And it's like, of course we don't want you to hallucinate. Right. Like, so it's exactly that, that what you're talking about, like we should train this behavior into the model, but somehow we still feel the need to inject into the prompt. And I still don't even think that we are very scientific about it. Like it, I think it's almost like cargo culting. Like we have this like magical, like turn around three times, throw salt over your shoulder before you do something. And like, it worked the last time. So let's just do it the same time now. And like, we do, there's no science to this.\n\nWill [00:43:35]: I do think a lot of these problems might be ironed out in future versions. Right. So, and like, they might, they might hide the details from you. So it's like, they actually, all of them have a system prompt. That's like, you are a helpful assistant. You don't actually have to include it, even though it might actually be the way they've implemented in the backend. It should be done in RLE AF.\n\nSwyx [00:43:52]: Okay. Uh, one question I was just kind of curious about this episode is I'm going to try to frame this in terms of this, the general AI search wars, you know, you're, you're one player in that, um, there's perplexity, chat, GPT, search, and Google, but there's also like the B2B side, uh, we had. Drew Houston from Dropbox on, and he's competing with Glean, who've, uh, we've also had DD from, from Glean on, is there an appetite for Exa for my company's documents?\n\nWill [00:44:19]: There is appetite, but I think we have to be disciplined, focused, disciplined. I mean, we're already taking on like perfect web search, which is a lot. Um, but I mean, ultimately we want to build a perfect search engine, which definitely for a lot of queries involves your, your personal information, your company's information. And so, yeah, I mean, the grandest vision of Exa is perfect search really over everything, every domain, you know, we're going to have an Exa satellite, uh, because, because satellites can gather information that, uh, is not available publicly. Uh, gotcha. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:44:51]: Can we talk about AGI? We never, we never talk about AGI, but you had, uh, this whole tweet about, oh, one being the biggest kind of like AI step function towards it. Why does it feel so important to you? I know there's kind of like always criticism and saying, Hey, it's not the smartest son is better. It's like, blah, blah, blah. What? You choose C. So you say, this is what Ilias see or Sam see what they will see.\n\nWill [00:45:13]: I've just, I've just, you know, been connecting the dots. I mean, this was the key thing that a bunch of labs were working on, which is like, can you create a reward signal? Can you teach yourself based on a reward signal? Whether you're, if you're trying to learn coding or math, if you could have one model say, uh, be a grading system that says like you have successfully solved this programming assessment and then one model, like be the generative system. That's like, here are a bunch of programming assessments. You could train on that. It's basically whenever you could create a reward signal for some task, you could just generate a bunch of tasks for yourself. See that like, oh, on two of these thousand, you did well. And then you just train on that data. It's basically like, I mean, creating your own data for yourself and like, you know, all the labs working on that opening, I built the most impressive product doing that. And it's just very, it's very easy now to see how that could like scale to just solving, like, like solving programming or solving mathematics, which sounds crazy, but everything about our world right now is crazy.\n\nAlessio [00:46:07]: Um, and so I think if you remove that whole, like, oh, that's impossible, and you just think really clearly about like, what's now possible with like what, what they've done with O1, it's easy to see how that scales. How do you think about older GPT models then? Should people still work on them? You know, if like, obviously they just had the new Haiku, like, is it even worth spending time, like making these models better versus just, you know, Sam talked about O2 at that day. So obviously they're, they're spending a lot of time in it, but then you have maybe. The GPU poor, which are still working on making Lama good. Uh, and then you have the follower labs that do not have an O1 like model out yet. Yeah.\n\nWill [00:46:47]: This kind of gets into like, uh, what will the ecosystem of, of models be like in the future? And is there room is, is everything just gonna be O1 like models? I think, well, I mean, there's definitely a question of like inference speed and if certain things like O1 takes a long time, because that's the thing. Well, I mean, O1 is, is two things. It's like one it's it's use it's bootstrapping itself. It's teaching itself. And so the base model is smarter. But then it also has this like inference time compute where it could like spend like many minutes or many hours thinking. And so even the base model, which is also fast, it doesn't have to take minutes. It could take is, is better, smarter. I believe all models will be trained with this paradigm. Like you'll want to train on the best data, but there will be many different size models from different, very many different like companies, I believe. Yeah. Because like, I don't, yeah, I mean, it's hard, hard to predict, but I don't think opening eye is going to dominate like every possible LLM for every possible. Use case. I think for a lot of things, like you just want the fastest model and that might not involve O1 methods at all.\n\nSwyx [00:47:42]: I would say if you were to take the exit being O1 for search, literally, you really need to prioritize search trajectories, like almost maybe paying a bunch of grad students to go research things. And then you kind of track what they search and what the sequence of searching is, because it seems like that is the gold mine here, like the chain of thought or the thinking trajectory. Yeah.\n\nWill [00:48:05]: When it comes to search, I've always been skeptical. I've always been skeptical of human labeled data. Okay. Yeah, please. We tried something at our company at Exa recently where me and a bunch of engineers on the team like labeled a bunch of queries and it was really hard. Like, you know, you have all these niche queries and you're looking at a bunch of results and you're trying to identify which is matched to query. It's talking about, you know, the intricacies of like some biological experiment or something. I have no idea. Like, I don't know what matches and what, what labelers like me tend to do is just match by keyword. I'm like, oh, I don't know. Oh, like this document matches a bunch of keywords, so it must be good. But then you're actually completely missing the meaning of the document. Whereas an LLM like GB4 is really good at labeling. And so I actually think like you just we get by, which we are right now doing using like LLMs as the labelers specifically for search. I think it's interesting. It's different between like search and like GB5 are different because GB5 might benefit from training on a lot of PhD notes because like GB5 might have to do like very, very complex, like, uh, problem-solving in after when it was given an input, but with search, it's actually a very different problem. You're, you're asking simple questions about billions of things. So like, whereas like GB5 is asking a really hard, it's like solving a really hard question, but it's one, it's like one question, a PhD level question with search. You're asking like simple questions about billions of things. Like, is this a startup? Did this person write a blog post about search? You know, those are actually simple questions. You don't need like PhD level training data. Does that make sense? Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:49:33]: What else we got here? Uh, nap pods. Oh, yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:49:38]: What's the, yeah. So like just generally, I think, uh, EXA has a very interesting company building vibe. Like you, you have a meme Lord CTO, um, I guess, I don't know. Like, and, and you, you have, you just generally, um, are counter consensus in a bunch of things. What is the culture at EXA?\n\nWill [00:49:59]: Like, yeah, I, me and Jeff are, I mean, we've been best friends. It's like, like we met, like met like first day of college. I've been best friends ever since. And we have a really good vibe. I think that's like intense, but also really fun. And like, like funny, honestly, we have a ton of like, we just laugh a lot, a ton at EXA. And I think that's just like, you see that in every part of our culture. We don't really care about how the world sees anything. Like me and Jeff are just like that. Like, we're just thinking really just like, like, what should we do here? Like, what do we need? And so in the nap pod case, it was like, people get tired a lot when they're coding or doing anything really. And like, why can't we just sleep here or, or like nap? And, uh, okay, if we need a nap, then we should get a nap pod. It's crazy to me that there aren't nap pods in lots of companies because like I get tired all the time. I take a nap like every other day, probably for like 20 minutes. I'm actually never actually napping. I'm just thinking about a problem, but closing my eyes really like, um, first of all, it makes me come up with more creative solutions. And then also actually it gives me some rest. So, which is awesome.\n\nSwyx [00:50:54]: Google was the original company that had the nap pods at work, right? Oh, okay.\n\nWill [00:50:56]: Well, then at one point Google was thinking for first principles and everything too. Um, and that was reflected in their nap pods.\n\nSwyx [00:51:02]: So you, you like, you like didn't just get a nap pod for your office. You like found something from China and you're like, who wants to get in on this? Let's get a container full of them. Yeah.\n\nWill [00:51:11]: Well, we're trying, we try to be frugal. So like we were, we were looking at like different nap pods. And then, uh, at some point we were like, wait, China probably has solved this problem. And so then we ordered it from China and then it was actually so heavy. Like when it came off the truck, it was like 500 pounds. And I like the truck was like having trouble, like putting it on the ground. And so like me and the delivery guy were like trying to hold it. And then we couldn't, we were struggling. So someone came out from on the street and like heart started helping us hurt yourself. I know it was really dangerous, but we did it. And then it was awesome.\n\nAlessio [00:51:37]: And it's funny. I was reading the tech crunch article about it. It was a tech crunch article on the nap pods. Yeah. And then Jeff explained, well, they quote Jeff and this paragraph says, so the nap pods maintain employees ability to stop work and sleep rather than the idea that in quotes, employees are slaves. Close quote, I don't know what I'm. I'm like, I'm sure there's not what event, you know, but I'm curious, like, just like how people there's always like this, I think for a little bit, it went away about like startups and kind of like hustle culture and like all of that.\n\nSwyx [00:52:10]: And I think now with AI, people are like, have all these feelings towards AI that are kind of like, I think it's a pro hustle culture, right? Yeah.\n\nWill [00:52:17]: But I mean, I mean, ideally the hustle is like people are just having fun, which is people, people are just having fun.\n\nAlessio [00:52:23]: Yeah. But I would say from the outside, it's like, people don't like it, you know, I'm saying people not in, in AI and kind of like intact. They're kind of like. Oh, these guys are at it again. These are like the same people that gave us underpaid drivers, like whatever it's like. So it was just funny to see somehow they wanted to make it sound like Jeff was saying employees are slaves, but like, oh, yeah, I don't know. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWill [00:52:45]: But yeah, I mean, okay. I can't imagine a more exciting experience than like building something from scratch. That's like a huge deal with a bunch of your friends. Our team is going to look back in 10 years and think this was like the most beautiful experience that you could have in life. And like. That's how I think about it. And yeah, that's just so it's not, it's not a hustle or not. It's like, is this like, like, does this satisfy your core desire to like build things in the world? And it does. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:53:10]: Anything else we didn't cover any parting thoughts? Are you hiring?\n\nWill [00:53:16]: Are you, obviously you're looking for more people to use it, but yeah, yeah, we're definitely hiring. We're, we're growing quite fast and we have a really smart team of engineers and researchers. And we now have a, we just purchased a $5 million H 200 cluster. So we have a lot more compute to play with. Do you run all your own inference? We do a mix of our cluster and like AWS inference that we, we use these are, so we have our current cluster, which is like a one hundreds and now we've updated the new one. We use it for training and research.\n\nSwyx [00:53:43]: What's the training versus inference budget? Like, is it like a, is it 50, 50? Is it?\n\nWill [00:53:48]: Yeah, we, there will be more inference for search for sure.\n\nSwyx [00:53:51]: The other thing I mentioned, so by the way, I'm like sidetracking, but I'm just kind of throwing this in there because I always think about the economics of AI search, like for those, I think, I think if you look up, there's the upper limit is going to be whatever you can monetize off of ads, right? So for Google, let's say it's like a one cent per thousand views, something like that. I don't know the exact number, the exact numbers floating around out there. That means that's your revenue, right? Then your cost has to be lower than that. And so at some point, like for an LLM inference call to be made for every page view, you need to get it lower than. The money that you would take in for, for that. And like, one of the things that I was very surprised, surprised for perplexity and character as well was that they couldn't get it so low that it would be reasonable. I think for you guys, it is a mix of front loading it by indexing. So you only run that compute like once a month, once a, once a quarter, whatever you do re-indexing. And then it's just a little bit more when you, when you do inference, when this search actually gets done, right? Like, so I think when people work out like the economics of such a business, they have to kind of think about where do you put the. The costs. Yes.\n\nWill [00:54:52]: Yes. I mean, uh, definitely you have to, you cannot run LLMs over the whole index, you know, billions of things at query time. So you have to pre-process things usually with LLMs, but then you, you can do a re-rank over like, you know, 10, 30, a hundred, depending on a thousand, depending on how. You know, you could, you could play with different sizes of L of transformers to get the cost to work out. I mean, one really interesting thing is like, we're building a search engine at a time where LLM costs are going down like crazy when some very useful. Tool goes down in cost by 200 X in like the space of, I don't know, a couple of years, there are going to be new opportunities in search, right? So like to, to not integrate this and build off, to not like rethink search from scratch, the search algorithm itself, given the fact that things are going down 200 X is crazy.\n\nAlessio [00:55:37]: Thank you so much for coming on, man. It was fun.",
      "# [EXA Infrastructure extends global managed fibre network by Joe O’Halloran on 2024-10-17](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366613801/EXA-Infrastructure-extends-global-managed-fibre-network)\nAfter a series of partnerships and extensions of its core transatlantic routes, critical backbone and digital platform provider EXA Infrastructure has announced the launch of its managed fibre network (MFN) service to address market demands for increased connectivity and shorter service delivery times.\n\nWith more than 20 years of experience in building resilient networks, EXA Infrastructure provides critical modern infrastructure and engineering expertise to serve as the backbone for digital and economic growth. This includes networks for governments and enterprises, hyperscale infrastructure for global businesses, and ultra-low latency, high bandwidth networks for financial, gaming and broadcast services.\n\nThe company owns 155,000km of fibre network across 37 countries, including six transatlantic cables, and claims the lowest latency link between Europe and North America, EXA Express. More than 65,000km of the network is 400G enabled, offering further scalability and ensuring ultra-low latency and high bandwidth connectivity across continents.\n\nFollowing the October 2023 introduction of the Havfrue and Dunant subsea cables, connecting to its European backbone, in January 2024, EXA announced its sixth transatlantic subsea cable route in the form of Amitié, linking the strategic hubs of Boston in the US, Slough in the UK and Bordeaux in France, where onward connectivity can be provided to anywhere on EXA’s owned network.\n\nThe dedicated MFN offering is said to be driven by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, content transmission and big data that mean networks need to scale to meet growing demands quickly. It’s designed to provide the benefit of dark fibre and equipment ownership, including what is claimed to be the highest levels of scalability at the lowest unit economics, without incurring the associated administration, technical and operational resourcing costs of in-house delivery.\n\nIn addition, EXA Infrastructure said the launch represents a turn-key solution that outsources the design, installation and maintenance of fibre networks for customers who do not possess these capabilities in-house or in-region, enabling companies to fill network gaps, connect datacentres and cable landing stations, and rapidly scale into markets quickly. The service is currently available in 29 European countries, plus the US and Canada.\n\n“EXA Infrastructure has managed networks for our customers for years, so this is our bread and butter,” said Steve Roberts, vice-president of strategic investments and product management at EXA Infrastructure. “Our extensive network, combined with extensive experience in managing different variations of subsea services for customers, means that our engineers and NOC staff are well poised to deliver best-in-breed service across our MFN customers. We are thrilled to launch our MFN offering today and look forward to continuing to support our customers to meet the never-ending demand for connectivity.”\n\nAs it was launching the MFN, EXA also announced the extension of its DWDM backbone into Finland. The new footprint will connect Helsinki to Stockholm, enhancing the company’s coverage in the Nordics and extending its direct presence to 37 countries across Europe and North America.\n\nThis strategic expansion aims to provide broader service offerings to EXA’s existing customer base – including 400G and Spectrum – while fostering competition in the local market. The company said the growth was being driven, in part, by the deployment of AI technologies, as Finland boasts the largest concentration of deployed datacentre capacity in the Nordics, nearing 240MW, with the majority located in Helsinki.",
      "# [3 AI search engines you can use instead of Google by Jacob Siegal, Chris Smith, José Adorno, Maren Estrada, Andy Meek, Joshua Hawkins on 2024-03-26](https://bgr.com/tech/3-ai-search-engines-you-can-use-instead-of-google/)\nWhile Google remains the world’s most popular search engine, the arrival of generative artificial intelligence has opened the door to some intriguing rivals. If you’re looking for a specific answer to a question rather than a list of links, generative AI can be preferable to run-of-the-mill search engines. We’ve discussed some of those alternatives in the past, but below, we’ve rounded up three AI-powered search engines you should try out.\n\n1. Perplexity AI\n\nOne of the most impressive AI search engines currently available is Perplexity. We have written extensively about Perplexity in the past, and as my colleague Andy Meek wrote back in January, it is “respectful of both the users it serves and the content it surfaces.”\n\nFirst and foremost, Perplexity is easy to use. When you visit the website, you will see a mostly blank page with a search box in the center. Click on the search box, and a selection of notable, newsworthy topics will pop up as suggestions. Choose one of the suggestions or type in your own question and click the arrow button to ask the chatbot a question.\n\nPerplexity will then provide an answer alongside a list of sources it used, related searches, and any relevant maps, pictures, and videos on the right side of the page.\n\nYou can also create an account to save your threads and you can upgrade to Perplexity Pro for access to more powerful AI models, image generation, and more detailed answers.\n\n2. You.com\n\nAnother popular AI search engine is You.com, which describes itself as “a private search engine without privacy-invading ads that you can customize with 150+ apps.” At a glance, the site looks very similar to Perplexity, but there are a few key differences. Most notably, a three-dot menu at the bottom of the page offers a host of useful options, from turning on private mode to changing your region to modifying the recency of your search results.\n\nIf the chatbot can’t find what you need, You.com also contains a more traditional search engine with links to other websites, image results, videos, news, and maps.\n\n3. Exa\n\nEarlier this year, the team behind Metaphor renamed its AI-powered search engine Exa. As the team explained in a blog post, “Exa’s goal is to understand any query – no matter how complex – and filter the internet to exactly the knowledge required for that query.”\n\nFor instance, when I search for the most popular restaurants in New York City on Google, I see a few suggestions at the top of the page and then countless listicles in the search results.\n\nThe same search on Exa simply offers a long list of popular restaurants with direct links to their websites. As useful as a blog can be with detailed reviews and interesting context, sometimes I just want an answer to my question. That’s what Exa does best.",
      "# [15 Best Perplexity AI Alternatives (2024) by Anthony Cardillo on 2024-07-16](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/perplexity-alternatives)\nPerplexity AI has quickly become one of the most popular AI tools. But unlike standard chatbots, it functions a bit differently in order to cater to researchers, students, and enterprise users who need real-time information.\n\nUsers also have access to extensive features and many of the top AI models. But despite this, it’s not necessarily the best tool for everybody because of its limitations when it comes to content creation and creativity.\n\nInstead, it functions more like a conversational AI search engine for information retrieval.\n\nWith that in mind, we’ve compiled a list of the 15 best Perplexity AI alternatives worth considering.\n\nPlatformBest ForPricingBrave Leo AIIncreased user privacy and security$14.99 per monthGoogle GeminiIntegrating AI with Google Suite products$19.99 per monthClaudeUnderstanding natural human languageStarts at $20 per monthChatGPTGenerating faster, more accurate responses$20 per monthMicrosoft CopilotReal-time access to Internet information$20 per monthPiHuman-like personal assistant supportFreePoeAccessing numerous chatbots in one place$19.99 per monthYouChatSummarizing web pages and documents$20 per monthKomoSearching niche community conversationsStarts at $8 per monthAndiConcise and to-the-point web searchesFreePhindAnswering technical coding questions and queries$20 per monthiAskFinding fast, factual answers$9.95 per monthYepAd-free conversational search resultsFreeTextCortexCustomizable AI writing assistant with real-time web accessStarts at $5.59 per monthExaAI web search with API access for complex queriesStarts at $50 per month\n\n1. Brave Leo AI\n\nBrave Leo AI Overview\n\nLanguage model: Mixtral 8x7B, Claude Instant, and Llama 2 13B\n\nConnected to the internet: Yes\n\nPurpose: Privacy first AI assistant for web browsing, research, and content creation\n\nDate launched: November 2, 2023\n\nCreated by: Brave Software\n\nBrave Leo is an integrated artificial intelligence assistant built directly into the Brave web browser. It’s like the privacy-focused version of Perplexity AI because users can choose between various LLMs (Mixtral 8x7B, Claude Instant, and Llama 2 13B) to perform multimodal tasks like text, image, audio, or video content processing.\n\nBrave's entire business model as a web browser is built on privacy. The same is true for Leo AI. The tool does not retain chats and no user information is ever used for model training or user identification.\n\nHowever, Leo is only available for Brave browser users. It’s deeply integrated and gives users direct access to Leo’s features from the address bar or sidebar while visiting a web page to analyze text, ask for a translation, or get quick answers to content-related questions.\n\nBrave Leo AI Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nDoes not record chats to maintain user privacy and security\n\nQuickly summarizes web pages, PDFs, Google Docs, and other documents without leaving the page\n\nCan create new content, including articles, essays, emails, and code suggestions\n\nAvailable for both text and voice-to-text interactions\n\nCons\n\nNot nearly as advanced in continuous learning and natural language comprehension as other AI assistants\n\nBrave Leo AI Pricing\n\nLeo is free forever for all Brave browser users. However, usage limits apply, and you may see slower response times during peak usage hours. Leo Premium is available with an initial 7-day free trial and $14.99 per month. Premium members can switch between LLMs with higher rate limits.\n\n2. Gemini\n\nGemini Overview\n\nLanguage model: Proprietary family of Gemini models (Ultra, Pro, Flash, and Nano)\n\nConnected to the internet: Yes\n\nPurpose: AI-powered Google Suite assistant for research and content creation\n\nDate launched: March 21, 2023\n\nCreated by: Google DeepMind\n\nGoogle's Gemini is the refined and rebranded update to Bard. Google’s AI model and chatbot was developed as an alternative to compete with ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, it operates a lot like Perplexity AI because of its multimodal capabilities and real-time search functionality through Google’s search engine.\n\nDespite the improvements to Gemini, it still produces more hallucinations than Perplexity. But for creating content, it surpasses Perplexity with human-like content and a customizable writing style that Perplexity has yet to reach.\n\nThe model’s latest release, Gemini 1.5 Pro, offers a massive 1,000,000 token context length, while Perplexity is more limited to around 30,000 tokens.\n\nGemini Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nIntegrates with Google search to access real-time information.\n\nProvides instant and accurate translations across 35 different languages.\n\nMultimodal capabilities for processing text, images, audio, and video.\n\nKnown for its advanced reasoning and complex problem-solving capabilities.\n\nCons\n\nUsers need a Google account to sign up.\n\nLacks creativity in content creation that other alternatives can provide.\n\nGemini Pricing\n\nGemini is free for all users, but an upgrade is required to unlock Gemini Advanced. For $19.99/month, you can create a Google One account to get full Gemini Advanced access, 2TB of cloud storage, and other benefits like Gemini, available directly in Gmail, Docs, and other Google apps.\n\n3. Claude\n\nClaude Overview\n\nLanguage model: Proprietary (Claude 3 Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus)\n\nConnected to the internet: No\n\nPurpose: Advanced natural language chatbot assistant\n\nDate launched: March 2023\n\nCreated by: Anthropic\n\nFor those who prefer a more versatile alternative to Perplexity, Claude is a solid choice because of the tool's advanced reasoning capabilities and a strong focus on AI safety. Claude is also a more creative chatbot for content creation with a large context window of up to 100,000 tokens.\n\nWhile Claude is not connected to the internet because of Anthropic’s focus on AI safety, it's trained on the most recent data (with a cutoff date of April 2024). This makes Claude less valuable for research purposes, but it’s preferred for creative tasks because of the tool’s grasp of context and nuance.\n\nIn June 2024, Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Sonnet. This is the first of the Claude 3.5 model family (with more to come) and ranks as the company’s highest-performing model. Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperforms Claude 3, GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Gemini 1.5 in many notable benchmark categories.\n\nClaude Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nEmphasizes AI safety to provide users with helpful, harmless, and honest information\n\nAccess to the full suite of Claude models, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n\nProvides the best understanding of natural language, primarily in technical domains\n\nCons\n\nNo internet connection to pull real-time information\n\nClaude Pricing\n\nA limited version of Claude is free for users who want basic access to the tool through the web or iOS app. This also grants access to Claude 3 Sonnet. However, to unlock more features like Claude 3 Opus and Haiku, higher usage limits, project creation, and early access to new features, a Pro ($20 per month) or Team ($30 per month) membership is required.\n\n4. ChatGPT\n\nChatGPT Overview\n\nLanguage model: GPT‑4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5\n\nConnected to the internet: Yes\n\nPurpose: Conversational AI assistant for advanced tasks and content generation\n\nDate launched: November 30, 2022\n\nCreated by: OpenAI\n\nSearch engine-reliant tools like Gemini and Perplexity AI are great for research but need to improve in other areas, like advanced language understanding and generative AI content creation. That’s where ChatGPT, the most popular AI tool in the space, comes in handy.\n\nWith this versatile AI chatbot, it's also easier to start and hold longer human-like conversations. Users have a 128,000 token context window for text inputs while getting new access to improved multilingual, audio, and vision capabilities.\n\nA ChatGPT subscription allows users to switch between the GPT‑4o, GPT-4, and GPT-3.5 models. However, you'll need a Plus membership to unlock real-time information retrieval and web browsing with ChatGPT. Otherwise, the tool falls well short of Perplexity AI when it comes to web research.\n\nChatGPT Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nTrained on a large knowledge base between 570 GB and 45 TB of text\n\nAbility to create and use Custom GPTs from the GPT store\n\nSupports over 50 languages for content creation and translations\n\nAvailable as a mobile app and browser extension for easy access\n\nCons\n\nFree users can only access an outdated knowledge base with no real-time web browsing\n\nChatGPT Pricing\n\nChatGPT is free forever for basic users. This tier includes full GPT-3.5 access and limited GPT-4 and GPT-4o access. During peak usage times, free users will experience slower response times.\n\nMeanwhile, Pro users unlock full access to all GPT models with 5x the GPT-4o capacity for only $20 per month. ChatGPT Team is $30 per user each month with higher messaging limits and admin console access if you work with other team members.\n\n5. Microsoft Copilot\n\nMicrosoft Copilot Overview\n\nLanguage model: GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo\n\nConnected to the internet: Yes\n\nPurpose: AI-driven productivity assistant for Microsoft users\n\nDate launched: February 22, 2023\n\nCreated by: Microsoft\n\nMuch like Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot caters to researchers who want information with citations and references. Copilot is also completely free to use and easily integrates with Microsoft 365 applications and services like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams.\n\nFormerly known as Bing Chat, Copilot can access real-time information through Bing search results. With each query, Copilot includes sources for claims, accurate data, and statistics (when relevant).\n\nDespite the advanced content generation capabilities, Copilot really stands out in enhancing users’ workplace productivity and creativity. The enterprise features are currently more equipped to help larger organizations collaborate, too.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nMakes it easy to automate repetitive tasks like drafting emails and generating reports\n\nIntegrates with Microsoft 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams) to optimize workflow\n\nQuery responses include citations with direct links to sources\n\nProvides context-aware suggestions with continuous learning\n\nCons\n\nMore prone to hallucinations than other alternatives with direct internet access\n\nMicrosoft Copilot Pricing\n\nMicrosoft Copilot is free to use in a web browser, but upgrading to Copilot Pro unlocks added features. For $20 per user per month, Copilot Pro offers access to Copilot in Microsoft 365 apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote.\n\nYou unlock extra features like image creation with Designer and priority access to GPT-4 Turbo. Copilot is available for commercial customers at $30 per user per month. The increased pricing includes added enterprise-grade security, privacy, and compliance.\n\n6. Pi\n\nPi Overview\n\nLanguage model: Inflection-1\n\nConnected to the internet: Yes\n\nPurpose: Personalized AI companion for emotional support and conversation\n\nDate launched: May 2, 2023\n\nCreated by: Inflection AI\n\nDeveloped by Inflection AI, Pi is a personal AI chatbot assistant capable of providing personal and genuine responses during conversations. It combines factual information with emotional intelligence to make it feel like a more personalized AI tool.\n\nPi is more than a typical chatbot and qualifies itself as a neutral interlocutor AI agent that uses continual learning to improve a user's experience. All conversations with Pi are natural and meaningful, skipping over the generic responses many tools are prone to providing.\n\nSince Pi integrates real-time web search capabilities, it can offer similar features as Perplexity. But because Pi focuses more on empathetic and supportive interactions, it’s best to view it as more of a creative partner or coach rather than a thorough research tool like Perplexity AI.\n\nPi Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nCompletely free to use with no limit restrictions\n\nProvides empathetic responses and displays human-like emotional support\n\nAdapts to an individual user's conversational style\n\nUses previous chats to provide personalized query responses\n\nCons\n\nLimited knowledge base and lacks advanced content creation capabilities\n\nPi Pricing\n\nPi is still considered to be in the initial launch phase, so Inflection has made the tool completely free to use. Currently, no premium pricing plans or upgrades are available, but that could change as Pi and Inflection AI evolve.\n\n7. ​​Poe\n\nPoe Overview\n\nLanguage model: Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5, GPT-4o, etc.\n\nConnected to the internet: Yes\n\nPurpose: To democratize AI and give users access to the widest range of chatbots\n\nDate launched: February 6, 2023\n\nCreated by: Quora\n\nPoe (Platform for Open Exploration) is an AI chatbot platform developed by Quora. Like Perplexity, users can choose the popular AI models they want to use (ChatGPT, GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, etc.) and even create custom chatbots on the platform.\n\nIts primary function is to aggregate multiple AI models. While Perplexity offers a similar capability, Poe is built for more general AI interactions, such as casual conversations, basic problem-solving, and content creation.\n\nQuora is planning to make the platform a place where creators can thrive, too. The Creator Monetization program allows you to create and launch a chatbot on Poe and get paid per subscriber and per message.\n\nPoe Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nOffers numerous AI models like GPT-4, Claude, PaLM, and more in one platform\n\nCustom chatbot creation without coding\n\nDoes not show ads or track previous user search history of clicks\n\nConnects to the internet and provides up-to-date information\n\nCons\n\nLimited messaging for free users\n\nHigher rate of false information and hallucinations\n\nPoe Pricing\n\nPoe is free to use forever for customers who only need basic functionality, low daily messaging limits, and a limited selection of AI bots and models. You can upgrade to a premium plan for $19.99 per month or $199.99 per year to unlock all models and chatbots, increase daily limits, and gain priority access and support.\n\n8. YouChat\n\nYouChat Overview\n\nLanguage model: Proprietary in-house model and other existing LLMs\n\nConnected to the internet: Yes\n\nPurpose: AI-driven content creation and web search assistant\n\nDate launched: December 2023, 2022\n\nCreated by: You.com\n\nLike Perplexity AI, YouChat is a ChatGPT-style search engine with conversational AI capabilities and real-time web access. It also directly integrates with You.com's AI-powered content creation tools suite, such as YouWrite, YouImagine, and Code Complete.\n\nUsers can also switch between different modes (Smart, GPT-4o, Research, Creative, etc.) to determine the type of output they'll generate. Plus, the platform has an Explore page to see the latest news, generate AI summaries of published articles, and ask follow-up questions about the topic.\n\nSome of the research YouChat provides needs to catch up to the depth Perplexity can offer, but pairing YouChat with their other tools can really improve productivity and creativity.\n\nYouChat Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nUses Google search to provide sources and citations with generated answers\n\nReal-time learning capabilities\n\nProvides up-to-date information\n\nProtects user information and never shares customer data\n\nCons\n\nSubscription required to access most advanced AI models\n\nResearch can be clunky with too many contradicting sources or citations\n\nYouChat Pricing\n\nYouChat is free to use, but YouPro provides more features, such as full access to premium AI models (GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, etc.), unlimited queries, and greater accuracy. Users can upgrade for $20 per month (or $180 billed annually).\n\n9. Komo\n\nKomo Overview\n\nLanguage model: Sunshine (Komo's proprietary LLM)\n\nConnected to the internet: Yes\n\nPurpose: Personalized AI search with added privacy and community insights\n\nDate launched: August 29, 2022\n\nCreated by: Komo\n\nKomo is a free AI search engine that offers a private, fast, and ad-free search experience. Users can easily search the web, see the latest news, and generate content. Like Perplexity, you can also perform deep dive searches on specific topics by adjusting the search type and asking follow-up questions.\n\nStudents and academics conducting research, businesses looking for data-driven insights, and anyone needing efficient information retrieval will find Komo's search function to be highly advanced with added privacy features.\n\nUsers can refine the responses they'll receive from a query by selecting from the Ask, Search, Research, and Explore tabs. It’s completely free to use to start.\n\nKomo Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nProvides quick, accurate, and relevant search results\n\nAble to summarize and bookmark web content\n\nExplore feature scans social media to see what the community says about a topic\n\nCan be used for content creation, translation, summarization, and question\n\nCons\n\nThe user interface is clunky for new customers\n\nKomo Pricing\n\nWhile Komo is free to use, it has many limitations. Upgrading to a paid plan is preferred for extensive use. The Basic pricing plan starts at $8 per month, which includes unlimited search with Komo’s proprietary ‘Sunshine’ model and up to 30 research mode queries per day.\n\nMore active users will benefit from the $15 per month Premium plan. This tier includes up to 300 daily research mode queries and centralized access to GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini models.\n\n10. Andi\n\nAndi Overview\n\nLanguage model: Proprietary\n\nConnected to the internet: Yes\n\nPurpose: Generate quick topic-related web summaries from search engine sources\n\nDate launched: December 2021\n\nCreated by: LazyWeb Inc.\n\nAndi is a search engine that combines generative AI, live data integration, and semantic search technology to create a conversational search experience. After submitting a question or query, Andi generates a list of links to web pages that contain related information.\n\nThe more visual, card-style interface is less in-depth but more user-friendly than Perplexity. From there, users can visit the page, quickly read about the topic, or ask Andi to summarize and explain it. If you don’t like the results, try refining the search to generate results from DuckDuckGo or Brave instead.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to dial in the search results to go deep into a specific topic. Andi also maintains user privacy well by eliminating ads and not tracking user search history or clicks. Right away, users will notice a huge difference in user experience compared to Perplexity AI.\n\nAndi Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nProvides direct links to sources from Google, DuckDuckGo, etc. with AI summaries\n\nOffers a completely ad-free search experience\n\nProvides up-to-date and context-aware responses\n\nCons\n\nLacks advanced features and content generation capabilities\n\nLimited personalization\n\nAndi Pricing\n\nRight now, all Andi features are completely free. There are no premium membership tiers available.\n\n11. Phind\n\nPhind Overview\n\nLanguage model: Proprietary Phind models (Instant and 70B)\n\nConnected to the internet: Yes\n\nPurpose: Offer quick answers and code suggestions to developers and programmers\n\nDate launched: February 21, 2023\n\nCreated by: Phind\n\nPhind is an AI answer engine built for developers and programmers. The tool is primarily used to solve challenging programming problems by generating query answers, code examples, and responses with generative AI.\n\nUsers can choose from a list of AI models they want to use when generating query or question responses (Phind Instant, Phind-70B, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, etc.). It’s specialized for programming, with developer environment integrations and a 32k token context window to support longer, more detailed conversations.\n\nIf you’re a developer who needs somewhere to go to get quick answers, Phind offers a little more than Perplexity AI can. This includes a Playground feature similar to OpenAI’s Playground to test different models and Code Mode, a side-by-side coding chatbot.\n\nPhind Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nProvides accurate and contextual programming question responses\n\nCan handle advanced coding tasks like running Python snippets in your browser\n\nProvides sources with links for all coding suggestions and answer replies\n\nCons\n\nNot useful for more general searches or research outside of coding\n\nPhind Pricing\n\nPhind is free to use but with limitations. Phind Pro is available for $20 per month and includes unlimited Phind-70B searches, multi-query search mode, an extended 32k context window, and more access to advanced AI models like Claude and GPT-4o.\n\n12. iAsk\n\niAsk Overview\n\nLanguage model: Property (iAsk Pro)\n\nConnected to the internet: Yes\n\nPurpose: To generate fast AI responses to natural language queries\n\nDate launched: January 1, 2022\n\nCreated by: Ai Search Inc.\n\niAsk is a free AI search engine that allows users to use natural language to generate instant, accurate, and factual answers to their questions. It's built on a fine-tuned large-scale Transformer language-based model that outperformed all current LLM models.\n\niAsk acts more like a traditional search engine like Microsoft Copilot, while Perplexity is more reliable for chat-based information retrieval and research. However, iAsk does allow users to adjust their desired query response length and filter sources by category (Question, Academic, Wiki, etc.).\n\nPremium users unlock a suite of features that make iAsk even more impressive. These include the ability to ask follow-up questions, document uploading, image generation, and more.\n\niAsk Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nPro model ranks as the best among all available LLMs according to benchmarks\n\nOffers additional content summarization and image creation features\n\nVersatile tool for research with real-time web search access\n\nCons\n\nMay struggle with complex queries or nuanced contexts\n\niAsk Pricing\n\nWhile iAsk is free to use, this tier includes ads and no access to Pro questions. To unlock more features, you’ll need to upgrade to iAsk Pro. This tier is available for $9.95 per month and includes 300 daily Pro questions, Advanced Self-Reasoning AI capabilities, no ads, and much more.\n\n13. Yep\n\nYep Overview\n\nLanguage model: Proprietary\n\nConnected to the internet: Yes\n\nPurpose: Google alternative with built-in AI chatbot capabilities for quick responses\n\nDate launched: June 2022\n\nCreated by: Ahrefs\n\nYep is a privacy-focused, revenue-sharing search engine developed by Ahrefs. The search engine itself functions a lot like Google, but it has limited AI features. But built into the platform is Yep Chat, a conversational AI assistant that can understand text prompts and generate replies with real-time web information.\n\nAhrefs has incorporated content and link signals, as well as NLP and BERT models, to create Yep. This allows the search engine to produce relevant and helpful search results for users with continuous updates and indexing.\n\nYep has also created an ad revenue-sharing model for content creators. For more in-depth research, Perplexity wins. However, for users who want a more diverse search experience, Yep can offer something different.\n\nYep Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nEmphasizes privacy by not collecting any user personal information\n\nOffers a 90% ad revenue share program to reward content creators\n\nIndexes search results every 15-30 minutes to offer the most up-to-date information\n\nYep Chat can scan the web for research and content creation\n\nCons\n\nLimited generative AI content capabilities while Yep Chat is in beta\n\nSearch results quality lags behind other competitors, especially for news queries\n\nYep Pricing\n\nSince Yep is mainly still in beta, it's completely free to use with no monthly memberships available.\n\n14. TextCortex\n\nTextCortex Overview\n\nLanguage model: Zeno (Proprietary)\n\nConnected to the internet: Yes\n\nPurpose: Generative AI copilot for internet browsing, research, and content creation\n\nDate launched: July 2021\n\nCreated by: Text Cortex AI\n\nTextCortex is an AI-powered writing assistant with various features, such as ZenoChat, Zeno Assist, and the TextCortex Toolbar, to help with content creation, web research, and more. With so many different features, TextCortex operates like a true AI copilot that integrates seamlessly into your workflow.\n\nCreativity is a strong point for TextCortex as it allows users to create new personas for content generation. This feature tailors content to match brand voice or writing style by generating output based on a preset tone of voice.\n\nWith access to real-time web browsing and knowledge collaboration, users can connect multiple data sources like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive. For larger teams who rely on AI to perform research and create SEO-optimized content, TextCortex is a better option than Perplexity AI.\n\nTextCortex Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nProduces high-quality, SEO-optimized content from customizable prompts\n\nSupports over 25 languages for content writing\n\nAllows users to create personalized personas for more creative content generation\n\nAvailable as a browser extension to connect with popular apps like Google Docs\n\nCons\n\nPricing can be steep for high-use individuals compared to alternative options\n\nTextCortex Pricing\n\nFor all of its advanced content generation features, TextCortex is quite affordable and even offers a limited free plan with 20 daily creations included. For more access, premium plans start as low as $5.59/month per 150 creations.\n\nThe most popular premium plan is $23.99 monthly, including 1,000 creations and 300 MB of storage. Custom plans are available for enterprise users.\n\n15. Exa\n\nExa Overview\n\nLanguage model: Proprietary\n\nConnected to the internet: Yes\n\nPurpose: Precise AI research assistant with real-time information and data\n\nDate launched: January 2021\n\nCreated by: Exa AI\n\nSimilar to Perplexity AI, Exa is an advanced AI-powered search engine that can understand user intent and deliver contextually relevant search results. Primarily, Exa is used for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), deep research, and training datasets.\n\nBecause Exa can conduct complex, research-based searches and find highly relevant resources based on user queries, it has been described as the “AI Librarian for the Web.”\n\nThe company's AI model is a novel link prediction transformer that goes beyond standard keyword matching like Google does with SEO content.\n\nUsers can filter searches based on content category (company, blog post, news, etc.) and publish date to retrieve more refined results. They also offer an API for companies and developers to integrate live web data into their AI applications.\n\nExa Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nEasily interprets and breaks down complex queries to generate precise results\n\nOffers interactive, live chat capabilities where users can ask follow-up questions\n\nProvides access to the latest information from the web to avoid hallucinations\n\nAPI access for businesses and developers\n\nCons\n\nLacks content creation and creative writing capabilities\n\nInformation accuracy is a step behind Perplexity AI\n\nExa Pricing\n\nFree users get up to 10 results per search and 1,000 total monthly requests for the Exa search engine. As you use the tool more, upgrades are required to match desired search amounts.
