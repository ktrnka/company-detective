      "# [Knowledge vs. Intelligence by Exa Labs](https://exa.ai/blog/superknowledge)\nThe most important technical problem\n\nIlya Sutskever thinks \"building safe superintelligence is the most important technical problem of our​​ time\".\n\nI disagree. I think there’s a more pressing technical problem, one that needs to be solved first – superknowledge.\n\nThe world is far shorter on knowledge than intelligence right now. We’ll soon have near-AGI intelligences (GPT-5) relying on knowledge systems built for humans in the late 1900s (Google).\n\nThis is an absurd situation, even a dangerous one.\n\nWe need to build superknowledge before superintelligence. Let’s explore why.\n\nIntelligence is bottlenecked by knowledge\n\nIntelligence is different from knowledge.\n\nIntelligence is reasoning over an input. Knowledge is retrieving from a data repository.\n\nAll the recent advanced AI models have high intelligence, but surprisingly limited knowledge.\n\nFor example, GPT-4 can nail any highschool physics problem, but if you ask it to retrieve a list of physics PhDs in NYC – a relatively simpler request – you get this:\n\nGPT-4 does have some knowledge of the world, but it isn’t anywhere close to knowing everything -- every phd webpage, every news article, blog post, youtube video, tweet, reddit post, meme, etc.\n\nThat's why LLMs are often combined with a search engine. The LLM brings the intelligence, and the search engine brings the knowledge. At least, in theory. Unfortunately today’s search engines can't handle simple knowledge requests either:\n\nKnowledge systems like Google haven't improved much over the past decade (arguably, they’ve gotten worse). In contrast, intelligence systems improve every month.\n\nThat means intelligence is increasingly bottlenecked by knowledge.\n\nLuckily, we now have technology like transformers, which enable radically new knowledge systems. That's what our team at Exa is working on. I believe we're only a few years away from building superknowledge.\n\nWhat is superknowledge?\n\nSuperintelligence is a system that can handle extremely complex reasoning requests.\n\nSuperknowledge is a system that can handle extremely complex retrieval requests.\n\nWe've achieved superknowledge when there exists an API that can handle any knowledge request over available information, no matter how complex.\n\nSuperknowledge would handle requests like:\n\n\"all physics PhDs in NYC\" (should return all 457 physics PhDs in NYC and any associated metadata)\n\n\"The org chart of every AI startup in the Bay Area started in the past 3 years sorted by employee count, where the founders have some experience training LLMs in pytorch\" (should return a perfect comprehensive list)\n\n\"All the apartments in SF that have a window facing a courtyard and air conditioning and don't have any reviews about smell complaints, sorted by price\" (if you happen to be superknowledgeable about this one plz DM me)\n\nIn short, superknowledge gives everyone comprehensive knowledge of anything as quickly as they want.\n\nI believe we urgently need this comprehensive knowledge, both to progress society and to safeguard it.\n\nSuperknowledge unblocks progress\n\nIf you want to accelerate human progress, superknowledge is perhaps the most overlooked way to do it.\n\nProgress is a constant cycle of learning what's out there and trying something new. Superknowledge eliminates any bottlenecks to the first step so that all energy can be focused on the second.\n\nDoctors would get a deep analysis of all previous studies involving similar symptoms before making their diagnosis\n\nAI researchers would instantly gather every experimental result related to any new idea they think up\n\nSoftware engineers would find every C++ project containing the code snippets they need\n\nJournalists would in real time see every fact that supports or negates what their interviewee states\n\nInvestors would never miss a climate tech opportunity that fits their portfolio\n\nArtists would find every modern painter in Denver who they should meet when they travel there\n\nSupply chain managers would identify the best possible supplier for every stage of the rocket assembly pipeline\n\nSuperknowledge would make us all superproductive and superinformed.\n\nIn our personal lives, much of our time is wasted searching -- for apartments, events, clothing, interesting articles, solutions to personal problems, etc. Superknowledge gathers all information for you in 2 seconds, not 2 days.\n\nSometimes we even waste not days, but months or years of our lives because we didn’t learn something existed until later – the perfect job opportunity, the right medical treatment. With superknowledge, you’d have a smart alert system so that you're fully in the know about any topic. No more \"I wish I knew that earlier\", for anything.\n\nProgress will accelerate most from combining superknowledge with an intelligence like GPT-5. GPT-5 can handle the planning and processing while superknowledge handles the retrieval.\n\nLet’s say you want help finishing a research paper. GPT-5 + superknowledge would take each paragraph in your paper and find all the similar ideas from across the web (papers, blog posts, tweets, videos, etc). Then it would find the counterarguments to each of those ideas. Then the counterarguments to the counterarguments, and so on. It would feel as if a week-long academic conference had analyzed your paper, but in 2 seconds.\n\nOn the other hand, GPT-5 + Google would get stuck because Google can’t handle queries like finding similar ideas or counterarguments.\n\nIt’s difficult for us to fathom how quickly progress will accelerate when every intelligence – whether human or AI – is unblocked by all the knowledge that’s out there.\n\nSuperknowledge prepares us for superintelligence\n\nSuperknowledge doesn’t just accelerate us toward an advanced future, it also accelerates us toward a safer one.\n\nWhen people list the biggest threats to humanity, they don’t usually put the state of our knowledge as the top threat, but it actually is.\n\nThat’s because our knowledge underlies everything in our society – what problems we care about, how we act toward others, which politicians we choose, etc. Every societal malfunction is downstream from bad knowledge.\n\nUnfortunately, our current knowledge ecosystem is a mess. Knowledge is scattered across billions of webpages with no tool powerful enough to organize it all. That makes it extremely hard to become truly well-informed on any issue – you never know what knowledge you’re missing.\n\nWhen people aren’t well-informed, they make the wrong decisions, elect the wrong leaders, and cause inefficiencies throughout society. This is causing real problems, from inane housing laws to actual war.\n\nThe rise of agentic AI systems multiplies this problem dramatically. If AIs are stuck with the same knowledge tools as humans, then we’ll just have thousands more intelligences operating over the same incomplete knowledge. These AIs will interact with billions of people daily and perform actions on their behalf. They will be highly intelligent but misinformed, a dangerous combination.\n\nOur society deserves something better. Building superknowledge is the solution.\n\nSuperknowledge advances safety because it lets people or AIs quickly become well-informed on any topic – from the technologies related to carbon removal to the laws that should govern AI itself. I’d much rather take advice from an AI that analyzed the 10,000 relevant arguments on the web over one that read the first 10 links of a Google search.\n\nWe're now entering the most volatile decade in human history. It’s essential that humans and AIs can rely on a mature knowledge ecosystem that guides us through the chaos.\n\nWe just better build it before superintelligence arrives.\n\nWe're building superknowledge\n\nIt’s no accident that the Bible begins with a story about the tree of knowledge. For 5,000 years, humans have dreamed of knowing everything. We’re going to achieve that dream in about 3 years, and I think it’ll be powered by Exa. This is a historic mission, biblical even.\n\nI’ve personally dreamt of knowing everything for two decades, since I was a little kid lying prone on my 4-foot tall outer-space book wondering what it all means. We're finally almost there.\n\nIt's interesting that no-one else is working on this. While there are dozens of labs working on superintelligence, as far as I'm aware there's only one organization in the world working on superknowledge – Exa.\n\nThat’s partly because building superknowledge requires an organization with the right incentives. Organizations with ad-based revenue models will not build it. Exa, in contrast, has a usage-based revenue model. We’re highly incentivized to give users full control to retrieve whatever knowledge they need. Turns out users would pay a lot for superknowledge.\n\nAnother reason no one's building superknowledge is that it’s hard. We need to design novel ML architectures in a novel research field while building a novel search business. That’s not including all the massive infrastructure required for crawling, storing, processing, and serving petabytes of web data.\n\nYet superknowledge seems more attainable than superintelligence. It requires fewer magical breakthroughs. We have a pretty clear roadmap to get there.\n\nThe clock is ticking. To safely navigate the next decade, we need to build superknowledge before SSI, OpenAI, or some other organization builds superintelligence. For the Exa team, this is the most important technical problem of our time.",

It's absolutely not faster (yet, we're working on it) than those services if latency is your biggest concern. But its cheaper, and the reranking and chunking is also parametrically done by an agent, as opposed to the static params (that we suspect) they're using. \n\nfeel free to check it out: [https://critiquebrowser.app/en/flow-api](https://critiquebrowser.app/en/flow-api)\n\nit supports structured output parsing, so if you want in-line citation style responses, you can use the search api as is, but if you want structured output, you can specify a JSON schema and it'll return that to you.

I don't think o3 level reasoners have a real moat beyond:\n\n1. Enough (inference level) compute to make it commercially viable, which I'm almost certain OAI is struggling with\n2. Enough training compute, especially for coherent long context reasoning chains (I'm also skeptical here)\n3. A good enough meta-RL setup to boostrap itself to generate better synthetic data for the next loop\n\nNone of these are real moats. #1 - #2 are a matter of money and chip architecture. #3 is well known and any ole lab with enough money can easily replicate the work if OAI succeeds. Hell, when I was at G, #3 was already considered back in 2021 (back when we called everything scratchpad reasoners), but folks prioritized other low hanging fruits first. I still don't think enough low hanging fruits have been picked off, and given the compute figures coming out of OAI, I'm starting to think they're being squeezed into a tough spot if they're going all in on this already.\n\nSo this is why I think it's hype - because it's an old idea that is easily replicable. If OAI does it and it proves viable, every lab will very quickly (in O(weeks)) follow suit. The only thing that differentiates them is if consumers think that theirs is more special than the wagonload that will follow (that is already following). The way to do that is to hype and market.\n\n#### Comment ID m8cqw4e with +1 score by [(windsostrange, Reddit, 2025-01-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1i6dpet/ceo_of_exa_with_inside_information_about_open_ai/m8cqw4e/) (in reply to ID m8bhk71):\nDid you even read the comment you're replying to?

Which means it will still not be capable to do any real world tasks reliably.\n\nHowever, I expect very rapid development.\n\n#### Comment ID m8ilaqf with +1 score by [(Altruistic-Skill8667, Reddit, 2025-01-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1i6dpet/ceo_of_exa_with_inside_information_about_open_ai/m8ilaqf/) (in reply to ID m8il6t5):\nWhich other post?\n\n## Comment ID m8blz1k with +6 score by [(_OVERHATE_, Reddit, 2025-01-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1i6dpet/ceo_of_exa_with_inside_information_about_open_ai/m8blz1k/) (in reply to ID 1i6dpet):\nHow can i profit from this?\n\n## Comment ID m8bzgyf with +4 score by [(smoke121gr, Reddit, 2025-01-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1i6dpet/ceo_of_exa_with_inside_information_about_open_ai/m8bzgyf/) (in reply to ID 1i6dpet):\nI call bs on this.\n\n## Comment ID m8e3bqk with +2 score by [(cantthinkofausrnme, Reddit, 2025-01-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1i6dpet/ceo_of_exa_with_inside_information_about_open_ai/m8e3bqk/) (in reply to ID 1i6dpet):\nIt's just advertising..\n\n## Comment ID m8e60qq with +2 score by [(jeromymanuel, Reddit, 2025-01-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1i6dpet/ceo_of_exa_with_inside_information_about_open_ai/m8e60qq/) (in reply to ID 1i6dpet):\nThis is the worst flow of screenshotting I’ve seen.

To not accept this is to ignore a huge amount of recent evidence. And you have to consider the insane rate of improvement, not just the current capabilities of current models. I've been talking to people who build these models for years, and there has been a stark change in their opinions recently. RL combined with transformers is a genuine breakthrough, one that labs were trying to make for years and now finally have.\n\nA good thought experiment -- try to come up with a task that humans can do on the computer today that you're very confident these systems in 1 year won't be able to do.\n\nIf you struggle to do that, that should tell you something. \n\nI am not claiming in the post that these models are AGI by end of year, just that we have basically all the techniques to get there pretty straightforwardly. I'm also not claiming these models will be able to drive a car or build a house this year (though I do take a self-driving car home every night and humanoid robots are advancing rapidly, so...)\n\n  \nIf this crazy tech happens in 3 years vs 1 year, is one reasonable and the other hype? What matters is that it's going to happen soon and it's going to radically change our species. We should start taking these things seriously as a species now.\n\n### Comment ID m8ibaiu with +1 score by [(phdyle, Reddit, 2025-01-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1i6dpet/ceo_of_exa_with_inside_information_about_open_ai/m8ibaiu/) (in reply to ID m8h7puq):\nThe silly part of your argument is where you indicate that the path to AGI is “a clear shot” that is.. somehow independent of the definition of AGI. \n\nI will just let it sit.\n\n## Comment ID m8h8721 with +2 score by [(Specialist_Cheek_539, Reddit, 2025-01-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1i6dpet/ceo_of_exa_with_inside_information_about_open_ai/m8h8721/) (in reply to ID 1i6dpet):\nWow this sub.

It’s not because I believe a random twitter hype post. More because I am seeing how model performance is reacting to the test-time scaling reasoning and it really does seem like the last domino to fall before we have useful agents that can stay on task and solve novel problems that require both vast knowledge and reasoning.\n\nI think as humans, we are going to have an incredibly difficult time accepting that these capabilities exist. They challenge our view of our own place in the universe.\n\nI feel like there’s one final domain where we see basically zero progress, humor. AI cannot crack a decent joke. I think that’s probably because it is non-sentient. The unexpected litmus test for subjectivity is the ability to laugh and if an entity can’t laugh, it can’t create a funny joke. Intelligence appears to be a separate capability that does not require sentience and we will have incredibly powerful non-sentient AGIs that, in principle, are tools because as long as we align them, they have cannot be said to have a motive.\n\nI think this is a best case scenario, incredible power and possibility, but under human control.

      "# Post ID 1dr0sq9: Are startup AI search engines going to kill the internet as we know it?  with +0 score by [(hotgirlintech, Reddit, 2024-06-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1dr0sq9/are_startup_ai_search_engines_going_to_kill_the/)\nI've been thinking a lot about AI search engines lately and how they might change the internet. As someone who spends way too much time online (don't we all?), I'm both curious and worried about what this means for the web we know and love.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\n* These AI search engines like Perplexity are pretty impressive. They can give you quick answers without having to dig through a bunch of SEO-stuffed websites.\n* It's kind of amazing how they can understand and summarize complex topics.\n\nThe concerning stuff:\n\n* What happens to all the bloggers, journalists, and content creators who rely on web traffic?\n* There are some serious copyright issues when AIs just grab and repackage other people's work.\n* I worry about ending up in an AI echo chamber where we lose the diversity of voices that make the internet great.\n\nBut I don't think it's all doom and gloom. I believe there's a way for AI search to enhance the internet rather than replace it. Here's what I think a \"good\" AI search engine could look like:\n\n1. Always really highlight the original sources and make it easy to visit the full articles - I don't mean just a tiny footnote or cut off source box\n2. Find a way to promote and compensate original content creators\n3. Focus on discovering new, high-quality content rather than just recycling the same top results\n4. Give users tools to fact-check and contribute their own knowledge\n\nThere is no one search engine that does all of these things well. While I like Perplexity (despite the wrong answers), I'm really uncomfortable with how their AI Pages feature is straight up SEO spam. Publishers like Forbes and Wired have accused it of plagiarism, and the sources are totally buried. They've started showing up in Google results for me. That seems bad. You .com looked promising early-on but has lost its way with the answers getting worse. Google's AI Overviews are just awful.\n\nI like the idea of open source alternatives like Simplicity or the self-hosted Developers Digest, but they don't fix these problems per se, although you could roll your own version at least.\n\nI've always liked the little indie search engines Andi and Exa (which was called Metaphor before), even if they're a little obscure. Andi promotes original website creators really well (almost like a visual Instagram feed) and often surprises me with oddball or unusual stuff, but often you have ask it to \"write about\" something before it gives an AI answer. I like Exa for finding interesting and unexpected pages.\n\nAm I alone caring about this, or are other people worried about it too? How can we make sure AI search engines make the internet better, not worse?\n\nLinks:\n\nAndi - [https://andisearch.com](https://andisearch.com)\n\nDevelopers Digest - [https://github.com/developersdigest/llm-answer-engine](https://github.com/developersdigest/llm-answer-engine)\n\nExa - [https://exa.ai](https://exa.ai)\n\nPerplexity - [https://perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai)\n\nSimplicity - [https://smpl.pongo.ai/](https://smpl.pongo.ai/)\n\nYou - [https://you.com](https://you.com)\n\n## Comment ID las05no with +8 score by [(PSMF_Canuck, Reddit, 2024-06-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1dr0sq9/are_startup_ai_search_engines_going_to_kill_the/las05no/) (in reply to ID 1dr0sq9):\nVast majority of content “creators” provide no value add - they will die.\n\nPeople always find their echo chamber, of that’s what they want.

There will be made use of a dataset. Datasets are the most important thing in the future of any ai model since they determine the quality and accuracy of the ai model.\n\nDatasets need a specific set of data for their training, and most of it comes from big data companies.

We just didn't have the compute to solve the problems before -- we now do, and it's going to continue to get faster and smaller on at least the near and mid horizons. \n\nAlso lets be real, drivers and executive assistants (or PhD researchers) don't require the same skill sets. Drivers gotta be instant-quick and spread attention around them at all times, whereas knowledge workers are leveraged for focus and thinking time (test time compute). Comparing the two at all probably isn't particularly helpful from an intelligence perspective.\n\n#### Comment ID m8ciovj with +1 score by [(finnjon, Reddit, 2025-01-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1i6d8n7/ceo_of_exa_saying_some_interesting_food_for/m8ciovj/) (in reply to ID m8ch8zr):\nI don't doubt we will get there but people seem to assume intelligence is all that is needed, whereas reliability is also needed.

Make no mistakes a human wouldn't make plus make *almost* no mistakes a human *would* make.  Got it.  \n\nI understand that this is what it will take for the average human (who is a raging human shovanist) to accept that AI is \"useful\", but that is just nonsense.  We already have narrow agents (i.e. code) that are incredibly useful.  \n\n>Cars have been able to drive themselves pretty well for years  \n\n\nThis is a perfect example.  Self-driving cars sometimes make mistakes that even a dumb human would never make.  So they must suck.  Let's just ignore the hundreds, nay thousands, of mistakes humans make that a self-driving car *never* makes.\n\nWe know what humans are capable of, so we accept their limitations and work within their constraints.  Normies have some nonsense expectations of what AI should be capable of, and will nitpick away their utility because it fails at some meaningless task children can do.  \n\n>It takes more than intelligence to create useful agents. \n\nYes, but intelligence is 100% the hardest and most important component.

I loved Perplexity at first and switched to it, leaving Chatgpt practically unused for quite some time. I even recommended Pro to a family member.\n\nThen I had a few bad experiences where Perplexity's memory/context was poor. What happened was after just two or three interactions it missed key parts of the context and gave generic answers. This was so poor that I just started using Chatgpt again and since that was around the time 4o came out, the experience was so much better I stuck to Chatgpt.\n\nI like Perplexity for the Discover section mainly, although at this point I guess it's just like any other curated news feed.. but wth I like it. Guess I'll hang on to Perplexity Pro until my year is up, but can't really see myself renewing.. although I've started using the free $5 of API usage so maybe that's worth it 🤔 will have to see..\n\n## Comment ID m2tp1sl with +3 score by [(cbrunofb, Reddit, 2024-12-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/perplexity_ai/comments/1fs6rxo/what_are_your_favorite_perplexity_alternatives_im/m2tp1sl/) (in reply to ID 1fs6rxo):\n[DeepSeek](https://chat.deepseek.com/) with new Search option enabled\n\n### Comment ID m4jl5lz with +1 score by [(rohansahare, Reddit, 2024-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/perplexity_ai/comments/1fs6rxo/what_are_your_favorite_perplexity_alternatives_im/m4jl5lz/) (in reply to ID m2tp1sl):\nYes but the search strength is still limited.

      "# Post ID 1i126r1: tools I use to not have to hire anyone with +405 score by [(Pio_Sce, Reddit, 2025-01-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i126r1/tools_i_use_to_not_have_to_hire_anyone/)\nI’ve spent unreasonable amount of time with AI tools and here’s curated list of ones I recommend for productivity (honestly, some of them can replace an employee):\n\n# General assistants\n\n**ChatGPT** \\- You probably know it. It’s a great tool for ideating, brainstorming, document summarization and quick question-answer work.\n\nThere’s a desktop app available so you can quickly pop it up by pressing control + space, which makes it even better for productivity.\n\n**Claude** \\- Another chat interface, similar to ChatGPT.\n\nIt’s a different model provider so the answers and behavior might be different.\n\nFrom my experience, Claude 3.5 Sonnet is performing better than GPT-4o (but not o1) in tasks that focus on reasoning, code writing and copywriting.\n\nThere’s also a desktop app available.\n\n**Gemini** \\- Honestly, I’m not even sure where to put it.\n\nIt’s Google’s model, one of the most powerful in terms of multimodal capabilities (text, image, audio).\n\nAnd it’s tailored for your Google Workspace.\n\nEmail, docs, spreadsheets, meets, presentation. Anything.\n\n# Research\n\n**Perplexity** \\- Perplexity is an AI search engine that provides answers to questions with up-to-date information.\n\nSo, forget Google. Use Perplexity to get answers to questions and dive down the rabbit hole.\n\n**Exa AI** \\- Exa is another advanced search engine that combines AI-driven neural search with traditional keyword search.\n\nIt understands the semantic meaning of queries and documents.\n\nAnd you can also choose what you want to search: academic articles, news, reports, tweets etc.\n\n# Meetings, calendar and email\n\n**Granola** \\- Great AI notepad for meetings.\n\nIt’s a desktop app, so there’s no bot joining your meetings.\n\nIt automatically transcribes and enhances meeting notes, helping organize and summarize key takeaways and generates action items, follow-up emails, etc.\n\nIt also allows you to ask questions about the transcript and get answers.\n\n**Reclaim** \\- AI-powered calendar that optimizes for productivity.\n\nEssentially, it automates meetings, tracks tasks, and protects deep work time.\n\nCool thing is that it syncs with Google Calendar and Slack.\n\n**Cora** \\- Batch processing emails is one of the main productivity tactics.\n\nCora enables that.\n\nYou only see emails that you need to respond to.\n\nAnd it generates automatic replies for you.\n\nAll other emails are summarized twice a day.\n\n# Knowledge summarization\n\n**Particle News** \\- Short summaries of the daily news. Pretty straightforward.\n\n**Notebook LM** \\- Notebook LM helps process and summarize various types of content, such as PDFs, websites, videos, and more.\n\nThe cool thing is that it provides insights and connections between topics, cites sources and offers audio summaries.\n\nI use it when the content to read is too long and I’m on the go.\n\n**Napkin** \\- For creating visuals from text.\n\nYou can easily generate and customize infographics, diagrams etc.\n\nSo, if you’re brainstorming, writing or preparing for a presentation, Napkin will work well.\n\n# Writing and brainstorming\n\n**Grammarly** \\- Well known grammar checker.\n\nIt helps improve writing by focusing on clarity and tone.\n\nSometimes the Grammarly icon popping up is annoying though.\n\n**Flow** \\- Flow helps you write and edit notes by speaking.\n\nAnd it integrates across all the apps you use, adapts to your tone and style.\n\nCool tool for just yapping!\n\n# Automations\n\n**Gumloop** \\- Think AI-first Zapier, but 100x more powerful.\n\nIt's is a platform for automating complex work using AI via a no-code drag and drop interface.\n\nIt’s very easy to automate work without needing engineers.\n\nAnd they have loads of templates.\n\n**Wordware** \\- A platform for building AI agents with natural language.\n\nHonestly, for folks who are a bit more technical.\n\nYou simply prompt LLM to perform a task for you.\n\nAnd you can build any integration you want.\n\nIf you’re a builder, you can later on connect the agent via API.\n\n\n\nI strongly believe that technology is leverage. And with AI we can be in top 0.1% of people.\n\nIf you want bit deeper dive into the topic, I shared that on my substack (available via link in my profile)\n\n\n\nAny other recommendations for apps I could use? What works if you want to keep the team super lean in early days? \n\n## Comment ID m72m18u with +56 score by [(Prior_Seat_4654, Reddit, 2025-01-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i126r1/tools_i_use_to_not_have_to_hire_anyone/m72m18u/) (in reply to ID 1i126r1):\nmaybe not an AI, but I'd add anything that blocks off social media accounts so I can focus\n\n### Comment ID m74nj3i with +18 score by [(Pio_Sce, Reddit, 2025-01-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i126r1/tools_i_use_to_not_have_to_hire_anyone/m74nj3i/) (in reply to ID m72m18u):\nthis one was recommended to me [https://gofuckingwork.com/](https://gofuckingwork.com/) :))\n\n### Comment ID m746oim with +10 score by [(05fj09, Reddit, 2025-01-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i126r1/tools_i_use_to_not_have_to_hire_anyone/m746oim/) (in reply to ID m72m18u):\nDelete the apps\n\n#### Comment ID m77wy5o with +3 score by [(Samourai03, Reddit, 2025-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i126r1/tools_i_use_to_not_have_to_hire_anyone/m77wy5o/) (in reply to ID m746oim):\nyeah, but you can't delete the full browser on your pc\n\n## Comment ID m73l5vx with +29 score by [(None, Reddit, 2025-01-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i126r1/tools_i_use_to_not_have_to_hire_anyone/m73l5vx/) (in reply to ID 1i126r1):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID m746pug with +7 score by [(swahzey, Reddit, 2025-01-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i126r1/tools_i_use_to_not_have_to_hire_anyone/m746pug/) (in reply to ID m73l5vx):\nThis comment should be at the top. 100% agree.\n\n#### Comment ID m77capa with +2 score by [(RossDCurrie, Reddit, 2025-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i126r1/tools_i_use_to_not_have_to_hire_anyone/m77capa/) (in reply to ID m746pug):\nwhat did it say?\n\n## Comment ID m77cjq9 with +14 score by [(RossDCurrie, Reddit, 2025-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i126r1/tools_i_use_to_not_have_to_hire_anyone/m77cjq9/) (in reply to ID 1i126r1):\nGeneric list of available tools and a description of them, without any substantive strategies on how to use them to **really** build a business, then a substack promo at the end.\n\ngarbage post.\n\n### Comment ID m78klvq with +3 score by [(lastnitesdinner, Reddit, 2025-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i126r1/tools_i_use_to_not_have_to_hire_anyone/m78klvq/) (in reply to ID m77cjq9):\nGarbage sub, lol\n\n## Comment ID m72mw1m with +51 score by [(LaurenceDarabica, Reddit, 2025-01-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i126r1/tools_i_use_to_not_have_to_hire_anyone/m72mw1m/) (in reply to ID 1i126r1):\nA curated list of how to lose your time trying to fake your way through.\n\nGuys, concentrate on what brings value, not catchy trendy bullshit.\n\n### Comment ID m72n2x0 with +25 score by [(Pio_Sce, Reddit, 2025-01-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i126r1/tools_i_use_to_not_have_to_hire_anyone/m72n2x0/) (in reply to ID m72mw1m):\n100% focusing on things that drive business forward is most important.

It was pretty crazy how high those invoices could get to have some concept art done. We just use AI now to make those images and if needed hire some kid to touch them up and it absolutely makes no difference in how our business runs. Investors don't care, other VCs don't care, the rest of the industry and world don't. The speed at which you can have AI whip something up is also so valuable. \n\nI personally think industries such as branding and marketing are cooked, big players will remain but the market is downsizing rapidly and I'm watching entire industries evaporate. People say AI is still years away from making significant impact on the value of human labor but tell that to a graphic designer or writer today. Most of the emails I read now are clearly written by chatGPT and I do the same. \n\nIn the end, I think it's a great thing. Let AI do the heavy lifting, anyone can do anything.\n\n### Comment ID m72n35z with +5 score by [(_WhatchaDoin_, Reddit, 2025-01-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i126r1/tools_i_use_to_not_have_to_hire_anyone/m72n35z/) (in reply to ID m72mw1m):\nI am surprised that we don’t hear about ICOs and NFTs.

Using an aggregating tool like suggested here is interesting and useful I’m sure, but I suspect they use API calls - individual prompts are powerful and good here. \n\nBut my ChatGPT remembers conversations I have with it and I can go back to add questions to any of the dozens of conversations and it remembers the context. I don’t want to overplay this though. I find the limited memory allotted means even when you don’t get “memory full” messages, the longer a conversation gets the more it summarizes internally what you’ve talked about. Simpler conversations can stick around a while, but with complex topics where I keep adding details, it often will start getting sloppy with the details of what I want because it basically had to summarize away the specific details. \n\nAnyway, just wanted to highlight the distinction and how in my mind there are two separate value propositions with API versus the statefulness of paying for ChatGPT\n\n## Comment ID m73hvi8 with +9 score by [(david_slays_giants, Reddit, 2025-01-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i126r1/tools_i_use_to_not_have_to_hire_anyone/m73hvi8/) (in reply to ID 1i126r1):\nGreat list of tools.

Much more powerful than standard PDF search or trying to piece together insights from multiple tools.\n\n## Comment ID m73sizz with +1 score by [(Randusnuder, Reddit, 2025-01-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i126r1/tools_i_use_to_not_have_to_hire_anyone/m73sizz/) (in reply to ID 1i126r1):\nInteresting list.\n\n## Comment ID m74b5zq with +1 score by [(ManicSheep, Reddit, 2025-01-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i126r1/tools_i_use_to_not_have_to_hire_anyone/m74b5zq/) (in reply to ID 1i126r1):\nFollowing\n\n## Comment ID m74olsf with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2025-01-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i126r1/tools_i_use_to_not_have_to_hire_anyone/m74olsf/) (in reply to ID 1i126r1):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID m74z1zg with +2 score by [(Future-Kangaroo1541, Reddit, 2025-01-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i126r1/tools_i_use_to_not_have_to_hire_anyone/m74z1zg/) (in reply to ID m74olsf):\nMy thoughts exactly!

I've had some luck here.  \n\nFor me a Hierarchal process works best.   I could never get this to work well in a sequential environment unless I'm pulling just a single thing.\n\nI have the following agents/tools\n\n\\* Researcher - ExaSearchTool, Serpa: This does all the discovery base information.  (I have a custom tool that searches the Federal Register too)  \n\\* Analyst - WebsiteSearchTool: This does further lookup of the discovery info from the Researcher.  \n\\* Content Writer - No tools (the file write is on the output\\_file of the task) which handles consistent format, I had a writing sample to, etc.\n\nI used small models for Researchers/Analysts.  Models for the planner and content writer depend on complexity and output.  If I need something complex in terms of formatting and prose, I use a large model, otherwise I use a small model for those too.\n\nThat said.  Most of what I have these doing is hitting some information source or the web in general, aggregating updates, stories, and events within a time period and summarizing those with a light bit of trend analysit. So the complexity is fairly low and small is likely sufficient for all of it. \n\nThese all work very well for my use cases, but I have problems in these regions.\n\n1. It is inconsistent in it's output.  The means the formatting is not easy to control specifically, but it doesn't matter all that much to me but if you need it exactly the same everytime, expect to do some manual editing.  \n2. The same problem as everyone where I may have to do multiple runs, becasue the agents get lost on some faulty logic, or just plain stop working.  \n3. They miss information here and there on any indiidual reports.  So if you absolutly have to have everything, this could be a problem. For me it's not a big deal because it's all value add info and missing something one run gets picked up in another so it all works out.\n\n## Comment ID m6fkaua with +1 score by [(No_Marionberry_5366, Reddit, 2025-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crewai/comments/1f9m9ne/did_anyone_develop_a_web_research_agent_crew_that/m6fkaua/) (in reply to ID 1f9m9ne):\nHello, Yes we did !!

We will use GPT 3.5-turbo as our LLM. Let&#39;s ask it for the recent news, like we might ask ChatGPT.\\n import openai\\nopenai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY\\nUSER_QUESTION = &#34;What&#39;s the recent news in physics this week?&#34;\\ncompletion = openai.chat.completions.create(\\nmodel=&#34;gpt-3.5-turbo&#34;,\\nmessages=[\\n{&#34;role&#34;: &#34;system&#34;, &#34;content&#34;: &#34;You are a helpful assistant.&#34;},\\n{&#34;role&#34;: &#34;user&#34;, &#34;content&#34;: USER_QUESTION},\\n],\\n)\\nresponse = completion.choices[0].message.content\\nprint(response)\\n \\n One recent news in physics is that researchers at the University of Illinois have discovered a new topological state of matter. They created a material composed of interacting particles called quadrupoles, which can exhibit unique behavior in their electrical properties. This finding has the potential to pave the way for the development of new types of electronic devices and quantum computers.\\nAnother interesting development is in the field of cosmology. The European Space Agency&#39;s Planck satellite has provided new insights into the early universe. By analyzing the cosmic microwave background radiation, scientists have obtained more accurate measurements of the rate at which the universe is expanding, which could challenge current theories of physics.\\nAdditionally, scientists at CERN&#39;s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have observed a rare phenomenon called charm mixing. They found that particles containing both charm and strange quarks can spontaneously transition between their matter and antimatter states. This discovery could contribute to our understanding of the puzzle of why the universe is primarily made of matter and why there is very little antimatter.\\n \\nOh no! Since the LLM is unable to use recent data, it doesn&#39;t know the latest news. It might tell us some information, but that info isn&#39;t recent, and we can&#39;t be sure it&#39;s trustworthy either since it has no source. Luckily, Exa API allows us to solve these problems by connecting our LLM app to the internet. Here&#39;s how:\\nLet&#39;s use the Exa neural search engine to search the web for relevant links to the user&#39;s question.\\nFirst, we ask the LLM to generate a search engine query based on the question.\\n import openai\\nfrom exa_py import Exa\\nopenai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY\\nexa = Exa(EXA_API_KEY)\\nSYSTEM_MESSAGE = &#34;You are a helpful assistant that generates search queries based on user questions.

The research paper, &#34;Modelling of longitudinally cut carrot curling induced by the vascular cylinder-cortex interference pressure&#34;, is published in Royal Society Open Science.\\nWithout access to labs, Nguyen aimed to identify the geometrical and environmental factors that have the most influence on carrots&#39; longevity. Working in his kitchen, he characterized, analytically modeled and verified the aging of over 100 Lancashire Nantes carrot halves, cut lengthways, using finite-element (FE) models normally used in structural engineering.\\nThe research team concluded that residual stresses and dehydration were the two key factors behind the curling behavior. The starchy outer layer of the carrot (the cortex) is stiffer than the soft central vein (also known as the vascular cylinder). When cut lengthwise, the two carrot halves curl because the difference in stress becomes unbalanced. Dehydration leads to further loss of stiffness, further driving the curling effect.\\nTheir recommendations to manufacturers include handling carrots in cold, moist, airtight and humidity-controlled environments to protect their natural properties and increase their edible life span.\\nThey say the study provides a methodology to predict the deformation of cut root vegetables, adding that the procedure is likely to apply to other plant structures. The study gives food producers a new mathematical tool that could be applied to the design of packaging and food handling processes, potentially reducing food waste.\\nOne of the world&#39;s top crops by market value, carrots are known for their high production efficiency—but despite this, wastage is high. Around 25–30% of this occurs prior to processing and packaging—due to deformities, mechanical damage or infected sections. Fresh cut and minimally processed carrots are a convenient ready-to-use ingredient that make possible the use of carrots that might otherwise be discarded, reducing food waste.\\nDr. Elise Pegg, a senior lecturer in Bath&#39;s Department of Mechanical Engineering, is one of the research paper authors and oversaw the study. She said, &#34;We have mathematically represented the curl of a cut carrot over time, and showed the factors that contribute to curling.\\n&#34;Our motivation was to look for ways to improve the sustainability of carrot processing and make them as long-lasting as possible. We have produced a methodology that a food producer could use to change their processes, reducing food waste and making packaging and transportation more efficient. Understanding the bending behavior in such systems can help us to design and manufacture products with higher durability.\\n&#34;A question like this would normally be investigated from a biological perspective, but we have done this work using purely mechanical principles. I&#39;m so pleased for Nguyen—it&#39;s a measure of his resourcefulness and dedication to produce such interesting research in a challenging situation.&#34;\\nOver the course of a week, the curl of the carrot halves increased—with the average radius of each carrot&#39;s curvature falling from 1.61m to 1.1m. A 1.32-times reduction in stiffness was also seen, correlating with the carrots drying out; on average, their weight fell by 22%.\\nNguyen added, &#34;This was interesting research—to apply mechanical principles to vegetables was surprising and fun.\\n&#34;One of the big challenges was to devise an experiment that could be done in a lockdown setting, without access to normal labs and equipment. To now be in a position to have this work published in an academic journal and potentially be used by the food industry is really rewarding.\\n&#34;This project has inspired me to continue my studies at the University of Bath and I now study residual stresses in porous ferroelectric ceramics for my Ph.D.&#34;\\nAs well as having to use a suitcase to collect the 30kg of carrots the experiment demanded from a farmers&#39; market, a further challenge was finding ways to use them afterward. Carrot cake, the Indian carrot dessert Gajar Ka Halwa, carrot pesto and many other dishes kept Nguyen and his flatmates fed for several days.\\nMore information:\\nModelling of longitudinally cut carrot curling induced by the vascular cylinder-cortex interference pressure, Royal Society Open Science (2024).

Unfortunately, googling “companies similar to Thrifthouse” doesn&#39;t do a very good job. Traditional search engines rely heavily on keyword matching. In this case we get results about physical thrift stores. Hm, that&#39;s not really what I want.\\nLet’s try again, this time searching based on a description of the company, like by googling “community based resale apps.” But, this isn’t very helpful either and just returns premade listicles...\\n What we really need is neural search.\\nExa is a fully neural search engine built using a foundational embeddings model trained for webpage retrieval. It’s capable of understanding entity types (company, blog post, Github repo), descriptors (funny, scholastic, authoritative), and any other semantic qualities inside of a query. Neural search can be far more useful for these types of complex queries.\\nLet&#39;s try Exa, using the Python SDK! We can use thefind_similar_and_contents function to find similar links and get contents from each link. The input is simply a URL, https://thrift.house and we set num_results=10(this is customizable up to thousands of results in Exa).\\nBy specifying highlights={&#34;num_sentences&#34;:2} for each search result, Exa will also identify and return a 2 sentence excerpt from the content that&#39;s relevant to our query.

Now let&#39;s starting building Exa Researcher. The app should be able to automatically generate research reports for all kinds of different topics. Here&#39;s two to start:\\n const SAMA_TOPIC = &#39;Sam Altman&#39;;\\nconst ART_TOPIC = &#39;renaissance art&#39;;\\n \\nThe first thing our app has to do is decide what kind of search to do for the given topic. \\nExa offers two kinds of search: neural and keyword search. Here&#39;s how we decide:\\nNeural search is preferred when the query is broad and complex because it lets us retrieve high quality, semantically relevant data. Neural search is especially suitable when a topic is well-known and popularly discussed on the Internet, allowing the machine learning model to retrieve contents which are more likely recommended by real humans. \\nKeyword search is useful when the topic is specific, local or obscure. If the query is a specific person&#39;s name, and identifier, or acronym, such that relevant results will contain the query itself, keyword search may do well. And if the machine learning model doesn&#39;t know about the topic, but relevant documents can be found by directly matching the search query, keyword search may be necessary.\\nSo, Exa Researcher is going to get a query, and it needs to automatically decide whether to use keyword or neural search to research the query based on the criteria. Sounds like a job for the LLM! But we need to write a prompt that tells it about the difference between keyword and neural search-- oh wait, we have a perfectly good explanation right there.\\n // Let&#39;s generalize the prompt and call the search types (1) and (2) in case the LLM is sensitive to the names. We can replace them with different names programmatically to see what works best.\\nconst SEARCH_TYPE_EXPLANATION = `- (1) search is usually preferred when the query is a broad topic or semantically complex because it lets us retrieve high quality, semantically relevant data. (1) search is especially suitable when a topic is well-known and popularly discussed on the Internet, allowing the machine learning model to retrieve contents which are more likely recommended by real humans.\\n- (2) search is useful when the topic is specific, local or obscure. If the query is a specific person&`;\\n \\nHere&#39;s a function that instructs the LLM to choose between the search types and give its answer in a single word.

Now we have to craft some search queries for the topic and the search type. There are two cases here: keyword search and neural search. Let&#39;s do the easy one first. LLMs already know what Google-like keyword searches look like. So let&#39;s just ask the LLM for what we want:\\n function createKeywordQueryGenerationPrompt(topic, n){\\nreturn `I&`\\n}\\nconsole.log(await getLLMResponse({\\nsystem: &#39;The user will ask you to help generate some search queries.

This is tougher: you can read all about crafting good Exa searches here. But this is actually a really good thing: making the perfect Exa search is hard because Exa is so powerful! Exa allows us to express so much more nuance in our searches and gives us unparalleled ability to steer our search queries towards our real objective.\\nWe need to our app to understand our goal, what Exa is, and how to use it to achieve the goal. So let&#39;s just tell the LLM everything it needs to know.\\n function createNeuralQueryGenerationPrompt(topic, n){\\nreturn `I&`\\n}\\nconsole.log(await getLLMResponse({\\nsystem: &#39;The user will ask you to help generate some search queries.

It is known for combining the advancements in technique with the exploration of deeper layers of meaning in artworks. In Renaissance paintings, the identification of the patron or donor often provides insights into the intended message of the artwork. For example, a painting discussed in an article from the Royal Academy[^1] was commissioned by Jacopo Pesaro, the Bishop of Paphos on the island of Cyprus, and was likely painted by Titian during his early twenties. Analyzing the patronage and symbolism in Renaissance paintings allows for a better understanding of the multifaceted meanings conveyed by the artists.\\nAnother key aspect of studying Renaissance art is understanding the contexts and environments in which art is encountered and viewed. The influence of the viewer&#39;s point of view and focal point plays a critical role in shaping the experience of art. Lectures provided by Wondrium[^3] discuss the importance of first impressions and explore how the artist positions the viewer with respect to the image. Additionally, the genres of Western art and the artist&#39;s media, tools, and techniques are explored in these lectures, providing a comprehensive understanding of the various elements that contribute to the creation and perception of Renaissance art.\\nOverall, studying Renaissance art encompasses an exploration of not only the technical skills and innovations of the artists but also the cultural and historical contexts in which the artworks were created. By analyzing the patronage, symbolism, and viewing experience, researchers gain a deeper appreciation and interpretation of this significant period in the history of art.\\nReferences:\\n[1] How to Read a Renaissance Painting.

However, research published Monday in Nature and PLoS Genetics has provided the first comprehensive look at the genetic origins of their incredible wings.But to appreciate the genetics of their wing development, it’s important to know how crazy a bat in flight truly\\\\xa0looks.Try a little experiment: Stick your arms out to the side, palms facing forward, thumbs pointing up toward the ceiling. Now imagine that your fingers are\\\\xa0long, arching down toward the floor like impossibly unkempt fingernails — but still made of bone, sturdy and spread apart. Picture the sides of your body connecting to your hands, a rubbery membrane attaching your leg and torso to those long fingers, binding you with strong, stretchy skin. Then, finally, imagine using your muscles to flap those enormous hands.Bats, man.As marvelous as bat flight is to behold, the genetic origins of their storied wings has remained murky. However, new findings from an international team of researchers led by Nadav Ahituv, PhD, of the University of California at San Francisco, Nicola Illing, PhD, of the University of Cape Town\\\\xa0in\\\\xa0South Africa\\\\xa0and Katie Pollard, PhD of the UCSF-affiliated Gladstone Institutes has shed new light on how, 50 million years ago, bats took a tetrapod blueprint for arms and legs and went up into the sky.Using a sophisticated set of genetic tools, researchers approached the question of how bats evolved flight by looking not only at which genes were used in the embryonic development of wings, but at what point during development the genes were turned on and off, and — critically — what elements in the genome were regulating the expression of these genes. Genes do not just turn themselves on without input; genetic switches, called enhancers, act to regulate the timing and levels of gene expression in the body.&#39;,\\n&#34;Since flight evolved millions of years ago in all of the groups that are capable of flight today, we can&#39;t observe the changes in behavior and much of the morphology that the evolution of flight involves. We do have the fossil record, though, and it is fairly good for the three main groups that evolved true flight. We&#39;ll spare you an in-depth description of how each group evolved flight for now; see the later exhibits for a description of each group and how they developed flight.&#34;,\\n&#34;It&#39;s easy to forget that one in five species of mammal on this planet have wings capable of delivering spectacularly acrobatic flying abilities. Equally incredibly, two-thirds of these 1,200 species of flying mammal can fly in the dark, using exquisite echolocation to avoid obstacles and snatch airborne prey with stunning deftness. These amazing feats have helped make bats the focus not only of folkloric fascination, but also of biological enquiry and mimicry by human engineers from Leonardo da Vinci onwards. Recent research in PLOS journals continues to add surprising new findings to what we know about bats, and how they might inspire us to engineer manmade machines such as drones to emulate their skills. Bats, unlike most birds and flying insects, have relatively heavy wings – something that might appear disadvantageous. But a recent study in PLOS Biology by Kenny Breuer and colleagues shows that bats can exploit the inertia of the wings to make sharp turns that would be near-impossible using aerodynamic forces alone. The authors combined high-speed film of real bats landing upside-down on ceiling roosts with computational modelling to tease apart aerodynamic and inertial effects.&#34;],\\n[&#34;things, gold and silver, could buy a victory. And this Other Italian cities, inspired by Rome&#39;s example, overpowered occupying troops, shut their gates again and invited a second siege. Hannibal could not punish them without dividing his he had no competent leadership to do so, what with one member of&#34;,\\n&#39;A group of Celts known as the Senone was led through Italy by their commander, Brennus. The Senone Gauls were threatening the nearby town of Clusium, when Roman Ambassadors from the Fabii family were sent to negotiate peace for Clusium. The Romans were notoriously aggressive, and so it is only a little surprising that when a scuffle broke out between the Gauls and Clusians, the Fabii joined in and actually killed a Senone chieftain. The Roman people voted to decide the fate of those who broke the sacred conduct of ambassadors, but the Fabii were so popular that they were instead voted to some of the highest positions in Rome. This absolutely infuriated Brennus and his people and they abandoned everything and headed straight for Rome. Rome was woefully unprepared for this sudden attack. The Gauls had marched with purpose, declaring to all the towns they passed that they would not harm them, they were heading straight for Rome.&#39;,\\n&#34;Hannibal had no intention to sit and recieve the romans in spain.Hannibal clearly considered the nature of roman power-and came to the conclusion that Rome could only be defeated in Italy.The cornerstone of Rome&#39;s power was a strategic manpower base that in theory could produce 7,00,000 infantry and 70,000 cavalry.More than half of this manpower base (4,00,000) was provided by rome&#39;s Italian allies,who paid no taxes but had to render military service to rome&#39;s armies.Not all were content.Carthage on the other hand rarely used its own citizens for war,bulk of its army being mercenaries.In any case its manpower could never even come close to Rome,the fact that had aided roman victory in the 1st Punic war.Hannibal thus understood that Rome could afford to raise and send army after army to spain and take losses. Meanwhile any carthiginian losses in spain would encourage the recently conquered iberian tribes to defect. The only way to defeat Rome,was to fight in italy itself.By winning battle after battle on italian soil and demonstrating to the italian allies rome&#39;s inability to protect them and weakness,he could encourage them to break free of Rome eroding Rome&#39;s manpower to sizeable proportions. But there was one problem,his fleet was tiny and Rome ruled the seas.By land,the coastal route would be blocked by Roman forces and her ally-the great walled city of massalia.Hannibal thus resolved to think and do the impossible - move thousands of miles by land through the pyranees mountains,uncharted territory inhabited by the fierce gauls ,then through the Alps mountains and invade italy. Even before the siege of Saguntum had concluded,Hannibal had set things in motion.Having sent a number of embassies to the Gallic tribes in the Po valley with the mission of establishing a safe place for Hannibal to debouch from the Alps into the Po valley. He did not desire to cross this rugged mountain chain and to descend into the Po valley with exhausted troops only to have to fight a battle.Additionally the fierce gauls would provide a source of manpower for Hannibal&#39;s army.The romans had recently conquered much territory from the gauls in this area,brutally subjagating them ,seizing their land and redistributing it to roman colonists.Thus securing an alliance proved to be easy. After the sack of Saguntum he dismissed his troops to their own localities.&#34;]]\\n \\nNow, let&#39;s give the context we got to our LLM so it can answer our questions with solid sources backing them up!\\n responses = []\\nfor question, info in zip(questions, info_for_llm):\\nsystem_prompt = &#34;You are RAG researcher.

An international team of researchers used genetic tools to study the &#39;\\n&#39;embryonic development of bat wings and the genes involved in their &#39;\\n&#39;formation. They also investigated the regulatory elements in the genome that &#39;\\n&#39;control the expression of these genes. By analyzing these factors, the &#39;\\n&#39;researchers discovered that bats took a tetrapod blueprint for arms and legs &#39;\\n&#39;and adapted it to develop wings, allowing them to fly. This research &#39;\\n&#39;provides a comprehensive understanding of the genetic origins of bat wings &#39;\\n&#39;and how they evolved over 50 million years ago.\\\\n&#39;\\n&#39; &#39;,\\n&#39;\\\\n&#39;\\n&#39; Question: How did Rome defend Italy from Hannibal?\\\\n&#39;\\n&#39; Answer: Rome defended Italy from Hannibal by using various strategies. One &#39;\\n&#39;of the main defenses relied on the Roman manpower base, which consisted of a &#39;\\n&#39;large army made up of Roman citizens and Italian allies who were obligated &#39;\\n&#34;to render military service. Rome&#39;s strategic manpower base was a cornerstone &#34;\\n&#39;of their power, as it could produce a significant number of infantry and &#39;\\n&#39;cavalry. This posed a challenge for Hannibal, as Carthage relied heavily on &#39;\\n&#34;mercenaries and could not match Rome&#39;s manpower.\\\\n&#34;\\n&#39;\\\\n&#39;\\n&#39;Hannibal realized that in order to defeat Rome, he needed to fight them in &#39;\\n&#39;Italy itself. His plan was to win battles on Italian soil and demonstrate &#39;\\n&#34;Rome&#39;s inability to protect their Italian allies, with the intention of &#34;\\n&#34;encouraging them to break free from Rome. This would erode Rome&#39;s manpower &#34;\\n&#39;base to a sizeable proportion. However, Hannibal faced several obstacles. &#39;\\n&#39;Rome ruled the seas, making it difficult for him to transport troops and &#39;\\n&#39;supplies by sea. Additionally, the coastal route to Italy would be blocked &#39;\\n&#39;by Roman forces and their ally, the walled city of Massalia.\\\\n&#39;\\n&#39;\\\\n&#39;\\n&#39;To overcome these challenges, Hannibal devised a daring plan. He decided to &#39;\\n&#39;lead his troops on a treacherous journey through the Pyrenees mountains, &#39;\\n&#39;inhabited by fierce Gauls, and then through the Alps mountains to invade &#39;\\n&#39;Italy. He sent embassies to Gallic tribes in the Po valley, securing &#39;\\n&#39;alliances and establishing a safe place for his army to enter the Po valley &#39;\\n&#39;from the Alps.\\\\n&#39;\\n&#39;\\\\n&#39;\\n&#39;Overall, Rome defended Italy from Hannibal by leveraging their manpower &#39;\\n&#39;base, their control of the seas, and their strategic alliances with Italian &#39;\\n&#39;allies. They also had the advantage of better infrastructure and control &#39;\\n&#39;over resources within Italy itself. These factors ultimately played a &#39;\\n&#34;significant role in Rome&#39;s defense against Hannibal&#39;s invasion.\\\\n&#34;\\n&#39; &#39;]\\n \\nExa can be used for more than simple question answering. One superpower of embeddings-based search is that we can search for the meaning of sentences or even paragraphs:\\n paragraph = &#34;&#34;&#34;\\nGeorgism, also known as Geoism, is an economic philosophy and ideology named after the American\\npolitical economist Henry George (1839–1897).This doctrine advocates for the societal collective,\\nrather than individual property owners, to capture the economic value derived from land and other\\nural resources. To this end, Georgism proposes a single tax on the unimproved value of land, known\\nas a &#34;land value tax,&#34; asserting that this would deter speculative land holding and promote efficient\\nuse of valuable resources. Adherents argue that because the supply of land is fundamentally inelastic,\\ntaxing it will not deter its availability or use, unlike other forms of taxation. Georgism differs\\nfrom Marxism and capitalism, underscoring the distinction between common and private property while\\nlargely contending that individuals should own the fruits of their labor.&#34;&#34;&#34;\\nquery = f&#34;The best academic source about {paragraph} is (paper: &#34;\\ngeorgism_search_response = exa.search_and_contents(paragraph, highlights=highlights_options, num_results=5, use_autoprompt=False)\\n \\n for result in georgism_search_response.results:\\nprint(result.title)\\nprint(result.url)\\npprint(result.highlights)\\n \\n Henry George\\nhttps://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Henry_George\\n[&#34;George&#39;s theory of interest is nowadays dismissed even by some otherwise &#34;\\n&#39;Georgist authors, who see it as mistaken and irrelevant to his ideas about &#39;\\n&#39;land and free trade. The separation of the value of land into improved and &#39;\\n&#34;unimproved is problematic in George&#39;s theory. Once construction has taken &#34;\\n&#39;place, not only the land on which such improvements were made is affected, &#39;\\n&#39;the value of neighboring, as yet unimproved, land is impacted. Thus, while &#39;\\n&#39;the construction of a major attraction nearby may increase the value of &#39;\\n&#39;land, the construction of factories or nuclear power plants decreases its &#39;\\n&#39;value. Indeed, location is the single most important asset in real estate. &#39;\\n&#39;George intended to propose a tax that would have the least negative impact &#39;\\n&#39;on productive activity. However, even unimproved land turns out to be &#39;\\n&#39;affected in value by productive activity in the neighborhood.&#39;]\\nWikiwand\\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Georgism\\n[&#39;Georgism is concerned with the distribution of economic rent caused by land &#39;\\n&#39;ownership, natural monopolies, pollution rights, and control of the commons, &#39;\\n&#39;including title of ownership for natural resources and other contrived &#39;\\n&#39;privileges (e.g. intellectual property). Any natural resource which is &#39;\\n&#39;inherently limited in supply can generate economic rent, but the classical &#39;\\n&#39;and most significant example of land monopoly involves the extraction of &#39;\\n&#39;common ground rent from valuable urban locations. Georgists argue that &#39;\\n&#39;taxing economic rent is efficient, fair and equitable. The main Georgist &#39;\\n&#39;policy recommendation is a tax assessed on land value, arguing that revenues &#39;\\n&#39;from a land value tax (LVT) can be used to reduce or eliminate existing &#39;\\n&#39;taxes (such as on income, trade, or purchases) that are unfair and &#39;\\n&#39;inefficient. Some Georgists also advocate for the return of surplus public &#39;\\n&#34;revenue to the people by means of a basic income or citizen&#39;s dividend. The &#34;\\n&#39;concept of gaining public revenues mainly from land and natural resource &#39;\\n&#39;privileges was widely popularized by Henry George through his first book, &#39;\\n&#39;Progress and Poverty (1879).&#39;]\\nHenry George\\nhttps://www.conservapedia.com/Henry_George\\n[&#39;He argued that land, unlike other factors of production, is supplied by &#39;\\n&#39;nature and that rent is unearned surplus. The landless deserve their share &#39;\\n&#39;of this surplus as a birthright, according to George. Henry George was born &#39;\\n&#39;in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the 2nd of September 1839. He settled in &#39;\\n&#39;California in 1858; then later removed to New York in 1880; was first a &#39;\\n&#39;printer, then an editor, but finally devoted all his life to economic and &#39;\\n&#39;social questions. In 1860, George met Annie Corsina Fox. Her family was very &#39;\\n&#39;opposed to the relationship, and in 1861 they eloped. In 1871 he published &#39;\\n&#39;Our Land Policy, which, as further developed in 1879 under the title of &#39;\\n&#39;Progress and Poverty, speedily attracted the widest attention both in &#39;\\n&#39;America and in Europe.&#39;]\\nGeorgism - Wikipedia\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism\\n[&#39;A key issue to the popular adoption of Georgism is that homes are illiquid &#39;\\n&#39;yet governments need cash every year. Some economists have proposed other &#39;\\n&#39;ways of extracting value from land such as building government housing and &#39;\\n&#39;selling homes to new buyers in areas of fast-rising land value. The &#39;\\n&#39;government would theoretically collect revenue from home sales without much &#39;\\n&#39;cost to current homeowners while slowing down land value appreciation in &#39;\\n&#39;high-demand areas. Henry George, whose writings and advocacy form the basis &#39;\\n&#39;for Georgism Georgist ideas heavily influenced the politics of the early &#39;\\n&#39;20th century. Political parties that were formed based on Georgist ideas &#39;\\n&#39;include the Commonwealth Land Party in the United States, the Henry George &#39;\\n&#39;Justice Party in Victoria, the Single Tax League in South Australia, and the &#39;\\n&#34;Justice Party in Denmark. In the United Kingdom, George&#39;s writings were &#34;\\n&#39;praised by emerging socialist groups in 1890s such as the Independent Labour &#39;\\n&#39;Party and the Fabian Society, which would each go on to help form the &#39;\\n&#39;modern-day Labour Party.&#39;]\\nGeorgism\\nhttps://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Georgism\\n[&#39;Even with mostly primitive methods, land values are already assessed around &#39;\\n&#39;the world wherever property/council taxes exist, and some municipalities &#39;\\n&#39;even collect all their revenue from land values. Though these are &#39;\\n&#39;market-based measures, they can still prove difficult and require upfront &#39;\\n&#39;investment. Georgists believe that the potential value of land is greater &#39;\\n&#39;than the current sum of government spending, since the abolition of taxes on &#39;\\n&#39;labor and investment would further increase the value of land. Conversely, &#39;\\n&#39;the libertarian strain in Georgism is evident in the notion that their land &#39;\\n&#39;tax utopia also entails reducing or eliminating the need for many of the &#39;\\n&#39;things governments currently supply, such as welfare, infrastructure to &#39;\\n&#39;support urban sprawl, and military &amp; foreign aid spending to secure &#39;\\n&#34;resources abroad. Therefore, many Georgists propose a citizen&#39;s dividend. &#34;\\n&#39;This is a similar concept to basic income but its proponents project its &#39;\\n&#39;potential to be much larger due to supposedly huge takings from the land &#39;\\n&#39;tax, combined with lowered government spending. It has been recognized since &#39;\\n&#39;Adam Smith and David Ricardo that a tax on land value itself cannot be &#39;\\n&#39;passed on to tenants, but instead would be paid for by the owners of the &#39;\\n&#39;land:&#39;]\\n \\nUsing Exa, we can easily find related papers, either for further research or to provide a source for our claims.

In doing\\nso, we’ll convert an internet landfill into a library of knowledge with each and every search. That's why we chose the name Exa. Exa means 10^18th power. Google means 10^100th power. While\\nGoogle aims to surface all information, Exa aims to filter all information into organized\\nknowledge. And when it comes to organized knowledge, 10^18 is greater than 10^100. Why .ai? It just so happens that a creature recently emerged on this planet with a particularly strong\\nneed for organized, high quality knowledge. AIs, powered by LLMs like ChatGPT, are overhauling the way we do knowledge work. But to\\nperform knowledge work optimally, AIs must incorporate the internet’s knowledge. That means\\nthey need to be paired with a web retrieval system, like Exa. The quality of web retrieval particularly matters for LLMs. If retrieval returns junk\\ninformation, the LLM will output junk content. If the retrieval is powerful enough to filter\\nthe internet to the right knowledge, the LLM will output the highest quality content possible. Most of our customers have tried search APIs like Bing and Google SERP. They come to us\\nbecause those APIs just don’t work for their use cases. Those APIs work for humans, but not\\nfor LLMs, which have quite different needs. We’ve been on the frontlines witnessing this transformation of knowledge work and of\\nretrieval.

      "# [Exa AI: A true AI search engine by Brain Titan, braintitan.medium.com on 2024-07-20](https://braintitan.medium.com/exa-ai-a-true-ai-search-engine-should-be-the-google-of-ai-348332aa5c9c)\nBrain Titan\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n5 min read\n\n·\n\nJul 20, 2024\n\n--\n\nAnother AI search engine is born: Exa AI. The company recently announced that it has received $17 million in Series A funding, led by Lightspeed, with participation from Nvidia’s NVentures and Y Combinator.\n\nUnlike other AI-driven search engines that aim to replace Google, Exa aims to create a search tool designed specifically for AI.\n\nExa’s Mission :\n\nThe Internet contains humanity’s collective knowledge, but the current search experience is more like navigating a garbage dump than wandering through a library of knowledge. The core problem is that Internet knowledge is buried under a large amount of information.\n\nExa’s mission is to organize the world’s knowledge, filter information and extract real knowledge through better search algorithms.\n\nUnlike traditional search engines, Exa’s search engine is designed specifically for AI models to help them search for information on the Internet and return accurate answers, rather than relying on keyboard input from human users.\n\nExa’s search engine uses vector databases and embedding models to train models to predict the next relevant link rather than the next word. This approach enables Exa to process link datasets and provide unique search results.\n\nExa can understand complex queries and accurately filter Internet information by using embedding models to convert web page content into a list of values. This method can better understand and match query content and return results that are more in line with actual needs.\n\nExa’s technical advantages :\n\nExa is the first web-scale neural search engine that uses end-to-end Transformer technology (the same technology as ChatGPT) to filter by meaning rather than keywords.\n\nFor example, searching for “startups working on climate change” on Exa will return startups that are actually working on climate change, rather than irrelevant pages that are optimized for the keyword.\n\nModel training:\n\nExa’s model training data set includes shared links on web pages, rather than simple text and sentences. This allows its search engine to better understand and predict the relevance of web page links.\n\nExa’s search engine doesn’t just predict the next word, but the next related link. This means that its model training is not based on the continuous word sequence of natural language, but on the relationship and structure of web page links.\n\nIn other words, its model learns how to navigate from one link to the next related link, rather than generating coherent text.\n\nExa’s training method focuses on predicting the most relevant links, avoiding SEO spam in traditional search engines and low-quality AI-generated content.\n\nMain functions and features:\n\nSemantic Search : Exa’s search engine is able to understand semantic meaning, not just keyword matching, to provide more relevant search results.\n\nContent crawling : You can crawl complete and cleaned content from any web page to provide high-quality data for AI.\n\nSimilarity search : Find similar results by URL or long text, making the search more accurate.\n\nLarge-scale data processing : Able to process up to 1 million search results, meeting the needs of AI large-scale data processing.\n\nReal-time updates : crawl new URLs every minute to ensure that the AI ​​always has the latest data.\n\nPowerful filtering capabilities : You can search by domain name, date range, or data category, providing a highly customized search experience.\n\nSimple API integration : Exa provides a simple and easy-to-use API, developers can integrate and use Exa’s search function with just a few lines of code.\n\nExa AI’s technical principles\n\n1. Embedding Model :\n\nDefinition : Embedding models are models that convert text into high-dimensional numerical vectors (embeddings). These vectors mathematically represent the content of the text so that similar content is closer in the vector space.\n\nImplementation : Exa uses the same technology as ChatGPT to train an embedding model to convert web page content into vector representations, making the search process smarter and more precise.\n\n2. End-to-end Transformer model :\n\nDefinition : Transformer is a neural network architecture widely used in natural language processing tasks. It captures the relationship between various parts of the text through a self-attention mechanism.\n\nApplication : Exa uses an end-to-end Transformer model to filter Internet information based on the actual meaning of the query rather than keywords. This approach enables Exa to better understand complex queries and provide more accurate search results.\n\n3. Efficient information filtering :\n\nProblem : Traditional search engines (such as Google) rely on keyword matching and are easily interfered with by SEO optimized content, returning a large amount of irrelevant information.\n\nSolution : Exa uses embedded models and Transformer technology to filter information based on the actual meaning of the query, avoid irrelevant and low-quality content, and return truly relevant knowledge.\n\n4. Real-time content extraction :\n\nDefinition : Exa’s “highlights” feature can instantly extract web page content from search results and customize the length and amount of content according to user needs.\n\nImplementation : Exa chunks and embeds full web pages in the background, using a paragraph prediction model to extract content. This enables Exa to provide high-quality search results instantly when users query.\n\n5. Long query processing :\n\nCapabilities : Exa is able to process long queries, including sentences, paragraphs, and even entire web pages. This means that users can ask more complex and specific questions, and Exa will still be able to return accurate results.\n\nApplications : This is very useful for research work, writing assistants, learning tools, and other application scenarios that require detailed information.\n\n6. High-quality retrieval :\n\nRequirements : Large language models (LLMs) require high-quality retrieval results to ensure the quality of output content.\n\nImplementation : Exa provides high-quality web retrieval for LLMs, filters out low-quality and irrelevant information, and ensures that the output content of LLMs is of high quality. This makes Exa play an important role in AI applications.\n\nWebsite: https://exa.ai/\n\nExa AI: A true AI search engine | KCGOD\n\nAnother AI search engine is born: Exa AI.

      "# [Exa raises $17M from Lightspeed, Nvidia, Y Combinator to build a Google for AIs by Julie Bort on 2024-07-16](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/16/exa-raises-17m-lightspeed-nvidia-ycombinator-google-ai-models/)\nWhile there’s no shortage of startups aiming to replace Google with AI-powered search (we’re looking at you, Perplexity), a startup called Exa has a different idea: a Google for AI.\n\nHumans aren’t the ones who desperately need a new kind of search engine, Exa’s founders believe. Rather, as AI increasingly takes hold in corporate and consumer life, it is the AI platforms themselves that must regularly venture out onto the internet to search for information and return bona fide answers, not hallucinations. And they can’t just type their requests on their keyboards.\n\nExa is building a tool that allows AI models to perform something like a web search, but with an AI-native twist.\n\nThe co-founders bought a million dollars’ worth of GPUs (which were easier to get in those days) and, using a vector database and embeddings (not a classic transformer-based LLM), they began to build a machine learning model trained to natively understand links rather than words and sentences.\n\n“Transformers normally predict the next word. We train our search engine to predict the next link,” CEO Will Bryk says. “So people share links on the web; we use that data as a dataset for our model that we train. And we train the model to predict the next link. So it’s a novel search algorithm.”\n\nSo just as an LLM would complete a sentence by furnishing the most probable next word, Exa’s system does so with the most probable link (or 10), but presumably minus the SEO spam and (ironically) AI-generated chum clogging every ordinary search engine these days.\n\nOn Monday the startup announced it raised a new $17 million Series A led by Lightspeed’s Guru Chahal, with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures and Y Combinator, it exclusively told TechCrunch. Exa has now raised a total of $22 million, including its previous $5 million seed. (Exa was in the summer 2021 YC cohort.)\n\n“This is a very ambitious vision,” says Chahal. “What Google is to humans, they are building for AI.”\n\nThe team was founded about a year before ChatGPT was launched, by two best friends who met their freshman year at Harvard: CEO Will Bryk (now 27) and co-founder Jeff Wang (26).\n\n“We launched before ChatGPT. Our initial goal as a company was not to serve AIs at all. It was: how do you use AI to build better search?” Wang said.\n\nAfter ChatGPT stormed the tech world, AI companies began asking Exa for an API version of their search engine that they could plug into their models. Exa is located in San Francisco, part of the cozy Cerebral Valley AI startup set. In fact, as TechCrunch previously reported, a tweet by Wang went viral when he was looking for other companies that wanted to go in on an order of office nap pods and the response was overwhelming. (The work-nap-repeat culture is alive and well in this part of the tech industry.)\n\nWith AI companies now as its primary customers, use cases for Exa’s search engine span everything from an AI chatbot looking up info on the internet while answering customers’ questions to companies looking to curate training data.\n\nDatabricks, for instance, is Exa’s marquee customer, using it to find large training sets for its own model training initiatives, the founders say.\n\nThe API version of the product was launched around a year ago. “Since then it’s gotten a crazy amount of traction,” Wang says. Today Exa says it’s serving thousands of developers — although it’s worth pointing out that Exa has a free tier that allows anyone to try its search engine in a limited way. It also has multiple tiered-fee levels. The founders wouldn’t reveal revenue except to say that they have some and the number is going up. (Interestingly, apart from running its own GPU-cluster, Exa hosts its product on AWS, not the AI-forward Google Cloud.)\n\nThe team isn’t particularly focused on being the search startup that upends Google. Although if AI becomes the be-all/end-all that the tech industry thinks it will be, search engines for AI bots could be the unexpected threat to the search hegemony.",
      "# [How to Integrate Exa.ai Semantic Search into Google Apps Script? [Tutorial] by Kamil Stanuch, kamilstanuch.medium.com on 2024-10-31](https://kamilstanuch.medium.com/how-to-integrate-exa-ai-semantic-search-into-google-apps-script-tutorial-e46d1406936b)\nI’ve developed a client library that simplifies integrating Exa.ai’s semantic search capabilities into your Google Apps Script projects. This post provides a walkthrough of how to use the library.\n\nWhat is Exa.ai?\n\nExa.ai is a semantic search engine that allows you to search for information based on meaning, not just keywords. This is particularly useful when you need to find information related to a concept rather than a specific phrase.\n\nLibrary Features\n\nThis unofficial Exa.ai client for Google Apps Script offers:\n\nFull Exa.ai API Compatibility: Access the full range of Exa.ai’s search functionality.\n\nFamiliar Interface: The library uses a structure similar to the official exa-js npm package, making it easier to transition between environments.\n\nSeamless Google Apps Script Integration: Easily incorporate Exa.ai searches into your Google Sheets, Docs, or other Apps Script projects.\n\nSupport for all Exa.ai Search Types and Filters: Utilize different search types (neural, keyword, auto) and filters (category, date, domain).\n\nDetailed Logging: Enable logging for debugging and monitoring API requests and responses.\n\nComprehensive Documentation and Examples: Clear documentation and examples to help you get started quickly.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:\n\nExa.ai Account and API Key: You can obtain an API key from Exa.ai.\n\nAccess to Google Apps Script: You can access Google Apps Script through script.google.com.\n\nGetting Started\n\nHere’s how to integrate the Exa.ai library into your Google Apps Script project:\n\nCopy the Library: Copy the contents of the exa.gs file (here) into your Apps Script project.\n\nSet Your API Key:\n\nIn your Apps Script project, navigate to File > Project settings > Script properties.\n\nAdd a new property with the following:\n\nName: EXA_API_KEY\n\nValue: Your Exa.ai API key\n\nUse the Library: You can now start using the library in your Apps Script functions.\n\nCode Example: Basic News Search\n\nfunction searchNews() {\n\nconst exa = new Exa(PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().getProperty('EXA_API_KEY'));\n\nconst results = exa.searchAndContents(\"Latest AI developments\", {\n\ncategory: \"news_article\",\n\nnumResults: 5\n\n});\n\nreturn results;\n\n}\n\nThis simple example demonstrates how to search for the latest AI developments in news articles. The searchAndContents function returns an object containing the search results.\n\nCreating an Exa Client\n\nconst exa = new Exa(apiKey);\n\nexa.setLogging(true); // Optional: Enable debug logging\n\nSearch Methods\n\nThe primary search method is searchAndContents(query, options). This method retrieves search results including full text and summaries.\n\nquery (string): The search query string.\n\noptions (object): An object containing various search parameters (detailed below).\n\nAvailable Search Options\n\nThe options object can include the following parameters:\n\ntype: “neural”, “keyword”, or “auto” (default: “neural”). Specifies the search type.\n\ncategory: Filters results by category (e.g., “company”, “research_paper”, “news_article”). See full list in the code comments.\n\nuseAutoprompt: boolean (default: true). Whether to use Exa.ai’s autoprompt feature.\n\nnumResults: number (default: 10). The number of results to retrieve.\n\nlivecrawl: “always” or “fallback”. Specifies when to perform a live crawl.\n\nincludeDomains: string[]. An array of domains to include in the search.\n\nexcludeDomains: string[]. An array of domains to exclude from the search.\n\nstartPublishedDate: string (ISO format). Filters results by publish date.\n\nendPublishedDate: string (ISO format). Filters results by publish date.\n\nstartCrawlDate: string (ISO format). Filters results by crawl date.\n\nendCrawlDate: string (ISO format). Filters results by crawl date.\n\ntext: An object with options for retrieving text content (includeHtmlTags, maxCharacters).\n\nhighlights: An object for configuring highlights (query, numSentences, highlightsPerUrl).\n\nsummary: An object for configuring summaries (query).\n\nAdvanced Example: Company Search\n\nfunction searchAICompanies() {\n\nconst exa = new Exa(PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().getProperty('EXA_API_KEY'));\n\nreturn exa.searchAndContents(\n\n\"innovative AI startups in natural language processing\",\n\n{\n\ntype: \"neural\",\n\ncategory: \"company\",\n\nnumResults: 20,\n\nstartPublishedDate: \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n\ntext: {\n\nmaxCharacters: 1000\n\n},\n\nhighlights: {\n\nquery: \"AI capabilities and innovations\",\n\nnumSentences: 2\n\n},\n\nsummary: {\n\nquery: \"What are their main AI products and innovations?\"\n\n}\n\n}\n\n);\n\n}\n\nThis example shows a more complex search for AI startups, demonstrating the use of various filters and options for refining results.\n\n8 Ideas of Integrations/Products Exa.ai + Google Apps Scripts\n\nSome ideas on what you can build combining\n\n@ExaAILabs with Google Workspace: research dashboards, smart docs assistant, meeting brief generator, form response enrichment, and more.\n\n1. Research Dashboard in Google Sheets: Auto-updates daily with latest industry news and research for specified topics. Creates a summary table with key findings and source links.\n\n2.

Smart Slides Research: While creating presentations, suggests relevant statistics, quotes, and sources based on your slide content through a sidebar.\n\n7. Domain Expert Finder: Input a technical topic or problem, and get a spreadsheet of relevant experts, their recent work, and contact information found from personal websites and academic profiles.",
      "# [Beating Google at Search with Neural PageRank and $5M of H200s — with Will Bryk of Exa.ai by Latent.Space, swyx & Alessio on 2025-01-10](https://www.latent.space/p/exa)\nApplications close Monday for the NYC AI Engineer Summit focusing on AI Leadership and Agent Engineering! If you applied, invites should be rolling out shortly.\n\nThe search landscape is experiencing a fundamental shift. Google built a >$2T company with the “10 blue links” experience, driven by PageRank as the core innovation for ranking. This was a big improvement from the previous directory-based experiences of AltaVista and Yahoo. Almost 4 decades later, Google is now stuck in this links-based experience, especially from a business model perspective.\n\nThis legacy architecture creates fundamental constraints:\n\nMust return results in ~400 milliseconds\n\nRequired to maintain comprehensive web coverage\n\nTied to keyword-based matching algorithms\n\nCost structures optimized for traditional indexing\n\nAs we move from the era of links to the era of answers, the way search works is changing. You’re not showing a user links, but the goal is to provide context to an LLM. This means moving from keyword based search to more semantic understanding of the content:\n\nThe link prediction objective can be seen as like a neural PageRank because what you're doing is you're predicting the links people share... but it's more powerful than PageRank. It's strictly more powerful because people might refer to that Paul Graham fundraising essay in like a thousand different ways. And so our model learns all the different ways.\n\nAll of this is now powered by a $5M cluster with 144 H200s:\n\nThis architectural choice enables entirely new search capabilities:\n\nComprehensive result sets instead of approximations\n\nDeep semantic understanding of queries\n\nAbility to process complex, natural language requests\n\nAs search becomes more complex, time to results becomes a variable:\n\nPeople think of searches as like, oh, it takes 500 milliseconds because we've been conditioned... But what if searches can take like a minute or 10 minutes or a whole day, what can you then do?\n\nUnlike traditional search engines' fixed-cost indexing, Exa employs a hybrid approach:\n\nFront-loaded compute for indexing and embeddings\n\nVariable inference costs based on query complexity\n\nMix of owned infrastructure ($5M H200 cluster) and cloud resources\n\nExa sees a lot of competition from products like Perplexity and ChatGPT Search which layer AI on top of traditional search backends, but Exa is betting that true innovation requires rethinking search from the ground up. For example, the recently launched Websets, a way to turn searches into structured output in grid format, allowing you to create lists and databases out of web pages. The company raised a $17M Series A to build towards this mission, so keep an eye out for them in 2025.\n\nChapters\n\n00:00:00 Introductions\n\n00:01:12 ExaAI's initial pitch and concept\n\n00:02:33 Will's background at SpaceX and Zoox\n\n00:03:45 Evolution of ExaAI (formerly Metaphor Systems)\n\n00:05:38 Exa's link prediction technology\n\n00:09:20 Meaning of the name \"Exa\"\n\n00:10:36 ExaAI's new product launch and capabilities\n\n00:13:33 Compute budgets and variable compute products\n\n00:14:43 Websets as a B2B offering\n\n00:19:28 How do you build a search engine?\n\n00:22:43 What is Neural PageRank?\n\n00:27:58 Exa use cases\n\n00:35:00 Auto-prompting\n\n00:38:42 Building agentic search\n\n00:44:19 Is o1 on the path to AGI?\n\n00:49:59 Company culture and nap pods\n\n00:54:52 Economics of AI search and the future of search technology\n\nFull YouTube Transcript\n\nPlease like and subscribe!\n\nShow Notes\n\nExaAI\n\nWeb Search Product\n\nWebsets\n\nSeries A Announcement\n\nExa Nap Pods\n\nPerplexity AI\n\nCharacter.AI\n\nTranscript\n\nAlessio [00:00:00]: Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Latent Space podcast. This is Alessio, partner and CTO at Decibel Partners, and I'm joined by my co-host Swyx, founder of Smol.ai.\n\nSwyx [00:00:10]: Hey, and today we're in the studio with my good friend and former landlord, Will Bryk. Roommate. How you doing? Will, you're now CEO co-founder of ExaAI, used to be Metaphor Systems. What's your background, your story?\n\nWill [00:00:30]: Yeah, sure. So, yeah, I'm CEO of Exa. I've been doing it for three years. I guess I've always been interested in search, whether I knew it or not. Like, since I was a kid, I've always been interested in, like, high-quality information. And, like, you know, even in high school, wanted to improve the way we get information from news. And then in college, built a mini search engine. And then with Exa, like, you know, it's kind of like fulfilling the dream of actually being able to solve all the information needs I wanted as a kid. Yeah, I guess. I would say my entire life has kind of been rotating around this problem, which is pretty cool. Yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:00:50]: What'd you enter YC with?\n\nWill [00:00:53]: We entered YC with, uh, we are better than Google. Like, Google 2.0.\n\nSwyx [00:01:12]: What makes you say that? Like, that's so audacious to come out of the box with.\n\nWill [00:01:16]: Yeah, okay, so you have to remember the time. This was summer 2021. And, uh, GPT-3 had come out. Like, here was this magical thing that you could talk to, you could enter a whole paragraph, and it understands what you mean, understands the subtlety of your language. And then there was Google. Uh, which felt like it hadn't changed in a decade, uh, because it really hadn't. And it, like, you would give it a simple query, like, I don't know, uh, shirts without stripes, and it would give you a bunch of results for the shirts with stripes. And so, like, Google could barely understand you, and GBD3 could. And the theory was, what if you could make a search engine that actually understood you? What if you could apply the insights from LLMs to a search engine? And it's really been the same idea ever since. And we're actually a lot closer now, uh, to doing that. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:01:55]: Did you have any trouble making people believe? Obviously, there's the same element. I mean, YC overlap, was YC pretty AI forward, even 2021, or?\n\nWill [00:02:03]: It's nothing like it is today. But, um, uh, there were a few AI companies, but, uh, we were definitely, like, bold. And I think people, VCs generally like boldness, and we definitely had some AI background, and we had a working demo. So there was evidence that we could build something that was going to work. But yeah, I think, like, the fundamentals were there. I think people at the time were talking about how, you know, Google was failing in a lot of ways. And so there was a bit of conversation about it, but AI was not a big, big thing at the time. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:02:33]: Before we jump into Exa, any fun background stories? I know you interned at SpaceX, any Elon, uh, stories? I know you were at Zoox as well, you know, kind of like robotics at Harvard. Any stuff that you saw early that you thought was going to get solved that maybe it's not solved today?\n\nWill [00:02:48]: Oh yeah. I mean, lots of things like that. Like, uh, I never really learned how to drive because I believed Elon that self-driving cars would happen. It did happen. And I take them every night to get home. But it took like 10 more years than I thought. Do you still not know how to drive? I know how to drive now. I learned it like two years ago. That would have been great to like, just, you know, Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know? Um, I was obsessed with Elon. Yeah. I mean, I worked at SpaceX because I really just wanted to work at one of his companies. And I remember they had a rule, like interns cannot touch Elon. And, um, that rule actually influenced my actions.\n\nSwyx [00:03:18]: Is it, can Elon touch interns? Ooh, like physically?\n\nWill [00:03:22]: Or like talk? Physically, physically, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, interesting. He's changed a lot, but, um, I mean, his companies are amazing. Um,\n\nSwyx [00:03:28]: What if you beat him at Diablo 2, Diablo 4, you know, like, Ah, maybe.\n\nAlessio [00:03:34]: I want to jump into, I know there's a lot of backstory used to be called metaphor system. So, um, and it, you've always been kind of like a prominent company, maybe at least RAI circles in the NSF.\n\nSwyx [00:03:45]: I'm actually curious how Metaphor got its initial aura. You launched with like, very little. We launched very little. Like there was, there was this like big splash image of like, this is Aurora or something. Yeah. Right. And then I was like, okay, what this thing, like the vibes are good, but I don't know what it is. And I think, I think it was much more sort of maybe consumer facing than what you are today. Would you say that's true?\n\nWill [00:04:06]: No, it's always been about building a better search algorithm, like search, like, just like the vision has always been perfect search. And if you do that, uh, we will figure out the downstream use cases later. It started on this fundamental belief that you could have perfect search over the web and we could talk about what that means. And like the initial thing we released was really just like our first search engine, like trying to get it out there. Kind of like, you know, an open source. So when OpenAI released, uh, ChachBt, like they didn't, I don't know how, how much of a game plan they had. They kind of just wanted to get something out there.\n\nSwyx [00:04:33]: Spooky research preview.\n\nWill [00:04:34]: Yeah, exactly. And it kind of morphed from a research company to a product company at that point. And I think similarly for us, like we were research, we started as a research endeavor with a, you know, clear eyes that like, if we succeed, it will be a massive business to make out of it. And that's kind of basically what happened. I think there are actually a lot of parallels to, of w between Exa and OpenAI. I often say we're the OpenAI of search. Um, because. Because we're a research company, we're a research startup that does like fundamental research into, uh, making like AGI for search in a, in a way. Uh, and then we have all these like, uh, business products that come out of that.\n\nSwyx [00:05:08]: Interesting. I want to ask a little bit more about Metaforesight and then we can go full Exa. When I first met you, which was really funny, cause like literally I stayed in your house in a very historic, uh, Hayes, Hayes Valley place. You said you were building sort of like link prediction foundation model, and I think there's still a lot of foundation model work. I mean, within Exa today, but what does that even mean? I cannot be the only person confused by that because like there's a limited vocabulary or tokens you're telling me, like the tokens are the links or, you know, like it's not, it's not clear. Yeah.\n\nWill [00:05:38]: Uh, what we meant by link prediction is that you are literally predicting, like given some texts, you're predicting the links that follow. Yes. That refers to like, it's how we describe the training procedure, which is that we find links on the web. Uh, we take the text surrounding the link. And then we predict. Which link follows you, like, uh, you know, similar to transformers where, uh, you're trying to predict the next token here, you're trying to predict the next link. And so you kind of like hide the link from the transformer. So if someone writes, you know, imagine some article where someone says, Hey, check out this really cool aerospace startup. And they, they say spacex.com afterwards, uh, we hide the spacex.com and ask the model, like what link came next. And by doing that many, many times, you know, billions of times, you could actually build a search engine out of that because then, uh, at query time at search time. Uh, you type in, uh, a query that's like really cool aerospace startup and the model will then try to predict what are the most likely links. So there's a lot of analogs to transformers, but like to actually make this work, it does require like a different architecture than, but it's transformer inspired. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:06:41]: What's the design decision between doing that versus extracting the link and the description and then embedding the description and then using, um, yeah. What do you need to predict the URL versus like just describing, because you're kind of do a similar thing in a way. Right. It's kind of like based on this description, it was like the closest link for it. So one thing is like predicting the link. The other approach is like I extract the link and the description, and then based on the query, I searched the closest description to it more. Yeah.\n\nWill [00:07:09]: That, that, by the way, that is, that is the link refers here to a document. It's not, I think one confusing thing is it's not, you're not actually predicting the URL, the URL itself that would require like the, the system to have memorized URLs. You're actually like getting the actual document, a more accurate name could be document prediction. I see. This was the initial like base model that Exo was trained on, but we've moved beyond that similar to like how, you know, uh, to train a really good like language model, you might start with this like self-supervised objective of predicting the next token and then, uh, just from random stuff on the web. But then you, you want to, uh, add a bunch of like synthetic data and like supervised fine tuning, um, stuff like that to make it really like controllable and robust. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:07:48]: Yeah. We just have flow from Lindy and, uh, their Lindy started to like hallucinate recrolling YouTube links instead of like, uh, something. Yeah. Support guide. So. Oh, interesting. Yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:07:57]: So round about January, you announced your series A and renamed to Exo. I didn't like the name at the, at the initial, but it's grown on me. I liked metaphor, but apparently people can spell metaphor. What would you say are the major components of Exo today? Right? Like, I feel like it used to be very model heavy. Then at the AI engineer conference, Shreyas gave a really good talk on the vector database that you guys have. What are the other major moving parts of Exo? Okay.\n\nWill [00:08:23]: So Exo overall is a search engine. Yeah. We're trying to make it like a perfect search engine. And to do that, you have to build lots of, and we're doing it from scratch, right? So to do that, you have to build lots of different. The crawler. Yeah. You have to crawl a bunch of the web. First of all, you have to find the URLs to crawl. Uh, it's connected to the crawler, but yeah, you find URLs, you crawl those URLs. Then you have to process them with some, you know, it could be an embedding model. It could be something more complex, but you need to take, you know, or like, you know, in the past it was like a keyword inverted index. Like you would process all these documents you gather into some processed index, and then you have to serve that. Uh, you had high throughput at low latency. And so that, and that's like the vector database. And so it's like the crawling system, the AI processing system, and then the serving system. Those are all like, you know, teams of like hundreds, maybe thousands of people at Google. Um, but for us, it's like one or two people each typically, but yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:09:13]: Can you explain the meaning of, uh, Exo, just the story 10 to the 16th, uh, 18, 18.\n\nWill [00:09:20]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. So. Exo means 10 to the 18th, which is in stark contrast to. To Google, which is 10 to the hundredth. Uh, we actually have these like awesome shirts that are like 10th to 18th is greater than 10th to the hundredth. Yeah, it's great. And it's great because it's provocative. It's like every engineer in Silicon Valley is like, what? No, it's not true. Um, like, yeah. And, uh, and then you, you ask them, okay, what does it actually mean? And like the creative ones will, will recognize it. But yeah, I mean, 10 to the 18th is better than 10 to the hundredth when it comes to search, because with search, you want like the actual list of, of things that match what you're asking for. You don't want like the whole web. You want to basically with search filter, the, like everything that humanity has ever created to exactly what you want. And so the idea is like smaller is better there. You want like the best 10th to the 18th and not the 10th to the hundredth. I'm like, one way to say this is like, you know how Google often says at the top, uh, like, you know, 30 million results found. And it's like crazy. Cause you're looking for like the first startups in San Francisco that work on hardware or something. And like, they're not 30 million results like that. What you want is like 325 results found. And those are all the results. That's what you really want with search. And that's, that's our vision. It's like, it just gives you. Perfectly what you asked for.\n\nSwyx [00:10:24]: We're recording this ahead of your launch. Uh, we haven't released, we haven't figured out the, the, the name of the launch yet, but what is the product that you're launching? I guess now that we're coinciding this podcast with. Yeah.\n\nWill [00:10:36]: So we've basically developed the next version of Exa, which is the ability to get a near perfect list of results of whatever you want. And what that means is you can make a complex query now to Exa, for example, startups working on hardware in SF, and then just get a huge list of all the things that match. And, you know, our goal is if there are 325 startups that match that we find you all of them. And this is just like, there's just like a new experience that's never existed before. It's really like, I don't know how you would go about that right now with current tools and you can apply this same type of like technology to anything. Like, let's say you want, uh, you want to find all the blog posts that talk about Alessio's podcast, um, that have come out in the past year. That is 30 million results. Yeah. Right.\n\nWill [00:11:24]: But that, I mean, that would, I'm sure that would be extremely useful to you guys. And like, I don't really know how you would get that full comprehensive list.\n\nSwyx [00:11:29]: I just like, how do you, well, there's so many questions with regards to how do you know it's complete, right? Cause you're saying there's only 30 million, 325, whatever. And then how do you do the semantic understanding that it might take, right? So working in hardware, like I might not use the words hardware. I might use the words robotics. I might use the words wearables. I might use like whatever. Yes. So yeah, just tell us more. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sure.\n\nWill [00:11:53]: So one aspect of this, it's a little subjective. So like certainly providing, you know, at some point we'll provide parameters to the user to like, you know, some sort of threshold to like, uh, gauge like, okay, like this is a cutoff. Like, this is actually not what I mean, because sometimes it's subjective and there needs to be a feedback loop. Like, oh, like it might give you like a few examples and you say, yeah, exactly. And so like, you're, you're kind of like creating a classifier on the fly, but like, that's ultimately how you solve the problem. So the subject, there's a subjectivity problem and then there's a comprehensiveness problem. Those are two different problems. So. Yeah. So you have the comprehensiveness problem. What you basically have to do is you have to put more compute into the query, into the search until you get the full comprehensiveness. Yeah. And I think there's an interesting point here, which is that not all queries are made equal. Some queries just like this blog post one might require scanning, like scavenging, like throughout the whole web in a way that just, just simply requires more compute. You know, at some point there's some amount of compute where you will just be comprehensive. You could imagine, for example, running GPT-4 over the internet. You could imagine running GPT-4 over the entire web and saying like, is this a blog post about Alessio's podcast, like, is this a blog post about Alessio's podcast? And then that would work, right? It would take, you know, a year, maybe cost like a million dollars, but, or many more, but, um, it would work. Uh, the point is that like, given sufficient compute, you can solve the query. And so it's really a question of like, how comprehensive do you want it given your compute budget? I think it's very similar to O1, by the way. And one way of thinking about what we built is like O1 for search, uh, because O1 is all about like, you know, some, some, some questions require more compute than others, and we'll put as much compute into the question as we need to solve it. So similarly with our search, we will put as much compute into the query in order to get comprehensiveness. Yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:13:33]: Does that mean you have like some kind of compute budget that I can specify? Yes. Yes. Okay. And like, what are the upper and lower bounds?\n\nWill [00:13:42]: Yeah, there's something we're still figuring out. I think like, like everyone is a new paradigm of like variable compute products. Yeah. How do you specify the amount of compute? Like what happens when you. Run out? Do you just like, ah, do you, can you like keep going with it? Like, do you just put in more credits to get more, um, for some, like this can get complex at like the really large compute queries. And like, one thing we do is we give you a preview of what you're going to get, and then you could then spin up like a much larger job, uh, to get like way more results. But yes, there is some compute limit, um, at, at least right now. Yeah. People think of searches as like, oh, it takes 500 milliseconds because we've been conditioned, uh, to have search that takes 500 milliseconds. But like search engines like Google, right. No matter how complex your query to Google, it will take like, you know, roughly 400 milliseconds. But what if searches can take like a minute or 10 minutes or a whole day, what can you then do? And you can do very powerful things. Um, you know, you can imagine, you know, writing a search, going and get a cup of coffee, coming back and you have a perfect list. Like that's okay for a lot of use cases. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:14:43]: Yeah. I mean, the use case closest to me is venture capital, right? So, uh, no, I mean, eight years ago, I built one of the first like data driven sourcing platforms. So we were. You look at GitHub, Twitter, Product Hunt, all these things, look at interesting things, evaluate them. If you think about some jobs that people have, it's like literally just make a list. If you're like an analyst at a venture firm, your job is to make a list of interesting companies. And then you reach out to them. How do you think about being infrastructure versus like a product you could say, Hey, this is like a product to find companies. This is a product to find things versus like offering more as a blank canvas that people can build on top of. Oh, right. Right.\n\nWill [00:15:20]: Uh, we are. We are a search infrastructure company. So we want people to build, uh, on top of us, uh, build amazing products on top of us. But with this one, we try to build something that makes it really easy for users to just log in, put a few, you know, put some credits in and just get like amazing results right away and not have to wait to build some API integration. So we're kind of doing both. Uh, we, we want, we want people to integrate this into all their applications at the same time. We want to just make it really easy to use very similar again to open AI. Like they'll have, they have an API, but they also have. Like a ChatGPT interface so that you could, it's really easy to use, but you could also build it in your applications. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:15:56]: I'm still trying to wrap my head around a lot of the implications. So, so many businesses run on like information arbitrage, you know, like I know this thing that you don't, especially in investment and financial services. So yeah, now all of a sudden you have these tools for like, oh, actually everybody can get the same information at the same time, the same quality level as an API call. You know, it just kind of changes a lot of things. Yeah.\n\nWill [00:16:19]: I think, I think what we're grappling with here. What, what you're just thinking about is like, what is the world like if knowledge is kind of solved, if like any knowledge request you want is just like right there on your computer, it's kind of different from when intelligence is solved. There's like a good, I've written before about like a different super intelligence, super knowledge. Yeah. Like I think that the, the distinction between intelligence and knowledge is actually a pretty good one. They're definitely connected and related in all sorts of ways, but there is a distinction. You could have a world and we are going to have this world where you have like GP five level systems and beyond that could like answer any complex request. Um, unless it requires some. Like, if you say like, uh, you know, give me a list of all the PhDs in New York city who, I don't know, have thought about search before. And even though this, this super intelligence is going to be like, I can't find it on Google, right. Which is kind of crazy. Like we're literally going to have like super intelligences that are using Google. And so if Google can't find them information, there's nothing they could do. They can't find it. So, but if you also have a super knowledge system where it's like, you know, I'm calling this term super knowledge where you just get whatever knowledge you want, then you can pair with a super intelligence system. And then the super intelligence can, we'll never. Be blocked by lack of knowledge.\n\nAlessio [00:17:23]: Yeah. You told me this, uh, when we had lunch, I forget how it came out, but we were talking about AGI and whatnot. And you were like, even AGI is going to need search. Yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:17:32]: Yeah. Right. Yeah. Um, so we're actually referencing a blog post that you wrote super intelligence and super knowledge. Uh, so I would refer people to that. And this is actually a discussion we've had on the podcast a couple of times. Um, there's so much of model weights that are just memorizing facts. Some of the, some of those might be outdated. Some of them are incomplete or not. Yeah. So like you just need search. So I do wonder, like, is there a maximum language model size that will be the intelligence layer and then the rest is just search, right? Like maybe we should just always use search. And then that sort of workhorse model is just like, and it like, like, like one B or three B parameter model that just drives everything. Yes.\n\nWill [00:18:13]: I believe this is a much more optimal system to have a smaller LM. That's really just like an intelligence module. And it makes a call to a search. Tool that's way more efficient because if, okay, I mean the, the opposite of that would be like the LM is so big that can memorize the whole web. That would be like way, but you know, it's not practical at all. I don't, it's not possible to train that at least right now. And Carpathy has actually written about this, how like he could, he could see models moving more and more towards like intelligence modules using various tools. Yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:18:39]: So for listeners, that's the, that was him on the no priors podcast. And for us, we talked about this and the, on the Shin Yu and Harrison chase podcasts. I'm doing search in my head. I told you 30 million results. I forgot about our neural link integration. Self-hosted exit.\n\nWill [00:18:54]: Yeah. Yeah. No, I do see that that is a much more, much more efficient world. Yeah. I mean, you could also have GB four level systems calling search, but it's just because of the cost of inference. It's just better to have a very efficient search tool and a very efficient LM and they're built for different things. Yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:19:09]: I'm just kind of curious. Like it is still something so audacious that I don't want to elide, which is you're, you're, you're building a search engine. Where do you start? How do you, like, are there any reference papers or implementation? That would really influence your thinking, anything like that? Because I don't even know where to start apart from just crawl a bunch of shit, but there's gotta be more insight than that.\n\nWill [00:19:28]: I mean, yeah, there's more insight, but I'm always surprised by like, if you have a group of people who are really focused on solving a problem, um, with the tools today, like there's some in, in software, like there are all sorts of creative solutions that just haven't been thought of before, particularly in the information retrieval field. Yeah. I think a lot of the techniques are just very old, frankly. Like I know how Google and Bing work and. They're just not using new methods. There are all sorts of reasons for that. Like one, like Google has to be comprehensive over the web. So they're, and they have to return in 400 milliseconds. And those two things combined means they are kind of limit and it can't cost too much. They're kind of limited in, uh, what kinds of algorithms they could even deploy at scale. So they end up using like a limited keyword based algorithm. Also like Google was built in a time where like in, you know, in 1998, where we didn't have LMS, we didn't have embeddings. And so they never thought to build those things. And so now they have this like gigantic system that is built on old technology. Yeah. And so a lot of the information retrieval field we found just like thinks in terms of that framework. Yeah. Whereas we came in as like newcomers just thinking like, okay, there here's GB three. It's magical. Obviously we're going to build search that is using that technology. And we never even thought about using keywords really ever. Uh, like we were neural all the way we're building an end to end neural search engine. And just that whole framing just makes us ask different questions, like pursue different lines of work. And there's just a lot of low hanging fruit because no one else is thinking about it. We're just on the frontier of neural search. We just are, um, for, for at web scale, um, because there's just not a lot of people thinking that way about it.\n\nSwyx [00:20:57]: Yeah. Maybe let's spell this out since, uh, we're already on this topic, elephants in the room are Perplexity and SearchGPT. That's the, I think that it's all, it's no longer called SearchGPT. I think they call it ChatGPT Search. How would you contrast your approaches to them based on what we know of how they work and yeah, just any, anything in that, in that area? Yeah.\n\nWill [00:21:15]: So these systems, there are a few of them now, uh, they basically rely on like traditional search engines like Google or Bing, and then they combine them with like LLMs at the end to, you know, output some power graphics, uh, answering your question. So they like search GPT perplexity. I think they have their own crawlers. No. So there's this important distinction between like having your own search system and like having your own cache of the web. Like for example, so you could create, you could crawl a bunch of the web. Imagine you crawl a hundred billion URLs, and then you create a key value store of like mapping from URL to the document that is technically called an index, but it's not a search algorithm. So then to actually like, when you make a query to search GPT, for example, what is it actually doing it? Let's say it's, it's, it could, it's using the Bing API, uh, getting a list of results and then it could go, it has this cache of like all the contents of those results and then could like bring in the cache, like the index cache, but it's not actually like, it's not like they've built a search engine from scratch over, you know, hundreds of billions of pages. It's like, does that distinction clear? It's like, yeah, you could have like a mapping from URL to documents, but then rely on traditional search engines to actually get the list of results because it's a very hard problem to take. It's not hard. It's not hard to use DynamoDB and, and, and map URLs to documents. It's a very hard problem to take a hundred billion or more documents and given a query, like instantly get the list of results that match. That's a much harder problem that very few entities on, in, on the planet have done. Like there's Google, there's Bing, uh, you know, there's Yandex, but you know, there are not that many companies that are, that are crazy enough to actually build their search engine from scratch when you could just use traditional search APIs.\n\nAlessio [00:22:43]: So Google had PageRank as like the big thing. Is there a LLM equivalent or like any. Stuff that you're working on that you want to highlight?\n\nWill [00:22:51]: The link prediction objective can be seen as like a neural PageRank because what you're doing is you're predicting the links people share. And so if everyone is sharing some Paul Graham essay about fundraising, then like our model is more likely to predict it. So like inherent in our training objective is this, uh, a sense of like high canonicity and like high quality, but it's more powerful than PageRank. It's strictly more powerful because people might refer to that Paul Graham fundraising essay in like a thousand different ways. And so our model learns all the different ways. That someone refers that Paul Graham, I say, while also learning how important that Paul Graham essay is. Um, so it's like, it's like PageRank on steroids kind of thing. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:23:26]: I think to me, that's the most interesting thing about search today, like with Google and whatnot, it's like, it's mostly like domain authority. So like if you get back playing, like if you search any AI term, you get this like SEO slop websites with like a bunch of things in them. So this is interesting, but then how do you think about more timeless maybe content? So if you think about, yeah. You know, maybe the founder mode essay, right. It gets shared by like a lot of people, but then you might have a lot of other essays that are also good, but they just don't really get a lot of traction. Even though maybe the people that share them are high quality. How do you kind of solve that thing when you don't have the people authority, so to speak of who's sharing, whether or not they're worth kind of like bumping up? Yeah.\n\nWill [00:24:10]: I mean, you do have a lot of control over the training data, so you could like make sure that the training data contains like high quality sources so that, okay. Like if you, if you're. Training data, I mean, it's very similar to like language, language model training. Like if you train on like a bunch of crap, your prediction will be crap. Our model will match the training distribution is trained on. And so we could like, there are lots of ways to tweak the training data to refer to high quality content that we want. Yeah. I would say also this, like this slop that is returned by, by traditional search engines, like Google and Bing, you have the slop is then, uh, transferred into the, these LLMs in like a search GBT or, you know, our other systems like that. Like if slop comes in, slop will go out. And so, yeah, that's another answer to how we're different is like, we're not like traditional search engines. We want to give like the highest quality results and like have full control over whatever you want. If you don't want slop, you get that. And then if you put an LM on top of that, which our customers do, then you just get higher quality results or high quality output.\n\nAlessio [00:25:06]: And I use Excel search very often and it's very good. Especially.\n\nSwyx [00:25:09]: Wave uses it too.\n\nAlessio [00:25:10]: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like the slop is everywhere, especially when it comes to AI, when it comes to investment. When it comes to all of these things for like, it's valuable to be at the top. And this problem is only going to get worse because. Yeah, no, it's totally. What else is in the toolkit? So you have search API, you have ExaSearch, kind of like the web version. Now you have the list builder. I think you also have web scraping. Maybe just touch on that. Like, I guess maybe people, they want to search and then they want to scrape. Right. So is that kind of the use case that people have? Yeah.\n\nWill [00:25:41]: A lot of our customers, they don't just want, because they're building AI applications on top of Exa, they don't just want a list of URLs. They actually want. Like the full content, like cleans, parsed. Markdown. Markdown, maybe chunked, whatever they want, we'll give it to them. And so that's been like huge for customers. Just like getting the URLs and instantly getting the content for each URL is like, and you can do this for 10 or 100 or 1,000 URLs, wherever you want. That's very powerful.\n\nSwyx [00:26:05]: Yeah. I think this is the first thing I asked you for when I tried using Exa.\n\nWill [00:26:09]: Funny story is like when I built the first version of Exa, it's like, we just happened to store the content. Yes. Like the first 1,024 tokens. Because I just kind of like kept it because I thought of, you know, I don't know why. Really for debugging purposes. And so then when people started asking for content, it was actually pretty easy to serve it. But then, and then we did that, like Exa took off. So the computer's content was so useful. So that was kind of cool.\n\nSwyx [00:26:30]: It is. I would say there are other players like Gina, I think is in this space. Firecrawl is in this space. There's a bunch of scraper companies. And obviously scraper is just one part of your stack, but you might as well offer it since you already do it.\n\nWill [00:26:43]: Yeah, it makes sense. It's just easy to have an all-in-one solution. And like. We are, you know, building the best scraper in the world. So scraping is a hard problem and it's easy to get like, you know, a good scraper. It's very hard to get a great scraper and it's super hard to get a perfect scraper. So like, and, and scraping really matters to people. Do you have a perfect scraper? Not yet. Okay.\n\nSwyx [00:27:05]: The web is increasingly closing to the bots and the scrapers, Twitter, Reddit, Quora, Stack Overflow. I don't know what else. How are you dealing with that? How are you navigating those things? Like, you know. You know, opening your eyes, like just paying them money.\n\nWill [00:27:19]: Yeah, no, I mean, I think it definitely makes it harder for search engines. One response is just that there's so much value in the long tail of sites that are open. Okay. Um, and just like, even just searching over those well gets you most of the value. But I mean, there, there is definitely a lot of content that is increasingly not unavailable. And so you could get through that through data partnerships. The bigger we get as a company, the more, the easier it is to just like, uh, make partnerships. But I, I mean, I do see the world as like the future where the. The data, the, the data producers, the content creators will make partnerships with the entities that find that data.\n\nAlessio [00:27:53]: Any other fun use case that maybe people are not thinking about? Yeah.\n\nWill [00:27:58]: Oh, I mean, uh, there are so many customers. Yeah. What are people doing on AXA? Well, I think dating is a really interesting, uh, application of search that is completely underserved because there's a lot of profiles on the web and a lot of people who want to find love and that I'll use it. They give me. Like, you know, age boundaries, you know, education level location. Yeah. I mean, you want to, what, what do you want to do with data? You want to find like a partner who matches this education level, who like, you know, maybe has written about these types of topics before. Like if you could get a list of all the people like that, like, I think you will unblock a lot of people. I mean, there, I mean, I think this is a very Silicon Valley view of dating for sure. And I'm, I'm well aware of that, but it's just an interesting application of like, you know, I would love to meet like an intellectual partner, um, who like shares a lot of ideas. Yeah. Like if you could do that through better search and yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:28:48]: But what is it with Jeff? Jeff has already set me up with a few people. So like Jeff, I think it's my personal exit.\n\nWill [00:28:55]: my mom's actually a matchmaker and has got a lot of married. Yeah. No kidding. Yeah. Yeah. Search is built into the book. It's in your jeans. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:29:02]: Yeah. Other than dating, like I know you're having quite some success in colleges. I would just love to map out some more use cases so that our listeners can just use those examples to think about use cases for XR, right? Because it's such a general technology that it's hard to. Uh, really pin down, like, what should I use it for and what kind of products can I build with it?\n\nWill [00:29:20]: Yeah, sure. So, I mean, there are so many applications of XR and we have, you know, many, many companies using us for very diverse range of use cases, but I'll just highlight some interesting ones. Like one customer, a big customer is using us to, um, basically build like a, a writing assistant for students who want to write, uh, research papers. And basically like XR will search for, uh, like a list of research papers related to what the student is writing. And then this product has. Has like an LLM that like summarizes the papers to basically it's like a next word prediction, but in, uh, you know, prompted by like, you know, 20 research papers that X has returned. It's like literally just doing their homework for them. Yeah. Yeah. the key point is like, it's, it's, uh, you know, it's, it's, you know, research is, is a really hard thing to do and you need like high quality content as input.\n\nSwyx [00:30:08]: Oh, so we've had illicit on the podcast. I think it's pretty similar. Uh, they, they do focus pretty much on just, just research papers and, and that research. Basically, I think dating, uh, research, like I just wanted to like spell out more things, like just the big verticals.\n\nWill [00:30:23]: Yeah, yeah, no, I mean, there, there are so many use cases. So finance we talked about, yeah. I mean, one big vertical is just finding a list of companies, uh, so it's useful for VCs, like you said, who want to find like a list of competitors to a specific company they're investigating or just a list of companies in some field. Like, uh, there was one VC that told me that him and his team, like we're using XR for like eight hours straight. Like, like that. For many days on end, just like, like, uh, doing like lots of different queries of different types, like, oh, like all the companies in AI for law or, uh, all the companies for AI for, uh, construction and just like getting lists of things because you just can't find this information with, with traditional search engines. And then, you know, finding companies is also useful for, for selling. If you want to find, you know, like if we want to find a list of, uh, writing assistants to sell to, then we can just, we just use XR ourselves to find that is actually how we found a lot of our customers. Ooh, you can find your own customers using XR. Oh my God. I, in the spirit of. Uh, using XR to bolster XR, like recruiting is really helpful. It is really great use case of XR, um, because we can just get like a list of, you know, people who thought about search and just get like a long list and then, you know, reach out to those people.\n\nSwyx [00:31:29]: When you say thought about, are you, are you thinking LinkedIn, Twitter, or are you thinking just blogs?\n\nWill [00:31:33]: Or they've written, I mean, it's pretty general. So in that case, like ideally XR would return like the, the really blogs written by people who have just. So if I don't blog, I don't show up to XR, right? Like I have to blog. well, I mean, you could show up. That's like an incentive for people to blog.\n\nSwyx [00:31:47]: Well, if you've written about, uh, search in on Twitter and we, we do, we do index a bunch of tweets and then we, we should be able to service that. Yeah. Um, I mean, this is something I tell people, like you have to make yourself discoverable to the web, uh, you know, it's called learning in public, but like, it's even more imperative now because otherwise you don't exist at all.\n\nWill [00:32:07]: Yeah, no, no, this is a huge, uh, thing, which is like search engines completely influence. They have downstream effects. They influence the internet itself. They influence what people. Choose to create. And so Google, because they're a keyword based search engine, people like kind of like keyword stuff. Yeah. They're, they're, they're incentivized to create things that just match a lot of keywords, which is not very high quality. Uh, whereas XR is a search algorithm that, uh, optimizes for like high quality and actually like matching what you mean. And so people are incentivized to create content that is high quality, that like the create content that they know will be found by the right person. So like, you know, if I am a search researcher and I want to be found. By XR, I should blog about search and all the things I'm building because, because now we have a search engine like XR that's powerful enough to find them. And so the search engine will influence like the downstream internet in all sorts of amazing ways. Yeah. Uh, whatever the search engine optimizes for is what the internet looks like. Yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:33:01]: Are you familiar with the term? McLuhanism? No, it's not. Uh, it's this concept that, uh, like first we shape tools and then the tools shape us. Okay. Yeah. Uh, so there's like this reflexive connection between the things we search for and the things that get searched. Yes. So like once you change the tool. The tool that searches the, the, the things that get searched also change. Yes.\n\nWill [00:33:18]: I mean, there was a clear example of that with 30 years of Google. Yeah, exactly. Google has basically trained us to think of search and Google has Google is search like in people's heads. Right. It's one, uh, hard part about XR is like, uh, ripping people away from that notion of search and expanding their sense of what search could be. Because like when people think search, they think like a few keywords, or at least they used to, they think of a few keywords and that's it. They don't think to make these like really complex paragraph long requests for information and get a perfect list. ChatGPT was an interesting like thing that expanded people's understanding of search because you start using ChatGPT for a few hours and you go back to Google and you like paste in your code and Google just doesn't work and you're like, oh, wait, it, Google doesn't do work that way. So like ChatGPT expanded our understanding of what search can be. And I think XR is, uh, is part of that. We want to expand people's notion, like, Hey, you could actually get whatever you want. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:34:06]: I search on XR right now, people writing about learning in public. I was like, is it gonna come out with Alessio? Am I, am I there? You're not because. Bro. It's. So, no, it's, it's so about, because it thinks about learning, like in public, like public schools and like focuses more on that. You know, it's like how, when there are like these highly overlapping things, like this is like a good result based on the query, you know, but like, how do I get to Alessio? Right. So if you're like in these subcultures, I don't think this would work in Google well either, you know, but I, I don't know if you have any learnings.\n\nSwyx [00:34:40]: No, I'm the first result on Google.\n\nAlessio [00:34:42]: People writing about learning. In public, you're not first result anymore, I guess.\n\nSwyx [00:34:48]: Just type learning public in Google.\n\nAlessio [00:34:49]: Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But this is also like, this is in Google, it doesn't work either. That's what I'm saying. It's like how, when you have like a movement.\n\nWill [00:34:56]: There's confusion about the, like what you mean, like your intention is a little, uh. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:35:00]: It's like, yeah, I'm using, I'm using a term that like I didn't invent, but I'm kind of taking over, but like, they're just so much about that term already that it's hard to overcome. If that makes sense, because public schools is like, well, it's, it's hard to overcome.\n\nWill [00:35:14]: Public schools, you know, so there's the right solution to this, which is to specify more clearly what you mean. And I'm not expecting you to do that, but so the, the right interface to search is actually an LLM.\n\nSwyx [00:35:25]: Like you should be talking to an LLM about what you want and the LLM translates its knowledge of you or knowledge of what people usually mean into a query that excellent uses, which you have called auto prompts, right?\n\nWill [00:35:35]: Or, yeah, but it's like a very light version of that. And really it's just basically the right answer is it's the wrong interface and like very soon interface to search and really to everything will be LLM. And the LLM just has a full knowledge of you, right? So we're kind of building for that world. We're skating to where the puck is going to be. And so since we're moving to a world where like LLMs are interfaced to everything, you should build a search engine that can handle complex LLM queries, queries that come from LLMs. Because you're probably too lazy, I'm too lazy too, to write like a whole paragraph explaining, okay, this is what I mean by this word. But an LLM is not lazy. And so like the LLM will spit out like a paragraph or more explaining exactly what it wants. You need a search engine that can handle that. Traditional search engines like Google or Bing, they're actually... Designed for humans typing keywords. If you give a paragraph to Google or Bing, they just completely fail. And so Exa can handle paragraphs and we want to be able to handle it more and more until it's like perfect.\n\nAlessio [00:36:24]: What about opinions? Do you have lists? When you think about the list product, do you think about just finding entries? Do you think about ranking entries? I'll give you a dumb example. So on Lindy, I've been building the spot that every week gives me like the top fantasy football waiver pickups. But every website is like different opinions. I'm like, you should pick up. These five players, these five players. When you're making lists, do you want to be kind of like also ranking and like telling people what's best? Or like, are you mostly focused on just surfacing information?\n\nWill [00:36:56]: There's a really good distinction between filtering to like things that match your query and then ranking based on like what is like your preferences. And ranking is like filtering is objective. It's like, does this document match what you asked for? Whereas ranking is more subjective. It's like, what is the best? Well, it depends what you mean by best, right? So first, first table stakes is let's get the filtering into a perfect place where you actually like every document matches what you asked for. No surgeon can do that today. And then ranking, you know, there are all sorts of interesting ways to do that where like you've maybe for, you know, have the user like specify more clearly what they mean by best. You could do it. And if the user doesn't specify, you do your best, you do your best based on what people typically mean by best. But ideally, like the user can specify, oh, when I mean best, I actually mean ranked by the, you know, the number of people who visited that site. Let's say is, is one example ranking or, oh, what I mean by best, let's say you're listing companies. What I mean by best is like the ones that have, uh, you know, have the most employees or something like that. Like there are all sorts of ways to rank a list of results that are not captured by something as subjective as best. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:38:00]: I mean, it's like, who are the best NBA players in the history? It's like everybody has their own. Right.\n\nWill [00:38:06]: Right. But I mean, the, the, the search engine should definitely like, even if you don't specify it, it should do as good of a job as possible. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, totally. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a new topic to people because we're not used to a search engine that can handle like a very complex ranking system. Like you think to type in best basketball players and not something more specific because you know, that's the only thing Google could handle. But if Google could handle like, oh, basketball players ranked by like number of shots scored on average per game, then you would do that. But you know, they can't do that. So.\n\nSwyx [00:38:32]: Yeah. That's fascinating. So you haven't used the word agents, but you're kind of building a search agent. Do you believe that that is agentic in feature? Do you think that term is distracting?\n\nWill [00:38:42]: I think it's a good term. I do think everything will eventually become agentic. And so then the term will lose power, but yes, like what we're building is agentic it in a sense that it takes actions. It decides when to go deeper into something, it has a loop, right? It feels different from traditional search, which is like an algorithm, not an agent. Ours is a combination of an algorithm and an agent.\n\nSwyx [00:39:05]: I think my reflection from seeing this in the coding space where there's basically sort of classic. Framework for thinking about this stuff is the self-driving levels of autonomy, right? Level one to five, typically the level five ones all failed because there's full autonomy and we're not, we're not there yet. And people like control. People like to be in the loop. So the, the, the level ones was co-pilot first and now it's like cursor and whatever. So I feel like if it's too agentic, it's too magical, like, like a, like a one shot, I stick a, stick a paragraph into the text box and then it spits it back to me. It might feel like I'm too disconnected from the process and I don't trust it. As opposed to something where I'm more intimately involved with the research product. I see. So like, uh, wait, so the earlier versions are, so if trying to stick to the example of the basketball thing, like best basketball player, but instead of best, you, you actually get to customize it with like, whatever the metric is that you, you guys care about. Yeah. I'm still not a basketballer, but, uh, but, but, you know, like, like B people like to be in my, my thesis is that agents level five agents failed because people like to. To kind of have drive assist rather than full self-driving.\n\nWill [00:40:15]: I mean, a lot of this has to do with how good agents are. Like at some point, if agents for coding are better than humans at all tests and then humans block, yeah, we're not there yet.\n\nSwyx [00:40:25]: So like in a world where we're not there yet, what you're pitching us is like, you're, you're kind of saying you're going all the way there. Like I kind of, I think all one is also very full, full self-driving. You don't get to see the plan. You don't get to affect the plan yet. You just fire off a query and then it goes away for a couple of minutes and comes back. Right. Which is effectively what you're saying you're going to do too. And you think there's.\n\nWill [00:40:42]: There's a, there's an in-between. I saw. Okay. So in building this product, we're exploring new interfaces because what does it mean to kick off a search that goes and takes 10 minutes? Like, is that a good interface? Because what if the search is actually wrong or it's not exactly, exactly specified to what you mean, which is why you get previews. Yeah. You get previews. So it is iterative, but ultimately once you've specified exactly what you mean, then you kind of do just want to kick off a batch job. Right. So perhaps what you're getting at is like, uh, there's this barrier with agents where you have to like explain the full context of what you mean, and a lot of failure modes happen when you have, when you don't. Yeah. There's failure modes from the agent, just not being smart enough. And then there's failure modes from the agent, not understanding exactly what you mean. And there's a lot of context that is shared between humans that is like lost between like humans and, and this like new creature.\n\nAlessio [00:41:32]: Yeah. Yeah. Because people don't know what's going on. I mean, to me, the best example of like system prompts is like, why are you writing? You're a helpful assistant. Like. Of course you should be an awful, but people don't yet know, like, can I assume that, you know, that, you know, it's like, why did the, and now people write, oh, you're a very smart software engineer, but like, you never made, you never make mistakes. Like, were you going to try and make mistakes before? So I think people don't yet have an understanding, like with, with driving people know what good driving is. It's like, don't crash, stay within kind of like a certain speed range. It's like, follow the directions. It's like, I don't really have to explain all of those things. I hope. But with. AI and like models and like search, people are like, okay, what do you actually know? What are like your assumptions about how search, how you're going to do search? And like, can I trust it? You know, can I influence it? So I think that's kind of the, the middle ground, like before you go ahead and like do all the search, it's like, can I see how you're doing it? And then maybe help show your work kind of like, yeah, steer you. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nWill [00:42:32]: No, I mean, yeah. Sure. Saying, even if you've crafted a great system prompt, you want to be part of the process itself. Uh, because the system prompt doesn't, it doesn't capture everything. Right. So yeah. A system prompt is like, you get to choose the person you work with. It's like, oh, like I want, I want a software engineer who thinks this way about code. But then even once you've chosen that person, you can't just give them a high level command and they go do it perfectly. You have to be part of that process. So yeah, I agree.\n\nSwyx [00:42:58]: Just a side note for my system, my favorite system, prompt programming anecdote now is the Apple intelligence system prompt that someone, someone's a prompt injected it and seen it. And like the Apple. Intelligence has the words, like, please don't, don't hallucinate. And it's like, of course we don't want you to hallucinate. Right. Like, so it's exactly that, that what you're talking about, like we should train this behavior into the model, but somehow we still feel the need to inject into the prompt. And I still don't even think that we are very scientific about it. Like it, I think it's almost like cargo culting. Like we have this like magical, like turn around three times, throw salt over your shoulder before you do something. And like, it worked the last time. So let's just do it the same time now. And like, we do, there's no science to this.\n\nWill [00:43:35]: I do think a lot of these problems might be ironed out in future versions. Right. So, and like, they might, they might hide the details from you. So it's like, they actually, all of them have a system prompt. That's like, you are a helpful assistant. You don't actually have to include it, even though it might actually be the way they've implemented in the backend. It should be done in RLE AF.\n\nSwyx [00:43:52]: Okay. Uh, one question I was just kind of curious about this episode is I'm going to try to frame this in terms of this, the general AI search wars, you know, you're, you're one player in that, um, there's perplexity, chat, GPT, search, and Google, but there's also like the B2B side, uh, we had. Drew Houston from Dropbox on, and he's competing with Glean, who've, uh, we've also had DD from, from Glean on, is there an appetite for Exa for my company's documents?\n\nWill [00:44:19]: There is appetite, but I think we have to be disciplined, focused, disciplined. I mean, we're already taking on like perfect web search, which is a lot. Um, but I mean, ultimately we want to build a perfect search engine, which definitely for a lot of queries involves your, your personal information, your company's information. And so, yeah, I mean, the grandest vision of Exa is perfect search really over everything, every domain, you know, we're going to have an Exa satellite, uh, because, because satellites can gather information that, uh, is not available publicly. Uh, gotcha. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:44:51]: Can we talk about AGI? We never, we never talk about AGI, but you had, uh, this whole tweet about, oh, one being the biggest kind of like AI step function towards it. Why does it feel so important to you? I know there's kind of like always criticism and saying, Hey, it's not the smartest son is better. It's like, blah, blah, blah. What? You choose C. So you say, this is what Ilias see or Sam see what they will see.\n\nWill [00:45:13]: I've just, I've just, you know, been connecting the dots. I mean, this was the key thing that a bunch of labs were working on, which is like, can you create a reward signal? Can you teach yourself based on a reward signal? Whether you're, if you're trying to learn coding or math, if you could have one model say, uh, be a grading system that says like you have successfully solved this programming assessment and then one model, like be the generative system. That's like, here are a bunch of programming assessments. You could train on that. It's basically whenever you could create a reward signal for some task, you could just generate a bunch of tasks for yourself. See that like, oh, on two of these thousand, you did well. And then you just train on that data. It's basically like, I mean, creating your own data for yourself and like, you know, all the labs working on that opening, I built the most impressive product doing that. And it's just very, it's very easy now to see how that could like scale to just solving, like, like solving programming or solving mathematics, which sounds crazy, but everything about our world right now is crazy.\n\nAlessio [00:46:07]: Um, and so I think if you remove that whole, like, oh, that's impossible, and you just think really clearly about like, what's now possible with like what, what they've done with O1, it's easy to see how that scales. How do you think about older GPT models then? Should people still work on them? You know, if like, obviously they just had the new Haiku, like, is it even worth spending time, like making these models better versus just, you know, Sam talked about O2 at that day. So obviously they're, they're spending a lot of time in it, but then you have maybe. The GPU poor, which are still working on making Lama good. Uh, and then you have the follower labs that do not have an O1 like model out yet. Yeah.\n\nWill [00:46:47]: This kind of gets into like, uh, what will the ecosystem of, of models be like in the future? And is there room is, is everything just gonna be O1 like models? I think, well, I mean, there's definitely a question of like inference speed and if certain things like O1 takes a long time, because that's the thing. Well, I mean, O1 is, is two things. It's like one it's it's use it's bootstrapping itself. It's teaching itself. And so the base model is smarter. But then it also has this like inference time compute where it could like spend like many minutes or many hours thinking. And so even the base model, which is also fast, it doesn't have to take minutes. It could take is, is better, smarter. I believe all models will be trained with this paradigm. Like you'll want to train on the best data, but there will be many different size models from different, very many different like companies, I believe. Yeah. Because like, I don't, yeah, I mean, it's hard, hard to predict, but I don't think opening eye is going to dominate like every possible LLM for every possible. Use case. I think for a lot of things, like you just want the fastest model and that might not involve O1 methods at all.\n\nSwyx [00:47:42]: I would say if you were to take the exit being O1 for search, literally, you really need to prioritize search trajectories, like almost maybe paying a bunch of grad students to go research things. And then you kind of track what they search and what the sequence of searching is, because it seems like that is the gold mine here, like the chain of thought or the thinking trajectory. Yeah.\n\nWill [00:48:05]: When it comes to search, I've always been skeptical. I've always been skeptical of human labeled data. Okay. Yeah, please. We tried something at our company at Exa recently where me and a bunch of engineers on the team like labeled a bunch of queries and it was really hard. Like, you know, you have all these niche queries and you're looking at a bunch of results and you're trying to identify which is matched to query. It's talking about, you know, the intricacies of like some biological experiment or something. I have no idea. Like, I don't know what matches and what, what labelers like me tend to do is just match by keyword. I'm like, oh, I don't know. Oh, like this document matches a bunch of keywords, so it must be good. But then you're actually completely missing the meaning of the document. Whereas an LLM like GB4 is really good at labeling. And so I actually think like you just we get by, which we are right now doing using like LLMs as the labelers specifically for search. I think it's interesting. It's different between like search and like GB5 are different because GB5 might benefit from training on a lot of PhD notes because like GB5 might have to do like very, very complex, like, uh, problem-solving in after when it was given an input, but with search, it's actually a very different problem. You're, you're asking simple questions about billions of things. So like, whereas like GB5 is asking a really hard, it's like solving a really hard question, but it's one, it's like one question, a PhD level question with search. You're asking like simple questions about billions of things. Like, is this a startup? Did this person write a blog post about search? You know, those are actually simple questions. You don't need like PhD level training data. Does that make sense? Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:49:33]: What else we got here? Uh, nap pods. Oh, yeah.\n\nSwyx [00:49:38]: What's the, yeah. So like just generally, I think, uh, EXA has a very interesting company building vibe. Like you, you have a meme Lord CTO, um, I guess, I don't know. Like, and, and you, you have, you just generally, um, are counter consensus in a bunch of things. What is the culture at EXA?\n\nWill [00:49:59]: Like, yeah, I, me and Jeff are, I mean, we've been best friends. It's like, like we met, like met like first day of college. I've been best friends ever since. And we have a really good vibe. I think that's like intense, but also really fun. And like, like funny, honestly, we have a ton of like, we just laugh a lot, a ton at EXA. And I think that's just like, you see that in every part of our culture. We don't really care about how the world sees anything. Like me and Jeff are just like that. Like, we're just thinking really just like, like, what should we do here? Like, what do we need? And so in the nap pod case, it was like, people get tired a lot when they're coding or doing anything really. And like, why can't we just sleep here or, or like nap? And, uh, okay, if we need a nap, then we should get a nap pod. It's crazy to me that there aren't nap pods in lots of companies because like I get tired all the time. I take a nap like every other day, probably for like 20 minutes. I'm actually never actually napping. I'm just thinking about a problem, but closing my eyes really like, um, first of all, it makes me come up with more creative solutions. And then also actually it gives me some rest. So, which is awesome.\n\nSwyx [00:50:54]: Google was the original company that had the nap pods at work, right? Oh, okay.\n\nWill [00:50:56]: Well, then at one point Google was thinking for first principles and everything too. Um, and that was reflected in their nap pods.\n\nSwyx [00:51:02]: So you, you like, you like didn't just get a nap pod for your office. You like found something from China and you're like, who wants to get in on this? Let's get a container full of them. Yeah.\n\nWill [00:51:11]: Well, we're trying, we try to be frugal. So like we were, we were looking at like different nap pods. And then, uh, at some point we were like, wait, China probably has solved this problem. And so then we ordered it from China and then it was actually so heavy. Like when it came off the truck, it was like 500 pounds. And I like the truck was like having trouble, like putting it on the ground. And so like me and the delivery guy were like trying to hold it. And then we couldn't, we were struggling. So someone came out from on the street and like heart started helping us hurt yourself. I know it was really dangerous, but we did it. And then it was awesome.\n\nAlessio [00:51:37]: And it's funny. I was reading the tech crunch article about it. It was a tech crunch article on the nap pods. Yeah. And then Jeff explained, well, they quote Jeff and this paragraph says, so the nap pods maintain employees ability to stop work and sleep rather than the idea that in quotes, employees are slaves. Close quote, I don't know what I'm. I'm like, I'm sure there's not what event, you know, but I'm curious, like, just like how people there's always like this, I think for a little bit, it went away about like startups and kind of like hustle culture and like all of that.\n\nSwyx [00:52:10]: And I think now with AI, people are like, have all these feelings towards AI that are kind of like, I think it's a pro hustle culture, right? Yeah.\n\nWill [00:52:17]: But I mean, I mean, ideally the hustle is like people are just having fun, which is people, people are just having fun.\n\nAlessio [00:52:23]: Yeah. But I would say from the outside, it's like, people don't like it, you know, I'm saying people not in, in AI and kind of like intact. They're kind of like. Oh, these guys are at it again. These are like the same people that gave us underpaid drivers, like whatever it's like. So it was just funny to see somehow they wanted to make it sound like Jeff was saying employees are slaves, but like, oh, yeah, I don't know. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWill [00:52:45]: But yeah, I mean, okay. I can't imagine a more exciting experience than like building something from scratch. That's like a huge deal with a bunch of your friends. Our team is going to look back in 10 years and think this was like the most beautiful experience that you could have in life. And like. That's how I think about it. And yeah, that's just so it's not, it's not a hustle or not. It's like, is this like, like, does this satisfy your core desire to like build things in the world? And it does. Yeah.\n\nAlessio [00:53:10]: Anything else we didn't cover any parting thoughts? Are you hiring?\n\nWill [00:53:16]: Are you, obviously you're looking for more people to use it, but yeah, yeah, we're definitely hiring. We're, we're growing quite fast and we have a really smart team of engineers and researchers. And we now have a, we just purchased a $5 million H 200 cluster. So we have a lot more compute to play with. Do you run all your own inference? We do a mix of our cluster and like AWS inference that we, we use these are, so we have our current cluster, which is like a one hundreds and now we've updated the new one. We use it for training and research.\n\nSwyx [00:53:43]: What's the training versus inference budget? Like, is it like a, is it 50, 50? Is it?\n\nWill [00:53:48]: Yeah, we, there will be more inference for search for sure.\n\nSwyx [00:53:51]: The other thing I mentioned, so by the way, I'm like sidetracking, but I'm just kind of throwing this in there because I always think about the economics of AI search, like for those, I think, I think if you look up, there's the upper limit is going to be whatever you can monetize off of ads, right? So for Google, let's say it's like a one cent per thousand views, something like that. I don't know the exact number, the exact numbers floating around out there. That means that's your revenue, right? Then your cost has to be lower than that. And so at some point, like for an LLM inference call to be made for every page view, you need to get it lower than. The money that you would take in for, for that. And like, one of the things that I was very surprised, surprised for perplexity and character as well was that they couldn't get it so low that it would be reasonable. I think for you guys, it is a mix of front loading it by indexing. So you only run that compute like once a month, once a, once a quarter, whatever you do re-indexing. And then it's just a little bit more when you, when you do inference, when this search actually gets done, right? Like, so I think when people work out like the economics of such a business, they have to kind of think about where do you put the. The costs. Yes.\n\nWill [00:54:52]: Yes. I mean, uh, definitely you have to, you cannot run LLMs over the whole index, you know, billions of things at query time. So you have to pre-process things usually with LLMs, but then you, you can do a re-rank over like, you know, 10, 30, a hundred, depending on a thousand, depending on how. You know, you could, you could play with different sizes of L of transformers to get the cost to work out. I mean, one really interesting thing is like, we're building a search engine at a time where LLM costs are going down like crazy when some very useful. Tool goes down in cost by 200 X in like the space of, I don't know, a couple of years, there are going to be new opportunities in search, right? So like to, to not integrate this and build off, to not like rethink search from scratch, the search algorithm itself, given the fact that things are going down 200 X is crazy.\n\nAlessio [00:55:37]: Thank you so much for coming on, man. It was fun.",
      "# [Knowledge vs. Intelligence by Exa Labs](https://exa.ai/blog/superknowledge)\nThe most important technical problem\n\nIlya Sutskever thinks \"building safe superintelligence is the most important technical problem of our​​ time\".\n\nI disagree. I think there’s a more pressing technical problem, one that needs to be solved first – superknowledge.\n\nThe world is far shorter on knowledge than intelligence right now. We’ll soon have near-AGI intelligences (GPT-5) relying on knowledge systems built for humans in the late 1900s (Google).\n\nThis is an absurd situation, even a dangerous one.\n\nWe need to build superknowledge before superintelligence. Let’s explore why.\n\nIntelligence is bottlenecked by knowledge\n\nIntelligence is different from knowledge.\n\nIntelligence is reasoning over an input. Knowledge is retrieving from a data repository.\n\nAll the recent advanced AI models have high intelligence, but surprisingly limited knowledge.\n\nFor example, GPT-4 can nail any highschool physics problem, but if you ask it to retrieve a list of physics PhDs in NYC – a relatively simpler request – you get this:\n\nGPT-4 does have some knowledge of the world, but it isn’t anywhere close to knowing everything -- every phd webpage, every news article, blog post, youtube video, tweet, reddit post, meme, etc.\n\nThat's why LLMs are often combined with a search engine. The LLM brings the intelligence, and the search engine brings the knowledge. At least, in theory. Unfortunately today’s search engines can't handle simple knowledge requests either:\n\nKnowledge systems like Google haven't improved much over the past decade (arguably, they’ve gotten worse). In contrast, intelligence systems improve every month.\n\nThat means intelligence is increasingly bottlenecked by knowledge.\n\nLuckily, we now have technology like transformers, which enable radically new knowledge systems. That's what our team at Exa is working on. I believe we're only a few years away from building superknowledge.\n\nWhat is superknowledge?\n\nSuperintelligence is a system that can handle extremely complex reasoning requests.\n\nSuperknowledge is a system that can handle extremely complex retrieval requests.\n\nWe've achieved superknowledge when there exists an API that can handle any knowledge request over available information, no matter how complex.\n\nSuperknowledge would handle requests like:\n\n\"all physics PhDs in NYC\" (should return all 457 physics PhDs in NYC and any associated metadata)\n\n\"The org chart of every AI startup in the Bay Area started in the past 3 years sorted by employee count, where the founders have some experience training LLMs in pytorch\" (should return a perfect comprehensive list)\n\n\"All the apartments in SF that have a window facing a courtyard and air conditioning and don't have any reviews about smell complaints, sorted by price\" (if you happen to be superknowledgeable about this one plz DM me)\n\nIn short, superknowledge gives everyone comprehensive knowledge of anything as quickly as they want.\n\nI believe we urgently need this comprehensive knowledge, both to progress society and to safeguard it.\n\nSuperknowledge unblocks progress\n\nIf you want to accelerate human progress, superknowledge is perhaps the most overlooked way to do it.\n\nProgress is a constant cycle of learning what's out there and trying something new. Superknowledge eliminates any bottlenecks to the first step so that all energy can be focused on the second.\n\nDoctors would get a deep analysis of all previous studies involving similar symptoms before making their diagnosis\n\nAI researchers would instantly gather every experimental result related to any new idea they think up\n\nSoftware engineers would find every C++ project containing the code snippets they need\n\nJournalists would in real time see every fact that supports or negates what their interviewee states\n\nInvestors would never miss a climate tech opportunity that fits their portfolio\n\nArtists would find every modern painter in Denver who they should meet when they travel there\n\nSupply chain managers would identify the best possible supplier for every stage of the rocket assembly pipeline\n\nSuperknowledge would make us all superproductive and superinformed.\n\nIn our personal lives, much of our time is wasted searching -- for apartments, events, clothing, interesting articles, solutions to personal problems, etc. Superknowledge gathers all information for you in 2 seconds, not 2 days.\n\nSometimes we even waste not days, but months or years of our lives because we didn’t learn something existed until later – the perfect job opportunity, the right medical treatment. With superknowledge, you’d have a smart alert system so that you're fully in the know about any topic. No more \"I wish I knew that earlier\", for anything.\n\nProgress will accelerate most from combining superknowledge with an intelligence like GPT-5. GPT-5 can handle the planning and processing while superknowledge handles the retrieval.\n\nLet’s say you want help finishing a research paper. GPT-5 + superknowledge would take each paragraph in your paper and find all the similar ideas from across the web (papers, blog posts, tweets, videos, etc). Then it would find the counterarguments to each of those ideas. Then the counterarguments to the counterarguments, and so on. It would feel as if a week-long academic conference had analyzed your paper, but in 2 seconds.\n\nOn the other hand, GPT-5 + Google would get stuck because Google can’t handle queries like finding similar ideas or counterarguments.\n\nIt’s difficult for us to fathom how quickly progress will accelerate when every intelligence – whether human or AI – is unblocked by all the knowledge that’s out there.\n\nSuperknowledge prepares us for superintelligence\n\nSuperknowledge doesn’t just accelerate us toward an advanced future, it also accelerates us toward a safer one.\n\nWhen people list the biggest threats to humanity, they don’t usually put the state of our knowledge as the top threat, but it actually is.\n\nThat’s because our knowledge underlies everything in our society – what problems we care about, how we act toward others, which politicians we choose, etc. Every societal malfunction is downstream from bad knowledge.\n\nUnfortunately, our current knowledge ecosystem is a mess. Knowledge is scattered across billions of webpages with no tool powerful enough to organize it all. That makes it extremely hard to become truly well-informed on any issue – you never know what knowledge you’re missing.\n\nWhen people aren’t well-informed, they make the wrong decisions, elect the wrong leaders, and cause inefficiencies throughout society. This is causing real problems, from inane housing laws to actual war.\n\nThe rise of agentic AI systems multiplies this problem dramatically. If AIs are stuck with the same knowledge tools as humans, then we’ll just have thousands more intelligences operating over the same incomplete knowledge. These AIs will interact with billions of people daily and perform actions on their behalf. They will be highly intelligent but misinformed, a dangerous combination.\n\nOur society deserves something better. Building superknowledge is the solution.\n\nSuperknowledge advances safety because it lets people or AIs quickly become well-informed on any topic – from the technologies related to carbon removal to the laws that should govern AI itself. I’d much rather take advice from an AI that analyzed the 10,000 relevant arguments on the web over one that read the first 10 links of a Google search.\n\nWe're now entering the most volatile decade in human history. It’s essential that humans and AIs can rely on a mature knowledge ecosystem that guides us through the chaos.\n\nWe just better build it before superintelligence arrives.\n\nWe're building superknowledge\n\nIt’s no accident that the Bible begins with a story about the tree of knowledge. For 5,000 years, humans have dreamed of knowing everything. We’re going to achieve that dream in about 3 years, and I think it’ll be powered by Exa. This is a historic mission, biblical even.\n\nI’ve personally dreamt of knowing everything for two decades, since I was a little kid lying prone on my 4-foot tall outer-space book wondering what it all means. We're finally almost there.\n\nIt's interesting that no-one else is working on this. While there are dozens of labs working on superintelligence, as far as I'm aware there's only one organization in the world working on superknowledge – Exa.\n\nThat’s partly because building superknowledge requires an organization with the right incentives. Organizations with ad-based revenue models will not build it. Exa, in contrast, has a usage-based revenue model. We’re highly incentivized to give users full control to retrieve whatever knowledge they need. Turns out users would pay a lot for superknowledge.\n\nAnother reason no one's building superknowledge is that it’s hard. We need to design novel ML architectures in a novel research field while building a novel search business. That’s not including all the massive infrastructure required for crawling, storing, processing, and serving petabytes of web data.\n\nYet superknowledge seems more attainable than superintelligence. It requires fewer magical breakthroughs. We have a pretty clear roadmap to get there.\n\nThe clock is ticking. To safely navigate the next decade, we need to build superknowledge before SSI, OpenAI, or some other organization builds superintelligence. For the Exa team, this is the most important technical problem of our time.",

      "# [Generate a Newsletter with Exa Research Agent and CrewAI by Alejandro AO on 2024-06-01](https://alejandro-ao.com/crewai-with-exa-research-agent-newsletter/)\nLinks:\n\nExa\n\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/alejandro-ao/exa-crewai\n\nFollow me on X (Twitter): @alejandro_ao\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the last few months, there has been growing interest in building AI agents that can perform tasks for us. These agents can be used to automate repetitive tasks, like generating text or creating images, and even to perform more complex tasks like research and data analysis.\n\nWhat We Will Build\n\nIn this tutorial, we use Exa and CrewAI to build a team of AI research agents who, given any topic, can perform the following tasks for us:\n\nResearch and summarize the latest news on the given topic.\n\nVerify that the sources are correct and that the articles are relevant to the selected topic.\n\nCompile the top stories into a newsletter using an HTML template.\n\nWhat We Will Learn\n\nIn order to build this, we will use:\n\nCrewAI: a framework to orchestrate a team of AI agents.\n\nExa: the first semantic search API that can retrieve high-quality, relevant web content for our LLM.\n\nWhat Is Exa\n\nVery broadly, Exa is a semantic search engine. This means that you can search for information on the web using natural language rather than keywords. You can think of it as an alternative to Google, but instead of searching by ‘keywords’, it searches by ‘meaning’. You can get 1000 free Exa requests just for signing up!\n\nSemantic Search\n\nThe fact that Exa uses semantic search is especially useful for our project, and will allow us to find the exact news that we are looking for.\n\nAs mentioned before, we will be creating a research agent. This agent should be able to find the latest news on a given topic, which is something that semantic search is better for.\n\nThink about it: if you search for ’latest news on AI’ on Google, you will get a lot of front pages of news websites and blogs that talk about AI. Like this:\n\nBut we don’t want the front pages of blogs that post news about AI. We want the latest news articles themselves. This is what makes Exa so unique: it is able to tell the meaning of the query and return results that correspond to that meaning, not just the keywords.\n\nFor contrast, when looking for ’latest news on AI’ on Exa, you get this:\n\nThis is a much better result for our research agent.\n\nWhat Is CrewAI\n\nCrewAI is an orchestration system that allows you to create a team of AI agents that can perform tasks for you. With very little code, you can design a crew of agents that can reason by themselves, use tools to perform tasks, and communicate with each other to achieve a common goal.\n\nTo install CrewAI, you can use pip:\n\nTo learn more about CrewAI, you can visit my step-by-step guide on how to use it here.\n\nStep 1: Create the Crew\n\nThe first thing to do is to create the crew that will perform the tasks for us. We can build it ourselves using the core components of CrewAI (agents, tools, and tasks) or we can use the CrewAI CLI to create the crew for us. Let’s use the CLI to create the crew:\n\nThis will create a new folder called newsletter-crew. You will find here all the components that you will need to create and orchestrate your agents. In it, you can also find the src/config folder, which contains the configuration files for your crew: agents.yaml and tasks.yaml. These will be automatically loaded to the CrewAI system if you are using the CLI.\n\nConsider that this command initializes a Poetry project, so if you want to add any dependencies, you should do it using Poetry:\n\nStep 2: Create the Tasks\n\nInput and Output\n\nBefore we start building our crew, we need to define the tasks that our agents will need to complete. This is the backbone of your crew. Once you have the tasks that your agents will perform, you can start creating your agents. But in order to define your tasks, you need to know what your input and expected output are. In our case:\n\nInput: the topic of the newsletter\n\nOutput: the HTML code of the newsletter.\n\nOnce you have that, you can start listing the tasks that your agents will need to complete to get from input to expected output. Think of it as a to-do list for your agents.\n\nHow to Define Tasks\n\nThis is usually where things can get tricky. But don’t worry! With some practice, you will be able to create a set of tasks for any automation within a few minutes!\n\nMy advice is to make a list of the to-do items that you would need to complete the task yourself. Then, break down these items into specific and granular tasks that your agents can perform.\n\nHere are some tips for creating your crew:\n\nAvoid tasks that are too complex: If you try to perform too many actions in a single task, it can confuse the agent. For example, asking it to research a topic, summarize it, expand it, and reorder the results might be too much. Instead, break down the task into smaller, simpler tasks.\n\nPerform thorough testing until you get reliable results: You will need to run your crew several times, varying your input to make sure that your agents are working correctly.\n\nHave a monitoring setup: We will not cover monitoring and observability in this tutorial, but consider that you should be able to trace what your agents are thinking and doing. This is crucial for improving your prompts.\n\nFor this tutorial, our tasks will be:\n\nResearch task. To complete this task, the agent will need to:\n\nSearch for the latest news on the given topic.\n\nSelect the most relevant articles.\n\nSummarize the articles.\n\nEdit task. To complete this task, the agent will need to verify that the sources are correct and that the articles are relevant to the selected topic. The agent in charge of this task will also need to improve the summary, add a title, and a comment to the article.\n\nHTML task. To complete this task, the agent will need to replace the selected stories in an HTML template to generate the final newsletter file.\n\nAs I mentioned above, this is a trial and error process. I started off with 4 tasks (I had an extra summary task), but I found that the researcher can do the summary as well without any issues. So I removed the summary task, and now I have 3 tasks. :)\n\nFill the tasks.yaml File\n\nNow that we have our tasks, we can fill the tasks.yaml file with the tasks that our agents will need to complete. Think of it as writing the prompt for your agents. A task in CrewAI contains the following properties:\n\nDescription: A detailed prompt outlining what the task is supposed to do.\n\nExpected Output: The expected output of the task. This is what the agent should return when the task is completed. You can use Few-Shot Learning (include a few examples of the expected output) here.\n\nTools: The tools that the agent can use to complete the task. You can also bind the tools to the agent instead of the task.\n\nAfter some testing and iterations, I came up with the following tasks:\n\nStep 3: Create the agents\n\nNow that we have our tasks, we can start creating the agents that will perform the tasks. An agent in CrewAI is a LangChain Runnable that can use tools to perform tasks. The agent can use the tools to perform the tasks that we defined in the tasks.yaml file.\n\nTo initialize an Agent object, you can specify many parameters. But the most important ones are:\n\nRole: This can be researcher, editor, html_generator, etc.\n\nGoal: This is a brief description of what your agent’s overal goal is. Try to be precise and give your agent a good idea of what its importance is within the entire project.\n\nBackstory: This is a brief description of the agent’s background. This is useful to give your agent a personality and a particular expertise. For example, you can say that the agent is a senior journalist known for its wit and humor. This will influence the writing style of the agent.\n\nHere is an example of an agent that I created for the research task:\n\nStep 4: Create the tools\n\nThe tools are the functions that the agents will use to perform the tasks (that is why it is so important to use an LLM that supports function calling). We will then bind these tools to the agents when initializing them.\n\nIn this example, we will be giving the research tools to the researcher and editor agents. The tools that we will be using will use the following methods from the Exa client:\n\nsearch_and_contents: This tool will search a given query and return the full text contents each article.\n\nfind_similar: This tool will find similar articles to the ones that we pass in.\n\nget_contents: This tool will get the contents of a given URL.\n\nHere is an example of the tools that I created for the researcher agent:\n\nAs you can see, the tools are simple classes that inherit from BaseTool and have a _run method that returns the result of the tool.\n\nIt is very important to properly document the tools with a name and description attribute. This will help the agents understand what the tool does and how to use it.\n\nIt is also a great idea to include an example of the input and output of the tool in the description.\n\nStep 5: Put everything together\n\nOnce that everything is put together, you can put everything together in your crew.py file. This file will initialize the agents and tasks, bind the tools to the agents and create the crew.\n\nHere is an example of a crew.py file:\n\nNote that this is the crew.py file that was generated by the CrewAI CLI. It uses some decorators to make simple tasks easier, such as loading the configuration files and creating the agents and tasks. These decorators deal with some logic behind the scenes that might obscure the code a bit. For example, by using the @agent, @task and @crew decorators, the framwork will automatically create the properties self.agents, self.tasks and pass them to the Crew object.\n\nPass the inputs to your crew\n\nNow you just have to pass the inputs to your crew. This is found in the main.py file that was generated by the CLI. Here is an example of how you can pass the inputs to your crew:\n\nNotice that we are passing the inputs to the crew here. These are the variables that were passed to the prompts in the tasks.yaml and agents.yaml files (those in curly braces {}).\n\nStep 6: Run the crew\n\nOnce everything is set up, you can run the crew using the CrewAI CLI. Remember that we are using poetry to manage the dependencies, so you should make sure that all your dependencies are installed in the virtual environment that you are using.\n\nTo run the crew, you can use the following command:\n\nIf you are unsure about the name of your crew, you can check the readme.md file that was generated by the CLI. It will contain detailed instructions on how to run your crew.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this tutorial, we created a team of AI agents that can generate a newsletter for us. We used CrewAI to orchestrate the agents and tasks, and we used the Exa API to search for the latest news on a given topic. We also learned how to define the tasks that our agents will need to complete, how to create the agents that will perform the tasks, and how to bind the tools to the agents. Finally, we learned how to put everything together and run the crew.",

Consider the graphics processing unit (GPU), invented over 25 years ago, or Internet Protocol, developed over decades, and expected to continue advancing for many more. Both absorbed many other technologies, simplifying and unifying disparate technologies and practices.\n\nPure Storage leverages its core Purity technology in the same way for artificial intelligence (AI) with today’s introduction of FlashBlade//EXA™.

      "# [FlashBlade//EXA Has Arrived – The Data Storage Platform to Transform Large-scale AI and HPC by Alex Castro on 2025-03-11](https://blog.purestorage.com/products/flashblade-exa-for-large-ai-workloads/)\nRacers, start your engines! Pure Storage is excited to announce FlashBlade//EXA™—an ultra-scale data storage platform optimized for AI workloads by providing massive storage throughput and operating at extreme levels of performance and scale.\n\nWhat do high-performance car manufacturers and Pure Storage have in common? Just as top-tier automakers design cutting-edge race car models that push the limits of speed and efficiency, FlashBlade//EXA is built to deliver next-level performance for AI and HPC workloads. FlashBlade//EXA is similar to those examples in that it is a FlashBlade® system with Purity//FB highly optimized to provide next-level performance for the most demanding AI workloads. It complements the high-performance FlashBlade//S™ and high-density FlashBlade//E™ models that have been proven in the enterprise market and recognized in the Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for File and Object Storage Platforms as a leader for four years in a row.\n\nThe Business Challenge of Rapid AI Advancements\n\nAs AI innovation expands, many businesses are quickly discovering value in augmenting or revolutionizing their existing operations with model training and inference. This accelerated growth has increased the adoption of AI workflows across pre-processing, training, testing, fine-tuning, and deployment—each benefiting from more powerful GPUs and larger, multimodal data sets.\n\nThis expansion has also introduced new infrastructure challenges. Legacy storage scalability, checkpointing, management, and metadata performance limitations at scale are creating bottlenecks and hindering the full utilization of expensive GPU-oriented infrastructures and slowing progress and innovation. This greatly impacts AI’s aggressive ROI financial pressures—any infrastructure dedicated to it has to run at peak performance to ensure the fastest time to value possible for model training and inference. Lost time is lost money.\n\nBusiness Challenges Are Amplified with Large-scale AI Workflows\n\nThis business challenge of idle GPUs equating to lost time and money is exponentially amplified at scale, e.g., GPU cloud providers and AI labs, for two reasons. First, massive operational efficiency at scale is core to their profitability and ranges well beyond what most on-prem/in-house data center operations manage. A blog we published last year offered insight into how service providers think and how automation and brutal standardization are critical to their operations. Second, service providers subscribe to the core tenet of avoiding any resources running idle. For them, idle GPUs in any AI model are a lost revenue opportunity—storage inefficiencies at their level of operations can be damaging.\n\nTraditional high-performance storage architectures have been built on parallel file systems and were designed and optimized for traditional, dedicated high-performance computing (HPC) environments. HPC workloads are predictable, so the parallel storage systems could be optimized for specific performance scaling. Large-scale AI-based workflows and models are different from traditional HPC because they are more complex, involving many more parameters that are also multimodal by including text files, images, videos, and more—all of which need to be processed simultaneously by tens of thousands of GPUs. These new dynamics are quickly proving how traditional HPC-based storage approaches struggle to perform at a larger scale. More specifically, the performance of traditional parallel storage systems becomes contentious with servicing metadata and associated data from the same storage controller plane.\n\nThis emerging bottleneck requires new thinking for metadata management and data access optimizations to efficiently manage diverse data types and high concurrency of AI workloads at a service provider scale.\n\nExtreme Storage Scaling Requirements with AI Workload Evolution\n\nAs data volumes surge, metadata management becomes a critical bottleneck. Legacy storage struggles to scale metadata efficiently, leading to latency and performance degradation—especially for AI and HPC workloads that demand extreme parallelism. Traditional architectures, built for sequential access, can’t keep up. They often suffer from rigidity and complexity, limiting scalability. Overcoming these challenges requires a metadata-first architecture that scales seamlessly, supports massive parallelism, and eliminates bottlenecks. As the AI and HPC opportunity evolves, the challenges are only compounded.\n\nThe proven metadata core available in FlashBlade//S has helped enterprise customers address demanding AI training, tuning, and inference requirements by overcoming metadata challenges, such as:\n\nConcurrency management: Handling massive volumes of metadata requests across multiple nodes efficiently\n\nHotspot prevention: Avoiding single metadata server bottlenecks that can degrade performance and require ongoing tuning and optimizations\n\nConsistency at scale: Ensuring synchronization across distributed metadata copies\n\nEfficient hierarchy management: Optimizing complex file system operations while maintaining performance\n\nScalability and resiliency: Sustaining high performance as data volumes grow exponentially\n\nOperational efficiency: Ensuring that management and overhead is minimized and automated to support efficiency at scale\n\nFlashBlade//EXA Addresses AI Performance Challenges at Scale\n\nPure Storage has a proven track record of supporting customers across a broad range of high performance use cases and at every stage of their AI journey. Since introducing AIRI® (AI-ready infrastructure) in 2018, we’ve continued to lead with innovations like certifications for NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD™ and NVIDIA DGX BasePOD™ as well as turnkey solutions like GenAI Pods. FlashBlade has earned trust in the enterprise AI and HPC market, helping organizations like Meta scale its AI workloads efficiently. Our metadata core is built on a massively distributed transactional database, and key-value store technology has ensured high metadata availability and efficient scaling. By applying insights from hyperscalers and leveraging our advanced metadata core proven with FlashBlade//S, Pure Storage has the unique ability to deliver extreme performance storage that overcomes the metadata challenges of large-scale AI and HPC.\n\nEnter FlashBlade//EXA.\n\nAs extreme end-to-end AI workflows push the boundaries of infrastructure, the need for a data storage platform that matches this scale has never been greater. FlashBlade//EXA extends the FlashBlade family, ensuring large-scale AI and HPC environments are no longer constrained by legacy storage limitations.\n\nFlashBlade//EXA is designed for AI factories and delivers a massively parallel processing architecture that disaggregates data and metadata, eliminating bottlenecks and complexity associated with legacy parallel file systems. Built on the proven strengths of FlashBlade and powered by Purity//FB’s advanced metadata architecture, it provides unmatched throughput, scalability, and simplicity at any scale.\n\nWhether supporting AI natives, tech titans, AI-driven enterprises, GPU-powered cloud providers, HPC labs, or research centers, FlashBlade//EXA meets the demands of the most data-intensive environments. Its next-generation design enables seamless production, inference, and training—offering a comprehensive data storage platform for even the most demanding AI workloads.\n\nOur innovative approach in how we modified Purity//FB, which involved splitting the high-speed throughput network-based I/O into two discrete elements:\n\nThe FlashBlade array stores and manages the metadata with its industry-leading scale-out distributed key/value database.\n\nA cluster of third-party data nodes is where the blocks of data are stored and accessed at very high speed from the GPU cluster over Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) using industry-standard networking protocols.\n\nThis segregation provides non-blocking data access that increases exponentially in high-performance computing scenarios where the metadata requests can equal, if not outnumber, data I/O operations.\n\nWhy Off-The-Shelf Servers and SSDs for Data Nodes?\n\nLarge-scale AI environments can have an established investment of 1U and 2U servers with SSDs as infrastructure building blocks. FlashBlade//EXA leverages off-the-shelf servers for the data plane—making it easier to fit into the target customer’s architecture (in this case, large-scale environments). This highlights an important point about our data storage platform:\n\n*Purity’s strength, as the heart of our platform, lies in its ability to be modified to address new use cases, even if it means stretching to operate outside our own hardware. Solving challenges with our software is a core principle for us because it’s a more elegant approach and provides a faster time to value for customers.\n\nThese off-the-shelf data nodes give customers the flexibility to adapt over time and can be driven by the customers’ evolution on how they leverage NAND flash in their data centers.\n\nA High-level View of FlashBlade//EXA Components and I/O\n\nWhile separating the metadata and data servicing planes out, we’ve focused on keeping the elements in the above diagram simple to scale and manage:\n\nMetadata Core: This services all metadata queries from the compute cluster. When a query is serviced, the requesting compute node will be directed to the specific data node to do its work. The array also oversees the relationship of data nodes to metadata via a control plane connection that is behind the scenes on its own network segment.\n\nThird-party data nodes: These are standard off-the-shelf servers to ensure broad compatibility and flexibility. The data blocks reside on the NVMe drives in these servers. They will run a “thin” Linux-based OS and kernel with volume management and RDMA target services that are customized to work with metadata residing on the FlashBlade//EXA array. We will include an Ansible playbook to manage deployment and upgrades to the nodes to eliminate any concerns about complexity at scale.\n\nParallel access to data using the existing networking environment: FlashBlade//EXA employs an elegant approach that leverages a highly available, single-core network utilizing BGP to route and manage traffic among metadata, data, and workload clients. This design enables seamless integration into existing customer networks, simplifying the deployment of highly parallel storage environments. Importantly, all leveraged network protocols are industry standard; the communication stack contains no proprietary elements.\n\nUnpacking the Challenges of Legacy High-performance Storage with Parallel File Systems and Disaggregated Models\n\nMany storage vendors targeting the high-performance nature of large AI workloads only solve for half of the parallelism problem—offering the widest networking bandwidth possible for clients to get to data targets. They don’t address how metadata and data are serviced at massive throughput, which is where the bottlenecks at large scale emerge. This makes sense since the intent of NFS’s design when Sun Microsystems created it back in 1984 was to simply bridge the gap between local and remote file access, where the design focus was functionality over speed.\n\nChallenges of Scaling with Legacy NAS\n\nThe design and scale of legacy NAS prohibits supporting parallel storage because of its single-purpose design to service operational file shares and inability to scale I/O linearly as more controllers are added.\n\nChallenges of Scaling with Traditional Parallel File Systems\n\nEven before the current rise of AI, some legacy storage providers leveraged specialized parallel file systems like Lustre to deliver high-throughput parallelism for high-performance computing needs. While this worked for several large and small environments, it is prone to metadata latency, extremely complicated networking, and management complexity, often relegated to PhDs who oversaw their HPC architectures and associated soft costs when scaling to larger needs.\n\nChallenges of Disaggregated Data and Compute Solutions\n\nOther storage vendors have architected their solutions to not only rely on a purpose-built parallel file system but also add a compute aggregation layer between workload clients and the metadata and data targets:\n\nThis model suffers from expansion rigidity and more management complexity challenges than pNFS when scaling for massive performance because it involves adding more moving parts with compute aggregation nodes. There is another potential challenge—the deployment of disaggregated data access functions in this model risks unexpected latency in the stack because its networking becomes much more complicated in managing the addressing, cabling, and connectivity with three discrete layers versus what is needed for pNFS.\n\nAdditionally, each data and metadata node is assigned a fixed amount of cache where metadata is always stored. This rigidity forces data and metadata to scale in lockstep, creating inefficiencies for multimodal and dynamic workloads. And, as workload demands shift, this linear scaling approach can lead to performance bottlenecks and unnecessary infrastructure overprovisioning, further complicating resource management and limiting flexibility.\n\nWe’re Just Getting Started, Too\n\nOur FlashBlade//EXA announcement revolutionizes performance, scalability, and simplicity for large-scale AI workloads. And we’re just getting started.\n\nContact your Pure Storage team to learn more about how we are, once again, disrupting conventional thinking in one of the fast-growing segments of the industry!\n\nMeet with us at NVIDIA GTC 2025, March 17-21.
