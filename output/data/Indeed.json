  "summary_markdown": "# About Indeed\n\nIndeed is a leading employment-related metasearch engine for job listings, founded on November 1, 2004, by Paul Forster and Rony Kahan [(Crunchbase, 2024)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/indeed). The company is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and Austin, Texas, with additional offices in Austin, Dublin, London, San Mateo, New York, and Stamford. Indeed operates in more than 50 countries and 28 languages, covering 94% of global GDP. It is recognized as the #1 source of external hires for employers, with over 140 million monthly unique visitors, which is double the traffic of the next leading job site [(Crunchbase, 2024)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/indeed).\n\nIndeed provides a platform for job seekers to access millions of job listings from thousands of company websites and job boards for free. The company generates revenue through a pay-for-performance recruitment advertising network, driving millions of targeted applicants to jobs across various fields. This model is considered the most cost-effective source of candidates for thousands of companies [(Crunchbase, 2024)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/indeed).\n\nThe company serves a wide range of employers, from small businesses to large corporations, looking to fill job vacancies efficiently. Indeed's services for employers include access to insightful data, tools for crafting job descriptions, and a dashboard for managing job postings and recruitment processes [(Indeed for Employers UK dashboard, 2024)](https://uk.indeed.com/employers/login).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nChris Hyams is the CEO of Indeed. He has been vocal about the company's challenges and the rationale behind recent layoffs, emphasizing the need to simplify operations and reignite growth [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/). Hyams's leadership is crucial as Indeed navigates its current restructuring phase.\n\n# News\n\n## Layoffs and Restructuring\n\nIndeed has been undergoing significant restructuring, including layoffs. In May 2024, the company announced the layoff of approximately 1,000 employees, representing about 8% of its workforce [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/). This followed a previous layoff of around 2,200 employees in March 2023, which accounted for 15% of the workforce, due to a downturn in job postings [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/). The layoffs are primarily concentrated in the U.S., particularly within the Research & Development (R&D) and Go-to-Market teams. CEO Chris Hyams stated that these actions are part of a strategy to simplify the organization and improve decision-making processes [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/).\n\n## Commitment to Connecticut\n\nDespite the layoffs, Indeed has reaffirmed its commitment to Connecticut, maintaining its co-headquarters there. The company has stated that there will be no changes to its real estate footprint in the state, with Stamford remaining a key sales office integral to its long-term plans [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/).\n\n## Product Challenges and Innovations\n\nIndeed has faced challenges with some of its product offerings, particularly with the rollout of a new payment scheme called \"pay per application.\" This model, intended to allow employers to pay only for accepted applications, encountered difficulties, especially for small businesses struggling with the approval process [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/).\n\n## Recent Partnerships and Initiatives\n\nIndeed has been involved in various initiatives and partnerships to enhance its offerings. In June 2020, the company partnered with the state of Connecticut to create a custom jobs portal to assist job seekers and employers during the pandemic [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/). Additionally, Indeed has been leveraging AI to improve the recruiting process and has partnered with Business Insider on \"The Better Work Project\" to help workforce leaders and HR managers [(Business Insider Press Room, 2024-10-22)](https://www.businessinsider.com/business-insider-and-indeed-partner-on-the-better-work-project-2024-10).\n\n## Legal and Market Developments\n\nIndeed has been involved in legal disputes, such as a lawsuit against ZipRecruiter for spreading false information about its website [(Adolfo Pesquera, 2024-10-08)](https://www.law.com/texaslawyer/2024/10/08/ziprecruiter-is-trying-to-sabotage-indeeds-website-new-lawsuit-claims/). The company is also adapting to market trends, with reports of increased demand for truck driver jobs and a focus on AI and skills-first hiring [(RTE.ie, 2024-07-25)](https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2024/0725/1461729-indeed-survey-on-demand-for-jobs/), [(Business Insider, 2024-11-01)](https://www.businessinsider.com/sc/how-ai-is-rewriting-the-rules-of-recruitment).\n\nIn conclusion, Indeed is at a pivotal moment, facing significant restructuring and layoffs while striving to simplify its operations and reignite growth. The company's commitment to its Connecticut headquarters and its ongoing efforts to innovate its job search platform will be crucial as it adapts to the evolving job market landscape.",

Some random 3rd party job board was indexing my career site and reposting the jobs, including re-syndicating them back out to Indeed (but linking to their site, not mine).\n\nThis is/was a somewhat common traffic scam for new job boards, and Indeed usually does a good job of catching them - but this one time, their system thought the other job board was the real poster, and my career site was trying to re-post the same jobs. \n\nTook ages to figure out what was happening, and only because we were able to find and identify the source of the fraudulent postings.\n\n## Comment ID jmzkuq0 with +2 score by [(MBroxas, Reddit, 2023-06-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/140z33l/my_jobs_keep_getting_flagged_on_indeedcom_and/jmzkuq0/) (in reply to ID 140z33l):\nIt’s a little hard to narrow down without looking at the posts, but you can try looking for words that aren’t inclusive of all applicants. This is usually gender but it can be other things too. Like if your post says “he” will need to perform blank task, it’ll likely be taken down. Same goes for things like religion, and military service etc. Pretty much anything that would go into an EEO statement.

Last spring we suddenly got flagged for suspicious activity. I do worry spam is somehow attached to us because I am dealing with some pretty bad hacking issues still. Shortly after they then suspended our account.  I called at least 50 times over a month, speaking to different agents and then upper management. All gave me a possible reason of what might have caused flagging, however they avoid telling me the exact reason, which I thought is very strange. I gave them my business license and other documents proving we are not fake or a scam. They thanked me for being so transparent but still could not release suspension! \n\nI made new appointment and management contacted me about account. I was advised to try changing my pay structure within my ads. Make more realistic and not to oversell and to keep basic info. This is what our agents make though? some actually make more than what I had in our ad... I was then advised to try to add some sort of base pay. I let her know, our managers make salary plus commission however our agent have a very nice performance based structure. It motivates and is successful. She then advised me that upper corp doesn't like to bring on so many \"commission only\" companies. I was kind of shocked! we have always marketed on their platform and never got flagged now every ad is flagged before being posted and now they are telling me to change how I pay people?\n\nThis issue began last spring and I am STILL dealing with is a year later now! It has crippled my company.

I'm having something of a nightmare with indeed.\n\nI tried posting a job, and I immediately got a message saying \"account paused for suspicious activity\".  I know the scammers have taken over like half the internet, so I understand.  I replied to this message attaching my driver's license and Doing Business As certification that I got from the city where I live.  I got a reply back saying \"We do not accept these documents.  Please send us your business license.\"\n\nGod... the business i want to start is a very simple house cleaning thing.  That's all.  But okay, I look up the procedure for getting a business license.  It requires that I go to my city's planning department, pick up some documents, have the landlord of the house where I live fill them out, then bring them back to the planning department, get them certified, then go to town hall and file them in for an official business license.  This whole thing ends up costing a week of ping-ponging around government offices and I've spent nearly 200 dollars to get everything involved (I'm leaving a bunch of stuff out.)\n\nBut finally, I have it!  MY BUSINESS LICENSE!  YAY!  I take a picture and email it straight away to indeed.\n\nI get a reply back -- I kid you not -- \"we cannot accept this as it does not link to your home address\".\n\nMy home address is quite literally in 2 places, in big, bold font, right there on the license.  I'm not sure how a picture of my business license can \"link\" in any other fashion.  When I reply to them saying \"yes it is, it's right there\", they write back saying \"looks like we can't help you, go to our help page, thanks\".  \n\nI wrote back a long and sincere, genuine plea, that I can absolutely prove beyond any doubt that I'm a real person, and offered dozens of options, including making a youtube video of me walking into my own house, showing the address, and showing the desk where I'd be dispatching cleaners to various houses.  I could provide references of other people who could swear under penalty of perjury that I'm really doing what I claim to do.  \n\nThey wrote back the same reply as before, saying \"looks like we can't help you, go to our help page, thanks\".\n\nFrom there, I decided to contact their holdings company which is located in Japan and write them about what's going on.  They replied saying they can't help me, I'd have to contact someone more local.  I then looked up the indeed office in the US, found the emails of the top execs at the Indeed building in Texas, and included them in the email exchange (this was yesterday and today is July 4, a holiday, so no reply yet.)  No contact phone number was never given to me during any of this so I couldn't call anyone.\n\nWhile this was going on, I figured I'd also try signing in with a completely different email, and ask my girlfriend if I could use her credit card to try posting the job again, thus potentially getting around this block.  Different email, different card number, different name, went through the entire process, and..... believe it or not, got the same exact insta-block \"ACCOUNT IS SUSPICIOUS\" stuff from before.  \n\nI think it's time to just give up on indeed.  After all the above happened, by pure chance I found a phone number where I can call them, but like I said it's July 4th.  I'll try calling them tomorrow or next week, but if this doesn't work, then I'll just move on to monster or zip-recruiter and not use indeed anymore.  \n\nOne last thought...\n\nI've noticed when I try searching for a job on indeed, every job is super low quality, or +30 days old (meaning it's basically dead.)  I no longer see the plethora of relevant jobs from a variety of businesses I would have seen just a year ago.  I guess this means everyone else is running into this same brick wall?\n\nThanks for posting the thread.  It's good to know I'm not the only one.\n\n## Comment ID lc27nbl with +1 score by [(MushroomRelative6726, Reddit, 2024-07-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/140z33l/my_jobs_keep_getting_flagged_on_indeedcom_and/lc27nbl/) (in reply to ID 140z33l):\nHere is what I do.

      "# Post ID r4e6rh: The ugly truth of Indeed. An HR viewpoint with +4211 score by [(blaq_sheep90, Reddit, 2021-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/)\nI've spent years on both sides of using Indeed. Here is everything you need to know. May apply to other job sites.\n\nIndeed is just a glorified parasite of a website and most of the jobs you find on there are false doors. Indeed works by scraping hundreds or thousands of other websites for real job postings, and recreates the information as a new job in its own format. An overwhelming majority of jobs posted here are clones. Applying to these cloned jobs does absolutely nothing. Nobody receives your information. They are a fake-it-until-they-made-it success story of sharing near false information to draw the crowd and then charge companies for legitimate direct postings and charge recruiters for access to applicant resumes and information.\n\nYes, you can still find some legitimate postings on here for success. Consider closer looks at sponsored positions. Companies pay for these specific listings to show at the top of your search, so there is more likely someone on the other end going through those applications. \n\nFor non-sponsored jobs, read through the description to see if it gives explicit instructions about applying through Indeed. The quick apply button doesn't count. \n\nDon't apply to anything more than two weeks old. If the posting is being monitored, it may be nearly filled, overrun with applications, or focus has moved from checking this posting to another (we are human after all). Old and filled postings are nearly impossible to take down, so most are just left to time out through the site. This takes around six weeks.\n\nUse indeed as a resource to find job postings, but then go directly to a company's website to search for the job and apply directly with them. You'll get much more information about the company and the role (if it is still vacant), and increase your odds that an actual person sees your resume. \n\nSpeaking of resumes, do NOT use Indeed's resumes to apply to anything. Ever. They are terrible. Sure, they are better than nothing, but they likely share more information than you want to, are not tailored for anything, and show you lack any computer skills or creativity. \n\nIndeed and similar sites can be beneficial, but as with most things on the internet, be skeptical.\n\nHopefully this gets you out of recruiting hell.\n\n## Comment ID hmg9jtw with +607 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmg9jtw/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThank you for your post.

If so, the company would have gotten what it wants already unless whatever they're hiring for is *seriously* specific. \n* Is this the second or third time you've seen the same job posting?

Recruiters can be beneficial. Reach out to specific individual recruiters that have an industry specialty. Avoid the recruiting companies unless you're desperate.

I removed myself from Indeed after all Indeed-related emails I got from recruiters were completely spammy or worse, low-balled on rates so it seemed clear they were only seeking to justify Americans turning job applications down so they could bring in foreign labor.\n\nIn one case, the recruiter used a four year old Microsoft job req now long gone but matched it to my old Indeed resume on the basis of keywords.\n\nI find that recruiters often do not actually have my resume, they have the ATS scrapers like Ceipal  that send them candidate addresses. I learned this seeing multiple times when recruiter referenced Indeed resume from which I long ago removed certain keyword terms, but had never read my resume.\n\nAlso, I long ago removed my phone number from resumes posted online and yet I continually get calls (at least 10-20 a week) from New Jersey agencies using offshore recruiters. Clearly the databases used have been scraped years ago, and likely that sites like Indeed still keep obsolete resumes from deleted accounts.

A lot of their skills and keywords got entered into the talent database profile so it’s highly likely that random recruiters you talked to years ago still have only the old resume on file unless they received a new one to update it. Fancier companies might auto update resumes in their CRM from indeed and LinkedIn but I believe ours was manual each time we worked with a candidate we would update the res on file.

However, I encounter very many bad recruiters with questionable data sources and are tiny (one-man I am guessing) new companies, not any of the old-line tech recruiting agencies. Some I suspect previously worked at a bigger agency, scraped their database there, then jumped ship to start their own shop.\n\nFor reasons I still don't understand causality for, a whole lot of such agencies are in New Jersey, and many use ATS services like Ceipal. My guess is the advent of these automated suppliers has opened up an era of zero-effort to get into recruiting, and makes use maybe of Ceipal-like services that possibly steal databases. So now maybe anyone with coin can open up an agency with no research required for candidates, and they run a numbers game spamming. Now, in my daily flood of email from recruiters, if the agency is obviously miniscule and new and the recruiter is Indian, I discard it as  spam because experience over the last year.\n\n## Comment ID hmht8l1 with +6 score by [(itsrattlesnake, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmht8l1/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\n> Don't apply to anything more than two weeks old.\n\nOvertime I learned this.

Ever. They are terrible. Sure, they are better than nothing, but they likely share more information than you want to, are not tailored for anything, and show you lack any computer skills or creativity.\n\nDepends, I've recruited for 6 years and I've worked for old school employers who care about something tailored. I've also worked for employers that just need the information and don't care - especially if its a high demand field. It just depends on where you're looking to work. Generally its better to have an actual resume that isn't cookie cutter, but I don't believe it truly hurts your chances unless your indeed resume looks like its garbage with a bunch of spelling errors. \n\nIndeed all around is the worst. Its clunky, servers get overwhelmed too quickly, and the price to have a posting show in the first few pages is getting more and more expensive. Its astronomical now. It'd be better if everyone moved to a different platform so employers could take the money they're using on indeed ads and reachouts and just pay employees more so they'll stay.\n\n## Comment ID hmh0tel with +3 score by [(cybernewtype2, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmh0tel/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThis has been my experience as well.

They changed all the formatting to this really basic ugly style but said it would be accepted by automated systems much easier. And I genuinely got a significantly higher response rate after using the new ugly resume. \n\nFrom a hiring manager perspective, sometimes Indeed sends you hundreds or thousands of candidates and it can be completely overwhelming if your job is not a full time recruiter and you’re not looking to use recruiters. \n\nIf you don’t have automated systems in place to scan the resumes, then a lot of it is manual. I’m almost embarrassed about how long this took me, but I tried to be very thorough. I recently went through about 45 developer resumes for an open position and that took me a solid 4 hours. I had to manually download each resume and ctrl-f all the skills I was looking for then dig deeper into the ones that had the tech skills to get into their work history.\n\nIf a small company receives a buttload of candidates it may be just one person reviewing them who has other job duties to take care of. Job posts that are a few weeks old aren’t always the dealbreaker people think they are and aren’t necessarily a sign that the whole interview process will be slow or that no one wants the job. Once we’ve done the first interview we schedule all remaining ones for that person and have a decision in a matter of days.\n\n## Comment ID hmhrhz5 with +3 score by [(Bengerm77, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmhrhz5/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nI've wasted so much time on there.

It's incredibly similar to Google, but only in the jobs vertical. Employers can also post jobs without having a separate web presence. A lot of ATS systems upload jobs directly.

I like to enter in things I've done recently first and then go back from there.\n\nFor example, you might have recently worked at a tire shop or something so you could say something like \"repaired/replaced car tires\"\n\"Checked/changed car oil and filter\"\n\"Drove various makes and model of customer vehicles through tight spaces\"\n\"Inventoried and transported several pounds of heavy cargo by dolly\"\n\nBasically tasks you are familiar with within your previous jobs and can say you've done enough times to not mess it up.  You can also add in independent work like mowing lawns, house repairs, ect.  Try to avoid adding complicated/niche work that you've only done a passable job of once or twice unless you are really confident you could do it again in a professional setting.\n\nNext, you add the job you did that task next to it (one square over in my case) at or \"freelance\" if it was something you did outside of a formal job.\n\nNext, add rough time frames that you did those things.  I try to get at least the years right and then if I can remember the months and days, I'll add those too.  The numbers here can be annotated with question marks or left blank if I'm not sure and need to check later.  This isn't what's going to the employer anyway, it's organizing for a tailored resume to be made later.\n\nDo these until you need a break and save it to a readily accessible computer or phone.  Come back and add more whenever you can think of it.  The most I've seen someone need to go back is 10 years or so.\n\nNow, when you apply for a job, get ahold of the job description, pull up this list you made, and grab whichever tasks you can match the words up with, some rewording may be needed.  Contact details at the top, relevant jobs with the relevant tasks next, relevant certifications and schooling after, preferred contact point and short, cordial note at the bottom expressing your looking forward to the interview.  (That last bit is my experience of confidence getting you places you have no sound reason to be)\n\nIf you had \"irrelevant\" jobs in the gaps between your chosen relevant jobs and tasks, you can just add the place of employment and an accurate job title but otherwise leave it at that.  Try to keep your employment history from having gaps but don't volunteer more than you need.  It's just clutter for most people and can get you blindsided if someone takes an interest in otherwise unrelated information.\n\n### Comment ID kuazmsr with +1 score by [(v0lume4, Reddit, 2024-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/kuazmsr/) (in reply to ID hmguq9f):\nGreat answer.\n\n## Comment ID hmhgbp6 with +5 score by [(LindzwithaphOG, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmhgbp6/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nAlso, if you applied to your current job through Indeed, your current HR department can tell if you are applying to other jobs.\n\n## Comment ID hmhdn6l with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmhdn6l/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nI found my 2nd job on this website but my 2nd job was shit.

LinkedIn is usually second.\n\nIf there's a link to the company's website, apply. Usually Quick Apply is an integration with an ATS, I think, so apply. If those things aren't there, find the company's website and see if the job is posted and if it's a legit company.\n\nThe main advantage of applying through the company's website is you get to answer everything that they want so your profile isn't missing anything they deemed important. Granted, that can totally suck too, can we say 30 minute assessment test, yuck.\n\nThe age of a job posting comes into play only when it's for high volume positions (typically the entry level type jobs or the ones that are saturated - you should know if it is or not). Don't NOT apply because some random person on the internet said you are wasting your time. Again, it all depends on the type of job. \n\nYou should know if you're in the high volume, niche, hard to find, etc category. Once you understand the market for your job and your skills, then you'll understand the game better and know when to apply and when not to.\n\nI applied 2.5 weeks in and beat out about 100 applicants because I knew I had everything they were looking for and everything they know they wanted but didn't list because that would narrow down the pool too much. If I wasn't a perfect fit, I probably wouldn't have applied.\n\n## Comment ID hms0ogx with +2 score by [(loki444, Reddit, 2021-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hms0ogx/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThis is great information.

Informative, but not busy or bulky. Your job titles, company, and dates should stand out at the first glance. Recruiters spend 5-10 seconds looking at a resume and should be able to see those first.\n\nPersonalization is good, but designs or colors shouldn't distract from the actual written content. \n\nWrite the details of your employment history as a mix of job description and highlighting accomplishments. \n\nThere are tons of resources on Google images or YouTube to get ideas of putting yours together.

Why do you need their resume to have creativity to perform the job description you listed?

What does typing in a Google doc vs using an indeed resume say about computer skills at the end of the day? \n\nIf the job requires computer skills I'm sure the resume will list their qualifications regardless.

I've experienced situations where I've done so much different titles thinking I'm being promoted but because I'm skilled enough to get the job done they us me to relieve other works.

PLEASE do go directly to the employer and apply there. It also gives you a chance to see if the position is still posted and if it is a real posting.  Most jobs are filled in 30-days. If it is still open, there are tons of applicants already overwhelming the employer. A recruiter only needs a few good applicants to submitted to the hiring manager. The rest of the resumes/applications are never seen. \n\nI second the motion, if you have Indeed to create a resume for you, it is not at all professional, and they all look the same (elementary). Also, keep in mind Indeed is also running a recruitment business themselves; your information is now in their hands to have access to you and your details. You are now in their ATS (applicant tracking system). A lot has changed with the Indeed posting site. It is not what is used to be. There was a time when only well-known employers posted. There are a lot of businesses you have never heard of on there now. Unknown business postings/small operations are big money for Indeed, many are considered staffing agencies in their eyes.  They are categorized much differently.\n\n## Comment ID jktcekk with +2 score by [(Separate-Reaction334, Reddit, 2023-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/jktcekk/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\n# I just took one of their assessments and the score was sent to the employer, but it was not shared with me \n\nI am so SICK of Indeed\n\n## Comment ID jsspsa0 with +2 score by [(Acceptable-Eye-2473, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/jsspsa0/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nIndeed must have never even read my Resume'.

In my last interactions with our account representative, I inquired about any projected price increases so I could submit my department's annual budget to the finance team. He said none were planned, and we transitioned into the predicted \"spend more money for better results\" convo that he constantly drones on about citing Indeed's biased data that, of course, connects recruitment success to increased consumer spending whenever he has my ear. I told him that the $5 a day per posting works well for us, and we continuously maintain the lowest vacancy rate in our industry. I submit our budget to our finance team; then the next day, Indeed forces us to spend at least $9 a day per posting. To my knowledge, before this convo, there was no cost minimum. There have been other instances where we discuss a feature, and then the next thing I know, it only becomes available if you spend an exuberant amount of money a day. With this forced increase in recruitment cost, there has been no change in our recruitment results, contrary to their \"studies.\" \n\nI am 150% positive the representatives are rewarded for their ability to force us to spend more. It is in any professional's interest who conducts business with them not to give their representative any information on how they use Indeed for recruiting. They will turn off the features discussed and force you to pay more to continue using them. \n\nThe representative is dense and does not understand we are a government-funded nonprofit that provides supports to disabled adults. CA's current governor has been throwing our industry under the bus year after year regarding funding disabled services when approving the annual budget. We don't have the means to spend the recommended minimum of $67 per day for each listing. I repeat this like a broken record, over and over and over and over and over... to the point I *HATE* talking to him. Repeating myself is my biggest peeve. If you are reading this, Tyrone C., I think you're a tool.\n\nI'm exploring recruitment alternatives to cut Indeed out of HR operations.\n\n### Comment ID kxq3wqi with +1 score by [(blaq_sheep90, Reddit, 2024-04-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/kxq3wqi/) (in reply to ID kxpy3r0):\nI left recruiting shortly after I wrote this, but I still stand by what I said. Indeed is a good source of information, but not the total package it says it is. \n\nPost-pandemic recruiting research is limited, and will be for a few more years, but there are more trends leaning towards smaller scale recruiting efforts like targeting advertising toward professional groups (like shrm to fill an hr vacancy) and referral bonuses are becoming more common, too. \n\nAs a nonprofit, you may be better off saving your dollars and trying other free sources like college career centers, govt services, religious orgs, ect. Paying local and national organizations that specialize in the profession or industry you're hiring for or offering referral bonuses to your employees might see better ROI.\n\n## Comment ID kzli3so with +1 score by [(Maximum-Estimate-112, Reddit, 2024-04-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/kzli3so/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nDoes anyone else experience this?\n\n\nJobs you are lookingfor \n\n\nCity state etc \n\n\nIt gives you maybe one then it gives you pages of nothing you are looking for.\n\n## Comment ID l2hm1tw with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-05-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/l2hm1tw/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThanks for the insight.

Director of TA here. We use Indeed heavily at my current company and have done so at previous Fortune 500 companies. \n\nI don’t love Indeed, but it’s not a scam. Companies post and sponsor jobs on Indeed because of the sheer volume of candidates. Indeed has more traffic (people) than the next 7 largest job boards combined. We spend a lot of money and time managing our Indeed postings. \n\nRoughly half of our hires come from Indeed. This is a mix of positions from professional to manufacturing to retail to sales. For professional positions we post and source from LinkedIn as well. \n\nIt’s also for a company to be integrated with Indeed so if you apply on Indeed, your application actually goes I to the company’s applicant tracking system. If they have one. If not, the company (recruiters) will work the applications from the Indeed dashboard.\n\n## Comment ID kqw4puw with +1 score by [(AffectionatePilot242, Reddit, 2024-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/kqw4puw/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nWell that explains why I've applied to 10-20 different jobs and got no responses whatsoever.

      "# Post ID 8s34e4: Special relationship between Indeed.com and Unemployment Office? with +2 score by [(watdonowplz, Reddit, 2018-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/8s34e4/special_relationship_between_indeedcom_and/)\nMy manager has told me on several occasions that the unemployment office has partnered with Indeed.com to track the job search/interviewing habits of unemployment beneficiaries.  This seems odd to me and I am highly skeptical. I have done some research but have found nothing to support his statement.  \n\nI am sure beneficiaries can submit proof of job search activity via what their Indeed applications yield (e.g. automated \"Thank you for applying\" or \"You application has successfully been submitted\" etc...).  However, my manager is adamant that Indeed has a special relationship with the Unemployment Office to keep track of application activities.  This all stems from the fact that I use Indeed to recruit heavily. I find it's quick, cheap, and effective.  A lot of candidates are not ideal but when you're recruiting for a $12-$13 per hour contact center position we're really just looking for a pleasant personality and a stable job history. We have a very high interview no-show rate, and my manager chalks this up to Indeed being a crappy way to recruit because most people are only applying via Indeed because they'll continue their unemployment benefits that way. \n\nSo, Reddit, has anyone ever heard of this kind of Indeed/Unemployment partnership? If you can't tell already, I think my manager is a little off on this subject but if I've been living under a big ol' stupid rock the last 2 years of my HR career I would like to know. \n\nThank you for your time! \n\n## Comment ID e0w81nr with +2 score by [(OkayAshley, Reddit, 2018-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/8s34e4/special_relationship_between_indeedcom_and/e0w81nr/) (in reply to ID 8s34e4):\nI would call your local unemployment office and ask them, all of the offices I’ve dealt with are super friendly!

Keep in mind Indeed is often the final stop for a job, and like any job board, those roles get cancelled often due to so many factors (like \"oh great, we found someone in-house who can do the job!).  In other words, please don't take every rejection as a rejection.  There are plenty of instances where I rejected 80 resumes because I found my guy and didn't need them anymore.  \n\nI'd go over to /r/resumes and have one of us take a look at your resume to be sure that's not hurting you.  A strong resume, good experience, Indeed.com, and a decent follow-up strategy are virtually fail-proof when looking for a job.

Even if a manager wanted to promote someone and knew it, per  company practices, union rules, etc, the position to had to be posted internally, externally, and through contractor groups for a giant company circle jerk.  \n\nRounds of interviews. People traveling from all over.  Hourly workers burning vacation to interview.  So many people would waste time and hope before the manager could pull the trigger on something they knew they wanted since day zero.\n\nAnd when the decision wasn't up to a manager, they'd still stack the deck.  Internal workers with disciplinary history, unqualified applicants, and/or fresh out of college kids would be pulled for interviews to make the pre-desired person look more attractive.  One time such an applicant was slipped the questions before hand and prepped written answers to read from... the boss was slapped on the wrist and then filed a company gag order on the employee to make sure they didn't spread the fact that they were promised the job and didn't get it.\n\nThe \"dog and pony show,' as they call it, was one of the most disgusting thing is about working there.\n\nSo if you're not pulling interviews, don't fret. Some companies just don't give a f***. Often enough, applicants spend hours to fill out the stuff on the companies application websites, if the right qualifications or a key word isn't there no human eyes will even see the product of the work put in.\n\n\nIndeed is very much a Standard, but if you can - **try to find Facebook or LinkedIn groups.** Those are good to monitor. If someone is looking for Applicants on those, they're generally more serious about hiring, looking to do it quickly, and just want a resume emailed to them  (not the whole recreate your resume line by line for their online tool). \n\nEdit: fat thumbs, and predictive text aren't my friends.\n\n#### Comment ID ddg72kr with +2 score by [(sadlittleUWstudent, Reddit, 2017-02-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5savjx/having_little_success_with_indeedcom_are_there/ddg72kr/) (in reply to ID dde9zjl):\n^^ This is amazingly true. \n\nAs a new graduate I actually had a suspiciously high amount of interviews - but for some strange reason, most people would pretend that they mis-read my resume in such a way to interpret 5 co-ops as 5 separate jobs each lasting years, even though I listed clearly that my co-ops were only a few months in duration each. \n\nA lot of my interviews would even turn into roasts - and you'd be surprised how much resources companies would (purposely?) waste on doing phantom interviews. If the company is small and has a hand-written sign-in/sign-out sheet, I'd see one person get interviewed for a full hour, then a bunch of names afterwards, including myself, getting interviewed for only ten minutes. \n\nDamn shameful.

For someone like me, who never graduated, it's been a good aid.\n\n### Comment ID dddwusx with +1 score by [(brothenberg, Reddit, 2017-02-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5savjx/having_little_success_with_indeedcom_are_there/dddwusx/) (in reply to ID dddsfbb):\nCan you share it?\n\n#### Comment ID dddytok with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2017-02-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5savjx/having_little_success_with_indeedcom_are_there/dddytok/) (in reply to ID dddwusx):\nSure!

Looks like it's free and it shouldn't be too difficult to pull down a JSON or something that can be mapped out.  \n\nYou'd also have to find a way to geocode the City/State combos to tie them to a real location...either through a third party service (which may cost), or maybe you can create your own lookup table for just  major cities.  This could actually be a pretty fun project!",

Assessments are supposed to be on the bottom of the Indeed Profile (resume) page, but they were not there.\n\nHere's the fix - If the resume on your profile is a PDF doc (or other uploaded resume), convert it to an Indeed resume. Once you do this, the assessments section will appear on the bottom of your profile page. Don't worry, it won't change any resumes that you previously submitted.\n\nOnce the assessments sections appears, it will show your scores (highly proficient, expert, etc.) You can also click on the link next to the scores to see a more detailed analysis (but not which questions you got right or wrong).\n\nAfter you do this, you can delete your Indeed formatted resume and upload your preferred resume again.\n\n### Comment ID if2dw8o with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-07-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qhfh03/cant_find_indeed_assessment_results_anymore/if2dw8o/) (in reply to ID hiwy9za):\nPinging this comment because I am having the same issue.

I understand that there are things that you would like to be clarified on this site.

I'd like you to be aware that when applying for jobs on Indeed, your actual email address is masked in an effort to protect your identity. Also, when employers reach out to you from your Indeed Resume, your email (and the employer's) is masked - usually in the form of part actual email part random numbers @indeedemail.com.\n\n>Please note that this email address is not an actual email. When you create an Indeed account, our system pulls data from your email account. The system uses the name entered on the email account at that time, to generate and create the alias you see. Employers can easily contact you by using a contact form on your public resume page without seeing your email address or any other contact information. If a prospective employer contacts you through the contact form, you will receive an email from them in your actual email inbox. Only if you choose to respond, will they be able to see your email address.\n\n>On the other side, I'd like to clarify that having this email address on your resume doesn't mean that your applications are not being sent to the employers. This is just another filter to help protect your security and all communications will still be sent directly to the actual email account associated with your Indeed account which is x@gmail.com.\n\n>I hope this is helpful!

The employers could have a million reasons, or think they have a reason that's really based in implicit bias they aren't addressing, and it's not really possible to know what exactly the problem was. \n\n I've been unemployed since October, and I'm almost considering applying and interviewing for jobs under my deadname and super uncomfortable masc presentation then just pulling the rug out from under them and coming out all over again when I get hired. (I'm sure I won't, I hate the idea of getting hired by someplace that wouldn't have hired me as myself) \n\nI don't think I'd be thinking quite the same about it if it weren't clearly the in-person interview that ended my candidacy for the last 5 jobs I had a reasonable chance of getting.\n\n## Comment ID fdg9ixp with +32 score by [(pinaeverlue, Reddit, 2020-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/el4npi/ysk_if_you_originally_made_an_indeedcom_with_your/fdg9ixp/) (in reply to ID el4npi):\n\"Masks identity\"\nHas legal name in email.\n\n## Comment ID fdg43jc with +30 score by [(I_Want_To_Dream, Reddit, 2020-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/el4npi/ysk_if_you_originally_made_an_indeedcom_with_your/fdg43jc/) (in reply to ID el4npi):\nThis is why lack of diversity in tech is a problem.

It shouldn't be that hard, it's literally changing a variable. That, and it's something that can fly under the radar- compare the number of people who use indeed, to the number of *trans* people who use indeed *that know about this* and *report it*. That's a lot smaller, and that can make something seem like it's a lot less of a problem than it really is.\n\nSo either indeed are failing a perception check and think it's not enough of a problem, or they don't give enough of a crap to allow users to change variables. Neither one paints a pretty picture of Indeed.\n\n## Comment ID fdfswmq with +6 score by [(F_uck_T_he_M_an, Reddit, 2020-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/el4npi/ysk_if_you_originally_made_an_indeedcom_with_your/fdfswmq/) (in reply to ID el4npi):\nHow can you see if it's even a different name on @indeedmail.com?\n\nI looked everywhere on the site.\n\n### Comment ID fdft1l8 with +14 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/el4npi/ysk_if_you_originally_made_an_indeedcom_with_your/fdft1l8/) (in reply to ID fdfswmq):\nthe only way i was able to tell was after hitting \"apply online\", it shows me a little receipt of my resume with my email changed to 'dead.name@indeedmail'. that was the only place i saw it. it's not present in any of the setting i looked in\n\n## Comment ID fdg49lg with +4 score by [(CoralieAdelaide, Reddit, 2020-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/el4npi/ysk_if_you_originally_made_an_indeedcom_with_your/fdg49lg/) (in reply to ID el4npi):\nThanks for the heads-up.\n\nDeadnames on Internet services seem like they'll be a difficult, crypto-battle for trans rights.

It is a skills test not an education test afterall. There's also the issue of having to wait 6 months for the retake. It's definitely not fair, but of course the big lifeless corporations side with each other. It grants them more power, and the little fledgling individuals, with something called \"emotion\", shall be left to squabble. \n\nAlso it could be that the employers are paying for indeed.com's service, so they get the luxury of more info. Also the job seeker being less informed about how well they did might make them more open to sharing the test results, because of a false confidence. This could result in the assesments being used more. Making indeed.com have more influence in the hiring process.\n\nIdk just speculating of course. They just kinda suck.

I suspect that they cannot see how many times you've taken a test. You just have to wait 6 months. Feel free to create another account with a different email if you want to retake a test sooner. If I remember correctly you have to use the score of the most recent test, so you may not want to retake it \n\nWithin the past year the test questions have not changed on me. You can even find \"study\" material online sometimes.\n\n\nProficient is currently equivalent to scoring between an A and a D (or so).  The hiring team will be able to see exactly what you've scored, but you, the job searcher, only get to see that you've done better than ~65%. So your \"proficient\" score may mean you got above 90% percent of questions right, or you did get less. They don't want us to know.\n\n\nYou may also consider posting a fake job on indeed.com (with another email). (Might not be very easy; haven't tried.) And then, of course, require the test you're interested in knowing the score of, and apply with your job searching account.\n\n#### Comment ID lc2papq with +3 score by [(Stunning_Plum_5817, Reddit, 2024-07-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/12iqrkc/is_proficient_the_highest_score_on_indeed_skill/lc2papq/) (in reply to ID jxbuvoc):\nNope - they cannot see how many times you've tried the test. It is also not possible to score any better than Proficient. Employers do not see anything other than proficient or completed. (I set up and ran my old employer's indeed account when looking for my replacement). However the candidates have a limited number of times they can retry the test. Of course it is always possible to simply create another indeed account with another email address and try over and over again until the desired outcome is achieved. The tests seem to have pretty much the same questions. They may shuffle the order that they're in, and there may be a few instances of changing out some questions, depending on the Skill. But they're pretty much the same... I've seen one (as a candidate/test taker) swap out the numbers for a math skill test. Same phrasing, different variables and thus a different answer. But same principle (solve for x, determine midpoint, etc., etc.,). So copying and pasting questions looking online for the answer wont always work.\n\n### Comment ID kv0x77a with +2 score by [(DoctorImportant6339, Reddit, 2024-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/12iqrkc/is_proficient_the_highest_score_on_indeed_skill/kv0x77a/) (in reply to ID jgslczo):\nJob boards are like a hunting safari \n\n​Job boards need revenue.

The skill levels on Indeed assessments typically include Beginner, Intermediate, Proficient, and Expert. \"Expert\" is generally considered the highest skill level.

There was also a question with a 4 minute time limit which I completed in about 30 seconds and then I went to the bathroom lol.\n\nIf I would have known that 380/800 was \"Proficient\" and the total time was tracked, I could have just guessed immediately on the questions I had little confidence in... I probably got at least 80% of the questions right even though I had to guess on a few and I figure I missed those ones...\n\nI am now worried about the fact that it took me 80 minutes to compete a \"40 minute\" test when I probably could have just guessed on the most difficult questions and finished the test much faster without really impacting my score very much...\n\n## Comment ID kp2tozb with +2 score by [(ImKnownAsJoe, Reddit, 2024-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/12iqrkc/is_proficient_the_highest_score_on_indeed_skill/kp2tozb/) (in reply to ID 12iqrkc):\nThis is from the Indeed For Employers page, \"Hiring Resources:\"\n\n\"Indeed Assessments score levels are Proficient and Completed.

Because assessments are not accurate portraits of ability, and Indeed was getting in hot water because they do not employ people who professionally assets the skills the assessments are created to assets, it's legally safer for them to issue it as pass/fail. In general, assessments are not a good indicator of ability because they have the same issues standardized tests have.\n\n## Comment ID ldau0ce with +2 score by [(Rhoaric, Reddit, 2024-07-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/12iqrkc/is_proficient_the_highest_score_on_indeed_skill/ldau0ce/) (in reply to ID 12iqrkc):\nWe have asked our Indeed rep if we could see the test in order to vet the \"proficiency\" ourselves, but we were told that it would significantly skew the results of our assessment with individual candidates. We will be taking the test as a \"candidate\" ourselves to find out how comprehensive they are. I really am at a loss about their gatekeeping of skills tests.

Also, there's a HUGE difference between a score of 380 and 800, and to wrap that up in one rating is absolutely stupid. And like many have said, what IF the employers see the score and we can't? Like one commenter said: \"Indeed helps people get rejected from jobs.\" \n\n  \nNot only that, but companies are going to start using AI to conduct interviews (and many already have). Which means it saves them money on time spent evaluating potential new hires, while jobseekers still have to dedicate time and energy to show up and perform perfectly time after time after time. \n\nI have a pretty unique idea for a new kind of job search platform that will favor jobseekers over employers just slightly enough to give the jobseekers a bit more advantage and save time finding a job.

They make money from the business that is looking for a qualified candidate. They also don't want to alienate all of the potential candidates by showing them poor scores. The old saying is true.

I believe they updated their system to have just the 2 options now. Especially if you look at the actual grading. There is a large gap between the minimal proficient end and the higher end. It could depend on the area, since I am seeing quite a few people commenting they still have the expert and highly proficient options? I freaked out as well when I first noticed and was about to retake EVERY assessment just to be sure lol. What I am wondering though is if the employers get the actual grade and not just proficient on their end.

Or are ghost job listings. Anything labeled as a sales representative is most likely for a life insurance company where u work on commission only and you MIGHT see anywhere from 60k to 200k a year. But it requires cold calling and playing telemarketer at the end of the day. \n\nSecondly about indeed, the fucking skills assessment tests. Apparently you can reset a skills test and retake it. Which i did because companies that require you to take them will have an auto-filter if you score poorly.\n\nThe legal skills test is actually available on quizlet for anybody like me applying for legal assistant/paralegal positions. \n\nBoth suck though. Jobs labeling positions as entry-level but are requiring 5 years previous experience, a bachelors, but lists their pay being below $20/hr. Those companies are wanting to have their cake and eat it too. \n\nSo for a recent college grad, it makes me think that they 1) want to get away with paying somebody lower than their actual worth. 2) don’t want to have the responsibility of training somebody who is actually new.\n\n## Comment ID j7ew9og with +1 score by [(its_a_throwawayduh, Reddit, 2023-02-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/10ufp5w/linkedin_vs_indeed/j7ew9og/) (in reply to ID 10ufp5w):\nUnfortunately with the job market and how desperate people are scams are unavoidable.

Hoping this can help out a bit!\n\nFor me, I 100% prefer LinkedIn IF AND ONLY IF your profile is updated based on your employment, education, and skills. LinkedIn recommends me jobs based on the skills on my profile and past experience (I work in a hotel and graduated with a finance degree from college last May) - so I get jobs recommended to me like financial analyst positions or front office manager positions.\n\nI have used Indeed before and got an interview off it, but never used it much since I landed my last job. Indeed has gotten better over the years but I very seldom use it. Every time I import my resume to create my profile it would mess up the format to the point where I wouldn't trust sending any apps out on their site. Indeed is easier for convenience but may not give the recruiter an idea of who you are (unlike LinkedIn).\n\nIn terms of scams, they are kinda all over the place regardless of where you go. Just watch out for red flags (getting an immediate offer with no interview, salary too good to be true, etc...)\n\nAlso, with LinkedIn you may be able to get in contact with the job poster (recruiter). This makes it easier to follow up or inquire about any openings on the company that may not be directly advertised. Indeed is more anonymous and you're kinda waiting more in the dark.\n\nBest way to get a job? Networking. Connect with classmates, graduates, family members, and reach out to them. I am working with my uncle to see if I can land an insurance job in the summer. Don't be afraid to reach out, you never know what may happen!\n\n## Comment ID jss8ll2 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/10ufp5w/linkedin_vs_indeed/jss8ll2/) (in reply to ID 10ufp5w):\nIndeed is like a black hole for me.

I had a total of 55 applications for my position.  One of my questions before a candidate could submit their resume was \"How many years of experience do you have?\".  \n\nSince indeed sends you resumes as attachments, I checked out a few candidate resumes in my email.  Later in the morning I logged in and used a filter to isolate the people with 7 or more years of experience.  I noticed that the 3 candidates that caught my eye in my email did not show up on the list.  I thought it was something I was doing wrong so I reset the filter and tried again, this time only selecting one filter option \"10+\".  Still those candidates which had answered the question with 12 & 13 years did not come up.  \n\nI started to realize the problem wasn't me.  I reset it again but this time I selected all the filter options \\[from 0 years experience to 10+\\].  Since I selected all the options I should have a list with all 55 candidates.  However, I had a list of 37 candidates -- literally, 18 people just didn't exist once I used the filter.\n\nI called indeed support and spoke with a rep.  She logged into my account and replicated what I did with the same results.  She apologized and claimed that this was a beta feature and only 10&#37; of employers have access to this feature.  Filtering is in beta?  WTF?  Firstly, I'm not buying that something as standard as a \"years of experience\" filter is only now being introduced to indeed and secondly, why is it not labeled as such so employers know not to use it or to expect undesirable behavior.\n\nI'm just writing this post to make employers and job seekers alike aware.  If you're an employer, you might be missing some valuable people if you're using an indeed filter.  If you're a job seeker, you may not even be seen by the employers.\n\n## Comment ID e29giqz with +103 score by [(midniteslayr, Reddit, 2018-07-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yaffi/major_indeedcom_filter_flaw_affects_employers_and/e29giqz/) (in reply to ID 8yaffi):\nTheir commercials on TV advertise their filtering options.

Don’t let this aggravate you too much. I can receive 50 applicants for one job and I stop after I find one I like. I might ignore 47 other applications. Or reserve them for a later need and move on.

When you apply for a job, the employer receives an email with your name and resume as an attachment. If they view your resume through that attachment, you’ll never know. The other way is if the employer views your resume through their dashboard. The dash gives them your cover letter and resume but usually in a plain view without formatting. If they view it this way, you will never know. The last method is if they go into the dashboard and click “download resume”. This download resume option gives them your resume in the original format you sent it in (ie: word/pdf) and this is the only method that triggers an alert to the applicant.  However, this is the same file that is emailed to them when you first apply, so if they viewed that one, there might be no reason for them to ever click the download option. \n\nSo just because you didn’t get an alert doesn’t mean they didn’t see it. However, it also doesn’t mean they did see it.\n\n#### Comment ID e5fepoi with +1 score by [(SheWhoCreates, Reddit, 2018-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yaffi/major_indeedcom_filter_flaw_affects_employers_and/e5fepoi/) (in reply to ID e5faft9):\nGotcha, thank you for explaining! What do you think I should do? How can I get my resume on their dashboard? Do you think I should write a cover letter for each job I apply to, even if they don't ask for one?

A cover letter is always a good idea. Depending on the job and location an employer could get a hundred or more responses to a job but less than half submit a cover letter.  There’s a chance an employer will stop looking through resumes once they find 5-7 qualified candidates.  If you have a cover letter, there’s a better chance you get looked at since the cover letter should highlight your qualifications. This in turn may get the employer interested enough to open your resume.\n\n## Comment ID lra6kdx with +1 score by [(jallisy, Reddit, 2024-10-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yaffi/major_indeedcom_filter_flaw_affects_employers_and/lra6kdx/) (in reply to ID 8yaffi):\nIndeed.com - I had a similar experience, but from a job seeker perspective.

The target generating system is broken, people are making record breaking amounts of sales and are still not getting close to targets. Room for growth is almost non existent now. Directors will try to stop you from leaving to try and benefit themselves. Work life balance is awful when there is a broken target system causing stress and uncertainty for each new quarter.",

Everyone I know that's left is miserable and most are trying to get out. \n\nPros:\n-Free lunch buffet with pretty good food\n-Baristas in offices that make free custom coffees, smoothies, and juices\n-Fully stocked snack pantries and drink fridges on every floor\n-Generous flexible PTO policy (depending on your team)\n-Better-than-average awareness of social issues and encouragement to learn and honor others\n-Several of my managers were incredible and I would follow them anywhere. Top tier people.\n-Many of my colleagues were genuinely some of the best people I've ever met and really care about helping people get jobs.\n-Generous bonuses if you performed well",

If your experience is like mine, expect your DM to make you do their job: resource planning, meeting organization, it's all ad hoc and delegated. DMs are glorified performance reviewers, and it's pretty clear they're being directed to squeeze performance reviews to find excuses to fire or hold back good engineers to avoid more layoffs, like all the big tech companies.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech stack is a mess. It's honestly baffling in 2024...it's something I would have considered obsolete in 2014. There's no time for tech debt, though, because management is so bad at managing projects that everyone is just working on experimental projects that are desperately guessing at ways to improve UX, the vast majority of which fail, wasting months of work. That makes sense for Google, who basically admitted 10 years ago that they'd peaked. Every app does eventually. But you shouldn't hire for growth if you aren't growing.",

Siloes are created and some managers use that as a tactic to divide team members and support some more than others or not at all. Career growth is associated with who your manager is and whether they really want to support you or not. Some middle managers have too much control over employee advancement and directors look the other way or aren’t present at all. At first Indeed valued culture and diversity but that has also been tainted by individuals in middle management. My former team is now all white women, mostly of a certain age with similar backgrounds and lifestyles. Only one man remains and one person of color who’s a contractor.",

It's honestly baffling in 2024...it's something I would have considered obsolete in 2014. There's no time for tech debt, though, because management is so bad at managing projects that everyone is just working on experimental projects that are desperately guessing at ways to improve UX, the vast majority of which fail, wasting months of work.

      "# [Indeed to lay off 1,000 employees on 2024-05-14](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/)\nThe job website Indeed, which has headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut and Austin, Texas, is laying off around 1,000 people, which is around 8 percent of the company.\n\nNo information has been released on how many jobs in Connecticut will be affected.\n\n“I am sad to share the news that we have made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount through a layoff. Unlike last year, where our reduction was driven by cost savings, we are taking this action because we need to simplify our organization to make it easier and faster for us to make decisions, and help us to more effectively grow revenue and hires,” Indeed CEO Chris Hyams said in a statement that was shared with employees.\n\nIndeed said that the company maintains a co-headquarters in Stamford and there are no changes to the real estate footprint as a result of the announcement.\n\n“Indeed remains committed to Connecticut. The state continues to be very business friendly, with strong support for our workforce and users - job seekers and employers. Additionally, Stamford is still a key sales office for Indeed, and integral to Indeed’s long-term plans,” Indeed said in a statement.\n\n“While the reductions touch many groups and regions, they are not across the board like last year; rather they are mostly concentrated in the US, and are more focused on R&D and some Go-to-Market teams. We worked closely with the HR, Legal, and DEIB+ teams to ensure objectivity and equity in the decision-making process. The final selections have had no measurably disproportionate impact on women and under-represented genders or the under-represented minority population in the US,” Hyams told employees.\n\nIn 2017, Indeed executives and then-Gov. Dannel Malloy announced that the company was expanding its Stamford offices and bringing in hundreds of employees to have a total of more than 1,200 employees in Connecticut.\n\nLocal\n\nIn June 2020, as the state was reopening after the pandemic business closings, Indeed partnered with the state on a custom jobs portal for jobseekers and employers looking for opportunities to get back to reopen and get back to work.\n\nFollowing is the full statement from the CEO:\n\nA Message from our CEO, Chris Hyams\n\n\"I am sad to share the news that we have made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount through a layoff. Unlike last year, where our reduction was driven by cost savings, we are taking this action because we need to simplify our organization to make it easier and faster for us to make decisions, and help us to more effectively grow revenue and hires.\n\n\"We anticipate that we will be letting approximately 1,000 people go, representing ~8% of the company. While the reductions touch many groups and regions, they are not across the board like last year; rather they are mostly concentrated in the US, and are more focused on R&D and some Go-to-Market teams. We worked closely with the HR, Legal, and DEIB+ teams to ensure objectivity and equity in the decision-making process. The final selections have had no measurably disproportionate impact on women and under-represented genders or the under-represented minority population in the US.\n\n\"Within the hour, employees outside of Ireland, the UK, and Australia will hear whether or not you have been impacted by this decision. If you are impacted, your email will include a link to the details of your separation package, which will vary by region. Package amounts have been increased for most employees over last year, and include severance, healthcare payment where applicable, and outplacement services, among others. Employees in Ireland, the UK, and Australia will hear within the hour whether you will be entering into the consultation process.\n\n\"I am responsible for how we got here, and the entire SLT is responsible for making the difficult decisions necessary to help set us up for the future. We know these decisions will have a significant impact on people’s lives. I’d like to share some context for why I believe it’s necessary.\n\n\"Last year we were facing a global slowdown in hiring, which led to multiple consecutive quarters of revenue loss. We reduced our headcount, instituted multiple cost-saving measures, and instilled investment discipline across the company. These measures worked, and we are now operating with stable profitability.\n\n\"However, while the global economy has improved in several areas over the past year, we are not yet set up for sustainable growth. Despite our efforts so far, our organization is still too complex, we still have significant duplication of effort and too many organizational layers that slow down decision-making. We have been working to simplify every aspect of our business, but without meaningful change, we can’t get where we need to go.\n\n\"At a high level, we are significantly restructuring the R&D team to align with our marketplace strategy, and we are reducing layers of management. We are also restructuring and aligning some Go-to-Market teams, and will be eliminating most of the Sales and CS roles in Foster City, California. Across the business we are making additional changes to simplify decision-making and create clarity.\n\n\"For those who are staying, I know you will need time to absorb this news. Tomorrow we will have a global town hall where I will share more about the overall org structure. This will be followed by org-specific town halls led by SLT, with opportunities to get answers to your questions. On Wednesday, we will share the updated organization chart for everyone to see.\n\n\"As difficult as these changes are, our new structure will help us to simplify and work more effectively as one team, reignite growth in revenue, and drive toward our 2030 goal to help 100 million people get jobs.\n\n\"But today, our focus will be on those who are leaving.\n\n\"Our mission is vital. Helping people get jobs is a profound privilege. Our work is driven by the deep understanding of just how important a job is in a person’s life. We all know what it means to lose that. For those of you who are leaving, this is incredibly hard. We are committed to bringing as much support to you as possible in the days and weeks ahead. You helped millions of people get jobs, and helped Indeed to be a better place. Thank you.\"",
      "# [Indeed lays off 1K employees, citing ‘global slow-down’ in hiring by Kathryn Moody on 2024-05-15](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/)\nThis audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.\n\nIndeed laid off approximately 1,000 employees Monday, or about 8% of the company, Indeed CEO Chris Hyams announced May 13 in a letter to employees, a move driven in part by “a global slow-down in hiring,” the message said.\n\nThe vast majority of the layoffs were in the U.S., Hyams said, largely within R&D and the go-to-market teams.\n\n“While the global economy has improved in several areas over the past year, we are not yet set up for sustainable growth,” Hyams said. “Despite our efforts so far, our organization is still too complex,” he continued, indicating that the company is aiming to “simplify” areas of the business to make decision-making faster.\n\nIndeed laid off about 15% of its workforce in March of last year, or around 2,200 people, in response to tanking job postings. Hyams also took a reduction in base pay at that time.\n\nThose measures worked, he said, and Indeed is operating with stable profitability but now needs to “reignite growth.” Notably, the company flubbed the roll-out of one of its more experimental payment schemes since the start of the pandemic, stakeholders said previously told HR Dive. Pay per application, which would have allowed employers only to pay for accepted applications from approved candidates, ran into a number of roadblocks with clients when it was first rolled out in 2022. For example, many small businesses did not have the capacity to handle approval of applications before they would be billed in the thousands, one expert said at the time.",

    "# Indeed Company and Product Report\n\n## Company Overview\n\nIndeed is a prominent job search website headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and Austin, Texas. The company has been a significant player in the online job market, providing a platform for job seekers and employers to connect. As of May 2024, Indeed is undergoing a significant restructuring, which includes laying off approximately 1,000 employees, representing about 8% of its workforce [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/). This decision comes after a previous layoff of around 2,200 employees in March 2023, which accounted for 15% of the workforce, due to a downturn in job postings [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Layoffs and Restructuring\n\nIndeed's recent layoffs are primarily concentrated in the U.S., particularly within the Research & Development (R&D) and Go-to-Market teams. CEO Chris Hyams stated that the layoffs are part of a strategy to simplify the organization and improve decision-making processes, which he described as currently \"too complex\" [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/). Hyams emphasized the need to \"reignite growth\" and align the company with its marketplace strategy, indicating that the restructuring aims to create a more efficient operational framework [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/).\n\n### Commitment to Connecticut\n\nDespite the layoffs, Indeed has reaffirmed its commitment to Connecticut, where it maintains a co-headquarters. The company has stated that there will be no changes to its real estate footprint in the state, highlighting Stamford as a key sales office integral to its long-term plans [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/).\n\n## Product Overview\n\nIndeed's primary product is its job search platform, which connects millions of job seekers with employers. The platform has been instrumental in helping individuals find employment opportunities and has played a vital role in the job market, especially during economic downturns. In June 2020, Indeed partnered with the state of Connecticut to create a custom jobs portal aimed at assisting job seekers and employers during the pandemic [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/).\n\n### Challenges and Innovations\n\nIndeed has faced challenges with some of its product offerings, particularly with the rollout of a new payment scheme called \"pay per application.\" This model, which was intended to allow employers to pay only for accepted applications, encountered difficulties, especially for small businesses that struggled with the approval process [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/). Such challenges highlight the complexities involved in innovating within the competitive job search market.\n\n## Executive Insights\n\nCEO Chris Hyams has been vocal about the company's current challenges and the rationale behind the layoffs. In his statement, he acknowledged the emotional impact of these decisions on employees and emphasized the company's mission to help people find jobs, which he described as a \"profound privilege\" [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/). Hyams's leadership during this restructuring phase will be critical in navigating Indeed toward sustainable growth.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIndeed is currently at a pivotal moment, facing significant restructuring and layoffs while striving to simplify its operations and reignite growth. The company's commitment to its Connecticut headquarters and its ongoing efforts to innovate its job search platform will be crucial as it adapts to the evolving job market landscape. Prospective candidates and investors should closely monitor these developments, as they will likely influence Indeed's future performance and market position."
