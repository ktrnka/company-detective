  "summary_markdown": "# About Indeed\n\nIndeed is a leading job search platform that connects employers with job seekers, facilitating the hiring process across various industries. The company is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and Austin, Texas. Indeed was founded in 2004 and has grown to become a vital resource for recruitment, providing tools and insights to enhance the hiring process.\n\nAs of May 2024, Indeed has undergone significant organizational changes, including layoffs affecting approximately 1,000 employees, which represents about 8% of its workforce [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/). This follows a previous layoff of around 2,200 employees in March 2023, accounting for 15% of the company [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/).\n\nIndeed offers a variety of services for employers, including job posting and management, access to insightful data such as average salaries for similar jobs, information on job seeker interest and competing employers, and tools for crafting compelling job descriptions. The platform provides a dashboard for employers to manage their job listings and access valuable analytics to improve their hiring strategies.\n\nIndeed serves a wide range of customers, from small businesses to large corporations, helping them find qualified candidates efficiently. The company operates on a B2B model, generating revenue through services offered to employers.\n\nDespite recent layoffs, Indeed has reported stable profitability following previous cost-saving measures. The company aims to streamline operations to better serve its mission of helping 100 million people find jobs by 2030 [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nChris Hyams is the CEO of Indeed. He has been involved in leading the company through recent organizational changes, including significant layoffs. Hyams has emphasized the need for the company to simplify its structure and improve decision-making processes to reignite growth and align with its marketplace strategy [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/).\n\n# News\n\n## Recent Layoffs and Organizational Changes\n\nIndeed has recently laid off approximately 1,000 employees, primarily in the United States, within the Research & Development (R&D) and Go-to-Market teams. This decision is part of a strategy to simplify the organization and improve decision-making processes [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/). The layoffs follow a previous reduction of 2,200 employees in March 2023 [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/).\n\n## Financial Performance and Market Position\n\nDespite the layoffs, Indeed has maintained stable profitability. CEO Chris Hyams noted that while the global economy has shown signs of improvement, the company is still not positioned for sustainable growth, necessitating these organizational changes [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/).\n\n## Product Developments and Challenges\n\nIndeed's product offerings include a range of tools for job seekers and employers. However, the company has faced challenges with some of its experimental payment schemes, such as the \"pay per application\" model, which encountered difficulties during its rollout in 2022 [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/).\n\n## Commitment to Community and Workforce\n\nIndeed has reiterated its commitment to its Connecticut headquarters and the local workforce, despite the layoffs. The company has previously partnered with the state of Connecticut to create a custom jobs portal during the pandemic [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/).\n\n## Executive Insights\n\nCEO Chris Hyams expressed the emotional weight of the decision to lay off employees, acknowledging the impact on employees' lives and emphasizing the company's mission to help people find jobs [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIndeed is navigating a challenging landscape marked by workforce reductions and the need for organizational simplification. While the company has achieved stable profitability, it faces ongoing challenges in aligning its product offerings with market demands. Prospective candidates and investors should consider these factors when evaluating Indeed's future potential and stability in the job search market.",

Looks like it's free and it shouldn't be too difficult to pull down a JSON or something that can be mapped out.  \n\nYou'd also have to find a way to geocode the City/State combos to tie them to a real location...either through a third party service (which may cost), or maybe you can create your own lookup table for just  major cities.

      "# Post ID r4e6rh: The ugly truth of Indeed. An HR viewpoint with +4259 score by [(blaq_sheep90, Reddit, 2021-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/)\nI've spent years on both sides of using Indeed. Here is everything you need to know. May apply to other job sites.\n\nIndeed is just a glorified parasite of a website and most of the jobs you find on there are false doors. Indeed works by scraping hundreds or thousands of other websites for real job postings, and recreates the information as a new job in its own format. An overwhelming majority of jobs posted here are clones. Applying to these cloned jobs does absolutely nothing. Nobody receives your information. They are a fake-it-until-they-made-it success story of sharing near false information to draw the crowd and then charge companies for legitimate direct postings and charge recruiters for access to applicant resumes and information.\n\nYes, you can still find some legitimate postings on here for success. Consider closer looks at sponsored positions. Companies pay for these specific listings to show at the top of your search, so there is more likely someone on the other end going through those applications. \n\nFor non-sponsored jobs, read through the description to see if it gives explicit instructions about applying through Indeed. The quick apply button doesn't count. \n\nDon't apply to anything more than two weeks old. If the posting is being monitored, it may be nearly filled, overrun with applications, or focus has moved from checking this posting to another (we are human after all). Old and filled postings are nearly impossible to take down, so most are just left to time out through the site. This takes around six weeks.\n\nUse indeed as a resource to find job postings, but then go directly to a company's website to search for the job and apply directly with them. You'll get much more information about the company and the role (if it is still vacant), and increase your odds that an actual person sees your resume. \n\nSpeaking of resumes, do NOT use Indeed's resumes to apply to anything. Ever. They are terrible. Sure, they are better than nothing, but they likely share more information than you want to, are not tailored for anything, and show you lack any computer skills or creativity. \n\nIndeed and similar sites can be beneficial, but as with most things on the internet, be skeptical.\n\nHopefully this gets you out of recruiting hell.\n\n## Comment ID hmg9jtw with +607 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmg9jtw/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThank you for your post.

There are options to approve, reject, do nothing, or even \"?\" an applicant if you want to revist their application later, but every time I do one of those things that candidate goes from \"awaiting review\" to \"reviewed.\" I'm guessing that prospective employees see that their application has moved from awaiting review to reviewed. If an employer is responsible then if they've reviewed and rejected your application then you should get an automated email saying so.  \n\n\nAlso, I know this is 8 mos ago, but please let me know if you have any more questions about the employer side of Indeed.

About 40 applicants to each position; once we culled the utterly irrelevant applicants we had about 20 and have got a handful of decent applicants. I'll be interviewing a few next week. \n\nFrom the *applicant* side though, I've felt something's fishy. I just *keep seeing* the same positions from the same large companies week after week after week - and I know in my industry in this market there's no fucking chance those positions are unfillable. I'd assumed someone was just farming resumes for some reason; I hadn't considered that LinkedIn itself was scraping them to make itself look prettier. \n\nI guess the telling factors are \n\n* Is this position over 2 weeks old? If so, the company would have gotten what it wants already unless whatever they're hiring for is *seriously* specific. \n* Is this the second or third time you've seen the same job posting? If so, it's probably automatically created and goes nowhere. \n* The smaller the company, the more likely it is to not be autogenerated?\n\n## Comment ID hmhvwkk with +13 score by [(Legal_Proposal_6621, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmhvwkk/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nIndeed is becoming like the tinder of jobs.

Recruiters can be beneficial. Reach out to specific individual recruiters that have an industry specialty. Avoid the recruiting companies unless you're desperate.

I removed myself from Indeed after all Indeed-related emails I got from recruiters were completely spammy or worse, low-balled on rates so it seemed clear they were only seeking to justify Americans turning job applications down so they could bring in foreign labor.\n\nIn one case, the recruiter used a four year old Microsoft job req now long gone but matched it to my old Indeed resume on the basis of keywords.\n\nI find that recruiters often do not actually have my resume, they have the ATS scrapers like Ceipal  that send them candidate addresses. I learned this seeing multiple times when recruiter referenced Indeed resume from which I long ago removed certain keyword terms, but had never read my resume.\n\nAlso, I long ago removed my phone number from resumes posted online and yet I continually get calls (at least 10-20 a week) from New Jersey agencies using offshore recruiters. Clearly the databases used have been scraped years ago, and likely that sites like Indeed still keep obsolete resumes from deleted accounts.

A lot of their skills and keywords got entered into the talent database profile so it’s highly likely that random recruiters you talked to years ago still have only the old resume on file unless they received a new one to update it. Fancier companies might auto update resumes in their CRM from indeed and LinkedIn but I believe ours was manual each time we worked with a candidate we would update the res on file.

However, I encounter very many bad recruiters with questionable data sources and are tiny (one-man I am guessing) new companies, not any of the old-line tech recruiting agencies. Some I suspect previously worked at a bigger agency, scraped their database there, then jumped ship to start their own shop.\n\nFor reasons I still don't understand causality for, a whole lot of such agencies are in New Jersey, and many use ATS services like Ceipal. My guess is the advent of these automated suppliers has opened up an era of zero-effort to get into recruiting, and makes use maybe of Ceipal-like services that possibly steal databases. So now maybe anyone with coin can open up an agency with no research required for candidates, and they run a numbers game spamming. Now, in my daily flood of email from recruiters, if the agency is obviously miniscule and new and the recruiter is Indian, I discard it as  spam because experience over the last year.\n\n## Comment ID hmht8l1 with +5 score by [(itsrattlesnake, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmht8l1/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\n> Don't apply to anything more than two weeks old.\n\nOvertime I learned this.

Ever. They are terrible. Sure, they are better than nothing, but they likely share more information than you want to, are not tailored for anything, and show you lack any computer skills or creativity.\n\nDepends, I've recruited for 6 years and I've worked for old school employers who care about something tailored. I've also worked for employers that just need the information and don't care - especially if its a high demand field. It just depends on where you're looking to work. Generally its better to have an actual resume that isn't cookie cutter, but I don't believe it truly hurts your chances unless your indeed resume looks like its garbage with a bunch of spelling errors. \n\nIndeed all around is the worst. Its clunky, servers get overwhelmed too quickly, and the price to have a posting show in the first few pages is getting more and more expensive. Its astronomical now. It'd be better if everyone moved to a different platform so employers could take the money they're using on indeed ads and reachouts and just pay employees more so they'll stay.\n\n## Comment ID hmh0tel with +3 score by [(cybernewtype2, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmh0tel/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThis has been my experience as well.

They changed all the formatting to this really basic ugly style but said it would be accepted by automated systems much easier. And I genuinely got a significantly higher response rate after using the new ugly resume. \n\nFrom a hiring manager perspective, sometimes Indeed sends you hundreds or thousands of candidates and it can be completely overwhelming if your job is not a full time recruiter and you’re not looking to use recruiters. \n\nIf you don’t have automated systems in place to scan the resumes, then a lot of it is manual. I’m almost embarrassed about how long this took me, but I tried to be very thorough. I recently went through about 45 developer resumes for an open position and that took me a solid 4 hours. I had to manually download each resume and ctrl-f all the skills I was looking for then dig deeper into the ones that had the tech skills to get into their work history.\n\nIf a small company receives a buttload of candidates it may be just one person reviewing them who has other job duties to take care of. Job posts that are a few weeks old aren’t always the dealbreaker people think they are and aren’t necessarily a sign that the whole interview process will be slow or that no one wants the job. Once we’ve done the first interview we schedule all remaining ones for that person and have a decision in a matter of days.\n\n## Comment ID hmhrhz5 with +3 score by [(Bengerm77, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmhrhz5/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nI've wasted so much time on there.

I like to enter in things I've done recently first and then go back from there.\n\nFor example, you might have recently worked at a tire shop or something so you could say something like \"repaired/replaced car tires\"\n\"Checked/changed car oil and filter\"\n\"Drove various makes and model of customer vehicles through tight spaces\"\n\"Inventoried and transported several pounds of heavy cargo by dolly\"\n\nBasically tasks you are familiar with within your previous jobs and can say you've done enough times to not mess it up.  You can also add in independent work like mowing lawns, house repairs, ect.  Try to avoid adding complicated/niche work that you've only done a passable job of once or twice unless you are really confident you could do it again in a professional setting.\n\nNext, you add the job you did that task next to it (one square over in my case) at or \"freelance\" if it was something you did outside of a formal job.\n\nNext, add rough time frames that you did those things.  I try to get at least the years right and then if I can remember the months and days, I'll add those too.  The numbers here can be annotated with question marks or left blank if I'm not sure and need to check later.  This isn't what's going to the employer anyway, it's organizing for a tailored resume to be made later.\n\nDo these until you need a break and save it to a readily accessible computer or phone.  Come back and add more whenever you can think of it.  The most I've seen someone need to go back is 10 years or so.\n\nNow, when you apply for a job, get ahold of the job description, pull up this list you made, and grab whichever tasks you can match the words up with, some rewording may be needed.  Contact details at the top, relevant jobs with the relevant tasks next, relevant certifications and schooling after, preferred contact point and short, cordial note at the bottom expressing your looking forward to the interview.  (That last bit is my experience of confidence getting you places you have no sound reason to be)\n\nIf you had \"irrelevant\" jobs in the gaps between your chosen relevant jobs and tasks, you can just add the place of employment and an accurate job title but otherwise leave it at that.  Try to keep your employment history from having gaps but don't volunteer more than you need.  It's just clutter for most people and can get you blindsided if someone takes an interest in otherwise unrelated information.\n\n### Comment ID kuazmsr with +1 score by [(v0lume4, Reddit, 2024-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/kuazmsr/) (in reply to ID hmguq9f):\nGreat answer.\n\n## Comment ID hmhgbp6 with +4 score by [(LindzwithaphOG, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmhgbp6/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nAlso, if you applied to your current job through Indeed, your current HR department can tell if you are applying to other jobs.\n\n## Comment ID hmhdn6l with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmhdn6l/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nI found my 2nd job on this website but my 2nd job was shit.

LinkedIn is usually second.\n\nIf there's a link to the company's website, apply. Usually Quick Apply is an integration with an ATS, I think, so apply. If those things aren't there, find the company's website and see if the job is posted and if it's a legit company.\n\nThe main advantage of applying through the company's website is you get to answer everything that they want so your profile isn't missing anything they deemed important. Granted, that can totally suck too, can we say 30 minute assessment test, yuck.\n\nThe age of a job posting comes into play only when it's for high volume positions (typically the entry level type jobs or the ones that are saturated - you should know if it is or not). Don't NOT apply because some random person on the internet said you are wasting your time. Again, it all depends on the type of job. \n\nYou should know if you're in the high volume, niche, hard to find, etc category. Once you understand the market for your job and your skills, then you'll understand the game better and know when to apply and when not to.\n\nI applied 2.5 weeks in and beat out about 100 applicants because I knew I had everything they were looking for and everything they know they wanted but didn't list because that would narrow down the pool too much. If I wasn't a perfect fit, I probably wouldn't have applied.\n\n## Comment ID hms0ogx with +2 score by [(loki444, Reddit, 2021-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hms0ogx/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThis is great information.

Informative, but not busy or bulky. Your job titles, company, and dates should stand out at the first glance. Recruiters spend 5-10 seconds looking at a resume and should be able to see those first.\n\nPersonalization is good, but designs or colors shouldn't distract from the actual written content. \n\nWrite the details of your employment history as a mix of job description and highlighting accomplishments. \n\nThere are tons of resources on Google images or YouTube to get ideas of putting yours together. Good luck out there!\n\n#### Comment ID izs2oy6 with +2 score by [(Maleficent_Ad2457, Reddit, 2022-12-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/izs2oy6/) (in reply to ID izryrif):\nThank you kindly for the advice.

Why do you need their resume to have creativity to perform the job description you listed? Is being able to create an indeed account, use its features, and applying to your job online not enough for computer skills? What does typing in a Google doc vs using an indeed resume say about computer skills at the end of the day? \n\nIf the job requires computer skills I'm sure the resume will list their qualifications regardless.

PLEASE do go directly to the employer and apply there. It also gives you a chance to see if the position is still posted and if it is a real posting.  Most jobs are filled in 30-days. If it is still open, there are tons of applicants already overwhelming the employer. A recruiter only needs a few good applicants to submitted to the hiring manager. The rest of the resumes/applications are never seen. \n\nI second the motion, if you have Indeed to create a resume for you, it is not at all professional, and they all look the same (elementary). Also, keep in mind Indeed is also running a recruitment business themselves; your information is now in their hands to have access to you and your details. You are now in their ATS (applicant tracking system). A lot has changed with the Indeed posting site. It is not what is used to be. There was a time when only well-known employers posted. There are a lot of businesses you have never heard of on there now. Unknown business postings/small operations are big money for Indeed, many are considered staffing agencies in their eyes.

In my last interactions with our account representative, I inquired about any projected price increases so I could submit my department's annual budget to the finance team. He said none were planned, and we transitioned into the predicted \"spend more money for better results\" convo that he constantly drones on about citing Indeed's biased data that, of course, connects recruitment success to increased consumer spending whenever he has my ear. I told him that the $5 a day per posting works well for us, and we continuously maintain the lowest vacancy rate in our industry. I submit our budget to our finance team; then the next day, Indeed forces us to spend at least $9 a day per posting. To my knowledge, before this convo, there was no cost minimum. There have been other instances where we discuss a feature, and then the next thing I know, it only becomes available if you spend an exuberant amount of money a day. With this forced increase in recruitment cost, there has been no change in our recruitment results, contrary to their \"studies.\" \n\nI am 150% positive the representatives are rewarded for their ability to force us to spend more. It is in any professional's interest who conducts business with them not to give their representative any information on how they use Indeed for recruiting. They will turn off the features discussed and force you to pay more to continue using them. \n\nThe representative is dense and does not understand we are a government-funded nonprofit that provides supports to disabled adults. CA's current governor has been throwing our industry under the bus year after year regarding funding disabled services when approving the annual budget. We don't have the means to spend the recommended minimum of $67 per day for each listing. I repeat this like a broken record, over and over and over and over and over... to the point I *HATE* talking to him. Repeating myself is my biggest peeve.

Indeed is a good source of information, but not the total package it says it is. \n\nPost-pandemic recruiting research is limited, and will be for a few more years, but there are more trends leaning towards smaller scale recruiting efforts like targeting advertising toward professional groups (like shrm to fill an hr vacancy) and referral bonuses are becoming more common, too. \n\nAs a nonprofit, you may be better off saving your dollars and trying other free sources like college career centers, govt services, religious orgs, ect.

Director of TA here. We use Indeed heavily at my current company and have done so at previous Fortune 500 companies. \n\nI don’t love Indeed, but it’s not a scam. Companies post and sponsor jobs on Indeed because of the sheer volume of candidates. Indeed has more traffic (people) than the next 7 largest job boards combined. We spend a lot of money and time managing our Indeed postings. \n\nRoughly half of our hires come from Indeed. This is a mix of positions from professional to manufacturing to retail to sales. For professional positions we post and source from LinkedIn as well. \n\nIt’s also for a company to be integrated with Indeed so if you apply on Indeed, your application actually goes I to the company’s applicant tracking system. If they have one. If not, the company (recruiters) will work the applications from the Indeed dashboard.\n\n## Comment ID kqw4puw with +1 score by [(AffectionatePilot242, Reddit, 2024-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/kqw4puw/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nWell that explains why I've applied to 10-20 different jobs and got no responses whatsoever.

I have used indeed in the past and gotten work before that turned out pretty well. The problem I have today is not with indeed but the kinds of ridiculous, disproportionately over the top analysation of the individual for like, you know, a part-time house cleaning job I'm not looking to work for the NSA man. Employers really want to get in your head today having you pass all these extra bullshit aptitude tests and what not jumping through all these hoops to       \"stand out in a crowd\". Utter nonsense.\nI'm an OG Gen Xer so looking to supplement an income today, things are very different than what I'm used to with employers. I live in Portland Oregon cost of living is outrageous right now and not looking better \"employers\" today don't want to pay shit. The parameters of the job they want you to do the work of three people but barely want to pay you for one. Again the hiring requirements are so stringent drug tests are fine but in a state where THC is legal and you still test for that You  wonder why you can't hire anybody? Dummies. They call it a job market, it's more like a job convenience store or even better food cart. You spend 2 hours filling out on application only to be ghosted.

Last spring we suddenly got flagged for suspicious activity. I do worry spam is somehow attached to us because I am dealing with some pretty bad hacking issues still. Shortly after they then suspended our account.  I called at least 50 times over a month, speaking to different agents and then upper management. All gave me a possible reason of what might have caused flagging, however they avoid telling me the exact reason, which I thought is very strange. I gave them my business license and other documents proving we are not fake or a scam. They thanked me for being so transparent but still could not release suspension! \n\nI made new appointment and management contacted me about account. I was advised to try changing my pay structure within my ads. Make more realistic and not to oversell and to keep basic info. This is what our agents make though? some actually make more than what I had in our ad... I was then advised to try to add some sort of base pay. I let her know, our managers make salary plus commission however our agent have a very nice performance based structure. It motivates and is successful. She then advised me that upper corp doesn't like to bring on so many \"commission only\" companies. I was kind of shocked! we have always marketed on their platform and never got flagged now every ad is flagged before being posted and now they are telling me to change how I pay people?\n\nThis issue began last spring and I am STILL dealing with is a year later now! It has crippled my company. I dumped a ton of money last summer into other platforms and got nothing its weird! since, I have had to shut down 2 of my offices now because hiring is at literally at a halt its scary. I paid $300 for a subscription and they cant even tell me the exact reason so I can fix?\n\n### Comment ID kwraywk with +1 score by [(darkkaangel, Reddit, 2024-03-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/140z33l/my_jobs_keep_getting_flagged_on_indeedcom_and/kwraywk/) (in reply to ID kwglhtt):\nHello I am in a similar situation, main account job post gets flagged, and no one reply on customer.

I'm having something of a nightmare with indeed.\n\nI tried posting a job, and I immediately got a message saying \"account paused for suspicious activity\".  I know the scammers have taken over like half the internet, so I understand.  I replied to this message attaching my driver's license and Doing Business As certification that I got from the city where I live.  I got a reply back saying \"We do not accept these documents.  Please send us your business license.\"\n\nGod... the business i want to start is a very simple house cleaning thing.  That's all.  But okay, I look up the procedure for getting a business license.  It requires that I go to my city's planning department, pick up some documents, have the landlord of the house where I live fill them out, then bring them back to the planning department, get them certified, then go to town hall and file them in for an official business license.  This whole thing ends up costing a week of ping-ponging around government offices and I've spent nearly 200 dollars to get everything involved (I'm leaving a bunch of stuff out.)\n\nBut finally, I have it!  MY BUSINESS LICENSE!  YAY!  I take a picture and email it straight away to indeed.\n\nI get a reply back -- I kid you not -- \"we cannot accept this as it does not link to your home address\".\n\nMy home address is quite literally in 2 places, in big, bold font, right there on the license.  I'm not sure how a picture of my business license can \"link\" in any other fashion.  When I reply to them saying \"yes it is, it's right there\", they write back saying \"looks like we can't help you, go to our help page, thanks\".  \n\nI wrote back a long and sincere, genuine plea, that I can absolutely prove beyond any doubt that I'm a real person, and offered dozens of options, including making a youtube video of me walking into my own house, showing the address, and showing the desk where I'd be dispatching cleaners to various houses.  I could provide references of other people who could swear under penalty of perjury that I'm really doing what I claim to do.  \n\nThey wrote back the same reply as before, saying \"looks like we can't help you, go to our help page, thanks\".\n\nFrom there, I decided to contact their holdings company which is located in Japan and write them about what's going on.  They replied saying they can't help me, I'd have to contact someone more local.  I then looked up the indeed office in the US, found the emails of the top execs at the Indeed building in Texas, and included them in the email exchange (this was yesterday and today is July 4, a holiday, so no reply yet.)  No contact phone number was never given to me during any of this so I couldn't call anyone.\n\nWhile this was going on, I figured I'd also try signing in with a completely different email, and ask my girlfriend if I could use her credit card to try posting the job again, thus potentially getting around this block.  Different email, different card number, different name, went through the entire process, and..... believe it or not, got the same exact insta-block \"ACCOUNT IS SUSPICIOUS\" stuff from before.  \n\nI think it's time to just give up on indeed.  After all the above happened, by pure chance I found a phone number where I can call them, but like I said it's July 4th.  I'll try calling them tomorrow or next week, but if this doesn't work, then I'll just move on to monster or zip-recruiter and not use indeed anymore.  \n\nOne last thought...\n\nI've noticed when I try searching for a job on indeed, every job is super low quality, or +30 days old (meaning it's basically dead.)  I no longer see the plethora of relevant jobs from a variety of businesses I would have seen just a year ago.  I guess this means everyone else is running into this same brick wall?\n\nThanks for posting the thread.  It's good to know I'm not the only one.\n\n### Comment ID m38a7a3 with +1 score by [(UpstairsOk4264, Reddit, 2024-12-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/140z33l/my_jobs_keep_getting_flagged_on_indeedcom_and/m38a7a3/) (in reply to ID lbnm0za):\nI think they flag the ip address also\n\n#### Comment ID m38abmw with +1 score by [(UpstairsOk4264, Reddit, 2024-12-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/140z33l/my_jobs_keep_getting_flagged_on_indeedcom_and/m38abmw/) (in reply to ID m38a7a3):\nSo you have to log in from different ip, never use ip that was linked to old account, make a new llc, new address and new ip with new card number\n\n## Comment ID lc27nbl with +1 score by [(MushroomRelative6726, Reddit, 2024-07-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/140z33l/my_jobs_keep_getting_flagged_on_indeedcom_and/lc27nbl/) (in reply to ID 140z33l):\nHere is what I do.

Keep in mind Indeed is often the final stop for a job, and like any job board, those roles get cancelled often due to so many factors (like \"oh great, we found someone in-house who can do the job!).  In other words, please don't take every rejection as a rejection.  There are plenty of instances where I rejected 80 resumes because I found my guy and didn't need them anymore.  \n\nI'd go over to /r/resumes and have one of us take a look at your resume to be sure that's not hurting you.  A strong resume, good experience, Indeed.com, and a decent follow-up strategy are virtually fail-proof when looking for a job.  But most people have at least one major hole in their strategy, if not several.\n\nSource: own and operate a resume writing and career services company that does this kind of thing for clients every day\n\n### Comment ID dde9zjl with +8 score by [(Pirateer, Reddit, 2017-02-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5savjx/having_little_success_with_indeedcom_are_there/dde9zjl/) (in reply to ID dddpyic):\nThis. \nI worked for a fortune 500. Even if a manager wanted to promote someone and knew it, per  company practices, union rules, etc, the position to had to be posted internally, externally, and through contractor groups for a giant company circle jerk.  \n\nRounds of interviews. People traveling from all over.  Hourly workers burning vacation to interview.  So many people would waste time and hope before the manager could pull the trigger on something they knew they wanted since day zero.\n\nAnd when the decision wasn't up to a manager, they'd still stack the deck.  Internal workers with disciplinary history, unqualified applicants, and/or fresh out of college kids would be pulled for interviews to make the pre-desired person look more attractive.  One time such an applicant was slipped the questions before hand and prepped written answers to read from... the boss was slapped on the wrist and then filed a company gag order on the employee to make sure they didn't spread the fact that they were promised the job and didn't get it.\n\nThe \"dog and pony show,' as they call it, was one of the most disgusting thing is about working there.\n\nSo if you're not pulling interviews, don't fret. Some companies just don't give a f***. Often enough, applicants spend hours to fill out the stuff on the companies application websites, if the right qualifications or a key word isn't there no human eyes will even see the product of the work put in.\n\n\nIndeed is very much a Standard, but if you can - **try to find Facebook or LinkedIn groups.** Those are good to monitor. If someone is looking for Applicants on those, they're generally more serious about hiring, looking to do it quickly, and just want a resume emailed to them  (not the whole recreate your resume line by line for their online tool). \n\nEdit: fat thumbs, and predictive text aren't my friends.\n\n#### Comment ID ddg72kr with +2 score by [(sadlittleUWstudent, Reddit, 2017-02-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5savjx/having_little_success_with_indeedcom_are_there/ddg72kr/) (in reply to ID dde9zjl):\n^^ This is amazingly true. \n\nAs a new graduate I actually had a suspiciously high amount of interviews - but for some strange reason, most people would pretend that they mis-read my resume in such a way to interpret 5 co-ops as 5 separate jobs each lasting years, even though I listed clearly that my co-ops were only a few months in duration each. \n\nA lot of my interviews would even turn into roasts - and you'd be surprised how much resources companies would (purposely?) waste on doing phantom interviews. If the company is small and has a hand-written sign-in/sign-out sheet, I'd see one person get interviewed for a full hour, then a bunch of names afterwards, including myself, getting interviewed for only ten minutes. \n\nDamn shameful.

I've also worked with recruiters and had a great experience there. It might be worth reaching out to a recuiter in your area (if you're in New England I can recommend a couple). The nice thing with recruiters is they're (often) compensated based on your salary so it's in their interest to get you as highly paid as possible.\n\n### Comment ID hie1ljm with +2 score by [(Caution-HotStuffHere, Reddit, 2021-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/qhjpq0/other_than_indeed_are_there_any_other_career/hie1ljm/) (in reply to ID hidjxcj):\nIn my experience, that works both ways. Recruiters benefit by getting the contract as high as possible. But when it comes time to negotiate your salary if/when you covert to FTE, be leery of anything they tell you. Companies love a recruiter that can get them cheap employees when they convert to FTE.\n\nThe way I play it is to ask their opinion like \"since you've placed multiple FTEs at ACME, what are your recommendations on what salary I should seek?\" Then I ignore them and negotiate on my own, even if they try to stick their nose in it. But I always ask them first because I want to make sure I'm not coming in too low.\n\nThe generic advice for converting from contract to FTE is you'll make a little less. For example, a contract of $80K will convert to FTE of $70-75 because you're also getting benefits, paid PTO, etc. I've always found that to be bullshit, even before the current hot job market. \n\nI look at it the opposite way. If I'm making $80K on contract, the company is probably paying the staffing company at least $140K. Even after you add in great benefits, requesting a higher FTE salary like $90K will still bring me in well under $140K.\n\n#### Comment ID hih3c4z with +1 score by [(NickBurns00, Reddit, 2021-10-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/qhjpq0/other_than_indeed_are_there_any_other_career/hih3c4z/) (in reply to ID hie1ljm):\nYou can use recruiters and get a FT job right away without contract work.\n\n## Comment ID hidwhbo with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/qhjpq0/other_than_indeed_are_there_any_other_career/hidwhbo/) (in reply to ID qhjpq0):\nI found this link the other day in an antiwork thread.

Hoping this can help out a bit!\n\nFor me, I 100% prefer LinkedIn IF AND ONLY IF your profile is updated based on your employment, education, and skills. LinkedIn recommends me jobs based on the skills on my profile and past experience (I work in a hotel and graduated with a finance degree from college last May) - so I get jobs recommended to me like financial analyst positions or front office manager positions.\n\nI have used Indeed before and got an interview off it, but never used it much since I landed my last job. Indeed has gotten better over the years but I very seldom use it. Every time I import my resume to create my profile it would mess up the format to the point where I wouldn't trust sending any apps out on their site. Indeed is easier for convenience but may not give the recruiter an idea of who you are (unlike LinkedIn).\n\nIn terms of scams, they are kinda all over the place regardless of where you go. Just watch out for red flags (getting an immediate offer with no interview, salary too good to be true, etc...)\n\nAlso, with LinkedIn you may be able to get in contact with the job poster (recruiter). This makes it easier to follow up or inquire about any openings on the company that may not be directly advertised. Indeed is more anonymous and you're kinda waiting more in the dark.\n\nBest way to get a job? Networking. Connect with classmates, graduates, family members, and reach out to them. I am working with my uncle to see if I can land an insurance job in the summer. Don't be afraid to reach out, you never know what may happen!\n\n## Comment ID jss8ll2 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/10ufp5w/linkedin_vs_indeed/jss8ll2/) (in reply to ID 10ufp5w):\nIndeed is like a black hole for me.

Search doesn't work, when you try to say \"not interested\" or \"don't show again,\" the listings still show up. Most jobs are either 30+ days old (already filled) or have hundreds of applicants. You get nowhere with either of them. And then there's the recruiter spam that infiltrates both boards. Over 70% estimate of both boards are recruiters and staffing agencies, resume collectors, and even identity thieves. You'd practically do better on craigslist than both of these garbage boards.",

Assessments are supposed to be on the bottom of the Indeed Profile (resume) page, but they were not there.\n\nHere's the fix - If the resume on your profile is a PDF doc (or other uploaded resume), convert it to an Indeed resume. Once you do this, the assessments section will appear on the bottom of your profile page. Don't worry, it won't change any resumes that you previously submitted.\n\nOnce the assessments sections appears, it will show your scores (highly proficient, expert, etc.) You can also click on the link next to the scores to see a more detailed analysis (but not which questions you got right or wrong).\n\nAfter you do this, you can delete your Indeed formatted resume and upload your preferred resume again.\n\n### Comment ID if2dw8o with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-07-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qhfh03/cant_find_indeed_assessment_results_anymore/if2dw8o/) (in reply to ID hiwy9za):\nPinging this comment because I am having the same issue.

I used just physician assistant rather than that + speciality I wanted and I made the radius as wide as possible, looked up other random cities in the state I wanted, and searched again using those cities with the widest range. I also searched advanced practice provider and NP. I applied for a ton of NP jobs and got multiple interviews with people who made a listing for an NP. \n\nI’d also recommend reaching out to your PA program if it’s located somewhere you’d be willing to work.

      "# Post ID 8s34e4: Special relationship between Indeed.com and Unemployment Office? with +2 score by [(watdonowplz, Reddit, 2018-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/8s34e4/special_relationship_between_indeedcom_and/)\nMy manager has told me on several occasions that the unemployment office has partnered with Indeed.com to track the job search/interviewing habits of unemployment beneficiaries.  This seems odd to me and I am highly skeptical. I have done some research but have found nothing to support his statement.  \n\nI am sure beneficiaries can submit proof of job search activity via what their Indeed applications yield (e.g. automated \"Thank you for applying\" or \"You application has successfully been submitted\" etc...).  However, my manager is adamant that Indeed has a special relationship with the Unemployment Office to keep track of application activities.  This all stems from the fact that I use Indeed to recruit heavily. I find it's quick, cheap, and effective.  A lot of candidates are not ideal but when you're recruiting for a $12-$13 per hour contact center position we're really just looking for a pleasant personality and a stable job history. We have a very high interview no-show rate, and my manager chalks this up to Indeed being a crappy way to recruit because most people are only applying via Indeed because they'll continue their unemployment benefits that way. \n\nSo, Reddit, has anyone ever heard of this kind of Indeed/Unemployment partnership? If you can't tell already, I think my manager is a little off on this subject but if I've been living under a big ol' stupid rock the last 2 years of my HR career I would like to know. \n\nThank you for your time! \n\n## Comment ID e0w81nr with +2 score by [(OkayAshley, Reddit, 2018-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/8s34e4/special_relationship_between_indeedcom_and/e0w81nr/) (in reply to ID 8s34e4):\nI would call your local unemployment office and ask them, all of the offices I’ve dealt with are super friendly!

      "# Post ID 8yaffi: Major Indeed.com Filter Flaw [Affects Employers and Job Seekers] with +295 score by [(SDo-000, Reddit, 2018-07-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yaffi/major_indeedcom_filter_flaw_affects_employers_and/)\nI posted a job on [indeed.com](https://indeed.com) as I have done before.  I had a total of 55 applications for my position.  One of my questions before a candidate could submit their resume was \"How many years of experience do you have?\".  \n\nSince indeed sends you resumes as attachments, I checked out a few candidate resumes in my email.  Later in the morning I logged in and used a filter to isolate the people with 7 or more years of experience.  I noticed that the 3 candidates that caught my eye in my email did not show up on the list.  I thought it was something I was doing wrong so I reset the filter and tried again, this time only selecting one filter option \"10+\".  Still those candidates which had answered the question with 12 & 13 years did not come up.  \n\nI started to realize the problem wasn't me.  I reset it again but this time I selected all the filter options \\[from 0 years experience to 10+\\].  Since I selected all the options I should have a list with all 55 candidates.  However, I had a list of 37 candidates -- literally, 18 people just didn't exist once I used the filter.\n\nI called indeed support and spoke with a rep.  She logged into my account and replicated what I did with the same results.  She apologized and claimed that this was a beta feature and only 10&#37; of employers have access to this feature.  Filtering is in beta?  WTF?  Firstly, I'm not buying that something as standard as a \"years of experience\" filter is only now being introduced to indeed and secondly, why is it not labeled as such so employers know not to use it or to expect undesirable behavior.\n\nI'm just writing this post to make employers and job seekers alike aware.  If you're an employer, you might be missing some valuable people if you're using an indeed filter.  If you're a job seeker, you may not even be seen by the employers.\n\n## Comment ID e29giqz with +100 score by [(midniteslayr, Reddit, 2018-07-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yaffi/major_indeedcom_filter_flaw_affects_employers_and/e29giqz/) (in reply to ID 8yaffi):\nTheir commercials on TV advertise their filtering options.

If this is the reason why my responses have been so few (even more so than before, maybe?), it's time to find a new job hunting site.\n\nIt sucks because Indeed has most of the listings around me and it isn't as easy as finding the open position on a company site after referencing Indeed. Most companies here are local and don't even have their own site or don't have the position listed to apply for. :/\n\n## Comment ID e5extl4 with +1 score by [(SheWhoCreates, Reddit, 2018-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yaffi/major_indeedcom_filter_flaw_affects_employers_and/e5extl4/) (in reply to ID 8yaffi):\nThat's terrible ;( I have sent my resume a couple years back and I got a notice saying the company did view my resume, which made me happy to know the site works and that, I might get a call back, but no, I didn't. I've applied to other jobs last month and the other night and haven't gotten the \"Application viewed\", just a notice saying the jobs I applied too, are expired, which was such a piss off! ;(( I don't know, I hope my application gets to be viewed this month, or else, I'm just wasting my time :(\n\n### Comment ID e5faft9 with +1 score by [(SDo-000, Reddit, 2018-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yaffi/major_indeedcom_filter_flaw_affects_employers_and/e5faft9/) (in reply to ID e5extl4):\nSo unfortunately for applicants, there are several ways an employer can see your resume and only one of these will trigger an alert to the candidate. When you apply for a job, the employer receives an email with your name and resume as an attachment. If they view your resume through that attachment, you’ll never know. The other way is if the employer views your resume through their dashboard. The dash gives them your cover letter and resume but usually in a plain view without formatting. If they view it this way, you will never know. The last method is if they go into the dashboard and click “download resume”. This download resume option gives them your resume in the original format you sent it in (ie: word/pdf) and this is the only method that triggers an alert to the applicant.  However, this is the same file that is emailed to them when you first apply, so if they viewed that one, there might be no reason for them to ever click the download option. \n\nSo just because you didn’t get an alert doesn’t mean they didn’t see it. However, it also doesn’t mean they did see it.\n\n#### Comment ID e5fepoi with +1 score by [(SheWhoCreates, Reddit, 2018-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yaffi/major_indeedcom_filter_flaw_affects_employers_and/e5fepoi/) (in reply to ID e5faft9):\nGotcha, thank you for explaining! What do you think I should do? How can I get my resume on their dashboard? Do you think I should write a cover letter for each job I apply to, even if they don't ask for one? Or simply just write an interest for the job position instead of a cover letter, if not asked for one? I really want to get seen :/\n\n## Comment ID e5fjc76 with +1 score by [(SDo-000, Reddit, 2018-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yaffi/major_indeedcom_filter_flaw_affects_employers_and/e5fjc76/) (in reply to ID 8yaffi):\nAll submissions go to the dashboard. A cover letter is always a good idea. Depending on the job and location an employer could get a hundred or more responses to a job but less than half submit a cover letter.  There’s a chance an employer will stop looking through resumes once they find 5-7 qualified candidates.  If you have a cover letter, there’s a better chance you get looked at since the cover letter should highlight your qualifications. This in turn may get the employer interested enough to open your resume.\n\n## Comment ID lra6kdx with +1 score by [(jallisy, Reddit, 2024-10-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yaffi/major_indeedcom_filter_flaw_affects_employers_and/lra6kdx/) (in reply to ID 8yaffi):\nIndeed.com - I had a similar experience, but from a job seeker perspective.  If I use the <experience> filter, the results contain both postings that are way outside the filter I selected and also postings completely irrelevant to my key words (i.e., using key words \"legal support\"  (no quotes) produced listings for x-ray technicians, restaurant staff, etc).\n\nUnfortunate.\n\n## Comment ID e29oz1o with +1 score by [(Smarterthanlastweek, Reddit, 2018-07-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yaffi/major_indeedcom_filter_flaw_affects_employers_and/e29oz1o/) (in reply to ID 8yaffi):\nThanks for the heads up!\n\n## Comment ID k2djtd0 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yaffi/major_indeedcom_filter_flaw_affects_employers_and/k2djtd0/) (in reply to ID 8yaffi):\nYEah indeed fucking sucks.

This department “SBS” makes up almost a third of revenue in the company yet gets treated like the work dogs. Directors have discretion on interpreting policy which makes it hard to know what’s actually ok and what is not. Varies from team to team. Directors literally do nothing but say you’re not doing enough, even to people who are at the top of the sales board. Directors are incompetent in how to actually do the job and basically baby sit. The target generating system is broken, people are making record breaking amounts of sales and are still not getting close to targets. Room for growth is almost non existent now. Directors will try to stop you from leaving to try and benefit themselves. Work life balance is awful when there is a broken target system causing stress and uncertainty for each new quarter.",

Everyone I know that's left is miserable and most are trying to get out. \n\nPros:\n-Free lunch buffet with pretty good food\n-Baristas in offices that make free custom coffees, smoothies, and juices\n-Fully stocked snack pantries and drink fridges on every floor\n-Generous flexible PTO policy (depending on your team)\n-Better-than-average awareness of social issues and encouragement to learn and honor others\n-Several of my managers were incredible and I would follow them anywhere. Top tier people.\n-Many of my colleagues were genuinely some of the best people I've ever met and really care about helping people get jobs.\n-Generous bonuses if you performed well",

If your experience is like mine, expect your DM to make you do their job: resource planning, meeting organization, it's all ad hoc and delegated. DMs are glorified performance reviewers, and it's pretty clear they're being directed to squeeze performance reviews to find excuses to fire or hold back good engineers to avoid more layoffs, like all the big tech companies.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech stack is a mess. It's honestly baffling in 2024...it's something I would have considered obsolete in 2014. There's no time for tech debt, though, because management is so bad at managing projects that everyone is just working on experimental projects that are desperately guessing at ways to improve UX, the vast majority of which fail, wasting months of work. That makes sense for Google, who basically admitted 10 years ago that they'd peaked. Every app does eventually. But you shouldn't hire for growth if you aren't growing.",

Siloes are created and some managers use that as a tactic to divide team members and support some more than others or not at all. Career growth is associated with who your manager is and whether they really want to support you or not. Some middle managers have too much control over employee advancement and directors look the other way or aren’t present at all. At first Indeed valued culture and diversity but that has also been tainted by individuals in middle management. My former team is now all white women, mostly of a certain age with similar backgrounds and lifestyles. Only one man remains and one person of color who’s a contractor.",

DMs are glorified performance reviewers, and it's pretty clear they're being directed to squeeze performance reviews to find excuses to fire or hold back good engineers to avoid more layoffs, like all the big tech companies.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech stack is a mess. It's honestly baffling in 2024...it's something I would have considered obsolete in 2014. There's no time for tech debt, though, because management is so bad at managing projects that everyone is just working on experimental projects that are desperately guessing at ways to improve UX, the vast majority of which fail, wasting months of work.

Siloes are created and some managers use that as a tactic to divide team members and support some more than others or not at all. Career growth is associated with who your manager is and whether they really want to support you or not. Some middle managers have too much control over employee advancement and directors look the other way or aren’t present at all.

      "# [Indeed to lay off 1,000 employees on 2024-05-14](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/)\nThe job website Indeed, which has headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut and Austin, Texas, is laying off around 1,000 people, which is around 8 percent of the company.\n\nNo information has been released on how many jobs in Connecticut will be affected.\n\n“I am sad to share the news that we have made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount through a layoff. Unlike last year, where our reduction was driven by cost savings, we are taking this action because we need to simplify our organization to make it easier and faster for us to make decisions, and help us to more effectively grow revenue and hires,” Indeed CEO Chris Hyams said in a statement that was shared with employees.\n\nIndeed said that the company maintains a co-headquarters in Stamford and there are no changes to the real estate footprint as a result of the announcement.\n\n“Indeed remains committed to Connecticut. The state continues to be very business friendly, with strong support for our workforce and users - job seekers and employers. Additionally, Stamford is still a key sales office for Indeed, and integral to Indeed’s long-term plans,” Indeed said in a statement.\n\n“While the reductions touch many groups and regions, they are not across the board like last year; rather they are mostly concentrated in the US, and are more focused on R&D and some Go-to-Market teams. We worked closely with the HR, Legal, and DEIB+ teams to ensure objectivity and equity in the decision-making process. The final selections have had no measurably disproportionate impact on women and under-represented genders or the under-represented minority population in the US,” Hyams told employees.\n\nIn 2017, Indeed executives and then-Gov. Dannel Malloy announced that the company was expanding its Stamford offices and bringing in hundreds of employees to have a total of more than 1,200 employees in Connecticut.\n\nLocal\n\nIn June 2020, as the state was reopening after the pandemic business closings, Indeed partnered with the state on a custom jobs portal for jobseekers and employers looking for opportunities to get back to reopen and get back to work.\n\nFollowing is the full statement from the CEO:\n\nA Message from our CEO, Chris Hyams\n\n\"I am sad to share the news that we have made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount through a layoff. Unlike last year, where our reduction was driven by cost savings, we are taking this action because we need to simplify our organization to make it easier and faster for us to make decisions, and help us to more effectively grow revenue and hires.\n\n\"We anticipate that we will be letting approximately 1,000 people go, representing ~8% of the company. While the reductions touch many groups and regions, they are not across the board like last year; rather they are mostly concentrated in the US, and are more focused on R&D and some Go-to-Market teams. We worked closely with the HR, Legal, and DEIB+ teams to ensure objectivity and equity in the decision-making process. The final selections have had no measurably disproportionate impact on women and under-represented genders or the under-represented minority population in the US.\n\n\"Within the hour, employees outside of Ireland, the UK, and Australia will hear whether or not you have been impacted by this decision. If you are impacted, your email will include a link to the details of your separation package, which will vary by region. Package amounts have been increased for most employees over last year, and include severance, healthcare payment where applicable, and outplacement services, among others. Employees in Ireland, the UK, and Australia will hear within the hour whether you will be entering into the consultation process.\n\n\"I am responsible for how we got here, and the entire SLT is responsible for making the difficult decisions necessary to help set us up for the future. We know these decisions will have a significant impact on people’s lives. I’d like to share some context for why I believe it’s necessary.\n\n\"Last year we were facing a global slowdown in hiring, which led to multiple consecutive quarters of revenue loss. We reduced our headcount, instituted multiple cost-saving measures, and instilled investment discipline across the company. These measures worked, and we are now operating with stable profitability.\n\n\"However, while the global economy has improved in several areas over the past year, we are not yet set up for sustainable growth. Despite our efforts so far, our organization is still too complex, we still have significant duplication of effort and too many organizational layers that slow down decision-making. We have been working to simplify every aspect of our business, but without meaningful change, we can’t get where we need to go.\n\n\"At a high level, we are significantly restructuring the R&D team to align with our marketplace strategy, and we are reducing layers of management. We are also restructuring and aligning some Go-to-Market teams, and will be eliminating most of the Sales and CS roles in Foster City, California. Across the business we are making additional changes to simplify decision-making and create clarity.\n\n\"For those who are staying, I know you will need time to absorb this news. Tomorrow we will have a global town hall where I will share more about the overall org structure. This will be followed by org-specific town halls led by SLT, with opportunities to get answers to your questions. On Wednesday, we will share the updated organization chart for everyone to see.\n\n\"As difficult as these changes are, our new structure will help us to simplify and work more effectively as one team, reignite growth in revenue, and drive toward our 2030 goal to help 100 million people get jobs.\n\n\"But today, our focus will be on those who are leaving.\n\n\"Our mission is vital. Helping people get jobs is a profound privilege. Our work is driven by the deep understanding of just how important a job is in a person’s life. We all know what it means to lose that. For those of you who are leaving, this is incredibly hard. We are committed to bringing as much support to you as possible in the days and weeks ahead. You helped millions of people get jobs, and helped Indeed to be a better place. Thank you.\"",
      "# [Indeed lays off 1K employees, citing ‘global slow-down’ in hiring by Kathryn Moody on 2024-05-15](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/)\nThis audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.\n\nIndeed laid off approximately 1,000 employees Monday, or about 8% of the company, Indeed CEO Chris Hyams announced May 13 in a letter to employees, a move driven in part by “a global slow-down in hiring,” the message said.\n\nThe vast majority of the layoffs were in the U.S., Hyams said, largely within R&D and the go-to-market teams.\n\n“While the global economy has improved in several areas over the past year, we are not yet set up for sustainable growth,” Hyams said. “Despite our efforts so far, our organization is still too complex,” he continued, indicating that the company is aiming to “simplify” areas of the business to make decision-making faster.\n\nIndeed laid off about 15% of its workforce in March of last year, or around 2,200 people, in response to tanking job postings. Hyams also took a reduction in base pay at that time.\n\nThose measures worked, he said, and Indeed is operating with stable profitability but now needs to “reignite growth.” Notably, the company flubbed the roll-out of one of its more experimental payment schemes since the start of the pandemic, stakeholders said previously told HR Dive. Pay per application, which would have allowed employers only to pay for accepted applications from approved candidates, ran into a number of roadblocks with clients when it was first rolled out in 2022. For example, many small businesses did not have the capacity to handle approval of applications before they would be billed in the thousands, one expert said at the time.",

    "# Indeed Company and Product Report\n\n## Company Overview\n\nIndeed is a prominent job search website headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and Austin, Texas. The platform connects job seekers with employers, facilitating the hiring process across various industries. As of May 2024, Indeed is undergoing significant organizational changes, including a substantial layoff of approximately 1,000 employees, which represents about 8% of its workforce [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/). This decision comes after a previous layoff of around 2,200 employees in March 2023, which accounted for 15% of the company, indicating a trend of workforce reduction in response to market conditions [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/).\n\n## Recent Layoffs and Organizational Changes\n\nThe recent layoffs are primarily concentrated in the United States, particularly within the Research & Development (R&D) and Go-to-Market teams. CEO Chris Hyams stated that the layoffs are part of a strategy to simplify the organization and improve decision-making processes, which he described as currently \"too complex\" [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/). Hyams emphasized the need for the company to \"reignite growth\" and align its structure with its marketplace strategy, aiming for sustainable growth in the future [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/).\n\n## Financial Performance and Market Position\n\nDespite the layoffs, Indeed has reported stable profitability following previous cost-saving measures. Hyams noted that while the global economy has shown signs of improvement, the company is still not positioned for sustainable growth, necessitating these organizational changes [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/). The company aims to streamline operations to better serve its mission of helping 100 million people find jobs by 2030 [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/).\n\n## Product Developments and Challenges\n\nIndeed's product offerings include a range of tools for job seekers and employers, but the company has faced challenges with some of its experimental payment schemes. For instance, the \"pay per application\" model, which was intended to allow employers to pay only for accepted applications, encountered difficulties during its rollout in 2022. Many small businesses struggled with the billing process, leading to complications that hindered its adoption [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/).\n\n## Commitment to Community and Workforce\n\nDespite the layoffs, Indeed has reiterated its commitment to its Connecticut headquarters and the local workforce. The company has stated that it remains dedicated to supporting job seekers and employers in the region, highlighting its role in the local economy [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/). The company previously partnered with the state of Connecticut in June 2020 to create a custom jobs portal aimed at helping job seekers and employers during the pandemic [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/).\n\n## Executive Insights\n\nIn his communication regarding the layoffs, CEO Chris Hyams expressed the emotional weight of the decision, stating, \"I am sad to share the news that we have made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount through a layoff\" [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/). He acknowledged the impact of these changes on employees' lives and emphasized the company's mission to help people find jobs, which he described as a \"profound privilege\" [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIndeed is currently navigating a challenging landscape marked by workforce reductions and the need for organizational simplification. While the company has achieved stable profitability, it faces ongoing challenges in aligning its product offerings with market demands. Prospective candidates and investors should consider these factors when evaluating Indeed's future potential and stability in the job search market."
