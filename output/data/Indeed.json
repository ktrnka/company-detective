  "summary_markdown": "# About Indeed\n\nIndeed is a prominent job search platform with headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, and Austin, Texas. The company was founded in 2004 and has grown to become a significant player in the employment sector, offering services to both job seekers and employers. Indeed operates on a B2C and B2B model, providing a platform for job seekers to find employment opportunities and for employers to post job listings and manage recruitment processes.\n\nAs of May 2024, Indeed employed approximately 12,500 people, following a layoff of about 1,000 employees, which represented 8% of its workforce [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/). The layoffs were part of a strategic move to simplify the organization and improve decision-making processes.\n\nIndeed generates revenue primarily through job posting fees and premium services offered to employers. The company has introduced various product features, such as \"Pay per Application,\" which allows employers to pay only for accepted applications, although this model has faced challenges, particularly with small businesses [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/).\n\nThe platform is widely used, with a significant number of job seekers and employers relying on its services. Indeed's products are distributed online, making them accessible to a global audience. Over time, the company has faced both internal and external challenges, including financial restructuring and criticism over certain business practices [(Y Combinator News, 2024-09-04)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40539575).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nChris Hyams is the CEO of Indeed. He has been vocal about the company's recent layoffs and the strategic reasons behind them. Hyams has emphasized the need for organizational simplification to enhance decision-making and support revenue growth [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/). His leadership is crucial as Indeed navigates its current challenges and seeks sustainable growth.\n\n# News\n\n## Recent Layoffs\n\nIn May 2024, Indeed announced the layoff of approximately 1,000 employees, primarily in the U.S., affecting teams in Research & Development and Go-to-Market functions. This decision followed a previous round of layoffs in 2023, where 2,200 employees were let go due to a slowdown in hiring and revenue loss [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/). CEO Chris Hyams stated that these measures were necessary to streamline operations and position the company for future growth [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/).\n\n## Product Developments\n\nIndeed has faced challenges with its \"Pay per Application\" model, which has been problematic for small businesses struggling with the application approval process. This issue has raised concerns about the company's ability to innovate effectively in a competitive market [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/).\n\n## Market Position and User Sentiment\n\nDespite the layoffs, Indeed remains a widely used platform. However, there have been mixed sentiments regarding the company's practices. Concerns have been raised about the potential sale of user information to recruiters, leading to unsolicited contact from recruiting firms [(Y Combinator News, 2024-09-04)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40539575). Additionally, Indeed faced backlash for a controversial job ad deemed discriminatory, prompting the company to reaffirm its commitment to inclusivity [(First Coast News, 2024-02-27)](https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/verify/racist-jobs-ad-stating-no-african-americans-needed-was-posted-on-indeed/77-ec9635d3-f236-41ee-abe0-ad3f23defb72).\n\n# Additional Reading\n\n- [Indeed for Employers UK - Sign in](https://uk.indeed.com/employers/login)\n- [NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/)\n- [HR Dive, 2024-05-15](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/)\n- [Y Combinator News, 2024-09-04](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40539575)\n- [First Coast News, 2024-02-27](https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/verify/racist-jobs-ad-stating-no-african-americans-needed-was-posted-on-indeed/77-ec9635d3-f236-41ee-abe0-ad3f23defb72)\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive overview of Indeed's current state, including its organizational changes, product challenges, and market position.

In addition, you can indicate you are not interested in a job 🚫 and select the reason, but similar jobs keep popping up. Why can't you completely exclude a field??? \n3. It would be good if a job were automatically moved to \"applied\" once you complete the application. I have come close to applying for the same job twice.\nAnd finally a suggestion - it would be super helpful if listings fposted the location of the actual job - just the zip code would be extremely helpful! In some cases a position is posted through a recruiter and I'm not sure if the location is the recruoting office or the workplace. In others the nearest major city is listed but it is not where the person will be working - I've applied to some great sounding positions, only to find out the office location is not in my search radius.

It often feels like companies post job openings just to make it look like they're hiring. I've applied to over 100 jobs, and barely any of them have even bothered to respond. The few that did just sent generic rejections, saying they were moving forward with other candidates.\n\nThe whole application process needs a serious overhaul. If jobs really need to be filled, why aren’t these companies hiring when people like me are applying? Job listings are often misleading, and many positions stay posted long after they've been filled. It’s disheartening to put in so much effort only to face automated rejections with no feedback on how to improve.\n\nIndeed needs to push for more transparency and clearer communication from employers. It would also help if they ensured that job postings are up-to-date and accurate. The current system just isn’t working for job seekers, and it’s incredibly disheartening.",

I have no medical background or IT, but get listings for nurses, dentists, IT professionals, etc. There is an option to \"Hide jobs with these details\" but it does not work: I selected hiding \"Spanish\" but jobs requiring the language still appear. Being able to add your own items to the exclude list would be helpful as well. \n2. In addition, you can indicate you are not interested in a job 🚫 and select the reason, but similar jobs keep popping up. Why can't you completely exclude a field??? \n3. It would be good if a job were automatically moved to \"applied\" once you complete the application. I have come close to applying for the same job twice.\nAnd finally a suggestion - it would be super helpful if listings fposted the location of the actual job - just the zip code would be extremely helpful! In some cases a position is posted through a recruiter and I'm not sure if the location is the recruoting office or the workplace. In others the nearest major city is listed but it is not where the person will be working - I've applied to some great sounding positions, only to find out the office location is not in my search radius.

Last spring we suddenly got flagged for suspicious activity. I do worry spam is somehow attached to us because I am dealing with some pretty bad hacking issues still. Shortly after they then suspended our account.  I called at least 50 times over a month, speaking to different agents and then upper management. All gave me a possible reason of what might have caused flagging, however they avoid telling me the exact reason, which I thought is very strange. I gave them my business license and other documents proving we are not fake or a scam. They thanked me for being so transparent but still could not release suspension! \n\nI made new appointment and management contacted me about account. I was advised to try changing my pay structure within my ads. Make more realistic and not to oversell and to keep basic info. This is what our agents make though? some actually make more than what I had in our ad... I was then advised to try to add some sort of base pay. I let her know, our managers make salary plus commission however our agent have a very nice performance based structure. It motivates and is successful. She then advised me that upper corp doesn't like to bring on so many \"commission only\" companies. I was kind of shocked! we have always marketed on their platform and never got flagged now every ad is flagged before being posted and now they are telling me to change how I pay people?\n\nThis issue began last spring and I am STILL dealing with is a year later now! It has crippled my company. I dumped a ton of money last summer into other platforms and got nothing its weird! since, I have had to shut down 2 of my offices now because hiring is at literally at a halt its scary.

I'm having something of a nightmare with indeed.\n\nI tried posting a job, and I immediately got a message saying \"account paused for suspicious activity\".  I know the scammers have taken over like half the internet, so I understand.  I replied to this message attaching my driver's license and Doing Business As certification that I got from the city where I live.  I got a reply back saying \"We do not accept these documents.  Please send us your business license.\"\n\nGod... the business i want to start is a very simple house cleaning thing.  That's all.  But okay, I look up the procedure for getting a business license.  It requires that I go to my city's planning department, pick up some documents, have the landlord of the house where I live fill them out, then bring them back to the planning department, get them certified, then go to town hall and file them in for an official business license.  This whole thing ends up costing a week of ping-ponging around government offices and I've spent nearly 200 dollars to get everything involved (I'm leaving a bunch of stuff out.)\n\nBut finally, I have it!  MY BUSINESS LICENSE!  YAY!  I take a picture and email it straight away to indeed.\n\nI get a reply back -- I kid you not -- \"we cannot accept this as it does not link to your home address\".\n\nMy home address is quite literally in 2 places, in big, bold font, right there on the license.  I'm not sure how a picture of my business license can \"link\" in any other fashion.  When I reply to them saying \"yes it is, it's right there\", they write back saying \"looks like we can't help you, go to our help page, thanks\".  \n\nI wrote back a long and sincere, genuine plea, that I can absolutely prove beyond any doubt that I'm a real person, and offered dozens of options, including making a youtube video of me walking into my own house, showing the address, and showing the desk where I'd be dispatching cleaners to various houses.  I could provide references of other people who could swear under penalty of perjury that I'm really doing what I claim to do.  \n\nThey wrote back the same reply as before, saying \"looks like we can't help you, go to our help page, thanks\".\n\nFrom there, I decided to contact their holdings company which is located in Japan and write them about what's going on.  They replied saying they can't help me, I'd have to contact someone more local.  I then looked up the indeed office in the US, found the emails of the top execs at the Indeed building in Texas, and included them in the email exchange (this was yesterday and today is July 4, a holiday, so no reply yet.)  No contact phone number was never given to me during any of this so I couldn't call anyone.\n\nWhile this was going on, I figured I'd also try signing in with a completely different email, and ask my girlfriend if I could use her credit card to try posting the job again, thus potentially getting around this block.  Different email, different card number, different name, went through the entire process, and..... believe it or not, got the same exact insta-block \"ACCOUNT IS SUSPICIOUS\" stuff from before.  \n\nI think it's time to just give up on indeed.  After all the above happened, by pure chance I found a phone number where I can call them, but like I said it's July 4th.  I'll try calling them tomorrow or next week, but if this doesn't work, then I'll just move on to monster or zip-recruiter and not use indeed anymore.  \n\nOne last thought...\n\nI've noticed when I try searching for a job on indeed, every job is super low quality, or +30 days old (meaning it's basically dead.)  I no longer see the plethora of relevant jobs from a variety of businesses I would have seen just a year ago.  I guess this means everyone else is running into this same brick wall?\n\nThanks for posting the thread.  It's good to know I'm not the only one.\n\n## Comment ID lc27nbl with +1 score by [(MushroomRelative6726, Reddit, 2024-07-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/140z33l/my_jobs_keep_getting_flagged_on_indeedcom_and/lc27nbl/) (in reply to ID 140z33l):\nHere is what I do.

Keep in mind Indeed is often the final stop for a job, and like any job board, those roles get cancelled often due to so many factors (like \"oh great, we found someone in-house who can do the job!).  In other words, please don't take every rejection as a rejection.  There are plenty of instances where I rejected 80 resumes because I found my guy and didn't need them anymore.  \n\nI'd go over to /r/resumes and have one of us take a look at your resume to be sure that's not hurting you.  A strong resume, good experience, Indeed.com, and a decent follow-up strategy are virtually fail-proof when looking for a job.  But most people have at least one major hole in their strategy, if not several.\n\nSource: own and operate a resume writing and career services company that does this kind of thing for clients every day\n\n### Comment ID dde9zjl with +8 score by [(Pirateer, Reddit, 2017-02-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5savjx/having_little_success_with_indeedcom_are_there/dde9zjl/) (in reply to ID dddpyic):\nThis. \nI worked for a fortune 500. Even if a manager wanted to promote someone and knew it, per  company practices, union rules, etc, the position to had to be posted internally, externally, and through contractor groups for a giant company circle jerk.  \n\nRounds of interviews. People traveling from all over.  Hourly workers burning vacation to interview.  So many people would waste time and hope before the manager could pull the trigger on something they knew they wanted since day zero.\n\nAnd when the decision wasn't up to a manager, they'd still stack the deck.  Internal workers with disciplinary history, unqualified applicants, and/or fresh out of college kids would be pulled for interviews to make the pre-desired person look more attractive.  One time such an applicant was slipped the questions before hand and prepped written answers to read from... the boss was slapped on the wrist and then filed a company gag order on the employee to make sure they didn't spread the fact that they were promised the job and didn't get it.\n\nThe \"dog and pony show,' as they call it, was one of the most disgusting thing is about working there.\n\nSo if you're not pulling interviews, don't fret. Some companies just don't give a f***. Often enough, applicants spend hours to fill out the stuff on the companies application websites, if the right qualifications or a key word isn't there no human eyes will even see the product of the work put in.\n\n\nIndeed is very much a Standard, but if you can - **try to find Facebook or LinkedIn groups.** Those are good to monitor. If someone is looking for Applicants on those, they're generally more serious about hiring, looking to do it quickly, and just want a resume emailed to them  (not the whole recreate your resume line by line for their online tool). \n\nEdit: fat thumbs, and predictive text aren't my friends.\n\n#### Comment ID ddg72kr with +2 score by [(sadlittleUWstudent, Reddit, 2017-02-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5savjx/having_little_success_with_indeedcom_are_there/ddg72kr/) (in reply to ID dde9zjl):\n^^ This is amazingly true. \n\nAs a new graduate I actually had a suspiciously high amount of interviews - but for some strange reason, most people would pretend that they mis-read my resume in such a way to interpret 5 co-ops as 5 separate jobs each lasting years, even though I listed clearly that my co-ops were only a few months in duration each. \n\nA lot of my interviews would even turn into roasts - and you'd be surprised how much resources companies would (purposely?) waste on doing phantom interviews. If the company is small and has a hand-written sign-in/sign-out sheet, I'd see one person get interviewed for a full hour, then a bunch of names afterwards, including myself, getting interviewed for only ten minutes. \n\nDamn shameful.

They are a fake-it-until-they-made-it success story of sharing near false information to draw the crowd and then charge companies for legitimate direct postings and charge recruiters for access to applicant resumes and information.\n\nYes, you can still find some legitimate postings on here for success. Consider closer looks at sponsored positions. Companies pay for these specific listings to show at the top of your search, so there is more likely someone on the other end going through those applications. \n\nFor non-sponsored jobs, read through the description to see if it gives explicit instructions about applying through Indeed. The quick apply button doesn't count. \n\nDon't apply to anything more than two weeks old. If the posting is being monitored, it may be nearly filled, overrun with applications, or focus has moved from checking this posting to another (we are human after all). Old and filled postings are nearly impossible to take down, so most are just left to time out through the site. This takes around six weeks.\n\nUse indeed as a resource to find job postings, but then go directly to a company's website to search for the job and apply directly with them. You'll get much more information about the company and the role (if it is still vacant), and increase your odds that an actual person sees your resume. \n\nSpeaking of resumes, do NOT use Indeed's resumes to apply to anything. Ever. They are terrible. Sure, they are better than nothing, but they likely share more information than you want to, are not tailored for anything, and show you lack any computer skills or creativity. \n\nIndeed and similar sites can be beneficial, but as with most things on the internet, be skeptical.\n\nHopefully this gets you out of recruiting hell.\n\n## Comment ID hmg9jtw with +599 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmg9jtw/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThank you for your post.

There are options to approve, reject, do nothing, or even \"?\" an applicant if you want to revist their application later, but every time I do one of those things that candidate goes from \"awaiting review\" to \"reviewed.\" I'm guessing that prospective employees see that their application has moved from awaiting review to reviewed.

About 40 applicants to each position; once we culled the utterly irrelevant applicants we had about 20 and have got a handful of decent applicants. I'll be interviewing a few next week. \n\nFrom the *applicant* side though, I've felt something's fishy. I just *keep seeing* the same positions from the same large companies week after week after week - and I know in my industry in this market there's no fucking chance those positions are unfillable. I'd assumed someone was just farming resumes for some reason; I hadn't considered that LinkedIn itself was scraping them to make itself look prettier. \n\nI guess the telling factors are \n\n* Is this position over 2 weeks old? If so, the company would have gotten what it wants already unless whatever they're hiring for is *seriously* specific. \n* Is this the second or third time you've seen the same job posting? If so, it's probably automatically created and goes nowhere. \n* The smaller the company, the more likely it is to not be autogenerated?\n\n## Comment ID hmhvwkk with +15 score by [(Legal_Proposal_6621, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmhvwkk/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nIndeed is becoming like the tinder of jobs.

Recruiters can be beneficial. Reach out to specific individual recruiters that have an industry specialty. Avoid the recruiting companies unless you're desperate.

I removed myself from Indeed after all Indeed-related emails I got from recruiters were completely spammy or worse, low-balled on rates so it seemed clear they were only seeking to justify Americans turning job applications down so they could bring in foreign labor.\n\nIn one case, the recruiter used a four year old Microsoft job req now long gone but matched it to my old Indeed resume on the basis of keywords.\n\nI find that recruiters often do not actually have my resume, they have the ATS scrapers like Ceipal  that send them candidate addresses. I learned this seeing multiple times when recruiter referenced Indeed resume from which I long ago removed certain keyword terms, but had never read my resume.\n\nAlso, I long ago removed my phone number from resumes posted online and yet I continually get calls (at least 10-20 a week) from New Jersey agencies using offshore recruiters. Clearly the databases used have been scraped years ago, and likely that sites like Indeed still keep obsolete resumes from deleted accounts.

A lot of their skills and keywords got entered into the talent database profile so it’s highly likely that random recruiters you talked to years ago still have only the old resume on file unless they received a new one to update it. Fancier companies might auto update resumes in their CRM from indeed and LinkedIn but I believe ours was manual each time we worked with a candidate we would update the res on file.

However, I encounter very many bad recruiters with questionable data sources and are tiny (one-man I am guessing) new companies, not any of the old-line tech recruiting agencies. Some I suspect previously worked at a bigger agency, scraped their database there, then jumped ship to start their own shop.\n\nFor reasons I still don't understand causality for, a whole lot of such agencies are in New Jersey, and many use ATS services like Ceipal. My guess is the advent of these automated suppliers has opened up an era of zero-effort to get into recruiting, and makes use maybe of Ceipal-like services that possibly steal databases. So now maybe anyone with coin can open up an agency with no research required for candidates, and they run a numbers game spamming. Now, in my daily flood of email from recruiters, if the agency is obviously miniscule and new and the recruiter is Indian, I discard it as  spam because experience over the last year.\n\n## Comment ID hmht8l1 with +4 score by [(itsrattlesnake, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmht8l1/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\n> Don't apply to anything more than two weeks old.\n\nOvertime I learned this.

Ever. They are terrible. Sure, they are better than nothing, but they likely share more information than you want to, are not tailored for anything, and show you lack any computer skills or creativity.\n\nDepends, I've recruited for 6 years and I've worked for old school employers who care about something tailored. I've also worked for employers that just need the information and don't care - especially if its a high demand field. It just depends on where you're looking to work. Generally its better to have an actual resume that isn't cookie cutter, but I don't believe it truly hurts your chances unless your indeed resume looks like its garbage with a bunch of spelling errors. \n\nIndeed all around is the worst. Its clunky, servers get overwhelmed too quickly, and the price to have a posting show in the first few pages is getting more and more expensive. Its astronomical now. It'd be better if everyone moved to a different platform so employers could take the money they're using on indeed ads and reachouts and just pay employees more so they'll stay.\n\n## Comment ID hmh0tel with +3 score by [(cybernewtype2, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmh0tel/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThis has been my experience as well.

They changed all the formatting to this really basic ugly style but said it would be accepted by automated systems much easier. And I genuinely got a significantly higher response rate after using the new ugly resume. \n\nFrom a hiring manager perspective, sometimes Indeed sends you hundreds or thousands of candidates and it can be completely overwhelming if your job is not a full time recruiter and you’re not looking to use recruiters. \n\nIf you don’t have automated systems in place to scan the resumes, then a lot of it is manual. I’m almost embarrassed about how long this took me, but I tried to be very thorough. I recently went through about 45 developer resumes for an open position and that took me a solid 4 hours. I had to manually download each resume and ctrl-f all the skills I was looking for then dig deeper into the ones that had the tech skills to get into their work history.\n\nIf a small company receives a buttload of candidates it may be just one person reviewing them who has other job duties to take care of. Job posts that are a few weeks old aren’t always the dealbreaker people think they are and aren’t necessarily a sign that the whole interview process will be slow or that no one wants the job. Once we’ve done the first interview we schedule all remaining ones for that person and have a decision in a matter of days.\n\n## Comment ID hmhrhz5 with +3 score by [(Bengerm77, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmhrhz5/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nI've wasted so much time on there.

I like to enter in things I've done recently first and then go back from there.\n\nFor example, you might have recently worked at a tire shop or something so you could say something like \"repaired/replaced car tires\"\n\"Checked/changed car oil and filter\"\n\"Drove various makes and model of customer vehicles through tight spaces\"\n\"Inventoried and transported several pounds of heavy cargo by dolly\"\n\nBasically tasks you are familiar with within your previous jobs and can say you've done enough times to not mess it up.  You can also add in independent work like mowing lawns, house repairs, ect.  Try to avoid adding complicated/niche work that you've only done a passable job of once or twice unless you are really confident you could do it again in a professional setting.\n\nNext, you add the job you did that task next to it (one square over in my case) at or \"freelance\" if it was something you did outside of a formal job.\n\nNext, add rough time frames that you did those things.  I try to get at least the years right and then if I can remember the months and days, I'll add those too.  The numbers here can be annotated with question marks or left blank if I'm not sure and need to check later.  This isn't what's going to the employer anyway, it's organizing for a tailored resume to be made later.\n\nDo these until you need a break and save it to a readily accessible computer or phone.  Come back and add more whenever you can think of it.  The most I've seen someone need to go back is 10 years or so.\n\nNow, when you apply for a job, get ahold of the job description, pull up this list you made, and grab whichever tasks you can match the words up with, some rewording may be needed.  Contact details at the top, relevant jobs with the relevant tasks next, relevant certifications and schooling after, preferred contact point and short, cordial note at the bottom expressing your looking forward to the interview.  (That last bit is my experience of confidence getting you places you have no sound reason to be)\n\nIf you had \"irrelevant\" jobs in the gaps between your chosen relevant jobs and tasks, you can just add the place of employment and an accurate job title but otherwise leave it at that.  Try to keep your employment history from having gaps but don't volunteer more than you need.  It's just clutter for most people and can get you blindsided if someone takes an interest in otherwise unrelated information.\n\n### Comment ID kuazmsr with +1 score by [(v0lume4, Reddit, 2024-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/kuazmsr/) (in reply to ID hmguq9f):\nGreat answer.\n\n## Comment ID hmhgbp6 with +5 score by [(LindzwithaphOG, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmhgbp6/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nAlso, if you applied to your current job through Indeed, your current HR department can tell if you are applying to other jobs.\n\n## Comment ID hmhdn6l with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmhdn6l/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nI found my 2nd job on this website but my 2nd job was shit.

It just sends you to the company site to apply but helps you find who is hiring to start with. What was a major game changer is when I looked up a list of buzzwords to add for software engineers and put all of those in the list. Some of them were things I would never even think to put in since they are not real skills or are something so simple it would not even make sense to put in there.

LinkedIn is usually second.\n\nIf there's a link to the company's website, apply. Usually Quick Apply is an integration with an ATS, I think, so apply. If those things aren't there, find the company's website and see if the job is posted and if it's a legit company.\n\nThe main advantage of applying through the company's website is you get to answer everything that they want so your profile isn't missing anything they deemed important. Granted, that can totally suck too, can we say 30 minute assessment test, yuck.\n\nThe age of a job posting comes into play only when it's for high volume positions (typically the entry level type jobs or the ones that are saturated - you should know if it is or not). Don't NOT apply because some random person on the internet said you are wasting your time. Again, it all depends on the type of job. \n\nYou should know if you're in the high volume, niche, hard to find, etc category. Once you understand the market for your job and your skills, then you'll understand the game better and know when to apply and when not to.\n\nI applied 2.5 weeks in and beat out about 100 applicants because I knew I had everything they were looking for and everything they know they wanted but didn't list because that would narrow down the pool too much. If I wasn't a perfect fit, I probably wouldn't have applied.\n\n## Comment ID hms0ogx with +2 score by [(loki444, Reddit, 2021-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hms0ogx/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThis is great information.

Informative, but not busy or bulky. Your job titles, company, and dates should stand out at the first glance. Recruiters spend 5-10 seconds looking at a resume and should be able to see those first.\n\nPersonalization is good, but designs or colors shouldn't distract from the actual written content. \n\nWrite the details of your employment history as a mix of job description and highlighting accomplishments. \n\nThere are tons of resources on Google images or YouTube to get ideas of putting yours together.

PLEASE do go directly to the employer and apply there. It also gives you a chance to see if the position is still posted and if it is a real posting.  Most jobs are filled in 30-days. If it is still open, there are tons of applicants already overwhelming the employer. A recruiter only needs a few good applicants to submitted to the hiring manager. The rest of the resumes/applications are never seen. \n\nI second the motion, if you have Indeed to create a resume for you, it is not at all professional, and they all look the same (elementary). Also, keep in mind Indeed is also running a recruitment business themselves; your information is now in their hands to have access to you and your details. You are now in their ATS (applicant tracking system). A lot has changed with the Indeed posting site. It is not what is used to be. There was a time when only well-known employers posted. There are a lot of businesses you have never heard of on there now. Unknown business postings/small operations are big money for Indeed, many are considered staffing agencies in their eyes.

In my last interactions with our account representative, I inquired about any projected price increases so I could submit my department's annual budget to the finance team. He said none were planned, and we transitioned into the predicted \"spend more money for better results\" convo that he constantly drones on about citing Indeed's biased data that, of course, connects recruitment success to increased consumer spending whenever he has my ear. I told him that the $5 a day per posting works well for us, and we continuously maintain the lowest vacancy rate in our industry. I submit our budget to our finance team; then the next day, Indeed forces us to spend at least $9 a day per posting. To my knowledge, before this convo, there was no cost minimum. There have been other instances where we discuss a feature, and then the next thing I know, it only becomes available if you spend an exuberant amount of money a day. With this forced increase in recruitment cost, there has been no change in our recruitment results, contrary to their \"studies.\" \n\nI am 150% positive the representatives are rewarded for their ability to force us to spend more. It is in any professional's interest who conducts business with them not to give their representative any information on how they use Indeed for recruiting. They will turn off the features discussed and force you to pay more to continue using them. \n\nThe representative is dense and does not understand we are a government-funded nonprofit that provides supports to disabled adults. CA's current governor has been throwing our industry under the bus year after year regarding funding disabled services when approving the annual budget. We don't have the means to spend the recommended minimum of $67 per day for each listing. I repeat this like a broken record, over and over and over and over and over... to the point I *HATE* talking to him. Repeating myself is my biggest peeve. If you are reading this, Tyrone C., I think you're a tool.\n\nI'm exploring recruitment alternatives to cut Indeed out of HR operations.\n\n### Comment ID kxq3wqi with +1 score by [(blaq_sheep90, Reddit, 2024-04-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/kxq3wqi/) (in reply to ID kxpy3r0):\nI left recruiting shortly after I wrote this, but I still stand by what I said. Indeed is a good source of information, but not the total package it says it is. \n\nPost-pandemic recruiting research is limited, and will be for a few more years, but there are more trends leaning towards smaller scale recruiting efforts like targeting advertising toward professional groups (like shrm to fill an hr vacancy) and referral bonuses are becoming more common, too. \n\nAs a nonprofit, you may be better off saving your dollars and trying other free sources like college career centers, govt services, religious orgs, ect. Paying local and national organizations that specialize in the profession or industry you're hiring for or offering referral bonuses to your employees might see better ROI.\n\n## Comment ID kzli3so with +1 score by [(Maximum-Estimate-112, Reddit, 2024-04-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/kzli3so/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nDoes anyone else experience this?\n\n\nJobs you are lookingfor \n\n\nCity state etc \n\n\nIt gives you maybe one then it gives you pages of nothing you are looking for.\n\n## Comment ID l2hm1tw with +1 score by [(Potential-Ebb-4817, Reddit, 2024-05-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/l2hm1tw/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThanks for the insight.

Director of TA here. We use Indeed heavily at my current company and have done so at previous Fortune 500 companies. \n\nI don’t love Indeed, but it’s not a scam. Companies post and sponsor jobs on Indeed because of the sheer volume of candidates. Indeed has more traffic (people) than the next 7 largest job boards combined. We spend a lot of money and time managing our Indeed postings. \n\nRoughly half of our hires come from Indeed. This is a mix of positions from professional to manufacturing to retail to sales. For professional positions we post and source from LinkedIn as well. \n\nIt’s also for a company to be integrated with Indeed so if you apply on Indeed, your application actually goes I to the company’s applicant tracking system. If they have one.

      "# Post ID 8s34e4: Special relationship between Indeed.com and Unemployment Office? with +2 score by [(watdonowplz, Reddit, 2018-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/8s34e4/special_relationship_between_indeedcom_and/)\nMy manager has told me on several occasions that the unemployment office has partnered with Indeed.com to track the job search/interviewing habits of unemployment beneficiaries.  This seems odd to me and I am highly skeptical. I have done some research but have found nothing to support his statement.  \n\nI am sure beneficiaries can submit proof of job search activity via what their Indeed applications yield (e.g. automated \"Thank you for applying\" or \"You application has successfully been submitted\" etc...).  However, my manager is adamant that Indeed has a special relationship with the Unemployment Office to keep track of application activities.  This all stems from the fact that I use Indeed to recruit heavily. I find it's quick, cheap, and effective.  A lot of candidates are not ideal but when you're recruiting for a $12-$13 per hour contact center position we're really just looking for a pleasant personality and a stable job history. We have a very high interview no-show rate, and my manager chalks this up to Indeed being a crappy way to recruit because most people are only applying via Indeed because they'll continue their unemployment benefits that way. \n\nSo, Reddit, has anyone ever heard of this kind of Indeed/Unemployment partnership? If you can't tell already, I think my manager is a little off on this subject but if I've been living under a big ol' stupid rock the last 2 years of my HR career I would like to know. \n\nThank you for your time! \n\n## Comment ID e0w81nr with +2 score by [(OkayAshley, Reddit, 2018-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/8s34e4/special_relationship_between_indeedcom_and/e0w81nr/) (in reply to ID 8s34e4):\nI would call your local unemployment office and ask them, all of the offices I’ve dealt with are super friendly!

The bank will take the initial deposit back in anywhere from a week to a month, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative.

It is a skills test not an education test afterall. There's also the issue of having to wait 6 months for the retake. It's definitely not fair, but of course the big lifeless corporations side with each other. It grants them more power, and the little fledgling individuals, with something called \"emotion\", shall be left to squabble. \n\nAlso it could be that the employers are paying for indeed.com's service, so they get the luxury of more info. Also the job seeker being less informed about how well they did might make them more open to sharing the test results, because of a false confidence. This could result in the assesments being used more. Making indeed.com have more influence in the hiring process.\n\nIdk just speculating of course. They just kinda suck.

I suspect that they cannot see how many times you've taken a test. You just have to wait 6 months. Feel free to create another account with a different email if you want to retake a test sooner. If I remember correctly you have to use the score of the most recent test, so you may not want to retake it \n\nWithin the past year the test questions have not changed on me. You can even find \"study\" material online sometimes.\n\n\nProficient is currently equivalent to scoring between an A and a D (or so).  The hiring team will be able to see exactly what you've scored, but you, the job searcher, only get to see that you've done better than ~65%. So your \"proficient\" score may mean you got above 90% percent of questions right, or you did get less. They don't want us to know.\n\n\nYou may also consider posting a fake job on indeed.com (with another email). (Might not be very easy; haven't tried.) And then, of course, require the test you're interested in knowing the score of, and apply with your job searching account.\n\n#### Comment ID lc2papq with +3 score by [(Stunning_Plum_5817, Reddit, 2024-07-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/12iqrkc/is_proficient_the_highest_score_on_indeed_skill/lc2papq/) (in reply to ID jxbuvoc):\nNope - they cannot see how many times you've tried the test. It is also not possible to score any better than Proficient. Employers do not see anything other than proficient or completed. (I set up and ran my old employer's indeed account when looking for my replacement). However the candidates have a limited number of times they can retry the test. Of course it is always possible to simply create another indeed account with another email address and try over and over again until the desired outcome is achieved. The tests seem to have pretty much the same questions. They may shuffle the order that they're in, and there may be a few instances of changing out some questions, depending on the Skill. But they're pretty much the same... I've seen one (as a candidate/test taker) swap out the numbers for a math skill test. Same phrasing, different variables and thus a different answer. But same principle (solve for x, determine midpoint, etc., etc.,). So copying and pasting questions looking online for the answer wont always work.\n\n### Comment ID kv0x77a with +2 score by [(DoctorImportant6339, Reddit, 2024-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/12iqrkc/is_proficient_the_highest_score_on_indeed_skill/kv0x77a/) (in reply to ID jgslczo):\nJob boards are like a hunting safari \n\n​Job boards need revenue.

Also, there's a HUGE difference between a score of 380 and 800, and to wrap that up in one rating is absolutely stupid. And like many have said, what IF the employers see the score and we can't? Like one commenter said: \"Indeed helps people get rejected from jobs.\" \n\n  \nNot only that, but companies are going to start using AI to conduct interviews (and many already have). Which means it saves them money on time spent evaluating potential new hires, while jobseekers still have to dedicate time and energy to show up and perform perfectly time after time after time. \n\nI have a pretty unique idea for a new kind of job search platform that will favor jobseekers over employers just slightly enough to give the jobseekers a bit more advantage and save time finding a job.

They make money from the business that is looking for a qualified candidate. They also don't want to alienate all of the potential candidates by showing them poor scores. The old saying is true. You get what you pay for.

And even if you use the filter to state “remote only in ____” it still doesn’t work. \n\nI have a migraine from being given the same thing over and over again. \nGlassdoor is no better.

It's as if they're intentionally trying to break it.\n\n## Comment ID jl2tu2x with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13ngf4s/indeed_is_a_horrible_app/jl2tu2x/) (in reply to ID 13ngf4s):\nGot many interviews recently applying on indeed.\n\n## Comment ID jl32i8d with +1 score by [(maddiegoldbeck, Reddit, 2023-05-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13ngf4s/indeed_is_a_horrible_app/jl32i8d/) (in reply to ID 13ngf4s):\nthey all seem like fake listings.. it’s really weird\n\n## Comment ID jl35l3v with +1 score by [(Proof_Ring_4505, Reddit, 2023-05-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13ngf4s/indeed_is_a_horrible_app/jl35l3v/) (in reply to ID 13ngf4s):\nIndeed = rubbish search function e.g. you search ecommerce and it gives you warehouse roles that have “ecommerce” in the title as its for an online business\n\nGoogle = you search for jobs in york (uk) and it shows you jobs in new york (usa)\n\nLinkedin = filters don’t work correctly and show you literally every job in the area if you use too many\n\nIts so simple and they all get it fucking wrong\n\n## Comment ID jl37e27 with +1 score by [(Antbai11, Reddit, 2023-05-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13ngf4s/indeed_is_a_horrible_app/jl37e27/) (in reply to ID 13ngf4s):\nIts possible that the jobs you are qualified for aren’t available in your area.

I put in my credentials (seeking teaching or admin work). It gives me coal mining in West Virginia or Nursing in Arkansas. What in the hell. And if I leave off my degrees it yells at me \"YOU NEED 1243564 years of experience and a PhD for this position\" or \"you must have a certification in welding for this position\". Good grief.

And the remote postings are rarely entered as remote to begin with. I have a specific finance job I do, the search results give me everything but. Since I supported a software conversion I’m seeing more sysadmin and conversion consultant jobs. I don’t know how to program.\n\nThe filters are complete garbage. This market is miserable, and it feels like I can’t even get my resume auto screened if I don’t apply within the first 24-48 hours from it going up.\n\nYou’re absolutely not alone, LinkedIn seems to be leaning in on the social media landscape and if I wanted blowhards and self-righteous jerks to read, I got nextdoor and Facebook to scratch that itch.\n\n## Comment ID jl65qcf with +1 score by [(k80mlady, Reddit, 2023-05-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13ngf4s/indeed_is_a_horrible_app/jl65qcf/) (in reply to ID 13ngf4s):\nI think my favorite part is finding a job, applying for it, only THEN to find out that 800+ people have applied to it.

Sonya & Associates (company) is waiting on you to take the blahblah skills assessment\" \nIn the past I would do it once in a great while, and it would only be for one or two jobs where it would make sense. But now it's after almost every job. I don't think the application goes through if you don't do the assessment. I keep thinking that these are being forced on me and that the employer maybe never even asked for such a thing to begin with. \nI could see indeed trying to make their assessments seem valuable/necessary to both parties.\n\nEdit: to add that I get a result on the assessments, and no where can I find a place that shows me a rubric/scale of what is a good/bad result in these assessments. I have pretty much zero control over what happens with these results.\n\n## Comment ID jwfpwwu with +1 score by [(MadeJust, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13ngf4s/indeed_is_a_horrible_app/jwfpwwu/) (in reply to ID 13ngf4s):\nI know this is an old thread but I figured I would post this here, they've completely removed filters now.

There may also be PA groups local to you on Facebook and people will sometimes mention their office is looking for someone and it's never officially posted online with the company. If you are in the same state you went to PA school, you could also reach out to past classmates who are still in the area or the program may have some leads since they deal with all of the preceptors.\n\n## Comment ID i95ilww with +7 score by [(TooSketchy94, Reddit, 2022-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/physicianassistant/comments/usquc5/whats_the_best_way_to_find_jobs_besides_indeedcom/i95ilww/) (in reply to ID usquc5):\nI used indeed, linked in, doc cafe, and a handful of recruiting companies. \n\nI only ever really got traction through indeed and doc cafe. I ended up accepting a job that I found and applied for, on indeed. \n\nI found a lot more listings when I searched more general terms. I used just physician assistant rather than that + speciality I wanted and I made the radius as wide as possible, looked up other random cities in the state I wanted, and searched again using those cities with the widest range. I also searched advanced practice provider and NP. I applied for a ton of NP jobs and got multiple interviews with people who made a listing for an NP. \n\nI’d also recommend reaching out to your PA program if it’s located somewhere you’d be willing to work. My program often sends out emails about openings places that other alums make them aware of!\n\nGood luck, happy hunting.\n\n### Comment ID i96w6xx with +2 score by [(BuckeyePA, Reddit, 2022-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/physicianassistant/comments/usquc5/whats_the_best_way_to_find_jobs_besides_indeedcom/i96w6xx/) (in reply to ID i95ilww):\nI second indeed and doc cafe.

Those hospital websites have honestly been the best. Jobs are usually up there a day or two before they show up anywhere else. I feel like most recruiters are trying to fill either rural positions that no one wants to work, or difficult to fill positions that are maybe in bigger cities. Big hospital systems don't need recruiters, typically. I did not find them overly useful and mostly connected directly with the employer.\n\n## Comment ID i97grfj with +2 score by [(SunflowerSiss1, Reddit, 2022-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/physicianassistant/comments/usquc5/whats_the_best_way_to_find_jobs_besides_indeedcom/i97grfj/) (in reply to ID usquc5):\nI found mine through Linkedin"

This department “SBS” makes up almost a third of revenue in the company yet gets treated like the work dogs. Directors have discretion on interpreting policy which makes it hard to know what’s actually ok and what is not. Varies from team to team. Directors literally do nothing but say you’re not doing enough, even to people who are at the top of the sales board. Directors are incompetent in how to actually do the job and basically baby sit. The target generating system is broken, people are making record breaking amounts of sales and are still not getting close to targets. Room for growth is almost non existent now. Directors will try to stop you from leaving to try and benefit themselves. Work life balance is awful when there is a broken target system causing stress and uncertainty for each new quarter.",

Everyone I know that's left is miserable and most are trying to get out. \n\nPros:\n-Free lunch buffet with pretty good food\n-Baristas in offices that make free custom coffees, smoothies, and juices\n-Fully stocked snack pantries and drink fridges on every floor\n-Generous flexible PTO policy (depending on your team)\n-Better-than-average awareness of social issues and encouragement to learn and honor others\n-Several of my managers were incredible and I would follow them anywhere. Top tier people.\n-Many of my colleagues were genuinely some of the best people I've ever met and really care about helping people get jobs.\n-Generous bonuses if you performed well",

Whatever you're doing isn't working. I don't make that suggestion lightly, mind you. I'm also not going to name names, but someone clearly has to take responsibility here (really, more like at least a handful of people in critical roles who I have to imagine would get a golden parachute anyway). The responsibility certainly doesn't belong to the ICs or middle management you throw under the bus due to your failures. Do what's best for the company. \n* If you're committed to these random events, at least stop promoting them as some sort of fundamental change in the industry. You're rubbing people the wrong way, and, as an aside, you probably shouldn't be spending money bringing big celebrities as speakers to your events when you're letting go of thousands of employees due to \"hard times.\" The optics are not great here, and I cannot imagine these events are so pivotal to the world that you consider it's worth the cost. \n* If you're ABSOLUTELY required to push the AI thing, maybe focus on things that will actually solve real problems for job seekers. Might I offer a suggestion? Focus on figuring out how to build AI that doesn't reject people based on biases. Or perhaps forming partnerships with other job boards and/or ATSs to ensure quality candidates aren't rejected for some silly programming error or resume parsing problem. We've seen a lot of information come out over the last couple years about how AI is broadly rejecting quality candidates before a human even gets to review them (tbf this was a problem before the AI boom too, but it's still a problem as far as I'm aware). Maybe you can figure out how to stop AI from doing stupid stuff like this so real people, quality candidates, can actually get their resumes in front of people where their value can be seen and isn't just a number. I would say that much more directly aligns with your stated goals.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "* Senior leadership has proven to be unable to \"right the ship\" and consistently shows how out of touch they are at this point. One of them (who, granted, is no longer there) is quoted as stating that an entire business unit \"never did anything.\" Insulting, and objectively incorrect. I think being faced with that error is why they're no longer there, tbh.) Let me be clear: layoffs are a management failure. Period. It's not that the people \"impacted\" were under-performing, it's not that their business unit wasn't producing, and it's certainly not due merely to \"market forces\" and \"economic hardship.\" It is a direct causal relationship from poor management decisions and lack of leadership. Every single problem Indeed has had that they say led to these decisions can be traced back to bad management decisions and/or lack of oversight in every area, going back potentially years. I used to think pretty positively of my time at Indeed, but after yet another round of layoffs (first 2023 and again early 2024), it's clear to me that leadership is utterly lost or just coasting. There was clearly far too much spent on marketing and over-hiring throughout the pandemic, and that was never going to be sustainable. Even prior to that, though, none of the \"big bets\" the company had strived for over the last several years had paid dividends they expected. (I assume at least part of this is that they cut the project(s) before they could really find their footing. Seriously, launching a whole new platform was never going to turn a profit in &lt;1 year. That's an unreasonable expectation -- yet another poor management decision, IMO.) So this is all to say that I'm disappointed in how things have shifted from what used to be a really great place that I would wholeheartedly suggest people work at. Now I steer people away at every chance I get. Until there is fundamental change, this is not the place to be. It's just not worth the risk of having the rug pulled out from under you. And, truthfully, I think the company became far too complacent as the de facto job search platform of the mid 2010s. I do not foresee a world where market share expands here any further. Internationally, everywhere already has their preferred platforms, so I don't see that really taking off, either. Unless Indeed can rebuild its tarnished image in its primary markets, I don't see them rebounding, at least not any time soon.\n\n* Morale here is a huge problem at the moment. Obviously this is directly caused by the layoffs the company now seems way too comfortable with doing unexpectedly, despite positive signals from the parent company stock. I don't know anyone who is happily going to work here anymore. They do it, sure, but the looming threat of a layoff is mentally taxing to even the most resilient, and I can't imagine it translates to hiring the best people.\n\n* The marketing approach here is....bad right now, IMO. I'm not talking about the commercials on the radio or streaming services or whatever. I'm talking about all the hype and pomp surrounding when senior leadership puts on some sort of conference, or goes to speak at some sort of convention touting how they're \"looking to the future.\" I keep seeing these things across the internet, and these, to me, are wildly at-odds with how things are actually going. I assume it's mostly an act, and fair enough. They need to be at least publicly stalwart, if nothing else, to convince people they're doing well. Given the general attitude towards the economy and the job market as a whole, I just don't buy it. Even more than that, though, I find these things to be so tone deaf. Even if we ignore that Indeed is directly causing problems for their (now former) employees, I don't think these events and all the hype they're signaling from them send the messages they intend for them to send. The market is tough. Indeed of all places should be aware of what's going on, and they should see how painful it is to their average user. Yet do they try to solve problems to help alleviate that burden? No. Instead, they go rambling on about how they're \"making the necessary decisions\" and how AI is going to help \"match people to jobs better.\" (If that's true, then show some evidence instead of just throwing around the buzzword du jour.) When in reality, all AI has done so far is created a bubble that negatively impacts the very people Indeed claims to be serving (the job seeker). (In perhaps the epitome of irony, as I came to write this review, Glassdoor was showing me one of the latest news articles directly from Indeed where the CEO shares the struggle of one of his children in the job market and then spinning that into a puff piece around their new \"AI-powered matcher\" -- which I assume is basically the same ML model they've been using for years, perhaps enhanced by generative AI. Just a guess, though.) Basically, I think these events are them stroking their ego more than anything, and I find it to be in very poor taste, especially given the extremely grim situation in which Indeed has left some of its strongest supporters.",

          "cons": "SLT does not care about their employees, there is no accountability. There is no communication between departments. Essentially, product teams come up with products or tests, and basically do whatever they want without checking how it will impact other teams. Then CS/Sales are left scrambling to figure things out when clients complain. Products are always breaking, and rarely get fixed correctly if at all. The products have gotten so complicated that even employees don't know how things work, it's basically like tricking clients into spending more money because nobody understands the pricing. Policies are changed to force employees to have to sponsor their jobs, when previously they could do so for free.\n\nI worked at Indeed for 7 years before taking voluntary severance after their first round of layoffs. I worked in both CS and Product Support, as an individual contributor, Team Lead, and Manager. I witnessed the company decline in real time. It started off as one that truly cared about their mission of helping people get jobs. However, over the years the focus abruptly shifted to trying to monetize everything possible, introducing products before they are ready, and the business losing money by not listen to CS on what employers want/need from the product. There is a huge disparity between how CS and Sales are treated and compensated. This leads toward animosity as CS does the bulk of the work to maintain client relationships and are not compensated to reflect that. Some CS teams are allowed to work remotely, while most are forced to work a hybrid schedule in-office twice/week. \n\nThe CEO regularly holds Q&amp;A's where he sounds exasperated and annoyed to answer any question. Legitimate concerns are dismissed and ignored. If an employee leaves a \"spicy\" question (ie: uncomfortable question with actual stats and is well-phrased), they are spoken to by their manager about professionalism. You are not allowed to ask questions anonymously. \n\nThere have been countless internal changes that don't make sense and then have to be reverted once Senior Leadership realizes that their direct reports were right all along. Bonus structure has changed for non-revenue generating teams, LTIPs have changed and gotten more complicated, annual merit increases are reduced and offered months later than in previous years. \n\nI will be amazed if they stay in business another five years.",

Instead they took away the only benefit that gave us all some relief.\n- Impossible promotion process, which is now even more difficult despite the propaganda that it has changed for the better.\n- QUARTERLY reviews where you have to PROVE that you are doing your job rather than actually being reviewed by your manager.\n- Colleagues who have been here for way too long are constantly trying to convince you in a rather forward, unrealistic way that indeed is great and create a toxic culture that fails to acknowledge any changes for the better",

DMs are glorified performance reviewers, and it's pretty clear they're being directed to squeeze performance reviews to find excuses to fire or hold back good engineers to avoid more layoffs, like all the big tech companies.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech stack is a mess. It's honestly baffling in 2024...it's something I would have considered obsolete in 2014. There's no time for tech debt, though, because management is so bad at managing projects that everyone is just working on experimental projects that are desperately guessing at ways to improve UX, the vast majority of which fail, wasting months of work. That makes sense for Google, who basically admitted 10 years ago that they'd peaked. Every app does eventually. But you shouldn't hire for growth if you aren't growing.",

Siloes are created and some managers use that as a tactic to divide team members and support some more than others or not at all. Career growth is associated with who your manager is and whether they really want to support you or not. Some middle managers have too much control over employee advancement and directors look the other way or aren’t present at all. At first Indeed valued culture and diversity but that has also been tainted by individuals in middle management. My former team is now all white women, mostly of a certain age with similar backgrounds and lifestyles. Only one man remains and one person of color who’s a contractor.",

Essentially, product teams come up with products or tests, and basically do whatever they want without checking how it will impact other teams.

The products have gotten so complicated that even employees don't know how things work, it's basically like tricking clients into spending more money because nobody understands the pricing. Policies are changed to force employees to have to sponsor their jobs, when previously they could do so for free.\n\nI worked at Indeed for 7 years before taking voluntary severance after their first round of layoffs. I worked in both CS and Product Support, as an individual contributor, Team Lead, and Manager. I witnessed the company decline in real time. It started off as one that truly cared about their mission of helping people get jobs. However, over the years the focus abruptly shifted to trying to monetize everything possible, introducing products before they are ready, and the business losing money by not listen to CS on what employers want/need from the product. There is a huge disparity between how CS and Sales are treated and compensated. This leads toward animosity as CS does the bulk of the work to maintain client relationships and are not compensated to reflect that. Some CS teams are allowed to work remotely, while most are forced to work a hybrid schedule in-office twice/week. \n\nThe CEO regularly holds Q&amp;A's where he sounds exasperated and annoyed to answer any question. Legitimate concerns are dismissed and ignored. If an employee leaves a \"spicy\" question (ie: uncomfortable question with actual stats and is well-phrased), they are spoken to by their manager about professionalism. You are not allowed to ask questions anonymously. \n\nThere have been countless internal changes that don't make sense and then have to be reverted once Senior Leadership realizes that their direct reports were right all along.

        "advice": "There are really only a few suggestions I can offer:\n* Resign. If you've had to do multiple rounds of layoffs and your stuff still ain't right, it's time for you to step aside. Whatever you're doing isn't working. I don't make that suggestion lightly, mind you. I'm also not going to name names, but someone clearly has to take responsibility here (really, more like at least a handful of people in critical roles who I have to imagine would get a golden parachute anyway). The responsibility certainly doesn't belong to the ICs or middle management you throw under the bus due to your failures. Do what's best for the company. \n* If you're committed to these random events, at least stop promoting them as some sort of fundamental change in the industry. You're rubbing people the wrong way, and, as an aside, you probably shouldn't be spending money bringing big celebrities as speakers to your events when you're letting go of thousands of employees due to \"hard times.\" The optics are not great here, and I cannot imagine these events are so pivotal to the world that you consider it's worth the cost. \n* If you're ABSOLUTELY required to push the AI thing, maybe focus on things that will actually solve real problems for job seekers. Might I offer a suggestion? Focus on figuring out how to build AI that doesn't reject people based on biases. Or perhaps forming partnerships with other job boards and/or ATSs to ensure quality candidates aren't rejected for some silly programming error or resume parsing problem. We've seen a lot of information come out over the last couple years about how AI is broadly rejecting quality candidates before a human even gets to review them (tbf this was a problem before the AI boom too, but it's still a problem as far as I'm aware). Maybe you can figure out how to stop AI from doing stupid stuff like this so real people, quality candidates, can actually get their resumes in front of people where their value can be seen and isn't just a number. I would say that much more directly aligns with your stated goals.",
        "cons": "* Senior leadership has proven to be unable to \"right the ship\" and consistently shows how out of touch they are at this point. One of them (who, granted, is no longer there) is quoted as stating that an entire business unit \"never did anything.\" Insulting, and objectively incorrect. I think being faced with that error is why they're no longer there, tbh.) Let me be clear: layoffs are a management failure. Period. It's not that the people \"impacted\" were under-performing, it's not that their business unit wasn't producing, and it's certainly not due merely to \"market forces\" and \"economic hardship.\" It is a direct causal relationship from poor management decisions and lack of leadership. Every single problem Indeed has had that they say led to these decisions can be traced back to bad management decisions and/or lack of oversight in every area, going back potentially years. I used to think pretty positively of my time at Indeed, but after yet another round of layoffs (first 2023 and again early 2024), it's clear to me that leadership is utterly lost or just coasting. There was clearly far too much spent on marketing and over-hiring throughout the pandemic, and that was never going to be sustainable. Even prior to that, though, none of the \"big bets\" the company had strived for over the last several years had paid dividends they expected. (I assume at least part of this is that they cut the project(s) before they could really find their footing. Seriously, launching a whole new platform was never going to turn a profit in &lt;1 year. That's an unreasonable expectation -- yet another poor management decision, IMO.) So this is all to say that I'm disappointed in how things have shifted from what used to be a really great place that I would wholeheartedly suggest people work at. Now I steer people away at every chance I get. Until there is fundamental change, this is not the place to be. It's just not worth the risk of having the rug pulled out from under you. And, truthfully, I think the company became far too complacent as the de facto job search platform of the mid 2010s. I do not foresee a world where market share expands here any further. Internationally, everywhere already has their preferred platforms, so I don't see that really taking off, either. Unless Indeed can rebuild its tarnished image in its primary markets, I don't see them rebounding, at least not any time soon.\n\n* Morale here is a huge problem at the moment. Obviously this is directly caused by the layoffs the company now seems way too comfortable with doing unexpectedly, despite positive signals from the parent company stock. I don't know anyone who is happily going to work here anymore. They do it, sure, but the looming threat of a layoff is mentally taxing to even the most resilient, and I can't imagine it translates to hiring the best people.\n\n* The marketing approach here is....bad right now, IMO. I'm not talking about the commercials on the radio or streaming services or whatever. I'm talking about all the hype and pomp surrounding when senior leadership puts on some sort of conference, or goes to speak at some sort of convention touting how they're \"looking to the future.\" I keep seeing these things across the internet, and these, to me, are wildly at-odds with how things are actually going. I assume it's mostly an act, and fair enough. They need to be at least publicly stalwart, if nothing else, to convince people they're doing well. Given the general attitude towards the economy and the job market as a whole, I just don't buy it. Even more than that, though, I find these things to be so tone deaf. Even if we ignore that Indeed is directly causing problems for their (now former) employees, I don't think these events and all the hype they're signaling from them send the messages they intend for them to send. The market is tough. Indeed of all places should be aware of what's going on, and they should see how painful it is to their average user. Yet do they try to solve problems to help alleviate that burden? No. Instead, they go rambling on about how they're \"making the necessary decisions\" and how AI is going to help \"match people to jobs better.\" (If that's true, then show some evidence instead of just throwing around the buzzword du jour.) When in reality, all AI has done so far is created a bubble that negatively impacts the very people Indeed claims to be serving (the job seeker). (In perhaps the epitome of irony, as I came to write this review, Glassdoor was showing me one of the latest news articles directly from Indeed where the CEO shares the struggle of one of his children in the job market and then spinning that into a puff piece around their new \"AI-powered matcher\" -- which I assume is basically the same ML model they've been using for years, perhaps enhanced by generative AI. Just a guess, though.) Basically, I think these events are them stroking their ego more than anything, and I find it to be in very poor taste, especially given the extremely grim situation in which Indeed has left some of its strongest supporters.",

        "pros": "Note: this is talking from the tech side perspective. If you're in CS or Sales, I would strongly suggest you look elsewhere. I have never really understood how it's possible to sell this product, but people seem to do it.\n\n* Overall, probably still a decent job on a day-to-day level, at least for a period. Do not recommend putting all your eggs in this basket, however. I used to say it was the best job. Now I can barely stand to even see the brand.\n* Used to provide ample perks and nice benefits, but that's all being either removed or severely limited more recently as the company makes cost-cutting decisions.\n* Some genuinely smart and talented people are still trying their best, and striving to commit to the stated mission of helping people. (Whether that's still the actual mission from leadership's perspective is highly debatable.)\n* Used to be a pretty casual place, where people did hard work but weren't expected to overwork themselves. (Idk if that's still he case at this point.)\n* Given the attrition, this might be a fine place to land your first Eng job? At least it'll give you some experience for your resume, though you'll probably end up working on somewhat outdated tech so it's maybe a bit of both good and bad, depending on your goals.\n* Decent severance package when/if they deem you unnecessary",

Unlike last year, where our reduction was driven by cost savings, we are taking this action because we need to simplify our organization to make it easier and faster for us to make decisions, and help us to more effectively grow revenue and hires,” Indeed CEO Chris Hyams said in a statement that was shared with employees.\n\nIndeed said that the company maintains a co-headquarters in Stamford and there are no changes to the real estate footprint as a result of the announcement.\n\n“Indeed remains committed to Connecticut. The state continues to be very business friendly, with strong support for our workforce and users - job seekers and employers. Additionally, Stamford is still a key sales office for Indeed, and integral to Indeed’s long-term plans,” Indeed said in a statement.\n\n“While the reductions touch many groups and regions, they are not across the board like last year; rather they are mostly concentrated in the US, and are more focused on R&D and some Go-to-Market teams. We worked closely with the HR, Legal, and DEIB+ teams to ensure objectivity and equity in the decision-making process. The final selections have had no measurably disproportionate impact on women and under-represented genders or the under-represented minority population in the US,” Hyams told employees.\n\nIn 2017, Indeed executives and then-Gov. Dannel Malloy announced that the company was expanding its Stamford offices and bringing in hundreds of employees to have a total of more than 1,200 employees in Connecticut.\n\nLocal\n\nIn June 2020, as the state was reopening after the pandemic business closings, Indeed partnered with the state on a custom jobs portal for jobseekers and employers looking for opportunities to get back to reopen and get back to work.\n\nFollowing is the full statement from the CEO:\n\nA Message from our CEO, Chris Hyams\n\n\"I am sad to share the news that we have made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount through a layoff. Unlike last year, where our reduction was driven by cost savings, we are taking this action because we need to simplify our organization to make it easier and faster for us to make decisions, and help us to more effectively grow revenue and hires.\n\n\"We anticipate that we will be letting approximately 1,000 people go, representing ~8% of the company. While the reductions touch many groups and regions, they are not across the board like last year; rather they are mostly concentrated in the US, and are more focused on R&D and some Go-to-Market teams. We worked closely with the HR, Legal, and DEIB+ teams to ensure objectivity and equity in the decision-making process. The final selections have had no measurably disproportionate impact on women and under-represented genders or the under-represented minority population in the US.\n\n\"Within the hour, employees outside of Ireland, the UK, and Australia will hear whether or not you have been impacted by this decision. If you are impacted, your email will include a link to the details of your separation package, which will vary by region. Package amounts have been increased for most employees over last year, and include severance, healthcare payment where applicable, and outplacement services, among others. Employees in Ireland, the UK, and Australia will hear within the hour whether you will be entering into the consultation process.\n\n\"I am responsible for how we got here, and the entire SLT is responsible for making the difficult decisions necessary to help set us up for the future. We know these decisions will have a significant impact on people’s lives. I’d like to share some context for why I believe it’s necessary.\n\n\"Last year we were facing a global slowdown in hiring, which led to multiple consecutive quarters of revenue loss. We reduced our headcount, instituted multiple cost-saving measures, and instilled investment discipline across the company. These measures worked, and we are now operating with stable profitability.\n\n\"However, while the global economy has improved in several areas over the past year, we are not yet set up for sustainable growth. Despite our efforts so far, our organization is still too complex, we still have significant duplication of effort and too many organizational layers that slow down decision-making. We have been working to simplify every aspect of our business, but without meaningful change, we can’t get where we need to go.\n\n\"At a high level, we are significantly restructuring the R&D team to align with our marketplace strategy, and we are reducing layers of management. We are also restructuring and aligning some Go-to-Market teams, and will be eliminating most of the Sales and CS roles in Foster City, California. Across the business we are making additional changes to simplify decision-making and create clarity.\n\n\"For those who are staying, I know you will need time to absorb this news. Tomorrow we will have a global town hall where I will share more about the overall org structure. This will be followed by org-specific town halls led by SLT, with opportunities to get answers to your questions. On Wednesday, we will share the updated organization chart for everyone to see.\n\n\"As difficult as these changes are, our new structure will help us to simplify and work more effectively as one team, reignite growth in revenue, and drive toward our 2030 goal to help 100 million people get jobs.\n\n\"But today, our focus will be on those who are leaving.\n\n\"Our mission is vital. Helping people get jobs is a profound privilege. Our work is driven by the deep understanding of just how important a job is in a person’s life. We all know what it means to lose that. For those of you who are leaving, this is incredibly hard. We are committed to bringing as much support to you as possible in the days and weeks ahead. You helped millions of people get jobs, and helped Indeed to be a better place. Thank you.\"",
      "# [Indeed layoffs: Austin employees who were laid off may have lawsuit, attorney says by Meredith Aldis on 2024-05-14](https://www.fox7austin.com/news/indeed-layoffs-austin-employees-possible-lawsuit)\nAn attorney said Indeed employees who were laid off this week may have a lawsuit. The CEO of Indeed announced they’re laying off 1,000 people, some in Austin.\n\n\"It just kind of came out of nowhere,\" former Indeed employee Samuel Marino Jr. said.\n\nSamuel Marino was a software engineer at Indeed for about eight years.\n\n\"My email finally came through that said I was impacted,\" Marino said.\n\nHe was one of more than 2,000 people laid off in 2023.\n\n\"I was just naive in thinking that it wouldn’t happen just because the company had been around for a while and hasn’t resorted to this,\" Marino said.\n\nOn Monday, the CEO of Indeed announced they’re cutting another 1,000 people, including people in Austin.\n\n\"Internally, Indeed was always looking for what the next product was and everything, and I remember all the initiatives being about one product or another trying to get it going and see if it's a moneymaker, so I would just speculate that they're not making enough,\" Marino said.\n\nThe CEO said the cuts last year were because of a cool down in the overall job market and demand for its technology. He said the layoffs this time are to simplify the organization to make it easier and faster to make decisions and help to more effectively grow revenue and hires.\n\n\"It seems like the CEO jumped the gun,\" Tully Rinckey PLLC managing partner Sean Timmons said.\n\nMORE STORIES:\n\n3 murder suspects arrested in connection to deadly North Austin shooting\n\nWoman still missing over a week after night out in Downtown Austin\n\nTerrifying video shows 9-year-old dodging bullets during drive-by shooting\n\nLegislation requires businesses with 100 or more full-time workers to issue a WARN notice 60 days before a plant closure or mass layoff.\n\n\"I don’t know if Indeed is in compliance with the WARN Act the way they’ve arbitrarily done this, so they’re probably going to face significant litigation,\" Timmons said.\n\nTimmons warns against signing anything.\n\n\"You may actually have legal rights in excess of the severance being offered,\" Timmons said.\n\nIndeed would not provide the number of people who were being laid off this go around in Austin.",
      "# [Indeed lays off 1K employees, citing ‘global slow-down’ in hiring by Kathryn Moody on 2024-05-15](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/)\nThis audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.\n\nIndeed laid off approximately 1,000 employees Monday, or about 8% of the company, Indeed CEO Chris Hyams announced May 13 in a letter to employees, a move driven in part by “a global slow-down in hiring,” the message said.\n\nThe vast majority of the layoffs were in the U.S., Hyams said, largely within R&D and the go-to-market teams.\n\n“While the global economy has improved in several areas over the past year, we are not yet set up for sustainable growth,” Hyams said. “Despite our efforts so far, our organization is still too complex,” he continued, indicating that the company is aiming to “simplify” areas of the business to make decision-making faster.\n\nIndeed laid off about 15% of its workforce in March of last year, or around 2,200 people, in response to tanking job postings. Hyams also took a reduction in base pay at that time.\n\nThose measures worked, he said, and Indeed is operating with stable profitability but now needs to “reignite growth.” Notably, the company flubbed the roll-out of one of its more experimental payment schemes since the start of the pandemic, stakeholders said previously told HR Dive. Pay per application, which would have allowed employers only to pay for accepted applications from approved candidates, ran into a number of roadblocks with clients when it was first rolled out in 2022. For example, many small businesses did not have the capacity to handle approval of applications before they would be billed in the thousands, one expert said at the time.",
      "# [July 2024 JOLTS Report: Unwelcome News by Margot Schneider, Nick Bunker on 2024-09-04](https://www.hiringlab.org/2024/09/04/july-2024-jolts-report/)\nKey Points:\n\nJob openings fell in July to 7.7 million, with the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers falling below its 2019 average.\n\nHiring and quitting ticked up in July, but those increases are likely bounce-backs from low readings in June. Both series are still trending downward.\n\nFortunately, layoffs remain low. But unemployment is likely to keep drifting higher if hiring remains depressed.\n\nThe labor market is no longer cooling down to its pre-pandemic temperature… it’s dropped below it. At this point, nobody — and certainly not policymakers at the Federal Reserve — should want the labor market to get any cooler. The hires rate ticked back up after a weak June report, though it’s still drifting slowly downward. Fortunately, layoffs remain low by historic standards. Overall, this report represents the exact kind of unwelcome news from the labor market that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently warned of. The labor market is past moderation and trending toward deterioration. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it has shifted some attention away from inflation and toward the health of the labor market, which is good, but it needs to take action soon.\n\nJob openings not only fell more than expected in July but are now back at levels we haven’t seen since early 2021. Openings are still up 7% from their January 2020 levels, but the dip below the 8 million mark should be a cause for concern. And the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers is now below its 2019 average. We’ve hit the spot where cooling in the labor market can’t just come from fewer job openings, unemployment will likely continue to rise as well. However, the JOLTS data can be quite noisy, and the fact that almost 80% of the decline in openings came from Health Care and Social Assistance suggests July’s drop might be overstated.\n\nHires and quits both rose over the month, but those moves are mostly bounce-backs from particularly weak June readings. Over the longer-term, these measures have both been below pre-pandemic levels for some time, and are continuing to trend down. The July hires rate of 3.5% is similar to the level from more than a decade ago, when the labor market was still recovering from the Great Recession. The low level of layoffs may calm some concerns, but unemployment will possibly continue to drift upward if hiring remains so low.\n\nWith the Fed on the verge of cutting interest rates, the questions moving forward are by how much and how quickly. If we continue to get labor market data like today’s report, then the pace of cutting is likely to be quick. Hopefully, the labor market can level off and a more deliberate pace of cuts can be undertaken. However, the underlying trends in the data suggest that might not be the reality.",

MARYS, Ga. — Many were asking if it was real or fake after seeing what appeared to be an inflammatory job listing posted on the employment website Indeed stating \"No African Americans needed.\" The ad, which was shared by a user on X Feb. 3, was for AmeriPro EMS which services St. Marys, Ga. First Coast News, On Your Side, reached out to all of the parties involved.\n\nTHE QUESTION\n\nDid a job posting appear on Indeed stating 'No African Americans Needed?'\n\nTHE SOURCES\n\nTHE ANSWER\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\n\nA user on X posted the job listing Feb. 3 on X stating \"Yes, this is actually on @indeed. Yes, @AmeriProHealth is a real company.

This post was promptly removed, and we have taken steps to prevent this going forward. One of Indeed’s values is inclusion and belonging and this did not live up to that value. We can and will do better.”\n\nFirst Coast News reached out to AmeriPro Health and has not yet heard back. On Feb. 3, the same day the X user posted the racist job listing on Indeed, AmeriPro Health posted on its X page:\n\nWe are aware of an isolated incident involving deletion of certain job postings and the posting of untrue, defamatory remarks on our job posting site. This was a malicious post made via unauthorized access to a third-party site.

      "# [Can confirm Indeed is selling user information](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40539575)\nThere are a number of services that provide recruiter tools for scraping potential candidate contact data into their CRM’s and candidate management / lead tools.\n\nSo if you ever share your details with a recruiter on LinkedIn for example, and they scrape it, then other recruiters who also use these services now also have access to your number.\n\nI was puzzled how receuiters were getting my number. I’d only shared it with a few recruiters two years previously, and now was getting calls from random recruiters. One of them admitted to me that this was why.\n\nTakeaway: use a throwaway number for recruiters.\n\nSome anecdotal evidence this is happening.\n\nMost of the time, I've used local recruiting companies. I've had long standing relationships with several firms and they've always gotten me good gigs. Once C19 hit and companies started taking applications from everybody since remote work was the thing, I applied for a few roles on Indeed since a buddy had good luck with it.\n\nKeep in mind, I never used any other platform like this. I never heard back from the two companies I applied to. But holy jesus and the mary chain after a few weeks I was suddenly getting up to a dozen emails a day from recruiters in India about all kinds of positions all over the country. Most of these places were sketchy AF. After trying to find some of them online, most just pointed back to a company profile on LinkedIn.\n\nI figured I would answer a few just out of curiosity to see if what I thought was going on, was going on. The first two I answered, the recruiters immediately asked for my social and a copy of my driver's license \"for verification\" to prove it was me that was actually applying and interviewing.\n\nThose two interactions alone confirmed that Indeed most likely had sold my information to either scammers or extremely sketchy recruiting companies who were making money selling their own lists to other recruiting companies.\n\nTo this day, I'm still deleting and blocking these companies - YEARS after deleting my account on Indeed.",

      "# [My Wampler Germanium Tumnus Deluxe has landed - indeed a pretty special overdrive, but could do with a couple of improvements by Stefan Karlsson on 2024-08-05](https://www.guitarpedalx.com/news/news/my-wampler-germanium-tumnus-deluxe-has-landed---indeed-a-pretty-special-overdrive-but-could-do-with-a-couple-of-improvements)\nI’m really glad I managed to land one of these, while it was something of a challenging experience (ordeal even) all-round. I already reported that it took me 40-50 attempts across a 9 and a half our period to secure one of these.\n\nThe whole checkout process was so sensitive - that you could not really change any of the options or it would glitch out and crash again. As a result I was compelled to go for a rather dear shipping option of c $73 - which meant that my purchase price was @ $353 or £285 in my native currency. On top of this were the import and customs charges - which amounted to a further c £75 (c $95). So my final cost of acquisition was $448 or £360 equivalent - which leaves my Scandinavian value-centric soul somewhat conflicted.\n\nThere’s no wonder I’m sensitive to pricing these days - and could never really afford to go for the new Sinvertek SHODA and SHODB pairing @ $699 and $999 - as there would be such excessively exorbitant import charges for those values!\n\nControls - Bass, Mids, Treble, Volume, Gain, Buffer push-button on side.\n\nSeveral have commented on a few of the aspects of this limited edition. The fact that it has a slightly lower output profile - which is wholly understandable (different clipping profile) - you therefore need to crank the Volume a little higher to achieve unity values than the standard Tumnus editions. Which for me is entirely predictable and no great shakes really - the pedal sounds fantastic - beautifully textured and with a balanced output profile.\n\nI tend to have it set with Bass @ 2 o’c, Mids @ 11 o’c, Treble @ 2 o’c, Volume @ 3 o’c, Gain @ 3 o’c, and I fairly liberally flip between Normal and Hot output Modes.\n\nMy main niggle is in the choice of Footswitch - which is one of those clunky brittle crunchy ones - probably one of those ubiquitous Alpha types that were industry standard about 10 years ago. But things have moved on since then and most quality pedals nowadays have either soft-click or soft-touch varieties. For me it really impacts on the quality feel of the pedal - and kind of cheapens the experience. Most of my surrounding pedals on the board feature soft click or soft touch switches - it’s really only the cheaper varieties typically that have those crunchy hard-click switches!\n\nI believe I also mentioned when I very originally reviewed the original Tumnus Deluxe - and wherever you have simple binary option toggle switches - you should rather have second footswitch to toggle that option. So in this instance you can flip in and out of Hot Mode on-the-fly!\n\nSo this is not quite the ultimate Klon pedal as many are billing it - very decent for sure - and right up there in the hierarchy - but it does have a couple of flaws, however small they are.\n\nI always try to consider the entire pedal ownerships and deployment experience - and all the little details matter - especially when speaking comparatively and within context. I also have the Beetronics Wannabee on the board (with its soft-click footswitches), and it’s Klon voicing is really exceptional - and pretty much the equal of the Germanium Tumnus Deluxe - just not quite so granular, but still pretty shapeable!\n\nI also still have the Anasounds Sandman Dual Overdrive on the board - which has an excellent Klon voicing - meaning that there are currently 3 excellent Klons on my board - and all top tier!\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that Way Huge sneaked out a Joe Bonamassa Special Diodes Limited Edition of its Conspiracy Theory Klone - a 550 unit limited ’Deep State Conspiracy Theory Diodes’ run - which sold out very quickly, in fact way before I could put out an article. I’m sure a few managed to snag both of those recent rare diodes editions - which for most it was surely a matter of one or the other! I would surely always go for the Wampler variant in such a contest.\n\nSo in short, I’m happy that I managed to land one, but from a value and experience basis it might have been a step too far in some ways. With all my acquisitions I have to balance the raw cost of the pedal with availability and likely additional charges. For a whole variety of reasons Brexit has made overseas pedal acquisitions much more complex and more costly than they used to be - which can limit my reach on occasion. And that is often why it’s so important for me to secure a discount if I can - as I’m always trying to get in as many and as varied a selection as I can each month. And excessively expensive pedals mean that I end up with a lot less to share!\n\nEverything needs to be carefully evaluated, and taken with a pinch of salt!\n\nWould be great to hear from those of you who managed to land either one of those rare diode editions Klones - for those of you who secured a Germanium Tumnus Deluxe - are you broadly in agreement with my sentiments here - or do you have a different take on this pedal?",
      "# [Just six years until my middle-aged ‘career decline’? But I’ve just got started! | Emma Beddington by Emma Beddington, www.theguardian.com, emma-beddington on 2024-09-08](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/sep/08/just-six-years-until-my-middle-aged-career-decline-but-ive-just-got-started)\nAt 49, I’ve just learned I’m in my “late career” era, according to a recent marketing graphic from the job search giant Indeed. That’s what work is like for us 45- to 55-year-olds, following “Exploration” (21-25), “Establishment” (25-35) and “Mid-career” (35-45).\n\nLate career! I have only been doing this for 14 years (the less said about the decade lost to the law the better) and this bald characterisation has given me full-on existential vertigo. It’s worse than when my best friend told me last year I was “probably peaking”, which I obviously heard as “freewheeling towards death”. Why even bother staggering on?\n\nIt could, actually, be worse. The 55-65 age bracket got “Decline”. No wonder the grey-haired cartoon hipster on the graphic is stroking his grizzled chin in apparent perplexity at being consigned to the professional knacker’s yard when he looks as if he could have at least 20 more years in him modelling for M&S.\n\nThese graphics are invariably a terrible idea, worse even than guessing someone’s age. One, a couple of years ago, illustrating a women’s “walking challenge”, showed the character representing my age group with a shampoo-and-set hairdo, flowery cardie and walking stick. The 55-60 woman was stooped, with exaggerated wrinkles. At least the 65-plus looked cool, with her furry wrap, dangly earrings and Bond-villain white cat. The content consultant Grant Feller recently described seeing a marketing presentation with age brackets for a household-name product: “the oldest of which – ‘retired’ – was identified with a picture of a woman walking around a supermarket with a walking frame”. If nothing else, you need the “decline era” demographic in the workplace to point these kinds of howlers out.\n\nIndeed’s graphic was swiftly deleted (though not swiftly enough to avoid raising the blood pressure of people who actually need to worry about our blood pressure, thanks), but it’s wild it ever existed. Are its creators aware of the current projections for retirement ages? HM government gives my pensionable age as 67 – well over the rainbow bridge beyond Indeed’s “decline” – not that I actually believe it will happen. Assuming we are still living above ground and journalism exists, I fully anticipate keeling over my keyboard at 87 (my life expectancy prediction). There’s no money left, as Keir Starmer – in the twilight of his decline era at 62 – told us last month. It’s also predicated on a linear career narrative that barely exists now. Multiple and evolving careers are becoming so common that my legal dead-end can be reframed as trailblazing, rather than reflective of disastrous life choices. Perhaps.\n\nAny “decline” is more the product of prejudice than of some intrinsic enfeeblement: the place where most over-50s experience ageism is at work, according to recent research. In July, an engineering executive who had been called an “old fossil” and dismissed was awarded £3.2m from his employer, Vesuvius, which had implemented a policy of not recruiting workers over 45.\n\nThat’s daft: for purely economic reasons we need plenty of older workers. Remember all that hand-wringing not long ago about the “Great Retirement”: over-50s leaving the workplace? Also, workplaces with older workers have lower employee turnover and seem to do better: research found that those with a 10% higher than average share of workers aged 50 and over are 1.1% more productive. At the human level, older people add invaluable perspective, experience and the ability to look you in the eye, as several did for me in the past, and say: “It’s fine. No one died.”\n\nIf nothing else, older workers are grist for the comedy marketing content mill. I don’t know if you’ve encountered the “scripted (or edited) by our gen Z intern” TikTok trend, where bemused but game older people are made to walk around their place of work and say wearing a hard hat is “very main character energy” , or that their museum’s vintage tram “slaps”. I especially like one from London’s Trinity Buoy Wharf, where a middle-aged chap has been ruthlessly gen Z edited until he’s mainly saying “ship”. They’re a nice piece of intergenerational workplace fun. Maybe Indeed should make one?"

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on Indeed\n\n## Company Overview\nIndeed is a leading job search platform headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and Austin, Texas. The company has been a significant player in the employment sector, providing services to job seekers and employers alike. As of May 2024, Indeed announced a layoff of approximately 1,000 employees, which constitutes about 8% of its workforce. This decision was made to simplify the organization and enhance decision-making processes, as stated by CEO Chris Hyams [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/).\n\n## Recent Layoffs\nThe layoffs at Indeed are primarily concentrated in the U.S., affecting teams in Research & Development (R&D) and Go-to-Market functions. Hyams emphasized that the layoffs were not as widespread as previous cuts in 2023, which saw around 2,200 employees laid off due to a slowdown in hiring and revenue loss [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/). The CEO noted that while the global economy has improved, Indeed is still not positioned for sustainable growth, necessitating these changes to streamline operations [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/).\n\n## Financial Context\nIndeed's recent layoffs come after a period of financial restructuring aimed at achieving stable profitability. The company had previously implemented cost-saving measures, including a significant reduction in workforce in March 2023, which was a response to declining job postings. Hyams indicated that these measures had been effective, but further simplification was required to reignite growth and align with the company's long-term goals [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/).\n\n## Product Developments\nIndeed has faced challenges with some of its product offerings, particularly the rollout of a new payment scheme called \"Pay per Application.\" This model, which was intended to allow employers to pay only for accepted applications, encountered difficulties with small businesses that struggled to manage the approval process. This misstep has raised concerns about the company's ability to innovate effectively in a competitive market [(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)](https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/).\n\n## Executive Insights\nIn his communication regarding the layoffs, CEO Chris Hyams expressed regret over the decision but underscored the necessity of these changes for the company's future. He stated, \"We need to simplify our organization to make it easier and faster for us to make decisions, and help us to more effectively grow revenue and hires\" [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/). Hyams also acknowledged the emotional impact of the layoffs on employees, emphasizing the company's commitment to supporting those affected [(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/).\n\n## Market Position and User Sentiment\nDespite the recent layoffs, Indeed remains a widely used platform for job seekers. However, there have been mixed sentiments regarding the company's practices. Some users have raised concerns about the potential sale of user information to recruiters, leading to unsolicited contact from various recruiting firms [(Y Combinator News, 2024-09-04)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40539575). Additionally, Indeed faced backlash for a controversial job ad that was deemed discriminatory, prompting the company to reaffirm its commitment to inclusivity and the integrity of job postings [(First Coast News, 2024-02-27)](https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/verify/racist-jobs-ad-stating-no-african-americans-needed-was-posted-on-indeed/77-ec9635d3-f236-41ee-abe0-ad3f23defb72).\n\n## Conclusion\nIndeed is currently navigating a challenging landscape marked by significant layoffs and product development hurdles. While the company has a strong market presence and continues to be a vital resource for job seekers, it must address internal complexities and external criticisms to ensure sustainable growth. Prospective candidates and investors should monitor Indeed's restructuring efforts and product innovations closely, as these will be critical in determining the company's future trajectory. \n\nFor further details, please refer to the original articles cited throughout this report."
