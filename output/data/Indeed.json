      "# Post ID r4e6rh: The ugly truth of Indeed. An HR viewpoint with +4311 score by [(blaq_sheep90, Reddit, 2021-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/)\nI've spent years on both sides of using Indeed. Here is everything you need to know. May apply to other job sites.\n\nIndeed is just a glorified parasite of a website and most of the jobs you find on there are false doors. Indeed works by scraping hundreds or thousands of other websites for real job postings, and recreates the information as a new job in its own format. An overwhelming majority of jobs posted here are clones. Applying to these cloned jobs does absolutely nothing. Nobody receives your information. They are a fake-it-until-they-made-it success story of sharing near false information to draw the crowd and then charge companies for legitimate direct postings and charge recruiters for access to applicant resumes and information.\n\nYes, you can still find some legitimate postings on here for success. Consider closer looks at sponsored positions. Companies pay for these specific listings to show at the top of your search, so there is more likely someone on the other end going through those applications. \n\nFor non-sponsored jobs, read through the description to see if it gives explicit instructions about applying through Indeed. The quick apply button doesn't count. \n\nDon't apply to anything more than two weeks old. If the posting is being monitored, it may be nearly filled, overrun with applications, or focus has moved from checking this posting to another (we are human after all). Old and filled postings are nearly impossible to take down, so most are just left to time out through the site. This takes around six weeks.\n\nUse indeed as a resource to find job postings, but then go directly to a company's website to search for the job and apply directly with them. You'll get much more information about the company and the role (if it is still vacant), and increase your odds that an actual person sees your resume. \n\nSpeaking of resumes, do NOT use Indeed's resumes to apply to anything. Ever. They are terrible. Sure, they are better than nothing, but they likely share more information than you want to, are not tailored for anything, and show you lack any computer skills or creativity. \n\nIndeed and similar sites can be beneficial, but as with most things on the internet, be skeptical.\n\nHopefully this gets you out of recruiting hell.\n\n## Comment ID hmg9jtw with +612 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmg9jtw/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThank you for your post.

There are options to approve, reject, do nothing, or even \"?\" an applicant if you want to revist their application later, but every time I do one of those things that candidate goes from \"awaiting review\" to \"reviewed.\" I'm guessing that prospective employees see that their application has moved from awaiting review to reviewed. If an employer is responsible then if they've reviewed and rejected your application then you should get an automated email saying so.  \n\n\nAlso, I know this is 8 mos ago, but please let me know if you have any more questions about the employer side of Indeed.

About 40 applicants to each position; once we culled the utterly irrelevant applicants we had about 20 and have got a handful of decent applicants. I'll be interviewing a few next week. \n\nFrom the *applicant* side though, I've felt something's fishy. I just *keep seeing* the same positions from the same large companies week after week after week - and I know in my industry in this market there's no fucking chance those positions are unfillable. I'd assumed someone was just farming resumes for some reason; I hadn't considered that LinkedIn itself was scraping them to make itself look prettier. \n\nI guess the telling factors are \n\n* Is this position over 2 weeks old? If so, the company would have gotten what it wants already unless whatever they're hiring for is *seriously* specific. \n* Is this the second or third time you've seen the same job posting?

Recruiters can be beneficial. Reach out to specific individual recruiters that have an industry specialty. Avoid the recruiting companies unless you're desperate.

I removed myself from Indeed after all Indeed-related emails I got from recruiters were completely spammy or worse, low-balled on rates so it seemed clear they were only seeking to justify Americans turning job applications down so they could bring in foreign labor.\n\nIn one case, the recruiter used a four year old Microsoft job req now long gone but matched it to my old Indeed resume on the basis of keywords.\n\nI find that recruiters often do not actually have my resume, they have the ATS scrapers like Ceipal  that send them candidate addresses. I learned this seeing multiple times when recruiter referenced Indeed resume from which I long ago removed certain keyword terms, but had never read my resume.\n\nAlso, I long ago removed my phone number from resumes posted online and yet I continually get calls (at least 10-20 a week) from New Jersey agencies using offshore recruiters. Clearly the databases used have been scraped years ago, and likely that sites like Indeed still keep obsolete resumes from deleted accounts.

A lot of their skills and keywords got entered into the talent database profile so it’s highly likely that random recruiters you talked to years ago still have only the old resume on file unless they received a new one to update it.

However, I encounter very many bad recruiters with questionable data sources and are tiny (one-man I am guessing) new companies, not any of the old-line tech recruiting agencies. Some I suspect previously worked at a bigger agency, scraped their database there, then jumped ship to start their own shop.\n\nFor reasons I still don't understand causality for, a whole lot of such agencies are in New Jersey, and many use ATS services like Ceipal. My guess is the advent of these automated suppliers has opened up an era of zero-effort to get into recruiting, and makes use maybe of Ceipal-like services that possibly steal databases. So now maybe anyone with coin can open up an agency with no research required for candidates, and they run a numbers game spamming. Now, in my daily flood of email from recruiters, if the agency is obviously miniscule and new and the recruiter is Indian, I discard it as  spam because experience over the last year.\n\n## Comment ID hmht8l1 with +6 score by [(itsrattlesnake, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmht8l1/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\n> Don't apply to anything more than two weeks old.\n\nOvertime I learned this.

Ever. They are terrible. Sure, they are better than nothing, but they likely share more information than you want to, are not tailored for anything, and show you lack any computer skills or creativity.\n\nDepends, I've recruited for 6 years and I've worked for old school employers who care about something tailored. I've also worked for employers that just need the information and don't care - especially if its a high demand field. It just depends on where you're looking to work. Generally its better to have an actual resume that isn't cookie cutter, but I don't believe it truly hurts your chances unless your indeed resume looks like its garbage with a bunch of spelling errors. \n\nIndeed all around is the worst. Its clunky, servers get overwhelmed too quickly, and the price to have a posting show in the first few pages is getting more and more expensive. Its astronomical now. It'd be better if everyone moved to a different platform so employers could take the money they're using on indeed ads and reachouts and just pay employees more so they'll stay.\n\n## Comment ID hmh0tel with +3 score by [(cybernewtype2, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmh0tel/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThis has been my experience as well.

They changed all the formatting to this really basic ugly style but said it would be accepted by automated systems much easier. And I genuinely got a significantly higher response rate after using the new ugly resume. \n\nFrom a hiring manager perspective, sometimes Indeed sends you hundreds or thousands of candidates and it can be completely overwhelming if your job is not a full time recruiter and you’re not looking to use recruiters. \n\nIf you don’t have automated systems in place to scan the resumes, then a lot of it is manual. I’m almost embarrassed about how long this took me, but I tried to be very thorough. I recently went through about 45 developer resumes for an open position and that took me a solid 4 hours. I had to manually download each resume and ctrl-f all the skills I was looking for then dig deeper into the ones that had the tech skills to get into their work history.\n\nIf a small company receives a buttload of candidates it may be just one person reviewing them who has other job duties to take care of. Job posts that are a few weeks old aren’t always the dealbreaker people think they are and aren’t necessarily a sign that the whole interview process will be slow or that no one wants the job. Once we’ve done the first interview we schedule all remaining ones for that person and have a decision in a matter of days.\n\n## Comment ID hmhrhz5 with +3 score by [(Bengerm77, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmhrhz5/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nI've wasted so much time on there.

I like to enter in things I've done recently first and then go back from there.\n\nFor example, you might have recently worked at a tire shop or something so you could say something like \"repaired/replaced car tires\"\n\"Checked/changed car oil and filter\"\n\"Drove various makes and model of customer vehicles through tight spaces\"\n\"Inventoried and transported several pounds of heavy cargo by dolly\"\n\nBasically tasks you are familiar with within your previous jobs and can say you've done enough times to not mess it up.  You can also add in independent work like mowing lawns, house repairs, ect.  Try to avoid adding complicated/niche work that you've only done a passable job of once or twice unless you are really confident you could do it again in a professional setting.\n\nNext, you add the job you did that task next to it (one square over in my case) at or \"freelance\" if it was something you did outside of a formal job.\n\nNext, add rough time frames that you did those things.  I try to get at least the years right and then if I can remember the months and days, I'll add those too.  The numbers here can be annotated with question marks or left blank if I'm not sure and need to check later.  This isn't what's going to the employer anyway, it's organizing for a tailored resume to be made later.\n\nDo these until you need a break and save it to a readily accessible computer or phone.  Come back and add more whenever you can think of it.  The most I've seen someone need to go back is 10 years or so.\n\nNow, when you apply for a job, get ahold of the job description, pull up this list you made, and grab whichever tasks you can match the words up with, some rewording may be needed.  Contact details at the top, relevant jobs with the relevant tasks next, relevant certifications and schooling after, preferred contact point and short, cordial note at the bottom expressing your looking forward to the interview.  (That last bit is my experience of confidence getting you places you have no sound reason to be)\n\nIf you had \"irrelevant\" jobs in the gaps between your chosen relevant jobs and tasks, you can just add the place of employment and an accurate job title but otherwise leave it at that.  Try to keep your employment history from having gaps but don't volunteer more than you need.  It's just clutter for most people and can get you blindsided if someone takes an interest in otherwise unrelated information.\n\n### Comment ID kuazmsr with +1 score by [(v0lume4, Reddit, 2024-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/kuazmsr/) (in reply to ID hmguq9f):\nGreat answer.\n\n## Comment ID hmhgbp6 with +6 score by [(LindzwithaphOG, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmhgbp6/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nAlso, if you applied to your current job through Indeed, your current HR department can tell if you are applying to other jobs.\n\n## Comment ID hmhdn6l with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmhdn6l/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nI found my 2nd job on this website but my 2nd job was shit.

LinkedIn is usually second.\n\nIf there's a link to the company's website, apply. Usually Quick Apply is an integration with an ATS, I think, so apply. If those things aren't there, find the company's website and see if the job is posted and if it's a legit company.\n\nThe main advantage of applying through the company's website is you get to answer everything that they want so your profile isn't missing anything they deemed important. Granted, that can totally suck too, can we say 30 minute assessment test, yuck.\n\nThe age of a job posting comes into play only when it's for high volume positions (typically the entry level type jobs or the ones that are saturated - you should know if it is or not). Don't NOT apply because some random person on the internet said you are wasting your time. Again, it all depends on the type of job. \n\nYou should know if you're in the high volume, niche, hard to find, etc category. Once you understand the market for your job and your skills, then you'll understand the game better and know when to apply and when not to.\n\nI applied 2.5 weeks in and beat out about 100 applicants because I knew I had everything they were looking for and everything they know they wanted but didn't list because that would narrow down the pool too much. If I wasn't a perfect fit, I probably wouldn't have applied.\n\n## Comment ID hms0ogx with +2 score by [(loki444, Reddit, 2021-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hms0ogx/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThis is great information.

I reviewed seven issues with the account rep and the answers I received back were not very helpful. Indeed produces the most candidates (quantity over quality for sure 😢) but that is not the only thing that's important. They really need to add \"willing to relocate\" search feature, send notification to paying end users when the site is down, send notification when they make changes to the site instead of getting \"surprises\" when you log in. They also stopped remembering your account when candidates do not reply back and trying to get assistance quickly for a technical issues is not possible. \n\nI use indeed several hours a day and my company spends thousands with them every year but yet I don't feel like a paying customer.\n\n### Comment ID ii5s1ld with +2 score by [(sklewis589, Reddit, 2022-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/ii5s1ld/) (in reply to ID ii1kqba):\nI'm feeling the same way!

Informative, but not busy or bulky. Your job titles, company, and dates should stand out at the first glance. Recruiters spend 5-10 seconds looking at a resume and should be able to see those first.\n\nPersonalization is good, but designs or colors shouldn't distract from the actual written content. \n\nWrite the details of your employment history as a mix of job description and highlighting accomplishments. \n\nThere are tons of resources on Google images or YouTube to get ideas of putting yours together.

I've experienced situations where I've done so much different titles thinking I'm being promoted but because I'm skilled enough to get the job done they us me to relieve other works.

PLEASE do go directly to the employer and apply there. It also gives you a chance to see if the position is still posted and if it is a real posting.  Most jobs are filled in 30-days. If it is still open, there are tons of applicants already overwhelming the employer. A recruiter only needs a few good applicants to submitted to the hiring manager. The rest of the resumes/applications are never seen. \n\nI second the motion, if you have Indeed to create a resume for you, it is not at all professional, and they all look the same (elementary). Also, keep in mind Indeed is also running a recruitment business themselves; your information is now in their hands to have access to you and your details. You are now in their ATS (applicant tracking system). A lot has changed with the Indeed posting site. It is not what is used to be. There was a time when only well-known employers posted. There are a lot of businesses you have never heard of on there now. Unknown business postings/small operations are big money for Indeed, many are considered staffing agencies in their eyes.  They are categorized much differently.\n\n## Comment ID jktcekk with +2 score by [(Separate-Reaction334, Reddit, 2023-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/jktcekk/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\n# I just took one of their assessments and the score was sent to the employer, but it was not shared with me \n\nI am so SICK of Indeed\n\n## Comment ID jsspsa0 with +2 score by [(Acceptable-Eye-2473, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/jsspsa0/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nIndeed must have never even read my Resume'.

In my last interactions with our account representative, I inquired about any projected price increases so I could submit my department's annual budget to the finance team. He said none were planned, and we transitioned into the predicted \"spend more money for better results\" convo that he constantly drones on about citing Indeed's biased data that, of course, connects recruitment success to increased consumer spending whenever he has my ear. I told him that the $5 a day per posting works well for us, and we continuously maintain the lowest vacancy rate in our industry. I submit our budget to our finance team; then the next day, Indeed forces us to spend at least $9 a day per posting. To my knowledge, before this convo, there was no cost minimum. There have been other instances where we discuss a feature, and then the next thing I know, it only becomes available if you spend an exuberant amount of money a day. With this forced increase in recruitment cost, there has been no change in our recruitment results, contrary to their \"studies.\" \n\nI am 150% positive the representatives are rewarded for their ability to force us to spend more. It is in any professional's interest who conducts business with them not to give their representative any information on how they use Indeed for recruiting. They will turn off the features discussed and force you to pay more to continue using them. \n\nThe representative is dense and does not understand we are a government-funded nonprofit that provides supports to disabled adults. CA's current governor has been throwing our industry under the bus year after year regarding funding disabled services when approving the annual budget. We don't have the means to spend the recommended minimum of $67 per day for each listing. I repeat this like a broken record, over and over and over and over and over... to the point I *HATE* talking to him. Repeating myself is my biggest peeve. If you are reading this, Tyrone C., I think you're a tool.\n\nI'm exploring recruitment alternatives to cut Indeed out of HR operations.\n\n### Comment ID kxq3wqi with +2 score by [(blaq_sheep90, Reddit, 2024-04-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/kxq3wqi/) (in reply to ID kxpy3r0):\nI left recruiting shortly after I wrote this, but I still stand by what I said. Indeed is a good source of information, but not the total package it says it is. \n\nPost-pandemic recruiting research is limited, and will be for a few more years, but there are more trends leaning towards smaller scale recruiting efforts like targeting advertising toward professional groups (like shrm to fill an hr vacancy) and referral bonuses are becoming more common, too. \n\nAs a nonprofit, you may be better off saving your dollars and trying other free sources like college career centers, govt services, religious orgs, ect. Paying local and national organizations that specialize in the profession or industry you're hiring for or offering referral bonuses to your employees might see better ROI.\n\n## Comment ID kzli3so with +1 score by [(Maximum-Estimate-112, Reddit, 2024-04-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/kzli3so/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nDoes anyone else experience this?\n\n\nJobs you are lookingfor \n\n\nCity state etc \n\n\nIt gives you maybe one then it gives you pages of nothing you are looking for.\n\n## Comment ID l2hm1tw with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-05-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/l2hm1tw/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThanks for the insight.

The issues I have with Indeed range from poor algorithms, assessment tests and corruption.\nIndeed AI ( artificial intelligence) is artificial but not intelligent. I applied for a high teaching job and had to complete an assessment that measured my understanding of 0-3 year olds. \nI get unsolicited advice to apply for jobs that do not match my skills or experience, albeit under or over qualified to do. I got one job lead to work as surgical nurse and another to work on a farm picking cotton. \n\nIndeed supports the employer and the employee, unlike Glassdoor.

I found out recently that companies pay Indeed to erase or reject reviews. The said review was posted for about a week, and then it disappeared.

In your case, someone likely saw the application and manually rejected it. The skills tests are also chosen from mostly pre-selected options when an employer puts the posting up directly to indeed. Some assessments can be revised, but most are off the shelf from the site.

I gave him the benefit of the doubt but as the conversation progressed this recruiter got more and more irate because I couldn't understand him. He was shouting at me. On top of this he was calling from Manchester and I'm in London, that made no sense to me. He was an Indeed recruiter.\nI don't have the focus to speak with people with broken english but everyone thinks I'm being racist. It's not racism. Language is something anybody can learn for free, youtube rosetta stone and various apps can help you learn the language the natives speak if you choose to work in their country.

We spend a lot of money and time managing our Indeed postings. \n\nRoughly half of our hires come from Indeed. This is a mix of positions from professional to manufacturing to retail to sales. For professional positions we post and source from LinkedIn as well. \n\nIt’s also for a company to be integrated with Indeed so if you apply on Indeed, your application actually goes I to the company’s applicant tracking system.

Keep in mind Indeed is often the final stop for a job, and like any job board, those roles get cancelled often due to so many factors (like \"oh great, we found someone in-house who can do the job!).  In other words, please don't take every rejection as a rejection.  There are plenty of instances where I rejected 80 resumes because I found my guy and didn't need them anymore.  \n\nI'd go over to /r/resumes and have one of us take a look at your resume to be sure that's not hurting you.  A strong resume, good experience, Indeed.com, and a decent follow-up strategy are virtually fail-proof when looking for a job.

Even if a manager wanted to promote someone and knew it, per  company practices, union rules, etc, the position to had to be posted internally, externally, and through contractor groups for a giant company circle jerk.  \n\nRounds of interviews. People traveling from all over.  Hourly workers burning vacation to interview.  So many people would waste time and hope before the manager could pull the trigger on something they knew they wanted since day zero.\n\nAnd when the decision wasn't up to a manager, they'd still stack the deck.  Internal workers with disciplinary history, unqualified applicants, and/or fresh out of college kids would be pulled for interviews to make the pre-desired person look more attractive.  One time such an applicant was slipped the questions before hand and prepped written answers to read from... the boss was slapped on the wrist and then filed a company gag order on the employee to make sure they didn't spread the fact that they were promised the job and didn't get it.\n\nThe \"dog and pony show,' as they call it, was one of the most disgusting thing is about working there.\n\nSo if you're not pulling interviews, don't fret. Some companies just don't give a f***. Often enough, applicants spend hours to fill out the stuff on the companies application websites, if the right qualifications or a key word isn't there no human eyes will even see the product of the work put in.\n\n\nIndeed is very much a Standard, but if you can - **try to find Facebook or LinkedIn groups.** Those are good to monitor. If someone is looking for Applicants on those, they're generally more serious about hiring, looking to do it quickly, and just want a resume emailed to them  (not the whole recreate your resume line by line for their online tool). \n\nEdit: fat thumbs, and predictive text aren't my friends.\n\n#### Comment ID ddg72kr with +2 score by [(sadlittleUWstudent, Reddit, 2017-02-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5savjx/having_little_success_with_indeedcom_are_there/ddg72kr/) (in reply to ID dde9zjl):\n^^ This is amazingly true. \n\nAs a new graduate I actually had a suspiciously high amount of interviews - but for some strange reason, most people would pretend that they mis-read my resume in such a way to interpret 5 co-ops as 5 separate jobs each lasting years, even though I listed clearly that my co-ops were only a few months in duration each. \n\nA lot of my interviews would even turn into roasts - and you'd be surprised how much resources companies would (purposely?) waste on doing phantom interviews.

Last spring we suddenly got flagged for suspicious activity. I do worry spam is somehow attached to us because I am dealing with some pretty bad hacking issues still. Shortly after they then suspended our account.  I called at least 50 times over a month, speaking to different agents and then upper management. All gave me a possible reason of what might have caused flagging, however they avoid telling me the exact reason, which I thought is very strange. I gave them my business license and other documents proving we are not fake or a scam. They thanked me for being so transparent but still could not release suspension! \n\nI made new appointment and management contacted me about account. I was advised to try changing my pay structure within my ads. Make more realistic and not to oversell and to keep basic info. This is what our agents make though? some actually make more than what I had in our ad... I was then advised to try to add some sort of base pay. I let her know, our managers make salary plus commission however our agent have a very nice performance based structure. It motivates and is successful. She then advised me that upper corp doesn't like to bring on so many \"commission only\" companies. I was kind of shocked! we have always marketed on their platform and never got flagged now every ad is flagged before being posted and now they are telling me to change how I pay people?\n\nThis issue began last spring and I am STILL dealing with is a year later now! It has crippled my company. I dumped a ton of money last summer into other platforms and got nothing its weird! since, I have had to shut down 2 of my offices now because hiring is at literally at a halt its scary.

I'm having something of a nightmare with indeed.\n\nI tried posting a job, and I immediately got a message saying \"account paused for suspicious activity\".  I know the scammers have taken over like half the internet, so I understand.  I replied to this message attaching my driver's license and Doing Business As certification that I got from the city where I live.  I got a reply back saying \"We do not accept these documents.  Please send us your business license.\"\n\nGod... the business i want to start is a very simple house cleaning thing.  That's all.  But okay, I look up the procedure for getting a business license.  It requires that I go to my city's planning department, pick up some documents, have the landlord of the house where I live fill them out, then bring them back to the planning department, get them certified, then go to town hall and file them in for an official business license.  This whole thing ends up costing a week of ping-ponging around government offices and I've spent nearly 200 dollars to get everything involved (I'm leaving a bunch of stuff out.)\n\nBut finally, I have it!  MY BUSINESS LICENSE!  YAY!  I take a picture and email it straight away to indeed.\n\nI get a reply back -- I kid you not -- \"we cannot accept this as it does not link to your home address\".\n\nMy home address is quite literally in 2 places, in big, bold font, right there on the license.  I'm not sure how a picture of my business license can \"link\" in any other fashion.  When I reply to them saying \"yes it is, it's right there\", they write back saying \"looks like we can't help you, go to our help page, thanks\".  \n\nI wrote back a long and sincere, genuine plea, that I can absolutely prove beyond any doubt that I'm a real person, and offered dozens of options, including making a youtube video of me walking into my own house, showing the address, and showing the desk where I'd be dispatching cleaners to various houses.  I could provide references of other people who could swear under penalty of perjury that I'm really doing what I claim to do.  \n\nThey wrote back the same reply as before, saying \"looks like we can't help you, go to our help page, thanks\".\n\nFrom there, I decided to contact their holdings company which is located in Japan and write them about what's going on.  They replied saying they can't help me, I'd have to contact someone more local.  I then looked up the indeed office in the US, found the emails of the top execs at the Indeed building in Texas, and included them in the email exchange (this was yesterday and today is July 4, a holiday, so no reply yet.)  No contact phone number was never given to me during any of this so I couldn't call anyone.\n\nWhile this was going on, I figured I'd also try signing in with a completely different email, and ask my girlfriend if I could use her credit card to try posting the job again, thus potentially getting around this block.  Different email, different card number, different name, went through the entire process, and..... believe it or not, got the same exact insta-block \"ACCOUNT IS SUSPICIOUS\" stuff from before.  \n\nI think it's time to just give up on indeed.  After all the above happened, by pure chance I found a phone number where I can call them, but like I said it's July 4th.  I'll try calling them tomorrow or next week, but if this doesn't work, then I'll just move on to monster or zip-recruiter and not use indeed anymore.  \n\nOne last thought...\n\nI've noticed when I try searching for a job on indeed, every job is super low quality, or +30 days old (meaning it's basically dead.)  I no longer see the plethora of relevant jobs from a variety of businesses I would have seen just a year ago.  I guess this means everyone else is running into this same brick wall?\n\nThanks for posting the thread.  It's good to know I'm not the only one.\n\n### Comment ID m38a7a3 with +1 score by [(UpstairsOk4264, Reddit, 2024-12-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/140z33l/my_jobs_keep_getting_flagged_on_indeedcom_and/m38a7a3/) (in reply to ID lbnm0za):\nI think they flag the ip address also\n\n#### Comment ID m38abmw with +1 score by [(UpstairsOk4264, Reddit, 2024-12-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/140z33l/my_jobs_keep_getting_flagged_on_indeedcom_and/m38abmw/) (in reply to ID m38a7a3):\nSo you have to log in from different ip, never use ip that was linked to old account, make a new llc, new address and new ip with new card number\n\n## Comment ID lc27nbl with +1 score by [(MushroomRelative6726, Reddit, 2024-07-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/140z33l/my_jobs_keep_getting_flagged_on_indeedcom_and/lc27nbl/) (in reply to ID 140z33l):\nHere is what I do.

Assessments are supposed to be on the bottom of the Indeed Profile (resume) page, but they were not there.\n\nHere's the fix - If the resume on your profile is a PDF doc (or other uploaded resume), convert it to an Indeed resume. Once you do this, the assessments section will appear on the bottom of your profile page. Don't worry, it won't change any resumes that you previously submitted.\n\nOnce the assessments sections appears, it will show your scores (highly proficient, expert, etc.) You can also click on the link next to the scores to see a more detailed analysis (but not which questions you got right or wrong).\n\nAfter you do this, you can delete your Indeed formatted resume and upload your preferred resume again.\n\n### Comment ID if2dw8o with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-07-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qhfh03/cant_find_indeed_assessment_results_anymore/if2dw8o/) (in reply to ID hiwy9za):\nPinging this comment because I am having the same issue.

Please allow me to explain about this.  \n   \nI want you to be aware that some assessments are now scored between Completed or Proficient.  \n   \nTherefore, scores like Expert and Highly Proficient are no longer in use for this particular assessment, and this will be the same for any user who is taking these assessments.  \n   \nDon’t worry Employers have been informed of this fact and are aware that Proficient now represents the highest score achievable for this assessment.  \n   \nI can understand that these changes may raise concerns for some users, and I have submitted your feedback to the appropriate product team for their consideration regarding future changes.\"\n\nDoesn't really answer the question but, well...it is what it is.\n\n#### Comment ID jea4kzn with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qhfh03/cant_find_indeed_assessment_results_anymore/jea4kzn/) (in reply to ID je9bfr6):\nI assume they see the score number but I'm not entirely sure.

Whilst I get that they might be doing this because certain levels of qualification supersede others (e.g. A-level supersedes GCSE), I'm finding that Indeed are then asking me on certain jobs to indicate whether I've \"got a GCSE in x/y/z\". Well, yes, I do, but when I added my A level / whatever in said qualification, you automatically removed the GCSE one! It's incomprehensible that one can't just be allowed to list ALL one's qualifications!\n\nAnother major bugbear of mine is also their habit of constantly sending me job alerts WAY outside of my specified catchment area/location. I mean, I explicitly select \"within 5 miles\" due to my lack of a car and unreliable public transport, but no, every job alert email, every week, contains numerous jobs at places 20-30 miles away or more. In fact, sometimes every single job is way beyond my location.\n\nI've complained, but it's the usual \"oh, there's not a lot we can do right now, but I'll pass your comments on\". Yeah, sure.

Recruiters benefit by getting the contract as high as possible. But when it comes time to negotiate your salary if/when you covert to FTE, be leery of anything they tell you. Companies love a recruiter that can get them cheap employees when they convert to FTE.\n\nThe way I play it is to ask their opinion like \"since you've placed multiple FTEs at ACME, what are your recommendations on what salary I should seek?\" Then I ignore them and negotiate on my own, even if they try to stick their nose in it. But I always ask them first because I want to make sure I'm not coming in too low.\n\nThe generic advice for converting from contract to FTE is you'll make a little less. For example, a contract of $80K will convert to FTE of $70-75 because you're also getting benefits, paid PTO, etc. I've always found that to be bullshit, even before the current hot job market. \n\nI look at it the opposite way. If I'm making $80K on contract, the company is probably paying the staffing company at least $140K. Even after you add in great benefits, requesting a higher FTE salary like $90K will still bring me in well under $140K.\n\n#### Comment ID hih3c4z with +1 score by [(NickBurns00, Reddit, 2021-10-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/qhjpq0/other_than_indeed_are_there_any_other_career/hih3c4z/) (in reply to ID hie1ljm):\nYou can use recruiters and get a FT job right away without contract work.\n\n## Comment ID hidwhbo with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/qhjpq0/other_than_indeed_are_there_any_other_career/hidwhbo/) (in reply to ID qhjpq0):\nI found this link the other day in an antiwork thread.

He told my husband that he had to be honest with him by telling him the post was there to deceive others. The company was not hiring,  and he didn't want my husband to waste time submitting an application.  His honesty was greatly appreciated.  ❤️\n\n### Comment ID k1o53o9 with +9 score by [(Green_Wing_Spino, Reddit, 2023-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/16ovyn2/am_i_dumb_for_only_using_indeed_to_look_for_jobs/k1o53o9/) (in reply to ID k1ni8vd):\nYeah, mostly I use ZipRecruiter or Glassdoor now, have gotten more offers for interviews, and also employers look into my resume.

It's hard to know where to find some jobs especially when there are few options out there. \n\nI suggest really looking at company websites directly. \n\nThat being said, how can you find them if you don't know they exist. \n\nHere is where I like to figure out what kind of companies or industries: \n\n\n1) think of a few company you want to work for. \n\n2) look up what kind of competitors they have and where they go to reach out to people. I e. Do they go to tradeshows, do they go to career fairs. This will expose you to new companies. \n\n3) search those companies to see if they are hiring. \n\n4) if it's a specific profession you have -- is there associations online for that job. If so, see if they have a job posting on their site. \n\n5 ) Join associations on LinkedIn -- see if they are talking about hiring postings there. Then reach out to the people who made the postings. \n\n6) check out linkedin or Monster.com, zip recruiter as wel\n\n7) some have networking channels on Slack. \n\n8) if you apply for the jobs look to see if your resume fits their criteria. A great app to use to help build a cover letter or get resume suggestions is something my friend built -- www.jobhunters.io \n\n\n\nThat's only a few examples.

It's riskier going to the more specialized boards because maybe the employer didn't take the time to classify the job like that, but searching under all jobs will gather all of the listings.

      "# Post ID 8yaffi: Major Indeed.com Filter Flaw [Affects Employers and Job Seekers] with +289 score by [(SDo-000, Reddit, 2018-07-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yaffi/major_indeedcom_filter_flaw_affects_employers_and/)\nI posted a job on [indeed.com](https://indeed.com) as I have done before.  I had a total of 55 applications for my position.  One of my questions before a candidate could submit their resume was \"How many years of experience do you have?\".  \n\nSince indeed sends you resumes as attachments, I checked out a few candidate resumes in my email.  Later in the morning I logged in and used a filter to isolate the people with 7 or more years of experience.  I noticed that the 3 candidates that caught my eye in my email did not show up on the list.  I thought it was something I was doing wrong so I reset the filter and tried again, this time only selecting one filter option \"10+\".  Still those candidates which had answered the question with 12 & 13 years did not come up.  \n\nI started to realize the problem wasn't me.  I reset it again but this time I selected all the filter options \\[from 0 years experience to 10+\\].  Since I selected all the options I should have a list with all 55 candidates.  However, I had a list of 37 candidates -- literally, 18 people just didn't exist once I used the filter.\n\nI called indeed support and spoke with a rep.  She logged into my account and replicated what I did with the same results.  She apologized and claimed that this was a beta feature and only 10&#37; of employers have access to this feature.  Filtering is in beta?  WTF?  Firstly, I'm not buying that something as standard as a \"years of experience\" filter is only now being introduced to indeed and secondly, why is it not labeled as such so employers know not to use it or to expect undesirable behavior.\n\nI'm just writing this post to make employers and job seekers alike aware.  If you're an employer, you might be missing some valuable people if you're using an indeed filter.  If you're a job seeker, you may not even be seen by the employers.\n\n## Comment ID e29giqz with +102 score by [(midniteslayr, Reddit, 2018-07-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yaffi/major_indeedcom_filter_flaw_affects_employers_and/e29giqz/) (in reply to ID 8yaffi):\nTheir commercials on TV advertise their filtering options.

Don’t let this aggravate you too much. I can receive 50 applicants for one job and I stop after I find one I like. I might ignore 47 other applications. Or reserve them for a later need and move on.

When you apply for a job, the employer receives an email with your name and resume as an attachment. If they view your resume through that attachment, you’ll never know. The other way is if the employer views your resume through their dashboard. The dash gives them your cover letter and resume but usually in a plain view without formatting. If they view it this way, you will never know. The last method is if they go into the dashboard and click “download resume”. This download resume option gives them your resume in the original format you sent it in (ie: word/pdf) and this is the only method that triggers an alert to the applicant.  However, this is the same file that is emailed to them when you first apply, so if they viewed that one, there might be no reason for them to ever click the download option. \n\nSo just because you didn’t get an alert doesn’t mean they didn’t see it. However, it also doesn’t mean they did see it.\n\n#### Comment ID e5fepoi with +1 score by [(SheWhoCreates, Reddit, 2018-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yaffi/major_indeedcom_filter_flaw_affects_employers_and/e5fepoi/) (in reply to ID e5faft9):\nGotcha, thank you for explaining! What do you think I should do? How can I get my resume on their dashboard? Do you think I should write a cover letter for each job I apply to, even if they don't ask for one?

A cover letter is always a good idea. Depending on the job and location an employer could get a hundred or more responses to a job but less than half submit a cover letter.  There’s a chance an employer will stop looking through resumes once they find 5-7 qualified candidates.  If you have a cover letter, there’s a better chance you get looked at since the cover letter should highlight your qualifications. This in turn may get the employer interested enough to open your resume.\n\n## Comment ID lra6kdx with +1 score by [(jallisy, Reddit, 2024-10-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yaffi/major_indeedcom_filter_flaw_affects_employers_and/lra6kdx/) (in reply to ID 8yaffi):\nIndeed.com - I had a similar experience, but from a job seeker perspective.

This department “SBS” makes up almost a third of revenue in the company yet gets treated like the work dogs. Directors have discretion on interpreting policy which makes it hard to know what’s actually ok and what is not. Varies from team to team. Directors literally do nothing but say you’re not doing enough, even to people who are at the top of the sales board. Directors are incompetent in how to actually do the job and basically baby sit. The target generating system is broken, people are making record breaking amounts of sales and are still not getting close to targets. Room for growth is almost non existent now. Directors will try to stop you from leaving to try and benefit themselves. Work life balance is awful when there is a broken target system causing stress and uncertainty for each new quarter.",

It slowly got worse over time, and after the first layoffs in 2023, it just rapidly declined. I was lucky to be part of the mass layoff in May 2024. Everyone I know that's left is miserable and most are trying to get out. \n\nPros:\n-Free lunch buffet with pretty good food\n-Baristas in offices that make free custom coffees, smoothies, and juices\n-Fully stocked snack pantries and drink fridges on every floor\n-Generous flexible PTO policy (depending on your team)\n-Better-than-average awareness of social issues and encouragement to learn and honor others\n-Several of my managers were incredible and I would follow them anywhere. Top tier people.\n-Many of my colleagues were genuinely some of the best people I've ever met and really care about helping people get jobs.\n-Generous bonuses if you performed well",
