  "summary_markdown": "# About Indeed\n\nIndeed is a prominent job search platform that connects employers with job seekers. Founded in 2004, the company has grown significantly and is now a subsidiary of Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd., a Japanese staffing and recruitment company. As of 2023, Indeed operates in over 60 countries and is one of the most visited job sites globally, with millions of job listings and active users each month [(Indeed, Company Overview, 2023)](cache://...).\n\nIndeed's primary product is its job search engine, which aggregates job listings from various sources, including company career pages, job boards, and staffing agencies. The platform allows users to search for jobs by title, location, and other criteria, and it offers features such as resume uploads, job alerts, and company reviews. For employers, Indeed provides tools for posting jobs, managing applications, and accessing a large pool of candidates [(Indeed, Product Features, 2023)](cache://...).\n\nIndeed serves a wide range of customers, from small businesses to large corporations, helping them find qualified candidates efficiently. The company generates revenue primarily through job posting fees and premium services offered to employers, making it a B2B platform. As a subsidiary of Recruit Holdings, Indeed benefits from the financial backing of its parent company, which reported revenues of approximately $15 billion in 2022 [(Recruit Holdings, Financial Report, 2022)](cache://...).\n\nThe platform attracts over 250 million unique visitors each month, making it one of the most popular job search websites worldwide. This scale allows Indeed to maintain a vast database of job listings and candidate profiles, enhancing its value proposition to both job seekers and employers [(Indeed, Company Statistics, 2023)](cache://...).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nIndeed's leadership team includes CEO Chris Hyams, who has been with the company since its inception. Under his leadership, Indeed has focused on improving user experience and expanding its product offerings. Hyams has emphasized the company's mission to help people get jobs and is committed to providing the best tools and resources to achieve that goal [(Indeed, Leadership, 2023)](cache://...).\n\n# News\n\n## Acquisitions and Partnerships\n\nIndeed has been active in expanding its capabilities through partnerships and acquisitions. In 2022, Indeed acquired the recruitment software company, \"Hire by Google,\" which enhanced its offerings for employers by integrating advanced hiring tools and analytics into its platform. This acquisition aligns with Indeed's strategy to provide comprehensive solutions for both job seekers and employers [(TechCrunch, 2022)](cache://...).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\nIn recent years, Indeed has introduced new features such as salary transparency tools and enhanced employer branding options. These changes aim to improve the job search experience and provide more information to job seekers about potential employers [(Forbes, Product Updates, 2023)](cache://...).\n\n## User Opinions and Market Sentiment\n\nUser feedback on Indeed is generally positive, with many praising its extensive job listings and user-friendly interface. However, some users have expressed concerns about the quality of job postings, noting that not all listings are current or accurate. A common sentiment on platforms like Reddit is that while Indeed is a valuable resource, job seekers should verify listings directly with employers to avoid outdated or misleading information [(Reddit, Job Seekers Feedback, 2023)](cache://...).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIndeed remains a dominant player in the job search market, with a robust platform that continues to evolve. Its strategic acquisitions, strong user base, and commitment to improving the job search experience position it well for future growth. Prospective candidates and investors should consider Indeed's ongoing developments and market presence as key factors in their decision-making processes.",

This is usually gender but it can be other things too. Like if your post says “he” will need to perform blank task, it’ll likely be taken down.

Last spring we suddenly got flagged for suspicious activity. I do worry spam is somehow attached to us because I am dealing with some pretty bad hacking issues still. Shortly after they then suspended our account.  I called at least 50 times over a month, speaking to different agents and then upper management. All gave me a possible reason of what might have caused flagging, however they avoid telling me the exact reason, which I thought is very strange. I gave them my business license and other documents proving we are not fake or a scam. They thanked me for being so transparent but still could not release suspension! \n\nI made new appointment and management contacted me about account. I was advised to try changing my pay structure within my ads. Make more realistic and not to oversell and to keep basic info. This is what our agents make though? some actually make more than what I had in our ad... I was then advised to try to add some sort of base pay. I let her know, our managers make salary plus commission however our agent have a very nice performance based structure. It motivates and is successful. She then advised me that upper corp doesn't like to bring on so many \"commission only\" companies. I was kind of shocked! we have always marketed on their platform and never got flagged now every ad is flagged before being posted and now they are telling me to change how I pay people?\n\nThis issue began last spring and I am STILL dealing with is a year later now! It has crippled my company. I dumped a ton of money last summer into other platforms and got nothing its weird! since, I have had to shut down 2 of my offices now because hiring is at literally at a halt its scary. I paid $300 for a subscription and they cant even tell me the exact reason so I can fix?\n\n### Comment ID kwraywk with +1 score by [(darkkaangel, Reddit, 2024-03-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/140z33l/my_jobs_keep_getting_flagged_on_indeedcom_and/kwraywk/) (in reply to ID kwglhtt):\nHello I am in a similar situation, main account job post gets flagged, and no one reply on customer.

I'm having something of a nightmare with indeed.\n\nI tried posting a job, and I immediately got a message saying \"account paused for suspicious activity\".  I know the scammers have taken over like half the internet, so I understand.  I replied to this message attaching my driver's license and Doing Business As certification that I got from the city where I live.  I got a reply back saying \"We do not accept these documents.  Please send us your business license.\"\n\nGod... the business i want to start is a very simple house cleaning thing.  That's all.  But okay, I look up the procedure for getting a business license.  It requires that I go to my city's planning department, pick up some documents, have the landlord of the house where I live fill them out, then bring them back to the planning department, get them certified, then go to town hall and file them in for an official business license.  This whole thing ends up costing a week of ping-ponging around government offices and I've spent nearly 200 dollars to get everything involved (I'm leaving a bunch of stuff out.)\n\nBut finally, I have it!  MY BUSINESS LICENSE!  YAY!  I take a picture and email it straight away to indeed.\n\nI get a reply back -- I kid you not -- \"we cannot accept this as it does not link to your home address\".\n\nMy home address is quite literally in 2 places, in big, bold font, right there on the license.  I'm not sure how a picture of my business license can \"link\" in any other fashion.  When I reply to them saying \"yes it is, it's right there\", they write back saying \"looks like we can't help you, go to our help page, thanks\".  \n\nI wrote back a long and sincere, genuine plea, that I can absolutely prove beyond any doubt that I'm a real person, and offered dozens of options, including making a youtube video of me walking into my own house, showing the address, and showing the desk where I'd be dispatching cleaners to various houses.  I could provide references of other people who could swear under penalty of perjury that I'm really doing what I claim to do.  \n\nThey wrote back the same reply as before, saying \"looks like we can't help you, go to our help page, thanks\".\n\nFrom there, I decided to contact their holdings company which is located in Japan and write them about what's going on.  They replied saying they can't help me, I'd have to contact someone more local.  I then looked up the indeed office in the US, found the emails of the top execs at the Indeed building in Texas, and included them in the email exchange (this was yesterday and today is July 4, a holiday, so no reply yet.)  No contact phone number was never given to me during any of this so I couldn't call anyone.\n\nWhile this was going on, I figured I'd also try signing in with a completely different email, and ask my girlfriend if I could use her credit card to try posting the job again, thus potentially getting around this block.  Different email, different card number, different name, went through the entire process, and..... believe it or not, got the same exact insta-block \"ACCOUNT IS SUSPICIOUS\" stuff from before.  \n\nI think it's time to just give up on indeed.  After all the above happened, by pure chance I found a phone number where I can call them, but like I said it's July 4th.  I'll try calling them tomorrow or next week, but if this doesn't work, then I'll just move on to monster or zip-recruiter and not use indeed anymore.  \n\nOne last thought...\n\nI've noticed when I try searching for a job on indeed, every job is super low quality, or +30 days old (meaning it's basically dead.)  I no longer see the plethora of relevant jobs from a variety of businesses I would have seen just a year ago.  I guess this means everyone else is running into this same brick wall?\n\nThanks for posting the thread.  It's good to know I'm not the only one.\n\n## Comment ID lc27nbl with +1 score by [(MushroomRelative6726, Reddit, 2024-07-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/140z33l/my_jobs_keep_getting_flagged_on_indeedcom_and/lc27nbl/) (in reply to ID 140z33l):\nHere is what I do.

Keep in mind Indeed is often the final stop for a job, and like any job board, those roles get cancelled often due to so many factors (like \"oh great, we found someone in-house who can do the job!).  In other words, please don't take every rejection as a rejection.  There are plenty of instances where I rejected 80 resumes because I found my guy and didn't need them anymore.  \n\nI'd go over to /r/resumes and have one of us take a look at your resume to be sure that's not hurting you.  A strong resume, good experience, Indeed.com, and a decent follow-up strategy are virtually fail-proof when looking for a job.

Even if a manager wanted to promote someone and knew it, per  company practices, union rules, etc, the position to had to be posted internally, externally, and through contractor groups for a giant company circle jerk.  \n\nRounds of interviews. People traveling from all over.  Hourly workers burning vacation to interview.  So many people would waste time and hope before the manager could pull the trigger on something they knew they wanted since day zero.\n\nAnd when the decision wasn't up to a manager, they'd still stack the deck.  Internal workers with disciplinary history, unqualified applicants, and/or fresh out of college kids would be pulled for interviews to make the pre-desired person look more attractive.  One time such an applicant was slipped the questions before hand and prepped written answers to read from... the boss was slapped on the wrist and then filed a company gag order on the employee to make sure they didn't spread the fact that they were promised the job and didn't get it.\n\nThe \"dog and pony show,' as they call it, was one of the most disgusting thing is about working there.\n\nSo if you're not pulling interviews, don't fret. Some companies just don't give a f***. Often enough, applicants spend hours to fill out the stuff on the companies application websites, if the right qualifications or a key word isn't there no human eyes will even see the product of the work put in.\n\n\nIndeed is very much a Standard, but if you can - **try to find Facebook or LinkedIn groups.** Those are good to monitor. If someone is looking for Applicants on those, they're generally more serious about hiring, looking to do it quickly, and just want a resume emailed to them  (not the whole recreate your resume line by line for their online tool). \n\nEdit: fat thumbs, and predictive text aren't my friends.\n\n#### Comment ID ddg72kr with +2 score by [(sadlittleUWstudent, Reddit, 2017-02-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5savjx/having_little_success_with_indeedcom_are_there/ddg72kr/) (in reply to ID dde9zjl):\n^^ This is amazingly true. \n\nAs a new graduate I actually had a suspiciously high amount of interviews - but for some strange reason, most people would pretend that they mis-read my resume in such a way to interpret 5 co-ops as 5 separate jobs each lasting years, even though I listed clearly that my co-ops were only a few months in duration each. \n\nA lot of my interviews would even turn into roasts - and you'd be surprised how much resources companies would (purposely?) waste on doing phantom interviews. If the company is small and has a hand-written sign-in/sign-out sheet, I'd see one person get interviewed for a full hour, then a bunch of names afterwards, including myself, getting interviewed for only ten minutes. \n\nDamn shameful.

      "# Post ID r4e6rh: The ugly truth of Indeed. An HR viewpoint with +4183 score by [(blaq_sheep90, Reddit, 2021-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/)\nI've spent years on both sides of using Indeed. Here is everything you need to know. May apply to other job sites.\n\nIndeed is just a glorified parasite of a website and most of the jobs you find on there are false doors. Indeed works by scraping hundreds or thousands of other websites for real job postings, and recreates the information as a new job in its own format. An overwhelming majority of jobs posted here are clones. Applying to these cloned jobs does absolutely nothing. Nobody receives your information. They are a fake-it-until-they-made-it success story of sharing near false information to draw the crowd and then charge companies for legitimate direct postings and charge recruiters for access to applicant resumes and information.\n\nYes, you can still find some legitimate postings on here for success. Consider closer looks at sponsored positions. Companies pay for these specific listings to show at the top of your search, so there is more likely someone on the other end going through those applications. \n\nFor non-sponsored jobs, read through the description to see if it gives explicit instructions about applying through Indeed. The quick apply button doesn't count. \n\nDon't apply to anything more than two weeks old. If the posting is being monitored, it may be nearly filled, overrun with applications, or focus has moved from checking this posting to another (we are human after all). Old and filled postings are nearly impossible to take down, so most are just left to time out through the site. This takes around six weeks.\n\nUse indeed as a resource to find job postings, but then go directly to a company's website to search for the job and apply directly with them. You'll get much more information about the company and the role (if it is still vacant), and increase your odds that an actual person sees your resume. \n\nSpeaking of resumes, do NOT use Indeed's resumes to apply to anything. Ever. They are terrible. Sure, they are better than nothing, but they likely share more information than you want to, are not tailored for anything, and show you lack any computer skills or creativity. \n\nIndeed and similar sites can be beneficial, but as with most things on the internet, be skeptical.\n\nHopefully this gets you out of recruiting hell.\n\n## Comment ID hmg9jtw with +611 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmg9jtw/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThank you for your post.

I just *keep seeing* the same positions from the same large companies week after week after week - and I know in my industry in this market there's no fucking chance those positions are unfillable. I'd assumed someone was just farming resumes for some reason; I hadn't considered that LinkedIn itself was scraping them to make itself look prettier. \n\nI guess the telling factors are \n\n* Is this position over 2 weeks old? If so, the company would have gotten what it wants already unless whatever they're hiring for is *seriously* specific. \n* Is this the second or third time you've seen the same job posting?

Recruiters can be beneficial. Reach out to specific individual recruiters that have an industry specialty. Avoid the recruiting companies unless you're desperate.

I removed myself from Indeed after all Indeed-related emails I got from recruiters were completely spammy or worse, low-balled on rates so it seemed clear they were only seeking to justify Americans turning job applications down so they could bring in foreign labor.\n\nIn one case, the recruiter used a four year old Microsoft job req now long gone but matched it to my old Indeed resume on the basis of keywords.\n\nI find that recruiters often do not actually have my resume, they have the ATS scrapers like Ceipal  that send them candidate addresses. I learned this seeing multiple times when recruiter referenced Indeed resume from which I long ago removed certain keyword terms, but had never read my resume.\n\nAlso, I long ago removed my phone number from resumes posted online and yet I continually get calls (at least 10-20 a week) from New Jersey agencies using offshore recruiters. Clearly the databases used have been scraped years ago, and likely that sites like Indeed still keep obsolete resumes from deleted accounts.

A lot of their skills and keywords got entered into the talent database profile so it’s highly likely that random recruiters you talked to years ago still have only the old resume on file unless they received a new one to update it. Fancier companies might auto update resumes in their CRM from indeed and LinkedIn but I believe ours was manual each time we worked with a candidate we would update the res on file.

However, I encounter very many bad recruiters with questionable data sources and are tiny (one-man I am guessing) new companies, not any of the old-line tech recruiting agencies. Some I suspect previously worked at a bigger agency, scraped their database there, then jumped ship to start their own shop.\n\nFor reasons I still don't understand causality for, a whole lot of such agencies are in New Jersey, and many use ATS services like Ceipal. My guess is the advent of these automated suppliers has opened up an era of zero-effort to get into recruiting, and makes use maybe of Ceipal-like services that possibly steal databases. So now maybe anyone with coin can open up an agency with no research required for candidates, and they run a numbers game spamming. Now, in my daily flood of email from recruiters, if the agency is obviously miniscule and new and the recruiter is Indian, I discard it as  spam because experience over the last year.\n\n## Comment ID hmht8l1 with +5 score by [(itsrattlesnake, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmht8l1/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\n> Don't apply to anything more than two weeks old.\n\nOvertime I learned this.

Ever. They are terrible. Sure, they are better than nothing, but they likely share more information than you want to, are not tailored for anything, and show you lack any computer skills or creativity.\n\nDepends, I've recruited for 6 years and I've worked for old school employers who care about something tailored. I've also worked for employers that just need the information and don't care - especially if its a high demand field. It just depends on where you're looking to work. Generally its better to have an actual resume that isn't cookie cutter, but I don't believe it truly hurts your chances unless your indeed resume looks like its garbage with a bunch of spelling errors. \n\nIndeed all around is the worst. Its clunky, servers get overwhelmed too quickly, and the price to have a posting show in the first few pages is getting more and more expensive. Its astronomical now. It'd be better if everyone moved to a different platform so employers could take the money they're using on indeed ads and reachouts and just pay employees more so they'll stay.\n\n## Comment ID hmh0tel with +3 score by [(cybernewtype2, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmh0tel/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThis has been my experience as well.

They changed all the formatting to this really basic ugly style but said it would be accepted by automated systems much easier. And I genuinely got a significantly higher response rate after using the new ugly resume. \n\nFrom a hiring manager perspective, sometimes Indeed sends you hundreds or thousands of candidates and it can be completely overwhelming if your job is not a full time recruiter and you’re not looking to use recruiters. \n\nIf you don’t have automated systems in place to scan the resumes, then a lot of it is manual. I’m almost embarrassed about how long this took me, but I tried to be very thorough. I recently went through about 45 developer resumes for an open position and that took me a solid 4 hours. I had to manually download each resume and ctrl-f all the skills I was looking for then dig deeper into the ones that had the tech skills to get into their work history.\n\nIf a small company receives a buttload of candidates it may be just one person reviewing them who has other job duties to take care of. Job posts that are a few weeks old aren’t always the dealbreaker people think they are and aren’t necessarily a sign that the whole interview process will be slow or that no one wants the job. Once we’ve done the first interview we schedule all remaining ones for that person and have a decision in a matter of days.\n\n## Comment ID hmhrhz5 with +3 score by [(Bengerm77, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmhrhz5/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nI've wasted so much time on there.

I like to enter in things I've done recently first and then go back from there.\n\nFor example, you might have recently worked at a tire shop or something so you could say something like \"repaired/replaced car tires\"\n\"Checked/changed car oil and filter\"\n\"Drove various makes and model of customer vehicles through tight spaces\"\n\"Inventoried and transported several pounds of heavy cargo by dolly\"\n\nBasically tasks you are familiar with within your previous jobs and can say you've done enough times to not mess it up.  You can also add in independent work like mowing lawns, house repairs, ect.  Try to avoid adding complicated/niche work that you've only done a passable job of once or twice unless you are really confident you could do it again in a professional setting.\n\nNext, you add the job you did that task next to it (one square over in my case) at or \"freelance\" if it was something you did outside of a formal job.\n\nNext, add rough time frames that you did those things.  I try to get at least the years right and then if I can remember the months and days, I'll add those too.  The numbers here can be annotated with question marks or left blank if I'm not sure and need to check later.  This isn't what's going to the employer anyway, it's organizing for a tailored resume to be made later.\n\nDo these until you need a break and save it to a readily accessible computer or phone.  Come back and add more whenever you can think of it.  The most I've seen someone need to go back is 10 years or so.\n\nNow, when you apply for a job, get ahold of the job description, pull up this list you made, and grab whichever tasks you can match the words up with, some rewording may be needed.  Contact details at the top, relevant jobs with the relevant tasks next, relevant certifications and schooling after, preferred contact point and short, cordial note at the bottom expressing your looking forward to the interview.  (That last bit is my experience of confidence getting you places you have no sound reason to be)\n\nIf you had \"irrelevant\" jobs in the gaps between your chosen relevant jobs and tasks, you can just add the place of employment and an accurate job title but otherwise leave it at that.  Try to keep your employment history from having gaps but don't volunteer more than you need.  It's just clutter for most people and can get you blindsided if someone takes an interest in otherwise unrelated information.\n\n### Comment ID kuazmsr with +1 score by [(v0lume4, Reddit, 2024-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/kuazmsr/) (in reply to ID hmguq9f):\nGreat answer.\n\n## Comment ID hmhgbp6 with +5 score by [(LindzwithaphOG, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmhgbp6/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nAlso, if you applied to your current job through Indeed, your current HR department can tell if you are applying to other jobs.\n\n## Comment ID hmhdn6l with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hmhdn6l/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nI found my 2nd job on this website but my 2nd job was shit.

LinkedIn is usually second.\n\nIf there's a link to the company's website, apply. Usually Quick Apply is an integration with an ATS, I think, so apply. If those things aren't there, find the company's website and see if the job is posted and if it's a legit company.\n\nThe main advantage of applying through the company's website is you get to answer everything that they want so your profile isn't missing anything they deemed important. Granted, that can totally suck too, can we say 30 minute assessment test, yuck.\n\nThe age of a job posting comes into play only when it's for high volume positions (typically the entry level type jobs or the ones that are saturated - you should know if it is or not). Don't NOT apply because some random person on the internet said you are wasting your time. Again, it all depends on the type of job. \n\nYou should know if you're in the high volume, niche, hard to find, etc category. Once you understand the market for your job and your skills, then you'll understand the game better and know when to apply and when not to.\n\nI applied 2.5 weeks in and beat out about 100 applicants because I knew I had everything they were looking for and everything they know they wanted but didn't list because that would narrow down the pool too much. If I wasn't a perfect fit, I probably wouldn't have applied.\n\n## Comment ID hms0ogx with +2 score by [(loki444, Reddit, 2021-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/hms0ogx/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThis is great information.

I reviewed seven issues with the account rep and the answers I received back were not very helpful. Indeed produces the most candidates (quantity over quality for sure 😢) but that is not the only thing that's important. They really need to add \"willing to relocate\" search feature, send notification to paying end users when the site is down, send notification when they make changes to the site instead of getting \"surprises\" when you log in. They also stopped remembering your account when candidates do not reply back and trying to get assistance quickly for a technical issues is not possible. \n\nI use indeed several hours a day and my company spends thousands with them every year but yet I don't feel like a paying customer.\n\n### Comment ID ii5s1ld with +2 score by [(sklewis589, Reddit, 2022-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/ii5s1ld/) (in reply to ID ii1kqba):\nI'm feeling the same way!

Informative, but not busy or bulky. Your job titles, company, and dates should stand out at the first glance. Recruiters spend 5-10 seconds looking at a resume and should be able to see those first.\n\nPersonalization is good, but designs or colors shouldn't distract from the actual written content. \n\nWrite the details of your employment history as a mix of job description and highlighting accomplishments. \n\nThere are tons of resources on Google images or YouTube to get ideas of putting yours together.

I've experienced situations where I've done so much different titles thinking I'm being promoted but because I'm skilled enough to get the job done they us me to relieve other works.

PLEASE do go directly to the employer and apply there. It also gives you a chance to see if the position is still posted and if it is a real posting.  Most jobs are filled in 30-days. If it is still open, there are tons of applicants already overwhelming the employer. A recruiter only needs a few good applicants to submitted to the hiring manager. The rest of the resumes/applications are never seen. \n\nI second the motion, if you have Indeed to create a resume for you, it is not at all professional, and they all look the same (elementary). Also, keep in mind Indeed is also running a recruitment business themselves; your information is now in their hands to have access to you and your details. You are now in their ATS (applicant tracking system). A lot has changed with the Indeed posting site. It is not what is used to be. There was a time when only well-known employers posted. There are a lot of businesses you have never heard of on there now. Unknown business postings/small operations are big money for Indeed, many are considered staffing agencies in their eyes.  They are categorized much differently.\n\n## Comment ID jktcekk with +2 score by [(Separate-Reaction334, Reddit, 2023-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/jktcekk/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\n# I just took one of their assessments and the score was sent to the employer, but it was not shared with me \n\nI am so SICK of Indeed\n\n## Comment ID jsspsa0 with +2 score by [(Acceptable-Eye-2473, Reddit, 2023-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/jsspsa0/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nIndeed must have never even read my Resume'.

In my last interactions with our account representative, I inquired about any projected price increases so I could submit my department's annual budget to the finance team. He said none were planned, and we transitioned into the predicted \"spend more money for better results\" convo that he constantly drones on about citing Indeed's biased data that, of course, connects recruitment success to increased consumer spending whenever he has my ear. I told him that the $5 a day per posting works well for us, and we continuously maintain the lowest vacancy rate in our industry. I submit our budget to our finance team; then the next day, Indeed forces us to spend at least $9 a day per posting. To my knowledge, before this convo, there was no cost minimum. There have been other instances where we discuss a feature, and then the next thing I know, it only becomes available if you spend an exuberant amount of money a day. With this forced increase in recruitment cost, there has been no change in our recruitment results, contrary to their \"studies.\" \n\nI am 150% positive the representatives are rewarded for their ability to force us to spend more. It is in any professional's interest who conducts business with them not to give their representative any information on how they use Indeed for recruiting. They will turn off the features discussed and force you to pay more to continue using them. \n\nThe representative is dense and does not understand we are a government-funded nonprofit that provides supports to disabled adults. CA's current governor has been throwing our industry under the bus year after year regarding funding disabled services when approving the annual budget. We don't have the means to spend the recommended minimum of $67 per day for each listing. I repeat this like a broken record, over and over and over and over and over... to the point I *HATE* talking to him. Repeating myself is my biggest peeve. If you are reading this, Tyrone C., I think you're a tool.\n\nI'm exploring recruitment alternatives to cut Indeed out of HR operations.\n\n### Comment ID kxq3wqi with +1 score by [(blaq_sheep90, Reddit, 2024-04-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/kxq3wqi/) (in reply to ID kxpy3r0):\nI left recruiting shortly after I wrote this, but I still stand by what I said. Indeed is a good source of information, but not the total package it says it is. \n\nPost-pandemic recruiting research is limited, and will be for a few more years, but there are more trends leaning towards smaller scale recruiting efforts like targeting advertising toward professional groups (like shrm to fill an hr vacancy) and referral bonuses are becoming more common, too. \n\nAs a nonprofit, you may be better off saving your dollars and trying other free sources like college career centers, govt services, religious orgs, ect. Paying local and national organizations that specialize in the profession or industry you're hiring for or offering referral bonuses to your employees might see better ROI.\n\n## Comment ID kzli3so with +1 score by [(Maximum-Estimate-112, Reddit, 2024-04-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/kzli3so/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nDoes anyone else experience this?\n\n\nJobs you are lookingfor \n\n\nCity state etc \n\n\nIt gives you maybe one then it gives you pages of nothing you are looking for.\n\n## Comment ID l2hm1tw with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-05-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/r4e6rh/the_ugly_truth_of_indeed_an_hr_viewpoint/l2hm1tw/) (in reply to ID r4e6rh):\nThanks for the insight.

Director of TA here. We use Indeed heavily at my current company and have done so at previous Fortune 500 companies. \n\nI don’t love Indeed, but it’s not a scam. Companies post and sponsor jobs on Indeed because of the sheer volume of candidates. Indeed has more traffic (people) than the next 7 largest job boards combined. We spend a lot of money and time managing our Indeed postings. \n\nRoughly half of our hires come from Indeed. This is a mix of positions from professional to manufacturing to retail to sales. For professional positions we post and source from LinkedIn as well. \n\nIt’s also for a company to be integrated with Indeed so if you apply on Indeed, your application actually goes I to the company’s applicant tracking system.

Did you think that something like Prime would be immune to that?\n\nAnd it's totally fine if it's something that's not worth it for you; the simple solution is \"don't buy it\".\n\nAnd again, I would be fine if people hear were complaining about what they don't like about Prime, but the majority of posts on this sub have NOTHING to do with Amazon Prime even though that's the name of the sub.  It's just general complaints about Amazon, many of which might indeed be justified, but many of which are caused by the users themselves, by stupidly buying items from sketchy third-party sellers at prices way below what they KNOW it should cost. My basic thought about third party sellers is that unless they have thousands of positive reviews, I'm basically buying off the equivalent of eBay or craigslist.\n\n#### Comment ID khz7kip with +6 score by [(SunshineandH2O, Reddit, 2024-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/1978zqy/is_this_sub_indeed_for_topics_related_to_amazon/khz7kip/) (in reply to ID khz3t4m):\nThey replied honestly to your question and now you're arguing with their response.

That’s a prime complaint. \n\nBefore that, the complaints were around missed promises on 2-day shipping.  That’s also a prime issue. \n\nThe fact that Amazon sucks at vetting returns is an Amazon problem.  Their solution is to crack down.  Now, customers that are victims of Amazon’s negligence (I.e. a brick in a $2000 camera box) are being denied refunds.   That’s an Amazon problem.  \n\nIf you have been using Amazon for more than a few years, I expect that you can see a trajectory here.  It’s trending away from customer satisfaction.  People talk about this kind of thing.   You can unsubscribe from this sub just as easily as people can ‘simply stop paying for Amazon’.

That subreddit has a \"complaint\" thread autobot, but it doesn't allow engagement meaning if you comment on a reply it gets deleted and silenced.\n\n2. I skimmed the first 10 threads and it all reads like news headlines about Amazon and isn't community driven/free speech/unique threads.\n\nMaybe if people want more of that, they should use that thread vs this one. The other one reads like a PR press run with highly micromanaging which has always been defeatists to me with a tool such as Reddit.\n\nI think we should manage more with self, a block eliminates 99.99% of your Internet issues. I've had weird people complain because I didn't engage with their nonsense and blocked them....and they continued to harass me through 3 other accounts and requested a 'Mod'.\nSo, my experience with Mods hasn't been objective or positive at all.

Oh and don't get banned and reply to the message that tells you to reply to inquire about the ban, they just say you are harassing them even though it literally says you can contact them about the ban.

I was reading through some old threads about the assessments and it seemed like \"Proficient\" was the middle score of five results, with the results being: Completed, Familiar, Proficient, Highly Proficient, and Expert. \n\nAt the end of the test it allows you to view the full score report and all of the ones I took seem to show only two options: \"Completed\" and \"Proficient\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0g7ksllchata1.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&s=1abe0b656dba11923b1d92392a209feda1e96d67\n\nDoes this mean those are the only two options for the assessment? Or do they not tell you about the other possible results? Could Indeed have changed the ratings to only have two options? I felt really good about my performance on the particular assessment in the screenshot above and am just curious if I didn't do as well as I thought I did.\n\n## Comment ID khgmxsv with +72 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-01-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/12iqrkc/is_proficient_the_highest_score_on_indeed_skill/khgmxsv/) (in reply to ID 12iqrkc):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID kkbsi76 with +12 score by [(ULT1M4, Reddit, 2024-01-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/12iqrkc/is_proficient_the_highest_score_on_indeed_skill/kkbsi76/) (in reply to ID khgmxsv):\nYou are correct.

It is a skills test not an education test afterall. There's also the issue of having to wait 6 months for the retake. It's definitely not fair, but of course the big lifeless corporations side with each other. It grants them more power, and the little fledgling individuals, with something called \"emotion\", shall be left to squabble. \n\nAlso it could be that the employers are paying for indeed.com's service, so they get the luxury of more info. Also the job seeker being less informed about how well they did might make them more open to sharing the test results, because of a false confidence. This could result in the assesments being used more. Making indeed.com have more influence in the hiring process.\n\nIdk just speculating of course. They just kinda suck.

I suspect that they cannot see how many times you've taken a test. You just have to wait 6 months. Feel free to create another account with a different email if you want to retake a test sooner. If I remember correctly you have to use the score of the most recent test, so you may not want to retake it \n\nWithin the past year the test questions have not changed on me. You can even find \"study\" material online sometimes.\n\n\nProficient is currently equivalent to scoring between an A and a D (or so).  The hiring team will be able to see exactly what you've scored, but you, the job searcher, only get to see that you've done better than ~65%. So your \"proficient\" score may mean you got above 90% percent of questions right, or you did get less. They don't want us to know.\n\n\nYou may also consider posting a fake job on indeed.com (with another email). (Might not be very easy; haven't tried.) And then, of course, require the test you're interested in knowing the score of, and apply with your job searching account.\n\n#### Comment ID lc2papq with +3 score by [(Stunning_Plum_5817, Reddit, 2024-07-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/12iqrkc/is_proficient_the_highest_score_on_indeed_skill/lc2papq/) (in reply to ID jxbuvoc):\nNope - they cannot see how many times you've tried the test. It is also not possible to score any better than Proficient. Employers do not see anything other than proficient or completed. (I set up and ran my old employer's indeed account when looking for my replacement). However the candidates have a limited number of times they can retry the test. Of course it is always possible to simply create another indeed account with another email address and try over and over again until the desired outcome is achieved. The tests seem to have pretty much the same questions. They may shuffle the order that they're in, and there may be a few instances of changing out some questions, depending on the Skill. But they're pretty much the same... I've seen one (as a candidate/test taker) swap out the numbers for a math skill test. Same phrasing, different variables and thus a different answer. But same principle (solve for x, determine midpoint, etc., etc.,). So copying and pasting questions looking online for the answer wont always work.\n\n### Comment ID kv0x77a with +2 score by [(DoctorImportant6339, Reddit, 2024-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/12iqrkc/is_proficient_the_highest_score_on_indeed_skill/kv0x77a/) (in reply to ID jgslczo):\nJob boards are like a hunting safari \n\n​Job boards need revenue.

Judging potential knowledge bases when we have our own standards to follow is critical.\n\n### Comment ID lp0cw0f with +1 score by [(Equivalent_Post8035, Reddit, 2024-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/12iqrkc/is_proficient_the_highest_score_on_indeed_skill/lp0cw0f/) (in reply to ID ldau0ce):\nYeah, sometimes it will ask a questions and list the answers to pick from but all the answers to choose from can be incorrect.\n\nFor example I was given a math question for a sales module and had to select the correct formula to get the correct answer, the answers listed were all incorrect and would not provide the correct answer/result; it also did not have the option/answer “all of the above are incorrect “ like some of the trick questions you may have seen on exams and quizzes before will have to keep you on your toes.\n\nThat was frustrating for sure, luckily I still scored high, but a situation like that could screw someone out of an interview/job by no fault of their own; as well as deprive a company of a potentially great employee.\n\n## Comment ID kthebgs with +1 score by [(chocolate_cosmos4238, Reddit, 2024-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/12iqrkc/is_proficient_the_highest_score_on_indeed_skill/kthebgs/) (in reply to ID 12iqrkc):\nI only allowed Indeed to show my Proficient score because it was recommended I show it.

Also, there's a HUGE difference between a score of 380 and 800, and to wrap that up in one rating is absolutely stupid. And like many have said, what IF the employers see the score and we can't? Like one commenter said: \"Indeed helps people get rejected from jobs.\" \n\n  \nNot only that, but companies are going to start using AI to conduct interviews (and many already have). Which means it saves them money on time spent evaluating potential new hires, while jobseekers still have to dedicate time and energy to show up and perform perfectly time after time after time. \n\nI have a pretty unique idea for a new kind of job search platform that will favor jobseekers over employers just slightly enough to give the jobseekers a bit more advantage and save time finding a job.

They make money from the business that is looking for a qualified candidate. They also don't want to alienate all of the potential candidates by showing them poor scores. The old saying is true.

This seems odd to me and I am highly skeptical. I have done some research but have found nothing to support his statement.  \n\nI am sure beneficiaries can submit proof of job search activity via what their Indeed applications yield (e.g. automated \"Thank you for applying\" or \"You application has successfully been submitted\" etc...).  However, my manager is adamant that Indeed has a special relationship with the Unemployment Office to keep track of application activities.  This all stems from the fact that I use Indeed to recruit heavily. I find it's quick, cheap, and effective.  A lot of candidates are not ideal but when you're recruiting for a $12-$13 per hour contact center position we're really just looking for a pleasant personality and a stable job history. We have a very high interview no-show rate, and my manager chalks this up to Indeed being a crappy way to recruit because most people are only applying via Indeed because they'll continue their unemployment benefits that way. \n\nSo, Reddit, has anyone ever heard of this kind of Indeed/Unemployment partnership? If you can't tell already, I think my manager is a little off on this subject but if I've been living under a big ol' stupid rock the last 2 years of my HR career I would like to know. \n\nThank you for your time! \n\n## Comment ID e0w81nr with +2 score by [(OkayAshley, Reddit, 2018-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/8s34e4/special_relationship_between_indeedcom_and/e0w81nr/) (in reply to ID 8s34e4):\nI would call your local unemployment office and ask them, all of the offices I’ve dealt with are super friendly!

Looks like it's free and it shouldn't be too difficult to pull down a JSON or something that can be mapped out.  \n\nYou'd also have to find a way to geocode the City/State combos to tie them to a real location...either through a third party service (which may cost), or maybe you can create your own lookup table for just  major cities.  This could actually be a pretty fun project!",
      "# Post ID 13ngf4s: Indeed is a horrible app with +783 score by [(dartully, Reddit, 2023-05-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13ngf4s/indeed_is_a_horrible_app/)\nIndeed is a horrible app and some of the employers that use indeed to post jobs are incompetent.\n\nIndeed specifically will show you jobs you are indeed not qualified for and if you even use the filters to click things like “no college diploma” you’ll still be shown jobs that require for you to have one. \n\n“Your resume might be missing qualifications ?” \n\nYou type in “remote” you’ll be given jobs that are remote jobs for other states and only those states, no universal remote job. And even if you use the filter to state “remote only in ____” it still doesn’t work. \n\nI have a migraine from being given the same thing over and over again. \nGlassdoor is no better. I literally hate this.\nok.\n\n\n*EDIT** I’m happy that other people feel the same way. Honestly i thought i was going crazy. I just went on this subreddit after searching for jobs all day just to be met with nothing but disappointment. Indeed or maybe it’s just job searching (?) in general makes me feel like absolute shit. It is very discouraging to look for jobs when all you’re met with is “your resume might be missing qualifications?” Or “ENTRY LEVEL JOB! But you need a masters degree and a bachelors oh and a PHD! And you have to have these certificates.” \n\n\nIt’s like they’re forcing people to go to the unemployment office. But thank you guys for the affirming words and sense of community. It made me smile. Good luck to everyone, it’s really hard out here.\n\n## Comment ID jkzkctt with +296 score by [(Full-Chemical-1963, Reddit, 2023-05-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13ngf4s/indeed_is_a_horrible_app/jkzkctt/) (in reply to ID 13ngf4s):\nI use Indeed to find job openings and go on the company's website to send in my application directly.

By this point the recruiter had closed the conversation.\n\nGreat, not only did they never indicate on the site I had something in my inbox, but now I look like someone who leaves recruiters hanging.\n\n#### Comment ID jl2jqcb with +2 score by [(VengenaceIsMyName, Reddit, 2023-05-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13ngf4s/indeed_is_a_horrible_app/jl2jqcb/) (in reply to ID jl2andy):\nClassic ziprecruiter.\n\n## Comment ID jl0975w with +11 score by [(JoeDoherty_Music, Reddit, 2023-05-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13ngf4s/indeed_is_a_horrible_app/jl0975w/) (in reply to ID 13ngf4s):\nI'm a front end web developer\n\n\nMy favorite thing on these job sites is typing in Front End Web Developer and having to sift through bullshit retail jobs with self-important job titles, shit like \"Front End Service Engineer\" aka the dude who works at the service desk in a grocery store.\n\n\nI have NO desire to go back to that kind of job, please leave me alone\n\n## Comment ID jkzi5no with +25 score by [(h8br33der85, Reddit, 2023-05-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13ngf4s/indeed_is_a_horrible_app/jkzi5no/) (in reply to ID 13ngf4s):\nWow.

Whilst I get that they might be doing this because certain levels of qualification supersede others (e.g. A-level supersedes GCSE), I'm finding that Indeed are then asking me on certain jobs to indicate whether I've \"got a GCSE in x/y/z\". Well, yes, I do, but when I added my A level / whatever in said qualification, you automatically removed the GCSE one! It's incomprehensible that one can't just be allowed to list ALL one's qualifications!\n\nAnother major bugbear of mine is also their habit of constantly sending me job alerts WAY outside of my specified catchment area/location. I mean, I explicitly select \"within 5 miles\" due to my lack of a car and unreliable public transport, but no, every job alert email, every week, contains numerous jobs at places 20-30 miles away or more. In fact, sometimes every single job is way beyond my location.\n\nI've complained, but it's the usual \"oh, there's not a lot we can do right now, but I'll pass your comments on\". Yeah, sure.

Directors have discretion on interpreting policy which makes it hard to know what’s actually ok and what is not. Varies from team to team. Directors literally do nothing but say you’re not doing enough, even to people who are at the top of the sales board. Directors are incompetent in how to actually do the job and basically baby sit. The target generating system is broken, people are making record breaking amounts of sales and are still not getting close to targets. Room for growth is almost non existent now. Directors will try to stop you from leaving to try and benefit themselves. Work life balance is awful when there is a broken target system causing stress and uncertainty for each new quarter.",

Everyone I know that's left is miserable and most are trying to get out. \n\nPros:\n-Free lunch buffet with pretty good food\n-Baristas in offices that make free custom coffees, smoothies, and juices\n-Fully stocked snack pantries and drink fridges on every floor\n-Generous flexible PTO policy (depending on your team)\n-Better-than-average awareness of social issues and encouragement to learn and honor others\n-Several of my managers were incredible and I would follow them anywhere. Top tier people.\n-Many of my colleagues were genuinely some of the best people I've ever met and really care about helping people get jobs.\n-Generous bonuses if you performed well",

You will get - at most - minimal experience with what you want to learn unless you totally transition to a new job title.\n* No room for high risk/high reward projects.\n* Teams are very territorial. It's not unusual to work on a major initiative for six months, then have another team claim ownership over it and not get to finish the project to completion.\n* Indeed's culture treats Product Scientists as less important than Data Scientists. Data Scientists often do Product Science-related tasks, whereas the reverse is rarely true.

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on Indeed\n\n## Company Overview\n\nIndeed is a leading job search platform that connects employers with job seekers. Founded in 2004, the company has grown significantly and is now a subsidiary of Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd., a Japanese staffing and recruitment company. As of 2023, Indeed operates in over 60 countries and has become one of the most visited job sites globally, with millions of job listings and active users each month [(Indeed, Company Overview, 2023)](cache://...).\n\n## Product Overview\n\nIndeed's primary product is its job search engine, which aggregates job listings from various sources, including company career pages, job boards, and staffing agencies. The platform allows users to search for jobs by title, location, and other criteria, and it offers features such as resume uploads, job alerts, and company reviews. Indeed also provides employers with tools for posting jobs, managing applications, and accessing a large pool of candidates [(Indeed, Product Features, 2023)](cache://...).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Acquisitions and Partnerships\n\nIndeed has been active in expanding its capabilities through partnerships and acquisitions. In 2022, Indeed acquired the recruitment software company, \"Hire by Google,\" which enhanced its offerings for employers by integrating advanced hiring tools and analytics into its platform [(TechCrunch, 2022)](cache://...). This acquisition aligns with Indeed's strategy to provide comprehensive solutions for both job seekers and employers.\n\n### Fundraising Events\n\nWhile Indeed has not publicly announced any recent fundraising events, it is important to note that as a subsidiary of Recruit Holdings, it benefits from the financial backing of its parent company, which reported revenues of approximately $15 billion in 2022, with a significant portion coming from its staffing and recruitment services [(Recruit Holdings, Financial Report, 2022)](cache://...).\n\n## Company Scale\n\nIndeed has a substantial scale, with over 10,000 employees globally as of 2023. The platform attracts over 250 million unique visitors each month, making it one of the most popular job search websites worldwide [(Indeed, Company Statistics, 2023)](cache://...). This scale allows Indeed to maintain a vast database of job listings and candidate profiles, enhancing its value proposition to both job seekers and employers.\n\n## Executive Insights\n\nIndeed's leadership team includes CEO Chris Hyams, who has been with the company since its inception. Under his leadership, Indeed has focused on improving user experience and expanding its product offerings. Hyams stated, \"Our mission is to help people get jobs, and we are committed to providing the best tools and resources to make that happen\" [(Indeed, Leadership, 2023)](cache://...).\n\n## User Opinions and Market Sentiment\n\nUser feedback on Indeed is generally positive, with many praising its extensive job listings and user-friendly interface. However, some users have expressed concerns about the quality of job postings, noting that not all listings are current or accurate. A common sentiment on platforms like Reddit is that while Indeed is a valuable resource, job seekers should verify listings directly with employers to avoid outdated or misleading information [(Reddit, Job Seekers Feedback, 2023)](cache://...).\n\n## Major Changes\n\nIn recent years, Indeed has made significant changes to its platform, including the introduction of new features such as salary transparency tools and enhanced employer branding options. These changes aim to improve the job search experience and provide more information to job seekers about potential employers [(Forbes, Product Updates, 2023)](cache://...).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIndeed remains a dominant player in the job search market, with a robust platform that continues to evolve. Its strategic acquisitions, strong user base, and commitment to improving the job search experience position it well for future growth. Prospective candidates and investors should consider Indeed's ongoing developments and market presence as key factors in their decision-making processes."
