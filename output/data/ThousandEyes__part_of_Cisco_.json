Lunch is provided daily and there are plenty facilities for team-building, including pool, ping-pong and video-games.\r\n\r\nThe platform itself is incredibly stable, and a consistent 2-week release-cycle means that bugs are fixed and features are added on a regular basis, which makes customers extremely happy.  Customer satisfaction and engagement rates are off the charts, and the live-chat support model is setting the standard for response &amp; resolution times.\r\n\r\nBest of all, this is a small company that is growing, so you are always going to be exposed to other areas of the business and have the opportunity to get involved in projects that span multiple departments.

It means a lot of OKRs, tight deadlines, shortage of people, a lot of responsibility. At least, that's how I felt;\r\n\r\n- I've met people who knew absolutely nothing about Frontend being gently \"asked\" to build UIs for months because that was the goal for the team and personal goals don't usually align with team's goals;\r\n\r\n- Full-stack teams imply that you, as a contributor, must be able both to grasp the essence of an efficient query for one database, be able to build UIs, and always be part of the on-call rotation. You also have to keep in mind that one team's area of responsibility is often very large, and there are often not that many developers. 😉\r\n\r\n- Past developers, and now \"effective\" team managers who have been with the company for a very long time, in my feeling have absolutely no idea how to help develop and help grow, but only make sure OKRs are met. Just ask a manager how he helped his IC grow in past few years and how many engineers got promotions because of his guidance. Also, ask how many developers have left his team in the past year;\r\n\r\n- In my opinion, many internal systems are still immature, which leads to a lot of constant changes &amp; annoying routine work;\r\n\r\n- Once you set everything up for work, no boring week-long training on a very complex product - you are just given a task and from that moment on you are on your own.",

The work environment is unprofessional and at sometimes, downright hostile.  The on-boarding training was sub par.  Sales numbers are declining across.   In 7 months I was asked to take on multiple roles on the team.  I was even asked to develop a sales territory via cold outbound prospecting which had no Account Executives hired to take meetings. The next career step was Corporate Sales and their manager was in the office maybe two days a week.  The SDR team is incredibly negative and sometimes personally insulting.  The new SDR manager is trying to change this, but I fear the momentum is too much.",

There are a few items we wish to highlight: 1) Many of our sales hires in Austin are new because the decision to start a customer centric hub in Austin was made just over a year ago. 2) Employees go through performance reviews and feedback. These HR conversations are confidential. 3) We are proud of the work being done by the SDR team and have invested in employee development with many examples of promotions from the SDR team to the Corporate Sales team and onwards as well as a recent change in sales model so CSR teams get the ability to partner with more experienced field sales teams. 4) The company is continuing to experience healthy growth driven by customer revenues.\r\n\r\nWe understand ThousandEyes may not be a fit for everybody. We appreciate your feedback and will continue working on creating a positive experience for everyone.\r\n\r\nDoug Cunningham\r\nManager, Enterprise Sales Development",

You also have to keep in mind that one team's area of responsibility is often very large, and there are often not that many developers. 😉\r\n\r\n- Past developers, and now \"effective\" team managers who have been with the company for a very long time, in my feeling have absolutely no idea how to help develop and help grow, but only make sure OKRs are met. Just ask a manager how he helped his IC grow in past few years and how many engineers got promotions because of his guidance. Also, ask how many developers have left his team in the past year;\r\n\r\n- In my opinion, many internal systems are still immature, which leads to a lot of constant changes &amp; annoying routine work;\r\n\r\n- Once you set everything up for work, no boring week-long training on a very complex product - you are just given a task and from that moment on you are on your own.",

      "# [Senior Software Engineer, Web Platform - ThousandEyes (part of Cisco)](https://www.builtinseattle.com/job/senior-software-engineer-web-platform/92836)\nWho We Are\n\nCisco ThousandEyes is a Digital Experience Assurance platform that empowers organizations to deliver flawless digital experiences across every network – even the ones they don’t own. Powered by AI and an unmatched set of cloud, internet and enterprise network telemetry data, ThousandEyes enables IT teams to proactively detect, diagnose, and remediate issues – before they impact end- user experiences.\n\nThousandEyes is deeply integrated across the entire Cisco technology portfolio and beyond, helping customers deploy at scale while also delivering AI-powered assurance insights within Cisco’s leading Networking, Security, Collaboration, and Observability portfolios.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nThe Web Platform team is passionate about building common abstractions that are shared by the various ThousandEyes development teams. Our mission is to evangelize standards, patterns, and best practices for software design and development at ThousandEyes. This is a frontend-leaning software development engineering role focused on platform-wide development, where you’ll work on the underpinnings of our web application to ensure that it runs smoothly for our end users and is intuitive to build for other ThousandEyes developers. We value engineers who have an excitement for learning new skills, an eagerness to venture into unknown problem spaces, and a keen ability to identify and correct problems as they encounter them. Web Platform developers maintain flexible skill sets and growth mindsets, as we’re often tagged to assist with a variety of topics within the wide-spanning layer supporting all web application architecture at ThousandEyes.\n\nLately, we’ve worked on impactful projects such as:\n\nUpgrading the version of our core frontend framework (Vue.js) across all services\n\nModernizing and setting new standards for page rendering strategy\n\nSplitting the ThousandEyes core monolith into independently deployable microfrontends\n\nMigrating and upgrading core JavaScript utilities, mitigating potential security vulnerabilities\n\nImproving application-wide UI elements such as our menus, support chat, and customer satisfaction surveys\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n\nImproving the core frontend technology that enables the ThousandEyes engineering organization to scale and keeps developers happy, including build processes and test frameworks\n\nEvangelizing modern frontend architecture and development best practices, raising the bar for frontend development at ThousandEyes through implementation, presentations, and documentation\n\nBoosting our application’s web performance, tracking core web vitals\n\nExploring new technologies that will benefit our workflow and sharing comprehensive opinions on architectural/technical decisions\n\nProviding support to other engineers on the team and throughout the engineering organization as they build upon our team’s work to achieve their goals\n\nQualifications\n\nExperience with modern frontend frameworks/libraries and knowledge of the differences between them (e.g. Vue, React, Angular, etc)\n\nExperience with Java, Golang or similar programming languages.\n\nComfortable digging deep to solve problems, prototyping solutions, and exploring new technologies and architectural patterns.\n\nAbility to advocate for frontend development best practices and improve the frontend stack across an engineering organization\n\nProven track record of identifying problems, proposing and selecting solutions, and executing them effectively\n\nComfortable collaborating, communicating, and driving change across multiple Engineering teams\n\nPassion for sharing ideas, bringing others along, caring for teammates, and attracting other great developers to join our growing organization\n\nCisco values the perspectives and skills that emerge from employees with diverse backgrounds. That's why Cisco is expanding the boundaries of discovering top talent by not only focusing on candidates with educational degrees and experience but also placing more emphasis on unlocking potential. We believe that everyone has something to offer and that diverse teams are better equipped to solve problems, innovate, and create a positive impact.\n\nWe encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification. Research shows that people from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy. We urge you not to prematurely exclude yourself and to apply if you're interested in this work.\n\nCisco is an Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, genetic information, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected basis. Cisco will consider for employment, on a case by case basis, qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.\n\nUS – COMPENSATION RANGE – MESSAGE TO APPLICANTS\n\n137,900 USD - 203,100 USD\n\nMessage to applicants applying to work in the U.S.:\n\nWhen available, the salary range posted for this position reflects the projected hiring range for new hire, full-time salaries in U.S. locations, not including equity or benefits. For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.\n\nU.S. employees have access to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings. Employees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday, plus a day off for their birthday. Employees accrue up to 20 days of Paid Time Off (PTO) each year and have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues without tapping into their PTO. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community. Employees are also able to purchase company stock through our Employee Stock Purchase Program.\n\nEmployees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco pays at the standard rate of 1% of incentive target for each 1% revenue attainment against the quota up to 100%. Once performance exceeds 100% quota attainment, incentive rates may increase up to five times the standard rate with no cap on incentive compensation. For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.",

      "# [Engineering Manager, Site Reliability Engineering (FedRAMP) - ThousandEyes (part of Cisco)](https://www.builtinseattle.com/job/engineering-manager-site-reliability-engineering-fedramp/81284)\nWho We Are\n\nThe name ThousandEyes was born from two big ideas: the power to see things not ordinarily possible and the ability to collect insights from a multitude of vantage points. As the world continues its digital transformation and relies more on cloud services and the Internet, the “network,” which is now both public and private, has become a black box our customers cannot see or understand.\n\nOur Internet and cloud intelligence platform delivers the only collectively powered real-time view of the Internet and private networks, cloud, and SaaS platforms, helping enterprises and service providers identify problems before they impact revenue, damage brand reputation, or halt employee productivity.\n\nIn August 2020, Cisco Systems completed the acquisition of ThousandEyes, which now forms the ThousandEyes Business Unit within the Cisco Networking Business Group and is the Network Assurance solution for Cisco across the Cisco Networking Cloud and Cisco Security Cloud.
