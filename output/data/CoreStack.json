      "# [Inventory](https://docs.corestack.io/docs/inventory)\nIntroduction\n\nCloud discovery and inventory management tools are a key part of being well-prepared to handle modern day cloud inventory management needs. They can help to gain full visibility of cloud resources and computer networks across an organization, in turn providing opportunities to improve customer satisfaction, decrease costs, and optimize service levels and working capital investment.\n\nBy using a connector-less model, our platform makes it easy to discover cloud services across multiple cloud providers -- and the platform's cloud resource inventory feature maintains a customer's cloud inventory items (along with category) across platforms, accounts, regions and regional groups.\n\nThese two powerful functions, along with governance-related features, can help make the CoreStack platform a core component of any multi cloud strategy.\n\nNavigating Inventory Management\n\nFollow the below steps to access different cloud inventory views in the platform:\n\nLogin to the platform, then select Resource > Inventory in the nav menu.\n\nSelect a provider in the Cloud Services filter (e.g. AWS, Azure, OCI).\n\nIn the Cloud Accounts filter, select the desired cloud account(s).\n\nSelect the relevant resource category in the Category filter\n\n(In the below example screenshots, the set category is Compute.)\n\nAfter the data is done loading, the page will display an updated list of cloud resource types under the selected category in the left section of the page, and a table view of all the resources of a selected type on the right side of the page.\n\n🚧\n\nNote:\n\nAs of version 3.8, there are two new column views available: Created Time and Changed Time.\n\nAdditional Actions for Resources\n\nTo access additional actions and view more specific details for a particular resource, click on that resource's row in the table view. The available options for that resource should appear below it.\n\nDepending on the resource, these options can include:\n\nUtilization\n\nSelect this option to view the utilization details for a cloud resource (needs to be active for at least 12 hours prior).\n\nRelationships\n\nSelect this option to view any other cloud resources related to the one selected.\n\nAudit Log\n\nSelect this option to view the activity log for a particular cloud resource.\n\nActions\n\nSelect this option to expand a list of additional inventory actions for a cloud resource:\n\nDelete: Delete an inventory action.\n\nManage Tags: Change tag key and tag value.\n\nReset: Reset an inventory action.\n\nSoft Reset: Clear entire inventory data.\n\nStart: Start tracking inventory action.\n\nView Resource Rules\n\nSelect View under the Rules column to view or download the rules for a particular cloud resource.\n\nThe rules should display the following inbound and outbound information:\n\nView Resource Tags\n\nNext, click View under Tags to view the tags for a particular resource.\n\n📘\n\nNote:\n\nTags enable you to categorize your cloud resources in several ways, such as purpose, function, owner, or environment.\n\nConsequently, when you use the cloud inventory manager in CoreStack to collect metadata from an instance, it also collects the tag information attached to that instance, making the tag information available as part of the inventory metadata of the instance.\n\nThis allows customers to filter or query inventory metadata based on the instance categorization represented by tags. For example, you can choose to query your inventory only for the instances in a production environment.\n\nAfter clicking View under Tags, the tag information for that resource should appear in a pop-up on the page.\n\nSearch an Inventory\n\nTo search information related a specific resource in your discovered cloud inventory, type the information in the search box and press Enter.",
      "# [Templates](https://docs.corestack.io/docs/templates)\nIntroduction\n\nOrchestration Templates are essentially infrastructure automation instructions written in \"YAML\" or \"JSON\" format. Templates can have multiple tasks within them, each of them performing a specific action in a target cloud or a tool. You may also have a single template to orchestrate across multiple cloud(s) and/or tool(s).\n\nCoreStack supports Templates of the formats: AWS CFN, Azure ARM, OpenStack HEAT, OpenStack MISTRAL, Terraform, Oracle, DM.\n\nOne of the key differentiators of CoreStack is its support for cloud-native DSL (Domain Specific Language) which ensures that there is no limitation in terms of the supported services within that platform.\n\nFor example, you can execute:\n\nCFN Templates against AWS\n\nARM Templates against Azure\n\nHEAT, MISTRAL, and Terraform Templates against OpenStack Public/Private Cloud Accounts\n\nYou can bring into CoreStack any of these templates with ease and re-use them outside of CoreStack if required.\n\nNavigation\n\nNavigate to Automation submenu under Operations in the Left navigation menu and select Templates option to land in Templates (Marketplace).\n\nThe tabs at the top represent the scope of the templates. You can see 2 tabs: Marketplace and My Templates.\n\nMarketplace\n\nCoreStack provides a wide range of pre-defined templates which can help in realizing multiple use cases. The marketplace lists the templates available across multiple clouds and tools. These are pre-loaded for all subscriptions and are FREE to be executed on-demand or scheduled.\n\nThese templates are available across all tenants and are usually created by the Product Administrator.\n\n📘\n\nTip:\n\nThese templates have the scope value set to Global.\n\n🚧\n\nNote:\n\nAfter the default template is added in CoreStack, there would be an approximate sync time required (which might be for of 30 minutes or more) to view the template added by you. Till then, you will see a message \"Template Synchronization is in progress. Please check back after some time.\"\n\nIn case of any discrepancies, we advise you to contact [email protected].\n\nMy Templates\n\nThese templates have been created by users within the tenant. These are available only for users within the tenant. You can add more templates or edit/delete existing templates in this tab based on your role and access policies.\n\n📘\n\nTip:\n\nThese templates have the scope value set to Tenants.\n\n🚧\n\nNote:\n\nAfter the default template is added in CoreStack, there would be an approximate sync time required (which might be for of 30 minutes or more) to view the template added by you. Till then, you will see a message \"Template Synchronization is in progress. Please check back after some time.\"\n\nIn case of any discrepancies, we advise you to contact [email protected].\n\nSearch and Filter Templates\n\nCoreStack offers search and filter functions to help quickly look for the templates you need to execute. The Search bar is available just above the templates list. To Filter Templates, you can click on the \"Filter\" icon placed to the right end above the templates list.\n\nThe Text Search helps you search using any string available in the following fields:\n\nName of the Template\n\nDescription of the Template\n\nType\n\nDSL\n\nClassification\n\nService\n\nThe text search is thus quite useful in refining your search results based on any little information you have on the preferred result set.\n\nCoreStack also offers Filters to help you narrow down the list of templates by using one or a combination of filters. On clicking the Filter icon, you will see the list of Filter options available as shown below. Select the preferred options and click on \"Apply Filter\" button at the bottom of this box.\n\n📘\n\nTip:\n\nUse the Reset button to quickly remove all selected filters and view all results.\n\nOnce you decide on a template that you would like to try out, you can execute it on-demand or schedule it for a one-time or recurring execution(s) in future.\n\nView Template Details\n\nTo get more information about a specific template, click on the template to open the 'Template Detail' page. You can view the attributes related to the template and update the values if required by clicking on Update.\n\nThe actual content of the template, which is in 'YAML' or 'JSON' format is also displayed. Click 'Edit' button and make changes to the content if required.\n\nTemplate Actions\n\nTemplate actions will be shown to every template listed when you are hovering mouse on a template. The list of actions depends on the scope of the template (Marketplace, My Templates) and the RBAC access for templates that user has.\n\nExecute – Executes the template immediately and redirects to \"Job history\" where you can see the status and output of the execution.\n\nEdit– Modifies the properties, content, metadata of the Template. It's like Template Create workflow.\n\nSchedules – Similar to Execute, but schedules it to be run later once/multiple times.\n\nDelete – Deletes the template\n\nExecute Template\n\nExecutes the template against Cloud Accounts and performs the tasks specified in the template. In 'Job History' you can find the status and outputs for this execution. Execute requires following inputs:\n\nJob Name – Optional. If not given system will generates this.\n\nCloud Account – Cloud Account need to be used for execution.\n\nCloud Account Additional Info – Additional Info of Cloud Account (E.g., Resource Group, Location, Region).\n\nExecution Parameters – Additional parameters from the Template.\n\nA sample Template execute window, for a simple example of taking an \"AWS_EC2_Instance_With_SecurityGroup\" is shown below:\n\nThe Cloud Accounts lists the available list of AWS cloud accounts in this Tenant.\n\nOnce the Cloud Account details are selected, click on \"Load Execute parameters\" to get the input parameters of the template.\n\nYou can enter/select values from dropdown for input params based on need and hit \"Run\" to execute the template.\n\nOnce a template is executed, it is run as a \"Job\" within CoreStack. You can check the execution logs and job status from the \"Job History\" tab.\n\n📘\n\nTips:\n\nMost of the input parameter values are fetched automatically from the respective cloud account. This is very useful in choosing real-time values from the cloud. There is no need to login to the AWS Console to refer these details.\n\nYou can use the \"?\" on the right side of each input parameter to understand more about the parameter.\n\nTerraform Templates\n\nIn addition to being able to execute and manage orchestration templates from a base of pre-existing templates, users can also execute Terraform templates in the platform from a GitHub Enterprise code repository via an integration.\n\nWith this feature, users can store their Terraform code in a GitHub Enterprise repository and then configure a pipeline that automatically pulls the code and executes it. This enables teams to collaborate on infrastructure configuration and allows for easy version control and auditing of changes.\n\n📘\n\nCI/CD Config File Management\n\nAutomation available through the platform now provides the opportunity to edit/manage the saved CI/CD config files on the GitHub deployment repo for provisioned resources. Users will be able to perform an edit and save the changes in the config management of provisioned resources.\n\nAfter a user edits and saves these pre-existing CI/CD configuration files on the deployment repo for the provisioned resources through the platform, the existing Azure DevOps/ADO pipeline will detect the changes to these CI/CD config files and trigger the pipeline execution. This in turn will update the configuration setting of the resource on the target account.\n\nEnable Access to your GitHub Repository\n\nUsers can authorize GitHub repository access with a personal access token, which will enable them to clone and run Terraform templates stored in GitHub through the platform.\n\nTo do this, start by clicking the plus icon (+) on the Automation > Templates > My templates page to open the Create Template menu.\n\nAfter users provide all the necessary details in the Template Property section, they can select the Git option under the Template Content section.\n\nAt this point, users can upload individual or multiple Terraform folders through a .zip file through the import feature.\n\nUsers can choose the optional values from Terraform and leave them as optional in the platform during template execution without them being mandated.\n\nViewing Terraform Template Content\n\nAfter a template is imported or created under the Terraform category, users can view it by selecting it from the available templates, then selecting the content tab. This will show the Terraform template content with proper coding alignment in order to help interpret the code.\n\nView and Download .tfstate file for Executed Terraform Templates\n\nDuring the execution of a Terraform template, users will be able to view the .tfstate file created as part of the execution.\n\nThis is shown as a card under the Job History tab. Select that tab and then select the Terraform State tab for any executed Terraform templates along the right side to view the code contents of the file. This file can also be downloadable for reference by clicking the download icon.\n\n📘\n\nNote:\n\nUpload JSON Support: The platform now provides the ability to upload Terraform templates through JSON.\n\nUsers can choose either .json or .tf format to save and commit their Terraform template parameters.\n\nDownload Job Result: The platform now supports the download of executed Terraform job logs.\n\nDeleting and Rolling Back Templates that Failed to Execute\n\nUsers can use the ‘delete’ option when a particular template fails to execute, which will act as a rollback to remove all the changes made and bring it back to its original state, so that it can be re-run later.\n\nUsers can access this option under the Job History tab by selecting the delete icon from the available action buttons along the top of the page.\n\nSchedule Template\n\nThis schedules the template execution to be run later once or multiple times. For example, you can schedule backup for an Instance daily. The schedule requires the following details:\n\nName – Name of the schedule.\n\nDescription – Detailed description about the schedule.\n\nSchedule Settings – Execution options. Template can be scheduled to execute Once or to repeat after specified Minutes, Hours, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly.\n\nCloud Account – Cloud Account need to be used for execution.\n\nCloud Account Additional Info – Additional Info of Cloud Account (e.g. Resource Group, Location, Region).\n\nExecution Parameters – Additional parameters from the Template.\n\nAn example screenshot of scheduling a template is shown below:\n\nThe list of schedules created for that specific tenant can be viewed from the Schedules tab.\n\nCreate (Upload) Custom Templates\n\nCoreStack also provides the option for users to upload their own templates and use them to execute against their service accounts. Follow the steps given below: Use the '+' button next to the 'Search' bar at top right.\n\nTemplate create window will have 3 sections as follows: Properties, Content, and Metadata.\n\nJob History\n\nLists all template executions of the current tenant. A sample screenshot is shown below. The tabs at the top right represents the archive status of jobs. You can see 2 tabs: Active Jobs and Archived Jobs.\n\nThe Template Job History page offers search and filter functions to help quickly look for the executions. The Search bar is available just above the jobs list. To Filter Jobs, you can click on the \"Filter\" icon placed to the right end above the Job detail tab.\n\nTemplate Job History page also has Archive, Un-Archive and Delete Actions. These actions can be used to have limited number of executions in Job history page.\n\nJob history page has option to refresh the Jobs list. This will help when you are landing here from template execute page. By the time you are landing the Job might be IN_PROGRESS state. This will help to refresh the status.\n\nTemplate Jobs list show the following columns in the list.\n\nTemplate Name – Name of the Template executed.\n\nJob Name – Name of the Job which is generated by the CoreStack with Template name and some random characters.\n\nCloud Accounts – Name of the Cloud Account selected when executing.\n\nRun Date – Date & Time of the Job execution.\n\nType – Execution Type (On-Demand, Scheduled, or System).\n\nStatus – Status of the Job execution.\n\nActions – Actions will be available for CloudFormation and HEAT templates. In CloudFormation and HEAT each template execution considered as stack, which supports the update and delete actions. Update action used to update the attributes of the resources where Delete action removed all the resources created by that execution.\n\nTemplate Job Detail will be shown on clicking Job from the list. This will show three tabs. Inputs, Output, and Task.\n\nInputs – Cloud Account details and input parameters passed for the execution.\n\nOutput – Outputs from the template execution.\n\nTask – List of tasks or resources executed in this template.\n\nSchedules\n\nLists all template execution schedules of the current tenant. The tabs at the top right represents the schedule status. You can see 2 tabs: Upcoming and Past. Upcoming will list the schedules which are active, to be execute on future based on its scheduled time. Past will list the schedules which are no longer going to be executed. For example, Scheduled Once will be moved to the Past tab after its execution.\n\nA sample screenshot is shown below:\n\nThe Template Schedules page offers search and filter functions to help quickly look for the schedules. The Search bar is available just above the schedules list. To Filter Jobs, you can click on the \"Filter\" icon placed to the right end above the Schedule detail tab.\n\nTemplate Schedules list show the following columns in the list:\n\nSchedule Name – Name of the schedule.\n\nTemplate – Name of the Template Scheduled.\n\nRecurrence – Recurrence of the Schedule (Once/ Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Yearly).\n\nNext Run Time – Date and Time of the Next execution.\n\nRequested By – CoreStack username who created the schedule.\n\nTemplate Schedule Detail will be shown on clicking Schedule from the list. This will show the execution history the schedule which will redirect to Job history page and filter by this schedule. It's also supports the following actions on schedule.\n\nEdit (All Occurrences) – Modifies the Schedule like Schedule Create.\n\nDelete (All Occurrences) – Deletes the Schedules.\n\nCoreStack also provides control over the next execution of the schedule. You can remove the next execution or can edit the next execution time alone without modifying the schedule.\n\nFor example, in a daily 12pm schedule, you can change the time of the next execution.",

It will give you line by line every single type of api call, instance, storage etc for every service for every region broken down to the hour for each individual resource.\nAnd it is 100% complete compared to any other solution. Which often miss new services or costs which aren't tied to specific resources and so won't be visible via an api call enumeration.\nYou can get it in CSV or Parquet.\nAthena can be useful for querying it.\n\n## Comment ID hi6m380 with +12 score by [(moduspwnens14, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi6m380/) (in reply to ID qgj1gd):\nIt's not graphical, but [AWS Recon](https://github.com/darkbitio/aws-recon) does this.\n\n### Comment ID hi71go6 with +2 score by [(SmasherOfAjumma, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi71go6/) (in reply to ID hi6m380):\nGoing to check this out.

I'm fortunate enough to see a variety of clients from different countries and industry verticals. Although a tool can be valuable in the short term, my 2 cents from what I'm seeing out in the wild.....\n\nHistorically, native cost management tools from cloud vendors offered limited value, forcing organizations to adopt third-party tools for cost optimization, typically paying a percentage of cloud spend. While they initially delivered significant savings by addressing inefficiencies, their value diminished as organizations struggled to justify costs. In response, cloud vendors improved their native tools, closing the gap and prompting a return to these no-cost options. Third-party tools still provide value in specific scenarios, but their overall value proposition is being re-assessed.\n\nIn short, they're expensive, initially they're seen as valuable when an estate that hasn't been maintained suddenly has a dip in spend. Over time the reduction in costs slows down and they're seen as an expensive waste. I'm seeing a lot of organisations shift back to native tooling...\n\nThat aside, Turbonomics, Cloud Health, Cloud Ability are all decent. And they have their place. If you're tech savvy enough, even creating a data export into an S3 bucket, crawler to surface the data in Athena, query using TSQL and visualise in Grafana/PBI etc is a possibility..... there are many options.\n\n### Comment ID mbaunsd with +2 score by [(Therlane, Reddit, 2025-02-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinOps/comments/1iikpqj/what_are_the_best_finops_tools_for_managing_and/mbaunsd/) (in reply to ID mb8pzgn):\nUsed CloudHealth and Flexera.  \nOnboard tools are good enough.  \nIf you're using AWS, they even have their CUDOS-Dashboards which put a lot of the data into their cheap BI-Tool.  \nI'm sure Azure has the same with PowerBI.  \nImagine just alone to be able to push the savings recommendations to the app owners, and then they can implement, snooze, reject them in PowerBI.... how cool would that be.\n\n#### Comment ID mbb22gm with +1 score by [(Total-Law4620, Reddit, 2025-02-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinOps/comments/1iikpqj/what_are_the_best_finops_tools_for_managing_and/mbb22gm/) (in reply to ID mbaunsd):\nYeah Azure has similar\n\n### Comment ID mb916uz with +1 score by [(Pope_Carl_the_69th, Reddit, 2025-02-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinOps/comments/1iikpqj/what_are_the_best_finops_tools_for_managing_and/mb916uz/) (in reply to ID mb8pzgn):\nYeah this is basically my main concern.\n\nInitial year savings may be huge but once the low hanging fruit is plucked, how can a company justify keeping the software around if it’s costing so much?\n\n#### Comment ID mb944vi with +4 score by [(Total-Law4620, Reddit, 2025-02-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinOps/comments/1iikpqj/what_are_the_best_finops_tools_for_managing_and/mb944vi/) (in reply to ID mb916uz):\nOften it's that a company doesn't keep track of their wins or where they would have been if they hadn't implemented xyz.... \n\nBut also show back, charge back, visualising your billing data.

Trust me, I’ve explored so many options, trying to find something that fits our budget. Also, one of the main concerns for me was I should be able to see how much each team or department is spending in a significantly simpler form and apart from that I needeed a heads up when we are overdoing the budget and some basic automation that can help.  \nTo my surprise I found this in a tool - Turbo360, a bit under rated I must say. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting it to offer these features at a significantly lower cost than other tools in the market. But the only thing is it focuses solely only on Azure (though I heard they might expand to AWS in the future).  \nIt helped me to get straightforward insights on costs and show us the Azure spend department wise, we can set alerts if we are crossing the budget - set up alerts when we’re nearing budget limits (for example, at 80%), And it also helps you in automating few tasks like shut down unused resources and resize VMs which has saved time and reduced waste. They also have a price re-rating feature which obviously is much important for an MSP. It’s obviously not a magic fix, but it’s made cost management easier and more proactive. If you’re working with Azure and want better cost control, it’s worth checking out -[https://turbo360.com/solutions/finops](https://turbo360.com/solutions/finops) \n\nBut personally imo FinOps still needs human oversight and strategic decision.\n\n## Comment ID mcitkj8 with +1 score by [(Pouilly-Fume, Reddit, 2025-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinOps/comments/1iikpqj/what_are_the_best_finops_tools_for_managing_and/mcitkj8/) (in reply to ID 1iikpqj):\nCheck out hyperglance.com, also comes with out of the box Azure Gov support and is self hosted so is a dream security-wise.\n\n## Comment ID merr9wm with +1 score by [(Happy-Huckleberry-73, Reddit, 2025-02-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinOps/comments/1iikpqj/what_are_the_best_finops_tools_for_managing_and/merr9wm/) (in reply to ID 1iikpqj):\n[https://ternary.app/](https://ternary.app/)\n\n## Comment ID mb6fiwa with +2 score by [(yo_jessy_pinkman, Reddit, 2025-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinOps/comments/1iikpqj/what_are_the_best_finops_tools_for_managing_and/mb6fiwa/) (in reply to ID 1iikpqj):\nFlexera is probably the best but it is expensive.

CR360 provides new levels of visibility and insight without requiring multiple tools or cumbersome integrations. It adapts quickly as technology evolves and as cloud providers introduce new functionality, future-proofing cloud operations whether you run AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI, or all of the above.\n\nWith CR360, you get a 360-degree view of each cloud resource – a comprehensive perspective that includes anything and everything associated with a given resource. We associate the cloud resource with relevant workloads, dependencies, projects, and much more, providing a complete view of each cloud resource by applying different lenses to the data.\n\nThis approach allows a single platform to provide a unified experience that supports multiple disparate capabilities, including FinOps, SecOps, CloudOps, architecture assessments, and whatever comes next.\n\nAI can be a powerful ally, and having a solid foundation of cloud governance will enable you to embrace AI with greater confidence. The stronger your cloud governance model, the more likely you’ll be able to harness the unique capabilities of AI and apply them to solve complex business problems.\n\nWith CR360 as a foundation, we can continue with the next evolution of cloud governance by introducing machine-based intelligence. The key to maximizing the value of AI is what we call AI-on-AI or AI2. Because GenAI understands language, output from one AI can be fed to another AI to enhance, transform, or interpret business problems and agendas.\n\nCoreStack’s AI agents, or co-pilots, are designed to take advantage of this feature. By enabling AI systems to interact and learn from each other, we unlock new levels of automation, insight, and adaptability that were previously unthinkable.",
