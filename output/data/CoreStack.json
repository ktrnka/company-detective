      "# [Inventory](https://docs.corestack.io/docs/inventory)\nIntroduction\n\nCloud discovery and inventory management tools are a key part of being well-prepared to handle modern day cloud inventory management needs. They can help to gain full visibility of cloud resources and computer networks across an organization, in turn providing opportunities to improve customer satisfaction, decrease costs, and optimize service levels and working capital investment.\n\nBy using a connector-less model, CoreStack makes it easy to discover cloud services across multiple cloud providers -- and CoreStack’s cloud resource inventory feature maintains a customer's cloud inventory items (along with category) across platforms, accounts, regions and regional groups.\n\nThese two powerful functions, along with governance-related features, can help make the CoreStack platform a core component of any multi cloud strategy.\n\nNavigating Inventory Management\n\nFollow the below steps to access different cloud inventory views in CoreStack:\n\nLogin to CoreStack, then select Resource > Inventory in the nav menu.\n\nSelect a provider in the Cloud Services filter (e.g. AWS, Azure, OCI).\n\nIn the Cloud Accounts filter, select the desired cloud account(s).\n\nSelect the relevant resource category in the Category filter\n\n(In the below example screenshots, the set category is Compute.)\n\nAfter the data is done loading, the page will display an updated list of cloud resource types under the selected category in the left section of the page, and a table view of all the resources of a selected type on the right side of the page.\n\n🚧\n\nNote:\n\nAs of version 3.8, there are two new column views available: Created Time and Changed Time.\n\nAdditional Actions for Resources\n\nTo access additional actions and view more specific details for a particular resource, click on that resource's row in the table view. The available options for that resource should appear below it.\n\nDepending on the resource, these options can include:\n\nUtilization\n\nSelect this option to view the utilization details for a cloud resource (needs to be active for at least 12 hours prior).\n\nRelationships\n\nSelect this option to view any other cloud resources related to the one selected.\n\nAudit Log\n\nSelect this option to view the activity log for a particular cloud resource.\n\nActions\n\nSelect this option to expand a list of additional inventory actions for a cloud resource:\n\nDelete: Delete an inventory action.\n\nManage Tags: Change tag key and tag value.\n\nReset: Reset an inventory action.\n\nSoft Reset: Clear entire inventory data.\n\nStart: Start tracking inventory action.\n\nView Resource Rules\n\nSelect View under the Rules column to view or download the rules for a particular cloud resource.\n\nThe rules should display the following inbound and outbound information:\n\nView Resource Tags\n\nNext, click View under Tags to view the tags for a particular resource.\n\n📘\n\nNote:\n\nTags enable you to categorize your cloud resources in several ways, such as purpose, function, owner, or environment.\n\nConsequently, when you use the cloud inventory manager in CoreStack to collect metadata from an instance, it also collects the tag information attached to that instance, making the tag information available as part of the inventory metadata of the instance.\n\nThis allows customers to filter or query inventory metadata based on the instance categorization represented by tags. For example, you can choose to query your inventory only for the instances in a production environment.\n\nAfter clicking View under Tags, the tag information for that resource should appear in a pop-up on the page.\n\nSearch an Inventory\n\nTo search information related a specific resource in your discovered cloud inventory, type the information in the search box and press Enter."

It will give you line by line every single type of api call, instance, storage etc for every service for every region broken down to the hour for each individual resource.\nAnd it is 100% complete compared to any other solution. Which often miss new services or costs which aren't tied to specific resources and so won't be visible via an api call enumeration.\nYou can get it in CSV or Parquet.\nAthena can be useful for querying it.\n\n## Comment ID hi6m380 with +13 score by [(moduspwnens14, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi6m380/) (in reply to ID qgj1gd):\nIt's not graphical, but [AWS Recon](https://github.com/darkbitio/aws-recon) does this.\n\n### Comment ID hi71go6 with +3 score by [(SmasherOfAjumma, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi71go6/) (in reply to ID hi6m380):\nGoing to check this out.

AWS Resource Groups: Tag Editor: All regions, All supported resource types and leave tag fields blank. This will show you everything you have.  \n\n[https://console.aws.amazon.com/resource-groups/tag-editor/find-resources?region=us-east-1#query=regions:!%28%27AWS::AllSupported%27%29,resourceTypes:!%28%27AWS::AllSupported%27%29,tagFilters:!%28%29,type:TAG\\_EDITOR\\_1\\_0](https://console.aws.amazon.com/resource-groups/tag-editor/find-resources?region=us-east-1#query=regions:!%28%27AWS::AllSupported%27%29,resourceTypes:!%28%27AWS::AllSupported%27%29,tagFilters:!%28%29,type:TAG_EDITOR_1_0)\n\nIf you want to run this as a CLI and output a list of ARNs by region:\n\n$ for REGION in $(aws ec2 describe-regions --region us-east-1 --query \"Regions\\[\\].{Name:RegionName}\" --output text); do  \necho $REGION;  \naws resourcegroupstaggingapi get-resources --region $REGION --output text \\\\  \n\\--query 'ResourceTagMappingList\\[\\*\\].\\[ResourceARN\\]'; done\n\nThese aren't the \"dashboard\" you're looking for, but they should get the job done. You could even go through and tag items with a Key of \"cost\" and value \"free\" to know what to exclude - because that resource is free.\n\n### Comment ID hi7b093 with +1 score by [(2nealalan, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi7b093/) (in reply to ID hi7agp8):\nOh yea, to run the CLI easily incase you're not on a Mac or Linux machine with the AWS CLI and can run that command...\n\nYou can use CloudShell (free):  \n[https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home?region=us-east-1#](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home?region=us-east-1#)\n\nDrop that shell command in w/out the leading dollar sign and you should have a nice list that you can scroll through or redirect to a file to download.\n\n## Comment ID hi6s8e1 with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi6s8e1/) (in reply to ID qgj1gd):\n[EC2 Global View](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/09/amazon-ec2-global-view-console-regions/). It's not fast, but it works. You can also resort to looking at your MTD (month to date) bills and breaking down by region. It doesn't yet support the full gamut of resources, but it will catch the most likely to give you bill shock.\n \nYou can also use SCPs to block the creation of resources outside regions you want to support.\n\n### Comment ID hi7rfds with +7 score by [(BooglesFoogles, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi7rfds/) (in reply to ID hi6s8e1):\nOP's question specifically asks for \"every resource\" whereas EC2 Global View is....just for EC2.\n\n#### Comment ID hi7uunl with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi7uunl/) (in reply to ID hi7rfds):\nAs I said, OP can also resort to the MTD view in the Billing Dashboard. It will show accrued usage even within the free tier (as the free tier is applied as a bill credit). OP should also consider the use of SCPs to outright block the creation of resources outside of those they intend to use in regions they intend to support.\n\n### Comment ID hi77o2v with +1 score by [(SharkbaitOoHaaHaa, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi77o2v/) (in reply to ID hi6s8e1):\nIMO this is the best answer, you're not using every region/service in AWS and so you may as well just block them explicitly, also saves the problem of \"oops wrong region\"\n\n#### Comment ID hi7c7m5 with +1 score by [(2nealalan, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi7c7m5/) (in reply to ID hi77o2v):\nIf I'm not mistaken, you can't explicitly block regions that are available, unless they were a region you manually enabled? \n\nSince this is the case, the user would want to have visibility to every possible region to ensure no one created resources in a region where they shouldn't have. (Accidentally or intentionally, \\*cough\\* crypto miner.)\n\n## Comment ID hi6no16 with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi6no16/) (in reply to ID qgj1gd):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID hi6s931 with +14 score by [(Vantage_Team, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi6s931/) (in reply to ID hi6no16):\nThanks for posting this! We're the team behind Vantage. To add to this, Vantage offers two features that help customers here:\n\n- Resource inventory: Gives you a full inventory of everything in your account. https://www.vantage.sh/features/resource-inventory\n\n- Advanced analytics: The ability to see day-by-day accrued costs on a per-resource basis for each active resource.  https://www.vantage.sh/features/advanced-analytics\n\nCost Explorer does not give a per-resource level of analysis outside of EC2. Vantage combines Cost and Usage Report (CUR) data and syncs periodically with service List/Describe API calls to be able to show this level of analytics for \"active\" resources.\n\n#### Comment ID hi6wb0k with +2 score by [(thectrain, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi6wb0k/) (in reply to ID hi6s931):\nThis might sound cheap.

      "# [The CoreStack Platform on 2024-07-04](https://www.corestack.io/solutions/platform/)\nThe heart of the CoreStack platform is CR360™ (Cloud Resource 360) – the single system of intelligence for all your cloud resources. CR360 provides new levels of visibility and insight without requiring multiple tools or cumbersome integrations. It adapts quickly as technology evolves and as cloud providers introduce new functionality, future-proofing cloud operations whether you run AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI, or all of the above.\n\nWith CR360, you get a 360-degree view of each cloud resource – a comprehensive perspective that includes anything and everything associated with a given resource. We associate the cloud resource with relevant workloads, dependencies, projects, and much more, providing a complete view of each cloud resource by applying different lenses to the data.\n\nThis approach allows a single platform to provide a unified experience that supports multiple disparate capabilities, including FinOps, SecOps, CloudOps, architecture assessments, and whatever comes next.\n\nAI can be a powerful ally, and having a solid foundation of cloud governance will enable you to embrace AI with greater confidence. The stronger your cloud governance model, the more likely you’ll be able to harness the unique capabilities of AI and apply them to solve complex business problems.\n\nWith CR360 as a foundation, we can continue with the next evolution of cloud governance by introducing machine-based intelligence. The key to maximizing the value of AI is what we call AI-on-AI or AI2. Because GenAI understands language, output from one AI can be fed to another AI to enhance, transform, or interpret business problems and agendas.\n\nCoreStack’s AI agents, or co-pilots, are designed to take advantage of this feature. By enabling AI systems to interact and learn from each other, we unlock new levels of automation, insight, and adaptability that were previously unthinkable.",
