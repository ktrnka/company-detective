      "# [Templates](https://docs.corestack.io/docs/templates)\nIntroduction\n\nOrchestration Templates are essentially infrastructure automation instructions written in \"YAML\" or \"JSON\" format. Templates can have multiple tasks within them, each of them performing a specific action in a target cloud or a tool. You may also have a single template to orchestrate across multiple cloud(s) and/or tool(s).\n\nCoreStack supports Templates of the formats: AWS CFN, Azure ARM, OpenStack HEAT, OpenStack MISTRAL, Terraform, Oracle, DM.\n\nOne of the key differentiators of CoreStack is its support for cloud-native DSL (Domain Specific Language) which ensures that there is no limitation in terms of the supported services within that platform.\n\nFor example, you can execute:\n\nCFN Templates against AWS\n\nARM Templates against Azure\n\nHEAT, MISTRAL, and Terraform Templates against OpenStack Public/Private Cloud Accounts\n\nYou can bring into CoreStack any of these templates with ease and re-use them outside of CoreStack if required.\n\nNavigation\n\nNavigate to Automation submenu under Operations in the Left navigation menu and select Templates option to land in Templates (Marketplace).\n\nThe tabs at the top represent the scope of the templates. You can see 2 tabs: Marketplace and My Templates.\n\nMarketplace\n\nCoreStack provides a wide range of pre-defined templates which can help in realizing multiple use cases. The marketplace lists the templates available across multiple clouds and tools. These are pre-loaded for all subscriptions and are FREE to be executed on-demand or scheduled.\n\nThese templates are available across all tenants and are usually created by the Product Administrator.\n\n📘\n\nTip:\n\nThese templates have the scope value set to Global.\n\n🚧\n\nNote:\n\nAfter the default template is added in CoreStack, there would be an approximate sync time required (which might be for of 30 minutes or more) to view the template added by you. Till then, you will see a message \"Template Synchronization is in progress. Please check back after some time.\"\n\nIn case of any discrepancies, we advise you to contact [email protected].\n\nMy Templates\n\nThese templates have been created by users within the tenant. These are available only for users within the tenant. You can add more templates or edit/delete existing templates in this tab based on your role and access policies.\n\n📘\n\nTip:\n\nThese templates have the scope value set to Tenants.\n\n🚧\n\nNote:\n\nAfter the default template is added in CoreStack, there would be an approximate sync time required (which might be for of 30 minutes or more) to view the template added by you. Till then, you will see a message \"Template Synchronization is in progress. Please check back after some time.\"\n\nIn case of any discrepancies, we advise you to contact [email protected].\n\nSearch and Filter Templates\n\nCoreStack offers search and filter functions to help quickly look for the templates you need to execute. The Search bar is available just above the templates list. To Filter Templates, you can click on the \"Filter\" icon placed to the right end above the templates list.\n\nThe Text Search helps you search using any string available in the following fields:\n\nName of the Template\n\nDescription of the Template\n\nType\n\nDSL\n\nClassification\n\nService\n\nThe text search is thus quite useful in refining your search results based on any little information you have on the preferred result set.\n\nCoreStack also offers Filters to help you narrow down the list of templates by using one or a combination of filters. On clicking the Filter icon, you will see the list of Filter options available as shown below. Select the preferred options and click on \"Apply Filter\" button at the bottom of this box.\n\n📘\n\nTip:\n\nUse the Reset button to quickly remove all selected filters and view all results.\n\nOnce you decide on a template that you would like to try out, you can execute it on-demand or schedule it for a one-time or recurring execution(s) in future.\n\nView Template Details\n\nTo get more information about a specific template, click on the template to open the 'Template Detail' page. You can view the attributes related to the template and update the values if required by clicking on Update.\n\nThe actual content of the template, which is in 'YAML' or 'JSON' format is also displayed. Click 'Edit' button and make changes to the content if required.\n\nTemplate Actions\n\nTemplate actions will be shown to every template listed when you are hovering mouse on a template. The list of actions depends on the scope of the template (Marketplace, My Templates) and the RBAC access for templates that user has.\n\nExecute – Executes the template immediately and redirects to \"Job history\" where you can see the status and output of the execution.\n\nEdit– Modifies the properties, content, metadata of the Template. It's like Template Create workflow.\n\nSchedules – Similar to Execute, but schedules it to be run later once/multiple times.\n\nDelete – Deletes the template\n\nExecute Template\n\nExecutes the template against Cloud Accounts and performs the tasks specified in the template. In 'Job History' you can find the status and outputs for this execution. Execute requires following inputs:\n\nJob Name – Optional. If not given system will generates this.\n\nCloud Account – Cloud Account need to be used for execution.\n\nCloud Account Additional Info – Additional Info of Cloud Account (E.g., Resource Group, Location, Region).\n\nExecution Parameters – Additional parameters from the Template.\n\nA sample Template execute window, for a simple example of taking an \"AWS_EC2_Instance_With_SecurityGroup\" is shown below:\n\nThe Cloud Accounts lists the available list of AWS cloud accounts in this Tenant.\n\nOnce the Cloud Account details are selected, click on \"Load Execute parameters\" to get the input parameters of the template.\n\nYou can enter/select values from dropdown for input params based on need and hit \"Run\" to execute the template.\n\nOnce a template is executed, it is run as a \"Job\" within CoreStack. You can check the execution logs and job status from the \"Job History\" tab.\n\n📘\n\nTips:\n\nMost of the input parameter values are fetched automatically from the respective cloud account. This is very useful in choosing real-time values from the cloud. There is no need to login to the AWS Console to refer these details.\n\nYou can use the \"?\" on the right side of each input parameter to understand more about the parameter.\n\nTerraform Templates\n\nIn addition to being able to execute and manage orchestration templates from a base of pre-existing templates, users can also execute Terraform templates in the platform from a GitHub Enterprise code repository via an integration.\n\nWith this feature, users can store their Terraform code in a GitHub Enterprise repository and then configure a pipeline that automatically pulls the code and executes it.

      "# [Budget](https://docs.corestack.io/docs/budget)\nIntroduction to Budget Management\n\nCloud cost contributes a big portion of the expenses incurred by enterprises. It is important to control these expenses by regularly monitoring the cost incurred by different departments in an enterprise.\n\nMany organizations use different budgeting mechanisms for managing and planning their cloud spend for different teams/departments to run a predictable business.\n\nIn comparison to traditional on-premises budgeting, cloud budget management is much more complex due to the variable costs involved with multiple cloud services. Multi-cloud environment makes it even more complex.\n\nThe key factor involved in budget planning and forecasting is to remove the surprise factor from the cloud billing and allocate/distribute money efficiently. The bigger opportunity with budget planning and forecasting is about how to effectively use cloud and improve the financial and business predictability.\n\nCloud budget management consists of four components:\n\nForecast: The variable nature of cloud costs, enables you to cut down waste. But at the same time, it requires an efficient forecasting model that can analyze, not only the historical billing data but also derive patterns from these data. Similarly, forecasting is needed for an effective cloud usage and reserved instance planning.\n\nMonitor: The ability to set budgets and monitor them periodically at multiple levels.\n\nReport: The actual or forecasted data must be continuously reported and provided to all stakeholders on a periodic basis.\n\nRespond: When budgets are at risk, automated responses and actions must be available. It will provide flexibility to respond at various budget thresholds.\n\nCoreStack Budget Management\n\nCoreStack Budget Management provides flexibility and support for budget forecasting and planning needs of organizations of all sizes and cost centers that span one or more public cloud providers.\n\nCoreStack enables you to define budgets for various departments and control the expenses on cloud within budget. This feature also provides insights in real-time about the budgets configured as the cloud spend constantly changes.\n\nNavigation\n\nTo open Budget Management dashboard, in the left navigation menu, click Cost and select the Budget option.\n\nYou can view the budget rules summary in the Budget Management dashboard. It includes the budget rules created to monitor and control the cloud accounts cost. It also provides the number of budget rules configured and the total number of alerts triggered by the budget rules.\n\nFilters\n\nThe Budget Management dashboard includes following filters to refine and view the budget details.\n\nCloud Provider: Filters the budget details by cloud providers.\n\nCloud Account: Filters the budget details by cloud accounts.\n\nCurrency: Displays the values in the selected currency.\n\nCloud Account Type: Filters the budget details by cloud account type.\n\nAdvanced Filters: Filters the budget details using advanced options. For example, budget period, budget amount, actual spend, and forecasted spend.\n\nDownload Budget Details\n\nTo download configured budgets information displayed in the Budget Management dashboard as .CSV or .PDF file, click Download icon.\n\nRecent Alerts and Insights\n\nThe Recent Alerts & Insights section includes details about the most recent alerts triggered by the budget rules configured in the account and the key insights that were derived as part of budget management operations.\n\nTo open Alerts & Insights, click View All.\n\nAlerts\n\nThis tab lists budget rule triggered alerts.\n\nInsights\n\nThis tab lists budget rule details. It provides log of all actions performed with respect to triggered thresholds.\n\nSync with Cloud\n\nYou can import budgets created in public cloud account to CoreStack. When a cloud account is onboarded into CoreStack, all budgets created in the cloud account are imported automatically and listed in the Budget Management dashboard.\n\nOnce a cloud account is onboarded, CoreStack periodically synchronize the budgets from cloud native experience every 24 hours. You can also synchronize budgets created in cloud provider account on demand.\n\nClick arrow button in the Budget Management dashboard and select Sync with Cloud. It will sync cloud account and export budget details into CoreStack.\n\n📘\n\nOne-way budget sync\n\nPlease note that budget sync from cloud provider accounts is only one-way. Currently, any budgets created in CoreStack portal are not synced to your cloud provider experience.\n\nDashboard Views\n\nCoreStack provides multiple views for the Budget Management dashboard. You can save the preferred view and preserve settings. For example, the selected filters for respective logins.\n\nDifferences in Cost Data Between Budget and Cost Posture Pages\n\n📘\n\nNote:\n\nUsers may notice some discrepancies in the spend history data when creating a new budget rule and the overall cost data shown on the Cost Posture page. This is due to some differences in how cost data is added up based on the cloud account type and page view.\n\nThese differences are explained in more detail below.\n\nPosture Page:\n\nAWS:\n\nThe Account View shows the cost amount associated with a management account excluding the costs associated with any member account(s) (member account costs are shown individually).\n\nThe Tenant View shows the cost amount(s) associated with onboarded member accounts along with the amount(s) associated with the management account.\n\nIf the Cost Report Access field is set to None for a particular account (this is done on the Account Governance screen), then the linked account cost amount will not be included as part of the cost calculation.\n\nIf the Cost Report Access field does have some cost value however, then it will be included as part of the cost calculation.\n\nThe cost amount of management account and onboarded member account is shown with a unique cloud provider account ID and service account ID.\n\n** The Posture page shows many views like – Account View, Tenant View, AWS Organization View, Azure CSP View, Azure EA View, GCP Parent Billing Account View, GCP Billing Account View, and Custom View. You must select the relevant view to get the correct cost details for a cloud account.\n\nGCP:\n\nThe Posture page shows the cost amount(s) of individual linked accounts in Account View and Tenant View.\n\nBudget Page:",

      "# [ServiceNow](https://docs.corestack.io/docs/servicenow)\nIntroduction\n\nServiceNow is an industry-leading tool, and one of the many tools which CoreStack supports today.\n\nServiceNow can be used to categorize, create, and manage data tables in a CMDB format for keeping track of your organization’s virtual assets in the cloud (virtual machines, databases, etc).\n\nIn this user guide, we'll explain how users can integrate their existing ServiceNow account with CoreStack.\n\nAdding ServiceNow Account in CoreStack\n\nThe following steps need to be performed to integrate a ServiceNow account.\n\nClick the Settings icon on the top left of CoreStack and select Integrated Tools from the menu. The Integrated Tools screen will be displayed.\n\nSelect ServiceNow in the left menu under the ITSM section.\n\nClick on the Add Account button.\n\nProvide the following details to add the ServiceNow account:\n\nClick on the Next button.\n\nSelect the products that must be governed using the ServiceNow account.\n\nClick on the Next button.\n\nIn Tools Configuration, the latest 5 existing ServiceNow requests from the Auth URL that you have provided will be listed as a drop-down in the _Request Selection _field.\n\nSelect a Request ID or specify a new Request ID. The attributes associated with the selected Request ID will be retrieved.\n\nMap these attributes with CoreStack attributes. To make the process simpler, you can click on SET DEFAULT.\n\nClick on the Next button.\n\nIn the following screen, Action Mapping and Status Mapping from CoreStack to ServiceNow and vice-versa will be performed.\n\nCatalog Mapping\n\nThe following steps need to be performed in the Catalog section of the ServiceNow configuration.\n\nClick on ‘Add New’ link.\n\nSelect “Technical Catalog” in the Catalog Selection drop-down to serve Scenario 2 (i.e. CoreStack as a self-service portal). That will be Public Cloud Automation.\n\nSelect “Service Catalog” in the Catalog Selection drop-down to serve Scenario 1 (i.e. ServiceNow as a self-service portal). That will be Network & Infrastructure.\n\n📘\n\nNote:\n\nFor Scenario 1, user should configure all the catalogs in ServiceNow manually that are available in CoreStack.\n\nIncident Management\n\nThe Incident Management section does not have any mandatory fields. The information provided in Configuration will be reflected in ServiceNow as per mapping.\n\nAuthorization\n\nIn this section, select the roles to which the integrated ServiceNow account should be available and click on the Finish button.\n\nApprover Settings\n\nTo make Request Management work through ITSM, you should configure ‘Set the Approver’ as ITSM.\n\nClick the Settings icon on the top left of CoreStack and select Account from the menu. The Account Management screen will be displayed.\n\nClick on the Identity tab.\n\nSelect Azure SSO from the Auth Type drop-down list.\n\nClick on Governance tab.\n\nClick on “Modify Settings” button to edit the settings in the Self Service Configuration sub-tab.\n\nSelect “Approval Required” in the Method field.\n\nSelect the “External” option in the Category drop-down list.\n\nSelect the “ITSM” option in the Type drop-down list.\n\nClick on Save Settings to save the changes.\n\nThis configuration will enable the orders placed to be sent for approval by an external user – an ITSM user (in ServiceNow).\n\nActivity Queue Settings\n\nThe Activity Queue settings must be configured for “Self Service” and “Alert”.\n\nClick Settings icon on the top left of CoreStack and select Tenants from the menu. Tenant Management screen will be displayed.\n\nSelect the required tenant from the list.\n\nSelect the Activity Queue Settings tab listed in the right-hand side.\n\nClick on the edit icon.\n\nEnable Alerts checkbox and select the ServiceNow account from the Integrated Tool Account dropdown list.\n\nEnable Self Service checkbox and select the ServiceNow account from the Integrated Tool Account dropdown list.\n\nClick on Apply icon to save the changes.\n\nAlerts should be enabled and configured to get the Incident Management alerts in ServiceNow.\n\nSelf Service should be enabled and configured to make the ITSM request management working.",

It will give you line by line every single type of api call, instance, storage etc for every service for every region broken down to the hour for each individual resource.\nAnd it is 100% complete compared to any other solution. Which often miss new services or costs which aren't tied to specific resources and so won't be visible via an api call enumeration.\nYou can get it in CSV or Parquet.\nAthena can be useful for querying it.\n\n## Comment ID hi6m380 with +12 score by [(moduspwnens14, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi6m380/) (in reply to ID qgj1gd):\nIt's not graphical, but [AWS Recon](https://github.com/darkbitio/aws-recon) does this.\n\n### Comment ID hi71go6 with +4 score by [(SmasherOfAjumma, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi71go6/) (in reply to ID hi6m380):\nGoing to check this out.

AWS Resource Groups: Tag Editor: All regions, All supported resource types and leave tag fields blank.

You could even go through and tag items with a Key of \"cost\" and value \"free\" to know what to exclude - because that resource is free.\n\n### Comment ID hi7b093 with +1 score by [(2nealalan, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi7b093/) (in reply to ID hi7agp8):\nOh yea, to run the CLI easily incase you're not on a Mac or Linux machine with the AWS CLI and can run that command...\n\nYou can use CloudShell (free):  \n[https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home?region=us-east-1#](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home?region=us-east-1#)\n\nDrop that shell command in w/out the leading dollar sign and you should have a nice list that you can scroll through or redirect to a file to download.\n\n## Comment ID hi6s8e1 with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi6s8e1/) (in reply to ID qgj1gd):\n[EC2 Global View](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/09/amazon-ec2-global-view-console-regions/). It's not fast, but it works. You can also resort to looking at your MTD (month to date) bills and breaking down by region. It doesn't yet support the full gamut of resources, but it will catch the most likely to give you bill shock.\n \nYou can also use SCPs to block the creation of resources outside regions you want to support.\n\n### Comment ID hi7rfds with +6 score by [(BooglesFoogles, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi7rfds/) (in reply to ID hi6s8e1):\nOP's question specifically asks for \"every resource\" whereas EC2 Global View is....just for EC2.\n\n#### Comment ID hi7uunl with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi7uunl/) (in reply to ID hi7rfds):\nAs I said, OP can also resort to the MTD view in the Billing Dashboard. It will show accrued usage even within the free tier (as the free tier is applied as a bill credit). OP should also consider the use of SCPs to outright block the creation of resources outside of those they intend to use in regions they intend to support.\n\n### Comment ID hi77o2v with +1 score by [(SharkbaitOoHaaHaa, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi77o2v/) (in reply to ID hi6s8e1):\nIMO this is the best answer, you're not using every region/service in AWS and so you may as well just block them explicitly, also saves the problem of \"oops wrong region\"\n\n#### Comment ID hi7c7m5 with +1 score by [(2nealalan, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi7c7m5/) (in reply to ID hi77o2v):\nIf I'm not mistaken, you can't explicitly block regions that are available, unless they were a region you manually enabled? \n\nSince this is the case, the user would want to have visibility to every possible region to ensure no one created resources in a region where they shouldn't have. (Accidentally or intentionally, \\*cough\\* crypto miner.)\n\n## Comment ID hi6no16 with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi6no16/) (in reply to ID qgj1gd):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID hi6s931 with +14 score by [(Vantage_Team, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi6s931/) (in reply to ID hi6no16):\nThanks for posting this! We're the team behind Vantage. To add to this, Vantage offers two features that help customers here:\n\n- Resource inventory: Gives you a full inventory of everything in your account. https://www.vantage.sh/features/resource-inventory\n\n- Advanced analytics: The ability to see day-by-day accrued costs on a per-resource basis for each active resource.  https://www.vantage.sh/features/advanced-analytics\n\nCost Explorer does not give a per-resource level of analysis outside of EC2. Vantage combines Cost and Usage Report (CUR) data and syncs periodically with service List/Describe API calls to be able to show this level of analytics for \"active\" resources.\n\n#### Comment ID hi6wb0k with +2 score by [(thectrain, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi6wb0k/) (in reply to ID hi6s931):\nThis might sound cheap.

We got several engineering wins.\n\nAndroid uses Jetpack Compose, MVVM and server-driven components. iOS uses home-grown [SliceKit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/v3hpns/the_slicekit_series_introducing_our_new_ios/), MVVM and server-driven components.\n\nHappy users. Happy devs. 🌈\n\n**---------------------------------------------**\n\n*This is Part 1 in the “Rewriting Home Feed” series. You can find Part 2 in next week's post.* \n\nIn mid-2022, we started working on a new tech stack for the Home and Popular feeds in Reddit’s Android and iOS apps. We shared about the new Feed architecture earlier. We suggest reading the following blogs written by  Merve and Alexey.\n\n[Re-imagining Reddit’s Post Units on Android : r/RedditEng](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/14wzqdb/reimagining_reddits_post_units_on_android/) \\- Merve explains how we modularized the feed components that make up different post units and achieved reusability.\n\n[Improving video playback with ExoPlayer : r/RedditEng](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1af2d8d/improving_video_playback_with_exoplayer/) \\- Alexey shares several optimizations we did for video performance in feeds. A must read if your app has ExoPlayer.\n\nAs of this writing, **we are happy and proud to announce the rollout of the newest Home Feed (and Popular, News, Watch & Latest Feed) to our global Android and iOS Redditors** 🎉. Starting as an experiment mid-2023, it led us into a path with a myriad of learnings and investigations that fine tuned the feed for the best user experience. This project helped us move the needle on several engineering metrics.\n\n## Defining the Success Metrics\n\nPrior to this project’s inception, we knew we wanted to make improvements to the Home screen. Time To Interact (TTI), the metric we use to measure how long the Home Feed takes to render from the splash screen, was not ideal. The response payloads while loading feeds were large. Any new feature addition to the feed took the team an average 2 x 2-week-sprints. The screen instrumentation needed much love. As the pain points kept increasing, the team huddled and jotted down (engineering) metrics we ought to move before it was too late.\n\nA good design document should cover the non-goals and make sure the team doesn’t get distracted. Amidst the appetite for a longer list of improvements mentioned above, the team settled on the following four success metrics, in no particular order.\n\n1. Home Time to Interact\n\nHome TTI = App Initialization Time (Code) + Home Feed Page 1 (Response Latency + UI Render)\n\nWe measure this from the time the splash screen opens, to the time we finish rendering the first view of the Home screen. We wanted to improve the responsiveness of the Home presentation layer and GQL queries.\n\n**Goals:** \n\n* Do as little client-side manipulation as possible, and render feed as given by the server.\n* Move prefetching Home Feed to as early as possible in the App Startup.\n\n**Non-Goals:**\n\n* Improve app initialization time. Reddit apps have made significant progress via prior efforts and we refrained from over-optimizing it any further for this project.\n\n1. Home Query Response Size & Latency\n\nOver the course of time, our GQL response sizes became heavier and there was no record of the Fields \\[to\\] UI Component mapping. At the same time, our p90 values in non-US markets started becoming a priority in Android. \n\n**Goals:**\n\n* Optimize GQL query strictly for first render and optimize client-side usage of the fragments. \n* Lazy load non-essential fields used only for analytics and misc. hydration.\n* Experiment with different page sizes for Page 1.\n\n**Non-Goals:**\n\n* Explore a non-GraphQL approach. In prior iterations, we explored a Protobuf schema. However, we pivoted back because adopting Protobuf was a significant cultural shift for the organization. Support and improving the maturity of any such tooling was an overhead.\n\n1. Developer Productivity\n\nAddition of any new feature to an existing feed was not quick and took the team an average of 1-2 sprints. The problem was exacerbated by not having a wide variety of reusable components in the codebase. \n\nThere are various ways to measure Developer Productivity in each organization. At the top, we wanted to measure New Development Velocity, Lead time for changes and the Developer satisfaction - all of it, only when you are adding new features to one of the (Home, Popular, etc.) feeds on the Reddit platform. \n\n**Goals:**\n\n* ~~Get shit done fast!~~ Get stuff done quicker.\n* Create a new stack for building feeds. Internally, we called it CoreStack.\n* Adopt the primitive components from [Reddit Product Language](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/13oxmqa/building_reddits_design_system_for_android_with/), our unified design system, and create reusable feed components upon that.\n* Create DI tooling to reduce the boilerplate.\n\n**Non-Goals:**\n\n* Build time optimizations. We have teams entirely dedicated to optimizing this metric. \n\n1. UI Snapshot Testing\n\nUI Snapshot test helps to make sure you catch unexpected changes in your UI. A test case renders a UI component and compares it with a pre-recorded snapshot file. If the test fails, the change is unexpected. The developers can then update the reference file if the change is intended. Reddit’s Android & iOS codebase had a lot of ground to cover in terms of UI snapshot test coverage.\n\n**Plan:** \n\n* Add reference snapshots for individual post types using [Paparazzi](https://github.com/cashapp/paparazzi) from Square on Android and [SnapshotTesting](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing) from Point-Free on iOS.\n\n## Experimentation Wins\n\nThe Home experiment ran for 8 months. Over the course, we hit immediate wins on some of the Core Metrics. On other regressed metrics, we went into different investigations, brainstormed many hypotheses and eventually closed the loose ends.\n\nLook out for Part 2 of this “Rewriting Home Feed” series explaining how we instrumented the Home Feed to help measure user behavior and close our investigations.\n\n1. Home Time to Interact (TTI)\n\nAcross both platforms, the TTI wins were great. This improvement means, we are able to surface the first Home feed content in front of the user 10-12% quicker and users will see Home screen 200ms-300ms faster.\n\n[Image 1: iOS TTI improvement of 10-12&#37; between our Control \\(1800 ms\\) and Test \\(1590 ms\\)](https://preview.redd.it/2gjj9lndkzrc1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=d53221a5ae9fc35e611df282aba009228b27be2f)\n\n[Image 2: Android TTI improvement of 10-12&#37; between our Control \\(2130 ms\\) and Test \\(1870 ms\\)](https://preview.redd.it/38r1iojjkzrc1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=596c6915b68ca894b14b9945094d00b0067973a5)\n\n### 2a. Home Query Response Size (reported by client)\n\nWe experimented with different page sizes, trimmed the response payload with necessary fields for the first render and noticed a decent reduction in the response size.\n\n[Image 3: First page requests for home screen with 50&#37; savings in gzipped response \\(20kb ▶️10kb\\)](https://preview.redd.it/buwybv8nkzrc1.jpg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68ba161d665455366bcd083ce6bc1edd32e75a8c)\n\n### 2b. Home Query Latency (reported by client)\n\nWe identified upstream paths that were slow, optimized fields for speed, and provided graceful degradation for some of the less stable upstream paths. The following graph shows the overall savings on the global user base. We noticed higher savings in our emerging markets (IN, BR, PL, MX).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Image 4: \\(Region: US\\) First page requests for Home screen with 200ms-300ms savings in latency](https://preview.redd.it/daj23j5tkzrc1.jpg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e847f3e51aa89e68850ca2910993d2679b72f7fa)\n\n[Image 5: \\(Region: India\\) First page requests with \\(1000ms-2000ms\\) savings in latency](https://preview.redd.it/5g6sp2zwkzrc1.jpg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d54900f9fd52f7732f8b352b154e779242b9743b)\n\n### 3. Developer Productivity\n\nOnce we got the basics of the foundation, the pace of new feed development changed for the better. While the more complicated Home Feed was under construction, we were able to rewrite a lot of other feeds in record time.\n\nDuring the course of rewrite, we sought constant feedback from all the developers involved in feed migrations and got a pulse check around the following signals. All answers trended in the right direction.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/khzphbg2lzrc1.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=573d808502e8fe121a60ea88563480362cbb4007\n\nFew other signals that our developers gave us feedback were also trending in the positive direction.\n\n* Developer Satisfaction\n* Quality of documentation\n* Tooling to avoid DI boilerplate\n\n#### 3a. Architecture that helped improve New Development Velocity\n\nThe previous feed architecture had a monolith codebase and had to be modified by someone working on any feed. To make it easy for all teams to build upon the foundation, on Android we adopted the following model:\n\n* :feeds:public provides extensible data source, repositories, pager, events, analytics, domain models. \n* :feeds:public-ui provides the foundational UI components.\n* :feeds:compiler provides the Anvil magic to generate GQL fragment mappers, UI converters and map event handlers.\n\n[Image 6: Android Feeds Modules](https://preview.redd.it/np5rb206lzrc1.jpg?width=244&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef5aeda3449b0ae2d50cf19a8e7b0e5d868ed091)\n\nSo, any new feed was to expect a plug-and-play approach and write only the implementation code. This sped up the dev effort. To understand how we did this on iOS, refer [Evolving Reddit’s Feed Architecture : r/RedditEng](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/158f8o3/evolving_reddits_feed_architecture/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Image 7: Android Feed High-level Architecture](https://preview.redd.it/3321kurblzrc1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=47f86783c4ff27f62594348c7ae39a170c5b07fb)\n\n### 4. Snapshot Testing\n\nBy writing smaller slices of UI components, we were able to supplement each with a snapshot test on both platforms. We have approximately 75 individual slices in Android and iOS that can be stitched in different ways to make a single feed item.\n\nWe have close to 100% coverage for:\n\n* Single Slices\n   * Individual snapshots - in light mode, dark mode, screen sizes.\n   * Snapshots of various states of the slices.\n* Combined Slices \n   * Snapshots of the most common combinations that we have in the system.\n\nWe asked the individual teams to contribute snapshots whenever a new slice is added to the slice repository. Teams were able to catch the failures during CI builds and make appropriate fixes during the PR review process.\n\n## </rewrite>\n\nContinuing on the above engineering wins, teams are migrating more screens in the app to the new feed architecture. This ensures we’ll be delivering new screens in less time, feeds that load faster and perform better on Redditor’s devices.\n\n**Happy Users. Happy Devs 🌈**\n\n*Thanks to the hard work of countless number of people in the Engineering org, who collaborated and helped build this new foundation for Reddit Feeds.*\n\n*Special thanks to our blog reviewers Matt Ewing, Scott MacGregor, Rushil Shah.*\n\n## Comment ID kxrmiz2 with +6 score by [(primosz, Reddit, 2024-04-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1btowiw/rewriting_home_feed_on_android_ios/kxrmiz2/) (in reply to ID 1btowiw):\nNice post!

The product we're working on is just a gem - a real masterpiece.

And the team we've hired is just top-notch - I'm pretty sure some of them just wandered in off the street.

      "# [CoreStack Unveils New Trailblazing White Paper Cloud Governance: Doing the Right Things Right by Diwakar Khatri on 2023-10-25](https://www.corestack.io/blog/corestack-unveils-new-trailblazing-white-paper-cloud-governance-doing-the-right-things-right/)\nThe paper provides a roadmap for enterprises to achieve model cloud governance in today's complex, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments\n\nBELLEVUE, WA, October 25, 2023 — CoreStack, a global multi-cloud governance provider, today announced that it has published a new white paper titled “Cloud Governance: Doing the Right Things Right,” marking the latest installment in its thought leadership publications focused on revolutionizing the cloud governance landscape. Authored by CoreStack’s Chief Strategy Officer, Robert Ford, the white paper covers all aspects of cloud governance, from strategy and planning to implementation and operations.\n\nCloud computing is growing rapidly and organizations are increasingly recognizing the importance of cloud governance. IDC forecasts that global cloud spend will reach $1.3 trillion by 2025. A Forrester study found that organizations with mature cloud governance practices achieve 20% higher cloud cost savings than those with immature practices. A Gartner study found that organizations with strong cloud governance practices are 50% less likely to experience a cloud security breach.\n\nAs cloud adoption, growth, and predictions continue to soar, cloud governance becomes of paramount strategic importance to every company in every segment and at every stage of cloud maturity. Ford explains, “Cloud management is about doing things right, whereas cloud governance is about doing the right things right. The latter is ever-more important in an increasingly connected and interdependent digital world, where spend, compliance, and security all wrestle for scarce resources.”\n\nFord's white paper provides a compelling argument for the importance of transitioning from traditional cloud management to NextGen cloud governance. His worldview is summed up in three key points:\n\nThe cloud is not merely an infrastructure; it is an organization-wide strategic initiative\n\nThe cloud serves as the nucleus around which all digital efforts revolve, informing business strategy\n\nCloud governance is essential for embracing the cloud with confidence and maximizing its value\n\nThe white paper delves into the various stages of the cloud journey, including the “why cloud,” “which cloud,” and “how cloud” aspects, emphasizing the need for the evolution of cloud governance to address complex challenges such as cost optimization, regulatory compliance, and security. Ford argues that a cloud governance platform is essential for enabling organizations to navigate the complexities of multi-cloud environments and ensure that the right things are done right, in real-time, across all cloud facets.\n\n“The need to move beyond reactive siloed cloud management to intelligent, highly automated multi-cloud governance has never been greater, as every organization strives to deliver optimized, compliant, and secure value to customers,” said Jim DuBois, tech advisor and former Microsoft CIO. “CoreStack’s approach to cloud governance is leading the charge to help customers embrace cloud with greater confidence.”\n\nLeading enterprises are already leveraging CoreStack Governance, a set of governance modules for FinOps, SecOps, and CloudOps, to govern more than $2B in annual cloud consumption. The CoreStack portfolio also includes CoreStack Assessments, a powerful assessment solution that streamlines and scales the cloud assessment process, allowing partners to run assessments against multiple cloud-native frameworks as well as custom frameworks.",

I was clicking on a pin to set it as GPIO_In, and suddenly the editor seemed to reset as if it had just been opened afresh (frame sizes reset and view position of the pins diagram changed). After that the editor was completely unresponsive and I noticed 'java' was using 100% of the CPU.\n\nI killed the java process and tried to restart, but it remained stuck on the splash screen. It has been a while since I updated the IDE so I downloaded 1.12.1 to see if it would help. I found that 1.12.1 will run ok if I set the workspace as an empty folder, but if I try to use the original workspace, then 1.12.1 will also freeze at the splash screen. It seems like something about the files of that project have been tainted.\n\nWhen starting the IDE from the comand line, I get this output:\n\n[chris@localhost ~]$ /opt/st/stm32cubeide_1.12.1/stm32cubeide_wayland 1 : Invalid condition id : UX_CORESTACK_Condition cause : null 1 : Invalid condition id : UX_CORESTACK_Condition cause : null 1 : Invalid condition id : UX_CORESTACK_Condition cause : null 1 : Invalid condition id : UX_CORESTACK_Condition cause : null 1 : Invalid condition id : UX_CORESTACK_Condition cause : null\n\nI am using Fedora Linux 36.
