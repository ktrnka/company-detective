CR360 provides new levels of visibility and insight without requiring multiple tools or cumbersome integrations. It adapts quickly as technology evolves and as cloud providers introduce new functionality, future-proofing cloud operations whether you run AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI, or all of the above.\n\nWith CR360, you get a 360-degree view of each cloud resource – a comprehensive perspective that includes anything and everything associated with a given resource. We associate the cloud resource with relevant workloads, dependencies, projects, and much more, providing a complete view of each cloud resource by applying different lenses to the data.\n\nThis approach allows a single platform to provide a unified experience that supports multiple disparate capabilities, including FinOps, SecOps, CloudOps, architecture assessments, and whatever comes next.\n\nAI can be a powerful ally, and having a solid foundation of cloud governance will enable you to embrace AI with greater confidence. The stronger your cloud governance model, the more likely you’ll be able to harness the unique capabilities of AI and apply them to solve complex business problems.\n\nWith CR360 as a foundation, we can continue with the next evolution of cloud governance by introducing machine-based intelligence.

      "# [Templates](https://docs.corestack.io/docs/templates)\nIntroduction\n\nOrchestration Templates are essentially infrastructure automation instructions written in \"YAML\" or \"JSON\" format. Templates can have multiple tasks within them, each of them performing a specific action in a target cloud or a tool. You may also have a single template to orchestrate across multiple cloud(s) and/or tool(s).\n\nCoreStack supports Templates of the formats: AWS CFN, Azure ARM, OpenStack HEAT, OpenStack MISTRAL, Terraform, Oracle, DM.\n\nOne of the key differentiators of CoreStack is its support for cloud-native DSL (Domain Specific Language) which ensures that there is no limitation in terms of the supported services within that platform.\n\nFor example, you can execute:\n\nCFN Templates against AWS\n\nARM Templates against Azure\n\nHEAT, MISTRAL, and Terraform Templates against OpenStack Public/Private Cloud Accounts\n\nYou can bring into CoreStack any of these templates with ease and re-use them outside of CoreStack if required.\n\nNavigation\n\nNavigate to Automation submenu under Operations in the Left navigation menu and select Templates option to land in Templates (Marketplace).\n\nThe tabs at the top represent the scope of the templates. You can see 2 tabs: Marketplace and My Templates.\n\nMarketplace\n\nCoreStack provides a wide range of pre-defined templates which can help in realizing multiple use cases. The marketplace lists the templates available across multiple clouds and tools. These are pre-loaded for all subscriptions and are FREE to be executed on-demand or scheduled.\n\nThese templates are available across all tenants and are usually created by the Product Administrator.\n\n📘\n\nTip:\n\nThese templates have the scope value set to Global.\n\n🚧\n\nNote:\n\nAfter the default template is added in CoreStack, there would be an approximate sync time required (which might be for of 30 minutes or more) to view the template added by you. Till then, you will see a message \"Template Synchronization is in progress. Please check back after some time.\"\n\nIn case of any discrepancies, we advise you to contact [email protected].\n\nMy Templates\n\nThese templates have been created by users within the tenant. These are available only for users within the tenant. You can add more templates or edit/delete existing templates in this tab based on your role and access policies.\n\n📘\n\nTip:\n\nThese templates have the scope value set to Tenants.\n\n🚧\n\nNote:\n\nAfter the default template is added in CoreStack, there would be an approximate sync time required (which might be for of 30 minutes or more) to view the template added by you. Till then, you will see a message \"Template Synchronization is in progress. Please check back after some time.\"\n\nIn case of any discrepancies, we advise you to contact [email protected].\n\nSearch and Filter Templates\n\nCoreStack offers search and filter functions to help quickly look for the templates you need to execute. The Search bar is available just above the templates list. To Filter Templates, you can click on the \"Filter\" icon placed to the right end above the templates list.\n\nThe Text Search helps you search using any string available in the following fields:\n\nName of the Template\n\nDescription of the Template\n\nType\n\nDSL\n\nClassification\n\nService\n\nThe text search is thus quite useful in refining your search results based on any little information you have on the preferred result set.\n\nCoreStack also offers Filters to help you narrow down the list of templates by using one or a combination of filters. On clicking the Filter icon, you will see the list of Filter options available as shown below. Select the preferred options and click on \"Apply Filter\" button at the bottom of this box.\n\n📘\n\nTip:\n\nUse the Reset button to quickly remove all selected filters and view all results.\n\nOnce you decide on a template that you would like to try out, you can execute it on-demand or schedule it for a one-time or recurring execution(s) in future.\n\nView Template Details\n\nTo get more information about a specific template, click on the template to open the 'Template Detail' page. You can view the attributes related to the template and update the values if required by clicking on Update.\n\nThe actual content of the template, which is in 'YAML' or 'JSON' format is also displayed. Click 'Edit' button and make changes to the content if required.\n\nTemplate Actions\n\nTemplate actions will be shown to every template listed when you are hovering mouse on a template. The list of actions depends on the scope of the template (Marketplace, My Templates) and the RBAC access for templates that user has.\n\nExecute – Executes the template immediately and redirects to \"Job history\" where you can see the status and output of the execution.\n\nEdit– Modifies the properties, content, metadata of the Template. It's like Template Create workflow.\n\nSchedules – Similar to Execute, but schedules it to be run later once/multiple times.\n\nDelete – Deletes the template\n\nExecute Template\n\nExecutes the template against Cloud Accounts and performs the tasks specified in the template. In 'Job History' you can find the status and outputs for this execution. Execute requires following inputs:\n\nJob Name – Optional. If not given system will generates this.\n\nCloud Account – Cloud Account need to be used for execution.\n\nCloud Account Additional Info – Additional Info of Cloud Account (E.g., Resource Group, Location, Region).\n\nExecution Parameters – Additional parameters from the Template.\n\nA sample Template execute window, for a simple example of taking an \"AWS_EC2_Instance_With_SecurityGroup\" is shown below:\n\nThe Cloud Accounts lists the available list of AWS cloud accounts in this Tenant.\n\nOnce the Cloud Account details are selected, click on \"Load Execute parameters\" to get the input parameters of the template.\n\nYou can enter/select values from dropdown for input params based on need and hit \"Run\" to execute the template.\n\nOnce a template is executed, it is run as a \"Job\" within CoreStack. You can check the execution logs and job status from the \"Job History\" tab.\n\n📘\n\nTips:\n\nMost of the input parameter values are fetched automatically from the respective cloud account. This is very useful in choosing real-time values from the cloud. There is no need to login to the AWS Console to refer these details.\n\nYou can use the \"?\" on the right side of each input parameter to understand more about the parameter.\n\nTerraform Templates\n\nIn addition to being able to execute and manage orchestration templates from a base of pre-existing templates, users can also execute Terraform templates in the platform from a GitHub Enterprise code repository via an integration.\n\nWith this feature, users can store their Terraform code in a GitHub Enterprise repository and then configure a pipeline that automatically pulls the code and executes it. This enables teams to collaborate on infrastructure configuration and allows for easy version control and auditing of changes.\n\n📘\n\nCI/CD Config File Management\n\nAutomation available through the platform now provides the opportunity to edit/manage the saved CI/CD config files on the GitHub deployment repo for provisioned resources. Users will be able to perform an edit and save the changes in the config management of provisioned resources.\n\nAfter a user edits and saves these pre-existing CI/CD configuration files on the deployment repo for the provisioned resources through the platform, the existing Azure DevOps/ADO pipeline will detect the changes to these CI/CD config files and trigger the pipeline execution. This in turn will update the configuration setting of the resource on the target account.\n\nEnable Access to your GitHub Repository\n\nUsers can authorize GitHub repository access with a personal access token, which will enable them to clone and run Terraform templates stored in GitHub through the platform.\n\nTo do this, start by clicking the plus icon (+) on the Automation > Templates > My templates page to open the Create Template menu.\n\nAfter users provide all the necessary details in the Template Property section, they can select the Git option under the Template Content section.\n\nAt this point, users can upload individual or multiple Terraform folders through a .zip file through the import feature.\n\nUsers can choose the optional values from Terraform and leave them as optional in the platform during template execution without them being mandated.\n\nViewing Terraform Template Content\n\nAfter a template is imported or created under the Terraform category, users can view it by selecting it from the available templates, then selecting the content tab. This will show the Terraform template content with proper coding alignment in order to help interpret the code.\n\nView and Download .tfstate file for Executed Terraform Templates\n\nDuring the execution of a Terraform template, users will be able to view the .tfstate file created as part of the execution.\n\nThis is shown as a card under the Job History tab. Select that tab and then select the Terraform State tab for any executed Terraform templates along the right side to view the code contents of the file. This file can also be downloadable for reference by clicking the download icon.\n\n📘\n\nNote:\n\nUpload JSON Support: The platform now provides the ability to upload Terraform templates through JSON.\n\nUsers can choose either .json or .tf format to save and commit their Terraform template parameters.\n\nDownload Job Result: The platform now supports the download of executed Terraform job logs.\n\nDeleting and Rolling Back Templates that Failed to Execute\n\nUsers can use the ‘delete’ option when a particular template fails to execute, which will act as a rollback to remove all the changes made and bring it back to its original state, so that it can be re-run later.\n\nUsers can access this option under the Job History tab by selecting the delete icon from the available action buttons along the top of the page.\n\nSchedule Template\n\nThis schedules the template execution to be run later once or multiple times. For example, you can schedule backup for an Instance daily. The schedule requires the following details:\n\nName – Name of the schedule.\n\nDescription – Detailed description about the schedule.\n\nSchedule Settings – Execution options. Template can be scheduled to execute Once or to repeat after specified Minutes, Hours, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly.\n\nCloud Account – Cloud Account need to be used for execution.\n\nCloud Account Additional Info – Additional Info of Cloud Account (e.g. Resource Group, Location, Region).\n\nExecution Parameters – Additional parameters from the Template.\n\nAn example screenshot of scheduling a template is shown below:\n\nThe list of schedules created for that specific tenant can be viewed from the Schedules tab.\n\nCreate (Upload) Custom Templates\n\nCoreStack also provides the option for users to upload their own templates and use them to execute against their service accounts. Follow the steps given below: Use the '+' button next to the 'Search' bar at top right.\n\nTemplate create window will have 3 sections as follows: Properties, Content, and Metadata.\n\nJob History\n\nLists all template executions of the current tenant. A sample screenshot is shown below. The tabs at the top right represents the archive status of jobs. You can see 2 tabs: Active Jobs and Archived Jobs.\n\nThe Template Job History page offers search and filter functions to help quickly look for the executions. The Search bar is available just above the jobs list. To Filter Jobs, you can click on the \"Filter\" icon placed to the right end above the Job detail tab.\n\nTemplate Job History page also has Archive, Un-Archive and Delete Actions. These actions can be used to have limited number of executions in Job history page.\n\nJob history page has option to refresh the Jobs list. This will help when you are landing here from template execute page. By the time you are landing the Job might be IN_PROGRESS state. This will help to refresh the status.\n\nTemplate Jobs list show the following columns in the list.\n\nTemplate Name – Name of the Template executed.\n\nJob Name – Name of the Job which is generated by the CoreStack with Template name and some random characters.\n\nCloud Accounts – Name of the Cloud Account selected when executing.\n\nRun Date – Date & Time of the Job execution.\n\nType – Execution Type (On-Demand, Scheduled, or System).\n\nStatus – Status of the Job execution.\n\nActions – Actions will be available for CloudFormation and HEAT templates. In CloudFormation and HEAT each template execution considered as stack, which supports the update and delete actions. Update action used to update the attributes of the resources where Delete action removed all the resources created by that execution.\n\nTemplate Job Detail will be shown on clicking Job from the list. This will show three tabs. Inputs, Output, and Task.\n\nInputs – Cloud Account details and input parameters passed for the execution.\n\nOutput – Outputs from the template execution.\n\nTask – List of tasks or resources executed in this template.\n\nSchedules\n\nLists all template execution schedules of the current tenant. The tabs at the top right represents the schedule status. You can see 2 tabs: Upcoming and Past. Upcoming will list the schedules which are active, to be execute on future based on its scheduled time. Past will list the schedules which are no longer going to be executed. For example, Scheduled Once will be moved to the Past tab after its execution.\n\nA sample screenshot is shown below:\n\nThe Template Schedules page offers search and filter functions to help quickly look for the schedules. The Search bar is available just above the schedules list. To Filter Jobs, you can click on the \"Filter\" icon placed to the right end above the Schedule detail tab.\n\nTemplate Schedules list show the following columns in the list:\n\nSchedule Name – Name of the schedule.\n\nTemplate – Name of the Template Scheduled.\n\nRecurrence – Recurrence of the Schedule (Once/ Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Yearly).\n\nNext Run Time – Date and Time of the Next execution.\n\nRequested By – CoreStack username who created the schedule.\n\nTemplate Schedule Detail will be shown on clicking Schedule from the list. This will show the execution history the schedule which will redirect to Job history page and filter by this schedule. It's also supports the following actions on schedule.\n\nEdit (All Occurrences) – Modifies the Schedule like Schedule Create.\n\nDelete (All Occurrences) – Deletes the Schedules.\n\nCoreStack also provides control over the next execution of the schedule. You can remove the next execution or can edit the next execution time alone without modifying the schedule.\n\nFor example, in a daily 12pm schedule, you can change the time of the next execution.",

      "# [Budget](https://docs.corestack.io/docs/budget)\nIntroduction to Budget Management\n\nCloud cost contributes a big portion of the expenses incurred by enterprises. It is important to control these expenses by regularly monitoring the cost incurred by different departments in an enterprise.\n\nMany organizations use different budgeting mechanisms for managing and planning their cloud spend for different teams/departments to run a predictable business.\n\nIn comparison to traditional on-premises budgeting, cloud budget management is much more complex due to the variable costs involved with multiple cloud services. Multi-cloud environment makes it even more complex.\n\nThe key factor involved in budget planning and forecasting is to remove the surprise factor from the cloud billing and allocate/distribute money efficiently. The bigger opportunity with budget planning and forecasting is about how to effectively use cloud and improve the financial and business predictability.\n\nCloud budget management consists of four components:\n\nForecast: The variable nature of cloud costs, enables you to cut down waste. But at the same time, it requires an efficient forecasting model that can analyze, not only the historical billing data but also derive patterns from these data. Similarly, forecasting is needed for an effective cloud usage and reserved instance planning.\n\nMonitor: The ability to set budgets and monitor them periodically at multiple levels.\n\nReport: The actual or forecasted data must be continuously reported and provided to all stakeholders on a periodic basis.\n\nRespond: When budgets are at risk, automated responses and actions must be available. It will provide flexibility to respond at various budget thresholds.\n\nCoreStack Budget Management\n\nCoreStack Budget Management provides flexibility and support for budget forecasting and planning needs of organizations of all sizes and cost centers that span one or more public cloud providers.\n\nCoreStack enables you to define budgets for various departments and control the expenses on cloud within budget. This feature also provides insights in real-time about the budgets configured as the cloud spend constantly changes.\n\nNavigation\n\nTo open Budget Management dashboard, in the left navigation menu, click Cost and select the Budget option.\n\nYou can view the budget rules summary in the Budget Management dashboard. It includes the budget rules created to monitor and control the cloud accounts cost. It also provides the number of budget rules configured and the total number of alerts triggered by the budget rules.\n\nFilters\n\nThe Budget Management dashboard includes following filters to refine and view the budget details.\n\nCloud Provider: Filters the budget details by cloud providers.\n\nCloud Account: Filters the budget details by cloud accounts.\n\nCurrency: Displays the values in the selected currency.\n\nCloud Account Type: Filters the budget details by cloud account type.\n\nAdvanced Filters: Filters the budget details using advanced options. For example, budget period, budget amount, actual spend, and forecasted spend.\n\nDownload Budget Details\n\nTo download configured budgets information displayed in the Budget Management dashboard as .CSV or .PDF file, click Download icon.\n\nRecent Alerts and Insights\n\nThe Recent Alerts & Insights section includes details about the most recent alerts triggered by the budget rules configured in the account and the key insights that were derived as part of budget management operations.\n\nTo open Alerts & Insights, click View All.\n\nAlerts\n\nThis tab lists budget rule triggered alerts.\n\nInsights\n\nThis tab lists budget rule details. It provides log of all actions performed with respect to triggered thresholds.\n\nSync with Cloud\n\nYou can import budgets created in public cloud account to CoreStack. When a cloud account is onboarded into CoreStack, all budgets created in the cloud account are imported automatically and listed in the Budget Management dashboard.\n\nOnce a cloud account is onboarded, CoreStack periodically synchronize the budgets from cloud native experience every 24 hours. You can also synchronize budgets created in cloud provider account on demand.\n\nClick arrow button in the Budget Management dashboard and select Sync with Cloud. It will sync cloud account and export budget details into CoreStack.\n\n📘\n\nOne-way budget sync\n\nPlease note that budget sync from cloud provider accounts is only one-way. Currently, any budgets created in CoreStack portal are not synced to your cloud provider experience.\n\nDashboard Views\n\nCoreStack provides multiple views for the Budget Management dashboard. You can save the preferred view and preserve settings. For example, the selected filters for respective logins.\n\nDifferences in Cost Data Between Budget and Cost Posture Pages\n\n📘\n\nNote:\n\nUsers may notice some discrepancies in the spend history data when creating a new budget rule and the overall cost data shown on the Cost Posture page. This is due to some differences in how cost data is added up based on the cloud account type and page view.\n\nThese differences are explained in more detail below.\n\nPosture Page:\n\nAWS:\n\nThe Account View shows the cost amount associated with a management account excluding the costs associated with any member account(s) (member account costs are shown individually).\n\nThe Tenant View shows the cost amount(s) associated with onboarded member accounts along with the amount(s) associated with the management account.\n\nIf the Cost Report Access field is set to None for a particular account (this is done on the Account Governance screen), then the linked account cost amount will not be included as part of the cost calculation.\n\nIf the Cost Report Access field does have some cost value however, then it will be included as part of the cost calculation.\n\nThe cost amount of management account and onboarded member account is shown with a unique cloud provider account ID and service account ID.\n\n** The Posture page shows many views like – Account View, Tenant View, AWS Organization View, Azure CSP View, Azure EA View, GCP Parent Billing Account View, GCP Billing Account View, and Custom View. You must select the relevant view to get the correct cost details for a cloud account.\n\nGCP:\n\nThe Posture page shows the cost amount(s) of individual linked accounts in Account View and Tenant View.\n\nBudget Page:",

You can also select another item in “Compare with” to compare the graph.\n\nClick view forecast to see the forecast data\n\nConfigure Zabbix Hosts\n\nMap Existing Host Names with Cloud Resource Names\n\nCoreStack will automatically fetch the utilization data based on the condition that the “resource name” (from cloud provider) matches with the “host name” configured in Zabbix. If this doesn't match, CoreStack will not collect data.\n\nIf there are hosts configured in Zabbix, which have different names in the cloud, you can follow the below instructions to map them manually.\n\nGo to Inventory ->Enable Services -> Monitoring\n\nUnconfigured -> This will list down all resources that are not configured for utilization data Click edit icon on the left side of the corresponding resource and provide the host name configured in Zabbix. The provided name will be validated against the corresponding Zabbix account configured. If host is valid and available, CoreStack will start collecting utilization data.\n\nAdd New Hosts to Zabbix\n\nCoreStack provides you out of the box (Marketplace) Templates to add a new hosts to Zabbix. There are templates for adding with/without agent.\n\nUsers can execute those templates against the Zabbix account onboarded with the required inputs. This is particularly useful to include them as a standard task while provisioning new resources in the cloud.\n\nAlerts and Remediation\n\nIf the configured trigger (threshold alert) under “trigger config” is reached, CoreStack will receive a metric alert.

It will give you line by line every single type of api call, instance, storage etc for every service for every region broken down to the hour for each individual resource.\nAnd it is 100% complete compared to any other solution. Which often miss new services or costs which aren't tied to specific resources and so won't be visible via an api call enumeration.\nYou can get it in CSV or Parquet.\nAthena can be useful for querying it.\n\n## Comment ID hi6m380 with +12 score by [(moduspwnens14, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi6m380/) (in reply to ID qgj1gd):\nIt's not graphical, but [AWS Recon](https://github.com/darkbitio/aws-recon) does this.\n\n### Comment ID hi71go6 with +3 score by [(SmasherOfAjumma, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi71go6/) (in reply to ID hi6m380):\nGoing to check this out.

It's not fast, but it works. You can also resort to looking at your MTD (month to date) bills and breaking down by region.

      "# Post ID 1btowiw: Rewriting Home Feed on Android & iOS with +53 score by [(beautifulboy11, Reddit, 2024-04-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1btowiw/rewriting_home_feed_on_android_ios/)\n*Written by* *Vikram Aravamudhan*\n\n**ℹ️tldr;**\n\nWe have rewritten Home, Popular, News, Watch feeds on our mobile apps for a better user experience. We got several engineering wins.\n\nAndroid uses Jetpack Compose, MVVM and server-driven components. iOS uses home-grown [SliceKit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/v3hpns/the_slicekit_series_introducing_our_new_ios/), MVVM and server-driven components.\n\nHappy users. Happy devs. 🌈\n\n**---------------------------------------------**\n\n*This is Part 1 in the “Rewriting Home Feed” series. You can find Part 2 in next week's post.* \n\nIn mid-2022, we started working on a new tech stack for the Home and Popular feeds in Reddit’s Android and iOS apps. We shared about the new Feed architecture earlier. We suggest reading the following blogs written by  Merve and Alexey.\n\n[Re-imagining Reddit’s Post Units on Android : r/RedditEng](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/14wzqdb/reimagining_reddits_post_units_on_android/) \\- Merve explains how we modularized the feed components that make up different post units and achieved reusability.\n\n[Improving video playback with ExoPlayer : r/RedditEng](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1af2d8d/improving_video_playback_with_exoplayer/) \\- Alexey shares several optimizations we did for video performance in feeds. A must read if your app has ExoPlayer.\n\nAs of this writing, **we are happy and proud to announce the rollout of the newest Home Feed (and Popular, News, Watch & Latest Feed) to our global Android and iOS Redditors** 🎉. Starting as an experiment mid-2023, it led us into a path with a myriad of learnings and investigations that fine tuned the feed for the best user experience. This project helped us move the needle on several engineering metrics.\n\n## Defining the Success Metrics\n\nPrior to this project’s inception, we knew we wanted to make improvements to the Home screen. Time To Interact (TTI), the metric we use to measure how long the Home Feed takes to render from the splash screen, was not ideal. The response payloads while loading feeds were large. Any new feature addition to the feed took the team an average 2 x 2-week-sprints. The screen instrumentation needed much love. As the pain points kept increasing, the team huddled and jotted down (engineering) metrics we ought to move before it was too late.\n\nA good design document should cover the non-goals and make sure the team doesn’t get distracted. Amidst the appetite for a longer list of improvements mentioned above, the team settled on the following four success metrics, in no particular order.\n\n1. Home Time to Interact\n\nHome TTI = App Initialization Time (Code) + Home Feed Page 1 (Response Latency + UI Render)\n\nWe measure this from the time the splash screen opens, to the time we finish rendering the first view of the Home screen. We wanted to improve the responsiveness of the Home presentation layer and GQL queries.\n\n**Goals:** \n\n* Do as little client-side manipulation as possible, and render feed as given by the server.\n* Move prefetching Home Feed to as early as possible in the App Startup.\n\n**Non-Goals:**\n\n* Improve app initialization time. Reddit apps have made significant progress via prior efforts and we refrained from over-optimizing it any further for this project.\n\n1. Home Query Response Size & Latency\n\nOver the course of time, our GQL response sizes became heavier and there was no record of the Fields \\[to\\] UI Component mapping. At the same time, our p90 values in non-US markets started becoming a priority in Android. \n\n**Goals:**\n\n* Optimize GQL query strictly for first render and optimize client-side usage of the fragments. \n* Lazy load non-essential fields used only for analytics and misc. hydration.\n* Experiment with different page sizes for Page 1.\n\n**Non-Goals:**\n\n* Explore a non-GraphQL approach. In prior iterations, we explored a Protobuf schema. However, we pivoted back because adopting Protobuf was a significant cultural shift for the organization. Support and improving the maturity of any such tooling was an overhead.\n\n1. Developer Productivity\n\nAddition of any new feature to an existing feed was not quick and took the team an average of 1-2 sprints. The problem was exacerbated by not having a wide variety of reusable components in the codebase. \n\nThere are various ways to measure Developer Productivity in each organization. At the top, we wanted to measure New Development Velocity, Lead time for changes and the Developer satisfaction - all of it, only when you are adding new features to one of the (Home, Popular, etc.) feeds on the Reddit platform. \n\n**Goals:**\n\n* ~~Get shit done fast!~~ Get stuff done quicker.\n* Create a new stack for building feeds. Internally, we called it CoreStack.\n* Adopt the primitive components from [Reddit Product Language](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/13oxmqa/building_reddits_design_system_for_android_with/), our unified design system, and create reusable feed components upon that.\n* Create DI tooling to reduce the boilerplate.\n\n**Non-Goals:**\n\n* Build time optimizations. We have teams entirely dedicated to optimizing this metric. \n\n1. UI Snapshot Testing\n\nUI Snapshot test helps to make sure you catch unexpected changes in your UI. A test case renders a UI component and compares it with a pre-recorded snapshot file. If the test fails, the change is unexpected. The developers can then update the reference file if the change is intended. Reddit’s Android & iOS codebase had a lot of ground to cover in terms of UI snapshot test coverage.\n\n**Plan:** \n\n* Add reference snapshots for individual post types using [Paparazzi](https://github.com/cashapp/paparazzi) from Square on Android and [SnapshotTesting](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing) from Point-Free on iOS.\n\n## Experimentation Wins\n\nThe Home experiment ran for 8 months. Over the course, we hit immediate wins on some of the Core Metrics. On other regressed metrics, we went into different investigations, brainstormed many hypotheses and eventually closed the loose ends.\n\nLook out for Part 2 of this “Rewriting Home Feed” series explaining how we instrumented the Home Feed to help measure user behavior and close our investigations.\n\n1. Home Time to Interact (TTI)\n\nAcross both platforms, the TTI wins were great. This improvement means, we are able to surface the first Home feed content in front of the user 10-12% quicker and users will see Home screen 200ms-300ms faster.\n\n[Image 1: iOS TTI improvement of 10-12&#37; between our Control \\(1800 ms\\) and Test \\(1590 ms\\)](https://preview.redd.it/2gjj9lndkzrc1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=d53221a5ae9fc35e611df282aba009228b27be2f)\n\n[Image 2: Android TTI improvement of 10-12&#37; between our Control \\(2130 ms\\) and Test \\(1870 ms\\)](https://preview.redd.it/38r1iojjkzrc1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=596c6915b68ca894b14b9945094d00b0067973a5)\n\n### 2a. Home Query Response Size (reported by client)\n\nWe experimented with different page sizes, trimmed the response payload with necessary fields for the first render and noticed a decent reduction in the response size.\n\n[Image 3: First page requests for home screen with 50&#37; savings in gzipped response \\(20kb ▶️10kb\\)](https://preview.redd.it/buwybv8nkzrc1.jpg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68ba161d665455366bcd083ce6bc1edd32e75a8c)\n\n### 2b. Home Query Latency (reported by client)\n\nWe identified upstream paths that were slow, optimized fields for speed, and provided graceful degradation for some of the less stable upstream paths. The following graph shows the overall savings on the global user base. We noticed higher savings in our emerging markets (IN, BR, PL, MX).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Image 4: \\(Region: US\\) First page requests for Home screen with 200ms-300ms savings in latency](https://preview.redd.it/daj23j5tkzrc1.jpg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e847f3e51aa89e68850ca2910993d2679b72f7fa)\n\n[Image 5: \\(Region: India\\) First page requests with \\(1000ms-2000ms\\) savings in latency](https://preview.redd.it/5g6sp2zwkzrc1.jpg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d54900f9fd52f7732f8b352b154e779242b9743b)\n\n### 3. Developer Productivity\n\nOnce we got the basics of the foundation, the pace of new feed development changed for the better. While the more complicated Home Feed was under construction, we were able to rewrite a lot of other feeds in record time.\n\nDuring the course of rewrite, we sought constant feedback from all the developers involved in feed migrations and got a pulse check around the following signals. All answers trended in the right direction.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/khzphbg2lzrc1.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=573d808502e8fe121a60ea88563480362cbb4007\n\nFew other signals that our developers gave us feedback were also trending in the positive direction.\n\n* Developer Satisfaction\n* Quality of documentation\n* Tooling to avoid DI boilerplate\n\n#### 3a. Architecture that helped improve New Development Velocity\n\nThe previous feed architecture had a monolith codebase and had to be modified by someone working on any feed. To make it easy for all teams to build upon the foundation, on Android we adopted the following model:\n\n* :feeds:public provides extensible data source, repositories, pager, events, analytics, domain models. \n* :feeds:public-ui provides the foundational UI components.\n* :feeds:compiler provides the Anvil magic to generate GQL fragment mappers, UI converters and map event handlers.\n\n[Image 6: Android Feeds Modules](https://preview.redd.it/np5rb206lzrc1.jpg?width=244&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef5aeda3449b0ae2d50cf19a8e7b0e5d868ed091)\n\nSo, any new feed was to expect a plug-and-play approach and write only the implementation code. This sped up the dev effort. To understand how we did this on iOS, refer [Evolving Reddit’s Feed Architecture : r/RedditEng](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/158f8o3/evolving_reddits_feed_architecture/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Image 7: Android Feed High-level Architecture](https://preview.redd.it/3321kurblzrc1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=47f86783c4ff27f62594348c7ae39a170c5b07fb)\n\n### 4. Snapshot Testing\n\nBy writing smaller slices of UI components, we were able to supplement each with a snapshot test on both platforms. We have approximately 75 individual slices in Android and iOS that can be stitched in different ways to make a single feed item.\n\nWe have close to 100% coverage for:\n\n* Single Slices\n   * Individual snapshots - in light mode, dark mode, screen sizes.\n   * Snapshots of various states of the slices.\n* Combined Slices \n   * Snapshots of the most common combinations that we have in the system.\n\nWe asked the individual teams to contribute snapshots whenever a new slice is added to the slice repository. Teams were able to catch the failures during CI builds and make appropriate fixes during the PR review process.\n\n## </rewrite>\n\nContinuing on the above engineering wins, teams are migrating more screens in the app to the new feed architecture. This ensures we’ll be delivering new screens in less time, feeds that load faster and perform better on Redditor’s devices.\n\n**Happy Users. Happy Devs 🌈**\n\n*Thanks to the hard work of countless number of people in the Engineering org, who collaborated and helped build this new foundation for Reddit Feeds.*\n\n*Special thanks to our blog reviewers Matt Ewing, Scott MacGregor, Rushil Shah.*\n\n## Comment ID kxrmiz2 with +5 score by [(primosz, Reddit, 2024-04-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1btowiw/rewriting_home_feed_on_android_ios/kxrmiz2/) (in reply to ID 1btowiw):\nNice post! It seems like you monitor many metrics on the client-side, are you using some analytics tool for this (ex. Firebase -> BigQuery), out-of-the-box (ex. Sentry.io), or have something custom build for this purpose?\n\n### Comment ID kxtjk6g with +2 score by [(droidvik, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1btowiw/rewriting_home_feed_on_android_ios/kxtjk6g/) (in reply to ID kxrmiz2):\nThanks for the question. Android & iOS apps use a custom built (event) pipeline for recording analytics from the client. BigQuery is where the cleansed data is available to be queried. MWeb/desktop could be using some of the third-party vendors apart from our custom built pipeline. (I'm trying to find an article on r/RedditEng that covers it).\n\nHaving said that, we're working on the Part 2 of this blog. We will be covering about the instrumentation of Home Feed that help us understand the granular user behavior. More on that soon.\n\n### Comment ID kxtw9vz with +1 score by [(One-Honey-6456, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1btowiw/rewriting_home_feed_on_android_ios/kxtw9vz/) (in reply to ID kxrmiz2):\nI am curious to know what performance metrics are being tracked at Reddit and how they are tracked.\n\n#### Comment ID kxw7e66 with +4 score by [(Okhttp-Boomer, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1btowiw/rewriting_home_feed_on_android_ios/kxw7e66/) (in reply to ID kxtw9vz):\nFeeds have some special handling and profiling which the team will cover in upcoming posts!   \n\n\n\\*\\*\\* \n\nMetrics Improvements are ongoing.

This is primarily due to the priorities of technical problems to solve in each platform and different levels of maturity within the code base to support such a library.  \n  \n**Multi-platform**: However, the Reddit's design system is built on [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/) (built on KMP) and could theoretically be used by all our platforms, when a need arises.

      "# [The CoreStack Platform on 2024-07-04](https://www.corestack.io/solutions/platform/)\nThe heart of the CoreStack platform is CR360™ (Cloud Resource 360) – the single system of intelligence for all your cloud resources. CR360 provides new levels of visibility and insight without requiring multiple tools or cumbersome integrations. It adapts quickly as technology evolves and as cloud providers introduce new functionality, future-proofing cloud operations whether you run AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI, or all of the above.\n\nWith CR360, you get a 360-degree view of each cloud resource – a comprehensive perspective that includes anything and everything associated with a given resource. We associate the cloud resource with relevant workloads, dependencies, projects, and much more, providing a complete view of each cloud resource by applying different lenses to the data.\n\nThis approach allows a single platform to provide a unified experience that supports multiple disparate capabilities, including FinOps, SecOps, CloudOps, architecture assessments, and whatever comes next.\n\nAI can be a powerful ally, and having a solid foundation of cloud governance will enable you to embrace AI with greater confidence. The stronger your cloud governance model, the more likely you’ll be able to harness the unique capabilities of AI and apply them to solve complex business problems.\n\nWith CR360 as a foundation, we can continue with the next evolution of cloud governance by introducing machine-based intelligence. The key to maximizing the value of AI is what we call AI-on-AI or AI2. Because GenAI understands language, output from one AI can be fed to another AI to enhance, transform, or interpret business problems and agendas.\n\nCoreStack’s AI agents, or co-pilots, are designed to take advantage of this feature. By enabling AI systems to interact and learn from each other, we unlock new levels of automation, insight, and adaptability that were previously unthinkable.",

      "# [Best Practices For Managed Service Providers (MSPs) To Reduce Operational Costs – CoreStack by Diwakar Khatri on 2019-01-02](https://www.corestack.io/blog/best-practices-for-managed-service-providers-msps-to-reduce-operational-costs/)\nIn the previous blog post on Managed Service Providers (MSPs), we discussed how CoreStack helps MSPs gain and retain new customers by bringing in Process Standardization. Here, we will highlight the best practices for MSPs to reduce internal costs in cloud management projects for their customers.\n\nBest Practices for Reducing Operational Costs\n\n1. Reduce the Complexity\n\nThe most significant operational bottleneck for agility is the complexity in managing infrastructure and services across multiple cloud providers. By using the right abstraction at the management layer, MSPs can reduce the complexity and the associated costs. The cloud management layer should also provide capabilities such as orchestration, provisioning, monitoring, security, and governance. Thereby reducing the dependency on additional tools and the complexity that comes along.\n\n2. Simpler Interfaces\n\nPick a platform that provides simpler interfaces for service provisioning and management. Self-service interface and Blueprints can help dramatically reduce costs. Additionally, a programmable interface will help in increased automation, which as we will see below, will help reduce costs. All of this will help MSPs manage operations with minimal dependency on highly skilled resources.\n\n3. Automate, Automate, Automate\n\nAutomation is key to any modern infrastructure. It can significantly help MSPs to achieve higher internal operational efficiencies. By leveraging data and event specific automation, MSPs can reduce human resources costs, be agile, and ensure a seamless DevOps. They can then replicate this automated model across their customers and scale. A cloud management platform that easily integrates with a variety of tools, and offers a programmatic interface for automation is critical for the success of holistic automation.\n\n4. Minimize Project Risks\n\nOne of the major sources of IT failures (including when MSP is responsible for the IT) is human errors. It is critical for MSP’s to focus on process automation over individuals. This will help them reduce errors and, also, save costs.\n\n5. Powerful Alerting Engine\n\nTo ensure the overall health of automation in perfect shape and to provide value to customers, MSPs should use a powerful alerting engine. The one which uses a rules-based approach as well as machine learning to help MSPs spot problems before it hits their customers.\n\n6. Integrated Security and Governance\n\nSecurity and compliance should not be an afterthought. It should be part of the cloud management platform. This ensures that MSPs have complete visibility and control over their customer environments.",

      "# [How to Build a Successful FinOps Practice – CoreStack by Diwakar Khatri on 2022-04-20](https://www.corestack.io/blog/how-to-build-a-successful-finops-practice/)\nFinOps practice helps organizations maximize business value by managing cloud costs with accountability, and efficient financial and operational control. The more complex the organization and its cloud infrastructure and usage – e.g., Number of teams, workloads, and clouds – the greater the need for FinOps discipline. Building this culture of financial discipline is an iterative journey, which involves starting small, and growing in scale, scope, and complexity as the business matures. The journey requires complete visibility into the cloud infrastructure; you need to know where you are to figure out where you need to go!\n\nTalking to industry experts, customers, and partners we have observed that organizations are in different stages of this journey.

To navigate the dynamic nature of cloud and find new and innovative ways to improve topline growth while keeping costs down, today's business leaders are looking for solutions that help them operate a lean and optimized cloud that is secure and agile. To build a secure, high-performing, and resilient cloud infrastructure, AWS has developed best practices called the ‘AWS Well-Architected Framework’.\n\nThe AWS Well-Architected Framework provides specific guidelines to build efficient cloud-based workloads and align business and engineering teams for operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability. The AWS Well-Architected Framework has been a guide for building secure, efficient, reliable, cost-effective, and high-performance workloads on AWS for nearly a decade. In this webinar, we will dive into AWS recommendations on the Well-Architected Framework.\n\nThe Speakers:\n\nRich Boyd, AWS Well-Architected Geo Solutions Architect, AWS\n\nParthu Kishen, VP Product Management, CoreStack\n\nParul Chheda, VP Strategic Alliances, CoreStack\n\nWatch the webinar to learn how .\n\n<\n\nWho should watch this webinar?",
      "# [Why Cloud Resource Consistency is Paramount to Effective Governance – CoreStack by Diwakar Khatri on 2021-04-16](https://www.corestack.io/blog/why-cloud-resource-consistency-is-paramount-to-effective-governance/)\nIn the previous blog post (part 6 of the cloud governance series), we discussed cloud access governance. In this blog, we talk about the fifth pillar of OSCAR Governance framework which is Cloud Resource Governance.\n\nResource consistency is one of the fundamental steps to consider for cloud governance. It is important to organize cloud assets as per the organization needs – organization structure, financial accounting practices, and application needs. It helps in numerous ways in following consistent & standard practices pertaining to resource deployment, management, and reporting.\n\nFor example, you can have standard deployment templates using Azure resource manager (ARM) or AWS CloudFormation (CFN) for a specific resource group. Similarly grouping of governance policies, access controls and applying them to one or more resource groups will simplify the implementation of overall cloud governance.\n\nThe decisions regarding the level of cloud resource consistency requirements are primarily driven by three factors:\n\nPost-migration digital estate size\n\nBusiness or environmental complexity\n\nOn-going governance enforcement\n\nSource: Azure resource consistency decision guide\n\nStandardize naming conventions\n\nA standardized and well-defined naming convention is the starting point for organizing cloud resources. It will help in identifying and grouping cloud resources for both IT and business purposes such as compliance audits, cost accounting etc. If you are already using a naming convention in your current IT set-up, decide whether to carry that forward to cloud or establish new standards. It is recommended to come up with naming guidelines which are common across the entire IT landscape whether it is cloud or on-premise or a mix.\n\nResource tagging\n\nAn effective cloud governance relies on good tag hygiene. A disciplined and well-designed tag hygiene will help in numerous ways\n\nSupport critical governance initiatives for cost reporting, cost optimization, charge-back security, and compliance\n\nEasily discover every cloud resource on-demand\n\nTo establish ownership of the resource for effective charge-back mechanism both for maintenance and for billing\n\nTo understand which environment the cloud resource belongs to – production, development, staging, or QA. You can then apply policies based on these tags. For example, turn off all development resources on a weekend\n\nTo facilitate financial accounting process with different billing codes (for different kinds of cloud spend) mapped to the tags\n\nSource: Azure cloud-adoption-framework\n\nThe real benefit of tagging can be realized only when it is enforced globally across all teams. Even a slightest deviation will defeat the purpose.\n\nWith this we have covered all the key pillars of the OSCAR Cloud Governance model i.e., Operations, Security, Cost, Access, and Resources. Here is a quick recap of what we discussed in this 7-part blog series on Cloud Governance.\n\nAccessing and consuming cloud is very easy. Unfortunately, it is not the same to operate cloud in a secure, compliant, and a cost-effective manner. Enterprises often face major roadblocks as their traverse the cloud journey which often results in reassessing if cloud indeed is the way forward. The good news is that these challenges are not insurmountable.\n\nTo be successful in cloud, automation and governance are indispensable.\n\nBefore diving into the execution details which would entail technical discussions, it is paramount to understand the governance needs at a strategic level. Develop clarity on the key business outcomes to be achieved by implementing governance. Accordingly, scope the requirements, their implementation model, and the success criteria. Irrespective of the cloud platform, there are a few common principles which together offer an effective governance. They are related to cloud visibility, costs, operations, compliance, security, resource consistency, and access control.\n\nCloud service providers offer governance services. However, they often lack the depth enterprises need as per the standards and regulations they need to adhere to. Their value diminishes further in the multi-cloud environments. Hence, third-party governance solutions which are cloud agnostic and continually pursue innovation related to governance are rising in importance.\n\nGovernance must not block agility and the autonomy of the cloud users.\n\nIt must empower them to leverage the power of cloud at that time that matters to continually roll out innovative solutions. All while ensuring the enterprise security and compliance needs.",
