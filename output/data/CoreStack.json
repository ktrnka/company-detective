It will give you line by line every single type of api call, instance, storage etc for every service for every region broken down to the hour for each individual resource.\nAnd it is 100% complete compared to any other solution. Which often miss new services or costs which aren't tied to specific resources and so won't be visible via an api call enumeration.\nYou can get it in CSV or Parquet.\nAthena can be useful for querying it.\n\n## Comment ID hi6m380 with +12 score by [(moduspwnens14, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi6m380/) (in reply to ID qgj1gd):\nIt's not graphical, but [AWS Recon](https://github.com/darkbitio/aws-recon) does this.\n\n### Comment ID hi71go6 with +3 score by [(SmasherOfAjumma, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi71go6/) (in reply to ID hi6m380):\nGoing to check this out.

AWS Resource Groups: Tag Editor: All regions, All supported resource types and leave tag fields blank. This will show you everything you have.  \n\n[https://console.aws.amazon.com/resource-groups/tag-editor/find-resources?region=us-east-1#query=regions:!%28%27AWS::AllSupported%27%29,resourceTypes:!%28%27AWS::AllSupported%27%29,tagFilters:!%28%29,type:TAG\\_EDITOR\\_1\\_0](https://console.aws.amazon.com/resource-groups/tag-editor/find-resources?region=us-east-1#query=regions:!%28%27AWS::AllSupported%27%29,resourceTypes:!%28%27AWS::AllSupported%27%29,tagFilters:!%28%29,type:TAG_EDITOR_1_0)\n\nIf you want to run this as a CLI and output a list of ARNs by region:\n\n$ for REGION in $(aws ec2 describe-regions --region us-east-1 --query \"Regions\\[\\].{Name:RegionName}\" --output text); do  \necho $REGION;  \naws resourcegroupstaggingapi get-resources --region $REGION --output text \\\\  \n\\--query 'ResourceTagMappingList\\[\\*\\].\\[ResourceARN\\]'; done\n\nThese aren't the \"dashboard\" you're looking for, but they should get the job done. You could even go through and tag items with a Key of \"cost\" and value \"free\" to know what to exclude - because that resource is free.\n\n### Comment ID hi7b093 with +1 score by [(2nealalan, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi7b093/) (in reply to ID hi7agp8):\nOh yea, to run the CLI easily incase you're not on a Mac or Linux machine with the AWS CLI and can run that command...\n\nYou can use CloudShell (free):  \n[https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home?region=us-east-1#](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home?region=us-east-1#)\n\nDrop that shell command in w/out the leading dollar sign and you should have a nice list that you can scroll through or redirect to a file to download.\n\n## Comment ID hi6s8e1 with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi6s8e1/) (in reply to ID qgj1gd):\n[EC2 Global View](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/09/amazon-ec2-global-view-console-regions/). It's not fast, but it works. You can also resort to looking at your MTD (month to date) bills and breaking down by region. It doesn't yet support the full gamut of resources, but it will catch the most likely to give you bill shock.\n \nYou can also use SCPs to block the creation of resources outside regions you want to support.\n\n### Comment ID hi7rfds with +6 score by [(BooglesFoogles, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi7rfds/) (in reply to ID hi6s8e1):\nOP's question specifically asks for \"every resource\" whereas EC2 Global View is....just for EC2.\n\n#### Comment ID hi7uunl with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi7uunl/) (in reply to ID hi7rfds):\nAs I said, OP can also resort to the MTD view in the Billing Dashboard. It will show accrued usage even within the free tier (as the free tier is applied as a bill credit). OP should also consider the use of SCPs to outright block the creation of resources outside of those they intend to use in regions they intend to support.\n\n### Comment ID hi77o2v with +1 score by [(SharkbaitOoHaaHaa, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi77o2v/) (in reply to ID hi6s8e1):\nIMO this is the best answer, you're not using every region/service in AWS and so you may as well just block them explicitly, also saves the problem of \"oops wrong region\"\n\n#### Comment ID hi7c7m5 with +1 score by [(2nealalan, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi7c7m5/) (in reply to ID hi77o2v):\nIf I'm not mistaken, you can't explicitly block regions that are available, unless they were a region you manually enabled? \n\nSince this is the case, the user would want to have visibility to every possible region to ensure no one created resources in a region where they shouldn't have. (Accidentally or intentionally, \\*cough\\* crypto miner.)\n\n## Comment ID hi6no16 with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi6no16/) (in reply to ID qgj1gd):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID hi6s931 with +14 score by [(Vantage_Team, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi6s931/) (in reply to ID hi6no16):\nThanks for posting this! We're the team behind Vantage. To add to this, Vantage offers two features that help customers here:\n\n- Resource inventory: Gives you a full inventory of everything in your account. https://www.vantage.sh/features/resource-inventory\n\n- Advanced analytics: The ability to see day-by-day accrued costs on a per-resource basis for each active resource.  https://www.vantage.sh/features/advanced-analytics\n\nCost Explorer does not give a per-resource level of analysis outside of EC2. Vantage combines Cost and Usage Report (CUR) data and syncs periodically with service List/Describe API calls to be able to show this level of analytics for \"active\" resources.\n\n#### Comment ID hi6wb0k with +2 score by [(thectrain, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/qgj1gd/aws_tool_service_to_see_everything_that_we_have/hi6wb0k/) (in reply to ID hi6s931):\nThis might sound cheap.

It's a real treat to work with people who have absolutely no idea how to compete in the market and make decisions behind closed doors without telling us anything. The product we're working on is just a gem - a real masterpiece. I mean, sure, there are some underlying technical issues that could make it collapse like a house of cards, but who cares about that when you've got a product that's just so-so? And the team we've hired is just top-notch - I'm pretty sure some of them just wandered in off the street. All in all, I'm feeling really confident about the future of this company - confident that we'll be bankrupt in 18-24 months. It's just such a joy to be part of something that's going downhill so fast.",

      "# [The CoreStack Platform on 2024-07-04](https://www.corestack.io/solutions/platform/)\nThe heart of the CoreStack platform is CR360™ (Cloud Resource 360) – the single system of intelligence for all your cloud resources. CR360 provides new levels of visibility and insight without requiring multiple tools or cumbersome integrations. It adapts quickly as technology evolves and as cloud providers introduce new functionality, future-proofing cloud operations whether you run AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI, or all of the above.\n\nWith CR360, you get a 360-degree view of each cloud resource – a comprehensive perspective that includes anything and everything associated with a given resource. We associate the cloud resource with relevant workloads, dependencies, projects, and much more, providing a complete view of each cloud resource by applying different lenses to the data.\n\nThis approach allows a single platform to provide a unified experience that supports multiple disparate capabilities, including FinOps, SecOps, CloudOps, architecture assessments, and whatever comes next.\n\nAI can be a powerful ally, and having a solid foundation of cloud governance will enable you to embrace AI with greater confidence. The stronger your cloud governance model, the more likely you’ll be able to harness the unique capabilities of AI and apply them to solve complex business problems.\n\nWith CR360 as a foundation, we can continue with the next evolution of cloud governance by introducing machine-based intelligence. The key to maximizing the value of AI is what we call AI-on-AI or AI2. Because GenAI understands language, output from one AI can be fed to another AI to enhance, transform, or interpret business problems and agendas.\n\nCoreStack’s AI agents, or co-pilots, are designed to take advantage of this feature. By enabling AI systems to interact and learn from each other, we unlock new levels of automation, insight, and adaptability that were previously unthinkable.",
      "# [Why Naya Ventures Invested in CoreStack? by Dayakar Puskoor on 2020-03-30](https://www.dallasvc.com/post/why-naya-ventures-invested-in-corestack)\nI am excited to share that Naya Ventures was the lead investor in the US$ 8.5 MM Series A investment in Seattle based Cloud Management Platform company CoreStack (www.corestack.io). Naya Ventures has been investing in enterprise focused cloud technology companies. We were particularly pleased with the value that CoreStack was delivering to enterprises pursuing Digital Transformation Strategies. Cloud and Digital Transformation are inseparable. CoreStack is uniquely placed in the Cloud Value Chain, the TCO/ROI benefits that CoreStack brings to enterprises, the AI/ML based autonomous character of CoreStack platform and the founding teams expertise in building foundational technology for Microsoft Azure were one among the several factors that influenced Naya Ventures to invest in CoreStack.\n\nMicrosoft Azure and Amazon Web Services are the core of cloud computing architectures for enterprises pursuing digital transformation strategies. Google and IBM are following suit to gain enterprise mindshare. However, as pioneers both Microsoft and Amazon have been benefitting the most as enterprises pursue a multi-cloud architecture. Multi-cloud architectures present challenging problems and the response to these problems starts with an ombudsman aka Cloud Management Platform, one of the fastest growing cloud market segments with an addressable market of US$ 32 BB by 2021 offering CoreStack an abundance of opportunities. We are excited for CoreStack as they have built a cutting and bleeding edge Autonomous Cloud Management Platform ready for prime time use by enterprises.\n\nI was earlier referring to the challenges multi-cloud architectures present for enterprises. The challenges include optimizing costs, ensuring compliance and adhering to governance standards like GDPR, FedRAMP, California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Etc. Cloud Management Platforms helps enterprises to ensure ongoing compliance to meet the governance and regulatory standards. A study by Object Management Group has revealed that good governance is measurable, and studies show that organizations with above average IT governance have over 20% higher profits than those with inadequate governance. CoreStack’s has a visionary approach to addressing the challenges with their 4Cs approach: Cost, Compliance, Cloud Operations, and Consumption that has won them recognition from industry leading analyst firms including Gartner which featured CoreStack as a ‘Cool Vendor’ in its report titled ‘Cool Vendors in Cloud Computing’ published on 11 October 2019. CoreStack is one of the only four vendors from the cloud computing space named in this coveted report from Gartner.\n\nNaya is keen to invest in companies with management teams with domain expertise. CoreStack has a seasoned management team led by industry veterans with deep domain expertise in enterprise software, IT infrastructure and managed services with most of leadership team having worked at Mindtree, that was responsible for the infrastructure development of Microsoft Azure. This expertise in Microsoft Azure has given CoreStack an edge over their competition with a Cloud Management Platform that is ready for mission critical use by enterprises.\n\nNaya Ventures is excited to lead the Series A funding of US $8.5 million for CoreStack along with a prominent Silicon Valley based VC firm. Naya Ventures believes the CoreStack team is on the verge of accomplishing a unique position in this blooming new Cloud Management Platform market. The CoreStack leadership team has an extensive history of working with each other and has invested their time and own money into their platform development and operations. CoreStack has already built momentum and gained traction with a 3x growth in its last financial year. CoreStack leadership team has been further strengthened in recent months with the addition of a Chief Revenue Officer and a Chief Marketing Officer with strong experience of participating in numerous growth companies including unicorns and have had successful exits of their own.\n\nNaya Ventures mantra has been “Leading by Collaboration” and is looking forward to providing hands-on guidance to its portfolio companies to create value for portfolio companies as well as to Naya’s investors. Naya’s proven engagement model of Invest, Engage, Collaborate, Grow and Exit with its portfolio companies has had numerous successful results (Altia Systems acquired by GN Audio/Jabra, Hyperverge, Amplif.ai etc.). Naya aids in areas of strategy, business development, hiring, product strategy, follow-on funding, networking and strategic transactions. In that spirit Naya already enabled CoreStack to license its platform to the world’s largest commercial real estate service in the world.",
