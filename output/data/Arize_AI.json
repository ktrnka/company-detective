      "# [ML Model Monitoring & Data Science Glossary on 2021-12-14](https://arize.com/glossary/)\nAccuracy\n\nAccuracy is the measure of the number of correct predictions made by the model. It is derived by calculating the percentage of correct predictions out of overall predictions. accuracy = correct predictions / all predictions\n\nExample: There are 100 credit card transactions; 90 transactions are legitimate and 10 transactions are fraudulent. If your model predicts that 95 transactions are legitimate and 5 transactions are fraudulent, its accuracy is:\n\n95% = (90 correct legitimate + 5 correct fraudulent) / 100 transactions\n\nAdditional resources\n\nML Observability 101 Ebook\n\nBest practices for observing ML models in production\n\nMonitoring Model Performance\n\nThe playbook to monitoring your model's performance in production\n\nCanary Deployment\n\nA method of testing a new model or model version where only a small subset of production data flows through this model to verify response performance before making a complete cutover. This technique allows for deeper analysis and understanding of model behavior and can minimize risk that regressions severely impact the business or customers.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nMove Fast Without Breaking Things In ML\n\nAn overview on managing change, including use of canary deployments\n\nModel Deployment and Serving\n\nThings to look for in model servers\n\nClassification Model\n\nClassification models are used to predict categories or assign a class label. Any given data is classified into a set of categories or groups to determine its further use or for processing needs.\n\nData that can be classified into one category or a second category is known as binary data. For example, fraud or not fraud, male or female.\n\nIf the set of data can be classified into a number of categories or groups, each based on a different criterion, such data is known as multi-class data. For example, education level, household income.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nThe Model's Shipped; What Could Possibly Go Wrong?\n\nIdentifying model failure modes with classification models\n\nConfusion Matrix\n\nA confusion matrix provides a summary of all prediction results of a classification problem. Each result is shown with its corresponding number of correct/incorrect predictions (see True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, False Negative), count values and classification criteria. By providing a neat summary of all possible results, the confusion matrix lets you know the ways your classification model could get confused when making the predictions. It helps identify errors and the type of errors made by the model and thus helps improve the accuracy of the classification model.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nUnderstanding Bias in ML Models\n\nUtilizing a confusion matrix\n\nCurrent Distribution\n\nCurrent Distribution refers to the statistical distribution, or shape, of the dataset being generated by a machine learning model in production. Distribution of datasets in machine learning models are represented in the form of functions that show the relationships between the various observations, visually presented in the form of curves or graphs.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nUsing Statistical Distances In ML\n\nMeasuring drift\n\nModel Drift\n\nOne-stop shop for all things drift-related.\n\nDrift\n\nDrift is defined as the change in the data over time. It also means the change in the properties of the target variable, due to unpredictable or unforeseen changes, over the due course of time.\n\nData drift can be described as the change in the distribution of data, between the real-time data and the baseline data that was predicted or set beforehand.\n\nConcept drift is the change between the relationship between input and the output given in any situation.\n\nDrift can be in any form. It can be gradual, recurring, or sudden. It can be a positive or negative drift. The change in data over time can affect model outcomes, making drift an important metric to monitor when it comes to model performance.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nTake My Drift Away\n\nHow to troubleshoot and resolve the underlying issue when drift occurs\n\nModel Drift\n\nA one-stop shop for all things drift-related\n\nMonitor Drift\n\nHow to troubleshoot drift with Arize\n\nEmbedding\n\nIn natural language processing (see definition of ‘natural language processing), embedding is a term used for the representation of words for text analysis, typically in the form of a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word such that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning.\n\nEvaluation Window\n\nThe evaluation window is plot of the period or duration of time against the metric being calculated. For instance, the previous 30 days. Any evaluation metric that can be represented as a duration of time can be visualized as an evaluation window.\n\nF-score\n\nMeasure of the harmonic mean of precision and recall. F-score is a result of integrating these parameters into one for a better understanding of the accuracy of the model. F-score can be modified into F, 0.5, 1, & 2 based on the measure of weightage given to precision over recall.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nMonitoring Model Performance\n\nMonitoring model performance in production using F1\n\nFalse Negative\n\nWhen a model mistakenly predicts a negative class, when the value belongs to the positive class.\n\nExample: A model flags a credit card transaction as ‘not fraud’ when it is actually a fraudulent transaction\n\nAdditional resources\n\nBest Practices In ML Observability for Monitoring, Mitigating and Preventing Fraud\n\nReal-world use-cases: fraud models\n\nBest Practices In ML Observability for Click-Through Rate Models\n\nReal-world use-cases: click through rate models\n\nFeature Importance\n\nFeature importance is a compilation of a class of techniques that take in all the features related to making a model prediction and assign a certain score to each feature to weigh how much or how little it impacted the outcome. These scores can then be used to better understand the internal logic of a model, make necessary changes to the model to improve its accuracy, and also reduce unnecessary inputs.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nModel Explainability\n\nA primer on global, cohort, and local explainability\n\nFeature Performance Heat Map\n\nA feature performance heat map is a visual representation of the performance of each feature in a given model. It enables users to quickly see slices of performance or features that perform significantly better or worse than others for faster triangulation of issues. Heat maps are especially useful when troubleshooting.\n\nJS Distance\n\nJS distance is a symmetric derivation of KL divergence, and it is used to measure drift. In addition to being an actual metric (as opposed to KL), it is bounded by the square root of ln(2). For two distributions P and Q, the formula for JS distance is shown below. Use JS distance to compare distributions with low variance.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nUsing Statistical Distances for Machine Learning\n\nCommon Metrics for Drift and Where To Use Them\n\nWhen I Drift, You Drift, We Drift\n\nUnderstanding Different Types of Model Drift\n\nTake My Drift Away\n\nStrategies for Responding to Model Drift\n\nKolmogorov Smirnov Test\n\nUseful in drift monitoring, the Kolmogorov Smirnov test (KS test) is a widely used nonparametric technique for comparing difference between a sample with a baseline or reference probably distribution). KS test is an efficient drift metric to measure if two distributions significantly differ from one another. The Kolmogorov Smirnov statistic quantifies the maximum distance between two cumulative distribution functions.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nUsing Statistical Distances for Machine Learning\n\nTake My Drift Away\n\nMachine Learning Observability 101\n\nLIME\n\nLIME, or “Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations,” is an explainability method that attempts to provide local ML explainability. At a high level, LIME attempts to understand how perturbations in a model’s inputs affect the end-prediction of the model. Since it makes no assumptions about how the model reaches the prediction, it can be used with any model architecture, hence the “model-agnostic” part of LIME. The LIME explainability approach takes a single input value of predictions and perturbs the inputs around those values. It then builds a linear model off of the feature perturbations where the coefficients are the feature importances at this local prediction.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nModel Explainability\n\nA deeper dive into global, cohort and local explainability across ML lifecycle including LIME\n\nLIME Paper\n\nExplaining the predictions of any classifier\n\nMAE\n\nMean Absolute Error is a regressive loss measure looking at the absolute value difference between a model’s predictions and ground truth, averaged out across the dataset. Unlike MSE, MAE is weighted on a linear scale and therefore doesn’t put as much weight on outliers. This provides a more even measure of performance, but means large errors and smaller errors are weighted the same. Something to consider depending on your specific model use case.\n\nMAPE\n\nMean Absolute Percentage Error is one of the most common metrics of model prediction accuracy and the percentage equivalent of MAE. MAPE measures the average magnitude of error produced by a model, or how far off predictions are on average. See MAE for considerations when using this metric.\n\nMSE\n\nMean Square Error a regressive loss measure. The MSE is measured as the difference between the model’s predictions and ground truth, squared and averaged out across the dataset. It is used to check how close the predicted values are to the actual values. As in RMSE, a lower value indicates a better fit, and it heavily penalizes large errors or outliers.\n\nPerformance Slice\n\nA performance slice is a subset of model values of interest in performance analysis and troubleshooting. Slices can be formed from any model dimension, including specific periods of time, set of features, etc. Performance slice analysis is useful when the goal is to understand or troubleshoot a cohort of interest, such as with bias detection, where the generalized dataset might mask statistical nuances.\n\nPopulation Stability Index (PSI)\n\nPopulation Stability Index looks at the magnitude which a variable has changed or shifted in distribution between two samples over the course of a given time. PSI is calculated as: PSI = (% Actual – % Expected) x ln(% Actual / % Expected)\n\nThe larger the PSI, the less similar your distributions are, which allows you to set up thresholding alerts on the drift in your distributions. PSI is a great metric for both numeric and categorical features where distributions are fairly stable.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nUsing Statistical Distances for Machine Learning\n\nA white paper on commonly used statistical distance metrics, including PSI\n\nRMSE\n\nRoot Mean Square Error (also known as root mean square deviation, RMSD) is a measure of the average magnitude of error in quantitative data predictions. It can be thought of as the normalized distance between the vector of predicted values and the vector of observed (or actual) values.\n\nBecause errors are squared before averaged, this measure gives higher weight to large errors, and therefore useful in cases where you want to penalize models accordingly.\n\nROC – AUC\n\nThe Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) is a probability curve plotted between true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR). Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds. Together, ROC – AUC represents the degree of separability, or how much a model is capable of distinguishing between classes.\n\nThe higher the AUC (i.e. closer to 1), the better the model is at predicting 0 class as 0, and 1 class as 1.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nWhat Is AUC?\n\nA quick-and-intuitive explanation of AUC -- includes gifs that animate how the ROC curve is constructed.\n\nSHAP\n\nSHAP stands for “Shapley Additive Explanations”, a concept derived from game theory and used to explain the output of machine learning models (see definition of ‘Explainability’). SHAP values help interpret how much a given feature or input contributes, positively or negatively, to the target outcome or prediction. See ‘Feature Importance’\n\nAdditional resources\n\nModel Explainability\n\nA primer on global, cohort, and local explainability\n\nUsing Explainability\n\nHow to use SHAP with Arize\n\nSpecificity\n\nSpecificity is the fraction of values predicted to be of a negative class out of all the values that truly belong to the negative class (including false positives). This measure is similar to recall, but describes the offset in correcting predicting negative values. It is also called the true negative rate.\n\nspecificity = predicted true negatives / (true negatives + false positives)\n\nExample: There are 100 credit card transactions; 90 transactions are legitimate and 10 transactions are fraudulent (negative class). If your model predicts that 20 transactions are fraudulent, its recall is:\n\n50% = 10 true negatives / (10 true negatives + 10 false positives)\n\nTabular Data\n\nData in a table format, with columns and rows. Inputs of the model in a table format (i.e. an Excel spreadsheet), where columns might be feature inputs (i.e city, state, charge amount). NLP and images do not fit in an excel sheet, since inputs are sentences or images.\n\nTags\n\nOften used alongside model features, tags enable metadata support for slicing and cohorting. They are a convenient workaround to analyze groups of metadata that are important, but that an ML team might not want to send as an input to a model. In other words, tags avoid conflating two separate entities — features and other metadata — while empowering deep model analysis across cohorts of any kind.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nTags In The Arize Platform\n\nAmerica First Credit Union On How They Use Tags\n\nTrue Negative\n\nWhen a model correctly predicts a negative class, when the value belongs to the negative class.\n\nExample: A model flags a credit card transaction as ‘not fraud’ when it is actually a legitimate transaction.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nBest Practices In ML Observability for Click-Through Rate Models\n\nReal-world use-cases: click through rate (CTR) models\n\nBest Practices in ML Observability for Monitoring, Mitigating and Preventing Fraud\n\nReal-world use-cases: fraud models\n\nTrue Positive\n\nWhen a model correctly predicts a positive class, when the value belongs to the positive class.\n\nExample: A model flags a credit card transaction as ‘fraud’ when it is actually a fraudulent transaction.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nBest Practices for Monitoring Fraud Models\n\nReal-world use-cases: fraud models\n\nBest Practices for Monitoring Click Through Rate Models\n\nReal-world use-cases: click through rate (CTR) models",

Being able to easily monitor every request/response cycle with latency is great however I'm using open source llm for sensitive data. I don't want to use a third party tool with API calls etc. I know there's a on-premise version but that seems expensive. Do you know any truly open source alternative ? I've seen Langfuse but it seems like a \"kind of\" open source, a bit like MySQL back in time, and we all know how it ended. Did you use it ? Any feedback ? Anything else ?\n\n## Comment ID kr53vx6 with +18 score by [(kryptkpr, Reddit, 2024-02-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1aujfiz/real_free_alternative_to_langsmith/kr53vx6/) (in reply to ID 1aujfiz):\nI use two:\n\nhttps://github.com/langfuse/langfuse\n\nhttps://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix\n\nWhat is issue with langfuse - it's MIT licensed, how much more open do you want?\n\nBased on your needs I'd start with langfuse, but Phoenix is the GOAT if you have embeddings.\n\n### Comment ID kr9xgnq with +3 score by [(IlEstLaPapi, Reddit, 2024-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1aujfiz/real_free_alternative_to_langsmith/kr9xgnq/) (in reply to ID kr53vx6):\nPhoenix seems like a very good tool, thanks a lot, at first view it's exactly what I was looking for and more.\n\nAbout Langfuse, it's just that after the MySQL experience I'm very cautious about orgs that are using an open-source license but are profit driven. You never know when there're going to be bought by Oracle, but at some point it might happen and then it's catastrophic. Especially when you have a support that is API/cloud oriented with the possibility to do selfhosting.

Thank you to anyone who can help me or point me in the right direction.\n\n**TLDR**: I'm so desperate for user interviews I'm willing to debase myself for 30 minutes of your time.   \nI am trying to find people to talk to who have shipped or are close to shipping a feature that integrates with a 3rd party LLM. I have questions about LLM evaluation because we're building product around that, somewhat tangential to langsmith. I need to expand way beyond my personal network. \n\nI have tried searching forums, posting in slack groups, attending in person events in SF, swiping right on every ML engineer, user interview recruiting sites but I'm coming up with a lot of people who are still dabbling with the tech but haven't hit real development yet. Most of the folks I've talked to just haven't gotten to any real \"LLM evaluation\" needs yet. \n\nLangchain's series A announcement said they have 80k users, so surely there are some people here that fit my mold?\n\nI am **desperate** to pick your brain for 30 minutes about your \"genai stack\" and how you figure out if a LLM-integrated solution is behaving well on your data for your users. \n\nI would gladly send you a thank you milk bar pie, buy you a bougie coffee shop gift card, take you on a date (34/F/SF) or yell at your boss for you or for a few moments of your time. \n\nPlease DM me if we can chat sometime in the next week or two.

I'm also working on evluations for GenAI stuff. As of now we have tried langsmith evluations. Tracing stuff is valuable to check out what happened in every step during chain which is easier than putting bunch of print in between your chain or having langchain output verbose to terminal. We are usin langsmith for basically debugging as of now.\n\nThat is why I decided probably can use it for evaluations too. I've integrated their API to upload dataset and let our users choose from built in evaluators lik conciseness, correctness, etc. It does evaluate your chain on these evaluators and provide a score and comment. This is definitely something we want in evaluation part of the stack. I'm also looking into phoenix will let you know my thoughts once I try it.\n\nAs of now I'm mostly in research/finding out phase, Looking into requirements and trying out existing evaluations stack out there. As of now I've come up with fee like\n\n1. Having Expectd Datasets (+ If you're able to generate it partially and get it reviewed by user)\n2. Have evaluations criterias to evaluate entire chain and rate it a fixed score for comparisons between evaluations. (Maybe also have rating of steps in the chain?? not sure how helpful would this be and hard to implement)\n3. Helping user find out what went wrong in their chains during evaluations a clear guide where they might be lacking ex. Letting them know the LLM did not have enought context or Prompt does not mention conciseness to produce short answer, etc.\n\nWill share more details as I'm actively working on this.\n\n### Comment ID l1o82ir with +2 score by [(wymzi, Reddit, 2024-04-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1ayaf7p/langsmith_for_evaluation_or_something_else/l1o82ir/) (in reply to ID ksh90wt):\nI’m currently also evaluating some platforms.. curious what you ended up deciding on?

We designed the SDK to be super easy to get started (just wrap your LLM calls in an \\`@opik.track\\` decorator), so it should take all of 5 minutes to take the free tier for a spin, even if you ultimately want to self-host.\n\nIf you have any questions, I'd be happy to assist.

The cloud version and open source version both have all of Opik's core functionality (evaluations, experiments, tracing/observability, datasets, etc.)  \n\nThe different features offered on the cloud side have more to do with things like:\n\n- User management\n- Flexible deployments\n- SLAs/Support\n\nAnd obviously, we handle all of the deployment infra for the cloud version. You also get access to Comet's experiment management platform via Opik's free tier, so if you're doing any model training/fine tuning, or looking to use Comet Artifacts for storage, that's an additional benefit of the cloud platform.\n\n## Comment ID mhqozor with +22 score by [(Ok-Cry5794, Reddit, 2025-03-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1jb1knr/why_the_heck_is_llm_observation_and_management/mhqozor/) (in reply to ID 1jb1knr):\nTake a look at MLflow tracing, **fully** open-source, **free*, and opentelemetry compatible.

For instrumentation, we’re built on OpenTelemetry, and we’ve also created a few dozen automatic instrumentors that capture everything you do with a particular library, along with the standard decorator instrumentation approach.\n\nHappy to help with any questions you have!

I do agree with you, some of those tools are a bit overpriced to what they do, it may justify scale but not for individual use...\n\nI've been working on [AiCore](https://github.com/BrunoV21/AiCore) which is my wrapper around multiple providers I use across my personal projects (no support for Anthropic yet sorry...) and one of the components I have been working on is an observability module which includes a collector which registers all the request information into a local JSON file and a PG dB if you provide a valid connection string as env var. It then integrates with a dashboard built on Dash for visualization. which includes tokens usage, latency, cost and a direct window into the local JSON or the PG dB (the code auto initializes the required tables on the dB).\n\nI am still working on this new release so there's no documentation yet and the dashboard needs some polishing (filters not working yet) but it should allow you to collect all the data you need[need](https://github.com/BrunoV21/AiCore/blob/main/aicore%2Fobservability%2Fcollector.py).\n\nI am hoping to have most of those issues and an updated resume by the end of the weekend haha.\n\nThe catch is that the observability modules only integrates into AiCore for now...\n\n### Comment ID mhqjgli with +1 score by [(smallroundcircle, Reddit, 2025-03-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1jb1knr/why_the_heck_is_llm_observation_and_management/mhqjgli/) (in reply to ID mhqi99m):\nThis is awesome, I’ll have a look :)\n\n## Comment ID mhqmkut with +2 score by [(phillipcarter2, Reddit, 2025-03-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1jb1knr/why_the_heck_is_llm_observation_and_management/mhqmkut/) (in reply to ID 1jb1knr):\nAll these tools assume you're using them for work, in which case your employer is going to foot the bill, and these prices are pretty cheap.\n\nThe real answer to your question is that observation tracking at scale is not cheap.

I suspect that for a smaller use case, the price of Langfuse is disproportionately expensive relative to the data, but their margins get worse as the scale goes up.\n\n## Comment ID mhv52rd with +2 score by [(Jey_Shiv, Reddit, 2025-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1jb1knr/why_the_heck_is_llm_observation_and_management/mhv52rd/) (in reply to ID 1jb1knr):\nHas anyone tried openllmetry with grafana or arize phoenix?\n\n### Comment ID mie4o2b with +2 score by [(AnyMessage6544, Reddit, 2025-03-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1jb1knr/why_the_heck_is_llm_observation_and_management/mie4o2b/) (in reply to ID mhv52rd):\nLow-key, OTel. + Arize Phoenix is a sleeper build\n\n## Comment ID mhqcnii with +1 score by [(hadoopfromscratch, Reddit, 2025-03-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1jb1knr/why_the_heck_is_llm_observation_and_management/mhqcnii/) (in reply to ID 1jb1knr):\nLitellm proxy?

Some examples include exact match, regex match, similarity score and json validation.\n\nSo for example if you were doing semantic classification of movie reviews to either \"positive\", \"negative\" or \"neutral\". You could set up a bunch of test cases and make sure you get an exact match response from the LLM. Or using regex you could add some variability, like make sure the word \"positive\" appears somewhere in the response etc.\n\nWith more creative completions like writing a blog post or article you could do similarity scores, where you set a predefined target response and then measure the similarity of the LLM completion to your target response. There are a few ways to measure similarity, one of which is doing a cosine similarity score where you vectorize each output (LLM completion and target completion) and then measure how similar they are.\n\nFor JSON validation, if you are expecting your completion to be in JSON format, you could check that it is valid JSON, or that overall the structure is correct or that certain keys are present etc.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more I wrote up a blog article about this here: [Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of AI Generated Prompt Responses](https://openshiro.com/articles/quantitative-and-qualitative-analysis-of-ai-generated-prompt-responses).\n\nI encountered this exact challenge myself when building an AI application so I built a developer tool suite for prompt engineering called [Shiro](https://openshiro.com/). You can use a platform like this to perform the tests, or you can use automated tests in whatever backend language you are working in. I wrote up an example here using [unittest in Python](https://openshiro.com/articles/prompt-engineering-testing-strategies-with-python) but you can do this with any automated testing suite, for example, I primarily use minitest in Ruby.\n\nEdit - fixing links and adding the unittest example.

There's a ton of hallucination detection research out there like [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05232) or [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16527) survey, so I wondered why aren't any of these providers offering more advanced research-backed methods? Given the user input query, retrieved context, and LLM output, one can pass this data to another LLM to evaluate whether the output is grounded in the context. So I benchmarked this LLM-as-a-Judge framework against a couple of research methods on the HaluBench dataset - and turns out they're probably right! A strong base model with chain-of-thought prompting seems to work better than various research methods. [Code here](https://github.com/liuzihe02/halu/tree/main).

      "# Post ID qz3qtv: [D] 5 considerations for Deploying Machine Learning Models in Production – what did I miss? with +68 score by [(mgalarny, Reddit, 2021-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qz3qtv/d_5_considerations_for_deploying_machine_learning/)\nI wrote a post about [considerations for deploying machine learning models in production.](https://towardsdatascience.com/considerations-for-deploying-machine-learning-models-in-production-89d38d96cc23) Below are the considerations. What did I not consider? I know the first consideration seems obvious, but I thought it was worth mentioning.\n\n**1. Use your laptop for development as a best practice**\n\nConsider your development environment first. Most data scientists or ML engineers invariably use their laptops for development, testing or debugging code. Because of simplicity, easy to access and install the latest ML libraries, practitioners overwhelmingly prefer laptops over clusters for development. We are spoiled by IDEs and syntax-highlighted editors for good reason.\n\nPython developers like to customize their environments to match their staging environment, with library dependencies using conda or Python virtual environments. Ideally, as a best practice, if the same code developed on their laptop can run with minimal changes on a staging or production environment on the cluster, it immensely improves the end-to-end developer productivity.\n\nConsider your laptop as a preferred choice of development environment, with the possibility of extending or syncing your code to the cluster environment in the cloud.\n\n*Consideration Number #1*: *Use your laptop for development as a best practice.*\n\n**2. Training at Scale and Tracking Model Experiments**\n\nUnlike the traditional software development cycle, the model development cycle paradigm is different. A number of factors influence an ML model’s success in production. First, the outcome of a model is measured by its metrics, such as an acceptable accuracy.\n\nSecond, achieving an accuracy that satisfies the business goal means experimentation with not only one model or ML library but many models and many ML libraries while tracking each experiment runs: metrics, parameters, artifacts, etc. As vital as accuracy is, so is a developer’s choice of ML libraries to experiment with.\n\nThird, accuracy is directly linked to the quality of acquired data: bad data results in a bad model.  Data preparation, feature extractions, feature selection, standardized/normalized features and data imputations/encoding are all imperative steps before the cleansed data lands into a feature store, accessible to your model training and testing phase or inference in deployment.\n\nFourth, a choice of programming language that is not only familiar to your data team — data analysts, data scientists, and ML engineers — but also supported by many ML libraries employed during model experimentation and training phases. Python seems to be the [de facto choice](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved).\n\nAlongside a choice of a programming language is the choice of an ML framework for taming compute-intensive ML workloads: deep learning, distributed training, hyperparameter optimization (HPO), and inference — all at horizontal scale — from your laptop, single node multiple cores to multiple nodes, with multiple cores.\n\nAnd finally, the ability to easily deploy models in diverse environments at scale: part of web applications, inside mobile devices, as a web service in the cloud, etc.\n\n*Consideration Number #2: Consider using model life cycle development and management platforms like* [*MLflow*](https://mlflow.org/)*,* [*DVC*](https://dvc.org/)*,* [*Valohai*](https://valohai.com/model-monitoring/)*,* [*Weights & Biases*](https://wandb.ai/site)*, or* [*SageMaker Studio*](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/)*. And* [*Ray*](https://www.ray.io/), [*Ray Tune*](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html)*,* [*Ray Train*](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/train/train.html) *(formerly Ray SGD),* [*PyTorch*](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dist_overview.html) *and* [*TensorFlow*](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training) *for distributed, compute-intensive and deep learning ML workloads.*\n\n**3. Managing Machine Learning Features**\n\n[Feature stores](https://www.featurestore.org/) are emerging pivotal components in the modern machine learning development cycle. As more data scientists and engineers work together to successfully put models in production, having a singular store to persist cleaned and featurized data is becoming an increasing necessity as part of the model development cycle.\n\nFeature stores address operational challenges. They provide a consistent set of data between training and inference. They avoid any data skew or inadvertent data leakage. They offer both customized capability of writing feature transformations, both on batch and streaming data, during the feature extraction process while training. And they allow request augmentation with historical data at inference, which is common in large fraud and anomaly detection deployed models or recommendation systems.\n\nAside from challenges and considerations of putting models in production, operationalizing ML data is equally important. Model accuracy depends on good data, and feature stores help manage precomputed and cleansed features for your model training and production inference during model serving.\n\n*Consideration Number #3: Consider feature stores as part of your model development process. Look to* [*Feast*](https://feast.dev/)*,* [*Tecton*](https://www.tecton.ai/)*,* [*SageMaker*](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/amazon_sagemaker_featurestore.html)*,* [Hopsworks](https://www.hopsworks.ai/feature-store), *and* [*Databricks*](https://databricks.com/product/feature-store) *for feature stores.*\n\n**4. Deploying, Serving and Inferencing Models at Scale**\n\nOnce the model is trained and tested, with confidence that it met the business requirements for model accuracy, seven crucial requirements for scalable model serving frameworks to consider are:\n\n**Framework agnostic**: A model serving-elected framework should be ML framework agnostic. That is, it can deploy any common model built with common ML frameworks. For example, PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, or Scikit-learn, each with its own algorithms and model architectures.\n\n**Business Logic:** Model prediction often requires preprocessing, post processing or ability to augment request data by connecting to a feature store or any other data store for validation. Model serving should allow this as part of its inference.\n\n**Model Replication:** Some models are compute-intensive or network-bound. As such the elected framework can fan out requests over to model replicas, load balancing among replicas to support parallel request handling during peak traffic.\n\n**Request Batching:** Not all models in production are employed for real-time serving. Often, models are scored in large batches of requests. For example, for deep learning models, parallelizing these image requests to multiple cores, taking advantage of hardware accelerators, to expedite batch scoring and utilize hardware resources is worthy of consideration.\n\n**High Concurrency and Low Latency:** Models in production require real-time inference with low latency while handling bursts of heavy traffic of requests. The consideration is crucial for best user experience to receive millisecond responses on prediction requests.\n\n**Model Deployment CLI and APIs:** A ML engineer responsible for deploying a model should be able to use model server’s deployment APIs or command line interfaces (CLI) simply to deploy model artifacts into production. This allows model deployment from within an existing CI/CD pipeline or workflow.\n\n**Patterns of Models in Production**: As ML applications are increasingly becoming pervasive in all sectors of industry, models trained for these ML applications are complex and composite. They range from computer vision to natural language processing to recommendation systems and reinforcement learning.\n\nThat is, models don’t exist in isolation. Nor do they predict results singularly. Instead they operate jointly and often in [four model patterns](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/serving-ml-models-in-production-common-patterns): pipeline, ensemble, business logic, and online learning. Each pattern has its purpose and merit.\n\nMachine Learning engineers adopt [two common approaches ](https://youtu.be/gV4YS4e1CXg?t=272)to deploy these patterns of models in production. One is to embed models into a web server and the other is to offload to an external service. Each approach has its own pros and cons, with respect to the seven considerations above.\n\n*Consideration Number #4: Look to* [*Seldon*](https://www.seldon.io/)*,* [*KFServing*](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/kfserving/)*, or* [*Ray Serve*](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html) *for all these seven requirements.*\n\n**5. Observing and Monitoring Model in Production**\n\nModel monitoring, often an overlooked stage as part of model development lifecycle, is critical to model’s viability in the post deployment production stage. It is often an afterthought, at an ML engineer’s peril.\n\nModels have an afterlife of viability. That viable life in production needs a constant watchful or sentinel eye. In fact, monitoring as a phase is simply a continuation of the model serving.\n\nWhy consider model monitoring? For a number of practical reasons, this stage is pivotal. Let’s briefly discuss them.\n\nData drifts over time\\*\\*:\\*\\* As we mentioned above, our quality and accuracy of the model depends on the quality of the data. Data is complex and never static, meaning what the original model was trained with the extracted features may not be as important over time. Some new features may emerge that need to be taken into account. For example, seasonal data changes. Such [features drifts](https://evidentlyai.com/blog/machine-learning-monitoring-data-and-concept-drift) in data require retraining and redeploying the model, because the distribution of the variables is no longer relevant.\n\nModel concept changes over time\\*\\*:\\*\\* Many practitioners refer to this as model [decay or model staleness](https://evidentlyai.com/blog/machine-learning-monitoring-data-and-concept-drift). When the patterns of trained models no longer hold with the drifting data, the model is no longer valid because the relationships of its input features may not necessarily produce the model’s expected prediction. Hence, its accuracy degrades.\n\nModels fail over time\\*\\*:\\*\\* Models fail for inexplicable reasons: a system failure or bad network connection; an overloaded system; a bad input or corrupted request. Detecting these failures’ root causes early or its frequency mitigates user bad experience or deters mistrust in the service if the user receives wrong or bogus outcomes.\n\nSystems degrade over load\\*\\*:\\*\\* Constantly being vigilant of the health of your dedicated model servers or services deployed is just as important as monitoring the health of your data pipelines that transform data or your entire data infrastructure’s key components: data stores, web servers, routers, cluster nodes’ system health, etc.\n\nCollectively, these aforementioned monitoring model concepts are called [model observability](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-ml-observability-29e85e701688). This step is now an acceptable imperative in [MLOps best practices](https://towardsdatascience.com/mlops-practices-for-data-scientists-dbb01be45dd8). Monitoring the health of your data and models should never be an afterthought. Rather, it ought to be part and parcel of your model development cycle.\n\n*Consideration Number #5: For model observability look to* [*Evidently.ai*](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently)*,* [*Arize.ai*](https://arize.com/)*,* [*Arthur.ai*](https://www.arthur.ai/), [*Fiddler.ai*](https://www.fiddler.ai/), *or* [*whylabs.ai*](https://whylabs.ai/)*.*\n\n*Thanks to this* [excellent PyTorch reddit post for inspiring](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/kvs1ex/d_here_are_17_ways_of_making_pytorch_training/) the formatting of this post\\*.\\*\n\n## Comment ID hlk7xau with +25 score by [(Charming-Fishing3155, Reddit, 2021-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qz3qtv/d_5_considerations_for_deploying_machine_learning/hlk7xau/) (in reply to ID qz3qtv):\nSo:\n\n1. You do not need feature store, unless your model depends on real time feature values , I.e. values that occurred after the model was trained. Those are usually relate to time based information.\n2. You missed model fairness and bias measurements. \n3. You missed progressive deployment. Usually models are deployed in shadow mode or canary mode. This way you can compare the new model to the old model, before promotion.\n4. I would also recommend having some sort of a CD pipeline, such that the models are tested in production like env (e.g. staging) before placing them in production.\n5. Within the CI/CD you should design ML specific unit tests.\n6. Regarding monitoring, you should also monitor you data sources - e.g. general data quality, as well as latency, health, etc. \n7. You should have a mechanism such that models can be rolled back to previous versions.\n8. Note that there are two kinds of productions: real time and batch. Depending on your use case, you might want to consider your points as they relate to the batch use case.\n\n### Comment ID hlm929f with +3 score by [(LSTMeow, Reddit, 2021-11-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qz3qtv/d_5_considerations_for_deploying_machine_learning/hlm929f/) (in reply to ID hlk7xau):\nGreat response!

If running on the laptop is really the fastest way for you fine but if you find yourself waiting on data load or training runs then you'll save time long run by learning to do cloud first development.\n\n(FWIW i've been at my current job 5 months and don't have a dev environment on my laptop setup.

Also most companies do not want sensitive data on laptops as it poses a security risk and/or voids contractual obligations.\n\n## Comment ID hlk06ed with +3 score by [(LSTMeow, Reddit, 2021-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qz3qtv/d_5_considerations_for_deploying_machine_learning/hlk06ed/) (in reply to ID qz3qtv):\nPlease x-post to r/mlops (disclamer: mod)\n\nThis content is a great match\n\n### Comment ID hlk2gwf with +2 score by [(mgalarny, Reddit, 2021-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qz3qtv/d_5_considerations_for_deploying_machine_learning/hlk2gwf/) (in reply to ID hlk06ed):\nx-posted! https://www.reddit.com/r/mlops/comments/qz4f0p/5\\_considerations\\_for\\_deploying\\_machine\\_learning/\n\nHopefully there are some good comments on that post!\n\n## Comment ID hlmdox3 with +3 score by [(scottire, Reddit, 2021-11-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qz3qtv/d_5_considerations_for_deploying_machine_learning/hlmdox3/) (in reply to ID qz3qtv):\nThanks for giving Weights & Biases a shoutout!\n\nOne thing you touched on that is a major consideration is how you evaluate your model for production readiness. \n\nYou should test your model, the data, the training and evaluation pipeline, etc. For example, you want to track how your model predictions change over time and check them on different splits of the data (a W&B tool for this is [W&B Tables](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/data-vis/tables)).\n\nHere’s a good paper from google that gives a points based rubric to calculate how production ready your models are.\nhttps://research.google/pubs/pub45742/\n\n### Comment ID hlo2in0 with +1 score by [(mgalarny, Reddit, 2021-11-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qz3qtv/d_5_considerations_for_deploying_machine_learning/hlo2in0/) (in reply to ID hlmdox3):\nThanks for the points!

Couple of comments.  Valohai is first-and-foremost experiment tracking. Why did you leave out the Hopsworks Feature Store (disclaimer: i work on it).\n\n### Comment ID hlk5kkl with +2 score by [(mgalarny, Reddit, 2021-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qz3qtv/d_5_considerations_for_deploying_machine_learning/hlk5kkl/) (in reply to ID hlk38nj):\nHonestly Hopsworks didn't come up immediately in google search. Added it in and will modify the blog post based on all the comments in this reddit thread (when comments stop coming). Thanks! Moved Valohai to experiment tracking.\n\n## Comment ID hllhyuh with +2 score by [(ktpr, Reddit, 2021-11-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qz3qtv/d_5_considerations_for_deploying_machine_learning/hllhyuh/) (in reply to ID qz3qtv):\nIn production, as you presented it, you’re assuming changes can be tracked within a sequential one after the other monitoring loop.\n\nBut it is well known that data can have bias and other data/process non linear feedback loops can exist. Non linear feedback loops, at minimize, suggest a non-sequential monitoring loop. \n\nOne example of non-sequential monitoring would be pairwise monitoring between all considerations.\n\n### Comment ID hllrxhh with +1 score by [(Ok_can_you_improve, Reddit, 2021-11-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qz3qtv/d_5_considerations_for_deploying_machine_learning/hllrxhh/) (in reply to ID hllhyuh):\nIs there any theory behind the connection between feedback loops and monitoring loops?\n\n## Comment ID j632nqb with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qz3qtv/d_5_considerations_for_deploying_machine_learning/j632nqb/) (in reply to ID qz3qtv):\nI would also add monitoring of Edge cases.   \n\n\nMany times, users start using these deployed ML models in ways which weren't anticipated or had very low representation in the original training dataset.   \n\n\nIn my experience, having a data refinement loop where you keep on identifying and collecting such edge cases following by model retraining goes a long way in improving the accuracy of the model over time.   \n\n\nI am building an open-source project which helps to do the same. Happy to share more details if interested.\n\n## Comment ID hll6ey6 with +1 score by [(hiptobecubic, Reddit, 2021-11-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qz3qtv/d_5_considerations_for_deploying_machine_learning/hll6ey6/) (in reply to ID qz3qtv):\nStep one is to read and do the standard advice given by literally guide on reliable software deployment. \"Mlops\" is somehow years behind regular ops on some really basic concepts like canarying and monitoring.\n\n### Comment ID hlo99jd with +1 score by [(Nice_Bicycle6994, Reddit, 2021-11-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qz3qtv/d_5_considerations_for_deploying_machine_learning/hlo99jd/) (in reply to ID hll6ey6):\nYes, indeed, MLops is still a nascent and emerging discipline. We are not at par with DevOps is for software. I look at MLops = Data Ops + Model Ops + Dev Ops.\n\n#### Comment ID hlwcxl3 with +1 score by [(hiptobecubic, Reddit, 2021-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qz3qtv/d_5_considerations_for_deploying_machine_learning/hlwcxl3/) (in reply to ID hlo99jd):\nMy point is that by renaming it mlops, everyone seems to think it's a new field and is ignoring the existing wisdom. It reminds me of how \"big data\" systems had to relearn the importance of constant factors from scratch when comparing algorithms. We already knew a lot about what makes programs fast (beyond just big O) and it mostly went out the window when Hadoop was born. Now, after many years, it is becoming accepted wisdom again that e.g. io caching by the filesystem is hard to beat and \"crappy\" tools like gnu parallel work awesomely until you get to the kind of scale you can't afford to store anyway."

People are accountable, creative, and driven to push themselves everyday. The energy is unlike anything I've seen before and it is infectious. Probably one of the best crews I've ever had to pleasure to work with. Ever.\n- The technical work is challenging. After almost 10 years in this field, I thought I had learned it all. I learned quickly that this was not the case after a few weeks here. \n- Freedom to make decisions. The org is extremely flat and process-less by design. This frees up engineers to do what they do best -- build stuff -- without much of the other stuff that gets in the way.\n- High quality bar. Despite how fast things move, the team has maintained a very high quality bar for what we ship.",

      "# [Building Audio Support with OpenAI: Insights from our Journey by Sally-Ann DeLucia on 2025-01-22](https://arize.com/blog/building-audio-support-with-openai-insights-from-our-journey/)\nIntroduction\n\nIn early October last year, OpenAI launched the beta version of their Realtime API, which introduced an incredible feature: the ability to process audio as both input and output in a low latency environment. And when I say process audio, I don’t just mean converting it to text and passing it to an LLM—the GPT model actually handles raw audio bytes directly. That’s a fairly novel capability, and OpenAI’s implementation is lightning-fast. It even supports Voice Activity Detection (VAD), allowing the API to seamlessly handle real-time adjustments, interruptions, and subsequent requests. Think of it like Siri or Alexa, but far more advanced. Integrated with the right tools and setup, it’s on a completely different level. While intimidating at first, once configured, it quickly becomes clear this API is far beyond what you’d expect from a beta release.\n\nAudio is a remarkably powerful modality, opening doors to LLM applications that go beyond traditional text-based interactions. By incorporating audio, applications can enable richer, multimodal experiences in areas like language learning, virtual assistants, customer support, and more. Recognizing this potential, we knew we had to bring audio support into Arize. As more applications adopt audio, they’ll need robust observability and evaluation tools to ensure quality and performance.\n\nIn this blog, I’ll walk you through what we learned while building audio support—sharing key lessons so you don’t have to learn them the hard way. Let’s begin by diving into the technology.\n\nWhat Is the OpenAI Realtime API?\n\nThe OpenAI Realtime API enables teams to create low-latency, multimodal conversational applications with voice-enabled models. These models support real-time text and audio inputs and outputs, voice activity detection, function calling, and much more. But what exactly makes the Realtime API special? Let’s dive in.\n\nFirst off, it’s really fast. The API offers low-latency streaming, which is essential for smooth and engaging conversational experiences. It also brings advanced voice capabilities to the table. You can adjust the tone, include natural-sounding laughs or whispers, and even provide tonal direction—all while keeping the responses sounding incredibly natural. On top of that, the Realtime API supports function calling, which is a game-changer for building agents capable of handling complex, real-world tasks.\n\nSo how does all of this work? The Realtime API leverages WebSockets, which enable a persistent, bi-directional communication channel between the client (your application) and the server (OpenAI). This means data can flow continuously in both directions, allowing for seamless conversational exchanges. Unlike traditional HTTP, where each request needs its own connection, WebSockets keep the line open, letting the client and server send messages independently of each other.\n\nThis constant exchange of events is the backbone of the API. Events track what the system is doing and reflect the current state of your application. Whether you’re streaming responses or managing real-time function calls, events give you the insight and control needed to create dynamic and responsive applications. They’re also crucial for tracing your application to Arize.\n\nNavigating Events and Audio Complexity: Key Challenges\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, setting up the Realtime API can feel overwhelming, especially if you’re not familiar with WebSockets or audio data. My first piece of advice: start with OpenAI’s Realtime console. It’s an excellent way to see just how impressive this technology is while also getting hands-on experience with how events move back and forth. This helps you build intuition for which events are critical for your application. However, be prepared—there are a lot of events.\n\nTo truly understand the challenges and nuances of integrating the Realtime API, we decided to build a toy application from scratch. This hands-on approach wasn’t just for fun—it was a deliberate effort to deeply study how the API works and identify potential pain points that developers might face. By doing so, we gained insights that ultimately shaped the platform support we now offer. For instance, experimenting with event structures and state management in a low-stakes environment helped us understand what the events were that really mattered, as well as the API’s capabilities and limitations. If you’re just starting, I highly recommend trying something similar to solidify your foundation.\n\nOne major challenge we had: we needed to keep meticulous track of state. A single request-response cycle can generate upwards of 100 events, and we needed to aggregate a significant amount of events to get all the data we needed. If your application isn’t tracking state properly, you risk missing critical information, which could impact the quality of responses. This is also important because, due to the nature of WebSockets, the API might send a partial response before completing a tool call. While this is rare, it’s something to be aware of.\n\nAudio data adds another layer of complexity. For those new to audio processing, this shift can be daunting. Unlike structured formats like JSON or DataFrames, audio signals are continuous and high-dimensional, requiring significant storage and computational power. Managing large audio datasets introduces challenges not typically encountered with more standardized data types.\n\nAdditionally, audio files come in various formats, like WAV and MP3, each with its own sample rates and bit depths. Ensuring compatibility with the Realtime API means you’ll need to handle these formats carefully. For instance, while developing our evaluation package, we learned that when sending a base64-encoded audio string to OpenAI, the correct file format (e.g., WAV or MP3) must be explicitly specified. If a file’s extension is missing or unreliable, implementing validation mechanisms becomes essential. This might involve checking specific byte patterns at the beginning of the file to accurately determine its format.\n\nHow We Built Audio Evaluation Support Lessons Learned\n\nWhen we set out to support voice applications in Arize, we knew evaluations would play a central role. This gave us a unique opportunity to push the limits of what the model could achieve in audio evaluations. We focused on two critical areas to start: emotion detection and intent recognition.\n\nEmotion is key because it provides insight into how users interact with applications. Are users confused, frustrated, or happy? Knowing this can be incredibly valuable for improving user experiences. Emotion detection, paired with regular evaluations, offers a window into how applications respond to users’ needs. For instance, the ability to control audio output means you can assess whether your application is responding inappropriately—like sounding angry or dismissive—so you can address it.\n\nIntent recognition is equally important for understanding how well the API interprets user requests. This helps determine whether the application made the right decision to address a query. For example, if your application uses multiple tools, intent detection can ensure the right tool was called—or identify gaps where new tools are needed. With these two focus areas in mind, we began benchmarking and building our evaluation package.\n\nOne early realization was that we didn’t need to use the Realtime API for evaluations. Realtime capabilities, like low-latency voice activity detection (VAD), are essential for conversational experiences like support or call center applications. For evaluations, however, low latency wasn’t a requirement. Instead, we opted for the chat completions API, which is also audio-enabled. Making the call is straightforward—just send the audio and text in separate messages. Simple enough.\n\ncompletion = client.chat.completions.create( model=\"gpt-4o-audio-preview\", modalities=[\"text\", \"audio\"], audio={\"voice\": \"alloy\", \"format\": \"wav\"}, messages=[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"What is in this recording?\" }, { \"type\": \"input_audio\", \"input_audio\": { \"data\": encoded_string, \"format\": \"wav\" } } ] }, ] )\n\nBenchmarking: The Highs and Lows\n\nIf we were going to publish evaluation templates, we needed to benchmark them thoroughly. Recommending a template without ensuring its performance wasn’t an option. Here’s what we found:\n\nIntent Recognition\n\nIntent recognition was a breeze. GPT-4 handled it effortlessly, delivering excellent results right out of the gate. While we opted not to release a single intent template (because intents vary widely across use cases), we included a skeleton template in our cookbook for users to build upon.\n\nEmotion Detection\n\nEmotion detection, however, was another story. OpenAI claimed the model could interpret nuanced emotions in audio, so I had high hopes. I started with well-known emotion detection datasets like RAVDESS and CREMA-D, both of which feature controlled, actor-generated audio with golden labels. But the results were dismal—about 1% accuracy. I couldn’t believe it.\n\nI iterated on the prompt, adding more detailed instructions and refining the format. No improvement. I moved to another dataset, rinsed and repeated. Still nothing. Frustration mounted as I noticed the model defaulting to “neutral” most of the time. Why? I began to suspect the issue was the datasets themselves.\n\nRAVDESS and CREMA-D are highly controlled and exaggerated, with short, scripted sentences—scenarios that don’t align well with GPT’s strengths. Switching to the IEMOCAP (labels / data) dataset was a game-changer. This dataset features more natural conversations, closely mirroring GPT’s capabilities in understanding nuanced, real-world language. The results? A dramatic improvement in accuracy. This experience was a valuable reminder: models like GPT aren’t magic—they excel in natural, conversational contexts but may struggle with artificially constrained tasks.\n\nCrafting Multimodal Prompt Templates\n\nOne unique challenge with audio evaluations was constructing multimodal prompt templates. Unlike text-based evaluations, where prompts are a single template with variable placeholders, audio requires a different approach. The audio must be sent as a separate message, alongside task guidelines and response instructions.\n\nWe experimented with several layering techniques for these templates. Ultimately, the best approach was to “sandwich” the audio between the task instructions and response expectations. This structure worked well for evaluations and for general use of the chat completions API with audio. If you’re developing with this API, keep in mind the need to treat audio as a distinct input.\n\nConclusion\n\nBuilding audio-enabled applications presents a unique set of challenges, from understanding event flows and managing complex audio data, to crafting effective multimodal templates. These experiences have taught us valuable lessons about the nuances of realtime APIs, the importance of proper state management, and the complexities of working with high-dimensional data like audio.\n\nFortunately, tools like Arize are here to help you with your own journey.

      "# [Arize AI hopes it has first-mover advantage in AI observability by Rebecca Szkutak on 2025-02-20](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/arize-ai-hopes-it-has-first-mover-advantage-in-ai-observability/)\nThere are numerous observability platforms that monitor and evaluate cloud software, like Dynatrace and ServiceNow, which flag potential code errors or failures so engineers can find and fix them. Arize AI says it is bringing that same approach to AI models and applications.\n\nArize is an AI observability platform that helps companies evaluate their AI products as they are building them and then monitor those products for errors and issues once they are up and running. Arize’s platform works with a variety of AI applications, from machine learning and computer vision to generative AI.\n\nJason Lopatecki, Arize co-founder and CEO (pictured above, left), told TechCrunch that Arize uses a “council of judges” approach to monitor and evaluate AI. This approach includes evaluating AI with different AI models — which Lopatecki joked is, yes, very meta — in addition to having humans in the loop.\n\nThe idea behind Arize came from Lopatecki’s previous company, TubeMogul, a brand advertising company, which was acquired by Adobe for over $500 million in 2016.\n\nEverything at TubeMogul ran on AI, Lopatecki said, and when it would break it would be a “big deal” since the technology was so complicated. Aparna Dhinakaran, a co-founder and CPO at Arize (pictured above, right), who met Lopatecki through TubeMogul, had run into similar issues developing language models without having the proper tools to test and evaluate as she built.\n\n“We both saw the problem space and really had that idea that AI is going to be high stakes in more and more organizations everywhere,” Lopatecki said. “It’s so complicated, it’s really hard to tell what it’s doing, when it’s broken and how to fix it.”\n\nThe pair launched Arize in 2020 with an initial focus on the AI trend of the day: predictive machine learning. Lopatecki said that when Arize got started, it was really just an idea. Today, five years later, the market gets the problem and Arize’s platform works with everything from AI agents to generative AI.\n\n“So the last two years have been, I would say, explosive, explosive in growth,” Lopatecki said. “Simply because [AI] is more accessible. Everyone’s a prompt engineer. Every engineer is a prompt engineer. Everyone is integrating [AI] products into their product lines.”\n\nArize now works with enterprises including Uber, Klaviyo, and Tripadvisor, among others. The company also has an open source offering, Arize Phoenix, which has more than two million monthly downloads.\n\nThe Berkeley, California-based company recently raised a $70 million Series C round led by Adams Street Partners with participation from M12, SineWave Ventures, and OMERS Ventures, among other investors, in addition to strategic backers including Datadog and PagerDuty. This brings the company’s total funding to more than $130 million to date.\n\nThe company plans to put its latest round of funding toward improving its main product and doubling down on growing AI segments, including voice and AI agents. Dhinakaran joked that while their open source product may be their biggest competitor, the company plans to put more money into developing that product, too.\n\n“Our open source Phoenix has just been growing, it’s been growing massively, and so I think we love that. We love open source,” Dhinakaran said.\n\nThe AI observability and evaluation space is becoming increasingly crowded. Dhinakaran said that they think that Arize offers both pre- and post-launch evaluations, and can be used across a variety of different AI applications, which helps the company stand out; although, there are companies with very similar offerings, like Galileo, which has raised $68 million in venture funding, and Patronus AI, which has raised $20 million in funding.\n\n“It’s so hard to build the [infrastructure] to do this, right?” Lopatecki said. “It’s kind of why I think the Microsofts and Datadogs are investing in us, or making a bet on us. I think people also now see how big this market can be. You’re going to have a lot of little guys. You’re gonna have big people jumping in it, and I expect it to be a fast, growing, large market.”\n\nThis piece has been updated to better reflect when Arize was founded.",

It’s a critical step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and plays a key role in AI agent capabilities.\n\nHow DeepSeek’s Models Work\n\nDeepSeek R.1.0 was trained without human input using reinforcement learning alone. Instead of relying on human annotations, the model was rewarded for:\n\nAccuracy – Correct answers received higher scores.\n\nFormatting – The model was guided toward structured reasoning, leading to the emergence of “thinking brackets”, a structured way to show its work.\n\nOne fascinating discovery: DeepSeek R.1.0 self-corrected its reasoning process, showing “Aha moments” where it adjusted its thought process mid-generation—a behavior not seen in earlier models.\n\nTo address R.1.0’s language inconsistency, DeepSeek R.1 introduced:\n\nSupervised fine-tuning – The model was trained on high-quality, human-annotated data before reinforcement learning.\n\nImproved readability – Ensured responses were formatted clearly and remained in one language.\n\nWhile DeepSeek R.1 is more readable, it traded off some benchmark performance where R.1.0’s mixed-language approach had an advantage.\n\nTo make DeepSeek more accessible, the team distilled the massive R.1 model into a smaller, more efficient version.\n\nSize Reduction – The original 67-billion-parameter model was distilled into a 1.5-billion-parameter version.\n\nLocal Demo – A Streamlit app demonstrated DeepSeek running locally on an M3 Mac, showcasing its ability to solve math problems with detailed reasoning.\n\nLatency and Performance:\n\nThe 14-billion-parameter model was powerful but slow.\n\nThe 1.5-billion-parameter model was faster and more efficient, making it ideal for local deployment where speed and resource efficiency matter.\n\nWhy Run AI Locally?\n\nPrivacy – No need to send data to the cloud.\n\nCustomization – Fine-tune models for specific tasks.\n\nHardware Constraints – Ensures models fit within available system resources.\n\nUse Cases and Considerations\n\nDeepSeek’s models are still in the early stages of real-world adoption, but potential applications include:\n\nEnterprise AI – Some companies are testing DeepSeek models for production use.\n\nPrompt Engineering – Switching models may require refining prompts for optimal performance.\n\nPrivacy-Focused AI – DeepSeek’s models offer an alternative for those who need full control over their AI stack.\n\nTraditional ML Tasks – The 1.5-billion-parameter model works well for sentiment analysis and topic modeling.\n\nAI Agents & Tool Use – While the smaller models aren’t ideal for tool-calling, larger models might be better suited.\n\nFinal Thoughts: What Makes DeepSeek Unique?\n\nBeyond performance, DeepSeek models have a distinct personality—offering a different experience compared to traditional cloud-based LLMs. Whether you need a reasoning powerhouse or a lightweight local model, DeepSeek’s innovative approach to reinforcement learning is pushing the boundaries of AI development.",
      "# [Summarization on 2024-07-09](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/datasets-and-experiments/use-cases-datasets/summarization)\nImagine you're deploying a service for your media company's summarization model that condenses daily news into concise summaries to be displayed online. One challenge of using LLMs for summarization is that even the best models tend to be verbose.\n\nIn this tutorial, you will construct a dataset and run experiments to engineer a prompt template that produces concise yet accurate summaries. You will:\n\nUpload a dataset of examples containing articles and human-written reference summaries to Phoenix\n\nDefine an experiment task that summarizes a news article\n\nDevise evaluators for length and ROUGE score\n\nRun experiments to iterate on your prompt template and to compare the summaries produced by different LLMs\n\n⚠️ This tutorial requires and OpenAI API key, and optionally, an Anthropic API key.\n\nLet's get started!\n\nInstall Dependencies and Import Libraries\n\nInstall requirements and import libraries.\n\nLaunch Phoenix\n\nLaunch Phoenix and follow the instructions in the cell output to open the Phoenix UI.\n\nInstrument Your Application\n\nCreate Your Dataset\n\nDownload your from HuggingFace and inspect a random sample of ten rows. This dataset contains news articles and human-written summaries that we will use as a reference against which to compare our LLM generated summaries.\n\nUpload the data as a dataset in Phoenix and follow the link in the cell output to inspect the individual examples of the dataset. Later in the notebook, you will run experiments over this dataset in order to iteratively improve your summarization application.\n\nDefine Your Experiment Task\n\nA task is a callable that maps the input of a dataset example to an output by invoking a chain, query engine, or LLM. An experiment maps a task across all the examples in a dataset and optionally executes evaluators to grade the task outputs.\n\nYou'll start by defining your task, which in this case, invokes OpenAI. First, set your OpenAI API key if it is not already present as an environment variable.\n\nNext, define a function to format a prompt template and invoke an OpenAI model on an example.\n\nFrom this function, you can use functools.partial to derive your first task, which is a callable that takes in an example and returns an output. Test out your task by invoking it on the test example.\n\nDefine Your Evaluators\n\nEvaluators take the output of a task (in this case, a string) and grade it, often with the help of an LLM. In your case, you will create ROUGE score evaluators to compare the LLM-generated summaries with the human reference summaries you uploaded as part of your dataset. There are several variants of ROUGE, but we'll use ROUGE-1 for simplicity:\n\nROUGE-1 precision is the proportion of overlapping tokens (present in both reference and generated summaries) that are present in the generated summary (number of overlapping tokens / number of tokens in the generated summary)\n\nROUGE-1 recall is the proportion of overlapping tokens that are present in the reference summary (number of overlapping tokens / number of tokens in the reference summary)\n\nROUGE-1 F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single number that balances these two scores.\n\nHigher ROUGE scores mean that a generated summary is more similar to the corresponding reference summary. Scores near 1 / 2 are considered excellent, and a .\n\nSince we also care about conciseness, you'll also define an evaluator to count the number of tokens in each generated summary.\n\nNote that you can use any third-party library you like while defining evaluators (in your case, rouge and tiktoken).\n\nRun Experiments and Iterate on Your Prompt Template\n\nRun your first experiment and follow the link in the cell output to inspect the task outputs (generated summaries) and evaluations.\n\nOur initial prompt template contained little guidance. It resulted in an ROUGE-1 F1-score just above 0.3 (this will vary from run to run). Inspecting the task outputs of the experiment, you'll also notice that the generated summaries are far more verbose than the reference summaries. This results in high ROUGE-1 recall and low ROUGE-1 precision. Let's see if we can improve our prompt to make our summaries more concise and to balance out those recall and precision scores while maintaining or improving F1. We'll start by explicitly instructing the LLM to produce a concise summary.\n\nInspecting the experiment results, you'll notice that the average num_tokens has indeed increased, but the generated summaries are still far more verbose than the reference summaries.\n\nInstead of just instructing the LLM to produce concise summaries, let's use a few-shot prompt to show it examples of articles and good summaries. The cell below includes a few articles and reference summaries in an updated prompt template.\n\nNow run the experiment.\n\nBy including examples in the prompt, you'll notice a steep decline in the number of tokens per summary while maintaining F1.\n\nCompare With Another Model (Optional)\n\n⚠️ This section requires an Anthropic API key.\n\nNow that you have a prompt template that is performing reasonably well, you can compare the performance of other models on this particular task. Anthropic's Claude is notable for producing concise and to-the-point output.\n\nFirst, enter your Anthropic API key if it is not already present.\n\nNext, define a new task that summarizes articles using the same prompt template as before. Then, run the experiment.\n\nIf your experiment does not produce more concise summaries, inspect the individual results. You may notice that some summaries from Claude 3.5 Sonnet start with a preamble such as:\n\nSee if you can tweak the prompt and re-run the experiment to exclude this preamble from Claude's output. Doing so should result in the most concise summaries yet.\n\nSynopsis and Next Steps\n\nCongrats! In this tutorial, you have:\n\nCreated a Phoenix dataset\n\nDefined an experimental task and custom evaluators\n\nIteratively improved a prompt template to produce more concise summaries with balanced ROUGE-1 precision and recall\n\nAs next steps, you can continue to iterate on your prompt template. If you find that you are unable to improve your summaries with further prompt engineering, you can export your dataset from Phoenix and use the to train a bespoke model for your needs.",
      "# [Using Annotations To Collect Human Feedback On LLM Apps by Steve Herzog on 2024-08-15](https://phoenix.arize.com/how-to-use-annotations-to-collect-human-feedback-on-your-llm-application/)\nLiking Phoenix? Please consider giving us a ⭐ on Github!\n\nCast your mind back to the early days of mainstream AI development – a whopping seven years ago. NVIDIA stock was just over $1 per share. “Transformers” meant Optimus Prime, not a word-changing technical leap forward. And the primary way of evaluating AI applications was collecting manual human feedback.\n\nSince those days, programmatic and LLM-based evaluations have been commonplace and we’ve drastically reduced our reliance on human-labelers. Simultaneously however, the rise of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has popularized new systems of collecting human feedback en masse.\n\nWhether you’re looking to hand-label your data to weed out especially subtle response variations, curate the perfect set of examples for few-shot prompting, or log real-time user feedback from your live app, a robust system for capturing and cataloging human annotations is critical.\n\nLet’s take a look at how our latest update to Phoenix allows you to do just that.\n\nAnnotations\n\nAnnotations make it simple to add human feedback to spans and traces in your LLM applications. Annotations can be added via the Phoenix UI or through our SDKs or API.\n\nTo keep our UI clean and easy to use, we’ve now grouped human annotations and our existing evaluations into a new column called “Feedback.” Annotations and evaluations in this section will be rolled up into top-level metrics within Phoenix, and can be used to filter spans and traces in the UI or programmatically.\n\nCreating Datasets Using Annotations\n\nAnnotations also work extremely well with the Datasets feature we launched last month. Want to create a dataset of all the 👍captured in your application to fine-tune your model?\n\nSimply filter on that annotation, select all rows, then add them to a dataset:\n\nThen export your new dataset to examine further or power your fine-tuning flywheel.\n\nHow To: Log Annotations in the UI\n\nLogging annotations in the Phoenix UI is as simple as selecting your trace, then selecting the “Annotate” button on the top right.\n\nHow To: Log Annotations Programmatically\n\nYou can log annotations programmatically by sending a request to https://app.phoenix.arize.com/v1/span_annotations (NOTE: If you are self-hosting Phoenix, replace app.phoenix.arize.com with your Phoenix base url). If you’re not using our Python SDK, make sure you set “PHOENIX_CLIENT_HEADERS” = “api_key=…” as a request header.\n\nThis endpoint takes the following parameters in the request body:\n\n{ \"span_id\": \"67f6740bbe1ddc3f\", # the id of the span you want to attach the annotation to \"name\": \"correctness\", # the name of your annotation \"annotator_kind\": \"HUMAN\", # either HUMAN or LLM \"result\": { \"label\": \"correct\", # the text value of your annotation \"score\": 1, # a score associated with your annotation \"explanation\": \"it is correct\" # the explanation behind your annotation }, }\n\nCollecting the span_id value is the only potentially tricky part here. If you’re using our Python or TS SDKs, you can query for the current span:\n\nfrom opentelemetry import trace span = trace.get_current_span() span_id = span.get_span_context().span_id.to_bytes(8, \"big\").hex()\n\nimport { trace } from \"@opentelemetry/api\"; async function chat(req, res) { // ... const spanId = trace.getActiveSpan()?.spanContext().spanId; }\n\nIf you’re trying to log annotations from a backend application, you need to persist the span_id on your own. Here’s a diagram of what this type of architecture often looks like:\n\nThe span_id is retrieved during the initial generation phase, then attached to the response sent to the frontend. If the user then eventually provides feedback, the span id is sent along with that feedback to the backend system to be logged.\n\nAnd You’re Off!\n\nWith that, you can now log human feedback into Phoenix. If you run into issues, check out the resources below, or jump into our Slack channel to ask a question.\n\nHuman feedback in Phoenix transforms how you evaluate and improve LLM apps. By combining automated metrics with human insights, you can create models that not only perform well but also resonate with users.\n\nWe can’t wait to see what you build!\n\nResources\n\nAdditional helpful references:",

Traditional observability solutions are designed to collect infrastructure-level metrics or application-level performance. However, they lack the capabilities to provide visibility into the unique challenges of predictive ML and genAI models, which include:\n\nLack of Visibility in GenAI: Generative models, such as large language models (LLM), are non-deterministic, meaning their outputs can vary unpredictably even with the same input, making error diagnosis and decision interpretation difficult.\n\nEvolving Complexity: AI workflows are growing in sophistication and now involve agents, retrieval-augmented generation, knowledge graphs, tool usage, and function calling, creating intricate dependencies that must be traced and evaluated effectively.\n\nModel Drift and Performance Degradation: AI models often degrade over time due to shifts in input data or retraining updates, requiring continuous monitoring to detect and refine performance issues.\n\nModel Sprawl: Enterprises manage numerous AI models across predictive ML, vision, and LLMs, making manual tracking of performance, drift, and hallucinations impractical without a unified observability solution.\n\nArize AI: The Purpose-Built AI Observability Solution\n\nFounded in 2020 by a team of AI infrastructure veterans, Arize AI initially found product-market fit by addressing the critical pain points of ML engineers, providing solutions for traditional ML pitfalls such as model drift, performance degradation, and labeling errors.\n\nShortly after the launch of ChatGPT, Arize AI recognized the transformative potential of genAI and expanded its platform to address the emerging needs of LLM systems. Notably, Arize AI introduced Phoenix, the first open-source LLM evaluation framework, along with a comprehensive suite of production-grade LLM observability solutions. With over 4,600 Github stars and 6000+ active community members, Phoenix has gained widespread adoption among developers and is becoming the de-facto standard for LLM tracing and evaluation.\n\nToday, Arize AI is a fully unified AI/ML observability platform that provides a single “pane of glass” for AI engineers to debug and monitor all their models with intuitive dashboards and automated insights. The Arize AI platform enables AI/ML teams to seamlessly transition from experimentation to deployment, ensuring end-to-end visibility and rapid resolution of issues. These observability capabilities ensure that AI engineers can identify and address performance, fairness, or reliability issues in real time.\n\nExperienced Leadership with a Strong Track Record\n\nArize AI is led by an exceptional team with deep AI and enterprise software expertise. CEO Jason Lopatecki previously spearheaded AI strategy at TubeMogul, bringing hands-on experience in scaling AI-driven businesses. Co-founder and chief product officer Aparna Dhinakaran honed her AI expertise at Apple and then Uber, where she co-led the design and development of Uber’s first model lifecycle management system.

      "# [DoD Deploys Commercial AI Infrastructure For Underwater Threat Detection](https://www.diu.mil/latest/dod-successfully-deploys-commercial-ai-infrastructure-to-support-underwater)\nThe U.S. Navy and the Defense Innovation Unit announce an integrated capability for improved underwater target threat detection developed in just one year.\n\nJune 17, 2024 -- The U.S. Navy relies on machine learning (ML) models to support underwater target threat detection by unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV), but, until recently, has lacked a way to monitor and quickly improve post-deployment performance to maintain the models’ operational utility at scale. Prior to this project, systems would rely on ML models that can be slow to adapt to changing conditions or enemy tactics. AI infrastructure is required to continuously monitor and improve model performance to ensure the systems remain effective. Without this monitoring and retraining capability, ML models within these mission critical systems risk producing inaccurate or unreliable results. DIU has previously worked with the Navy to prototype and field the UUVs that run these algorithms.\n\nIn 2022, the Navy partnered with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to resolve this issue by leveraging commercial technology that could be integrated into the Navy’s existing systems. Using DIU’s Commercial Solutions Opening process, the team identified commercial machine learning operations (MLOps) vendors who could collectively provide a pipeline to track, modify, and redeploy ML algorithms for underwater target threat detection.\n\nAfter a competitive and thorough evaluation process, DIU awarded five prototype agreements in the fall of 2022 to Arize AI, Domino Data Lab, Fiddler AI, Latent AI, and Weights & Biases as part of Project Automatic Target Recognition using Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) for Maritime Operations (AMMO). Under Project AMMO, each vendor contributes an essential component of the overall capability. Together, these capabilities allow the Navy’s ML developers – Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, Northrop Grumman, and SeeByte – to focus on the core tasks of model creation and refinement, allowing the tools to handle the critical aspects of deployment, monitoring, and governance.\n\n“The partnership between the U.S. Navy and DIU has opened the pathways to commercial innovation and has produced a MLOps toolset that ensures our solutions adapt and evolve at the speed of tactical relevance, placing an enduring capability in the hands of the warfighter,” said Commander Eli Ford, Principal Assistant Program Manager, Underwater Explosive Ordnance Disposal, PMS 408 (Expeditionary Missions). “Nowhere was this more apparent than at an Integrated Battle Problem in the Fall of 2023 where sensor data was collected, new models were trained against an expanded threat environment, and updated detection models were deployed through the AMMO ecosystem back into the hands of the operator.”\n\nThe Fall 2023 exercise also revealed that the vendors’ new pipeline decreased the time needed for ML model updates from six months to a few days - a 97% decrease.\n\nAs of April 2024, each vendor successfully prototyped and deployed their portion of the broader AMMO MLOps pipeline. The Navy is in the process of awarding success memos to each vendor and transitioning this capability into production contracts, and will be expanding the technology to other naval missions. In addition, other partners across the Department are assessing how to best use the AMMO toolset to build and improve their own MLOps pipelines for other relevant use cases.\n\n“The partnership consisting of the Navy's Project Overmatch, PMS-408 Expeditionary Missions, Test Resource Management Center, and Defense Innovation Unit resulted in a capability known as Project AMMO. AMMO greatly contributed to accomplishing our subsea/seabed warfare (SSW) mission during a trilateral Integrated Battle Problem last fall by improving our ability to detect targets of interest in a complex and dynamic undersea environment,” said Commodore Shaun Lieb, Commander, Task Force (CTF) 75.\n\n“Working with multiple international partners, we demonstrated the ability to deploy and update our automatic target recognition models at the speed of operational relevance while simultaneously remaining confident in their performance. This embodiment of human-machine teaming gives our Sailors a powerful tool in their arsenal and increases confidence in their systems. I'm proud our warfare community could be the pathfinder and exemplar for machine learning ops, tooling, and processes that will improve many other Navy and joint service warfighting capabilities in the age of artificial intelligence,” continued Lieb.\n\nProject AMMO sets the stage for DoD to deploy and manage ML algorithms effectively at scale. Since robust MLOps practices are crucial for ensuring the safe, reliable, and effective operation of all ML models, AMMO’s capabilities provide a foundation for building the DoD’s trust in and reliance on these new technologies, furthering the DoD’s efforts to responsibly develop and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) and ML algorithms.",
