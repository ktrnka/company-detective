PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE TERMS OF USE INCLUDE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION WHICH REQUIRES THAT ANY PAST, PENDING, OR FUTURE DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US SHALL BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL AND NOT A CLASS-WIDE OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION ON A RETROACTIVE BASIS, YOU MAY OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISION WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS BY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED AT THE END OF THE SECTION TITLED \"BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS WAIVER.\"\n\nAcceptance of Terms\n\nThese terms and conditions of use (\"Terms of Use\") constitute a legal agreement that governs your relationship with DoubleDown Interactive LLC and its affiliated companies (collectively referred to as \"DoubleDown\" or \"We\" or “us”) regarding your use of DoubleDown's social games and related services, which include applications for mobile devices and DoubleDown-branded Web sites (the “Services\"). These Terms of Use apply to any Services provided by or Site operated by DoubleDown, including, without limitation, the DoubleDown casino located at www.doubledowncasino.com or any other sites on which these Terms of Use are posted, and/or where any DoubleDown application, Services, or product is licensed, downloaded or otherwise accessed through third party sites or sources (in each case, the “Site”).\n\nBy registering with, using or otherwise accessing the Services, including browsing the Site, accessing the Services with a mobile device or installing software obtained from the Site, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, accepted and agreed to be bound by these Terms of Use and any other terms and conditions referenced and incorporated herein, including, without limitation, the Privacy Policy referenced herein (\"Privacy Policy\").

You are responsible for reviewing these Terms of Use and Privacy Policy for modifications prior to accessing, using or downloading the Services. By your continued use of the Services, you acknowledge and agree that you shall be bound by any such modifications.

The Privacy Policy governs any personal information you provide to us. By using the Services or accessing the Site you agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy.\n\nBinding Arbitration and Class Waiver\n\nPLEASE READ THESE \"BINDING ARBITRATION\" AND \"CLASS WAIVER\" PROVISIONS CAREFULLY, BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE ALL DISPUTES WITH DOUBLEDOWN AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. WHILE YOU MUST AGREE TO THESE PROVISIONS AS TO ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, THERE IS AN OPTION, DESCRIBED BELOW, TO OPT OUT THE ARBITRATION AND CLASS WAIVER PROVISIONS. THE OPTION TO OPT-OUT IS TIME-LIMITED TO THIRTY (30) DAYS AND REQUIRES YOUR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.\n\nTHESE PROVISIONS GENERALLY PRECLUDE YOU FROM BRINGING ANY CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION AGAINST DOUBLEDOWN. THEY ALSO PRECLUDE YOU FROM PARTICIPATING IN OR RECOVERING RELIEF UNDER ANY PAST, PENDING, OR FUTURE CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION AGAINST DOUBLEDOWN BY SOMEONE ELSE. ARBITRATION PRECLUDES YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.\n\nScope of Arbitration Provision. You and DoubleDown agree that any past, pending, or future dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to your access to or use of any DoubleDown Site (including Services) or to these Terms of Use (including without limitation any dispute concerning the breach, enforcement, construction, validity, interpretation, enforceability, or arbitrability of these Terms of Use) (a \"Dispute\"), shall be determined by arbitration, except that you and DoubleDown are NOT required to arbitrate any Dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.\n\nWaiver of Class Relief. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you agree that you and DoubleDown will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding. You and DoubleDown are each waiving respective rights to participate in a class action. By accepting this agreement, you give up your right to participate in any past, pending or future class action or any other consolidated or representative proceeding, including any existing as of the date you agreed to these terms of use.\n\nWhether to agree to arbitration is an important decision. It is your decision to make and you are not required to rely solely on the information provided in these terms of use. You should take reasonable steps to conduct further research and to consult with counsel (at your expense) regarding the consequences of your decision.\n\nOPTION TO OPT OUT. YOU MAY OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION PROVISIONS BY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT OPT-OUT, THESE TERMS WILL APPLY RETROACTIVELY TO ALL CLAIMS YOU MAY POSSESS, WHETHER ASSERTED TO DATE OR NOT.\n\nPROCEDURE TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO AGREE TO THIS ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER AGREEMENT, YOU MUST, WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF ENTERING THIS AGREEMENT, SEND AN E-MAIL TO ARBITRATIONOPTOUT@DOUBLEDOWN.COM CONTAINING YOUR FULL NAME, ADDRESS, AND THE WORDS “OPT OUT” IN THE BODY OR SUBJECT LINE OF THE EMAIL.\n\nLocation of Arbitration and Applicable Rules. You and DoubleDown agree that such arbitration shall occur in Seattle, Washington. You may request to appear in such proceedings telephonically. You and DoubleDown agree that such arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms of Use.\n\nAuthority of Arbitrator. With the exception of class procedures and remedies as discussed above under \"Waiver of Class Relief,\" the arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.\n\nConfidentiality. You and DoubleDown shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceedings and the arbitration award, including the arbitration hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.\n\nAllocation of Arbitration Fees. If you assert a Dispute as an individual, you will only be required to pay arbitration fees of $250 in connection with any arbitration under this section, and DoubleDown will bear all other costs charged by AAA or the arbitrator up to $5,000. You will still be responsible for paying your own attorneys’ fees.\n\nYou and DoubleDown agree that any claims or lawsuits, regardless of form, arising out of or related to the Site (including Services) or these Terms of Use or Privacy Policy must BE FILED within ONE (1) YEAR of the action, omission, event or occurrence giving rise to the claim or suit, after which such claims will be time-barred and prohibited, without regard to any longer period of time which may be provided by any period of limitation or repose by law or statute. Each party shall bear its own costs in the arbitration proceeding. If any portion of this section entitled \"Binding Arbitration and Class Waiver\" is determined by a court to be inapplicable or invalid, then the remainder shall still be given full force and effect.\n\nRight to Use and Limitations on Use\n\nSubject to your agreement and continued compliance with the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, DoubleDown grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable limited right to access and use the Services through a supported Web browser or mobile device solely for your own non-commercial, entertainment purposes.\n\nYou represent and warrant that you have full right and authority to use the Services and to be bound by these Terms of Use.

If you purchase a subscription, then by clicking the purchase button you are requesting that DoubleDown begin supplying the subscription services immediately and are entering into a monthly subscription contract with us. You are also authorizing a charge to you of a monthly subscription fee at the rate quoted at the time of purchase. For subscription services purchased using Services or Sites played on a platform such as Facebook, Apple or Google, the platform will charge you for the subscription fee and the platform’s payment terms will apply. Please review the appropriate platform’s payment terms for additional information.\n\nSubscription rates are based on an amount in U.S. Dollars. The charges will be applied to the payment instrument you provide when you start your subscription (or to a different payment instrument, if you change your account information). Please note that prices and charges are subject to change, and in such instance, we will let you know in advance.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew each month unless and until you terminate your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews each month, otherwise payment of the next month's subscription fees will be taken automatically via your chosen payment method.\n\nYou may cancel at any time directly through the platform for games played on a platform. For each platform, please review their customer support websites or contact their customer support numbers for information regarding canceling auto-renewing subscriptions.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS, EXCEPT FOR EU CUSTOMERS THAT CANCEL WITHIN 14 DAYS OF THEIR INITIAL PURCHASE, AS EXPLAINED BELOW.\n\nIf you reside in the European Union, subscription services may be cancelled within 14 days from the date of your purchase and you may obtain a refund of your initial payment minus a reasonable pro-rated portion to cover your use of the subscription service prior to cancellation. Please refer to the relevant platform’s payment terms relevant to subscriptions for more information on exercising this cancellation right.\n\nDoubleDown may occasionally offer a one-time or limited-time bonus to players that have a current subscription or who agree to start a subscription. You understand that these items will not be a part of your ongoing subscription.\n\nVirtual Currency\n\nThe Services may include a virtual, in-game currency (\"Virtual Currency\") including, but not limited to chips, coins, cash, credits, tokens, metals, or points, that may be purchased through the Services for \"real world\" money if you are legally permitted to purchase such Virtual Currency in your country, province, jurisdiction and/or state of residence. The Services may also include virtual, in-game digital items (\"Virtual Goods\") that may be purchased through the Services for \"real world\" money (if you are legally permitted to purchase such Virtual Goods in your country, province, jurisdiction and/or state of residence) or for Virtual Currency. Regardless of the terminology used, Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods may never be redeemed for \"real world\" money, goods or other items of monetary value from DoubleDown or any other party. Prices and availability of Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods are subject to change without notice. Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods may only be purchased or acquired from us and through means we provide on the applicable website or otherwise expressly authorize. We reserve the right to refuse your request to purchase and/or acquire Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods for any reason. Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods may only be held by legal residents of jurisdictions where access to and use of the Services are permitted. Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods may only be purchased or acquired through means specifically authorized by DoubleDown. When you purchase Virtual Currency, it will reside in your DoubleDown account until discharged through use of the Services or otherwise surrendered as a result of termination of the Services in accordance with these Terms of Use. In certain circumstances and to facilitate offline play, your Virtual Currency may be stored on your mobile device, and in such instance such Virtual Currency cannot be used from any other source. Further, in certain circumstances Virtual Currency stored on a mobile device may not be transferred to another device, and unless otherwise prohibited by law, DoubleDown shall have no obligation to you if such Virtual Currency is not transferred.\n\nOther than a limited, personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable license to use the Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency with the Services, you have no right or title in or to any such Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency appearing or originating with the Services, or any other attributes associated with use of the Services or stored within the Services. DoubleDown has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate such Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods as it sees fit in its sole discretion to the extent legally permissible, and DoubleDown shall have no liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights. In addition to the foregoing, DoubleDown may selectively remove or revoke Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods associated with your account.\n\nThe transfer of Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to do so is in violation of these Terms of Use and may result in a lifetime ban from the Services and possible legal action.\n\nYou understand and agree that all sales of Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods are final and that DoubleDown is not required to provide a refund for any reason. All Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods are forfeited if your account is terminated or suspended for any reason, in DoubleDown's sole and absolute discretion, or if the Services are no longer available. To the extent legally permissible, if your account, or a particular subscription for the Service associated with your account, is terminated, suspended and/or if any Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods are selectively removed or revoked from your account, no refund will be granted, no Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods will be credited to you or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement.\n\nIntellectual Property Ownership\n\nDoubleDown and its licensors retain all rights in the content within the Services (including, but not limited to, applications, software, designs, graphics, texts, information, pictures, video, sound, music, and other files, and their selection and arrangement) (collectively, the \"Content\").

      "# [Welcome to DoubleDown Interactive](https://www.doubledowninteractive.com/responsible-play/index.html)\nResponsible gameplay\n\nWhat is Responsible Gameplay?\n\nThere are a wide variety of reasons why people enjoy playing video games, including to have fun, pass the time, and encourage relaxation. Regardless of your reason for playing, we want to ensure we're providing you with a safe, enjoyable experience. That includes a place to play responsibly, set limits or take a break. Playing video games can be a fun part of a balanced life, but DoubleDown Interactive recognizes that there can be too much of a good thing.\n\nWhile we offer social casino-style games, these games are not gambling, and do not offer the opportunity to win real money or prizes. Practice or success at social casino-style games does not imply future success at gambling. You must be 18 or older to access and play our social casino-style games.\n\nWhen Might Gameplay Be a Problem?\n\nIf you, a friend or a family member has concerns about your relationship with video games, please take a moment to ask yourself the below questions. While this list of questions is not meant to be comprehensive, or serve as a medical or psychological diagnostic test, answering yes to one or more of the following questions may help you identify the need to set limits, take a break from video games, and/or seek help from a trusted professional.\n\nIs your gameplay interfering with your work?\n\nIs your gameplay negatively impacting your home life?\n\nHave you lost interest in hobbies and activities you previously enjoyed, preferring to play video games instead?\n\nDo you find it difficult to limit the amount of time you spend playing video games?\n\nHave you ever felt sad or remorseful after playing a video game?\n\nDoes playing video games decrease your ambition or efficiency?\n\nDo you ever spend more money on video games than you can afford?\n\nDo you lie about or hide how much time or money you spend playing video games?\n\nDo your real life problems and challenges create an urge to play video games?\n\nHave you ever considered harming yourself as a result of your gameplay?\n\nWhat you can do\n\nSteps You Can Take If You Need a Break\n\nIt's important to keep your health and happiness in mind.

A rev to the game that I unlike is preset bid selections which has to be manually adjusted down (it cannot be bypassed) or it launches to high bid side.  I assume the creators made it this way to increase bid usage.   I like that DD can be played completely free.

Most of the time it takes up to 75 spins before you get a bonus, not matter what you bet.\nAlso, the “bingo” cards are simply a joke. They use the same numbers multiple times in every game. So the 1-75 on regular bingo is NOT how they play. The more bingo numbers you earn, the more times they start the 1-75, no matter how many times you open the game, the numbers start over.\nAs for the “trading cards”, same thing. How can you start a card collect, open 10 packs of 3 cards each and out of the 30 cards only 4 are new…give me a break.\nTotally over this app…\nNo matter how much you spend, you will never get ahead",

I work with attorneys and I know they are sticklers for being very cautious what you tell people because it can come back to bite you if it turns out to be wrong. The good news is that this process has moved quickly compared to other settlements. I read about the Big Fish Settlement and they requested a 60 day extension of time to get payments out because of all the challenges. \n\nI agree that it seems like the attorneys got a lot of money, but they did all the work and without them we wouldn't be getting ANYTHING, so I really don't have a problem with it.

I’m a gambler, both at real casinos and these just for fun apps. Until last week, I had 45 casino apps on my computer, and just logging in daily and collecting chips and spins from friends took 45 minutes to an hour everyday. Then a few times during the day to collect some more chips. I was spending hours playing these games, but having fun doing it. What brought me, and all of you, to the situation we’re in, is that DD does NOT let you win. You all gamble and like to play to win, but you can’t win with DD, so you lose all your chips, then have to buy more to keep the fun going. And it never ends! It goes on for years, hence the reason we’ve spent the outrageous amounts we have. I’ve been playing DD since the beginning (13, 14 years??) and I’m only on level 21, and I spent over $28K!! Yikes!! By comparison, I’ve been playing Slotomania for the same 13, 14 years, but I’m on level 27,663. Big difference. Out of all 45 games I play, DD is the ONLY one I’ve ever purchased chips for. The ONLY ONE! And again, that’s because DD does NOT pay. They turn the winnings on and off but insist it’s all random. It is not. A few years ago, I started the week with maybe 200K chips; 6 days later, I had over 9 billion, my highest amount since I started playing. Every game I was getting bonus after bonus after bonus. Then on day 7, poof, it stopped. Lost it all. I believe, actually I’m CONVINCED, the person in charge of flipping the on/off switch was on vacation and left it in the on position. There’s no other explanation, and again, I’ve been playing since the beginning. The problem is DD has all the IGT games I play in the real casino: Bombay, Stinkin Rich, Treasures of Troy, White Orchids, Wolf Run, etc. But as I said, lightbulb moment! Never again will I spend real money to buy fake chips. Never! And I hope you all learned your lesson as well. There’s tons of games out there that REALLY are free. Just stick with them. Thank you for letting me get this off my chest. I feel better already!! 🥰\n\n### Comment ID jzbw4xn with +2 score by [(Reasonable_Medium_18, Reddit, 2023-09-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/jzbw4xn/) (in reply to ID jywaxgj):\nWhat socks for me, is I can't remember the email I originally used to sign up, so I got told my lifetime spending amount is only 2.99, and I know I spent a LOT more.

I will admit that I have not read all the posted documents on the claims site and came across JND’s Declaration of Administration dated 2 May. It states, “As of May 2, 2023 JND has received a total of 130,765 timely claims, 129,229 online and 1,536 by mail or email. In JND’s preliminary review, it is estimated that the total Lifetime Spending Amount (LSA) of the claims received to date is approximately $594,423,645.63.” They also stated that of the 129,229 claims, they believe about 40,000 were spam. (Did the LSA they approximated at around $594 Million include the spam??? Who knows)  \nBut taking into consideration that the lawyer fees were about $121 Million and the settlement was for $415 Million, that leaves about $294 Million for the eligible claims that they sent notices to with their LSA. Rounding up the total LSA for all claims received by 2 May to $600 Million and with $294 Million to disperse to all eligible claims, the percentage would be around 49% payback “Just looking at the Total LSA of all claims vs the amount of money to disperse”. (294/600=49)  \nThey have stated payments of 60% for any amounts over $100,000, 30% for $10,000.01 - $100,000, 17.5% for amounts between $1000.01 - $10,000 and 1% between ,01 - $1,000.  \nSo, the payment estimator that is posted on their website might just be correct. I assume that there are numerous claims with a LSA under $10,000 as well as numerous claims over $100,000 with the rest in the middle ( 10,000.01 - $100,000)  \n**Now it is time to watch College Football and not think about DDC! 2 years sober!!**\n\n### Comment ID k1vwpp3 with +3 score by [(LazSlate, Reddit, 2023-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k1vwpp3/) (in reply to ID k1uv7ne):\nWeird how they allocate the money. Should be more evenly spread and everyone should get the same % back. Its almost like you penalized for spending less. If your LTS is $99,990 you would get 30% but if you spent $11 more it would be 60%.\n\n#### Comment ID k1x0urv with +7 score by [(KangarooIll7000, Reddit, 2023-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k1x0urv/) (in reply to ID k1vwpp3):\nThe reason for this, as I have read In the documents, is that anyone with the high spending, have had their lives impacted negatively to much greater degree than someone who was playing every so often. They have been distanced from their family and racked up debt and guilt. Lower spenders would carry a much lesser burden.\n\n#### Comment ID k1w38hi with +2 score by [(PartyKiwiGirl, Reddit, 2023-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k1w38hi/) (in reply to ID k1vwpp3):\nNot quite.  Amounts over 100,000 will get the 60%.  So that .99¢ (the amount over $100,000) will get 60%.  Not the whole total amount of the LTS.\n\nSo really—the person who spent 99,990 should get almost the same as the person who spent 100,001.00. The person who spent 100,001.00 would get approximately a dollar or so more.

You take a break from the game only to return with a limit to spend on coins but it goes all out the window when you lose all of your coins and want more. It’s like a cycle.

There will likely be a second distribution of a much lesser amount due to members that can not be found and forfeit their funds.That will be split accordingly with the other members. Some of this info is available on DoubleDownSettlelement.com under important documents. This is not carved in stone but is from the research I have done. I hope you get your 60%\n\n## Comment ID jwr6opb with +5 score by [(savamaca, Reddit, 2023-08-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/jwr6opb/) (in reply to ID 1540x0o):\nAs you can see in the estimator the higher you go on the scale the higher the %’s of return.  It was stated that the more you spent the more you will get back.  I would use the formula with your own personal spending amount and see what you get.  Based on the example of the formula, that amount is lower than what the estimator scale has for the low end of the range.  In the estimator if you slide to $40,000 you get a range of $12,434 - $31,086 but with the formula using $40,000 spent it estimates $8,273.  Remember with the formula the calculated amount is then discounted.  Take another look at the Plan of Allocation document under Important Documents.\n\n### Comment ID jws8njq with +1 score by [(KangarooIll7000, Reddit, 2023-08-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/jws8njq/) (in reply to ID jwr6opb):\ni agree the slider scale does not closely match the formula. It also mentions the second payment if also being $8273. But reading it all, I am confused by that. Since they know the associated claims are at least 590,000.000. and change, there is in my mind no other payments to be made since the claims are much higher than settlement. Can you explain that one to me? My Lts is way less than yours, but over 200,000.\n\n#### Comment ID jwsz6wg with +4 score by [(CryptographerNew7491, Reddit, 2023-08-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/jwsz6wg/) (in reply to ID jws8njq):\nIn one of the documents they said they estimate that the higher spenders may get as much as 60% back. A rep at Edelson told me a while back that they expect higher spenders will get at least 50%. I mean people who spend over $100,000.00. I would be very happy with 50%.

According to a lawyer who has past experience with class action settlements says this is a big payout for 90,000 people. $300 million will be dispursed after attorney fees and administrative fees are deducted from the $415 million. Someone with a lifetime spending amount of $200,000 will probably see a refund of at least $118,000.\n\nGood luck!

Then there are percentages of your total lifetime spending added on to that. The more you spend, the higher the percentage. One of the recent legal documents says 50-60% or more for those who spent the most, near the $100K mark. Those over $100K are not on the payment calculator but I bet it will be very high. If mine is correct, I should get $35-72K. This is just crazy! Who would ever have thought you'd get money back playing a stupid addictive game that you knew you were not winning at.

I have used it for over 10 years now and it is not always correct. Sometimes you will get a piece of mail that was not part of the email they send you showing what you are supposed to get that day. Sometimes Informed Delivery will say you are supposed to get a piece of mail and it does not get delivered for a few days. So check your mailbox every day no matter what USPS Informed delivery said.\n\nAnother note with regards to checks being mailed. Normal times are 1-5 business days for 1st class mail. Per JND's policy for checks not received, they will wait 30 days before they determine that the check was not delivered and cashed before the reissue of another check.

I knew I was spending a lot, but when I went back and added it all up I was just sick. So much money that I could have used for much better things. Plus, I stupidly went into debt using credit cards to play. I found myself buying \"just one more\" package so many times. The games are very addictive. When I looked back over my purchases I could easily tell that when I was spending the most were times when I was going through major life difficulties and grief from loss of loved ones. While I know the choices to play and spend money were my own, I believe DD was preying on people like me who were looking for escape from reality. They let you win a little, then you start making higher bets and trying to play the side games and challenges, and when you get close to completing a challenge, you start losing so you buy more chips thinking you'll win that extra little jackpot. The odds in Vegas are much better than DD, yet I found myself playing more and more, even knowing I wasn't going to win. This addiction is as bad as drugs or alcohol - it's hard to stop once you start playing. I loved playing the games, and I wouldn't even mind paying a small fee to play, such as a small monthly fee for unlimited coins or something, but it's not worth it after realizing just how much I spent. As a higher spender I'm hoping to get at least half my money back, and I will use that to pay off my debts and then I intend to \"pay it forward\" by helping out a couple of family members who are going through some hard times (they weren't playing this stupid game!). The rest will go into a savings account toward my retirement fund!\n\nI hope everyone gets a very nice payout and I'm praying for anyone who is or has been struggling with this or any other addiction!\n\n#### Comment ID k1hm0md with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k1hm0md/) (in reply to ID k1h29hs):\nEverything you said here is accurate. Over the 12 or 13 years I've played DD, I was shocked to see my lifetime spending. To me, it was only a few hundred a month. I don't spend money on anything for myself so I justified it. I also used to go to a real casino many of those years and was wasting money there too. I finally banned myself from the real casino because I knew I was becoming addicted. DDC is just as addictive. I played it at night, in the only quiet time I get. Played more when I was stressed out over family issues too. Anyway, I think we all know gambling is addictive and if you have an addictive personality, you can get in real trouble. I have not even told my husband about this settlement. He knows I played a game online, a lot, cause he could see the debits on my account. Now, if we get a big payout,  he's not even gonna believe this is real. I'm having a hard time believing it myself. But it will be nice if we get a big check and learn our lesson from it. Since I saw my lifetime spending total, I have only bought chips on DD twice. But after seeing this thread and how many people are just like me, embarassed about this, I am going to go home and block my account so I am unable to make in-app purchases. You can do it by creating a pin. Just make something up that you won't remember and you will never be able to make in-app purchases again.\n\n#### Comment ID k1ibv4d with +6 score by [(korisanzz, Reddit, 2023-09-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k1ibv4d/) (in reply to ID k1h29hs):\nHow the hell did we spend so much on absolutely nothing??

There are so many that are not valid. Reddit does not have moderators that will filter out the bad posts on this site so read with caution.\n\nPosts about money not available at Citibank, or that Citibank will not release funds until the 19th, checks getting bounced back for non payment by Citibank are all SPAM!\n\nJND has stated that there are no problems with Citibank releasing money or paying the claims. If you have a valid check from Citibank it will not bounce. The only hiccups are some of the direct deposits with the wrong banking information. These are typically typo's by either the claimant or JND.\n\nThe other concern is the bank hold. Even if you have funds in your account that are greater than the check you are trying to cash or deposit, most banks will put a hold on that check until it is cleared.  The time frame for hold depends on the bank, each has their own rules for checks like the ones we got (Settlement Check).  This is a quote from the Banking System (U.S.)\n\n\"Every year, money hungry thieves issue millions of counterfeit checks worth billions of dollars. Annually, about half a million Americans become the victim of scams involving fake or counterfeit checks, and the Better Business Bureau (BBB) reports that victims lose an average of $1,200 each.\"\n\n## Comment ID k8z6fwg with +4 score by [(x-Not_Spartacus-x, Reddit, 2023-11-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k8z6fwg/) (in reply to ID 1540x0o):\n$36K squandered. $16K retrieved.

Please note this is copied and pasted.  And from Charles Peng.   You go by what Edelson tells you unless they change (anticipated vs. certainty at this point). The green box should have been updated by now to confirm the payment date if it is 100% confirmed but it has not been done so and seems to be delay. Something likely is causing a holdup that has not been disclosed. If there is new information it would either be publicly released or at least someone will get a release from Edelson whether email or call. The multiplier is both closely guarded as well as give leeway in case of last minute changes like calculation error. The hint you got from Edelson/administrator is that multiplier will be higher than 1.16 (fall within range of calculator estimate and everyone will at minimum get their base payment) is that is only guarantee at this point. You can get multiplier from first payout. What you get divided by your calculated base payment based on plan of allocation = multiplier for everyone (up to 100% refund. Exception is people who hit 100% refund). It is only 1 more week of waiting though I feel like people are getting more anxious.\n\n### Comment ID k2d2s5x with +2 score by [(kekeforever22, Reddit, 2023-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k2d2s5x/) (in reply to ID k2coyzk):\nThank you for posting this!\nWell I think Charles once again has good information here.

Now thanks to some attorneys and some brave souls (who literally put their business in the streets)  we should all be grateful for whatever it is. You want answers like what time and where is it blah blah. I get it but if they gave you those answers and it was one minute past the time they said it would be more calls emails etc. There have been screenshots posted etc all with the same answers and to recap: Edelson- Oct 3 or first week of October depending upon which screen-shotted email(or phone recap), JND-At least 120 days or in production.

The lady read the last four digits of my account number to me BEFORE I told her the rest of the info.  My wife was on speaker phone with me looking at the account info, and they verified it was correct.  Then the week of October 3rd, when everyone was getting their deposits, I didn't get anything.  Waited til Thursday and called them and they said it was sent on October 3rd, and they verified the account info again.  They said I'd have to email requesting a re-issue, but with no further information.  I emailed and asked what went wrong and requested the reissue and gave them the bank information again. No reply....Waited til Monday and finally called the law office directly and had to leave a voicemail.  Thankfully the nice lady at the law office called back 30 minutes later and said she would look into it.  An hour later the administrators email me back with this Bullsh\\_\\_!!!    \n\n\n\"Your ACH direct deposit was issued on October 3, but was unsuccessful. Your payment information has been updated accordingly, as the information below is not the information provided on your claim form. Reissues are sent every 2 to 3 weeks.\"    \n\n\nWhat the hell would I have provided \"initially\"??  I only have one bank account that I use, and when I submitted my initial claim, I literally copied and pasted the routing number and account number from my bank account online portal, and then checked again to make sure it was accurate so exactly THIS did not happen.  Like, now I'm worried that they are gonna fat thumb it again and I have to wait another \"2 to 3 weeks\" for them to F\\_\\_ it up again.  I left a voicemail with the law office again to ask them to help make sure they get it right the next time.  And what's up with 2 to 3 weeks?  Just re-send it, a-holes, do you have a strict schedule for re-issuing payments or something?    \n\n\nSorry for the rant, but they assured me two weeks ago that they were depositing this money and I stupidly planned to have the money last week (yes, I know, don't ever count the money til' it's in the bank, but man, they said it would be deposited, so I believed them).\n\n#### Comment ID k4kd48f with +2 score by [(joeblawrence, Reddit, 2023-10-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k4kd48f/) (in reply to ID k4ifetk):\nso did you finally get your $$$$$????? waiting for mine\n\n#### Comment ID k4rx1v1 with +2 score by [(jen_kins, Reddit, 2023-10-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k4rx1v1/) (in reply to ID k4ifetk):\nI’m in the same boat, “ACH was unsuccessful” after 2 confirmations.

I COPIED and PASTED my routing number and account number from my bank and they blamed me, saying that the information I asked to be confirmed did not match what I originally put on my claim.  What really happened is they mis-typed it when they submitted the ACH, not just for me, but for a lot of people.  2 weeks later and I have no payment.  So Here's an update from the TCA Facebook site:  Someone called the judge's office:  \n\n\n*So I called the judges office and got his clerk. She was very nice but explained the judge can't do anything since he doesn't decide who the administrator is. She did give me the emails for 3 lawyers that were a part of this case...I just emailed them.

So im looking for someone to tell me if I should be looking for a big amount or small amount on my bank statement\n\n### Comment ID l5xsp2h with +1 score by [(HollynJohnnyMama, Reddit, 2024-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/l5xsp2h/) (in reply to ID l5mwxst):\nSecond payment was about 2.5% of the first payment.\n\n## Comment ID lqxg4yb with +1 score by [(GasAltruistic482, Reddit, 2024-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/lqxg4yb/) (in reply to ID 1540x0o):\nI am looking for possible suggestions and figured I will come to this community because  most on this thread may have had an issue with the same thing at one point or another… I have been requesting to be self excluded from Take5 free slots, which is run by doubleU . I have put it in writing multiple times and they are ignoring my request. Does anybody have any suggestions or lawyers to contact? I just simply want to self exclude from the app like double down allowed and it says right on their terms that that is something they do but yet they will not respond to my request. I’m assuming it’s because I have spent lots of money on their game… I am working on my mental health and I would like to self exclude and again they’re just blatantly ignoring my request.\n\n## Comment ID jzamm41 with +1 score by [(Comfortable-Door3361, Reddit, 2023-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/jzamm41/) (in reply to ID 1540x0o):\nLet’s remember its a 415 million settlement.

If only 0.5% of the 90,000 claims had a lifetime spending amount of $101,000 (60% base amount) then 4,500 people will get $272,700,000 based on the plan of allocation. (Higher amounts spent receive more). The legal fees are around $121,000,000. Which means that \"IF\" there were 4,500 people that spent over the $100,000 LSA the amounts will have to be calculated to give a lot less than that stupid calculator they have in the important documents section. My guess is that those that spent over $100,000 will get around 30% back and those that had a LSA between $10,001 and $100,000 will get 17.5% back and the rest will get 1% back.\n\nOf course this is all based on how many spent over $100,000. From reading through several forums it seems like a lot have. Or so they say they have. Someone on this site has claimed spending over $1 Million. A 60% base payout for him/her would take $600,000 out of the funds to be distributed.\n\n### Comment ID k0s3d4d with +2 score by [(StandardAd9831, Reddit, 2023-09-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k0s3d4d/) (in reply to ID k0mme6h):\nI don't think you did the plan of allocation right\n\n\n\n### Comment ID k0n80l0 with +1 score by [(kleen2thrdh, Reddit, 2023-09-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k0n80l0/) (in reply to ID k0mme6h):\nSo because my LSA isn’t quite 10k ($9991), I’m only getting back 1%? $99?

While I'm hoping the payments are not taxable, my main concern is to know exactly how to handle it. We are supposed to report it even if it's not taxable.

Yes, I was a very high spender and my refund was quite significant.  I pray that we all have learned from this experience because I do believe that this was a “once in a lifetime gift” and we should never take it for granted. All those nights I sat up playing and saying to myself “nobody else can be doing this because it’s insanity”.  But reading so many of the posts actually made me feel better in a terrible way.  What we did to ourselves was horrible and this settlement is a miracle.  I can only speak for myself and say that I will NEVER be in debt again.  Before DD I NEVER carried a penny of debt so at this age to suddenly owe so much was overwhelming.  I have paid everything already and am debt free once again.  There are no words to describe this weight being lifted off my shoulders.  I hope and pray the same for each and every one of you as well. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🥰🥰\n\n#### Comment ID k3lm7eq with +3 score by [(CryptographerNew7491, Reddit, 2023-10-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k3lm7eq/) (in reply to ID k3kcm49):\nI'm with you svamaca!

      "# Post ID xkpwho: Double Down Interactive Lawsuit Settlement Catalyst Update with +3 score by [(ChiefValue, Reddit, 2022-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContrarianStocks/comments/xkpwho/double_down_interactive_lawsuit_settlement/)\n DDI generates meaningful FCF with a sticky customer base and has been an effective app developer, maintaining a leading app by gross income for a decade. A short term headwind in the form of a class action lawsuit coupled with the current market conditions has made DDI trade at a significant discount to intrinsic value.  \n\n\nDouble Down Interactive Co, Ltd. is an online casino app developer that offers in app purchases for chips and pays out in chips. However, unlike normal casinos, DDI does not payout any actual money. The chips that players buy are entirely worthless and are a virtual currency restricted to the app. DDI operates a variety of casino slot games though a consolidated app portfolio to keep engagement tight and to streamline new games through a small number of apps. The strategy is to maintain one main app while updating the casino games on the app every 10-12 days. This allows the app to show up on the charts as popular and to make users more likely to keep using the single app. This is opposed to the more cyclical model of most video game and app developers that requires more marketing spend and risk. DDI is developing other games in the action and puzzle genres but <95% of revenues come from the social casino apps. DDI is a South Korean company that is traded on the NASDAQ as an ADR that represents 5% of a common share. (All per share numbers account for this.) DDI had it's IPO in September of 2021 and has since fallen 38% to $10/sh.  \n\n\nEven though the company's headquarters is in South Korea, 87% of revenue comes from the U.S. and a large portion of the development team are English speakers from the U.S. working out of the Seattle, Washington office.  \n\n\nDDI is a quality business with a 32% EBITDA margin and low CapEx requirements. CapEx as a % of cash from operations is in the sub 0.5% range. Gross margins remain stable around 65% as the largest cost in COGS is the 30% standard fee charged on in-app purchases from the app stores.  \n\n\nThe average revenue per daily active user is $0.97 compared to the $0.67 from the social casino peer group. This is mainly due to the high payer conversion rate of 5.2%. These numbers are made more impressive by the sticky customer base of which 92% of revenue is generated from 2010-2020 cohorts as of Q2 2022. This amounts to a loyal player base that also demonstrates a willingness to continue to pay, providing consistent cash flows for the business. A player acquisition payback period of under 200 days since 2017 shows a sustainable path to drive growth in an uncostly and low risk fashion.  \n\n\nCovid-19 increased revenues by 30% in 2020 from $273M to $358M. DDI is on track to generate approximately $332M of revenue in 2022. The payer conversion rate has dropped from 5.8% in 2Q21 back down to the normalized 5.2% rate in 2Q22 and the quarterly revenue declines have flattened, signaling that the sticky player base and quality engagement model has captured organic growth over the last two years.  \n\n\nThe largest risk factor was the class action lawsuit that was filed In 2018 for misleading players and not properly displaying the user agreement. This required DDI to build a cash reserve and refrain from any major value producing activities. Illiquidity and Covid-19 beneficiary status have also added to DDI being overlooked. However, the lawsuit was settled on Aug 29th and the mean reversion of earnings seems to have completed leaving little reason for the large discount. The details of the lawsuit are as follows,  \n\n\nDDI operates Free To Play (FTP) games that have in app transactions. Players start with free chips and then upon losing them have to reload their chip count with real money. It was argued that DDI intentionally hid the user agreement in an obscure part of the app in order to coerce players into paying for chips even though it was as advertised as FTP.  \n\n\n\"Subject to final court approval of the settlement of the Benson v. DoubleDown Interactive LLC, et. al. lawsuit, IGT and DoubleDown have also resolved all indemnification and other claims between themselves and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates relating to the Benson Matters. As a result of the settlement agreement, DoubleDown will accrue a $70.25 million expense in the third quarter of 2022 related to the incremental loss associated with the Benson Matters and related claims between IGT and DoubleDown and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. To date, DoubleDown has already accrued a total of $75 million in expenses related to the Benson Matters.\" - DDI  \n\n\nThis issue has since been addressed and measures have been taken to prevent this from happening again.  \n\n\nThe 145m that DDI has to pay for the settlement amounts to \\~18 months of FCF. Far better than the valuation would assume. Adjusting for the settlement charges, the new Enterprise Value is 576m. Using a normalized 2019 EBITDA for a conservative demonstration, gives an EV/EBITDA = 5.75. DDI will also still have a net cash position post settlement keeping the margin of safety intact.  \n\n\nPlaytika (PLTK), the closest and largest peer to DDI in the social casino space, trades at an EV/EBITDA of 10.75 and a FCF yield of 11%. With recent consolidation in the gaming space, the fact that PLTK is about 9x the mkt cap of DDI and has about 4x the FCF, it is possible that they could be a potential bidder in the near future, especially now that the legal troubles facing DDI have been resolved. PLTK also has an EBITDA margin of 38% compared to DDI's 33%, this may be seen as an opportunity for margin expansion through synergistic cost savings.  \n\n\nWith a social casino market annual growth rate of 4-5%, DDI is looking to expand into other gaming genres while utilizing the already in place development pipeline. This allows for relatively low cost opportunities to expand and diversify outside of the space into the remaining $143bn mobile games market.  \n\n\nWith the resolution of the lawsuit, it will allow DDI to use their significant FCF yield of \\~20% to seek expansive acquisitions, develop new games in different genres or possibly buyback shares. Over 90% of DDI is owned by insiders and as such creates a shareholder oriented management.  \n\n\nThe lawsuit settlement was an event that was a catalyst for value realization but little to no coverage, illiquidity and current market woes have led to this wildly positive event being overlooked. It is probable that this will be appreciated in the near future especially as earnings return back to normal after being adjusted downward for the settlement charges.\n\n## Comment ID kcoefwu with +1 score by [(Reasonable_Medium_18, Reddit, 2023-12-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContrarianStocks/comments/xkpwho/double_down_interactive_lawsuit_settlement/kcoefwu/) (in reply to ID xkpwho):\nI find it completely unfair that because I couldn't remember the email tied to all my purchases, I only got back the one that has been used minimally.

A rev to the game that I unlike is preset bid selections which has to be manually adjusted down (it cannot be bypassed) or it launches to high bid side.  I assume the creators made it this way to increase bid usage.   I like that DD can be played completely free.  I generally spend $20-$40 monthly or $9.99 per transaction to gain access to max bonus tiers.   Overall, I enjoy playing DoubleDown.",

I’m glad that I won a grand jackpot to get the 1.5 billion chips and didn’t pay for them because. I’m adding to this review because I can’t get anyone to help or respond to what happened to my chips. I will never ever buy chips again because they can just disappear!!! update: still no response to 3/4 of my chips disappearing overnight a few weeks ago. i will NEVER buy any more.

They use the same numbers multiple times in every game. So the 1-75 on regular bingo is NOT how they play. The more bingo numbers you earn, the more times they start the 1-75, no matter how many times you open the game, the numbers start over.\nAs for the “trading cards”, same thing. How can you start a card collect, open 10 packs of 3 cards each and out of the 30 cards only 4 are new…give me a break.\nTotally over this app…\nNo matter how much you spend, you will never get ahead",

Revenue exclusive of the contributions from SuprNation increased 3% to $75.2 million.\n\nOperating expenses increased to $47.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $43.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to the third quarter 2024 inclusion of operating expenses related to SuprNation, partially offset by lower sales and marketing and research and development expenses.\n\nNet income decreased to $25.1 million, or earnings per fully diluted common share of $10.11 ($0.51 per American Depositary Share (“ADS”)), in the third quarter of 2024, from net income of $26.9 million, or earnings per fully diluted common share of $10.87 ($0.54 per ADS), in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to loss on foreign currency translation and higher general and administrative expense which included new expenses for SuprNation, partially offset by higher revenue and lower overall sales and marketing and research and development expenses. Each ADS represents 0.05 share of a common share.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased to $36.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 from $29.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 43.5% in the third quarter of 2024 from 40.7% in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAverage Revenue Per Daily Active User (“ARPDAU”) for the Company’s social casino/free-to-play games increased to $1.30 in the third quarter of 2024 from $1.06 in the third quarter of 2023 and slightly decreased from $1.33 in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nAverage monthly revenue per payer for the social casino/free-to-play games increased to $281 in the third quarter of 2024 from $245 in the third quarter of 2023 and slightly decreased from $288 in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n“The third quarter marked another period of strong performance with consolidated revenue rising 14% to $83 million and Adjusted EBITDA increasing 22% to $36.1 million,” said In Keuk Kim, Chief Executive Officer of DoubleDown. “Our third quarter growth includes a 3% year-over-year increase in social casino revenue to $75.2 million, the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The consistent top-line and cash generating performance of our core social casino business highlights our best-in-class ability to monetize our loyal players while maintaining strict discipline with our user acquisition and R&D spend which drives strong profitability and free cash flow. This core operating focus, which we also apply to our SuprNation iGaming business, has resulted in trailing twelve months cash flows from operations of approximately $101 million, including $31.8 million generated in the 2024 third quarter, our third consecutive quarter of more than $30 million.\n\n“Our SuprNation iGaming operations continue to generate higher quarterly revenue compared to the estimated level the business was achieving prior to our acquisition in October 2023. As we gain more experience with operating our first real money casino site, our focus for the business continues to emphasize go-to-market initiatives, including marketing and player-engagement strategies, that are consistent with our commitment to drive profitable revenue growth and positive cash flow contributions.\n\n“Our disciplined approach to user acquisition and R&D spend delivers exceptional quarterly Adjusted EBITDA margins and free cash flow which continues to further solidify our strong balance sheet and financial position. We ended the third quarter with an aggregate net cash position of approximately $335 million, or approximately $6.76 per ADS. With our strong net cash position and consistent strong free cash flow generation we have significant financial flexibility to evaluate organic and M&A focused growth opportunities that can create new value for our shareholders.”\n\nSummary Operating Results for DoubleDown Interactive (Unaudited)\n\nThree months ended September 30,Nine months ended September 30,2024202320242023Revenue ($ MM)$83.0$73.0$259.4$225.8Total operating expenses47.743.3156.9143.2Net income ($ MM)$25.1$29.7$88.8$82.8Adjusted EBITDA ($ MM)$36.1$26.9$105.0$75.0Net income margin30.3%36.9%34.2%33.2%Adjusted EBITDA margin43.5%40.7%40.5%36.7%Non-financial performance metricsAverage MAUs (000s)1,3121,6751,3931,837Average DAUs (000s)632749665794ARPDAU$1.30$1.06$1.30$1.05Average monthly revenue per payer$281$245$283$234Payer conversion6.8%5.9%6.6%5.9%(1) Social casino/free-to-play games only\n\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nRevenue in the third quarter of 2024, inclusive of the contributions from SuprNation, was $83.0 million, an increase of 14% from $73.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Revenue exclusive of the contributions from SuprNation increased 3% year over year to $75.2 million, primarily reflecting higher engagement and monetization of the existing player base.\n\nOperating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 increased 10% year over year to $47.7 million. The increase is primarily due to the inclusion of SuprNation expenses in the third quarter of 2024, which were not incurred in the third quarter of 2023 given that SuprNation was acquired in October 2023.\n\nNet income was $25.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, or $10.11 per fully diluted common share ($0.51 per ADS), as compared to net income of $26.9 million, or $10.87 per fully diluted common share ($0.54 per ADS), in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily due to loss on foreign currency translation and higher general and administrative expenses which included the new expenses for SuprNation, partially offset by increased revenue and lower sales and marketing and research and development expenditures. Each ADS represents 0.05 share of a common share.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2024 increased 22%, or $6.4 million, to $36.1 million, compared to $29.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Consistent with the increase in net income, the improvement in Adjusted EBITDA primarily reflects higher revenue and lower sales and marketing and research and development expenses, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses which included the new expenses for SuprNation.\n\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $31.8 million from $28.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher operating income.\n\nConference Call\n\nDoubleDown will hold a conference call today (November 11, 2024) at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss these results. A question-and-answer session will follow management’s presentation.\n\nTo access the call, please use the following link: DoubleDown Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.

We are the creators of multi-format interactive entertainment experiences for casual players, bringing authentic Vegas entertainment to players around the world through an online social casino experience. The Company’s flagship social casino title, DoubleDown Casino, has been a fan-favorite game on leading social and mobile platforms for years, entertaining millions of players worldwide with a lineup of classic and modern games. Following its acquisition of SuprNation in October 2023, the Company also operates three real-money iGaming sites in Western Europe.\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nCertain statements contained in this press release are “forward-looking statements” about future events and expectations for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions, and expectations of industry trends, our future financial and operating performance, and our growth plans, taking into account the information currently available to us. These statements are not statements of historical fact. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on such statements. Words such as “anticipates,” believes,” “continues,” “estimates,” “expects,” “goal,” “objectives,” “intends,” “may,” “opportunity,” “plans,” potential,” “near-term,” long-term,” “projections,” “assumptions,” “projects,” “guidance,” “forecasts,” “outlook,” “target,” “trends,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “will,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. We qualify any forward-looking statements entirely by these cautionary factors. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements for any reason or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.\n\nUse and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), we believe the following non-GAAP financial measure is useful in evaluating our operating performance. We present “adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization” (“Adjusted EBITDA”) because we believe it assists investors and analysts by facilitating comparison of period-to-period operational performance on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. The items excluded from the Adjusted EBITDA may have a material impact on our financial results. Certain of those items are non-recurring, while others are non-cash in nature. Accordingly, the Adjusted EBITDA is presented as supplemental disclosure and should not be considered in isolation of, as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements furnished in our report on Form 6-K filed with the SEC.\n\nIn our reconciliation from our reported GAAP “net income before provision for taxes” to our Adjusted EBITDA, we eliminate the impact of the following six line items: (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) interest income; (iii) interest expense; (iv) foreign currency transaction/remeasurement (gain) loss; (v) short-term investments (gain) loss; and (vi) other (income) expense, net.

      "# [‎DoubleDown™ Casino Vegas Slots by Double Down Interactive LLC on 2012-03-01](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/doubledown-casino-vegas-slots/id485126024)\nFirst I Loveeee this App and compared to lots of others it’s more realistic but I must say it’s like being in the actual casino when you WIN you must play responsibly because you can Quickly loose all your coins as fast as you win them. I also feel the daily prizes aren’t equivalent as it should to your loyalty, purchases, and overall play. The spins aren’t VERY low most days and rarely gives large amounts compared to the amount of coins I play daily. The app should evaluate each person on these things. The daily overall gifts should be better and based on your loyalty with the app. It is sad that it’s only a few coins for all the effort one does daily. I feel it’s all in the purchase of coins however it doesn’t even consider that. It should be a benefit both ways. The daily giveaways should be higher coin amounts from the previous day performance, level, purchase etc. overall this is my go to casino app of all but I’m frustrated with the app lack of fairness with gifts and jackpots period but for now I will continue to play and I will see if changes come to enhance this app and make it even more enjoyable. It takes a win win on both sides. The “PLAYERS “ views matter!! So Developers Pay attention to these REAL customers reviews with concerns that affect you\n\nI’ve played for a little over a year. It was good in the beginning but has gone downhill fast. I play daily (at least the challenges) ant it took me a year to get above $400 million. Of course nearly half of that was daily giveaways. The themes are fun but like I said the winning percentage is atrocious and makes the games not fun. For example, there are several slots where you will not win unless you hit a bonus round. ( I consider winning making over your original bet, not “winning” $500 on a $10,000 bet) I have played daily challenges where the goal is one bonus round. I’ll put it on auto play and lose $30 million in under an hour (on $50k/bets) and still not hit a bonus round. I’ve received daily notification for 30 free spins and won absolutely nothing. Why would you promote free spins on a game and the game pays exactly $0 on $300k in spins? Finally, all you really need to know about how little these games pay out is to look at their weekly “jackpot happy hour” that starts Thursday evenings. This is where jackpots are easier to get on select machines and it runs until 1500 jackpots are won. It keeps a counter of wins in the upper left of the game. It almost always last to Saturday afternoon and sometimes we’ll in to Sunday. Really? If it’s easier to win a jackpot on your most popular machines during happy hour what do you think the odds are on the rest? Junk.\n\nIt would help if the bonus showed up a little more often it would also help for those that play every day if you added more millions on the wheel and people actually got the millions more often I used to play this every day, but it becomes mundane when your points are eaten up so fastbecause you don’t pay out enough or quick enough just the thoughts of a player I would suggest it to many friends if some changes were made just saying\n\nI do not wish to go on another media site such as Twitter, thank you. I do, however have a few questions. How often have you ever seen five diamonds in a row? How often do the three bonuses ever show up? How often when you bet high do you ever win, how many times do you ever see where you automatically hit large amounts these are just a few of the things I would like to see changed to make the game more worthwhile playing. I got on it today and didn’t see any changes. Maybe you should give that some thought. Loosen it up a little bit to make it more fun and make more people wanna play. This has been my favorite game for over the past three years and now I’ve turned to other games. I only want one game on my screen this one please make it worth my while, thank you I’ll update my review when you do",
