PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE TERMS OF USE INCLUDE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION WHICH REQUIRES THAT ANY PAST, PENDING, OR FUTURE DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US SHALL BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL AND NOT A CLASS-WIDE OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION ON A RETROACTIVE BASIS, YOU MAY OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISION WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS BY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED AT THE END OF THE SECTION TITLED \"BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS WAIVER.\"\n\nAcceptance of Terms\n\nThese terms and conditions of use (\"Terms of Use\") constitute a legal agreement that governs your relationship with DoubleDown Interactive LLC and its affiliated companies (collectively referred to as \"DoubleDown\" or \"We\" or “us”) regarding your use of DoubleDown's social games and related services, which include applications for mobile devices and DoubleDown-branded Web sites (the “Services\").

The Privacy Policy governs any personal information you provide to us. By using the Services or accessing the Site you agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy.\n\nBinding Arbitration and Class Waiver\n\nPLEASE READ THESE \"BINDING ARBITRATION\" AND \"CLASS WAIVER\" PROVISIONS CAREFULLY, BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE ALL DISPUTES WITH DOUBLEDOWN AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. WHILE YOU MUST AGREE TO THESE PROVISIONS AS TO ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, THERE IS AN OPTION, DESCRIBED BELOW, TO OPT OUT THE ARBITRATION AND CLASS WAIVER PROVISIONS. THE OPTION TO OPT-OUT IS TIME-LIMITED TO THIRTY (30) DAYS AND REQUIRES YOUR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.\n\nTHESE PROVISIONS GENERALLY PRECLUDE YOU FROM BRINGING ANY CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION AGAINST DOUBLEDOWN. THEY ALSO PRECLUDE YOU FROM PARTICIPATING IN OR RECOVERING RELIEF UNDER ANY PAST, PENDING, OR FUTURE CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION AGAINST DOUBLEDOWN BY SOMEONE ELSE. ARBITRATION PRECLUDES YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.\n\nScope of Arbitration Provision. You and DoubleDown agree that any past, pending, or future dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to your access to or use of any DoubleDown Site (including Services) or to these Terms of Use (including without limitation any dispute concerning the breach, enforcement, construction, validity, interpretation, enforceability, or arbitrability of these Terms of Use) (a \"Dispute\"), shall be determined by arbitration, except that you and DoubleDown are NOT required to arbitrate any Dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.\n\nWaiver of Class Relief. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you agree that you and DoubleDown will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding. You and DoubleDown are each waiving respective rights to participate in a class action. By accepting this agreement, you give up your right to participate in any past, pending or future class action or any other consolidated or representative proceeding, including any existing as of the date you agreed to these terms of use.\n\nWhether to agree to arbitration is an important decision. It is your decision to make and you are not required to rely solely on the information provided in these terms of use. You should take reasonable steps to conduct further research and to consult with counsel (at your expense) regarding the consequences of your decision.\n\nOPTION TO OPT OUT. YOU MAY OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION PROVISIONS BY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT OPT-OUT, THESE TERMS WILL APPLY RETROACTIVELY TO ALL CLAIMS YOU MAY POSSESS, WHETHER ASSERTED TO DATE OR NOT.\n\nPROCEDURE TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO AGREE TO THIS ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER AGREEMENT, YOU MUST, WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF ENTERING THIS AGREEMENT, SEND AN E-MAIL TO ARBITRATIONOPTOUT@DOUBLEDOWN.COM CONTAINING YOUR FULL NAME, ADDRESS, AND THE WORDS “OPT OUT” IN THE BODY OR SUBJECT LINE OF THE EMAIL.\n\nLocation of Arbitration and Applicable Rules. You and DoubleDown agree that such arbitration shall occur in Seattle, Washington. You may request to appear in such proceedings telephonically. You and DoubleDown agree that such arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms of Use.\n\nAuthority of Arbitrator. With the exception of class procedures and remedies as discussed above under \"Waiver of Class Relief,\" the arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.\n\nConfidentiality. You and DoubleDown shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceedings and the arbitration award, including the arbitration hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.\n\nAllocation of Arbitration Fees. If you assert a Dispute as an individual, you will only be required to pay arbitration fees of $250 in connection with any arbitration under this section, and DoubleDown will bear all other costs charged by AAA or the arbitrator up to $5,000. You will still be responsible for paying your own attorneys’ fees.\n\nYou and DoubleDown agree that any claims or lawsuits, regardless of form, arising out of or related to the Site (including Services) or these Terms of Use or Privacy Policy must BE FILED within ONE (1) YEAR of the action, omission, event or occurrence giving rise to the claim or suit, after which such claims will be time-barred and prohibited, without regard to any longer period of time which may be provided by any period of limitation or repose by law or statute. Each party shall bear its own costs in the arbitration proceeding. If any portion of this section entitled \"Binding Arbitration and Class Waiver\" is determined by a court to be inapplicable or invalid, then the remainder shall still be given full force and effect.\n\nRight to Use and Limitations on Use\n\nSubject to your agreement and continued compliance with the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, DoubleDown grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable limited right to access and use the Services through a supported Web browser or mobile device solely for your own non-commercial, entertainment purposes.\n\nYou represent and warrant that you have full right and authority to use the Services and to be bound by these Terms of Use.

If you purchase a subscription, then by clicking the purchase button you are requesting that DoubleDown begin supplying the subscription services immediately and are entering into a monthly subscription contract with us. You are also authorizing a charge to you of a monthly subscription fee at the rate quoted at the time of purchase. For subscription services purchased using Services or Sites played on a platform such as Facebook, Apple or Google, the platform will charge you for the subscription fee and the platform’s payment terms will apply. Please review the appropriate platform’s payment terms for additional information.\n\nSubscription rates are based on an amount in U.S. Dollars. The charges will be applied to the payment instrument you provide when you start your subscription (or to a different payment instrument, if you change your account information). Please note that prices and charges are subject to change, and in such instance, we will let you know in advance.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew each month unless and until you terminate your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews each month, otherwise payment of the next month's subscription fees will be taken automatically via your chosen payment method.\n\nYou may cancel at any time directly through the platform for games played on a platform. For each platform, please review their customer support websites or contact their customer support numbers for information regarding canceling auto-renewing subscriptions.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS, EXCEPT FOR EU CUSTOMERS THAT CANCEL WITHIN 14 DAYS OF THEIR INITIAL PURCHASE, AS EXPLAINED BELOW.\n\nIf you reside in the European Union, subscription services may be cancelled within 14 days from the date of your purchase and you may obtain a refund of your initial payment minus a reasonable pro-rated portion to cover your use of the subscription service prior to cancellation.

The Services may also include virtual, in-game digital items (\"Virtual Goods\") that may be purchased through the Services for \"real world\" money (if you are legally permitted to purchase such Virtual Goods in your country, province, jurisdiction and/or state of residence) or for Virtual Currency. Regardless of the terminology used, Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods may never be redeemed for \"real world\" money, goods or other items of monetary value from DoubleDown or any other party. Prices and availability of Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods are subject to change without notice.

We reserve the right to refuse your request to purchase and/or acquire Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods for any reason. Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods may only be held by legal residents of jurisdictions where access to and use of the Services are permitted. Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods may only be purchased or acquired through means specifically authorized by DoubleDown. When you purchase Virtual Currency, it will reside in your DoubleDown account until discharged through use of the Services or otherwise surrendered as a result of termination of the Services in accordance with these Terms of Use. In certain circumstances and to facilitate offline play, your Virtual Currency may be stored on your mobile device, and in such instance such Virtual Currency cannot be used from any other source. Further, in certain circumstances Virtual Currency stored on a mobile device may not be transferred to another device, and unless otherwise prohibited by law, DoubleDown shall have no obligation to you if such Virtual Currency is not transferred.\n\nOther than a limited, personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable license to use the Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency with the Services, you have no right or title in or to any such Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency appearing or originating with the Services, or any other attributes associated with use of the Services or stored within the Services. DoubleDown has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate such Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods as it sees fit in its sole discretion to the extent legally permissible, and DoubleDown shall have no liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights. In addition to the foregoing, DoubleDown may selectively remove or revoke Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods associated with your account.\n\nThe transfer of Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to do so is in violation of these Terms of Use and may result in a lifetime ban from the Services and possible legal action.\n\nYou understand and agree that all sales of Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods are final and that DoubleDown is not required to provide a refund for any reason. All Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods are forfeited if your account is terminated or suspended for any reason, in DoubleDown's sole and absolute discretion, or if the Services are no longer available. To the extent legally permissible, if your account, or a particular subscription for the Service associated with your account, is terminated, suspended and/or if any Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods are selectively removed or revoked from your account, no refund will be granted, no Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods will be credited to you or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement.\n\nIntellectual Property Ownership\n\nDoubleDown and its licensors retain all rights in the content within the Services (including, but not limited to, applications, software, designs, graphics, texts, information, pictures, video, sound, music, and other files, and their selection and arrangement) (collectively, the \"Content\").

      "# [Welcome to DoubleDown Interactive](https://www.doubledowninteractive.com/responsible-play/index.html)\nResponsible gameplay\n\nWhat is Responsible Gameplay?\n\nThere are a wide variety of reasons why people enjoy playing video games, including to have fun, pass the time, and encourage relaxation. Regardless of your reason for playing, we want to ensure we're providing you with a safe, enjoyable experience. That includes a place to play responsibly, set limits or take a break. Playing video games can be a fun part of a balanced life, but DoubleDown Interactive recognizes that there can be too much of a good thing.\n\nWhile we offer social casino-style games, these games are not gambling, and do not offer the opportunity to win real money or prizes. Practice or success at social casino-style games does not imply future success at gambling. You must be 18 or older to access and play our social casino-style games.\n\nWhen Might Gameplay Be a Problem?\n\nIf you, a friend or a family member has concerns about your relationship with video games, please take a moment to ask yourself the below questions.

Hell we loose hundreds of thousands of credits & $$$$$$$$. THE MAKERS OF THESE GAMES ARE CONS & THIEVES!!",

The settlement received final approval on 6/1/23. According to the settlement website, settlement class members with valid claims should receive payment within 90 days after the settlement has been finally approved and/or after any appeals process is complete, which is at least 120 days after final approval - to my understanding, this would mean early October unless the administrators file for a continuation of the deadline.

I emailed Edelson right after I filed my claim in early April and someone responded within 24 hours. They gave a standard reply and asked if I would like for someone to call me. I said yes and received a phone call later that day. I have been in touch with the same rep since then and she always responds by the next business day. Like everyone else, I get the same standard response, but I understand that they really aren't allowed to tell us much. I work with attorneys and I know they are sticklers for being very cautious what you tell people because it can come back to bite you if it turns out to be wrong. The good news is that this process has moved quickly compared to other settlements. I read about the Big Fish Settlement and they requested a 60 day extension of time to get payments out because of all the challenges. \n\nI agree that it seems like the attorneys got a lot of money, but they did all the work and without them we wouldn't be getting ANYTHING, so I really don't have a problem with it. I'm just grateful to be getting something back!!!!\n\n#### Comment ID k29gabk with +3 score by [(StandardAd9831, Reddit, 2023-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k29gabk/) (in reply to ID k28e49s):\nAntosr66..... All attorneys are the same way that's how they make their money. Usually cap amount on class action suits are around 25%.  Have an injury attorney You're looking at 40% easy. You may have read the important documents on their website but if you want to do some heavy reading go to Pacer. Thousands and thousands and thousands of pages from both sides.

Can’t make this stuff up folks. \n\nWhat document? It didn’t say anything about postcards. Postcards were mailed out to all eligible class members. Emails were also sent out. They have to notify members using the proper channels (all class action suits do this).

I’m a gambler, both at real casinos and these just for fun apps. Until last week, I had 45 casino apps on my computer, and just logging in daily and collecting chips and spins from friends took 45 minutes to an hour everyday. Then a few times during the day to collect some more chips. I was spending hours playing these games, but having fun doing it. What brought me, and all of you, to the situation we’re in, is that DD does NOT let you win. You all gamble and like to play to win, but you can’t win with DD, so you lose all your chips, then have to buy more to keep the fun going. And it never ends! It goes on for years, hence the reason we’ve spent the outrageous amounts we have. I’ve been playing DD since the beginning (13, 14 years??) and I’m only on level 21, and I spent over $28K!! Yikes!! By comparison, I’ve been playing Slotomania for the same 13, 14 years, but I’m on level 27,663. Big difference. Out of all 45 games I play, DD is the ONLY one I’ve ever purchased chips for. The ONLY ONE! And again, that’s because DD does NOT pay. They turn the winnings on and off but insist it’s all random. It is not. A few years ago, I started the week with maybe 200K chips; 6 days later, I had over 9 billion, my highest amount since I started playing. Every game I was getting bonus after bonus after bonus. Then on day 7, poof, it stopped. Lost it all. I believe, actually I’m CONVINCED, the person in charge of flipping the on/off switch was on vacation and left it in the on position. There’s no other explanation, and again, I’ve been playing since the beginning. The problem is DD has all the IGT games I play in the real casino: Bombay, Stinkin Rich, Treasures of Troy, White Orchids, Wolf Run, etc. But as I said, lightbulb moment! Never again will I spend real money to buy fake chips. Never! And I hope you all learned your lesson as well. There’s tons of games out there that REALLY are free. Just stick with them. Thank you for letting me get this off my chest. I feel better already!! 🥰\n\n### Comment ID jzbw4xn with +2 score by [(Reasonable_Medium_18, Reddit, 2023-09-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/jzbw4xn/) (in reply to ID jywaxgj):\nWhat socks for me, is I can't remember the email I originally used to sign up, so I got told my lifetime spending amount is only 2.99, and I know I spent a LOT more.

I will admit that I have not read all the posted documents on the claims site and came across JND’s Declaration of Administration dated 2 May. It states, “As of May 2, 2023 JND has received a total of 130,765 timely claims, 129,229 online and 1,536 by mail or email. In JND’s preliminary review, it is estimated that the total Lifetime Spending Amount (LSA) of the claims received to date is approximately $594,423,645.63.” They also stated that of the 129,229 claims, they believe about 40,000 were spam. (Did the LSA they approximated at around $594 Million include the spam??? Who knows)  \nBut taking into consideration that the lawyer fees were about $121 Million and the settlement was for $415 Million, that leaves about $294 Million for the eligible claims that they sent notices to with their LSA. Rounding up the total LSA for all claims received by 2 May to $600 Million and with $294 Million to disperse to all eligible claims, the percentage would be around 49% payback “Just looking at the Total LSA of all claims vs the amount of money to disperse”. (294/600=49)  \nThey have stated payments of 60% for any amounts over $100,000, 30% for $10,000.01 - $100,000, 17.5% for amounts between $1000.01 - $10,000 and 1% between ,01 - $1,000.  \nSo, the payment estimator that is posted on their website might just be correct. I assume that there are numerous claims with a LSA under $10,000 as well as numerous claims over $100,000 with the rest in the middle ( 10,000.01 - $100,000)  \n**Now it is time to watch College Football and not think about DDC! 2 years sober!!**\n\n### Comment ID k1vwpp3 with +3 score by [(LazSlate, Reddit, 2023-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k1vwpp3/) (in reply to ID k1uv7ne):\nWeird how they allocate the money.

They have been distanced from their family and racked up debt and guilt. Lower spenders would carry a much lesser burden.\n\n#### Comment ID k1w38hi with +2 score by [(PartyKiwiGirl, Reddit, 2023-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k1w38hi/) (in reply to ID k1vwpp3):\nNot quite.  Amounts over 100,000 will get the 60%.  So that .99¢ (the amount over $100,000) will get 60%.  Not the whole total amount of the LTS.\n\nSo really—the person who spent 99,990 should get almost the same as the person who spent 100,001.00. The person who spent 100,001.00 would get approximately a dollar or so more.

This game is almost like hypnosis, it’s sucks you in and gets your money. It doesn’t hit you until you’re out of coins and have spent a lot of money, then you realize the magnitude of what you’ve done. You take a break from the game only to return with a limit to spend on coins but it goes all out the window when you lose all of your coins and want more. It’s like a cycle.

Best of luck to you.\n\n#### Comment ID jux86cw with +2 score by [(savamaca, Reddit, 2023-08-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/jux86cw/) (in reply to ID jux7qa5):\nThank you for your kind words.\n\n### Comment ID juysm2f with +3 score by [(CryptographerNew7491, Reddit, 2023-08-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/juysm2f/) (in reply to ID juwt088):\nI understand what you mean. My spending was well over $100,000 and I was so addicted that I was going into debt just to play. A rep at Edelson that I spoke with early on told me they expect anyone that spent over $100,000 will probably get at least half of that back. That is a lifesaver for me! I too, am worried about the taxes. Many are saying it's a refund and not taxable but I don't want to get sideways with the IRS and have to pay a penalty if I don't pay taxes that are due. I will probably try to contact someone at the IRS after I get my payment just to see what I can find out. I wish you luck and hope you get a big payout! I also hope we DON'T have to pay taxes on it!\n\n#### Comment ID jv126n0 with +7 score by [(kekeforever22, Reddit, 2023-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/jv126n0/) (in reply to ID juysm2f):\nOver 100k spent for me too. \n\n*PER MY ACCOUNTANT: THIS IS NOT TAXABLE AS PAYMENT IS CLASSIFIED UNDER THIS SETTLEMENT AS A REFUND OF MONIES PAID BY YOU!* \n\nYou do NOT need to claim this on your taxes!\nThey ARE NOT giving 1099 forms for this payment!\n\nMy accountant worked for the IRS for over 20 years.

There will likely be a second distribution of a much lesser amount due to members that can not be found and forfeit their funds.That will be split accordingly with the other members. Some of this info is available on DoubleDownSettlelement.com under important documents. This is not carved in stone but is from the research I have done.

It was stated that the more you spent the more you will get back.  I would use the formula with your own personal spending amount and see what you get.  Based on the example of the formula, that amount is lower than what the estimator scale has for the low end of the range.  In the estimator if you slide to $40,000 you get a range of $12,434 - $31,086 but with the formula using $40,000 spent it estimates $8,273.  Remember with the formula the calculated amount is then discounted.  Take another look at the Plan of Allocation document under Important Documents.\n\n### Comment ID jws8njq with +1 score by [(KangarooIll7000, Reddit, 2023-08-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/jws8njq/) (in reply to ID jwr6opb):\ni agree the slider scale does not closely match the formula. It also mentions the second payment if also being $8273. But reading it all, I am confused by that. Since they know the associated claims are at least 590,000.000. and change, there is in my mind no other payments to be made since the claims are much higher than settlement. Can you explain that one to me? My Lts is way less than yours, but over 200,000.\n\n#### Comment ID jwsz6wg with +5 score by [(CryptographerNew7491, Reddit, 2023-08-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/jwsz6wg/) (in reply to ID jws8njq):\nIn one of the documents they said they estimate that the higher spenders may get as much as 60% back.

According to a lawyer who has past experience with class action settlements says this is a big payout for 90,000 people. $300 million will be dispursed after attorney fees and administrative fees are deducted from the $415 million. Someone with a lifetime spending amount of $200,000 will probably see a refund of at least $118,000.\n\nGood luck!

Then there are percentages of your total lifetime spending added on to that. The more you spend, the higher the percentage. One of the recent legal documents says 50-60% or more for those who spent the most, near the $100K mark. Those over $100K are not on the payment calculator but I bet it will be very high. If mine is correct, I should get $35-72K. This is just crazy! Who would ever have thought you'd get money back playing a stupid addictive game that you knew you were not winning at.

I have used it for over 10 years now and it is not always correct. Sometimes you will get a piece of mail that was not part of the email they send you showing what you are supposed to get that day. Sometimes Informed Delivery will say you are supposed to get a piece of mail and it does not get delivered for a few days. So check your mailbox every day no matter what USPS Informed delivery said.\n\nAnother note with regards to checks being mailed. Normal times are 1-5 business days for 1st class mail. Per JND's policy for checks not received, they will wait 30 days before they determine that the check was not delivered and cashed before the reissue of another check.

I knew I was spending a lot, but when I went back and added it all up I was just sick. So much money that I could have used for much better things. Plus, I stupidly went into debt using credit cards to play. I found myself buying \"just one more\" package so many times. The games are very addictive. When I looked back over my purchases I could easily tell that when I was spending the most were times when I was going through major life difficulties and grief from loss of loved ones. While I know the choices to play and spend money were my own, I believe DD was preying on people like me who were looking for escape from reality. They let you win a little, then you start making higher bets and trying to play the side games and challenges, and when you get close to completing a challenge, you start losing so you buy more chips thinking you'll win that extra little jackpot. The odds in Vegas are much better than DD, yet I found myself playing more and more, even knowing I wasn't going to win. This addiction is as bad as drugs or alcohol - it's hard to stop once you start playing. I loved playing the games, and I wouldn't even mind paying a small fee to play, such as a small monthly fee for unlimited coins or something, but it's not worth it after realizing just how much I spent. As a higher spender I'm hoping to get at least half my money back, and I will use that to pay off my debts and then I intend to \"pay it forward\" by helping out a couple of family members who are going through some hard times (they weren't playing this stupid game!). The rest will go into a savings account toward my retirement fund!\n\nI hope everyone gets a very nice payout and I'm praying for anyone who is or has been struggling with this or any other addiction!\n\n#### Comment ID k1hm0md with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k1hm0md/) (in reply to ID k1h29hs):\nEverything you said here is accurate. Over the 12 or 13 years I've played DD, I was shocked to see my lifetime spending. To me, it was only a few hundred a month. I don't spend money on anything for myself so I justified it. I also used to go to a real casino many of those years and was wasting money there too. I finally banned myself from the real casino because I knew I was becoming addicted. DDC is just as addictive. I played it at night, in the only quiet time I get. Played more when I was stressed out over family issues too. Anyway, I think we all know gambling is addictive and if you have an addictive personality, you can get in real trouble. I have not even told my husband about this settlement. He knows I played a game online, a lot, cause he could see the debits on my account. Now, if we get a big payout,  he's not even gonna believe this is real. I'm having a hard time believing it myself. But it will be nice if we get a big check and learn our lesson from it. Since I saw my lifetime spending total, I have only bought chips on DD twice. But after seeing this thread and how many people are just like me, embarassed about this, I am going to go home and block my account so I am unable to make in-app purchases. You can do it by creating a pin. Just make something up that you won't remember and you will never be able to make in-app purchases again.\n\n#### Comment ID k1ibv4d with +5 score by [(korisanzz, Reddit, 2023-09-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k1ibv4d/) (in reply to ID k1h29hs):\nHow the hell did we spend so much on absolutely nothing??

There are so many that are not valid. Reddit does not have moderators that will filter out the bad posts on this site so read with caution.\n\nPosts about money not available at Citibank, or that Citibank will not release funds until the 19th, checks getting bounced back for non payment by Citibank are all SPAM!\n\nJND has stated that there are no problems with Citibank releasing money or paying the claims. If you have a valid check from Citibank it will not bounce. The only hiccups are some of the direct deposits with the wrong banking information. These are typically typo's by either the claimant or JND.\n\nThe other concern is the bank hold. Even if you have funds in your account that are greater than the check you are trying to cash or deposit, most banks will put a hold on that check until it is cleared.  The time frame for hold depends on the bank, each has their own rules for checks like the ones we got (Settlement Check).  This is a quote from the Banking System (U.S.)\n\n\"Every year, money hungry thieves issue millions of counterfeit checks worth billions of dollars. Annually, about half a million Americans become the victim of scams involving fake or counterfeit checks, and the Better Business Bureau (BBB) reports that victims lose an average of $1,200 each.\"\n\n## Comment ID k8z6fwg with +4 score by [(x-Not_Spartacus-x, Reddit, 2023-11-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k8z6fwg/) (in reply to ID 1540x0o):\n$36K squandered. $16K retrieved.

Please note this is copied and pasted.  And from Charles Peng.   You go by what Edelson tells you unless they change (anticipated vs. certainty at this point). The green box should have been updated by now to confirm the payment date if it is 100% confirmed but it has not been done so and seems to be delay. Something likely is causing a holdup that has not been disclosed. If there is new information it would either be publicly released or at least someone will get a release from Edelson whether email or call. The multiplier is both closely guarded as well as give leeway in case of last minute changes like calculation error. The hint you got from Edelson/administrator is that multiplier will be higher than 1.16 (fall within range of calculator estimate and everyone will at minimum get their base payment) is that is only guarantee at this point. You can get multiplier from first payout. What you get divided by your calculated base payment based on plan of allocation = multiplier for everyone (up to 100% refund. Exception is people who hit 100% refund). It is only 1 more week of waiting though I feel like people are getting more anxious.\n\n### Comment ID k2d2s5x with +2 score by [(kekeforever22, Reddit, 2023-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k2d2s5x/) (in reply to ID k2coyzk):\nThank you for posting this!\nWell I think Charles once again has good information here.

The lady read the last four digits of my account number to me BEFORE I told her the rest of the info.  My wife was on speaker phone with me looking at the account info, and they verified it was correct.  Then the week of October 3rd, when everyone was getting their deposits, I didn't get anything.  Waited til Thursday and called them and they said it was sent on October 3rd, and they verified the account info again.  They said I'd have to email requesting a re-issue, but with no further information.  I emailed and asked what went wrong and requested the reissue and gave them the bank information again. No reply....Waited til Monday and finally called the law office directly and had to leave a voicemail.  Thankfully the nice lady at the law office called back 30 minutes later and said she would look into it.  An hour later the administrators email me back with this Bullsh\\_\\_!!!    \n\n\n\"Your ACH direct deposit was issued on October 3, but was unsuccessful. Your payment information has been updated accordingly, as the information below is not the information provided on your claim form. Reissues are sent every 2 to 3 weeks.\"    \n\n\nWhat the hell would I have provided \"initially\"??  I only have one bank account that I use, and when I submitted my initial claim, I literally copied and pasted the routing number and account number from my bank account online portal, and then checked again to make sure it was accurate so exactly THIS did not happen.  Like, now I'm worried that they are gonna fat thumb it again and I have to wait another \"2 to 3 weeks\" for them to F\\_\\_ it up again.  I left a voicemail with the law office again to ask them to help make sure they get it right the next time.  And what's up with 2 to 3 weeks?  Just re-send it, a-holes, do you have a strict schedule for re-issuing payments or something?    \n\n\nSorry for the rant, but they assured me two weeks ago that they were depositing this money and I stupidly planned to have the money last week (yes, I know, don't ever count the money til' it's in the bank, but man, they said it would be deposited, so I believed them).\n\n#### Comment ID k4kd48f with +2 score by [(joeblawrence, Reddit, 2023-10-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k4kd48f/) (in reply to ID k4ifetk):\nso did you finally get your $$$$$????? waiting for mine\n\n#### Comment ID k4rx1v1 with +2 score by [(jen_kins, Reddit, 2023-10-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k4rx1v1/) (in reply to ID k4ifetk):\nI’m in the same boat, “ACH was unsuccessful” after 2 confirmations.

I COPIED and PASTED my routing number and account number from my bank and they blamed me, saying that the information I asked to be confirmed did not match what I originally put on my claim.  What really happened is they mis-typed it when they submitted the ACH, not just for me, but for a lot of people.  2 weeks later and I have no payment.  So Here's an update from the TCA Facebook site:  Someone called the judge's office:  \n\n\n*So I called the judges office and got his clerk. She was very nice but explained the judge can't do anything since he doesn't decide who the administrator is. She did give me the emails for 3 lawyers that were a part of this case...I just emailed them. And FYI, they have gotten a number of calls about this and she said it is unusual...which means JDN totally messed up.

I need to know one more time what to say to a tax attonery so I do not have to pay taxes on it.

If only 0.5% of the 90,000 claims had a lifetime spending amount of $101,000 (60% base amount) then 4,500 people will get $272,700,000 based on the plan of allocation. (Higher amounts spent receive more). The legal fees are around $121,000,000. Which means that \"IF\" there were 4,500 people that spent over the $100,000 LSA the amounts will have to be calculated to give a lot less than that stupid calculator they have in the important documents section. My guess is that those that spent over $100,000 will get around 30% back and those that had a LSA between $10,001 and $100,000 will get 17.5% back and the rest will get 1% back.\n\nOf course this is all based on how many spent over $100,000. From reading through several forums it seems like a lot have. Or so they say they have. Someone on this site has claimed spending over $1 Million. A 60% base payout for him/her would take $600,000 out of the funds to be distributed.\n\n### Comment ID k0s3d4d with +2 score by [(StandardAd9831, Reddit, 2023-09-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k0s3d4d/) (in reply to ID k0mme6h):\nI don't think you did the plan of allocation right\n\n\n\n### Comment ID k0n80l0 with +1 score by [(kleen2thrdh, Reddit, 2023-09-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k0n80l0/) (in reply to ID k0mme6h):\nSo because my LSA isn’t quite 10k ($9991), I’m only getting back 1%? $99?

Yes, I was a very high spender and my refund was quite significant.  I pray that we all have learned from this experience because I do believe that this was a “once in a lifetime gift” and we should never take it for granted. All those nights I sat up playing and saying to myself “nobody else can be doing this because it’s insanity”.  But reading so many of the posts actually made me feel better in a terrible way.  What we did to ourselves was horrible and this settlement is a miracle.  I can only speak for myself and say that I will NEVER be in debt again.  Before DD I NEVER carried a penny of debt so at this age to suddenly owe so much was overwhelming.  I have paid everything already and am debt free once again.  There are no words to describe this weight being lifted off my shoulders.  I hope and pray the same for each and every one of you as well. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🥰🥰\n\n#### Comment ID k3lm7eq with +3 score by [(CryptographerNew7491, Reddit, 2023-10-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k3lm7eq/) (in reply to ID k3kcm49):\nI'm with you svamaca!

As far as a second disbursement, it was explained in the Class Action Settlement Agreement.  I believe it said if checks weren’t cashed within 90 days from issuance, or electronic deposits couldn’t be processed within 90 days, then that money would be returned to the Settlement Fund for redistribution. I don’t think that would amount to anything of significance though.\n\n## Comment ID k750x1s with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-10-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k750x1s/) (in reply to ID 1540x0o):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID k7y3r4i with +1 score by [(WildRefrigerator6793, Reddit, 2023-11-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k7y3r4i/) (in reply to ID 1540x0o):\nI used to think that playing DDC was a waste of money! Not anymore. Took the grandkids to see a movie they wanted to see and the tickets, popcorn, drinks and a couple snacks were over $100 for a 1 hour 45 minute movie. We then went to play games at a video arcade. Lowest token card to play (you have to buy a card loaded up with points to play) was $42 + tax. Another $100+ but the games lasted less than one hour.\n\nSo don't feel bad about spending all that money on Double Down. It is entertainment and if played right lasts longer than the movies and arcade.\n\n## Comment ID k850gm9 with +1 score by [(Separate_Ad1782, Reddit, 2023-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k850gm9/) (in reply to ID 1540x0o):\nAnyone that was still waiting on a check get it recently??\n\n### Comment ID k8z7dew with +2 score by [(x-Not_Spartacus-x, Reddit, 2023-11-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k8z7dew/) (in reply to ID k850gm9):\nYes.

At the very least, pay your employees better for the amount of work they’re doing, higher the proper amount of staff needed, and stop playing favorites with the overseas studios and hold them accountable for their inability to deliver and collaborate as a team. The growing hostility and lack of respect toward your own employees is resulting in very low morale, not that you would even know.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "Pay is comparatively low for the industry and the city\n\nMobility is no guarantee, the promotion/merit process was a mess and changed multiple times the 3 years I was with Double Down. Company loves to brag about how much money it has in the bank but when its time to give people the proper compensation they deserve, or fully staff teams, suddenly we have to tighten the purse.\n\nThe employee self-review process is unclear and often unfair. Leadership frequently complains that employees give themselves too high of a score and will make up any excuse they can to knock your review down and keep you from moving up in pay grade. \n\nMultiple instances of people getting moved around teams, getting more responsibilities and title changes but with no adjustment to compensation.\n\n‘Soft benefits’ have been cutting back more and more\n\nThe leadership team is a disorganized mess and has no creative vision. They want to branch out into different games since the cash cow casino game is old and so is its player base. However, there is absolutely no proper planning, regular communication, or GTM strategy with the rest of the company. It's like they do everything on the fly at the very last minute, which results in sloppy work being done. When I left, the company was in a ‘throw everything at the wall and see what sticks’ phase, trying to develop several new apps at once yet every team is understaffed in part due to layoffs, but gives managers a hard time acquiring new employees. This had led to multiple failed apps and canceled projects in the last couple of years. \n\nThe Korean offices are a nightmare to work with, horrible with communication, and have absolutely *zero* desire for collaboration. They regularly fail to communicate on time, don’t deliver projects when needed, and then blame us when things don’t go well. Since the company is owned by a Korean firm, leadership has cultivated this culture in which we are effectively not allowed to/unable to communicate and work with them on a consistent basis or hold them accountable which means the US teams struggle to do their job properly but gets most of the blame. The overseas devs will randomly add crappy new features that no one wants into the flagship game and will regularly do so without telling any of us until a week before it goes out to all players and then are shocked when it fails. And yet when the US office wants to make simple, easy improvements to this ancient game so we can stop resting on our laurels and actually compete with modern games we get told they don’t have the time. Leadership plays favorites and always comes to the defense for their incompetence and unrealistic expectations. It’s like management is purposefully setting us up for failure. \n\nThe company’s CMO was so bad to work with that people would complain about working with them on a daily basis. There have been a few instances of people quitting or turning down promotions/title changes because they refuse to report to the CMO. Unrealistic expectations, unattainable goals, hostile attitude, favoritism, etc. \n\nConfusing and increasingly hostile WFH policy has led to very talented and longtime staff departing because managers are not allowed to WFH permanently - but the company keeps hiring fully remote employees. Make up your mind!\n\nEmployees are told to use a sick day or come into the office sick on our in-office day instead of just working remotely, and C-Suite forces managers to take attendance on whos coming in or not like we’re in daycare.",

If you HAVE figured it out, tell everyone about it at every opportunity. Then enforce it with peer reviews, manager reviews, and principle-based interviews.\r\n\r\n3: Let people know what their job is, what their goals are, what the company's goals are, then help them succeed. That is at least half of your job and it is the responsibility that nearly every manager at this company ignores.\r\n\r\n3: Stop being afraid. The worst thing they can do is fire you. Acting like the business is not in danger, and that everything is proceeding as expected alienates and demoralizes your people. Admit that things are hard, then talk about how you can fix them.\r\n\r\n4: Don't give up. You still have a solid business despite years of floundering and tough competition. This company is depressing because of all the squandered potential and the toxic culture, but that means you have a lot of simple ways to make things work. DO IT.",

No one really cared about delivering a stunning performance because it would either be ignored, or make others feel like they were being shown up.\r\n\r\n2: We have a lot of money, but most likely not for you. Unless you are in favor, or working for a team that has recently hollowed out, you will be told that promotions are hard and money is tight.\r\n\r\n3:A lot of people are simply not interested in doing a good job. Or any real work at all. These people are rewarded as long as they don't upset anyone. If you show up, deliver your lines -- maybe ad lib something funny but uncontroversial -- you will do well. If you try to do something great, or take risks to attain that greatness you will not do well, young Diva.\r\n\r\n4: It is really hard to eat the free breakfasts or enjoy free massages when the company is disintegrating because of the hubris, insecurities, and ignorance of our culture. When the soul of a narrative dies but the story plods on, what's left is sad and only gets worse the longer it continues. It's just a lot of forced jokes and laugh tracks.\r\n\r\n5: There are some amazing people working there, but they are now leaving as fast as they can find jobs. Most who are left are the kind of people who fail to get other jobs because of \"team fit\" issues. Occasionally someone who looks like a hot-shot on paper may show up to interview (or more often, be taken through a few perfunctory conversations masked as interviews before getting rubber-stamped by an exec), but if we don't actually assess their ability to elevate the team, we have failed the company and the customer.\r\n\r\n6: I have no idea how to be successful, as my job description is completely incompatible with my daily duties. What is my story? My motivation? How do I fit in to the promises we made about who we wanted to be? How does that fit in to the promises we made to our customers? \r\n\r\n7: Without a clear line between action and consequence, nothing has meaning. If I utterly fail to meet a commitment, and there is no consequence, why would I ever bother trying to succeed in the future? Why would anyone ever put in long hours to accomplish goals that are ethereal and shifting, if they are even articulated at all?\r\n\r\n8: We really don't do science, or learn from things, so you feel like you are going insane. Arguments that were settled years ago come back up and everyone acts like they're in undiscovered territory. Problems are not addressed in reasonable and measured ways, they are handled in a way that satisfies the narrative. It is a surreal descent in to madness, and there are often moments where a new employee will look around in disbelief at the unfolding irrationality and drama, possibly thinking they are victims of a long con.",

They may have a line or two, but they are just background; nice and often talented, but not consequential to the plot. \r\n\r\n2: We have a lot of money, so if execs think you are worth it, they will throw it at you. We have been renewed for several seasons beyond our ability to tell a meaningful story to our customers. As long as we are making money you must be doing something right.\r\n\r\n3: If you need to coast, or have a side gig, you will find an excellent work/other work/life balance. No one is really paying attention to your performance, so if you show up a little off, no one will notice.\r\n\r\n4: We are fiddling extra hard while the company burns, so there are still a lot of perks. We attend and sponsor events, and splash money around; even building out a new floor in the building, though we never occupied it. We look really cool while we throw good money after bad, and you'll get to feel special when you attend the events we sponsor in the area. \r\n\r\n5: There are some genuinely amazing people working there. You feel privileged working with actors who are too good for this gig.\r\n\r\n6: I am able to work on pretty much whatever I want. I can ad-lib an architecture, or make a completely unresearched argument for a piece of tech that is nonsensical but sounds cool. If it FEELS right for the show, that is much more important than it actually being a good fit. \r\n\r\n7: There is little to no accountability, so when you make mistakes, it isn't a big deal. No one is really watching you any more, and if they notice, they know you jumped the shark a long time ago. So hey -- you do you.\r\n\r\n8: We really don't do science, or learn from things. Like a bad sitcom, there is a LOT of drama because urgency is sexy. None of it actually matters, and nothing really changes all that often. We just like to promise the same things; thrills, passion, joy, danger, and boundary-pushing action. We haven't delivered, but we still make money. That's what matters.",

We want to feel that we have growth opportunities at a company that promotes from within. We want to believe in the morals and mission statement of this company - as much as working for a virtual online casino will allow. The problem with Doubledown's much-touted perks, is that they are a distraction from much larger problems which are becoming increasingly hard to ignore. Look, I get it: free massages are hard to pass up, and for a long time, I was starry eyed from all the amazing perks we have here. Now I'm wondering why it takes so darn long for things to improve. I feel discouraged and distracted by how many people have left in such a short time for greener pastures. If this company wants to return to its glory days, things have got to change. And that starts with the organizational culture, growth opportunities, and transparency. Thank you.",

I find myself wondering things like.... What do most of the Producers and Designers even DO? Our games don't require any innovation, and I don't see any plans to change that. What do half of the Artists spend their time doing? A quarter of the art team left this year! Evidently they're all partying it up on the 2nd floor and taking 3 hour lunches because ALL WE EVER RELEASE ARE IGT PORTS. I haven't seen anything impressive, innovative, or even remotely ambitious come out of our in-house studio after working here for a full year. I haven't seen any significant improvements to our build stability or test environments, because it's a constant uphill battle. (Props to the guys who care on our dev team though, lord knows their job requires them to be MacGyver, fixing completely BROKEN systems with an oxygen tank and some fishing wire. I think I would go insane.)\r\nI know this is a somewhat emotionally charged review, but everything I say is real and sincere. I'm terribly frustrated to have left my old job for THIS, I feel like DoubleDown promised me the world and lied all the way. They told me they're an amazing start-up where individuals could make a difference. Instead nothing gets shipped and nobody's accountable. The work is frustrating and poorly communicated, all these holes created by key people leaving at inopportune times. I haven't even been here for very long, and I'm already looking for a way out!",

Maybe fear tactics will work in his benefit, I think he has good intentions, but then again, I'm not there anymore.

There is a very strong distinction between regular employees and ethically questionable high up management. Upper management is very corporate and hard to approach in general.

Fully stocked kitchen, weekly massages, catered breakfast on Wed, game room, flexible schedule. \r\n\r\nCompany culture is much better now. There had been some negative employees who worked in the past but they all left. The new executive staff has done a great job making sure company culture is positive and fun, execute on delivery and pushing out the negative employees who hold the company back from producing.",

It does not give us a reason for existing 2 years from now, or a reason to feel good about coming to work every day.  Remember that \"Make a lot of money and have a lot of players and paying players\" are not a strategic vision.  We want that too! But those things aren't inherently motivating in their own right.  \r\n\r\nPut your people first -- Always.  Solving a short term problem isn't productive, no matter what the technology, if you're not building a team and a culture where people can be given opportunities to succeed, and to take controlled risks.  The well being of your subordinates and teams should be your top priority; success in every other area will follow naturally.",

Managers always seem to prefer to hire someone from outside the company instead of looking at the resources they already have on hand. Some managers seem to actively resist internal promotions in favor of external hires.  This is demoralizing to teams and individual contributors, and is actively destructive outside of team dynamics because of the tech debt that's always introduced by trying to solve our old problems of complexity by adding layers to them.\r\n\r\nOur review processes are arbitrary and seem to have no bearing on reality of employee performance or daily conversations with managers. Ratings are a surprise, feedback does not correlate well with the ratings, and ratings feel like they're set outside of the manager/subordinate relationship -- it's as if the ratings come from some quota set from above, and then the manager fills in the blanks on the review to match the magic number. \r\n\r\nOur senior Engineering and Product leadership seem more focused on their own short term agendas and political maneuvering than they are on trying to establish any common objectives for the company.  This trickles down to the rest of their organizations -- Product is disassociated with reality,  and much of our Engineering leadership seems more interested in resume building than in actually solving problems we face as a company.  \r\n\r\nWe lack any common vision or strategic goals. If they exist, they are not well communicated down the chain, and management doesn't work to keep teams focused on any common vision -- every manager has their own agenda, and will gladly play blame games and fight with each other if their agenda favors it. \r\n\r\nVery few leaders within the company care about team building or improving team dynamics; those who do are disincentiveized because there's always someone who's willing to cut corners or push problems on to other teams or individuals so that they can deliver something of any quality as quickly as possible  -- and all anyone cares about is the short term.  Leaders and individual contributors who show initiative to try and improve broken systems or tools are disincentiveized for the same reason -- trying to improve broken things or buck the status quo in any way whatsoever is bad for your career at DoubleDown, because the immediate deliverable of the next two weeks is all that matters to Managers.  \r\n\r\nIn Engineering we're Agile in Name Only -- as described above, Management will gleefully demand short term deliverables and minimum viable product ... but, since we lack any long term goal or unifying vision, ANY deliverable seems as valid as another, as long as you can do it quickly and push problems away from yourself.",

It does not give us a reason for existing 2 years from now, or a reason to feel good about coming to work every day.  Remember that \"Make a lot of money and have a lot of players and paying players\" are not a strategic vision.  We want that too! But those things aren't inherently motivating in their own right.  \r\n\r\nPut your people first -- Always.  Solving a short term problem isn't productive, no matter what the technology, if you're not building a team and a culture where people can be given opportunities to succeed, and to take controlled risks.  The well being of your subordinates and teams should be your top priority; success in every other area will follow naturally.",

Managers always seem to prefer to hire someone from outside the company instead of looking at the resources they already have on hand. Some managers seem to actively resist internal promotions in favor of external hires.  This is demoralizing to teams and individual contributors, and is actively destructive outside of team dynamics because of the tech debt that's always introduced by trying to solve our old problems of complexity by adding layers to them.\r\n\r\nOur review processes are arbitrary and seem to have no bearing on reality of employee performance or daily conversations with managers. Ratings are a surprise, feedback does not correlate well with the ratings, and ratings feel like they're set outside of the manager/subordinate relationship -- it's as if the ratings come from some quota set from above, and then the manager fills in the blanks on the review to match the magic number. \r\n\r\nOur senior Engineering and Product leadership seem more focused on their own short term agendas and political maneuvering than they are on trying to establish any common objectives for the company.  This trickles down to the rest of their organizations -- Product is disassociated with reality,  and much of our Engineering leadership seems more interested in resume building than in actually solving problems we face as a company.  \r\n\r\nWe lack any common vision or strategic goals. If they exist, they are not well communicated down the chain, and management doesn't work to keep teams focused on any common vision -- every manager has their own agenda, and will gladly play blame games and fight with each other if their agenda favors it. \r\n\r\nVery few leaders within the company care about team building or improving team dynamics; those who do are disincentiveized because there's always someone who's willing to cut corners or push problems on to other teams or individuals so that they can deliver something of any quality as quickly as possible  -- and all anyone cares about is the short term.  Leaders and individual contributors who show initiative to try and improve broken systems or tools are disincentiveized for the same reason -- trying to improve broken things or buck the status quo in any way whatsoever is bad for your career at DoubleDown, because the immediate deliverable of the next two weeks is all that matters to Managers.  \r\n\r\nIn Engineering we're Agile in Name Only -- as described above, Management will gleefully demand short term deliverables and minimum viable product ... but, since we lack any long term goal or unifying vision, ANY deliverable seems as valid as another, as long as you can do it quickly and push problems away from yourself.",

What do half of the Artists spend their time doing? A quarter of the art team left this year! Evidently they're all partying it up on the 2nd floor and taking 3 hour lunches because ALL WE EVER RELEASE ARE IGT PORTS. I haven't seen anything impressive, innovative, or even remotely ambitious come out of our in-house studio after working here for a full year. I haven't seen any significant improvements to our build stability or test environments, because it's a constant uphill battle.

I'm terribly frustrated to have left my old job for THIS, I feel like DoubleDown promised me the world and lied all the way.

We want to feel that we have growth opportunities at a company that promotes from within. We want to believe in the morals and mission statement of this company - as much as working for a virtual online casino will allow. The problem with Doubledown's much-touted perks, is that they are a distraction from much larger problems which are becoming increasingly hard to ignore.

That is at least half of your job and it is the responsibility that nearly every manager at this company ignores.\r\n\r\n3: Stop being afraid. The worst thing they can do is fire you. Acting like the business is not in danger, and that everything is proceeding as expected alienates and demoralizes your people. Admit that things are hard, then talk about how you can fix them.\r\n\r\n4: Don't give up. You still have a solid business despite years of floundering and tough competition.

Unless you are in favor, or working for a team that has recently hollowed out, you will be told that promotions are hard and money is tight.\r\n\r\n3:A lot of people are simply not interested in doing a good job. Or any real work at all. These people are rewarded as long as they don't upset anyone. If you show up, deliver your lines -- maybe ad lib something funny but uncontroversial -- you will do well. If you try to do something great, or take risks to attain that greatness you will not do well, young Diva.\r\n\r\n4: It is really hard to eat the free breakfasts or enjoy free massages when the company is disintegrating because of the hubris, insecurities, and ignorance of our culture. When the soul of a narrative dies but the story plods on, what's left is sad and only gets worse the longer it continues. It's just a lot of forced jokes and laugh tracks.\r\n\r\n5: There are some amazing people working there, but they are now leaving as fast as they can find jobs. Most who are left are the kind of people who fail to get other jobs because of \"team fit\" issues. Occasionally someone who looks like a hot-shot on paper may show up to interview (or more often, be taken through a few perfunctory conversations masked as interviews before getting rubber-stamped by an exec), but if we don't actually assess their ability to elevate the team, we have failed the company and the customer.\r\n\r\n6: I have no idea how to be successful, as my job description is completely incompatible with my daily duties. What is my story? My motivation? How do I fit in to the promises we made about who we wanted to be? How does that fit in to the promises we made to our customers? \r\n\r\n7: Without a clear line between action and consequence, nothing has meaning. If I utterly fail to meet a commitment, and there is no consequence, why would I ever bother trying to succeed in the future? Why would anyone ever put in long hours to accomplish goals that are ethereal and shifting, if they are even articulated at all?\r\n\r\n8: We really don't do science, or learn from things, so you feel like you are going insane. Arguments that were settled years ago come back up and everyone acts like they're in undiscovered territory.

We have been renewed for several seasons beyond our ability to tell a meaningful story to our customers. As long as we are making money you must be doing something right.\r\n\r\n3: If you need to coast, or have a side gig, you will find an excellent work/other work/life balance. No one is really paying attention to your performance, so if you show up a little off, no one will notice.\r\n\r\n4: We are fiddling extra hard while the company burns, so there are still a lot of perks. We attend and sponsor events, and splash money around; even building out a new floor in the building, though we never occupied it. We look really cool while we throw good money after bad, and you'll get to feel special when you attend the events we sponsor in the area. \r\n\r\n5: There are some genuinely amazing people working there.

No one is really watching you any more, and if they notice, they know you jumped the shark a long time ago. So hey -- you do you.\r\n\r\n8: We really don't do science, or learn from things. Like a bad sitcom, there is a LOT of drama because urgency is sexy. None of it actually matters, and nothing really changes all that often.

At the very least, pay your employees better for the amount of work they’re doing, higher the proper amount of staff needed, and stop playing favorites with the overseas studios and hold them accountable for their inability to deliver and collaborate as a team. The growing hostility and lack of respect toward your own employees is resulting in very low morale, not that you would even know.",
        "cons": "Pay is comparatively low for the industry and the city\n\nMobility is no guarantee, the promotion/merit process was a mess and changed multiple times the 3 years I was with Double Down. Company loves to brag about how much money it has in the bank but when its time to give people the proper compensation they deserve, or fully staff teams, suddenly we have to tighten the purse.\n\nThe employee self-review process is unclear and often unfair. Leadership frequently complains that employees give themselves too high of a score and will make up any excuse they can to knock your review down and keep you from moving up in pay grade. \n\nMultiple instances of people getting moved around teams, getting more responsibilities and title changes but with no adjustment to compensation.\n\n‘Soft benefits’ have been cutting back more and more\n\nThe leadership team is a disorganized mess and has no creative vision. They want to branch out into different games since the cash cow casino game is old and so is its player base. However, there is absolutely no proper planning, regular communication, or GTM strategy with the rest of the company. It's like they do everything on the fly at the very last minute, which results in sloppy work being done. When I left, the company was in a ‘throw everything at the wall and see what sticks’ phase, trying to develop several new apps at once yet every team is understaffed in part due to layoffs, but gives managers a hard time acquiring new employees. This had led to multiple failed apps and canceled projects in the last couple of years. \n\nThe Korean offices are a nightmare to work with, horrible with communication, and have absolutely *zero* desire for collaboration. They regularly fail to communicate on time, don’t deliver projects when needed, and then blame us when things don’t go well. Since the company is owned by a Korean firm, leadership has cultivated this culture in which we are effectively not allowed to/unable to communicate and work with them on a consistent basis or hold them accountable which means the US teams struggle to do their job properly but gets most of the blame. The overseas devs will randomly add crappy new features that no one wants into the flagship game and will regularly do so without telling any of us until a week before it goes out to all players and then are shocked when it fails. And yet when the US office wants to make simple, easy improvements to this ancient game so we can stop resting on our laurels and actually compete with modern games we get told they don’t have the time. Leadership plays favorites and always comes to the defense for their incompetence and unrealistic expectations. It’s like management is purposefully setting us up for failure. \n\nThe company’s CMO was so bad to work with that people would complain about working with them on a daily basis. There have been a few instances of people quitting or turning down promotions/title changes because they refuse to report to the CMO. Unrealistic expectations, unattainable goals, hostile attitude, favoritism, etc. \n\nConfusing and increasingly hostile WFH policy has led to very talented and longtime staff departing because managers are not allowed to WFH permanently - but the company keeps hiring fully remote employees. Make up your mind!\n\nEmployees are told to use a sick day or come into the office sick on our in-office day instead of just working remotely, and C-Suite forces managers to take attendance on whos coming in or not like we’re in daycare.",

      "# [DoubleDown Interactive Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results by DoubleDown Interactive Co., Ltd, DoubleDown Interactive Co on 2024-11-11](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/11/11/2978574/0/en/DoubleDown-Interactive-Reports-Third-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results.html)\nSEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DoubleDown Interactive Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ: DDI) (“DoubleDown” or the “Company”), a leading developer and publisher of digital games on mobile and web-based platforms, today announced unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThird Quarter 2024 vs. Third Quarter 2023 Summary:\n\nRevenue increased to $83.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $73.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. SuprNation, a European iGaming operator (“SuprNation”) which was acquired by the Company on October 31, 2023, generated total revenue of $7.8 million in the third quarter of 2024. Revenue exclusive of the contributions from SuprNation increased 3% to $75.2 million.\n\nOperating expenses increased to $47.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 from $43.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to the third quarter 2024 inclusion of operating expenses related to SuprNation, partially offset by lower sales and marketing and research and development expenses.\n\nNet income decreased to $25.1 million, or earnings per fully diluted common share of $10.11 ($0.51 per American Depositary Share (“ADS”)), in the third quarter of 2024, from net income of $26.9 million, or earnings per fully diluted common share of $10.87 ($0.54 per ADS), in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to loss on foreign currency translation and higher general and administrative expense which included new expenses for SuprNation, partially offset by higher revenue and lower overall sales and marketing and research and development expenses. Each ADS represents 0.05 share of a common share.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased to $36.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 from $29.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 43.5% in the third quarter of 2024 from 40.7% in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAverage Revenue Per Daily Active User (“ARPDAU”) for the Company’s social casino/free-to-play games increased to $1.30 in the third quarter of 2024 from $1.06 in the third quarter of 2023 and slightly decreased from $1.33 in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nAverage monthly revenue per payer for the social casino/free-to-play games increased to $281 in the third quarter of 2024 from $245 in the third quarter of 2023 and slightly decreased from $288 in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n“The third quarter marked another period of strong performance with consolidated revenue rising 14% to $83 million and Adjusted EBITDA increasing 22% to $36.1 million,” said In Keuk Kim, Chief Executive Officer of DoubleDown. “Our third quarter growth includes a 3% year-over-year increase in social casino revenue to $75.2 million, the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The consistent top-line and cash generating performance of our core social casino business highlights our best-in-class ability to monetize our loyal players while maintaining strict discipline with our user acquisition and R&D spend which drives strong profitability and free cash flow. This core operating focus, which we also apply to our SuprNation iGaming business, has resulted in trailing twelve months cash flows from operations of approximately $101 million, including $31.8 million generated in the 2024 third quarter, our third consecutive quarter of more than $30 million.\n\n“Our SuprNation iGaming operations continue to generate higher quarterly revenue compared to the estimated level the business was achieving prior to our acquisition in October 2023. As we gain more experience with operating our first real money casino site, our focus for the business continues to emphasize go-to-market initiatives, including marketing and player-engagement strategies, that are consistent with our commitment to drive profitable revenue growth and positive cash flow contributions.\n\n“Our disciplined approach to user acquisition and R&D spend delivers exceptional quarterly Adjusted EBITDA margins and free cash flow which continues to further solidify our strong balance sheet and financial position. We ended the third quarter with an aggregate net cash position of approximately $335 million, or approximately $6.76 per ADS. With our strong net cash position and consistent strong free cash flow generation we have significant financial flexibility to evaluate organic and M&A focused growth opportunities that can create new value for our shareholders.”\n\nSummary Operating Results for DoubleDown Interactive (Unaudited)\n\nThree months ended September 30,Nine months ended September 30,2024202320242023Revenue ($ MM)$83.0$73.0$259.4$225.8Total operating expenses47.743.3156.9143.2Net income ($ MM)$25.1$29.7$88.8$82.8Adjusted EBITDA ($ MM)$36.1$26.9$105.0$75.0Net income margin30.3%36.9%34.2%33.2%Adjusted EBITDA margin43.5%40.7%40.5%36.7%Non-financial performance metricsAverage MAUs (000s)1,3121,6751,3931,837Average DAUs (000s)632749665794ARPDAU$1.30$1.06$1.30$1.05Average monthly revenue per payer$281$245$283$234Payer conversion6.8%5.9%6.6%5.9%(1) Social casino/free-to-play games only\n\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nRevenue in the third quarter of 2024, inclusive of the contributions from SuprNation, was $83.0 million, an increase of 14% from $73.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Revenue exclusive of the contributions from SuprNation increased 3% year over year to $75.2 million, primarily reflecting higher engagement and monetization of the existing player base.\n\nOperating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 increased 10% year over year to $47.7 million. The increase is primarily due to the inclusion of SuprNation expenses in the third quarter of 2024, which were not incurred in the third quarter of 2023 given that SuprNation was acquired in October 2023.\n\nNet income was $25.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, or $10.11 per fully diluted common share ($0.51 per ADS), as compared to net income of $26.9 million, or $10.87 per fully diluted common share ($0.54 per ADS), in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily due to loss on foreign currency translation and higher general and administrative expenses which included the new expenses for SuprNation, partially offset by increased revenue and lower sales and marketing and research and development expenditures. Each ADS represents 0.05 share of a common share.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2024 increased 22%, or $6.4 million, to $36.1 million, compared to $29.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Consistent with the increase in net income, the improvement in Adjusted EBITDA primarily reflects higher revenue and lower sales and marketing and research and development expenses, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses which included the new expenses for SuprNation.\n\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $31.8 million from $28.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher operating income.\n\nConference Call\n\nDoubleDown will hold a conference call today (November 11, 2024) at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss these results. A question-and-answer session will follow management’s presentation.\n\nTo access the call, please use the following link: DoubleDown Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.

Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions, and expectations of industry trends, our future financial and operating performance, and our growth plans, taking into account the information currently available to us. These statements are not statements of historical fact. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on such statements. Words such as “anticipates,” believes,” “continues,” “estimates,” “expects,” “goal,” “objectives,” “intends,” “may,” “opportunity,” “plans,” potential,” “near-term,” long-term,” “projections,” “assumptions,” “projects,” “guidance,” “forecasts,” “outlook,” “target,” “trends,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “will,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. We qualify any forward-looking statements entirely by these cautionary factors. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements for any reason or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.\n\nUse and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), we believe the following non-GAAP financial measure is useful in evaluating our operating performance. We present “adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization” (“Adjusted EBITDA”) because we believe it assists investors and analysts by facilitating comparison of period-to-period operational performance on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. The items excluded from the Adjusted EBITDA may have a material impact on our financial results. Certain of those items are non-recurring, while others are non-cash in nature. Accordingly, the Adjusted EBITDA is presented as supplemental disclosure and should not be considered in isolation of, as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements furnished in our report on Form 6-K filed with the SEC.\n\nIn our reconciliation from our reported GAAP “net income before provision for taxes” to our Adjusted EBITDA, we eliminate the impact of the following six line items: (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) interest income; (iii) interest expense; (iv) foreign currency transaction/remeasurement (gain) loss; (v) short-term investments (gain) loss; and (vi) other (income) expense, net.

      "# [DoubleDown Interactive Reports Strong 2024 Earnings: Revenue Up 10%, Profit Surges 23% by Doubledown Interactive Co., Ltd, StockTitan on 2025-02-11](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/DDI/double-down-interactive-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-2wjtl9juz8jk.html)\nDoubleDown Interactive Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results\n\n02/11/2025 - 04:05 PM\n\nSEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DoubleDown Interactive Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ: DDI) (“DoubleDown” or the “Company”), a leading developer and publisher of digital games on mobile and web-based platforms, today announced unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company is reporting its financial results in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and has also adopted IFRS for the annual period beginning on January 1, 2024 in connection with the preparation of its 2024 full year financial statements. As such, the financial results for the 2024 fourth quarter and full year periods, as well as the comparable periods for 2023, reflect IFRS. The Company previously reported its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).\n\nFourth Quarter 2024 vs. Fourth Quarter 2023 Summary:\n\nRevenue was $82.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $83.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. SuprNation, a European iGaming operator (“SuprNation”) which was acquired by the Company in October 2023, generated revenue of $9.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Excluding contributions from SuprNation, revenue decreased 7% year over year to $73.0 million.\n\nOperating expenses were $47.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $47.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses which included an additional month of SuprNation operations compared to the prior-year period, partially offset by lower research and development expenses.\n\nProfit (excluding non-controlling interest) was $35.6 million, or earnings per fully diluted common share of $14.37 ($0.72 per American Depositary Share (“ADS”)), in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to profit (excluding non-controlling interest) of $25.9 million, or earnings per fully diluted common share of $10.47 ($0.52 per ADS), in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase primarily reflects gains in foreign exchange transaction and currency translation. Each ADS represents 0.05 share of a common share.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $35.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $37.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 42.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 44.5% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nAverage Revenue Per Daily Active User (“ARPDAU”) for the Company’s social casino/free-to-play games increased to $1.30 in the fourth quarter of 2024 from $1.24 in the fourth quarter of 2023 and was unchanged from the third quarter of 2024.\n\nAverage monthly revenue per payer for the social casino/free-to-play games increased to $282 in the fourth quarter of 2024 from $279 in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $281 in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n“DoubleDown’s fourth quarter results highlight the ability of our businesses to generate consistently strong profitability and free cash flow despite the slight revenue decline compared to the fourth quarter of 2023,” said In Keuk Kim, Chief Executive Officer of DoubleDown. “In the fourth quarter and throughout 2024 we delivered strong monetization metrics for our flagship social casino game, DoubleDown Casino, including full-year ARPDAU and average revenue per payer growth of 16% for both metrics when compared to the full year 2023 period. Our best-in-class ability to monetize our loyal players combined with our disciplined approach to user acquisition and R&D spend, drove cash flow from operations of $148 million in 2024, further solidifying our balance sheet.\n\n“Our SuprNation iGaming business gained momentum throughout 2024 culminating with fourth quarter revenue being the highest under our ownership. With a full year of experience operating this business, we are targeting additional top line growth in 2025 as we pursue market share growth in SuprNation’s core U.K. and Sweden markets, subject to favorable market conditions.\n\n“We continue to prioritize capital efficiency as reflected in our strong Adjusted EBITDA margins and free cash flow. At 2024 year-end, our aggregate net cash position was approximately $380 million, up $145 million from the end of 2023, and equivalent to approximately $7.69 per ADS. Our attractive net cash position and consistent free cash flow generation provides us with significant flexibility to deploy capital against organic and M&A focused growth opportunities that would further expand the business into new gaming categories with attractive addressable markets to create additional value for our shareholders.”\n\nFull Year 2024 vs. Full Year 2023 Summary\n\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $341.3 million, an increase of 10% from $308.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Revenue exclusive of the contributions from SuprNation increased 1% year over year to $308.3 million, primarily reflecting higher engagement and monetization of the existing player base.\n\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $204.3 million, an increase of 7% compared to $190.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily due to the inclusion of ten additional months of SuprNation expenses which were not incurred in the year ended December 31, 2023 given that SuprNation was acquired in October 2023.\n\nProfit (excluding non-controlling interest) was $124.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, or $50.06 per fully diluted common share ($2.50 per ADS), as compared to profit (excluding non-controlling interest) of $101.0 million, or $40.78 per fully diluted common share ($2.04 per ADS), for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher revenue and gains in foreign exchange transaction and translation, partially offset by higher operating expenses which included the new expenses for SuprNation. Each ADS represents 0.05 share of a common share.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased 16%, or $19.8 million, to $141.9 million, compared to $122.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Consistent with the increase in profit, the improvement in Adjusted EBITDA primarily reflects higher revenue and lower sales and marketing and research and development expenses, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses which included the new expenses for SuprNation.\n\nARPDAU for the Company’s social casino/free-to-play games increased to $1.30 for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $1.09 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nAverage monthly revenue per payer for the social casino/free-to-play games increased to $283 for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $245 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased to $148.5 million from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher profit in 2024, as well as the final payment of $95.3 million towards the Benson litigation settlement that occurred in 2023.\n\nSummary Operating Results for DoubleDown Interactive (Unaudited)\n\nThree months ended December 31,Year ended December 31,2024202320242023Revenue ($ MM)$82.0$83.1$341.3$308.9Total operating expenses ($ MM)(47.8)(47.4)(204.3)(190.3)Profit for the year ($ MM)$35.7$26.0$124.4$101.1Adjusted EBITDA ($ MM)$35.1$37.0$141.9$122.1Profit margin43.5%31.3%36.4%32.7%Adjusted EBITDA margin42.8%44.5%41.6%39.5%Non-financial performance metrics(1)Average MAUs (000s)1,2711,4881,3631,750Average DAUs (000s)619703653772ARPDAU$1.30$1.24$1.30$1.09Average monthly revenue per payer$282$279$283$245Payer conversion6.9%6.4%6.7%6.0%(1) Social casino/free-to-play games only\n\nConference Call\n\nDoubleDown will hold a conference call today (February 11, 2025) at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss these results.

Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions, and expectations of industry trends, our future financial and operating performance, and our growth plans, taking into account the information currently available to us. These statements are not statements of historical fact. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on such statements. Words such as “anticipates,” believes,” “continues,” “estimates,” “expects,” “goal,” “objectives,” “intends,” “may,” “opportunity,” “plans,” potential,” “near-term,” long-term,” “projections,” “assumptions,” “projects,” “guidance,” “forecasts,” “outlook,” “target,” “trends,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “will,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. We qualify any forward-looking statements entirely by these cautionary factors. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements for any reason or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.\n\nUse and Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with IFRS, we believe the following non-IFRS financial measure is useful in evaluating our operating performance. We present “adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization” (“Adjusted EBITDA”) because we believe it assists investors and analysts by facilitating comparison of period-to-period operational performance on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. The items excluded from the Adjusted EBITDA may have a material impact on our financial results. Certain of those items are non-recurring, while others are non-cash in nature. Accordingly, the Adjusted EBITDA is presented as supplemental disclosure and should not be considered in isolation of, as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS, and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements furnished in our report on Form 6-K filed with the SEC.\n\nIn our reconciliation from our reported IFRS “operating profit before tax” to our Adjusted EBITDA, we eliminate the impact of the following four line items: (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) finance income; (iii) finance expense; and (iv) other (income) expense. The below table sets forth the full reconciliation of our non-IFRS measures:\n\nReconciliation of non-IFRS measuresThree months ended December 31,Year ended December 31,(in millions, except percentages)2024202320242023Profit for the year$35.7$26.0$124.4$101.1Income tax expense (benefit)12.48.138.530.3Profit before tax48.134.1162.9131.3Adjustments for:Depreciation and amortization$1.1$1.3$5.2$3.5Finance income(13.4)(3.2)(29.2)(20.6)Finance expense(0.5)4.83.37.9Other (income) expense, net(0.2)0.0(0.3)0.0Adjusted EBITDA35.137.0141.9122.1Adjusted EBITDA margin42.8%44.5%41.6%39.5%\n\nThe key differences between reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin under IFRS and under GAAP arise from the treatment of certain adjustments, particularly in the areas of depreciation and amortization, finance (income), and finance expense per the respective accounting standards. For reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin under IFRS, depreciation related to right-of-use assets is included within the depreciation and amortization, and as such, is added back to Adjusted EBITDA in the reconciliation. In contrast, for reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin under GAAP, depreciation related to right-of-use assets is classified under general and administrative expenses, and thus, is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA in the reconciliation. The designation of finance (income) and finance expense in reconciliation under IFRS reflects a change in the classification of non-operating (income) expense in reconciliation under GAAP. Specifically, the non-operating (income) expense accounts under GAAP have been renamed to finance income and finance expense under IFRS.\n\nWe encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\n\nCompany Contact:\n\nJoe Sigrist\n\nir@doubledown.com\n\n+1 (206) 773-2266\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nhttps://www.doubledowninteractive.com\n\nInvestor Relations Contact:\n\nJoseph Jaffoni or Richard Land\n\nJCIR\n\n+1 (212) 835-8500\n\nDDI@jcir.com\n\nDoubleDown Interactive Co., Ltd.\n\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n\n(Unaudited, in thousands of U.S. dollars)December 31,December 31,January 1,202420232023AssetsCash and cash equivalents$334,850$206,911$217,352Short-term investments80,00067,75667,891Accounts receivable, net30,77832,51721,198Prepaid expenses, and other assets7,6148,5706,441Total current assets$453,242$315,754$312,882Property and equipment, net1,025444436Right-of-use assets, net4,3087,0723,598Intangible assets, net47,66651,57135,051Goodwill395,804396,704379,072Deferred tax asset3,37328,94759,351Other non-current assets7462,8071,463Total non-current assets$452,922$487,545$478,971Total assets$906,164$803,299$791,853Liabilities and Shareholders’ EquityAccounts payable and accrued expenses$14,990$13,293$13,830Short-term lease liabilities1,1623,1573,050Income taxes payable1,512112-Contract liabilities1,7542,5202,426Loss contingency--95,250Current portion of borrowings with related party-38,778-Other current liabilities3,96610,6451,926Total current liabilities$23,384$68,505$116,482Long-term borrowings with related party34,014-39,454Long-term lease liabilities3,5104,4201,625Deferred tax liabilities, net-848-Other non-current liabilities3,2231,6818,265Total non-current liabilities$40,747$6,949$49,344Total liabilities$64,131$75,454$165,826Shareholders’ equityShare capital21,19821,19821,198Share premium359,280359,280359,280Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)(10,603)(810)(1,432)Retained earnings472,040348,020246,981Total shareholders’ equity attributable to shareholders of DoubleDown Interactive Co.
