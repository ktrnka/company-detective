Additionally, DoubleDown has ventured into the iGaming sector through the acquisition of SuprNation, a European iGaming operator [(Make Your Jackpot Happen)](https://www.doubledowninteractive.com/).\n\nDoubleDown Interactive primarily operates in the B2C market, engaging millions of players globally through its digital gaming platforms.

This growth was partly due to the acquisition of SuprNation, which contributed **$7.9 million** to the revenue. Excluding SuprNation, the revenue still grew by **7%** to **$80.3 million**. The company's net income also rose to **$33.3 million**, compared to **$24.4 million** in Q2 2023 [(DoubleDown Interactive, 2024)](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/DDI/double-down-interactive-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-xrwgkde6fur7.html).\n\n## Acquisition of SuprNation\n\nDoubleDown completed the acquisition of SuprNation on **October 31, 2023**, for approximately **$36.5 million**.

We currently do not honor DNT signals.\n\nCalifornia âShine The Lightâ\n\nIf you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (âShine-The-Lightâ law) permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by us, or our subsidiaries or affiliates, to a third party for the third partyâs direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us as provided below. Except as may be provided in this Privacy Policy, we do not trade, sell, lease or otherwise provide any personal information regarding our users to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes.\n\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ)\n\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act) (together, the CCPA) gives California consumers enhanced rights with respect to their personal information that is collected by businesses. The CCPA provides California consumers with three rights regarding their personal information. At or before the time of collection, you have a right to receive notice of our practices, including the categories of Personal Information and any sensitive Personal Information to be collected, the purposes for which such information is collected or used, whether such information is \"sold or shared\" as defined under the CCPA and how long such information is retained. You can find those details in this Privacy Policy.\n\nFirst, California consumers can opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information with third parties under certain conditions. See below for more information.\n\nSecond, California consumers can request to know:\n\nWhat specific pieces of information a business has collected about the consumer;\n\nCategories of personal information it has collected about the consumer;\n\nCategories of sources from which the personal information is collected;\n\nCategories of personal information that the business sold or disclosed for a business purpose about the consumer;\n\nCategories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and\n\nThe business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.\n\nThird, California consumers can request that a business delete personal information about the consumer that a business has collected from the consumer and, fourth, request that their personal information be corrected.\n\nThe CCPA also prohibits covered businesses from providing discriminatory treatment to California consumers if they exercise their rights under the CCPA.\n\nIn the preceding twelve (12) months we have: (1) collected the following categories of personal information; and (2) disclosed such categories of Personal Information for a business purpose. (For the categories of third parties with whom we may disclose or sell or share Personal information, please see the section above, âInformation Sharing and Disclosureâ.)\n\nTo make a ârequest to knowâ or ârequest to deleteâ your personal information, send us an e-mail at the addresses below corresponding to the app of which you are inquiring.Â Â Please put either âRequest to Knowâ or âRequest to Deleteâ in the subject heading of your email.

We may request proof that the consumer gave the agent signed permission to submit the request.\n\nWe will confirm receipt of your request within 10 business days. We must provide the requested information or delete your personal information within 45 days of receipt of your request, but we can use up to an additional 45 days if we let you know that additional time is needed.\n\nAlso, before responding, we must verify that the person making the request is the person about whom we have collected their personal information. We may ask you to provide certain, limited personal information, such as your name and email address to verify and match your identity with our records and systems. If you have an account with us, we may ask that you verify your identity through our account authentication process. This is also to protect against fraud. We will not retain this personal information or use it for any other purpose.\n\nAlso please be advised that we need to search our records and systems only for the preceding 12 months. There may be cases where we do not have any personal information about you or we are not able to verify your identity for matching purposes. Deleting your personal information may result in the closing of your account and inability to access certain areas of Website, Apps or Services. However, you can always re-register at any time.\n\nDo Not Sell or Share Personal Information\n\nIf youâre a California resident, you have a right to opt-out from the âsaleâ or âsharingâ of your personal information with third parties who are not our service providers (as those terms are defined CCPA). Our use of personal Information to serve you interest-based advertising may constitute âsharingâ of personal information for cross-contextual behavioral advertising under the CCPA. California residents can opt out of this sharing of their personal information for this purpose. To exercise this right, click on please see this link.\n\nYou can also submit a request to opt-out by emailing us at (pertaining to the relevant app):\n\nDoubleDown Casino -Â support@doubledowncasino.com\n\nDoubleDown Fort Knox-Â support@doubledownfortknox.com\n\nDoubleDown Classic Slots -Â support@doubledownclassicslots.com\n\nEllenâs Road to Riches -Â support@doubledown.mail.helpshift.com\n\nDivine Match -Â support@divinematch3.com\n\nInclude the subject line âCalifornia Resident - Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Informationâ.\n\nYou do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use and retain Personal Information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.\n\nJob Applicants\n\nWe collect the following categories of personal information regarding job applicants:\n\nPersonal and online identifiers (such as first and last name, email address, cellphone number or unique online identifiers)\n\nCategories of information described in Section 1798.80(e) of the California Civil Code (such as physical characteristics or description, social security number, driverâs license or state identification number, address, insurance policy number, and bank account number)\n\nCharacteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (such as race or gender)\n\nInternet or other electronic network activity information (such as browsing history, search history, interactions with a website, email, application, or advertisement)\n\nGeolocation information\n\nProfessional or employment-related information\n\nEducation information\n\nInferences drawn from the above information about your predicted characteristics and preferences\n\nOther information about you that is linked to the personal information above\n\nWe use and disclose the personal information to process, evaluate and communicate with job applicants about their application and qualifications for the position applied for, to check your references and to communicate with you about other jobs for which you may be qualified.\n\nRESIDENTS IN OTHER STATES\n\nSeveral other states have enacted consumer privacy laws similar to the CCPA. Like the CCPA, these other state consumer privacy laws may provide certain privacy rights to their residents. To the extent applicable, we will honor privacy rights requests under these other US state consumer privacy laws. Please email us at (pertaining to the relevant app):\n\nDoubleDown Casino -Â support@doubledowncasino.com\n\nDoubleDown Fort Knox-Â support@doubledownfortknox.com\n\nDoubleDown Classic Slots -Â support@doubledownclassicslots.com\n\nEllenâs Road to Riches -Â support@doubledown.mail.helpshift.com\n\nDivine Match -Â support@divinematch3.com\n\nPlease also provide proof of your state residency.\n\nTHIRD PARTY WEBSITES\n\nThe Sites may contain links to several other websites, content or services that are owned or controlled by third parties and not DoubleDown.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE TERMS OF USE INCLUDE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION WHICH REQUIRES THAT ANY PAST, PENDING, OR FUTURE DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US SHALL BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL AND NOT A CLASS-WIDE OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION ON A RETROACTIVE BASIS, YOU MAY OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISION WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS BY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED AT THE END OF THE SECTION TITLED \"BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS WAIVER.\"\n\nAcceptance of Terms\n\nThese terms and conditions of use (\"Terms of Use\") constitute a legal agreement that governs your relationship with DoubleDown Interactive LLC and its affiliated companies (collectively referred to as \"DoubleDown\" or \"We\" or âusâ) regarding your use of DoubleDown's social games and related services, which include applications for mobile devices and DoubleDown-branded Web sites (the âServices\"). These Terms of Use apply to any Services provided by or Site operated by DoubleDown, including, without limitation, the DoubleDown casino located at www.doubledowncasino.com or any other sites on which these Terms of Use are posted, and/or where any DoubleDown application, Services, or product is licensed, downloaded or otherwise accessed through third party sites or sources (in each case, the âSiteâ).\n\nBy registering with, using or otherwise accessing the Services, including browsing the Site, accessing the Services with a mobile device or installing software obtained from the Site, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, accepted and agreed to be bound by these Terms of Use and any other terms and conditions referenced and incorporated herein, including, without limitation, the Privacy Policy referenced herein (\"Privacy Policy\").

The Privacy Policy governs any personal information you provide to us.Â By using the Services or accessing the Site you agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy.\n\nBinding Arbitration and Class Waiver\n\nPLEASE READ THESE \"BINDING ARBITRATION\" AND \"CLASS WAIVER\" PROVISIONS CAREFULLY, BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE ALL DISPUTES WITH DOUBLEDOWN AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. WHILE YOU MUST AGREE TO THESE PROVISIONS AS TO ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, THERE IS AN OPTION, DESCRIBED BELOW, TO OPT OUT THE ARBITRATION AND CLASS WAIVER PROVISIONS. THE OPTION TO OPT-OUT IS TIME-LIMITED TO THIRTY (30) DAYS AND REQUIRES YOUR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.\n\nTHESE PROVISIONS GENERALLY PRECLUDE YOU FROM BRINGING ANY CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION AGAINST DOUBLEDOWN. THEY ALSO PRECLUDE YOU FROM PARTICIPATING IN OR RECOVERING RELIEF UNDER ANY PAST, PENDING, OR FUTURE CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION AGAINST DOUBLEDOWN BY SOMEONE ELSE. ARBITRATION PRECLUDES YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.\n\nScope of Arbitration Provision. You and DoubleDown agree that any past, pending, or future dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to your access to or use of any DoubleDown Site (including Services) or to these Terms of Use (including without limitation any dispute concerning the breach, enforcement, construction, validity, interpretation, enforceability, or arbitrability of these Terms of Use) (a \"Dispute\"), shall be determined by arbitration, except that you and DoubleDown are NOT required to arbitrate any Dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.\n\nWaiver of Class Relief. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you agree that you and DoubleDown will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding. You and DoubleDown are each waiving respective rights to participate in a class action. By accepting this agreement, you give up your right to participate in any past, pending or future class action or any other consolidated or representative proceeding, including any existing as of the date you agreed to these terms of use.\n\nWhether to agree to arbitration is an important decision. It is your decision to make and you are not required to rely solely on the information provided in these terms of use. You should take reasonable steps to conduct further research and to consult with counsel (at your expense) regarding the consequences of your decision.\n\nOPTION TO OPT OUT. YOU MAY OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION PROVISIONS BY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT OPT-OUT, THESE TERMS WILL APPLY RETROACTIVELY TO ALL CLAIMS YOU MAY POSSESS, WHETHER ASSERTED TO DATE OR NOT.\n\nPROCEDURE TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO AGREE TO THIS ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER AGREEMENT, YOU MUST, WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF ENTERING THIS AGREEMENT, SEND AN E-MAIL TO ARBITRATIONOPTOUT@DOUBLEDOWN.COM CONTAINING YOUR FULL NAME, ADDRESS, AND THE WORDS âOPT OUTâ IN THE BODY OR SUBJECT LINE OF THE EMAIL.\n\nLocation of Arbitration and Applicable Rules. You and DoubleDown agree that such arbitration shall occur in Seattle, Washington. You may request to appear in such proceedings telephonically. You and DoubleDown agree that such arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ), as modified by these Terms of Use.\n\nAuthority of Arbitrator. With the exception of class procedures and remedies as discussed above under \"Waiver of Class Relief,\" the arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.\n\nConfidentiality. You and DoubleDown shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceedings and the arbitration award, including the arbitration hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.\n\nAllocation of Arbitration Fees. If you assert a Dispute as an individual, you will only be required to pay arbitration fees of $250 in connection with any arbitration under this section, and DoubleDown will bear all other costs charged by AAA or the arbitrator up to $5,000. You will still be responsible for paying your own attorneysâ fees.\n\nYou and DoubleDown agree that any claims or lawsuits, regardless of form, arising out of or related to the Site (including Services) or these Terms of Use or Privacy Policy must BE FILED within ONE (1) YEAR of the action, omission, event or occurrence giving rise to the claim or suit, after which such claims will be time-barred and prohibited, without regard to any longer period of time which may be provided by any period of limitation or repose by law or statute. Each party shall bear its own costs in the arbitration proceeding. If any portion of this section entitled \"Binding Arbitration and Class Waiver\" is determined by a court to be inapplicable or invalid, then the remainder shall still be given full force and effect.\n\nRight to Use and Limitations on Use\n\nSubject to your agreement and continued compliance with the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, DoubleDown grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable limited right to access and use the Services through a supported Web browser or mobile device solely for your own non-commercial, entertainment purposes.\n\nYou represent and warrant that you have full right and authority to use the Services and to be bound by these Terms of Use.

Knowingly submitting incomplete or inaccurate information may result in immediate termination of your participation and forfeiture of any Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods to which you are otherwise entitled, at DoubleDown's sole discretion, to the extent legally permissible.\n\nSubscriptions\n\nSome of DoubleDownâs Sites may offer the ability to purchase subscription services. If you purchase a subscription, then by clicking the purchase button you are requesting that DoubleDown begin supplying the subscription services immediately and are entering into a monthly subscription contract with us. You are also authorizing a charge to you of a monthly subscription fee at the rate quoted at the time of purchase. For subscription services purchased using Services or Sites played on a platform such as Facebook, Apple or Google, the platform will charge you for the subscription fee and the platformâs payment terms will apply. Please review the appropriate platformâs payment terms for additional information.\n\nSubscription rates are based on an amount in U.S. Dollars. The charges will be applied to the payment instrument you provide when you start your subscription (or to a different payment instrument, if you change your account information). Please note that prices and charges are subject to change, and in such instance, we will let you know in advance.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew each month unless and until you terminate your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews each month, otherwise payment of the next month's subscription fees will be taken automatically via your chosen payment method.\n\nYou may cancel at any time directly through the platform for games played on a platform. For each platform, please review their customer support websites or contact their customer support numbers for information regarding canceling auto-renewing subscriptions.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS, EXCEPT FOR EU CUSTOMERS THAT CANCEL WITHIN 14 DAYS OF THEIR INITIAL PURCHASE, AS EXPLAINED BELOW.\n\nIf you reside in the European Union, subscription services may be cancelled within 14 days from the date of your purchase and you may obtain a refund of your initial payment minus a reasonable pro-rated portion to cover your use of the subscription service prior to cancellation. Please refer to the relevant platformâs payment terms relevant to subscriptions for more information on exercising this cancellation right.\n\nDoubleDown may occasionally offer a one-time or limited-time bonus to players that have a current subscription or who agree to start a subscription. You understand that these items will not be a part of your ongoing subscription.\n\nVirtual Currency\n\nThe Services may include a virtual, in-game currency (\"Virtual Currency\") including, but not limited to chips, coins, cash, credits, tokens, metals, or points, that may be purchased through the Services for \"real world\" money if you are legally permitted to purchase such Virtual Currency in your country, province, jurisdiction and/or state of residence. The Services may also include virtual, in-game digital items (\"Virtual Goods\") that may be purchased through the Services for \"real world\" money (if you are legally permitted to purchase such Virtual Goods in your country, province, jurisdiction and/or state of residence) or for Virtual Currency. Regardless of the terminology used, Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods may never be redeemed for \"real world\" money, goods or other items of monetary value from DoubleDown or any other party. Prices and availability of Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods are subject to change without notice. Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods may only be purchased or acquired from us and through means we provide on the applicable website or otherwise expressly authorize. We reserve the right to refuse your request to purchase and/or acquire Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods for any reason. Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods may only be held by legal residents of jurisdictions where access to and use of the Services are permitted. Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods may only be purchased or acquired through means specifically authorized by DoubleDown. When you purchase Virtual Currency, it will reside in your DoubleDown account until discharged through use of the Services or otherwise surrendered as a result of termination of the Services in accordance with these Terms of Use. In certain circumstances and to facilitate offline play, your Virtual Currency may be stored on your mobile device, and in such instance such Virtual Currency cannot be used from any other source. Further, in certain circumstances Virtual Currency stored on a mobile device may not be transferred to another device, and unless otherwise prohibited by law, DoubleDown shall have no obligation to you if such Virtual Currency is not transferred.\n\nOther than a limited, personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable license to use the Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency with the Services, you have no right or title in or to any such Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency appearing or originating with the Services, or any other attributes associated with use of the Services or stored within the Services. DoubleDown has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate such Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods as it sees fit in its sole discretion to the extent legally permissible, and DoubleDown shall have no liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights. In addition to the foregoing, DoubleDown may selectively remove or revoke Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods associated with your account.\n\nThe transfer of Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to do so is in violation of these Terms of Use and may result in a lifetime ban from the Services and possible legal action.\n\nYou understand and agree that all sales of Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods are final and that DoubleDown is not required to provide a refund for any reason. All Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods are forfeited if your account is terminated or suspended for any reason, in DoubleDown's sole and absolute discretion, or if the Services are no longer available. To the extent legally permissible, if your account, or a particular subscription for the Service associated with your account, is terminated, suspended and/or if any Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods are selectively removed or revoked from your account, no refund will be granted, no Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods will be credited to you or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement.\n\nIntellectual Property Ownership\n\nDoubleDown and its licensors retain all rights in the content within the Services (including, but not limited to, applications, software, designs, graphics, texts, information, pictures, video, sound, music, and other files, and their selection and arrangement) (collectively, the \"Content\").

      "# [Welcome to DoubleDown Interactive](https://www.doubledowninteractive.com/responsible-play/index.html)\nResponsible gameplay\n\nWhat is Responsible Gameplay?\n\nThere are a wide variety of reasons why people enjoy playing video games, including to have fun, pass the time, and encourage relaxation. Regardless of your reason for playing, we want to ensure we're providing you with a safe, enjoyable experience. That includes a place to play responsibly, set limits or take a break. Playing video games can be a fun part of a balanced life, but DoubleDown Interactive recognizes that there can be too much of a good thing.\n\nWhile we offer social casino-style games, these games are not gambling, and do not offer the opportunity to win real money or prizes.

If you have more than 10k, it changes your minimum to 200k! How do I know? I was on a game playing a bet of 50k and then switched out to another game where I won enough to be over just over 10k.

They claim that their odds of winning are the same as real slots, but real slots don't force you to up your minimum bet. If you have less than 10k, you can adjust your bet to lower amounts. If you have more than 10k, it changes your minimum to 200k! How do I know? I was on a game playing a bet of 50k and then switched out to another game where I won enough to be over just over 10k.

      "# Post ID 1540x0o: DoubleDown Casino Class Action Settlement with +32 score by [(kookyrobin, Reddit, 2023-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/)\nAnybody? The settlement received final approval on 6/1/23. According to the settlement website, settlement class members with valid claims should receive payment within 90 days after the settlement has been finally approved and/or after any appeals process is complete, which is at least 120 days after final approval - to my understanding, this would mean early October unless the administrators file for a continuation of the deadline. Has anyone had contact with the settlement administrators with any follow-up information? It's my understanding the next step will be determination letters being sent to claimants...\n\n## Comment ID k238b0g with +15 score by [(LogicalCustard7290, Reddit, 2023-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k238b0g/) (in reply to ID 1540x0o):\nOMG reading some of these posts really give me an insight into how ungfateful some people are\n\n1.  this lawsuit started with a handful of people and lawyers doing all the heavy lifti\n2. the majority of us found out earlier this year we could participate if we wanted too\n3. prior to that initial notification 99% of us were not getting a dime back and didn’t even know it was a possibility\n4. now people are complaining about percentages on refunds, why is it Tuesda instead of Wednesday etc etc etc\n5. be thankful you are getting a portion back regardless of the amount because prior to the initial card we received earlier this year you where getting NOTHING\n\n### Comment ID k28e49s with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k28e49s/) (in reply to ID k238b0g):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID k29iq1s with +6 score by [(kekeforever22, Reddit, 2023-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k29iq1s/) (in reply to ID k28e49s):\nGA saved my life.

I emailed Edelson right after I filed my claim in early April and someone responded within 24 hours. They gave a standard reply and asked if I would like for someone to call me. I said yes and received a phone call later that day. I have been in touch with the same rep since then and she always responds by the next business day. Like everyone else, I get the same standard response, but I understand that they really aren't allowed to tell us much. I work with attorneys and I know they are sticklers for being very cautious what you tell people because it can come back to bite you if it turns out to be wrong. The good news is that this process has moved quickly compared to other settlements. I read about the Big Fish Settlement and they requested a 60 day extension of time to get payments out because of all the challenges. \n\nI agree that it seems like the attorneys got a lot of money, but they did all the work and without them we wouldn't be getting ANYTHING, so I really don't have a problem with it. I'm just grateful to be getting something back!!!!\n\n#### Comment ID k29gabk with +3 score by [(StandardAd9831, Reddit, 2023-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k29gabk/) (in reply to ID k28e49s):\nAntosr66..... All attorneys are the same way that's how they make their money. Usually cap amount on class action suits are around 25%.  Have an injury attorney You're looking at 40% easy. You may have read the important documents on their website but if you want to do some heavy reading go to Pacer. Thousands and thousands and thousands of pages from both sides.

WildRefrigerator should really spend some time reading the actual court documents instead of half reading and coming here giving incorrect information (such as payment % info etc). 🙄.

I hope that statement includes YOURSELF; I saw your post stating you played under multiple accounts using different credit cards until you were kicked off. Yikes! But “LMBO”\nSigh. Can’t make this stuff up folks. \n\nWhat document? It didn’t say anything about postcards. Postcards were mailed out to all eligible class members. Emails were also sent out. They have to notify members using the proper channels (all class action suits do this). In the documents, had you bothered to read, it stated everyone with a LSA over $100 received a postcard/email notification of the lawsuit. \nDollar amount over $100k had absolutely nothing to do with it. \n\nTo your point, this will be over in 8 days.\n\n### Comment ID k26de2a with +3 score by [(StandardAd9831, Reddit, 2023-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k26de2a/) (in reply to ID k260q6f):\nBlunt and to the point Touche!

I’m a gambler, both at real casinos and these just for fun apps. Until last week, I had 45 casino apps on my computer, and just logging in daily and collecting chips and spins from friends took 45 minutes to an hour everyday. Then a few times during the day to collect some more chips. I was spending hours playing these games, but having fun doing it. What brought me, and all of you, to the situation we’re in, is that DD does NOT let you win. You all gamble and like to play to win, but you can’t win with DD, so you lose all your chips, then have to buy more to keep the fun going. And it never ends! It goes on for years, hence the reason we’ve spent the outrageous amounts we have. I’ve been playing DD since the beginning (13, 14 years??) and I’m only on level 21, and I spent over $28K!! Yikes!! By comparison, I’ve been playing Slotomania for the same 13, 14 years, but I’m on level 27,663. Big difference. Out of all 45 games I play, DD is the ONLY one I’ve ever purchased chips for. The ONLY ONE! And again, that’s because DD does NOT pay. They turn the winnings on and off but insist it’s all random. It is not. A few years ago, I started the week with maybe 200K chips; 6 days later, I had over 9 billion, my highest amount since I started playing. Every game I was getting bonus after bonus after bonus. Then on day 7, poof, it stopped. Lost it all. I believe, actually I’m CONVINCED, the person in charge of flipping the on/off switch was on vacation and left it in the on position. There’s no other explanation, and again, I’ve been playing since the beginning. The problem is DD has all the IGT games I play in the real casino: Bombay, Stinkin Rich, Treasures of Troy, White Orchids, Wolf Run, etc. But as I said, lightbulb moment! Never again will I spend real money to buy fake chips. Never! And I hope you all learned your lesson as well. There’s tons of games out there that REALLY are free. Just stick with them. Thank you for letting me get this off my chest. I feel better already!! 🥰\n\n### Comment ID jzbw4xn with +2 score by [(Reasonable_Medium_18, Reddit, 2023-09-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/jzbw4xn/) (in reply to ID jywaxgj):\nWhat socks for me, is I can't remember the email I originally used to sign up, so I got told my lifetime spending amount is only 2.99, and I know I spent a LOT more.

I will admit that I have not read all the posted documents on the claims site and came across JND’s Declaration of Administration dated 2 May. It states, “As of May 2, 2023 JND has received a total of 130,765 timely claims, 129,229 online and 1,536 by mail or email. In JND’s preliminary review, it is estimated that the total Lifetime Spending Amount (LSA) of the claims received to date is approximately $594,423,645.63.” They also stated that of the 129,229 claims, they believe about 40,000 were spam. (Did the LSA they approximated at around $594 Million include the spam??? Who knows)  \nBut taking into consideration that the lawyer fees were about $121 Million and the settlement was for $415 Million, that leaves about $294 Million for the eligible claims that they sent notices to with their LSA. Rounding up the total LSA for all claims received by 2 May to $600 Million and with $294 Million to disperse to all eligible claims, the percentage would be around 49% payback “Just looking at the Total LSA of all claims vs the amount of money to disperse”. (294/600=49)  \nThey have stated payments of 60% for any amounts over $100,000, 30% for $10,000.01 - $100,000, 17.5% for amounts between $1000.01 - $10,000 and 1% between ,01 - $1,000.  \nSo, the payment estimator that is posted on their website might just be correct. I assume that there are numerous claims with a LSA under $10,000 as well as numerous claims over $100,000 with the rest in the middle ( 10,000.01 - $100,000)  \n**Now it is time to watch College Football and not think about DDC! 2 years sober!!**\n\n### Comment ID k1vwpp3 with +3 score by [(LazSlate, Reddit, 2023-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k1vwpp3/) (in reply to ID k1uv7ne):\nWeird how they allocate the money.

If your LTS is $99,990 you would get 30% but if you spent $11 more it would be 60%.\n\n#### Comment ID k1x0urv with +8 score by [(KangarooIll7000, Reddit, 2023-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k1x0urv/) (in reply to ID k1vwpp3):\nThe reason for this, as I have read In the documents, is that anyone with the high spending, have had their lives impacted negatively to much greater degree than someone who was playing every so often. They have been distanced from their family and racked up debt and guilt. Lower spenders would carry a much lesser burden.\n\n#### Comment ID k1w38hi with +2 score by [(PartyKiwiGirl, Reddit, 2023-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k1w38hi/) (in reply to ID k1vwpp3):\nNot quite.  Amounts over 100,000 will get the 60%.  So that .99¢ (the amount over $100,000) will get 60%.  Not the whole total amount of the LTS.\n\nSo really—the person who spent 99,990 should get almost the same as the person who spent 100,001.00. The person who spent 100,001.00 would get approximately a dollar or so more.

This settlement will literally change my life.  I have endlessly researched the taxability of this payment and still am not clear.  I spoke to an accountant who said that most likely despite the settlement being as we consider a “refund” the bank will report the large deposit and we can be hit with taxes and penalties.  I’m still searching and will report any findings.  I’m so disappointed in myself but feel that this settlement will undoubtedly help and I learned a very expensive lesson.

This game is almost like hypnosis, it’s sucks you in and gets your money. It doesn’t hit you until you’re out of coins and have spent a lot of money, then you realize the magnitude of what you’ve done. You take a break from the game only to return with a limit to spend on coins but it goes all out the window when you lose all of your coins and want more. It’s like a cycle. I’ve been there and would have probably spent $1mm if I had that kind of money. I hope you get most of your money back.

I too, am worried about the taxes. Many are saying it's a refund and not taxable but I don't want to get sideways with the IRS and have to pay a penalty if I don't pay taxes that are due. I will probably try to contact someone at the IRS after I get my payment just to see what I can find out. I wish you luck and hope you get a big payout!

There will likely be a second distribution of a much lesser amount due to members that can not be found and forfeit their funds.That will be split accordingly with the other members. Some of this info is available on DoubleDownSettlelement.com under important documents. This is not carved in stone but is from the research I have done.

It was stated that the more you spent the more you will get back.  I would use the formula with your own personal spending amount and see what you get.  Based on the example of the formula, that amount is lower than what the estimator scale has for the low end of the range.  In the estimator if you slide to $40,000 you get a range of $12,434 - $31,086 but with the formula using $40,000 spent it estimates $8,273.  Remember with the formula the calculated amount is then discounted.

It also mentions the second payment if also being $8273. But reading it all, I am confused by that. Since they know the associated claims are at least 590,000.000. and change, there is in my mind no other payments to be made since the claims are much higher than settlement.

According to a lawyer who has past experience with class action settlements says this is a big payout for 90,000 people. $300 million will be dispursed after attorney fees and administrative fees are deducted from the $415 million.

Then there are percentages of your total lifetime spending added on to that. The more you spend, the higher the percentage. One of the recent legal documents says 50-60% or more for those who spent the most, near the $100K mark. Those over $100K are not on the payment calculator but I bet it will be very high. If mine is correct, I should get $35-72K. This is just crazy! Who would ever have thought you'd get money back playing a stupid addictive game that you knew you were not winning at.

I have used it for over 10 years now and it is not always correct. Sometimes you will get a piece of mail that was not part of the email they send you showing what you are supposed to get that day. Sometimes Informed Delivery will say you are supposed to get a piece of mail and it does not get delivered for a few days. So check your mailbox every day no matter what USPS Informed delivery said.\n\nAnother note with regards to checks being mailed. Normal times are 1-5 business days for 1st class mail. Per JND's policy for checks not received, they will wait 30 days before they determine that the check was not delivered and cashed before the reissue of another check.

I received this from Edelson on Friday in response to my request to know what the funds we will be receiving are classified as.  As most of us feel it is a refund of our money that was taxed before we paid it to Doubledown we shouldn’t be taxed on it again.  This doesn’t truly define of the taxability of our payments but could be helpful for our accountants to see.  This is in the court documents of this action:\n\nIf you look at the \"First Cause of Action,\" at paragraph 47, you'll see the following allegation: \"The state of Washington’s “Recovery of money lost at gambling” statute, RCW 4.24.070, provides that “all persons losing money or anything of value at or on any illegal gambling games shall have a cause of action to recover from the dealer or player winning, or from the proprietor for whose benefit such game was played or dealt, or such money or things of value won, the amount of the money or the value of the thing so lost.”\n\n#### Comment ID jv9o0c4 with +2 score by [(kookyrobin, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/jv9o0c4/) (in reply to ID jv84jf2):\nThank you for sharing!\n\n#### Comment ID jvu0r2j with +2 score by [(StandardAd9831, Reddit, 2023-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/jvu0r2j/) (in reply to ID jv84jf2):\nWill the challenges hold up checks for people who didn't challenge\n\n## Comment ID jxlyl1j with +4 score by [(CryptographerNew7491, Reddit, 2023-08-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/jxlyl1j/) (in reply to ID 1540x0o):\nWas anyone in on the Big Fish Settlement?

I knew I was spending a lot, but when I went back and added it all up I was just sick. So much money that I could have used for much better things. Plus, I stupidly went into debt using credit cards to play. I found myself buying \"just one more\" package so many times. The games are very addictive. When I looked back over my purchases I could easily tell that when I was spending the most were times when I was going through major life difficulties and grief from loss of loved ones. While I know the choices to play and spend money were my own, I believe DD was preying on people like me who were looking for escape from reality. They let you win a little, then you start making higher bets and trying to play the side games and challenges, and when you get close to completing a challenge, you start losing so you buy more chips thinking you'll win that extra little jackpot. The odds in Vegas are much better than DD, yet I found myself playing more and more, even knowing I wasn't going to win. This addiction is as bad as drugs or alcohol - it's hard to stop once you start playing. I loved playing the games, and I wouldn't even mind paying a small fee to play, such as a small monthly fee for unlimited coins or something, but it's not worth it after realizing just how much I spent. As a higher spender I'm hoping to get at least half my money back, and I will use that to pay off my debts and then I intend to \"pay it forward\" by helping out a couple of family members who are going through some hard times (they weren't playing this stupid game!). The rest will go into a savings account toward my retirement fund!\n\nI hope everyone gets a very nice payout and I'm praying for anyone who is or has been struggling with this or any other addiction!\n\n#### Comment ID k1hm0md with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k1hm0md/) (in reply to ID k1h29hs):\nEverything you said here is accurate. Over the 12 or 13 years I've played DD, I was shocked to see my lifetime spending. To me, it was only a few hundred a month. I don't spend money on anything for myself so I justified it. I also used to go to a real casino many of those years and was wasting money there too. I finally banned myself from the real casino because I knew I was becoming addicted. DDC is just as addictive. I played it at night, in the only quiet time I get. Played more when I was stressed out over family issues too. Anyway, I think we all know gambling is addictive and if you have an addictive personality, you can get in real trouble. I have not even told my husband about this settlement. He knows I played a game online, a lot, cause he could see the debits on my account. Now, if we get a big payout,  he's not even gonna believe this is real. I'm having a hard time believing it myself. But it will be nice if we get a big check and learn our lesson from it. Since I saw my lifetime spending total, I have only bought chips on DD twice. But after seeing this thread and how many people are just like me, embarassed about this, I am going to go home and block my account so I am unable to make in-app purchases. You can do it by creating a pin. Just make something up that you won't remember and you will never be able to make in-app purchases again.\n\n#### Comment ID k1ibv4d with +5 score by [(korisanzz, Reddit, 2023-09-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k1ibv4d/) (in reply to ID k1h29hs):\nHow the hell did we spend so much on absolutely nothing??

There are so many that are not valid. Reddit does not have moderators that will filter out the bad posts on this site so read with caution.\n\nPosts about money not available at Citibank, or that Citibank will not release funds until the 19th, checks getting bounced back for non payment by Citibank are all SPAM!\n\nJND has stated that there are no problems with Citibank releasing money or paying the claims. If you have a valid check from Citibank it will not bounce. The only hiccups are some of the direct deposits with the wrong banking information. These are typically typo's by either the claimant or JND.\n\nThe other concern is the bank hold. Even if you have funds in your account that are greater than the check you are trying to cash or deposit, most banks will put a hold on that check until it is cleared.  The time frame for hold depends on the bank, each has their own rules for checks like the ones we got (Settlement Check).  This is a quote from the Banking System (U.S.)\n\n\"Every year, money hungry thieves issue millions of counterfeit checks worth billions of dollars. Annually, about half a million Americans become the victim of scams involving fake or counterfeit checks, and the Better Business Bureau (BBB) reports that victims lose an average of $1,200 each.\"\n\n## Comment ID k8z6fwg with +3 score by [(x-Not_Spartacus-x, Reddit, 2023-11-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k8z6fwg/) (in reply to ID 1540x0o):\n$36K squandered. $16K retrieved.

I have noticed that they definitely are being tightlipped and sticking to a \"script.\" I get it though, they certainly don't want to put out the wrong information.

The final document filed on 6/1/2023 ,(doc 549 p.3 #5)  states: The Parties are directed to proceed with the Settlement procedures specified under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, including payment and prospective relief.  That was completely ignored . The reply said it will be at least 120 days after June 1,2023.(That message was in all capitals.)

Please note this is copied and pasted.  And from Charles Peng.   You go by what Edelson tells you unless they change (anticipated vs. certainty at this point). The green box should have been updated by now to confirm the payment date if it is 100% confirmed but it has not been done so and seems to be delay. Something likely is causing a holdup that has not been disclosed. If there is new information it would either be publicly released or at least someone will get a release from Edelson whether email or call. The multiplier is both closely guarded as well as give leeway in case of last minute changes like calculation error. The hint you got from Edelson/administrator is that multiplier will be higher than 1.16 (fall within range of calculator estimate and everyone will at minimum get their base payment) is that is only guarantee at this point. You can get multiplier from first payout. What you get divided by your calculated base payment based on plan of allocation = multiplier for everyone (up to 100% refund. Exception is people who hit 100% refund). It is only 1 more week of waiting though I feel like people are getting more anxious.\n\n### Comment ID k2d2s5x with +2 score by [(kekeforever22, Reddit, 2023-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k2d2s5x/) (in reply to ID k2coyzk):\nThank you for posting this!\nWell I think Charles once again has good information here.

I read that they were planning to have them resolved by September 8, but then I saw that someone was told last week that they are still working on them.

The lady read the last four digits of my account number to me BEFORE I told her the rest of the info.  My wife was on speaker phone with me looking at the account info, and they verified it was correct.  Then the week of October 3rd, when everyone was getting their deposits, I didn't get anything.  Waited til Thursday and called them and they said it was sent on October 3rd, and they verified the account info again.  They said I'd have to email requesting a re-issue, but with no further information.  I emailed and asked what went wrong and requested the reissue and gave them the bank information again. No reply....Waited til Monday and finally called the law office directly and had to leave a voicemail.  Thankfully the nice lady at the law office called back 30 minutes later and said she would look into it.  An hour later the administrators email me back with this Bullsh\\_\\_!!!    \n\n\n\"Your ACH direct deposit was issued on October 3, but was unsuccessful. Your payment information has been updated accordingly, as the information below is not the information provided on your claim form. Reissues are sent every 2 to 3 weeks.\"    \n\n\nWhat the hell would I have provided \"initially\"??  I only have one bank account that I use, and when I submitted my initial claim, I literally copied and pasted the routing number and account number from my bank account online portal, and then checked again to make sure it was accurate so exactly THIS did not happen.  Like, now I'm worried that they are gonna fat thumb it again and I have to wait another \"2 to 3 weeks\" for them to F\\_\\_ it up again.  I left a voicemail with the law office again to ask them to help make sure they get it right the next time.  And what's up with 2 to 3 weeks?  Just re-send it, a-holes, do you have a strict schedule for re-issuing payments or something?    \n\n\nSorry for the rant, but they assured me two weeks ago that they were depositing this money and I stupidly planned to have the money last week (yes, I know, don't ever count the money til' it's in the bank, but man, they said it would be deposited, so I believed them).\n\n#### Comment ID k4kd48f with +2 score by [(joeblawrence, Reddit, 2023-10-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k4kd48f/) (in reply to ID k4ifetk):\nso did you finally get your $$$$$????? waiting for mine\n\n#### Comment ID k4rx1v1 with +2 score by [(jen_kins, Reddit, 2023-10-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k4rx1v1/) (in reply to ID k4ifetk):\nI’m in the same boat, “ACH was unsuccessful” after 2 confirmations.

If only 0.5% of the 90,000 claims had a lifetime spending amount of $101,000 (60% base amount) then 4,500 people will get $272,700,000 based on the plan of allocation. (Higher amounts spent receive more). The legal fees are around $121,000,000. Which means that \"IF\" there were 4,500 people that spent over the $100,000 LSA the amounts will have to be calculated to give a lot less than that stupid calculator they have in the important documents section. My guess is that those that spent over $100,000 will get around 30% back and those that had a LSA between $10,001 and $100,000 will get 17.5% back and the rest will get 1% back.\n\nOf course this is all based on how many spent over $100,000. From reading through several forums it seems like a lot have. Or so they say they have. Someone on this site has claimed spending over $1 Million. A 60% base payout for him/her would take $600,000 out of the funds to be distributed.\n\n### Comment ID k0s3d4d with +2 score by [(StandardAd9831, Reddit, 2023-09-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k0s3d4d/) (in reply to ID k0mme6h):\nI don't think you did the plan of allocation right\n\n\n\n### Comment ID k0n80l0 with +1 score by [(kleen2thrdh, Reddit, 2023-09-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classactions/comments/1540x0o/doubledown_casino_class_action_settlement/k0n80l0/) (in reply to ID k0mme6h):\nSo because my LSA isn’t quite 10k ($9991), I’m only getting back 1%? $99?

Yes, I was a very high spender and my refund was quite significant.  I pray that we all have learned from this experience because I do believe that this was a “once in a lifetime gift” and we should never take it for granted. All those nights I sat up playing and saying to myself “nobody else can be doing this because it’s insanity”.  But reading so many of the posts actually made me feel better in a terrible way.  What we did to ourselves was horrible and this settlement is a miracle.  I can only speak for myself and say that I will NEVER be in debt again.  Before DD I NEVER carried a penny of debt so at this age to suddenly owe so much was overwhelming.  I have paid everything already and am debt free once again.  There are no words to describe this weight being lifted off my shoulders.

      "# Post ID xkpwho: Double Down Interactive Lawsuit Settlement Catalyst Update with +3 score by [(ChiefValue, Reddit, 2022-09-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContrarianStocks/comments/xkpwho/double_down_interactive_lawsuit_settlement/)\n DDI generates meaningful FCF with a sticky customer base and has been an effective app developer, maintaining a leading app by gross income for a decade. A short term headwind in the form of a class action lawsuit coupled with the current market conditions has made DDI trade at a significant discount to intrinsic value.  \n\n\nDouble Down Interactive Co, Ltd. is an online casino app developer that offers in app purchases for chips and pays out in chips. However, unlike normal casinos, DDI does not payout any actual money. The chips that players buy are entirely worthless and are a virtual currency restricted to the app. DDI operates a variety of casino slot games though a consolidated app portfolio to keep engagement tight and to streamline new games through a small number of apps. The strategy is to maintain one main app while updating the casino games on the app every 10-12 days. This allows the app to show up on the charts as popular and to make users more likely to keep using the single app. This is opposed to the more cyclical model of most video game and app developers that requires more marketing spend and risk. DDI is developing other games in the action and puzzle genres but <95% of revenues come from the social casino apps. DDI is a South Korean company that is traded on the NASDAQ as an ADR that represents 5% of a common share. (All per share numbers account for this.) DDI had it's IPO in September of 2021 and has since fallen 38% to $10/sh.  \n\n\nEven though the company's headquarters is in South Korea, 87% of revenue comes from the U.S. and a large portion of the development team are English speakers from the U.S. working out of the Seattle, Washington office.  \n\n\nDDI is a quality business with a 32% EBITDA margin and low CapEx requirements. CapEx as a % of cash from operations is in the sub 0.5% range. Gross margins remain stable around 65% as the largest cost in COGS is the 30% standard fee charged on in-app purchases from the app stores.  \n\n\nThe average revenue per daily active user is $0.97 compared to the $0.67 from the social casino peer group. This is mainly due to the high payer conversion rate of 5.2%. These numbers are made more impressive by the sticky customer base of which 92% of revenue is generated from 2010-2020 cohorts as of Q2 2022. This amounts to a loyal player base that also demonstrates a willingness to continue to pay, providing consistent cash flows for the business. A player acquisition payback period of under 200 days since 2017 shows a sustainable path to drive growth in an uncostly and low risk fashion.  \n\n\nCovid-19 increased revenues by 30% in 2020 from $273M to $358M. DDI is on track to generate approximately $332M of revenue in 2022. The payer conversion rate has dropped from 5.8% in 2Q21 back down to the normalized 5.2% rate in 2Q22 and the quarterly revenue declines have flattened, signaling that the sticky player base and quality engagement model has captured organic growth over the last two years.  \n\n\nThe largest risk factor was the class action lawsuit that was filed In 2018 for misleading players and not properly displaying the user agreement. This required DDI to build a cash reserve and refrain from any major value producing activities. Illiquidity and Covid-19 beneficiary status have also added to DDI being overlooked. However, the lawsuit was settled on Aug 29th and the mean reversion of earnings seems to have completed leaving little reason for the large discount. The details of the lawsuit are as follows,  \n\n\nDDI operates Free To Play (FTP) games that have in app transactions. Players start with free chips and then upon losing them have to reload their chip count with real money. It was argued that DDI intentionally hid the user agreement in an obscure part of the app in order to coerce players into paying for chips even though it was as advertised as FTP.  \n\n\n\"Subject to final court approval of the settlement of the Benson v. DoubleDown Interactive LLC, et. al. lawsuit, IGT and DoubleDown have also resolved all indemnification and other claims between themselves and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates relating to the Benson Matters. As a result of the settlement agreement, DoubleDown will accrue a $70.25 million expense in the third quarter of 2022 related to the incremental loss associated with the Benson Matters and related claims between IGT and DoubleDown and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. To date, DoubleDown has already accrued a total of $75 million in expenses related to the Benson Matters.\" - DDI  \n\n\nThis issue has since been addressed and measures have been taken to prevent this from happening again.  \n\n\nThe 145m that DDI has to pay for the settlement amounts to \\~18 months of FCF. Far better than the valuation would assume. Adjusting for the settlement charges, the new Enterprise Value is 576m. Using a normalized 2019 EBITDA for a conservative demonstration, gives an EV/EBITDA = 5.75. DDI will also still have a net cash position post settlement keeping the margin of safety intact.  \n\n\nPlaytika (PLTK), the closest and largest peer to DDI in the social casino space, trades at an EV/EBITDA of 10.75 and a FCF yield of 11%. With recent consolidation in the gaming space, the fact that PLTK is about 9x the mkt cap of DDI and has about 4x the FCF, it is possible that they could be a potential bidder in the near future, especially now that the legal troubles facing DDI have been resolved. PLTK also has an EBITDA margin of 38% compared to DDI's 33%, this may be seen as an opportunity for margin expansion through synergistic cost savings.  \n\n\nWith a social casino market annual growth rate of 4-5%, DDI is looking to expand into other gaming genres while utilizing the already in place development pipeline. This allows for relatively low cost opportunities to expand and diversify outside of the space into the remaining $143bn mobile games market.  \n\n\nWith the resolution of the lawsuit, it will allow DDI to use their significant FCF yield of \\~20% to seek expansive acquisitions, develop new games in different genres or possibly buyback shares. Over 90% of DDI is owned by insiders and as such creates a shareholder oriented management.  \n\n\nThe lawsuit settlement was an event that was a catalyst for value realization but little to no coverage, illiquidity and current market woes have led to this wildly positive event being overlooked. It is probable that this will be appreciated in the near future especially as earnings return back to normal after being adjusted downward for the settlement charges.\n\n## Comment ID kcoefwu with +1 score by [(Reasonable_Medium_18, Reddit, 2023-12-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContrarianStocks/comments/xkpwho/double_down_interactive_lawsuit_settlement/kcoefwu/) (in reply to ID xkpwho):\nI find it completely unfair that because I couldn't remember the email tied to all my purchases, I only got back the one that has been used minimally.

At the very least, pay your employees better for the amount of work they’re doing, higher the proper amount of staff needed, and stop playing favorites with the overseas studios and hold them accountable for their inability to deliver and collaborate as a team. The growing hostility and lack of respect toward your own employees is resulting in very low morale, not that you would even know.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "Pay is comparatively low for the industry and the city\n\nMobility is no guarantee, the promotion/merit process was a mess and changed multiple times the 3 years I was with Double Down. Company loves to brag about how much money it has in the bank but when its time to give people the proper compensation they deserve, or fully staff teams, suddenly we have to tighten the purse.\n\nThe employee self-review process is unclear and often unfair. Leadership frequently complains that employees give themselves too high of a score and will make up any excuse they can to knock your review down and keep you from moving up in pay grade. \n\nMultiple instances of people getting moved around teams, getting more responsibilities and title changes but with no adjustment to compensation.\n\n‘Soft benefits’ have been cutting back more and more\n\nThe leadership team is a disorganized mess and has no creative vision. They want to branch out into different games since the cash cow casino game is old and so is its player base. However, there is absolutely no proper planning, regular communication, or GTM strategy with the rest of the company. It's like they do everything on the fly at the very last minute, which results in sloppy work being done. When I left, the company was in a ‘throw everything at the wall and see what sticks’ phase, trying to develop several new apps at once yet every team is understaffed in part due to layoffs, but gives managers a hard time acquiring new employees. This had led to multiple failed apps and canceled projects in the last couple of years. \n\nThe Korean offices are a nightmare to work with, horrible with communication, and have absolutely *zero* desire for collaboration. They regularly fail to communicate on time, don’t deliver projects when needed, and then blame us when things don’t go well. Since the company is owned by a Korean firm, leadership has cultivated this culture in which we are effectively not allowed to/unable to communicate and work with them on a consistent basis or hold them accountable which means the US teams struggle to do their job properly but gets most of the blame. The overseas devs will randomly add crappy new features that no one wants into the flagship game and will regularly do so without telling any of us until a week before it goes out to all players and then are shocked when it fails. And yet when the US office wants to make simple, easy improvements to this ancient game so we can stop resting on our laurels and actually compete with modern games we get told they don’t have the time. Leadership plays favorites and always comes to the defense for their incompetence and unrealistic expectations. It’s like management is purposefully setting us up for failure. \n\nThe company’s CMO was so bad to work with that people would complain about working with them on a daily basis. There have been a few instances of people quitting or turning down promotions/title changes because they refuse to report to the CMO. Unrealistic expectations, unattainable goals, hostile attitude, favoritism, etc. \n\nConfusing and increasingly hostile WFH policy has led to very talented and longtime staff departing because managers are not allowed to WFH permanently - but the company keeps hiring fully remote employees. Make up your mind!\n\nEmployees are told to use a sick day or come into the office sick on our in-office day instead of just working remotely, and C-Suite forces managers to take attendance on whos coming in or not like we’re in daycare.",

What do half of the Artists spend their time doing? A quarter of the art team left this year! Evidently they're all partying it up on the 2nd floor and taking 3 hour lunches because ALL WE EVER RELEASE ARE IGT PORTS. I haven't seen anything impressive, innovative, or even remotely ambitious come out of our in-house studio after working here for a full year. I haven't seen any significant improvements to our build stability or test environments, because it's a constant uphill battle. (Props to the guys who care on our dev team though, lord knows their job requires them to be MacGyver, fixing completely BROKEN systems with an oxygen tank and some fishing wire. I think I would go insane.)\r\nI know this is a somewhat emotionally charged review, but everything I say is real and sincere. I'm terribly frustrated to have left my old job for THIS, I feel like DoubleDown promised me the world and lied all the way. They told me they're an amazing start-up where individuals could make a difference. Instead nothing gets shipped and nobody's accountable. The work is frustrating and poorly communicated, all these holes created by key people leaving at inopportune times. I haven't even been here for very long, and I'm already looking for a way out!",

If you HAVE figured it out, tell everyone about it at every opportunity. Then enforce it with peer reviews, manager reviews, and principle-based interviews.\r\n\r\n3: Let people know what their job is, what their goals are, what the company's goals are, then help them succeed. That is at least half of your job and it is the responsibility that nearly every manager at this company ignores.\r\n\r\n3: Stop being afraid. The worst thing they can do is fire you. Acting like the business is not in danger, and that everything is proceeding as expected alienates and demoralizes your people. Admit that things are hard, then talk about how you can fix them.\r\n\r\n4: Don't give up. You still have a solid business despite years of floundering and tough competition. This company is depressing because of all the squandered potential and the toxic culture, but that means you have a lot of simple ways to make things work. DO IT.",

No one really cared about delivering a stunning performance because it would either be ignored, or make others feel like they were being shown up.\r\n\r\n2: We have a lot of money, but most likely not for you. Unless you are in favor, or working for a team that has recently hollowed out, you will be told that promotions are hard and money is tight.\r\n\r\n3:A lot of people are simply not interested in doing a good job. Or any real work at all. These people are rewarded as long as they don't upset anyone. If you show up, deliver your lines -- maybe ad lib something funny but uncontroversial -- you will do well. If you try to do something great, or take risks to attain that greatness you will not do well, young Diva.\r\n\r\n4: It is really hard to eat the free breakfasts or enjoy free massages when the company is disintegrating because of the hubris, insecurities, and ignorance of our culture. When the soul of a narrative dies but the story plods on, what's left is sad and only gets worse the longer it continues. It's just a lot of forced jokes and laugh tracks.\r\n\r\n5: There are some amazing people working there, but they are now leaving as fast as they can find jobs. Most who are left are the kind of people who fail to get other jobs because of \"team fit\" issues. Occasionally someone who looks like a hot-shot on paper may show up to interview (or more often, be taken through a few perfunctory conversations masked as interviews before getting rubber-stamped by an exec), but if we don't actually assess their ability to elevate the team, we have failed the company and the customer.\r\n\r\n6: I have no idea how to be successful, as my job description is completely incompatible with my daily duties. What is my story? My motivation? How do I fit in to the promises we made about who we wanted to be? How does that fit in to the promises we made to our customers? \r\n\r\n7: Without a clear line between action and consequence, nothing has meaning. If I utterly fail to meet a commitment, and there is no consequence, why would I ever bother trying to succeed in the future? Why would anyone ever put in long hours to accomplish goals that are ethereal and shifting, if they are even articulated at all?\r\n\r\n8: We really don't do science, or learn from things, so you feel like you are going insane. Arguments that were settled years ago come back up and everyone acts like they're in undiscovered territory. Problems are not addressed in reasonable and measured ways, they are handled in a way that satisfies the narrative. It is a surreal descent in to madness, and there are often moments where a new employee will look around in disbelief at the unfolding irrationality and drama, possibly thinking they are victims of a long con.",

They may have a line or two, but they are just background; nice and often talented, but not consequential to the plot. \r\n\r\n2: We have a lot of money, so if execs think you are worth it, they will throw it at you. We have been renewed for several seasons beyond our ability to tell a meaningful story to our customers. As long as we are making money you must be doing something right.\r\n\r\n3: If you need to coast, or have a side gig, you will find an excellent work/other work/life balance. No one is really paying attention to your performance, so if you show up a little off, no one will notice.\r\n\r\n4: We are fiddling extra hard while the company burns, so there are still a lot of perks. We attend and sponsor events, and splash money around; even building out a new floor in the building, though we never occupied it. We look really cool while we throw good money after bad, and you'll get to feel special when you attend the events we sponsor in the area. \r\n\r\n5: There are some genuinely amazing people working there. You feel privileged working with actors who are too good for this gig.\r\n\r\n6: I am able to work on pretty much whatever I want. I can ad-lib an architecture, or make a completely unresearched argument for a piece of tech that is nonsensical but sounds cool. If it FEELS right for the show, that is much more important than it actually being a good fit. \r\n\r\n7: There is little to no accountability, so when you make mistakes, it isn't a big deal. No one is really watching you any more, and if they notice, they know you jumped the shark a long time ago. So hey -- you do you.\r\n\r\n8: We really don't do science, or learn from things. Like a bad sitcom, there is a LOT of drama because urgency is sexy. None of it actually matters, and nothing really changes all that often. We just like to promise the same things; thrills, passion, joy, danger, and boundary-pushing action. We haven't delivered, but we still make money. That's what matters.",

Perks are fun and look great on one's Facebook feed, but you can't fix a rotting work culture with arcade games. What do employees want, which DoubleDown does not offer? We want true, tangible benefits like excellent healthcare, above industry-standard pay, and skill training. We want to feel valued and respected, like our time matters. We want to feel that we have growth opportunities at a company that promotes from within. We want to believe in the morals and mission statement of this company - as much as working for a virtual online casino will allow. The problem with Doubledown's much-touted perks, is that they are a distraction from much larger problems which are becoming increasingly hard to ignore. Look, I get it: free massages are hard to pass up, and for a long time, I was starry eyed from all the amazing perks we have here. Now I'm wondering why it takes so darn long for things to improve. I feel discouraged and distracted by how many people have left in such a short time for greener pastures. If this company wants to return to its glory days, things have got to change. And that starts with the organizational culture, growth opportunities, and transparency. Thank you.",

Good luck to the new CTO, there are still some really great engineers there.\r\n\r\nJury's out on the new CEO. Major power-tripper and has forced/enabled some really good people to leave, but maybe potential? if he really listens to the employees and gets his Sr. Management in check, maybe. Maybe fear tactics will work in his benefit, I think he has good intentions, but then again, I'm not there anymore. I think he was fired from Amazon after 2 years, not sure why.\r\n\r\nThey have no business model other than Facebook. What if Facebook decides to drop all Gambling apps?

It does not give us a reason for existing 2 years from now, or a reason to feel good about coming to work every day.  Remember that \"Make a lot of money and have a lot of players and paying players\" are not a strategic vision.  We want that too! But those things aren't inherently motivating in their own right.  \r\n\r\nPut your people first -- Always.  Solving a short term problem isn't productive, no matter what the technology, if you're not building a team and a culture where people can be given opportunities to succeed, and to take controlled risks.  The well being of your subordinates and teams should be your top priority; success in every other area will follow naturally.",

Managers always seem to prefer to hire someone from outside the company instead of looking at the resources they already have on hand. Some managers seem to actively resist internal promotions in favor of external hires.  This is demoralizing to teams and individual contributors, and is actively destructive outside of team dynamics because of the tech debt that's always introduced by trying to solve our old problems of complexity by adding layers to them.\r\n\r\nOur review processes are arbitrary and seem to have no bearing on reality of employee performance or daily conversations with managers. Ratings are a surprise, feedback does not correlate well with the ratings, and ratings feel like they're set outside of the manager/subordinate relationship -- it's as if the ratings come from some quota set from above, and then the manager fills in the blanks on the review to match the magic number. \r\n\r\nOur senior Engineering and Product leadership seem more focused on their own short term agendas and political maneuvering than they are on trying to establish any common objectives for the company.  This trickles down to the rest of their organizations -- Product is disassociated with reality,  and much of our Engineering leadership seems more interested in resume building than in actually solving problems we face as a company.  \r\n\r\nWe lack any common vision or strategic goals. If they exist, they are not well communicated down the chain, and management doesn't work to keep teams focused on any common vision -- every manager has their own agenda, and will gladly play blame games and fight with each other if their agenda favors it. \r\n\r\nVery few leaders within the company care about team building or improving team dynamics; those who do are disincentiveized because there's always someone who's willing to cut corners or push problems on to other teams or individuals so that they can deliver something of any quality as quickly as possible  -- and all anyone cares about is the short term.  Leaders and individual contributors who show initiative to try and improve broken systems or tools are disincentiveized for the same reason -- trying to improve broken things or buck the status quo in any way whatsoever is bad for your career at DoubleDown, because the immediate deliverable of the next two weeks is all that matters to Managers.  \r\n\r\nIn Engineering we're Agile in Name Only -- as described above, Management will gleefully demand short term deliverables and minimum viable product ... but, since we lack any long term goal or unifying vision, ANY deliverable seems as valid as another, as long as you can do it quickly and push problems away from yourself.",

DoubleDown has a severe disconnect between Executive leadership and the contributor level -- Consider mitigating this with honest, objective 360 reviews. \r\n\r\nRemember that a technology or specific product is NOT a vision.  It does not give us a reason for existing 2 years from now, or a reason to feel good about coming to work every day.  Remember that \"Make a lot of money and have a lot of players and paying players\" are not a strategic vision.  We want that too! But those things aren't inherently motivating in their own right.  \r\n\r\nPut your people first -- Always.  Solving a short term problem isn't productive, no matter what the technology, if you're not building a team and a culture where people can be given opportunities to succeed, and to take controlled risks.  The well being of your subordinates and teams should be your top priority; success in every other area will follow naturally.",

Managers always seem to prefer to hire someone from outside the company instead of looking at the resources they already have on hand. Some managers seem to actively resist internal promotions in favor of external hires.  This is demoralizing to teams and individual contributors, and is actively destructive outside of team dynamics because of the tech debt that's always introduced by trying to solve our old problems of complexity by adding layers to them.\r\n\r\nOur review processes are arbitrary and seem to have no bearing on reality of employee performance or daily conversations with managers. Ratings are a surprise, feedback does not correlate well with the ratings, and ratings feel like they're set outside of the manager/subordinate relationship -- it's as if the ratings come from some quota set from above, and then the manager fills in the blanks on the review to match the magic number. \r\n\r\nOur senior Engineering and Product leadership seem more focused on their own short term agendas and political maneuvering than they are on trying to establish any common objectives for the company.  This trickles down to the rest of their organizations -- Product is disassociated with reality,  and much of our Engineering leadership seems more interested in resume building than in actually solving problems we face as a company.  \r\n\r\nWe lack any common vision or strategic goals. If they exist, they are not well communicated down the chain, and management doesn't work to keep teams focused on any common vision -- every manager has their own agenda, and will gladly play blame games and fight with each other if their agenda favors it. \r\n\r\nVery few leaders within the company care about team building or improving team dynamics; those who do are disincentiveized because there's always someone who's willing to cut corners or push problems on to other teams or individuals so that they can deliver something of any quality as quickly as possible  -- and all anyone cares about is the short term.  Leaders and individual contributors who show initiative to try and improve broken systems or tools are disincentiveized for the same reason -- trying to improve broken things or buck the status quo in any way whatsoever is bad for your career at DoubleDown, because the immediate deliverable of the next two weeks is all that matters to Managers.  \r\n\r\nIn Engineering we're Agile in Name Only -- as described above, Management will gleefully demand short term deliverables and minimum viable product ... but, since we lack any long term goal or unifying vision, ANY deliverable seems as valid as another, as long as you can do it quickly and push problems away from yourself.",

I find myself wondering things like.... What do most of the Producers and Designers even DO? Our games don't require any innovation, and I don't see any plans to change that. What do half of the Artists spend their time doing? A quarter of the art team left this year! Evidently they're all partying it up on the 2nd floor and taking 3 hour lunches because ALL WE EVER RELEASE ARE IGT PORTS. I haven't seen anything impressive, innovative, or even remotely ambitious come out of our in-house studio after working here for a full year. I haven't seen any significant improvements to our build stability or test environments, because it's a constant uphill battle. (Props to the guys who care on our dev team though, lord knows their job requires them to be MacGyver, fixing completely BROKEN systems with an oxygen tank and some fishing wire. I think I would go insane.)\r\nI know this is a somewhat emotionally charged review, but everything I say is real and sincere. I'm terribly frustrated to have left my old job for THIS, I feel like DoubleDown promised me the world and lied all the way. They told me they're an amazing start-up where individuals could make a difference. Instead nothing gets shipped and nobody's accountable.

We want to feel that we have growth opportunities at a company that promotes from within. We want to believe in the morals and mission statement of this company - as much as working for a virtual online casino will allow. The problem with Doubledown's much-touted perks, is that they are a distraction from much larger problems which are becoming increasingly hard to ignore. Look, I get it: free massages are hard to pass up, and for a long time, I was starry eyed from all the amazing perks we have here. Now I'm wondering why it takes so darn long for things to improve.

That is at least half of your job and it is the responsibility that nearly every manager at this company ignores.\r\n\r\n3: Stop being afraid. The worst thing they can do is fire you. Acting like the business is not in danger, and that everything is proceeding as expected alienates and demoralizes your people. Admit that things are hard, then talk about how you can fix them.\r\n\r\n4: Don't give up. You still have a solid business despite years of floundering and tough competition.

Unless you are in favor, or working for a team that has recently hollowed out, you will be told that promotions are hard and money is tight.\r\n\r\n3:A lot of people are simply not interested in doing a good job. Or any real work at all. These people are rewarded as long as they don't upset anyone. If you show up, deliver your lines -- maybe ad lib something funny but uncontroversial -- you will do well. If you try to do something great, or take risks to attain that greatness you will not do well, young Diva.\r\n\r\n4: It is really hard to eat the free breakfasts or enjoy free massages when the company is disintegrating because of the hubris, insecurities, and ignorance of our culture. When the soul of a narrative dies but the story plods on, what's left is sad and only gets worse the longer it continues. It's just a lot of forced jokes and laugh tracks.\r\n\r\n5: There are some amazing people working there, but they are now leaving as fast as they can find jobs. Most who are left are the kind of people who fail to get other jobs because of \"team fit\" issues. Occasionally someone who looks like a hot-shot on paper may show up to interview (or more often, be taken through a few perfunctory conversations masked as interviews before getting rubber-stamped by an exec), but if we don't actually assess their ability to elevate the team, we have failed the company and the customer.\r\n\r\n6: I have no idea how to be successful, as my job description is completely incompatible with my daily duties. What is my story? My motivation? How do I fit in to the promises we made about who we wanted to be? How does that fit in to the promises we made to our customers? \r\n\r\n7: Without a clear line between action and consequence, nothing has meaning. If I utterly fail to meet a commitment, and there is no consequence, why would I ever bother trying to succeed in the future? Why would anyone ever put in long hours to accomplish goals that are ethereal and shifting, if they are even articulated at all?\r\n\r\n8: We really don't do science, or learn from things, so you feel like you are going insane. Arguments that were settled years ago come back up and everyone acts like they're in undiscovered territory. Problems are not addressed in reasonable and measured ways, they are handled in a way that satisfies the narrative.

We have been renewed for several seasons beyond our ability to tell a meaningful story to our customers. As long as we are making money you must be doing something right.\r\n\r\n3: If you need to coast, or have a side gig, you will find an excellent work/other work/life balance. No one is really paying attention to your performance, so if you show up a little off, no one will notice.\r\n\r\n4: We are fiddling extra hard while the company burns, so there are still a lot of perks. We attend and sponsor events, and splash money around; even building out a new floor in the building, though we never occupied it. We look really cool while we throw good money after bad, and you'll get to feel special when you attend the events we sponsor in the area. \r\n\r\n5: There are some genuinely amazing people working there. You feel privileged working with actors who are too good for this gig.\r\n\r\n6: I am able to work on pretty much whatever I want. I can ad-lib an architecture, or make a completely unresearched argument for a piece of tech that is nonsensical but sounds cool. If it FEELS right for the show, that is much more important than it actually being a good fit. \r\n\r\n7: There is little to no accountability, so when you make mistakes, it isn't a big deal. No one is really watching you any more, and if they notice, they know you jumped the shark a long time ago. So hey -- you do you.\r\n\r\n8: We really don't do science, or learn from things. Like a bad sitcom, there is a LOT of drama because urgency is sexy. None of it actually matters, and nothing really changes all that often.

The growing hostility and lack of respect toward your own employees is resulting in very low morale, not that you would even know.",
        "cons": "Pay is comparatively low for the industry and the city\n\nMobility is no guarantee, the promotion/merit process was a mess and changed multiple times the 3 years I was with Double Down. Company loves to brag about how much money it has in the bank but when its time to give people the proper compensation they deserve, or fully staff teams, suddenly we have to tighten the purse.\n\nThe employee self-review process is unclear and often unfair. Leadership frequently complains that employees give themselves too high of a score and will make up any excuse they can to knock your review down and keep you from moving up in pay grade. \n\nMultiple instances of people getting moved around teams, getting more responsibilities and title changes but with no adjustment to compensation.\n\n‘Soft benefits’ have been cutting back more and more\n\nThe leadership team is a disorganized mess and has no creative vision. They want to branch out into different games since the cash cow casino game is old and so is its player base. However, there is absolutely no proper planning, regular communication, or GTM strategy with the rest of the company. It's like they do everything on the fly at the very last minute, which results in sloppy work being done. When I left, the company was in a ‘throw everything at the wall and see what sticks’ phase, trying to develop several new apps at once yet every team is understaffed in part due to layoffs, but gives managers a hard time acquiring new employees. This had led to multiple failed apps and canceled projects in the last couple of years. \n\nThe Korean offices are a nightmare to work with, horrible with communication, and have absolutely *zero* desire for collaboration. They regularly fail to communicate on time, don’t deliver projects when needed, and then blame us when things don’t go well. Since the company is owned by a Korean firm, leadership has cultivated this culture in which we are effectively not allowed to/unable to communicate and work with them on a consistent basis or hold them accountable which means the US teams struggle to do their job properly but gets most of the blame. The overseas devs will randomly add crappy new features that no one wants into the flagship game and will regularly do so without telling any of us until a week before it goes out to all players and then are shocked when it fails. And yet when the US office wants to make simple, easy improvements to this ancient game so we can stop resting on our laurels and actually compete with modern games we get told they don’t have the time. Leadership plays favorites and always comes to the defense for their incompetence and unrealistic expectations. It’s like management is purposefully setting us up for failure. \n\nThe company’s CMO was so bad to work with that people would complain about working with them on a daily basis. There have been a few instances of people quitting or turning down promotions/title changes because they refuse to report to the CMO. Unrealistic expectations, unattainable goals, hostile attitude, favoritism, etc. \n\nConfusing and increasingly hostile WFH policy has led to very talented and longtime staff departing because managers are not allowed to WFH permanently - but the company keeps hiring fully remote employees. Make up your mind!\n\nEmployees are told to use a sick day or come into the office sick on our in-office day instead of just working remotely, and C-Suite forces managers to take attendance on whos coming in or not like we’re in daycare.",

(NASDAQ: DDI) (“DoubleDown” or the “Company”), a leading developer and publisher of digital games on mobile and web-based platforms, today announced unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 vs. Second Quarter 2023 Summary:\n\nRevenue increased to $88.2 million in the second quarter of 2024 from $75.2 million in the second quarter of 2023. SuprNation, a European iGaming operator (“SuprNation”) which was acquired by the Company on October 31, 2023, generated total revenue of $7.9 million in the second quarter of 2024. Revenue exclusive of the contributions from SuprNation increased 7% to $80.3 million.\n\nOperating expenses increased to $52.0 million in the second quarter of 2024 from $47.7 million in the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to the second quarter 2024 inclusion of operating expenses related to SuprNation, partially offset by lower sales and marketing and research and development expenses.\n\nNet income increased to $33.3 million, or earnings per fully diluted common share of $13.39 ($0.67 per American Depositary Share (“ADS”)), in the second quarter of 2024, from net income of $24.4 million, or earnings per fully diluted common share of $9.83 ($0.49 per ADS), in the second quarter of 2023. Such increase was primarily due to higher revenue and lower overall sales and marketing and research and development expenses, partially offset by higher general and administrative expense which included new expenses for SuprNation. Each ADS represents 0.05 share of a common share.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased to $37.0 million for the second quarter of 2024 from $27.6 million in the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 41.9% in the second quarter of 2024 from 36.7% in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nAverage Revenue Per Daily Active User (“ARPDAU”) for the Company’s social casino/free-to-play games increased to $1.33 in the second quarter of 2024 from $1.05 in the second quarter of 2023 and from $1.26 in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nAverage monthly revenue per payer for the social casino/free-to-play games increased to $288 in the second quarter of 2024 from $235 in the second quarter of 2023 and from $281 in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n“We continued to drive strong growth across our business in the 2024 second quarter, with consolidated revenue rising 17% to $88.2 million and adjusted EBITDA increasing 34% to $37.0 million,” said In Keuk Kim, Chief Executive Officer of DoubleDown. “Revenue for our social casino business rose 7% compared to the same period in 2023, the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, as we believe we continue to gain industry share. The recent introduction of new meta features in our flagship app, DoubleDown Casino, continues to help drive strong improvements in player engagement and monetization, as evidenced by ARPDAU and average revenue per payer rising year over year by 27% and 23%, respectively. Impressively, these metrics were both up on a quarterly sequential basis despite the historical seasonality in our business.\n\n“Our SuprNation iGaming operations also had another solid quarter as 2024 second quarter revenue of $7.9 million was well above the estimated quarterly run rate the business was generating prior to our acquisition. We continue to fine-tune our go-to-market strategies for growing SuprNation’s topline while remaining focused on ensuring our near-term marketing and player engagement strategies will result in sustainable mid- and long-term profitable revenue and cash flow contributions.\n\n“Our disciplined approach to user acquisition and R&D spend delivers strong quarterly Adjusted EBITDA margins and free cash flow. As a result, we continue to improve our already strong financial position as we ended the second quarter with an aggregate net cash position of approximately $303 million, or approximately $6.12 per ADS. Going forward, our focus will remain on prudently driving further increases in player monetization to deliver consistent free cash flow generation while simultaneously evaluating both organic and M&A focused growth opportunities to leverage our significant financial strength in order to further grow our top and bottom lines and create new value for our shareholders.”\n\nSummary Operating Results for DoubleDown Interactive (Unaudited)Three months ended June 30,Six months ended June 30,2024202320242023Revenue ($ MM)$88.2$75.2$176.4$152.8Total operating expenses52.047.7109.199.9Net income ($ MM)$33.3$24.4$63.6$48.0Adjusted EBITDA ($ MM)$37.0$27.6$68.9$53.0Net income margin37.7%32.4%36.1%31.4%Adjusted EBITDA margin41.9%36.7%39.1%34.7%Non-financial performance metricsAverage MAUs (000s)1,3891,8041,4331,918Average DAUs (000s)664793681817ARPDAU$1.33$1.05$1.29$1.04Average monthly revenue per payer$288$235$285$228Payer conversion6.7%6.0%6.5%5.9%\n\n(1) Social casino/free-to-play games only\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nRevenue inclusive of the contributions from SuprNation in the second quarter of 2024 was $88.2 million, an increase of 17% from $75.2 million in the second quarter of 2023. Revenue exclusive of the contributions from SuprNation increased 7% year over year to $80.3 million, primarily reflecting higher engagement and monetization of the existing player base.\n\nOperating expenses in the second quarter of 2024 increased 9% year over year to $52.0 million. The increase is primarily due to the inclusion of SuprNation expenses in the second quarter of 2024, which were not incurred in the second quarter of 2023 given that SuprNation was acquired in October 2023.\n\nNet income increased to $33.3 million in the second quarter of 2024, or $13.39 per fully diluted common share ($0.67 per ADS), from net income of $24.4 million, or $9.83 per fully diluted common share ($0.49 per ADS), in the second quarter of 2023. The increase in net income was primarily due to increased revenue and lower sales and marketing and research and development expenditures, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses which included the new expenses for SuprNation. Each ADS represents 0.05 share of a common share.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2024 increased 34%, or $9.4 million, to $37.0 million, compared to $27.6 million in the second quarter of 2023. Consistent with the increase in net income, the improvement in EBITDA primarily reflects higher revenue and lower sales and marketing and research and development expenses, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses which included the new expenses for SuprNation.\n\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for the second quarter of 2024 was $34.4 million, compared to net cash flows used in operating activities of $37.6 million in the second quarter of 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher net income and a lower deferred tax asset impact, as well as the final payment of $95.25 million towards the Benson litigation settlement that occurred in 2023.\n\nConference Call\n\nDoubleDown will hold a conference call today (August 12, 2024) at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss these results. A question-and-answer session will follow management’s presentation.\n\nTo access the call, please use the following link: DoubleDown Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. After registering, an email will be sent, including dial-in details and a unique conference call access code required to join the live call.

The Company’s flagship social casino title, DoubleDown Casino, has been a fan-favorite game on leading social and mobile platforms for years, entertaining millions of players worldwide with a lineup of classic and modern games. Following its acquisition of SuprNation in October 2023, the Company also operates three real-money iGaming sites in Western Europe.\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nCertain statements contained in this press release are “forward-looking statements” about future events and expectations for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions, and expectations of industry trends, our future financial and operating performance, and our growth plans, taking into account the information currently available to us. These statements are not statements of historical fact. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on such statements. Words such as “anticipates,” believes,” “continues,” “estimates,” “expects,” “goal,” “objectives,” “intends,” “may,” “opportunity,” “plans,” potential,” “near-term,” long-term,” “projections,” “assumptions,” “projects,” “guidance,” “forecasts,” “outlook,” “target,” “trends,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “will,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. We qualify any forward-looking statements entirely by these cautionary factors. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements for any reason or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.\n\nUse and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), we believe the following non-GAAP financial measure is useful in evaluating our operating performance. We present “adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization” (“Adjusted EBITDA”) because we believe it assists investors and analysts by facilitating comparison of period-to-period operational performance on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. The items excluded from the Adjusted EBITDA may have a material impact on our financial results. Certain of those items are non-recurring, while others are non-cash in nature. Accordingly, the Adjusted EBITDA is presented as supplemental disclosure and should not be considered in isolation of, as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements furnished in our report on Form 6-K filed with the SEC.\n\nIn our reconciliation from our reported GAAP “net income before provision for taxes” to our Adjusted EBITDA, we eliminate the impact of the following six line items: (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) interest income; (iii) interest expense; (iv) foreign currency transaction/remeasurement (gain) loss; (v) short-term investments (gain) loss; and (vi) other (income) expense, net. The below table sets forth the full reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures:\n\nReconciliation of non-GAAP measuresThree months ended June 30,Six months ended June 30,(in millions, except percentages)2024202320242023Net income (loss)$33.3$24.4$63.6$48.0Income tax expense (benefit)9.47.617.414.3Income (loss) before tax42.631.981.062.3Adjustments for:Depreciation and amortization0.8-1.60.1Interest income(3.8)(4.2)(7.3)(7.4)Interest expense0.40.40.80.9Foreign currency transaction/remeasurement (gain) loss(2.9)(0.7)(7.2)(3.1)Short-term investments (gain) loss-0.1-0.1Other (income) expense, net(0.2)-(0.2)0.1Adjusted EBITDA$37.0$27.6$68.9$53.0Adjusted EBITDA margin41.9%36.7%39.1%34.7%\n\nWe encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\n\nCompany Contact:\n\nJoe Sigrist\n\nir@doubledown.com\n\n+1 (206) 773-2266\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nhttps://www.doubledowninteractive.com\n\nInvestor Relations Contact:\n\nJoseph Jaffoni or Richard Land\n\nJCIR\n\n+1 (212) 835-8500\n\nDDI@jcir.com\n\nDoubleDown Interactive Co., Ltd.\n\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts)June 30,December 31,20242023Assets(unaudited)\n\nCurrent assets:Cash and cash equivalents$269,155$206,911Short-term investments70,00067,756Accounts receivable, net34,00032,517Prepaid expenses, and other assets7,7748,570Total current assets$380,929$315,754Property and equipment, net347444Operating lease right-of-use assets, net6,6607,130Intangible assets, net49,55951,571Goodwill396,236396,704Deferred tax asset17,43228,934Other non-current assets1,4792,807Total assets$852,642$803,344Liabilities and Shareholders’ EquityAccounts payable and accrued expenses(1)$13,249$13,293Short-term operating lease liabilities(2)1,3623,157Income taxes payable2,532112Contract liabilities1,7772,520Current portion of borrowing with related party(3)-38,778Other current liabilities(4)1,47410,645Total current liabilities$20,394$68,505Long-term borrowings with related party(5)35,992-Long-term operating lease liabilities(6)5,4724,420Deferred tax liabilities, net543848Other non-current liabilities(7)3,9321,681Total liabilities$66,333$75,454Shareholders’ equityCommon stock, KRW 10,000 par value - 200,000,000 Shares authorized; 2,477,672, issued and outstanding21,19821,198Additional paid-in-capital359,280359,280Accumulated other comprehensive income14,98619,982Retained earnings390,758327,273Total shareholders’ equity attributable to shareowners of DDI Co.

      "# [DoubleDown Interactive (NASDAQ:DDI) Is Looking To Continue Growing Its Returns On Capital](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/33620505/doubledown-interactive-nasdaq-ddi-is-looking-to-continue-growing-its)\nWhat trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in DoubleDown Interactive's (NASDAQ:DDI) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on DoubleDown Interactive is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.15 = US$107m ÷ (US$761m - US$53m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).\n\nSo, DoubleDown Interactive has an ROCE of 15%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 8.4% generated by the Entertainment industry.\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for DoubleDown Interactive compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for DoubleDown Interactive.\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For DoubleDown Interactive Tell Us?\n\nDoubleDown Interactive's ROCE growth is quite impressive. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last three years, the ROCE has climbed 35% in that same time. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nAs discussed above, DoubleDown Interactive appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. Since the stock has returned a solid 8.5% to shareholders over the last year, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.\n\nOn the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation. That's why we have a FREE intrinsic value estimation on our platform that is definitely worth checking out.\n\nWhile DoubleDown Interactive isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.",
      "# [DoubleDown Interactive Completes Acquisition of SuprNation by Niji Narayan, Peter Tolan on 2023-11-02](https://europeangaming.eu/portal/latest-news/2023/11/02/146448/doubledown-interactive-completes-acquisition-of-suprnation/)\nReading Time: 2 minutes\n\nDoubleDown Interactive, a leading developer and publisher of digital games on mobile and web-based platforms, announced the completion of its previously announced acquisition of iGaming operator, SuprNation, for total cash consideration of approximately $36.5 million (€34.3 million). The acquisition diversifies the digital games categories that DoubleDown addresses with the addition of three real-money iGaming sites in Western Europe. Following the closing, Mr. In Keuk Kim, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, will be appointed as the Chairman of SuprNation.\n\nSuprNation is a technology company founded in 2015 to serve as a home for creative people in the iGaming industry. Its first product was launched in the summer of 2016, a casino intended to deliver a better user and gaming experience than what was previously available. SuprNation owns the VoodooDreams, NYSpinz and Duelz brands, and is licensed in Malta, Sweden, the Isle of Man and Great Britain.\n\n“The acquisition of SuprNation is an important step in establishing our presence in new high-growth gaming categories that are complementary to our core social casino operations where we can leverage our game developers’ expertise in game creation and our marketing platform to scale the business profitably. SuprNation has a strong and loyal player base in several European markets such as Sweden and the UK, and we expect to add more regulated jurisdictions over time. We are confident in our ability to leverage our broad portfolio of casino game content and development expertise to further expand SuprNation’s differentiated online casino gaming experiences, such as their flagship title, Duelz.com, to drive growth in the business,” In Keuk Kim said.\n\n“In addition, to anticipated revenue growth opportunities which will benefit from both DoubleDown’s and SuprNation’s significant player engagement and monetization expertise, we expect to realize synergies in our player acquisition activities as well as other costs such as marketing, back office in-sourcing and potential native Apple/Android app development. We are delighted to welcome the SuprNation team members to DoubleDown and look forward to working collaboratively on our initiatives to drive growth across the business,” In Keuk Kim added.\n\n“In combining DoubleDown’s and SuprNation’s strengths in game development and player engagement and monetization, we are excited about the prospects of accelerating the growth of SuprNation’s real-money iGaming operations. We look forward to working with In Keuk Kim and the entire DoubleDown team to further unlock SuprNation’s growth potential,” Joakim Stockman and Henric Andersson, Co-Chief Executive Officers of SuprNation, said.\n\nRelated\n\nReading Time: 2 minutes\n\nFavourite lottery style game is updated for mobile first play with significant bonuses.\n\nDrop into the exhilarating world of Keno Bonus Number from TaDa Gaming and experience high octane thrills.

From October 8th to 10th, visitors to booth 2848 will have the opportunity to participate in a Keepy-Uppy Challenge, designed to give back to communities in need while promoting the spirit of solidarity.\n\nThe initiative invites attendees to show off their soccer skills in a simple but meaningful way: for every successful keepy-uppy (juggle) a participant completes on the newest Ronaldinho Crash game, the FBM Foundation will donate $1 to support vulnerable communities around the world. These donations are going to be made to individuals affected by natural disasters, children in need of educational resources, and other vulnerable groups.\n\nThis is FBM Foundation’s first ever participation at an international casino gaming trade-show and the choice of G2E Las Vegas to make its debut was not random. Choosing a stage like the Global Gaming Expo was the right move to showcase the Group’s will to make a difference in the world, sharing its solidarity footprint with a broader, diverse audience of casino gaming enthusiasts, casino operators, players and industry professionals.\n\n“We believe in the power of coming together for a greater purpose,” says Renato Almeida, Director of FBM®️ Group. “This initiative not only highlights the team-building spirit that defines FBMDS, but it also allows us to showcase the work of the FBM Foundation and our commitment to making a positive impact on the world with the help of G2E Las Vegas.”\n\nFBM Foundation has long been dedicated to supporting causes that promote education, community development, and relief efforts for those impacted by crises in the Philippines, Brazil and beyond. “Through this keepy-uppy challenge, FBMDS and FBM Foundation aim to inspire action and demonstrate how collective efforts—whether on the field or off—can make a real difference in the lives of those who need it most”, shares FBM Foundation’s representative, Vítor Francisco.\n\nThe Ronaldinho Crash game is one of FBMDS’ latest product releases, featuring the global football legend Ronaldinho Gaúcho on a thrilling keepy-uppy crash gaming experience. The game, which was officially launched during the American Cup and will be available to try at the fair, is already winning over crowds in multiple countries around the globe.\n\nIn addition to Ronaldinho Crash, visitors to G2E Las Vegas 2024 will be able to experience for the first time the new Infinity Series video bingo line and the new Sapphire Fever bingo, the new Safe Blaster slot game, as well as the popular Champion Tales crash game, the famous Top+Plus table games collection and much more.\n\nAttendees at G2E Las Vegas 2024 are encouraged to stop by booth 2848, take part in the challenge, and help support the initiative between FBMDS and FBM Foundation. Whether you’re an expert juggler or simply want to get involved, every attempt counts towards the greater goal of raising funds for global causes.\n\nRelated",
      "# [What DoubleDown Interactive Co., Ltd.'s (NASDAQ:DDI) 46% Share Price Gain Is Not Telling You](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/33917058/what-doubledown-interactive-co-ltd-s-nasdaq-ddi-46-share)\nDoubleDown Interactive Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ:DDI) shares have continued their recent momentum with a 46% gain in the last month alone. Looking back a bit further, it's encouraging to see the stock is up 40% in the last year.\n\nAfter such a large jump in price, you could be forgiven for thinking DoubleDown Interactive is a stock not worth researching with a price-to-sales ratios (or \"P/S\") of 2.1x, considering almost half the companies in the United States' Entertainment industry have P/S ratios below 1.1x. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/S at face value as there may be an explanation why it's as high as it is.\n\nWhat Does DoubleDown Interactive's P/S Mean For Shareholders?\n\nDoubleDown Interactive hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining revenue compares poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth in their revenues on average. It might be that many expect the dour revenue performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/S from collapsing. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price.\n\nKeen to find out how analysts think DoubleDown Interactive's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.\n\nIs There Enough Revenue Growth Forecasted For DoubleDown Interactive?\n\nDoubleDown Interactive's P/S ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver solid growth, and importantly, perform better than the industry.\n\nTaking a look back first, the company's revenue growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 6.2%. As a result, revenue from three years ago have also fallen 21% overall. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing revenue over that time.\n\nTurning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 2.6% each year as estimated by the three analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the industry is forecast to expand by 9.9% per annum, which is noticeably more attractive.\n\nWith this in consideration, we believe it doesn't make sense that DoubleDown Interactive's P/S is outpacing its industry peers. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/S falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nDoubleDown Interactive shares have taken a big step in a northerly direction, but its P/S is elevated as a result. Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-sales ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.\n\nIt comes as a surprise to see DoubleDown Interactive trade at such a high P/S given the revenue forecasts look less than stellar. Right now we aren't comfortable with the high P/S as the predicted future revenues aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.\n\nThe company's balance sheet is another key area for risk analysis. You can assess many of the main risks through our free balance sheet analysis for DoubleDown Interactive with six simple checks.\n\nIf you're unsure about the strength of DoubleDown Interactive's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.",
      "# [SuprNation contributes $8.3m in DoubleDown Q1 revenue](https://www.intergameonline.com/igaming/news/suprnation-contributes-83m-in-doubledown-q1-revenue)\nDoubleDown Interactive has revealed that its newly acquired igaming operator business SuprNation contributed revenue of US$8.3m in Q1 this year.\n\nOverall company revenue increased from $77.6m in Q1 last year to $88.1m, a 14 per cent rise year-on-year.\n\nRevenue exclusive of SuprNation, which DoubleDown acquired in October, rose by three per cent to $79.8m.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by 26 per cent from $25.4m in Q1 2023 to $31.9m in the latest reporting period, “primarily due to higher revenue and lower overall sales and marketing and research and development expenses, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses.”\n\nIndeed, DoubleDown said its operating expenses rose by $4.9m to $57.1m, due to the inclusion of expenses related to SuprNation operations in Q1.\n\nDoubleDown CEO Keuk Kim said SuprNation is “off to a strong start” and said the company intends to “focus on driving revenue growth” for the operator “for the next several quarters.”\n\nAverage revenue per daily active user (ARPDAU) for the company’s social casino/free-to-play games increased to $1.26 in Q1 from $1.03 in Q1 2023 and from $1.24 in Q4 2023. Average monthly revenue in the segment rose to $281 from $221 in Q1 2023 and $279 in Q4 2023.\n\n“Our DoubleDown Casino’s performance is benefitting from the recently introduced meta features that are further advancing our ability to improve monetisation and generate strong engagement metrics, with ARPDAU rising on a quarterly sequential basis and by 22 per cent year over year, and average revenue per payer also rising from 2023 fourth quarter levels and growing 27 per cent year over year,” Kim said.\n\n“The strong performance of our social casino business combined with our commitment to remain disciplined with user acquisition and R&D spend delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow, with cash flow from operating activities of $34.9m in the 2024 first quarter.”"

    "# Comprehensive Report on DoubleDown Interactive\n\n## Company Overview\nDoubleDown Interactive Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ: DDI) is a prominent developer and publisher of digital games, primarily focusing on mobile and web-based platforms. The company is known for its flagship product, **DoubleDown Casino**, which offers a social casino experience that brings authentic Vegas entertainment to players globally. Founded in 2008 and headquartered in Seoul, South Korea, DoubleDown operates as a subsidiary of DoubleU Games Co., Ltd. The company underwent a name change from The8Games Co., Ltd. in December 2019 [(GlobeNewswire, 2024)](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/10/10/2961471/0/en/DoubleDown-Interactive-to-Report-2024-Third-Quarter-Results-on-November-11-and-Host-Conference-Call-and-Webcast.html).\n\n## Recent Financial Performance\nIn the second quarter of 2024, DoubleDown reported a revenue increase to **$88.2 million**, up from **$75.2 million** in the same quarter of 2023, marking a **17% year-over-year growth**. This growth was bolstered by the acquisition of **SuprNation**, a European iGaming operator, which contributed **$7.9 million** to the revenue in Q2 2024 [(DoubleDown Interactive, 2024)](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/DDI/double-down-interactive-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-xrwgkde6fur7.html). Excluding SuprNation, revenue still grew by **7%** to **$80.3 million**. The company's net income also saw a significant rise, reaching **$33.3 million** compared to **$24.4 million** in Q2 2023 [(DoubleDown Interactive, 2024)](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/DDI/double-down-interactive-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-xrwgkde6fur7.html).\n\n### Key Financial Metrics\n- **Adjusted EBITDA**: Increased to **$37.0 million** from **$27.6 million** year-over-year, reflecting a **34% increase** [(DoubleDown Interactive, 2024)](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/DDI/double-down-interactive-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-xrwgkde6fur7.html).\n- **Average Revenue Per Daily Active User (ARPDAU)**: Rose to **$1.33**, up from **$1.05** in Q2 2023 [(DoubleDown Interactive, 2024)](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/DDI/double-down-interactive-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-xrwgkde6fur7.html).\n- **Average Monthly Revenue Per Payer**: Increased to **$288**, compared to **$235** in the same quarter last year [(DoubleDown Interactive, 2024)](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/DDI/double-down-interactive-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-xrwgkde6fur7.html).\n\n## Acquisition of SuprNation\nDoubleDown completed the acquisition of SuprNation on **October 31, 2023**, for approximately **$36.5 million**. This strategic move allows DoubleDown to diversify its offerings by entering the real-money iGaming market, operating three sites in Western Europe. CEO In Keuk Kim emphasized the potential for leveraging DoubleDown's game development expertise to enhance SuprNation's operations and drive growth in this new segment [(Niji Narayan, European Gaming, 2023)](https://europeangaming.eu/portal/latest-news/2023/11/02/146448/doubledown-interactive-completes-acquisition-of-suprnation/).\n\n## Executive Insights\nIn Keuk Kim, the CEO of DoubleDown, stated, “We continued to drive strong growth across our business in the 2024 second quarter... The recent introduction of new meta features in our flagship app, DoubleDown Casino, continues to help drive strong improvements in player engagement and monetization” [(DoubleDown Interactive, 2024)](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/DDI/double-down-interactive-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-xrwgkde6fur7.html). This highlights the company's focus on enhancing user experience and engagement through innovative features.\n\n## Market Position and Future Outlook\nDoubleDown's stock has shown resilience, with a **46% gain** in share price over the past month, reflecting positive investor sentiment despite some concerns regarding revenue growth forecasts. Analysts predict a modest growth rate of **2.6% annually** over the next three years, which is below the industry average of **9.9%** [(Moomoo, 2024)](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/33917058/what-doubledown-interactive-co-ltd-s-nasdaq-ddi-46-share). The company's price-to-sales ratio stands at **2.1x**, which is considered high given the current revenue growth outlook, indicating potential risks for investors [(Moomoo, 2024)](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/33917058/what-doubledown-interactive-co-ltd-s-nasdaq-ddi-46-share).\n\n## Product Development\nDoubleDown Casino remains the cornerstone of the company's product lineup, consistently attracting millions of players with its diverse range of games. The introduction of new features has reportedly improved player engagement metrics significantly, with ARPDAU and average revenue per payer both showing substantial year-over-year increases [(DoubleDown Interactive, 2024)](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/DDI/double-down-interactive-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-xrwgkde6fur7.html).\n\n## Conclusion\nDoubleDown Interactive is positioned as a strong player in the digital gaming industry, with recent financial results indicating robust growth and strategic expansion through acquisitions. However, potential investors should consider the company's revenue growth forecasts and market valuation carefully. The management's focus on enhancing user engagement and exploring new growth avenues through acquisitions like SuprNation could provide a pathway for sustained success in the competitive gaming landscape.\n\nFor further details, prospective candidates and investors are encouraged to review the company's financial reports and participate in upcoming earnings calls, such as the one scheduled for **November 11, 2024** [(GlobeNewswire, 2024)](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/10/10/2961471/0/en/DoubleDown-Interactive-to-Report-2024-Third-Quarter-Results-on-November-11-and-Host-Conference-Call-and-Webcast.html)."
