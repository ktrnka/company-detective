The company focuses on enhancing AI workflows, particularly in multimodal applications, which involve integrating various data types such as text, images, and audio. Variata's flagship product is an AI data infrastructure platform designed to streamline the development of AI applications by handling complex multimodal workloads. This allows teams to concentrate more on innovation rather than infrastructure management [(Pixeltable, 2023)](https://pixeltable.com/blog/pixeltable-launches-ai-data-infrastructure-providing-a-declarative-incremental-approach-for-multimodal-workloads-transforming-how-teams-build-ai-applications/).\n\nVariata's services include:\n\n- **User Journey Specification**: AI-assisted tools that help teams define and align on user experience objectives.\n- **Market Research Tooling**: Competitive insights gathering and A/B testing capabilities to inform design and strategy.\n- **User Experience Analytics**: Tools such as user experience playbacks, highlight reels, and heatmaps to focus on critical interactions and improve user engagement.\n\nThe company generates revenue by providing these AI-driven tools and services, primarily targeting business-to-business (B2B) customers. Variata has seen strong adoption in the AI community, particularly among teams working on generative AI applications and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. Early adopters have reported significant improvements in their operations, including a reduction in infrastructure code by up to 90% and a decrease in compute costs by 70% [(Pixeltable, 2023)](https://pixeltable.com/blog/pixeltable-launches-ai-data-infrastructure-providing-a-declarative-incremental-approach-for-multimodal-workloads-transforming-how-teams-build-ai-applications/).\n\nIn terms of distribution, Variata's products are likely offered through direct sales and partnerships, although specific details on distribution channels are not provided in the available sources.\n\nThe company has undergone significant growth, as evidenced by a successful seed funding round of $5.5 million in December 2023, led by The General Partnership and supported by several notable investors. This funding is expected to accelerate the development of Variata's core infrastructure capabilities and expand its product offerings [(Pixeltable, 2023)](https://pixeltable.com/blog/pixeltable-launches-ai-data-infrastructure-providing-a-declarative-incremental-approach-for-multimodal-workloads-transforming-how-teams-build-ai-applications/).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nDenise Kutnick is the CEO of Variata. She previously served as the Director of MLSys Product at OctoAI. Under her leadership, Variata has been recognized for its commitment to enhancing AI workflows. Denise Kutnick has emphasized the transformative impact of Variata's platform on AI development, highlighting the company's focus on operational efficiency and transparency in AI workflows [(Pixeltable, 2023)](https://pixeltable.com/blog/pixeltable-launches-ai-data-infrastructure-providing-a-declarative-incremental-approach-for-multimodal-workloads-transforming-how-teams-build-ai-applications/).\n\n# News\n\n## Funding and Growth\n\nIn December 2023, Variata's parent company, Pixeltable, announced a successful seed funding round of $5.5 million. The funding was led by The General Partnership and supported by several notable investors. This financial boost is expected to accelerate the development of Variata's core infrastructure capabilities and expand its product offerings [(Pixeltable, 2023)](https://pixeltable.com/blog/pixeltable-launches-ai-data-infrastructure-providing-a-declarative-incremental-approach-for-multimodal-workloads-transforming-how-teams-build-ai-applications/).\n\n## Product Innovations\n\nVariata's product innovations include a unified multimodal interface, automatic incremental updates, combined lineage and versioning, and a development-to-production mirror. These features are designed to enhance efficiency, transparency, and reproducibility in AI workflows [(Pixeltable, 2023)](https://pixeltable.com/blog/pixeltable-launches-ai-data-infrastructure-providing-a-declarative-incremental-approach-for-multimodal-workloads-transforming-how-teams-build-ai-applications/).\n\n## Market Position\n\nVariata has established a strong position in the AI community, particularly among teams working on generative AI applications and RAG workflows. The company's innovative solutions have led to significant improvements in operations for early adopters [(Pixeltable, 2023)](https://pixeltable.com/blog/pixeltable-launches-ai-data-infrastructure-providing-a-declarative-incremental-approach-for-multimodal-workloads-transforming-how-teams-build-ai-applications/).\n\nIn conclusion, Variata is positioned as a leader in the AI data infrastructure space, with a strong focus on multimodal applications.

Pixeltable solves this by providing a unified declarative interface that handles multimodal data workloads, incremental updates and lineage tracking, reducing infrastructure code by up to 80% and compute waste by 50%.\n\n“Just as relational databases revolutionized web development, Pixeltable is transforming AI application development,” said Marcel Kornacker, CTO and co-founder of Pixeltable. “Our platform removes the need for in-house scripting of multimodal data management and orchestration, and reduces compute costs and maintenance overhead, enabling teams to deploy production AI applications in days instead of months.”\n\nRevolutionizing AI Application Development\n\nPixeltable’s key innovations include:\n\nUnified multimodal interface: Handle video, images, audio, and text with structured and unstructured data living side by side through a consistent, intuitive table API\n\nAutomatic incremental updates: Only process new data, eliminating redundant computation\n\nCombined lineage and versioning: Track transformations from data to model inferences in one place\n\nDevelopment-to-production mirror: Same code works in both environments without rewrites\n\nFlexible integration & extensibility: Use built-in and custom Python functions (UDFs) while building tables through any standard frameworks and formats\n\nFor instance, complete video, audio and frames processing workloads can be built in just a few lines, without sacrificing algorithmic flexibility.\n\nReal-World Impact: The PixelBot Showcase\n\nThe power of Pixeltable’s approach is demonstrated through PixelBot (code), a context-aware Discord chatbot that showcases how Pixeltable solves current challenges in AI development, such as maintaining embedding indices and providing data lineage and versioning from raw data to LLM outputs.\n\n“Most AI teams face a difficult choice today,” explains Pierre Brunelle, CEO and co-founder of Pixeltable. “Either they spend months building complex infrastructure for production-ready AI applications, or they use high-level frameworks that prevent critical use cases and limit their ability to innovate. Pixeltable eliminates this tradeoff. With our declarative approach, developers can build production-grade AI applications with infinite memory and real-time context awareness in less than 100 lines of code, while maintaining full control over their custom application logics. Teams no longer have to choose between ease of development and control over their application logic.”\n\nIndustry Validation\n\n“Pixeltable has transformed our computer vision workflow,” said Adil Mohammad, Founding Engineer at Obvio and formerly Senior Deep Learning Engineer at Nvidia. “Before Pixeltable, our engineers spent 80% of their time on data plumbing. Now, they can focus on what truly matters—building better models and delivering value to our customers. With Pixeltable, we’ve reduced our infrastructure code by 90%, cut compute costs by 70%, and dramatically accelerated model iteration cycles. Its seamless integration into existing vision workflows means our team can rapidly experiment and iterate, delivering high-impact solutions faster than ever.”\n\nBeyond computer vision, Pixeltable is seeing strong adoption in generative AI applications, particularly for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The unified approach to data management streamlines RAG workflows by combining document storage, embedding computation, and incremental indexing.\n\n“Pixeltable has transformed how our ML engineers spend their time,” said Denise Kutnick, CEO of Variata, formerly Director of MLSys Product at OctoAI. “We have a highly multimodal use case, and Pixeltable gives us full visibility into the input data, models, and incremental steps of our system’s pipeline.”\n\nProven Results\n\nEarly adopters report significant improvements:\n\nReduction in infrastructure code\n\nDecrease in compute costs through incremental processing\n\nReduction in development time\n\nZero infrastructure management overhead\n\nPixeltable has also released a suite of sample AI applications on Hugging Face (huggingface.co/Pixeltable), demonstrating Pixeltable’s versatility across use cases from document processing to video analysis.\n\nIndustry Veterans at the Helm\n\nThe company was founded by:\n\nMarcel Kornacker, founder of Apache Impala and co-founder of Apache Parquet, ex-Cloudera & Google\n\nAaron Siegel, former Head of Data Platform at Airbnb and Twitter, and Head of Data at Chainlink\n\nPierre Brunelle, former CEO of Noteable (acquired by Confluent), ex-Amazon\n\n“At Airbnb, I witnessed firsthand how ML teams struggle with data,” said Aaron Siegel, co-founder and Chief AI Officer at Pixeltable. “Teams often spent more time on data plumbing than on developing their actual application logic. The recent proliferation of generative AI tools and increasing multimodality of ML workloads has only made the situation worse.“\n\nMoving Forward\n\nThe seed funding will accelerate Pixeltable’s development, focusing on:\n\nExpanding core infrastructure capabilities\n\nBuilding collaboration features focused on multimodal data management\n\nDeveloping Pixeltable Cloud, a fully-managed service\n\nPixeltable is available now as an open-source project on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 License: https://github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable\n\nAbout Pixeltable\n\nPixeltable redefines data infrastructure for AI application development. It unifies data storage, versioning, and indexing with orchestration and model versioning under a declarative table interface. By representing transformations, model inference, and custom logic as computed columns, Pixeltable enables Data Scientists and ML Engineers to focus on modeling and experimentation rather than data plumbing. With incremental updates and built-in data operation tracing, Pixeltable significantly reduces development time and resource usage while enhancing reproducibility. Pixeltable is headquartered in San Francisco and backed by leading technology investors.\n\nFor more information, visit www.pixeltable.com.\n\nMedia Contact",

I am currently planning a trip to bird in Papua New Guinea for my 40 birthday in 3 years so would like to start planning and saving now. I would love to see families new to me as well as more diverse kingfishers. Are there any ways to SAFELY go birding in New Guinea while on a tight budget/time frame?

I would love to see families new to me as well as more diverse kingfishers. Are there any ways to SAFELY go birding in New Guinea while on a tight budget/time frame? Any help or advice is appreciated.\n\nNew Guinea, yes. Papua New Guinea no.\n\nIf you want to do a safe and low cost trip to the island of New Guinea, you go to West Papua, which is part of Indonesia. If your time is limited, I suggest doing the Arfak Mountains, Sorong area, Waigeo island, and Nimbokrang.\n\nGo to the Cloud birders website and download independent trip reports.\n\nOfcourse Papua New Guinea is doable\n\ncheck e.g. :\n\nYou can also go semi-independent with Sicklebill safaris:\n\nin short: you need very, very careful planning with regards to internale flights and transport on the ground. You can't just randomly bird, but you can, e.g. arrange Varirata and some lodges in the central highlands (after an internal flight) + transport between the capital to Varirata, Mt Hagen to certain lodges (maybe those lodges can do this),... In this way, you can self-arrange a comprehensive tour, but the main issue will be that you remain restricted, and in case of mishaps / bad fortune, you're on your own in Papua which is not something everybody wants to deal with or can even deal with.\n\nNot an expert but based on our limited experience Melanesia ( in our case New Caledonia) was much cheaper than PNG mainland or PNG islands. However Waigeo and other Islands of West Papua (Raja Ampat) were much cheaper and had excellent birding.\n\nSo could be worth flying Port Moresby to Sorong (not direct) and then a ferry to Waigeo after Variata.\n\nProbably closest to your dream is visiting only West Papua where there are the same families, diverse kingfishers and birds of paradise - alhough often related but equally impressive species as in PNG. Note that it is easier, but far from easy and safe destination either.\n\nDefinitely check past threads on BF because many people had the same dream of doing New Guinea independently.\n\nNew Guinea, yes. Papua New Guinea no.\n\nIf you want to do a safe and low cost trip to the island of New Guinea, you go to West Papua, which is part of Indonesia. If your time is limited, I suggest doing the Arfak Mountains, Sorong area, Waigeo island, and Nimbokrang.\n\nGo to the Cloud birders website and download independent trip reports.\n\nNot everywhere in the west seems that safe either:\n\nNiels\n\nNot everywhere in the west seems that safe either:\n\nNiels\n\nThis is basically like reading a news report of weekend shootings in Chicago and warning that the US is unsafe! All the locations I mentioned are, to my knowledge, safe to visit.\n\nNot everywhere in the west seems that safe either:\n\nNiels\n\nTrue, and e.g. the Lake Habbema area isn't accessible for some years. I don't know the details but I heard it has to do with tribes fighting over land rights, and tourists (who are paying for access on those lands) inevitably are a point of discussion (tourists visiting the land of tribe A = money for tribe A, but if tribe B doesn't agree the land belongs to tribe A...).\n\nIn any case, as DMW writes above, there are 'safe' parts and it isn't hard to figure out where. But also for those parts, it takes a local guide as land rights are an issue / point of concern everywhere in (W-)Papua.",
