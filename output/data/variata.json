      "# Post ID 10m8q2b: A Book Review of the Annotated Large Catechism: Much Ado About Nothing? with +38 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LCMS/comments/10m8q2b/a_book_review_of_the_annotated_large_catechism/)\nBelow is my book review for CPH’s Annotated Large Catechism. Keep in mind that I’m only a seminarian and know just enough to get myself into trouble. Where you think I’m wrong, please, let me know. Where you think I’m right, well, it was probably dumb luck. A broken clock and all that. Most of all, don’t let my poorly written review get in the way of reading this book. Nothing I have to say matters more than the words found therein:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, the task is done. Sort of. I have finished reading all of the introductions and essays found within CPH's new Annotated Large Catechism, 95 by my count. What a fitting number for a book that continues on the legacy of great Lutheran writings. I hope to make my way through all of the annotations next, but that will take some time.\n\nGiven the uproar about the contents of this book, I fully expected myself to become a full-blown liberal by the end of it and to seek shelter in the nearest ELCA church. In fact, when defending this book online, that was often the advice that I received. Apparently I'd be better off in the ELCA. Alas, no such luck for the advice-givers. Having read the book, I find that my orthodox and confessional views remain largely the same, although some of my presuppositions were certainly challenged along the way, and for that, I am very grateful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what was all the fuss about? I've seen the complaints and I've listened to the Youtube videos. I've read the tweets and the angry blog posts. In fact, had I not encountered these responses I almost certainly would not have bought the book before it was pulled from distribution. Going into this book, all I knew about it was from those raising the concerns. Recognizing that these concerns probably came from a good place (for most people, anyways), I tried to take them seriously and read the book as critically as I could. If this book was as terrible as some made it out to be, it wouldn't be long before I found the damaging content. Or so I thought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI read the essays in the order they came. Starting with President Harrison's forward and ending with Kuhlman's essay  on Private Confession, I found no shortage of quality essays throughout. Some of them challenged me to think about the Large Catechism in a new light; other's affirmed what I had always thought; still some challenged my assumptions and left me pondering the essay for the rest of the night. What I never found, however, was the smoking gun that I was assured was in there. Rather, I found that where the book dealt with controversial topics, it dealt with them in a scriptural way, using the confessions and Luther's other writings as a guide.\n\nSo what about those infamous screenshots? Well, the answer is relatively simple and I think most people realized it from the get-go. Those screenshots are just that - screenshots. They don't allow for the context of the essay to be accounted for. The most stark example of this comes in Dr. Biermann's essay on the 5th commandment. There were howls that Dr. Biermann had crossed the line! Here he was saying that self-defense was wrong and that owning weapons is sinful! How could he? There's just one problem, though. That's not what he said. In fact, his entire essay points to how self-defense and the power of the sword are \"God-pleasing\" when used correctly. He goes on to explain that the 5th commandment is related to vocation (duh! We're Lutherans. Everything is related to vocation), and it is from this relationship that the power of the sword becomes justified. Only a person with terrible reading comprehension, or a person who goes into an article looking for heresy and viewing everything in the worst possible way, could read Biermann's essay and come away genuinely believing what the howlers had said. There really is no other explanation.\n\nThe examples of poor reading comprehension, combined with an anti-8th commandment approach to what was written, are simply too numerous for me to go through one-by-one in this review. I would encourage anyone (if they're brave enough) to go to Twitter and pick a complaint at random. Then, go to the relevant essay and ask yourself if the complaint holds any water. I would wager my life-savings (about 5 dollars since I'm a seminarian) that you'll find the complaint to be both meritless and needlessly divisive. Of course, in order to do that, you'll actually have to read the entire essay in question, which for many people (especially the howlers) is apparently asking too much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo were all of the complaints wrong? No, of course not. As I mentioned earlier, I believe many of the complaints came from a good place. The fact that we in the LCMS have laymen and clergy who care deeply about doctrinal purity is a wonderful thing. If you want to see what happens when a church body ceases caring about doctrine, just go visit the nearest mainline protestant church. The woman pastor will be happy to explain it to you after their joint service with the local pagan temple and before their rebaptism and naming ceremony of one of the daughters, er, sons of the congregation.\n\nSo what complaints were valid? In my opinion, there are two legitimate complaints. First, authors from outside the LCMS, along with women, were allowed to write these essays. Second, placing these subjective essays alongside the objective works of Luther is at best confusing and at worst, deceitful. I think the latter complaint is more reasonable, but I'll quickly respond to both.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as authorship, I'm not sure that we should be so quick to disregard the writings of anyone who is not in the LCMS. Where does that approach end? Can a pastor recommend Lewis or Chesterton to a parishioner? What about hymns from Wesley? For me, the hardline stance that anything written outside of the LCMS should not be used ends up creating more questions than it answers.\n\nPersonally, I enjoy reading the contemporary takes in this book. That being said, not everyone will. By placing these essays alongside the Large Catechism, we might be setting up our members for failure. What happens if a layman finds that he doesn't agree with Dr. Nunes' essay about the 7th, 9th, and 10th commandments? Does that mean that he disagrees with Luther as well? And if he disagrees with Luther in the Large Catechism, what else in our confessions does he not agree with? You can see how someone might stumble here. Perhaps a better approach would have been to include all of the essays at the end of the book in an appendix, with a clear warning that they are not part of the confessions and don't have to be agreed with. I'm not sure what the best approach is, but I recognize the concern with how the book was set up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, I found that these essays were a joy to read. A collection of writings from some of the brightest minds in the synod, alongside the always relevant words of Martin Luther, this book did not disappoint. I was able to purchase my copy before the distribution was halted. Should the pause be lifted and the book become available again, I would recommend it without reservation for any laymen or clergymen who desire to see what Luther's words mean for us today. You may not agree with every essay, and that's perfectly fine. I sure didn't love every word that I read. But rather than running away from that disagreement, lean into it. Read the essay, read the critiques (at least the well informed and reasonable ones), and determine who is right for yourself. Let the essays and the words of Luther continue to challenge you. I did, and it was a wonderful experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn Christ,\n\nMichael Speckhard\n\n## Comment ID j61qmj3 with +21 score by [(Luscious_Nick, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LCMS/comments/10m8q2b/a_book_review_of_the_annotated_large_catechism/j61qmj3/) (in reply to ID 10m8q2b):\nThank you for the in depth analysis. \n\nI figured it was the typical outrage over the alleged Marxist in the closet\n\n## Comment ID j61xm5u with +6 score by [(anywenny, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LCMS/comments/10m8q2b/a_book_review_of_the_annotated_large_catechism/j61xm5u/) (in reply to ID 10m8q2b):\nSerious question—are there copies of the now-halted LC still available for purchase anywhere?

Paulson confesses blasphemous things about Christ, on top of communing with the ELCA. He's a far cry from the errors of Lewis or Chesterton. I'd definitely draw a hard line at outright blasphemy, wouldn't you?\n\nSecond, you didn't address the third complaint about the essays: that at least some of the essays contained problematic, downright false, content. For example, the essay on homosexuality inferred that someone who cross-dresses or rejects \"gender roles\" could just be a struggling Christian. A sheep listening to the voice of his shepherd may have come from a place like that, but if that sheep is listening, he is not still going to continue cross-dressing. His use of the term \"homosexual Christian\" is also wrong; Scripture clearly teaches that homosexuals will not enter the kingdom of God. If the argument \n\nOr what about Malueg-Lattimore's obvious promotion of the Marxist idea of \"racial justice,\" along with which he adds a call for the church to bear *responsibility* for social unrest? He even misquotes Galatians 6 in the word of Bonhoeffer, saying that the church bears an \"unconditional obligation to help victims of any societal order,\" implying that black people are victims such as the Jews were during Bonhoeffer's time.\n\nThere's death in this pot, thanks to the ideologies of the day creeping into the minds of some of these writers.\n\n### Comment ID j6uisap with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LCMS/comments/10m8q2b/a_book_review_of_the_annotated_large_catechism/j6uisap/) (in reply to ID j6uflez):\nI appreciate the counter-review. It's always good to hear what others are thinking. I'll just take your points in order.\n\n1. I understand the concern about authorship. My concern is where it ends. Can we use any material from someone outside the LCMS? What about in our hymnals? Those are full of non-LCMS writings, and hymns are certainly didactic in nature. Did you find anything objectionable in Paulson's essay? Or is it just his previous works that bother you?\n2. I still haven't seen the 'smoking gun' heretical content, even in the essays you mentioned. Of course someone can be a struggling Christian who lapses into sin still. By your logic the church would not have any sin in it. The sinners would come to the pastor, he would instruct them not to sin, and they'd stop right away. In theory that would be great, but that's simply not the world we live in. The Old Adam in all of us is quite strong, unfortunately. I also reject your understanding of the term \"homosexual-Christian\". I personally know many Christians who struggle with homosexual attraction. They know it is a sin but they still struggle with it. To pretend as though the two things are mutually exclusive just doesn't make any sense.\n3. Could you quote the Maleug-Lattimore essay where he says those things? I want to make sure I'm responding to the correct quotes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs everything in this book perfect? No, of course not. There are times when vague wording is used when clearer language would have been beneficial. Many of the essays were overly simplistic in my opinion. There is no death in the pot, though. Perhaps there are some ingredients you don't personally like, but that doesn't make them poisonous. It just means you don't like them.\n\n#### Comment ID j6vwfe4 with +3 score by [(PiedPorcupine, Reddit, 2023-02-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LCMS/comments/10m8q2b/a_book_review_of_the_annotated_large_catechism/j6vwfe4/) (in reply to ID j6uisap):\n1. I didn't find anything particularly objectionable in Paulson's essay (I didn't read it thoroughly though)-- like I said before though, I think a definite line to draw is at publishing open heretics. It shows a support of heresy from the LCMS, especially given Paulson's well-known notoriety in the Church. As for other non-LCMS-ers, I'd imagine a blanket statement wouldn't cut it. It'd probably have to be on a case-by-case basis. There's a difference between heresy and heterodoxy, after all.\n\n2. So, I'm not denying that there are Christians who struggle with unnatural attraction. There are Christians who struggle with anger, who struggle with sinful heterosexual thoughts of attraction, etc. All those thoughts are sinful, of course, and are damaging to faith, but there's a difference between a sin that you can fall into and a sin that no one can cause you to do but yourself. So, the actual homosexual act is of course, one of those. Murder is another. I think cross-dressing is probably another in the same camp, in the same way the sin of self-abuse is. It's an active, knowing indulgence in a sin that causes a loss of faith and the Holy Spirit. Something like anger, on the other hand, isn't in this category, because an outburst of anger, although a sin, is not a meditated, actively planned sin. That being said, the issue with that article isn't his compassion on those who struggle against the desire, it's his grouping the strugglers with people who actively do the things like cross-dress or live lives not conforming to \"gender roles.\" (I suppose you could put gracious construction on latter, like maybe he's referring to stay-at-home dads, but in the context of the article it's pretty clear he's talking about the guy who talks gay because he feels feminine, or a girl who tries to act butch and shaves her head because she doesn't want to \"conform\" to what womanliness is. It's not in those behaviors per se, but in the underlying attitude towards God's order that I don't feel comfortable saying it fits with the Christian life.)\n\n3. (I'm using the ebook, so my citation might be off) The quote is on page 364: \"One way to be the church during social unrest is to bear responsibility, recognizing we have the ability to respond in ways that can build up and tear down... Dietrich Bonhoeffer argued that 'the church has an unconditional obligation toward the victims of any societal order, even if they do not belong to the Christian community.'\" Upon reading this again, it seems that the word \"responsibility\" refers to responsible action, not taking the blame for social issues. But the other problem still stands-- his inference that such oppressive societal orders as Bonhoeffer dealt with exist in America today in our issues of \"social justice.\" The other quote that zones in on Malueg-Lattimore's intended context is the circulated footnote: \"The deaths of a number of Black citizens at the hands of white individuals and police officers sparked widespread protests...especially in 2020.\" You can't deny the interpretation inferred by the capitalization of \"black\" and the specific reference to the police, whiteness, and 2020.\n\nI'm not making the argument that the book is bad because I don't like a few of the essays. I'm making the argument that the book shouldn't be published with the problematic essays because they give dangerous false teaching.\n\n## Comment ID j6folmu with +2 score by [(coronatextor, Reddit, 2023-01-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LCMS/comments/10m8q2b/a_book_review_of_the_annotated_large_catechism/j6folmu/) (in reply to ID 10m8q2b):\nThanks for the thoughtful review.   \n\n\nI think the most important thing is that we regain an appreciation of the eighth commandment in our synod (which could be easily accomplished by continually returning to the Catechisms). If anything has been an argument for me leaving the LCMS these last few years, it's been the incredible number of ordained pastors (and in some cases district presidents) blatantly and publicly breaking the eighth commandment (especially by assuming or accusing without any evidence or investigation), but I know pastors are sinners too and it's here that I have received the purest proclamation of Christ's work and promises and I know I can't get that as purely (or perhaps at all) at an RC or BC or EO &c &c parish.  \n\n\nYou identified my primary concern in what you called your second concern. It's the reason my \"study bible\" is simply the Bible, my catechism with applications is simply the SC/LC, and (someday) my hymnal will be the Lutheran liturgy, including the psalms and the core Lutheran hymns. I'll also want a supplement with other great hymns such as \"Stricken, Smitten, and Afflicted\" but I don't want to imply approval of the Kellyites by inclusion of even Kelly's most Christian hymns in the core (literal) culture. The hymnbook is a tougher project to think through because it's not the inerrant Word of God or the symbols to which we subscribe (to whatever degree, be it quatenus, quia, or scaer), but I'm for some reason (justifiable or unjustifiable) apparently fine with Melanchthon's hymn, for example, even though I suppose someone might become a Phillipist and start following the Variata, but my core concern is that we let our symbols be our symbols and have other (and many) avenues for essays and commentaries &c. Maybe that's too idealistic but I'm all for fewer \\*omnibus\\*(es) and more \\*solis\\*.\n\n## Comment ID j74gywv with +2 score by [(Dear_Pair7015, Reddit, 2023-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LCMS/comments/10m8q2b/a_book_review_of_the_annotated_large_catechism/j74gywv/) (in reply to ID 10m8q2b):\nYour analysis, Michael, is well written and well argued. Perhaps if the essays had been placed collectively apart from the material in the Larger Catechism that might have helped \"rope off\" opinion from Luther's original material. The Apocrypha in Bibles that include extra-canonical material does just that. \n\nMy hunch is that many folks in the LCMS will skip purchasing this new volume and continue on with the work of the kingdom. One of the great virtues of religious freedom (and the freedom of the Christian, in particular) is walking away from perspectives that generate more heat than light. Life here is short and the field is white for the harvest. Let us be found laboring when our Lord returns. \n\nYour senses of purpose and humor serve you well! Keep up the good work!\n\nRev. Dr. Robert M. Doak  (recent LCMS transplant)\n\n### Comment ID j76k2pm with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LCMS/comments/10m8q2b/a_book_review_of_the_annotated_large_catechism/j76k2pm/) (in reply to ID j74gywv):\nI appreciate the kind words, Dr. Doak. I couldn't agree more with your second paragraph."

      "# [Pixeltable launches AI data infrastructure providing a declarative, incremental approach for multimodal workloads transforming, how teams build AI applications – Pixeltable](https://pixeltable.com/blog/pixeltable-launches-ai-data-infrastructure-providing-a-declarative-incremental-approach-for-multimodal-workloads-transforming-how-teams-build-ai-applications/)\nSAN FRANCISCO, CA, December 5, 2023 — Pixeltable today announced the launch of its open-source AI data infrastructure, backed by a $5.5 million seed round led by The General Partnership, with participation from Exceptional Capital, South Park Commons, Liquid 2, Zero Knowledge Ventures, Serena Data ventures, and notable industry veterans including Christian Beedgen (cofounder of Sumo Logic), Michael Stoppelman (Angel Investor & Former SVP of Engineering at Yelp), Wes McKinney (Principal Architect, Posit), Bill Hsieh (Bridge Street Advisors), and Steven Mih (CEO Across AI, former CEO of Aviatrix, Alluxio, and Ahana).\n\nAs AI applications become increasingly multimodal and complex, teams spend more time managing infrastructure than innovating. Pixeltable solves this by providing a unified declarative interface that handles multimodal data workloads, incremental updates and lineage tracking, reducing infrastructure code by up to 80% and compute waste by 50%.\n\n“Just as relational databases revolutionized web development, Pixeltable is transforming AI application development,” said Marcel Kornacker, CTO and co-founder of Pixeltable. “Our platform removes the need for in-house scripting of multimodal data management and orchestration, and reduces compute costs and maintenance overhead, enabling teams to deploy production AI applications in days instead of months.”\n\nRevolutionizing AI Application Development\n\nPixeltable’s key innovations include:\n\nUnified multimodal interface: Handle video, images, audio, and text with structured and unstructured data living side by side through a consistent, intuitive table API\n\nAutomatic incremental updates: Only process new data, eliminating redundant computation\n\nCombined lineage and versioning: Track transformations from data to model inferences in one place\n\nDevelopment-to-production mirror: Same code works in both environments without rewrites\n\nFlexible integration & extensibility: Use built-in and custom Python functions (UDFs) while building tables through any standard frameworks and formats\n\nFor instance, complete video, audio and frames processing workloads can be built in just a few lines, without sacrificing algorithmic flexibility.\n\nReal-World Impact: The PixelBot Showcase\n\nThe power of Pixeltable’s approach is demonstrated through PixelBot (code), a context-aware Discord chatbot that showcases how Pixeltable solves current challenges in AI development, such as maintaining embedding indices and providing data lineage and versioning from raw data to LLM outputs.\n\n“Most AI teams face a difficult choice today,” explains Pierre Brunelle, CEO and co-founder of Pixeltable. “Either they spend months building complex infrastructure for production-ready AI applications, or they use high-level frameworks that prevent critical use cases and limit their ability to innovate. Pixeltable eliminates this tradeoff. With our declarative approach, developers can build production-grade AI applications with infinite memory and real-time context awareness in less than 100 lines of code, while maintaining full control over their custom application logics. Teams no longer have to choose between ease of development and control over their application logic.”\n\nIndustry Validation\n\n“Pixeltable has transformed our computer vision workflow,” said Adil Mohammad, Founding Engineer at Obvio and formerly Senior Deep Learning Engineer at Nvidia. “Before Pixeltable, our engineers spent 80% of their time on data plumbing. Now, they can focus on what truly matters—building better models and delivering value to our customers. With Pixeltable, we’ve reduced our infrastructure code by 90%, cut compute costs by 70%, and dramatically accelerated model iteration cycles. Its seamless integration into existing vision workflows means our team can rapidly experiment and iterate, delivering high-impact solutions faster than ever.”\n\nBeyond computer vision, Pixeltable is seeing strong adoption in generative AI applications, particularly for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The unified approach to data management streamlines RAG workflows by combining document storage, embedding computation, and incremental indexing.\n\n“Pixeltable has transformed how our ML engineers spend their time,” said Denise Kutnick, CEO of Variata, formerly Director of MLSys Product at OctoAI. “We have a highly multimodal use case, and Pixeltable gives us full visibility into the input data, models, and incremental steps of our system’s pipeline.”\n\nProven Results\n\nEarly adopters report significant improvements:\n\nReduction in infrastructure code\n\nDecrease in compute costs through incremental processing\n\nReduction in development time\n\nZero infrastructure management overhead\n\nPixeltable has also released a suite of sample AI applications on Hugging Face (huggingface.co/Pixeltable), demonstrating Pixeltable’s versatility across use cases from document processing to video analysis.\n\nIndustry Veterans at the Helm\n\nThe company was founded by:\n\nMarcel Kornacker, founder of Apache Impala and co-founder of Apache Parquet, ex-Cloudera & Google\n\nAaron Siegel, former Head of Data Platform at Airbnb and Twitter, and Head of Data at Chainlink\n\nPierre Brunelle, former CEO of Noteable (acquired by Confluent), ex-Amazon\n\n“At Airbnb, I witnessed firsthand how ML teams struggle with data,” said Aaron Siegel, co-founder and Chief AI Officer at Pixeltable. “Teams often spent more time on data plumbing than on developing their actual application logic. The recent proliferation of generative AI tools and increasing multimodality of ML workloads has only made the situation worse.“\n\nMoving Forward\n\nThe seed funding will accelerate Pixeltable’s development, focusing on:\n\nExpanding core infrastructure capabilities\n\nBuilding collaboration features focused on multimodal data management\n\nDeveloping Pixeltable Cloud, a fully-managed service\n\nPixeltable is available now as an open-source project on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 License: https://github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable\n\nAbout Pixeltable\n\nPixeltable redefines data infrastructure for AI application development. It unifies data storage, versioning, and indexing with orchestration and model versioning under a declarative table interface. By representing transformations, model inference, and custom logic as computed columns, Pixeltable enables Data Scientists and ML Engineers to focus on modeling and experimentation rather than data plumbing. With incremental updates and built-in data operation tracing, Pixeltable significantly reduces development time and resource usage while enhancing reproducibility. Pixeltable is headquartered in San Francisco and backed by leading technology investors.\n\nFor more information, visit www.pixeltable.com.\n\nMedia Contact",

Papua New Guinea no.\n\nIf you want to do a safe and low cost trip to the island of New Guinea, you go to West Papua, which is part of Indonesia. If your time is limited, I suggest doing the Arfak Mountains, Sorong area, Waigeo island, and Nimbokrang.\n\nGo to the Cloud birders website and download independent trip reports.\n\nOfcourse Papua New Guinea is doable\n\ncheck e.g. :\n\nYou can also go semi-independent with Sicklebill safaris:\n\nin short: you need very, very careful planning with regards to internale flights and transport on the ground. You can't just randomly bird, but you can, e.g. arrange Varirata and some lodges in the central highlands (after an internal flight) + transport between the capital to Varirata, Mt Hagen to certain lodges (maybe those lodges can do this),... In this way, you can self-arrange a comprehensive tour, but the main issue will be that you remain restricted, and in case of mishaps / bad fortune, you're on your own in Papua which is not something everybody wants to deal with or can even deal with.\n\nNot an expert but based on our limited experience Melanesia ( in our case New Caledonia) was much cheaper than PNG mainland or PNG islands. However Waigeo and other Islands of West Papua (Raja Ampat) were much cheaper and had excellent birding.\n\nSo could be worth flying Port Moresby to Sorong (not direct) and then a ferry to Waigeo after Variata.\n\nProbably closest to your dream is visiting only West Papua where there are the same families, diverse kingfishers and birds of paradise - alhough often related but equally impressive species as in PNG. Note that it is easier, but far from easy and safe destination either.\n\nDefinitely check past threads on BF because many people had the same dream of doing New Guinea independently.\n\nNew Guinea, yes. Papua New Guinea no.\n\nIf you want to do a safe and low cost trip to the island of New Guinea, you go to West Papua, which is part of Indonesia. If your time is limited, I suggest doing the Arfak Mountains, Sorong area, Waigeo island, and Nimbokrang.\n\nGo to the Cloud birders website and download independent trip reports.\n\nNot everywhere in the west seems that safe either:\n\nNiels\n\nNot everywhere in the west seems that safe either:\n\nNiels\n\nThis is basically like reading a news report of weekend shootings in Chicago and warning that the US is unsafe! All the locations I mentioned are, to my knowledge, safe to visit.\n\nNot everywhere in the west seems that safe either:\n\nNiels\n\nTrue, and e.g. the Lake Habbema area isn't accessible for some years. I don't know the details but I heard it has to do with tribes fighting over land rights, and tourists (who are paying for access on those lands) inevitably are a point of discussion (tourists visiting the land of tribe A = money for tribe A, but if tribe B doesn't agree the land belongs to tribe A...).\n\nIn any case, as DMW writes above, there are 'safe' parts and it isn't hard to figure out where. But also for those parts, it takes a local guide as land rights are an issue / point of concern everywhere in (W-)Papua.",

      "# [The Prophetic Role of the Protestant Reformation by Jordan Steffaniak, Jordan Ballor on 2024-06-10](https://thelondonlyceum.com/the-prophetic-role-of-the-protestant-reformation/)\nNote: This is the online version of an essay from the Hanover Review 3.1 on the Reformation as Renewal Symposium. Print copies are available here and full digital copies of the issue are available here. Full details about the symposium can be found here. More information about the Hanover Review is found here.\n\nIn his commentary on the book of Isaiah, John Calvin writes concerning the prophetic office that “the shortest way of treating this subject is to trace the Prophets to the Law, from which they derived their doctrine, like streams from a fountain.” That is to say, the prophets related to the law “as their rule, so that they may be justly held and declared to be its interpreters, who utter nothing but what is connected with the Law.” The prophets were to interpret and apply the law of God to their contemporary circumstances. The prophetic office “was not intended to make any addition to the Law, but to interpret it faithfully, and to sanction its authority.” Calvin goes on to describe the continuities of the divine law across covenantal administrations, and how it reaches its fulfillment in “the coming of Christ, who was both the foundation of the covenant and the bond of the mutual relation between God and the people, and to whom therefore the whole extent of the promises must be understood to refer.”\n\n“Whoever understands this,” writes Calvin, “will easily learn what we ought to seek in the Prophets, and what is the purpose of their writings.” Moreover, with this understanding of the prophetic role in place, we can adapt this model to our own times: “Hence we may learn in what manner the doctrine of the word should be handled, and that we ought to imitate the Prophets, who conveyed the doctrine of the Law in such a manner as to draw from it advices, reproofs, threatenings, and consolations, which they applied to the present condition of the people.” In this way, without denying the possibility of special divine revelation concerning the future or hidden mysteries, Calvin grounds the prophetic office in interpreting and applying God’s law to contemporary circumstances. This requires a constant dynamic movement from the past to the present, from the given, established, and unchangeable law to the contingent, current, and mutable situation of the present. Thus, observes Calvin, “it is of high importance to us to compare the behaviour of the men of our own age with the behaviour of that ancient people; and from their histories and examples we ought to make known the judgments of God.”\n\nConsider the narrative of the discovery of the book of the law in the time of King Josiah. As we read in 2 Kings 22, Hilkiah the high priest discovered the Book of the Law, and Josiah orders the book to be read aloud. “When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his robes” (2 Kings 22:11). Josiah immediately understands what the loss of the knowledge of the law means for his people: “Great is the Lord’s anger that burns against us because those who have gone before us have not obeyed the words of this book; they have not acted in accordance with all that is written there concerning us” (2 Kings 22:13). But when the book is found again and the knowledge of God’s will as communicated in his law is known, there is the possibility for renewal and reform of the monarchy, the priesthood, the nation, and the people. In fact, the prophet Huldah communicates God’s will to Josiah, promising judgment because the nation has abandoned God’s law and commanding a return to righteous living. In response, Josiah acts decisively:\n\nThen the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. He went up to the temple of the Lord with the people of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests and the prophets—all the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the Lord. The king stood by the pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the Lord—to follow the Lord and keep his commands, statutes and decrees with all his heart and all his soul, thus confirming the words of the covenant written in this book. Then all the people pledged themselves to the covenant. (2 Kings 23:1-3)\n\nThis general vision of the prophetic office in relationship to the law of God, and even its particular manifestation in the case of King Josiah and the rediscovery of the Book of the Law, is an appropriate model for the self-understanding of the Protestant Reformation. Calvin himself refers to this episode during Josiah’s reign as evidence of God’s providential care for his people and the constant need to return to God’s law as the norm and rule for doctrine and practice. “The law of Moses was wonderfully preserved by heavenly providence rather than by human effort,” writes Calvin. “And although by priests’ negligence the law lay buried for a short time, after godly King Josiah found it, it continued to be read age after age. Indeed, Josiah did not put it forward as something unknown or new, but as something that had always been of common knowledge, the memory of which was then famous.”\n\n“Why is it,” wonders Calvin concerning the law, “that almost no age goes by in which its sanction is not confirmed and renewed?” It was as true in the days of Josiah as it was in Calvin’s own time. After a period of increasing deformation of the church’s teaching and practice, Luther’s rediscovery of the doctrines of grace is understood as akin to Hilkiah’s rediscovery of the Book of the Law. As a result, Luther, Calvin, and all the other Protestant reformers function as prophets, calling the church back to its foundations and practice in accord with right interpretation and application of God’s word. This prophetic call can be summarized in the marks of the true church as related in the Belgic Confession (Article 29):\n\nThe marks by which the true church is known are these: If the pure doctrine of the gospel is preached therein; if it maintains the pure administration of the sacraments as instituted by Christ; if church discipline is exercised in punishing of sin; in short, if all things are managed according to the pure Word of God, all things contrary thereto rejected, and Jesus Christ acknowledged as the only Head of the church. Hereby the true Church may certainly be known, from which no man has a right to separate himself.\n\nIndeed, in his introductory letter to King Edward VI included with his commentary on Isaiah, Calvin provides a brief survey of precisely this kind of historical narrative. With the advent of Christ, “Pure religion, which formerly lay despised in Judea, as in a dark corner, was circulated through all nations and provinces, and began to be honoured in such a manner, that innumerable tongues, in harmony of faith, called on God.” The growth and vitality that the church experienced in the apostolic and patristic eras, however, was not to abide. In this decline, writes Calvin, “Some remains, indeed, God preserved, as it were in places of concealment; but, as to the external beauty of the Church, nothing but desolation, confusion, and dispersion, was to be seen for many centuries.” But out of this regrettable and deplorable state, “in our age, contrary to the expectation of all, the Lord hath again begun to raise up that which was fallen, (Amos 9:11,) that there might at least be left among us an outline of the true temple, in which God should be worshipped with purity, and according to the requirements of the Gospel.”\n\nThus Calvin encourages Edward VI, as he does all other political and ecclesial leaders of his age, “to proceed, to the utmost of your ability and power, in carrying forward the restoration of the Church.” Matthew Barrett’s Reformation as Renewal: Retrieving the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church takes up this self-understanding of the Protestant Reformers in an ambitious and robust attempt to grapple with this multifaceted, complex, and world-shaping phenomenon.\n\n1. The Reformation in the Self-Understanding of the Reformers\n\nThe nineteenth-century German philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey described what he called the canons of immanence and coherence as necessary for proper historical understanding. The canon of immanence has to do with a contextualized approach that is sensitive to the internal logic and coherence of a figure, movement, or phenomenon. For the study of human thought and action, the canon of immanence requires a level of sympathy on the part of the researcher. The goal is to come to understand someone as they understand themselves, to see them as they see themselves.\n\nOnly after achieving some level of insight and understanding on the basis of the canon of immanence can the historian move beyond the limits of that contextualized self-understanding to properly assess the significance and validity of a historical figure. In the canon of coherence or totality, the details and particularities of a historical phenomenon are assessed and considered in a broader perspective. As Theodore Plantinga describes the relationship between these two principles, “The movement back and forth between part and whole should result ultimately in a universal historical perspective.” Whether or not the absolute validity of something like Dilthey’s approach is actually achievable given the inevitable subjective and evaluative nature of all historical investigation, the dynamic between the relative, contextualized self-understanding of a historical person and the broader, universal meaning must be acknowledged and appropriately balanced in all responsible history.\n\nBarrett has done precisely this in his Reformation as Renewal. The point of departure of this study is the self-understanding of the Reformers as restorers, to use Calvin’s language, or as prophets in his depiction of the prophetic office, calling the church back to its grounding, re-forming it and correcting its deformations according to its original constitution. As Barrett puts it directly and emphatically, “the Reformers did not think the Reformation was primarily a revolution for new, modern ideas, but a retrieval and renewal of the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church.” The major verbs for understanding this movement on its own terms are thus restoring, renewing, retrieving, and reforming. Barrett’s volume takes this perspective as its point of departure and traces this sensibility through the history of the church, surveying in brief form the advent of scholasticism in the Middle Ages and precursors to the reform movements of the sixteenth century before focusing especially on the ways in which figures like Luther, Calvin, and others advanced distinctive and in some ways complementary programs for purifying corruption from the church of their day.\n\nIn beginning with something like the canon of immanence, Barrett’s work is a welcome corrective to so much historical work that advances from the supposedly superior understanding of today to evaluate the validity and significance of the Reformation. If Barrett is primarily concerned with accurately depicting the Protestant Reformers in their own self-understanding, other projects, notably Brad S. Gregory’s The Unintended Reformation, begin with something like the canon of totality, which devalues the importance of a sympathetic, inside-out understanding of these figures. As Gregory puts it, what the Reformers thought about themselves and their projects is irrelevant to what they actually did and how they ought to be evaluated. In his examination of the secularization of modern science, for instance, Gregory writes, “Protestant reformers sought to restore a proper understanding of the relationship between God and creation as they respectively understood it.” But despite this intention, the unintended results were disastrous. For Gregory, the decisive shift as regards the Protestant contribution to the rise of secularized science comes in an abandonment of classical metaphysical assumptions: “The widespread acceptance of a new metaphysics set the stage for conceptions in modern science about the mutual exclusivity of natural causality and transcendent, divine presence.” This new metaphysics, including the mechanical philosophy and the resulting “domestication of God’s transcendence and the extrusion of his presence from the natural world,” when combined with the doctrinal intractability between Protestants and Roman Catholics, created the setting for modern science.\n\nGregory’s narrative with respect to the advent of science is part of a larger story, which as he puts it requires a new historical methodology. Although he begins with science, Gregory proceeds to discuss areas including morality, economics, politics, and academics more broadly:\n\nEach chapter analyzes a consequential historical trajectory within a particular domain of human life, noting along the way some of its relationships to the other domains analyzed. As a whole the book thus constitutes an explanation about the makings of modernity as both a multifaceted rejection and a variegated appropriation of different elements of medieval Christianity. None of the chapters stands alone; the overarching argument depends on each being taken in conjunction with the others.\n\nGregory calls this approach, which eschews concern for the self- understanding of the Reformers in favor of a normative, totalizing evaluation of the consequences of their thought, genealogical or analytical history.\n\nIn this way Barrett’s more traditional approach, which relies on the scholarship of a host of figures including Heiko Oberman, David Steinmetz, Richard Muller, Bruce Gordon, Marilyn McCord Adams, Willem van Asselt, and others, is refreshing in that it allows the reader to better take the Reformation on its own terms. Thus, writes Barrett:\n\nYet the Reformers did not set out to start a new church, let alone a new denomination; they intended to reform the only church they knew, a catholic church they still believed possessed and practiced legitimate marks of a true church (e.g., baptism), even if this church was polluted by the papacy’s innovations and political machinations.\n\nThe contrast, not only in method but also in conclusions, between Gregory and Barrett can be seen in Gregory’s points concerning the metaphysical assumptions of the Reformers. For Gregory, Protestants appropriated the Scotist doctrine of univocity and later developments, such as Ockham’s nominalism, as part of their rejection of the medieval church. What Gregory puts in terms of probabilities is absolutized in the larger narrative about Protestants: “Some of their departures from the traditional Christian view seem to have implied univocal metaphysical assumptions in ways that probably did contribute to an eventual conception of a disenchanted natural world.”\n\nBarrett, by contrast, emphasizes the classical continuities between the mainstream of the magisterial Protestants and ancient and medieval sources. Barrett is part of a larger scholarly effort to advance an understanding of Christian orthodoxy as having distinct metaphysical assumptions, foundations, and entailments. In this way Barrett depicts the classical theology proper as a kind of Christian Platonism and Thomas Aquinas as perhaps the model par excellence of this tradition. As Barrett summarizes with respect to the Reformers’ position in this narrative, “however much first-generation Reformers may have been tinged by sporadic influences of nominalism (itself a contested claim), the late sixteenth century and seventeenth century Reformed Scholastics were far more at home in the realism of Christian Platonism that spanned the Great Tradition, particularly the Aristotelian and Thomistic variety.” This is a welcome corrective to the reductive historical approaches that have all too often elided Scotism, nominalism, and Protestantism.\n\nAt the same time, we can also see here some dangers with an approach that emphasizes contextual sensitivity in historical interpretation and yet nevertheless imports some anachronistic or contemporary concerns into the narrative. It may well be, and I find it convincing, that there is a great deal of continuity between the mainstream of Protestant reformers, especially in the Reformed tradition, and the thought of Thomas Aquinas, on a wide variety of points, some metaphysical, some doctrinal, and some moral and practical. But it is not the case that the Reformers as such were concerned with being faithful Thomists. The teaching of Thomas Aquinas, whether engaged directly or filtered through various traditions and appropriated as such, was of instrumental value to the Reformers. The point for the Reformers in engaging Thomas was not so that they could become more faithful Thomists. Rather, they used Thomas to the extent that they found Thomas and his teachings helpful in clarifying the true teachings of the church and necessary reforms. The same is true, mutatis mutandis, for other predecessors, whether Bernard of Clairvaux, Duns Scotus, or Gregory of Rimini, which explains in part the persistent eclecticism of the Reformers—considered both individually and corporately—even where there is more or less clear dependence or reliance on an earlier authority. In this way, there is the potential for misunderstanding if something identified as Reformed Thomism or Calvinist Thomism is taken to mean that there was a self-styled attempt by Reformed theologians to be Thomists in the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries. This is not to deny that there is substantive continuity and even reliance on Thomas by Reformed theologians of this era. The “sounder scholastics” (like Thomas) are put to positive use more often essentially because they are sounder. But where a Reformer thinks that Thomas is mistaken or not helpful, there is little hesitation to depart from (or ignore) his thought.\n\nThe same is true, we might say, for a broader term like Christian Platonism, at least insofar as it is taken to be identical to the Great Tradition. Terminology matters, and as helpful as it is to note the positive dependence on Plato and Platonism by so many in the church throughout the ages, virtually no one (or very few, and these are almost certain to be outliers and eccentrics) is concerned with being a faithful Platonist as opposed to a faithful interpreter of Scripture and tradition. Plato is indispensable for a genuine and robust understanding of the Great Tradition; so is Thomas. But neither of them (or the teachings of their subsequent inheritors) are simply coextensive with orthodoxy itself. Perhaps terms like Christian Realism, or even (with the proper caveats and clarifications) Christian Transcendentalism or Christian Hellenism, might be more helpful in this regard. The main point is that realism—even the realism required by creedal orthodoxy—is not monolithic or reducible to the teachings of these great figures.\n\n2. Continuities and Discontinuities\n\nBeginning with the background of the development of scholasticism in antiquity and into the medieval period, Barrett provides a strong grounding for his depiction of the positive continuities as scholasticism continued into the Reformation and post-Reformation eras. This is another helpful corrective to much older and confessional scholarship, which underemphasizes the use that the Reformers put to scholastic methods in the construction of their doctrinal work.\n\nThere is a sense in which some of the same methods that characterized medieval scholasticism were put to work by the Reformers and later generations of Protestants to recalibrate Christian teaching. Where it had been customary for medieval theologians to comment first on Lombard’s Sentences and then later on Thomas’ Summa, Protestants were primarily concerned with commenting on Scripture. This shift is significant in that it indicates the priority that Protestants placed on the authority of Scripture relative to that of any human authority (which echoes the concerns stated in the previous section about the significance of authorities including Plato and Aquinas). This is true even for authorities, understood as prophetic or otherwise, in their own time. When Wolfgang Musculus challenged Lutherans in Augsburg with being more radical and incalcitrant than Luther himself, their pithy response was, “Luther is not our Christ.” The same might well be said of other authorities at the time and for different confessions. When put to the test the Reformed at the time surely would likewise have claimed that “Calvin is not our Christ.”\n\nBut if the Protestant Reformation can be understood in some sense as a reboot or restoration of a kind of scholasticism, as Protestant scholasticism developed in relationship both to medieval teaching and to other contemporary traditions, such as the Roman Catholic reformation and second or baroque scholasticism more broadly, new genres and new arguments developed as well. Reformed scholastics engaged in disputations, which was part of the broader academic discourse of the era. But there too was a commentary tradition that developed, not only with respect to Scripture but to the increasingly important confessional documents of the era. A prime exemplar of this is the tradition of commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism, that begins with Zacharius Ursinus and continues in the Reformed tradition into the present day.\n\nBarrett’s study is ambitious, and any single-volume attempt to grapple with developments from Augustine to Calvin and beyond is bound to fall short in all kinds of ways. Specialists will have much to quibble with and criticize, often legitimately, in this volume. As salutary as Barrett’s treatment of scholasticism is more generally, his presentation of the debate over free choice between Luther and Erasmus is perhaps adequate but certainly not compelling. The terminology in the discussion toggles intermittently between “free choice” and more often “free will.” Barrett also relies on shorthand distinctions such as between “monergism” and “synergism,” and the finer details of the debate and its significance are lost in translation as a result.\n\nIt can be difficult to maintain consistency over the course of a thousand pages, and some missteps can certainly be both expected and forgiven. There are lapses into familiar colloquialisms that can grate the sensibilities of the readers. Was Wolfgang Capito really one of the “talking heads” at the Diet of Speyer in 1526? Generally, however, the text is quite readable, moves well, and covers a great deal of intellectual history quite ably and charitably.\n\nGiven Barrett’s goal to provide an accurate self-understanding of the various reform movements, it is worthwhile to note that he accomplishes this without many of the idiosyncrasies that mark some other scholarship. Huldrych Zwingli, for instance, is afforded appropriate attention given the significance of his contribution to the Reformation and is not passed over as “more of a precursor than a founder” of the Reformation. Calvin is placed appropriately within the larger complex of figures in the French, Swiss, German, and English reform movements.\n\nThe focus remains largely on Central and Western Europe, and there is little attention to the important but oft-neglected histories of the Reformation in Poland, Hungary, Scandinavia, and elsewhere. This is regrettable but understandable. One way in which this might have been mitigated would been to place greater attention on the international networks and cross-fertilization that the “Reformation of the refugees” engendered. There is some attention to this, but the Marian exiles, for example, are more or less engaged with as a passing phenomenon than introduced as an important example of international movement and influence. Barrett deals with Heinrich Bullinger in a generally praiseworthy manner, but attention to the role of correspondence as well as migration across the continent would have warranted even more attention for the Zurich reformer. Bullinger occupied a place of prominent influence in Zurich for the better part of the century and had extensive epistolary relationships across the continent. The Reformed were a diverse, international movement with local accents, emphases, and distinctives, and much of this is borne out in the correspondence and controversies of the time. The important connection between the Swiss, particularly Zurich, and the Reformation in England remains a topic worthy of greater attention.\n\n3. Catholicity and Diversity\n\nThere was much substantive diversity between Bullinger and Calvin, for instance, or the theology characteristic of Geneva as distinct from Bern, Strasbourg, and Zurich. Reformed theologians differed on the proper understanding of doctrines including predestination, the covenant, the sacraments, excommunication, and the civil magistrate. The differences between the Lutherans and the Reformed were even more pronounced. And although confessional unity between Lutherans and Reformed was more of an aspiration than a reality, despite efforts such as the Heidelberg Catechism and the Variata of the Augsburg Confession, there was typically no mutual anathematization (Luther’s polemics notwithstanding).\n\nSo even as confessionalization of different Protestant traditions progressed, there remained some sense of underlying unity amidst the diversity of doctrine and opinion. There’s a sense in which the corollary of the catholicity that Barrett so ably narrates in this volume is the diversity that had existed in the church from the time of the patristics to the early modern era. So even while there were attempts to unite around various doctrinal sentiments and confessional documents, and exclude those who did not agree to a particular confessional consensus, there remained a kind of diversity characteristic of the catholicity of the Reformation.\n\nIt is in this sense that the Council of Trent and its anathemas represents a narrowing of the institutional expression of catholicity in the Roman Catholic Church. From one perspective such narrowing is a requirement to maintain orthodoxy. But from another perspective, it is an expulsion of voices and elements that had previously been part of the diverse tapestry of catholic Christianity, which subsequently could only enjoy an invisible, spiritual unity at the expense of institutional restriction.\n\nIt is also true that the diverging ecclesiologies between Protestants and Roman Catholics meant that the Tridentine particularizations of orthodoxy were qualitatively different from all other Protestant confessional expressions. In this way Barrett is certainly correct to draw on the conclusions of Anthony Lane and Konrad Pellikan that Trent represented a schismatic response to the challenge of the Reformers: “Rome, not the Reformers, was the sect that departed from catholic teaching and history.”\n\nIn principle the Protestants could amend, renew, or consign any particular confessional statement to obsolescence. And they have done so often enough in practice. The subsequent history of the Reformation has borne out this truth, as documents such as the Belgic Confession and the Heidelberg Catechism have undergone revision, and influential statements at the time such as the Second Helvetic Confession, have not gained the international significance that other documents have. An international Reformed synod at Dordrecht in 1618-1619 could adopt as confessional standards statements originating from the Palatinate in Germany as well as the Low Countries, even as delegations were invited and welcomed from across Europe, including from Britain, whose representatives included an Anglican bishop.\n\nIt became a practical necessity, to say nothing of a doctrinal requirement, that diversity be respected as a mark of orthodox catholicity. The development of Protestant teaching concerning adiaphora as well as a distinction between the visible and invisible church were both critically important. While being careful to distinguish what Scripture rightly understood both allows and prohibits, the Formula of Concord describes church autonomy:\n\nWe further believe, teach, and confess that the community of God in every place and at every time has the right, authority, and power to change, to reduce, or to increase ceremonies according to its circumstances, as long as it does so without frivolity and offense but in an orderly and appropriate way, as at any time may seem to be most profitable, beneficial, and salutary for good order, Christian discipline, evangelical decorum, and the edification of the church.\n\nA doctrine of permissible or negotiable things allowed for diverse expressions of corporate worship and public piety, even while there were disagreements about what Scripture taught or what was the most faithful understanding of God’s word. And an understanding and affirmation that the body of Christ was not limited to a particular confessional tradition or an institutional expression of the church allowed for an appreciation of the Christian identity of those who disagreed over important, but not essential, doctrines.\n\nSpeaking from the perspective of the Reformed tradition, Herman Bavinck accurately captures this dynamic between catholicity and diversity:\n\nThe Reformed have never been narrow-minded. At Marburg Zwingli far excelled Luther in brotherly love. The Calvinists have never repulsed the Lutherans, but always recognized them as brethren. Calvinism, though laying claim to being the purest religion, and to having most thoroughly purified Christianity of all Romish admixture, has never pretended to be the only true Christian religion. Even in the papal Church it has recognized the religio et ecclesia Christiana. Its broad and mild recognition of baptism shows that it has never denied the catholicity of Christianity. Calvinism is a specific and the richest and most beautiful form of Christianity, but it is not coextensive with Christianity. The Church will not attain to the full unity of faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God until, as the body of Christ, she shall have reached her fullest growth and all members of her body shall be fully developed. Until this time every Church, the Reformed Church included, has to guard what is committed unto it, that the truth may be transmitted pure and intact, and, if possible, still further purified and reformed, to the succeeding generations.\n\nEven as he asserts the superiority of the Reformed tradition, Bavinck is able to acknowledge and affirm that other communions are part of the body of Christ. The church in its full expression is not coextensive with the Reformed confession. This too is an aspect of the prophetic role of the Protestant Reformation, which confesses the body of Christ to be identified with adherence to the teachings of Scripture rightly understood rather than with any particularly institutional manifestation. For as Christ himself taught, the external edifice might remain even while the spiritual reality had departed: “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness” (Matthew 23:27-28).\n\n4. Conclusion: The Old Faith\n\nIn a 1547 translation of a treatise by Heinrich Bullinger, the English Reformer Miles Coverdale described his motivation for pursuing the publication project. Against the charge of novelty, Coverdale writes that he wanted to translate Bullinger’s work “partly, because it sheweth the antiquity and ancient age of our holy Christian faith, and partly, to give occasion unto all such as have received it, not to be ashamed of it, nor to shrink from it, for any opprobrious mockage or scornful derision in this world.”\n\nThe treatise was called, appropriately enough, The Old Faith (Der alt Gloub [1539]), and in it Bullinger sets forth a case for the consistency of the Reformation’s teachings concerning Christ, the gospel, and the church with what has been taught from ancient times. Not content to trace this faith through to the medieval or patristic or even the apostolic eras, Bullinger writes that the Christian faith in substance, if not in name, ought to be considered “backward from Abraham unto the first man, though they had not the name of christian men.” Indeed, this faith goes back to the very creation and foundations of the world, and the same faith in Christ that sustained Adam and Eve, Abraham, and all the patriarchs also gave life to the prophets, the apostles, and the early church.\n\nBullinger concludes with a brief narrative of the decline of the church after the apostolic age, the time in which “through covetousness and ambition, there was poured great poison into the church, whereby religion sore decayed. For while the ministers of the word laboured more after riches, than to perform their office and charge, and to edify the Church, they were pleased with superstitiousness instead of true religion.” What seemed old in Bullinger’s own day was in fact itself new. Following the corruption of the church, “the singleness of faith was forgotten, new laws made, the old rites and customs either perverted, or else utterly overthrown and abused.” Bullinger concludes with a call to renew and restore the church, to “take upon us unfeignedly the true old religion, which has endured since the beginning of the world, by which all holy men have ever loved, worshiped and served God, and knew nothing utterly of the pope’s religion.”\n\nJust as Bullinger’s treatise argues, Barrett’s work in The Reformation as Renewal makes clear that the central debate in the Reformation had to do with the content of the teaching of the Reformers and its faithfulness to Scripture, its coherence with antiquity, and thereby its catholicity. Barrett concludes that “in Luther’s own mind, his call for reform was not a summons to something modern. His vision for renewal was catholic. Debate may persist over the success of that vision, but no debate should exist over its self-professing identity.”\n\nBarrett has done a great service to the church and to his readers in making this self-understanding of the Protestant Reformation clear and comprehensible. Not everyone will find the contentions of the Reformers convincing. But after reading Barrett’s work no reader can claim ignorance of this central, prophetic argument of the Reformation."
