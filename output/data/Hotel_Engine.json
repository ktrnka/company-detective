      "# [35+ Hotel Terms All Business Travel Planners Should Know by Audrey Fairbrother on 2021-09-19](https://www.hotelengine.com/hotel-terms)\nThe travel industry has so many of its own terms and acronyms that it can sound like another language.\n\nIt’s not always easy to understand what they mean, especially if you’re new to the industry or aren’t immersed in the hospitality business.\n\nBut, knowing all of the key hotel terms and acronyms will make it easier to book and manage business travel.\n\nWhether you’re a solo traveler or a corporate travel manager, this knowledge will help you:\n\nUnderstand the terms of your reservation better\n\nInteract with hospitality customer service in a straightforward and knowledgeable manner\n\nHave a better hotel/travel experience in general\n\nSo in this post, we’re going to teach you the terms insiders use in the hospitality industry.\n\nYou’ll be speaking fluent hotel in no time!\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Hotel Terms and Acronyms That Travelers Need to Know\n\n2. Hotel Terms And Acronyms Commonly Used in the Hospitality Industry\n\nHotel Terms and Acronyms for Travel Planners\n\nLet’s start off with some essentials. These are terms that every traveler should get acquainted with.\n\nBoutique Hotel\n\nBoutique hotels offer a more luxurious, stylish, and unique experience for guests. They’re known for being comfortable, quiet, and a step above ‘average’ hotel rooms.\n\nFull Board\n\nFull board means that you can expect not only a hotel room but also breakfast, lunch, and an evening meal with your stay. A bed and breakfast, by contrast, includes only a bed and breakfast.\n\nGroup Rate\n\nA group rate is a lower price sometimes offered or given to groups when several hotel rooms (usually nine or more at a time) are booked at once.\n\nGroup rates help hotels to secure more bookings with large-scale clients, and they help guests by getting them a discount and a better deal on accommodations.\n\nEngine can get you a group rate at hotels all around the world. Learn how our corporate lodging services can save you both time and money!\n\nGuest Room\n\nGuest room is the term used to describe a single hotel room that contains one or more beds. Related terms include double room, which describes hotel accommodations with two rooms, or a suite, which is a larger, multi-room space.\n\nHalf Board\n\nHalf board means that you can expect not only a hotel room but also breakfast and one other meal with your stay.\n\nHotel Chain\n\nHotel chain is the term used to describe similarly branded hotels that operate under the ensign of a particular hotel group. They may be subsidized or franchised, but they must receive approval of some kind before operating a hotel under that particular brand.\n\nDiscover: 5 of the Best Hotel Chains for Business Stays and Events\n\nLocally Negotiated Rate (LNR)\n\nLNR stands for locally negotiated rate, which is an agreement made by the hotel with a local organization or corporate group to provide rooms or meeting spaces at more competitive rates in return for repeat business.\n\nMinimum Length of Stay (MoS)\n\nMoS, which means minimum length of stay, is a stay restriction policy that dictates the absolute minimum number of nights a guest must book a hotel room in order to secure the booking.\n\nNo-Show\n\nA no-show occurs when a guest reserves a room, fails to cancel the booking by the hotel’s cancellation deadline, and never arrives to claim their reservation.\n\nOnline Travel Agency (OTA)\n\nOnline travel agencies are online marketplaces where travelers can research booking information for things like flights, hotel rooms, rental cars, etc. These marketplaces also allow for seamless, instant booking and reservations.\n\nNow, if you need a step above an OTA, and want an easy-to-use booking solution that also provides tools and analytics for your business, Engine has you covered!\n\nRoom Nights\n\nRoom nights is a statistical metric used in the hospitality industry. It represents the total number of rooms a guest commits to occupying in exchange for a specific contracted rate.\n\nSo, if a guest books one room for three nights, they would be said to have generated “three room nights.”\n\nNote that room nights do not necessarily equal the number of people staying at the hotel.\n\nTravel Management Companies (TMC)\n\nA TMC is a travel agency that aids companies in organizing travel processes, policies, plans, and bookings for their teams. They can often secure better rates than would otherwise be possible, thus saving companies time, money, and hassle.\n\nRelated: How to Find the Best Hotel for the Value\n\nIndustry Terms for Hotel and Housing Providers\n\nNow, we’re going to dive into some terms used by professionals in the hospitality industry.\n\nYou may not hear these terms every day, but knowing will help you to understand how hotels structure their deals and think about profits.\n\nThey’re a bit more complicated, but here are some of the most common and important hotel terms used by hospitality pros.\n\nAverage Daily Rate (ADR)\n\nAverage daily rate is a metric used by businesses in the hospitality industry to help them calculate the amount of revenue earned for an occupied room on a given day. It’s actually one of the most important key performance indicators (KPIs) hotels use to track the success of their business.\n\nADR is calculated by dividing the amount of revenue earned by the total number of rooms sold.\n\nAllocation\n\nAllocation is the process of selecting a specific, sometimes limited number of rooms to make available to guests. In some cases, hotel managers may choose to allocate only some rooms, thus leaving some open for later when demand and profits are higher.\n\nAmadeus\n\nAmadeus is the leading computer reservation system (also called a global distribution system) for the travel industry.\n\nAverage Rate Index (ARI)\n\nARI is a metric used by the hospitality industry to measure whether or not they’re achieving a sufficient ADR as compared to other hotels in their demographic or market space.\n\nAverage Room Rate (ARR)\n\nARR is a hospitality industry KPI that helps to evaluate the average rate per available extent. It’s measured by taking the total room income and dividing it by the total rooms engaged.\n\nThis is an essential metric for determining a hotel’s financial success. It’s also sometimes interchangeable with ADR (average daily rate).\n\nBest Available Rate (BAR)\n\nThe BAR is the absolute best, lowest available rate that can be offered for a room at that particular period of time. The purpose of measuring the BAR for a room is to make payment for hotel rooms less confusing.\n\nThe BAR may also fluctuate according to supply and demand and may vary greatly from day to day.\n\nBooking Engine\n\nA booking engine is an online application that hotels use to process online reservations on their websites and social media sites.\n\nEngine can save you time and money on corporate bookings. Learn more about our booking engine today!\n\nChannel Management\n\nChannel management is the process that hotels use to track the business they do through third-party channels. This means managing their connections with:\n\nOnline travel agents\n\nRetail travel agents\n\n​Meta search engines\n\nAggregators\n\nGlobal distribution systems\n\nCompetitive Set\n\nIn the hotel industry, a competitive set (often shortened to “comp set”) is a group of direct competitors that a hotel measures and compares its performance against. Hoteliers use this information to try to make their hotels more competitive in the marketplace.\n\nCentral Reservation System (CRS)\n\nA CRS is a type of reservation system software used to help hotels track inventory, manage guest reservations, and process guest reservations in real time.\n\nDistribution Channels\n\nA hotel distribution channel is any location, either online or offline, where a hotel can sell a room to a customer.\n\nEngine is one example of a distribution channel, as we can facilitate room reservations with over 700,000 different hotels around the world.\n\nTip: When booking travel through a third-party distribution channel, you may find yourself wondering if the website you’re on is a scam. Learn how to spot the signs of fraud in this article: How to Avoid Booking Scams.\n\nGlobal Distribution System (GDS)\n\nGlobal distribution systems serve as a conduit between travel bookers and suppliers.\n\nThese distribution systems provide live information regarding pricing and availability to travel agents and various online booking engines. This helps to facilitate automated transactions.\n\nThe four major legacy GDSs are:\n\nAmadeus\n\nGalileo\n\nSabre\n\nWorldspan\n\nGross Operating Profit Per Available Room (GOPPAR)\n\nGOPPAR is a metric that helps hoteliers to understand how their hotel is performing financially. It compares the hotel’s revenue to its operational performance.\n\nTo figure a hotel’s GOPPAR, divide the gross operating profit by the total number of available rooms.\n\nNet Rate\n\nThe net rate for a hotel room is what a reseller pays for rooms without any commission included.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf a hotel room reseller books a block of hotel rooms at $180 per room at net rate (this means that there’s no commission), and then resells those rooms for $200 per room, the reseller will net $20 per room, and that will be the total revenue.\n\nOccupancy Rate\n\nA hotel’s occupancy rate is the percentage of rooms that are occupied at any given time.\n\nIt’s another key performance indicator, measured by dividing the total number of rooms occupied by the total number of rooms available, then multiplying that number by 100 to create a percentage.\n\nOccupied Room\n\nAn occupied room is a room that a guest has already booked and checked into.\n\nOverbooking\n\nOverbooking is a practice within the hospitality industry in which more rooms are booked out than are available, with that anticipation that a certain number of reservations will be canceled.\n\nHotels overbook to help them ensure that they’ll reach maximum revenue and occupancy.\n\nProperty Management System (PMS)\n\nA PMS is a system that hotels use to manage many of the practical aspects of running a hotel business. It’s the system used for things like:\n\nBooking reservations\n\nGuest check-ins and check-outs\n\nRoom assignment\n\nManaging room rates\n\n​Billing\n\nRack Rate\n\nThe rack rate is the rate a hotel room is assigned before any discounts are applied. This number is usually set artificially high so that discounts will look especially generous and attractive.\n\nRevenue Management System (RMS)\n\nRevenue management systems are software used by hoteliers to analyze things like:\n\nCompetitor rates\n\nHistoric rates\n\nMarket dynamics\n\nInventory levels\n\nThis helps them predict the demand for each room type, allowing them to adjust their rates for maximum profitability and room revenue.\n\nRevenue Per Available Room (RevPAR)\n\nRevPAR is a metric used in the hospitality industry to measure a hotel’s performance.\n\nYou can calculate RevPAR in two different ways.\n\nMultiply the hotel’s average daily room rate by its occupancy rate.\n\nDivide total room revenue by the total number of rooms available in the measured period.\n\nWalk-In (Or Walk-Up) Rate\n\nThe walk-in price for a hotel room is the same as the rack rate. It’s a price figure that’s set artificially high with the expectation that the customer will ask for discounts, use coupons, etc.\n\nYield Management\n\nThis term describes the process of attempting to understand and anticipate customer needs, desires, and behaviors, with the end goal of maximizing revenue and offering better service.\n\nEngine can help you save up to 60% on business lodging at more than 700,000 hotels worldwide.

      "# [The Best Executive Rental Options for Business Travel by Audrey Fairbrother on 2022-01-19](https://www.hotelengine.com/executive-rentals)\nExecutive rentals and corporate housing can be good lodging options for business travelers and traveling teams.\n\nBut here’s the issue:\n\nHow do you find them?\n\nAnd how do you get the best deals without sacrificing quality?\n\nNot all rentals are the same. Avoiding costly pitfalls is just as important as making sure that you book a rental that’ll work well for you and your team.\n\nIn this post, you’re going to learn about the best executive rental sites online.\n\nWe’re also going to give you the 411 on how to stay clear of any potential negative experiences.\n\nIf you’re looking for the best option for finding and securing corporate housing, this is the last guide you’ll ever need.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. What Is an Executive Rental?\n\n2. What to Look for in an Executive Rental\n\n3. Be Careful How You Source Your Rentals\n\n4. How Engine Solves the Executive Rental Problem for Traveling Professionals\n\nWhat Is an Executive Rental?\n\nFor those who may not be completely familiar with the term, executive rentals are basically fully furnished housing options for travelers. They’re typically available to rent for periods of 30 days or longer.\n\nCorporate housing can also fall into the same category. Sometimes, the terms are used interchangeably.\n\nHere are some examples of lodging options that could fall within the executive rental framework:\n\nFurnished condos/condominiums\n\nExtended stay hotels\n\nFurnished apartments\n\nShort-term rental properties\n\nCorporate apartments\n\nLofts\n\nRental units\n\nTemporary housing\n\nVacation rentals\n\nExecutive homes\n\nLuxury rentals\n\nTownhomes\n\nSometimes, executive rentals are run by property management companies who either own or manage vast expanses of real estate properties.\n\nBut sometimes, executive rentals are run by individual homeowners and property owners as investment properties — basically designed to serve as a home away from home for traveling professionals.\n\nBoth of these options have their upsides and downsides. Either way, before you rent an executive rental, you should make sure that it will meet your needs without creating unwanted problems during your stay. ​\n\nWe’re going to cover that in a moment. But first, let’s go over a few other commonly asked questions about executive rentals.\n\nWhat Is Included in an Executive Rental?\n\nGenerally speaking, executive rentals come fully furnished. So, you won’t need to source things like kitchen items, furniture, bedding, linen, etc.\n\nThese rentals mostly come with free parking and may even include amenities like Wi-Fi (though this may also vary by location and property).\n\nHow Do Executive Rentals Work?\n\nExecutive rentals are pretty straightforward in the sense that they serve as a comfortable home that’s rented for at least 30 days at a time.\n\nIf you need to stay for less than a month, an executive rental probably isn’t for you.\n\nBut, a lot of traveling professionals like these types of rentals for longer-term stays because they’re more “homey” than other shorter-term options.\n\nThey bring together the best elements of a “permanent” home while also providing a temporary place to live while the individual is working on location.\n\nNeed help booking accommodations for your team’s next trip? Engine can help you score corporate hotel discounts for big savings.\n\nWhat to Look for in an Executive Rental\n\nFinding high-quality executive rentals can be a challenge.\n\nShort-term rental demands are surging across the United States in a wide range of markets. But this honestly doesn’t come as a surprise.\n\nRemote workers are in high demand. From traveling nurses to people working in tech, energy, and construction fields, there’s certainly no shortage of jobs that require remote workers to fill vital roles.\n\nBut finding a place to live for these traveling professionals can be problematic.\n\n(In fact, it’s getting to a point where trying to do this all on your own can be a logistical nightmare.)\n\nRegardless of whether your job is taking you to San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Arlington, or anywhere in between, finding qualified and service-oriented executive rental providers can be challenging.\n\nAnother challenge is that some professionals (or finance managers/traveling managers) who are new to traveling work aren’t sure what to book for their team.\n\nSometimes, booking such rentals can feel like throwing darts in the dark. You may get on the internet, do a few searches, and end up more confused than you were to start with.\n\nWell, don’t worry — we’re going to help you solve that problem as well.\n\nBut first, we’re going to dig deep into four vital things to look at before choosing an executive rental booking.\n\n1. Convenience\n\nOne of the first things you’ll notice as you start trying to book lodging for your team is that the convenience of your different options will vary wildly across the board.\n\nIn some cases, booking an executive rental will feel relatively painless.\n\nIn other cases, trying to get in touch with someone and secure a booking will feel like pulling teeth.\n\nUnfortunately, this is what happens when companies grow so big that they get bogged down with corporate red tape. It can make it difficult to get in touch with a real person, even for something as important as an executive rental.\n\nOne great rule of thumb is this:\n\nIf the process of trying to secure the rental feels too inconvenient, you may want to pursue a different option.\n\nConvenience matters a lot, especially with an executive rental. Let’s face it; you can’t really afford to be jumping through hoops just to get your team a place to land once they arrive.\n\nPlus, inconvenience during the booking process may also translate to a lack of customer service later on.\n\n2. On-Demand\n\nThis is another issue that can pop up with executive rentals.\n\nSometimes, these rentals can be difficult to secure because they’re in such high demand.\n\nThis is why on-demand housing has become a more talked-about thing in the executive rental arena.\n\nThe idea of on-demand housing is basically this:\n\nBeing able to get housing where you need it, when you need it, on a timeline that works for you.\n\nAs a finance manager or travel manager booking rentals for your team, you know that you just can’t deal with lodging that doesn’t meet your needs.\n\nTherefore, it’s always a better idea to forgo problematic scheduling issues and to stick to executive rental options that actually give you on-demand service.\n\n3. Pricing\n\nSometimes, pricing isn’t as big of an issue as service or convenience.\n\nBut it’s still an issue.\n\nAfter all, small businesses (and large ones, too) need to stick to an employee travel budget.\n\nThis is especially true if you have a set per diem and need to make sure that it’ll cover your team’s living expenses as they travel.\n\nBut simply put, this is what you want:\n\nYou want to find an executive rental option that fits into your budget while also fulfilling your team’s basic housing needs and providing the kind of service they need in order to be successful.\n\nNeed some extra information about per diem? Check out this guide: What Employers Should Know About Per Diem and Employee Rights.\n\n4. Customer Service\n\nCustomer service can vary widely when it comes to executive rentals.\n\nIf you want extra amenities like Wi-Fi, regular fresh linens, washer service, room service, etc., then an extended stay hotel option may be a better bet.\n\nBut if you’re looking more for an actual ‘home away from home,’ like a condo, an apartment, a house, etc., then a short-term rental may be the way to go.\n\nReally, it all comes down to what you want as far as lodging goes.\n\nNow, regardless of what level of service you choose, you’ll also want to make sure that the quality of that service is absolutely top-notch.\n\nThere’s nothing as stressful as not being able to get a hold of customer service in the event of some kind of problem with the rental.\n\nThis is true both for hotels and for short-term rentals.\n\nYou can get a pretty good sense of how customer service will perform by asking some questions and digging deeper into rental details before signing the contract.\n\nDon’t be afraid to ask tougher questions and to insist on speaking with a real person over the phone.\n\nUsing this mindset, it’ll become apparent if this particular executive rental company has what it takes to deliver true high-quality customer service.\n\nBe Careful How You Source Your Rentals\n\nWe’ve heard no shortage of horror stories from travelers who’ve tried to book executive rentals through less trustworthy avenues.\n\nFor example:\n\nWe’ve heard of people using Craigslist for short-term rentals and executive rentals.\n\nAnd with all due respect to Craigslist, traveling professionals would do better not to rely on an online private listing site for an executive rental.\n\nIt’s so important to be careful where you source your housing. There’s no end to how bad things can turn out if you get into a bad unit or something goes wrong with the company.\n\nThis is why we only advocate using services that specialize in business lodging procurement, like Engine.\n\n(And even then, it’s good to learn how to identify scam booking sites.)\n\nNot only does this make things easier, but it also helps you to avoid unwanted and costly business lodging pitfalls.\n\nOn the flip side, Engine can help you to solve your corporate executive rental problems.\n\nLet’s talk about that for a minute.\n\nHow Engine Seeks to Solve the Executive Rental Problem for Traveling Professionals\n\nEngine specializes in hotels for traveling professionals. This could mean salespeople, construction workers, workers in tech and energy fields, traveling nurses, etc.\n\nAnd sometimes, hotel rooms make a suitable alternative to other executive rental options.\n\nEngine basically works like this:\n\nYou sign up for free.\n\nYou gain access to more than 700,000 hotels worldwide.\n\nBook with zero booking fees, no contracts, and no minimums.\n\nEngine will help you to find and secure the types of bookings you actually need.\n\nGet 24/7 customer support.\n\nSave big on business lodging when you book through Engine.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that Engine believes every traveling professional deserves to lay their head somewhere comfortable at the end of the day. That’s why we’re passionate about what we do.\n\nSometimes, a hotel room can be more like an apartment or condo than you might imagine. Plus, you get housekeeping service, free parking, W-Fi, and sometimes even extra amenities — like access to a gym, continental breakfast, a spa, and more.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, there’s everything you need to know about executive rentals, how to find them, how to make sure that you’re renting the right ones, and how to make sure that your team is set for their next work trip.\n\nNow, all that’s left is to get out there and make it happen!\n\nHappy trails — we’ll see you on the open road.\n\n‍",

      "# [The Real Deal on Last Minute Bookings by Sara Kern on 2024-06-06](http://www.hotelengine.com/last-minute-booking/)\nYou may have asked the question before: are hotels cheaper at the last minute?\n\nWhile it’s true that the flexible traveler can sometimes benefit from last-minute hotel booking deals, it’s usually a better option for a personal getaway than for business trips.\n\nHere’s one reason why.\n\nEven if you’re able to plan a business trip meticulously, grabbing up a low-cost last-minute hotel reservation, you could run into unexpected changes.\n\nRemember the chaos of flight cancellations and delays during peak travel times? These disruptions can lead to thousands of sudden changes that travelers need to manage.\n\nTravelers often find themselves stranded, missing important events, or needing to reschedule meetings.\n\nOperational challenges can cause unexpected adjustments to flight routes and schedules.\n\nGrounded aircraft and maintenance issues can result in significant travel disruptions.\n\nMany passengers experience difficulties finding new hotel options due to sudden changes in travel plans.\n\nThese changes represented a lot of time and effort scrambling for new hotel options.\n\nBut that doesn’t have to be you.\n\nWe’ll show you how you can get lower rates and find last-minute hotel deals with the peace of mind that the travelers you manage will have lodging should unexpected travel hiccups arise.\n\n‍\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1.

Due to the high operational costs and desire to maintain occupancy rates, luxury hotels frequently offer significant last-minute discounts to fill their remaining rooms.\n\nWhen booking hotels last minute, especially high-end properties, travelers can secure a better deal compared to booking well in advance. This not only allows for a more lavish stay but also enhances the value of the travel experience without compromising on quality. Engine’s extensive network and exclusive rates ensure that you can even get the best prices on luxury accommodations, even at the last minute!\n\nExclusive Rates Negotiated for You\n\nYou’ll also have access to exclusive rates on all your bookings, including last minute ones. Unlike standard online travel agencies, we negotiate rates directly with hotel chains and locations, so you can save up to 60% without calling hotels to negotiate last-minute deals.\n\nEnjoy the convenience of booking your hotel room at a discounted rate without having to spend time searching for deals from multiple providers or negotiating prices directly with hotel chains.

Not only will you earn HE Rewards on every booking, you can also earn points for loyalty points with 15+ top hotel loyalty programs, including Marriott Bonvoy and Hilton Honors on some rooms — an option usually only available by when you book directly via phone or on a hotel’s website.\n\nThat means you can earn double the rewards on your bookings — which could come in handy when you need a last-minute hotel booking.\n\nRedeem your rewards for rate discounts or even free nights!\n\nExtra Flexibility\n\nWhen you book hotels with Engine, last-minute hotel changes are effortless with added flexible date coverage.\n\nBefore check-in, you can make modifications to your reservation, adding or removing guests, changing your dates, etc. Our Member Support team will take your request to the hotel on your behalf to find you a solution.\n\nFlight delayed, and you won’t make check-in?

When you book with Flex, you can easily cancel your hotel up until noon on the day of check-in and get credited for the cost regardless of the hotel’s cancellation policy.\n\nOr do you need to stay an extra day or more?

However realize that Hotel Engine shops other third party booking sites pricing and actually books through those third party sites. Arriving at the hotel you can ask who the booking is through, I've had Orbitz, travelocity and a couple others. The downside to this is flexibility. If you need to cancel or modify a reservation it's very difficult. I'm going back to Hotels com as my 1st booking choice.",

State of TX has a multi-year contract with Hotel Engine (HE) which makes no sense since it is a new player without a proven record.

For example, I’ve found Staybridge hotel from IHG website for $95 and $90 for government rate. HE charges the same hotel at $99. They’re in the business of reselling at higher markup. Small pocket change but multiplied by thousands of transaction per day equal substantial profit margin. \nHotel Engine is a mediocre platform for hotel reservation. State of TX has a multi-year contract with Hotel Engine (HE) which makes no sense since it is a new player without a proven record. It’s better for State of TX employees to book direct with hotel because at least it gives them more choices. HE search result is very dishonest and misleading. On the mobile app, there is no way to filter out room that is not available on the search result so you end up wasting time clicking through each hotel to find it has room available.

Guests are prepaying them and then this company is booking standard Marriott rates (I can’t imagine how much the guest is paying if this company is actually making a profit)\n\nThey are asking us to run the card they have on file which they say is a virtual card. Normally we need a cc auth or to swipe a card in person except in the cases of entities like Expedia/Booking etc. that have their own rate programs and contracted agreements set up. \n\nThe first time one came through we ran the guests card because we didn’t even notice it was anything different from a standard res. The second time they ended up sending us a credit card authorization, but they didn’t even send it until after the guest checked out. \n\nThey don’t seem to have an extranet or anything set up. This seems so sketchy and like it would be so easily to commit fraud through. \n\nThey are also telling us that we are not to give the folio to the guest, but like I said they are standard rates so I doubt there is a contract in place.\n\n## Comment ID i6895up with +3 score by [(Oop_awwPants, Reddit, 2022-04-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/uc1w4e/hotelengine/i6895up/) (in reply to ID uc1w4e):\nHotel Engine is a corporate booking tool, they're just a bit newer.

Just because you have your hotel membership aligned with hotel engines doesn’t mean you’ll get the points, they skim the points off you if it doesn’t meet their criteria. **per hotel engines customer service: each hotel that meets your criteria in the search will show you if you get points or not. EVEN IF YOU HAVE A MEMBERSHIP WITH THAT CHAIN!**\n\nI got the receipt for the stay from the hotel, it was booked with hotel engines. Hotel engines used Expedia to make the booking. Thereby they’re literally a 4th party service! So the hotel manager says, “yes you stayed, contact the hotel chain customer service for an explanation.”\n\nThe hotel chain customer service says “bc you booked with a 3rd party vendor, you will not be getting points.” \n\nThis despite, like you’re suggesting, linking your hotel accounts with hotel engines. So I’m left to assume hotel engines, as a 4th party, is in kahoots with the 3rd party vendor and stealing peoples points.\n\nAgain I see the strength for flexibility for managers who book. But for the people that actually stay, they get shafted, no points for the stay.\n\nI also want to mention that I got points last time I stayed with the same hotel at the same location but didn’t use hotel engines. So it’s a 3rd, well, 4th party scam. Use it to find rates, then quote the rate to the hotel directly. Under no circumstances would I suggest anyone use it to book rooms unless of course points don’t matter.\n\nI stay close to 140 nights in hotels every year. One of the Bennys being I get to rack the points up for free stays later in my off time. Hotel engines put a quick stop to this perk.\n\n### Comment ID leqzvpw with +1 score by [(daniellie_fonz, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/uc1w4e/hotelengine/leqzvpw/) (in reply to ID l6ypn55):\nu/friendlyfire_88 we have been running into problem after problem with Hotel engine and we agree with you on all points.\n\nQuestion do you have a hotel search engine that you recommend?

      "# Post ID 1alm7k3: I booked via third-party site and later read awful reviews (of the site, not the hotel) with +6 score by [(tunaman808, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/1alm7k3/i_booked_via_thirdparty_site_and_later_read_awful/)\nHello everyone! I'm driving a couple hours to a different city for a concert in May. I originally booked a room via booking.com but wasn't really happy with the price and location. I can cancel this room without penalty 48 hours before arrival.\n\nI decided to see if there was some way to set up a \"price alert\" thing, like camelcamelcamel for hotels, so that if rooms did fall in price I could reserve one that way instead. Most of my research said to use the Google Android app. \n\nWhile setting it up, I stumbled across a great deal for a pre-paid stay for a great price and much better location. So I booked it, as it seemed unlikely that I'd be able to find a better deal on a hotel of this quality in this city. \n\nHowever, afterwards I started looking at reviews for the booking site (not the hotel). The name wasn't familiar to me at all - it's not one of the big ones like Booking or Expedia or Trivago. The reviews were pretty brutal, lots of \"I got there are they couldn't find my reservation\" and \"they said I owed $300 on top of what I was already charged by the booking company\" and \"their 'support' was no help at all!!\" \n\nMy question is: how can I verify that the booking is legit? I obviously thought about calling the hotel directly, but didn't know if I should do that NOW, or wait a bit, or maybe wait until a couple weeks before the show, or... Is there any kind of risk that the hotel would see that I paid about $100 less than their cheapest rate and cancel my reservation?\n\nWhat's the best way to proceed here? And yes, I'll probably book directly at the hotel next time.\n\n## Comment ID kpfr4p9 with +25 score by [(gingybutt, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/1alm7k3/i_booked_via_thirdparty_site_and_later_read_awful/kpfr4p9/) (in reply to ID 1alm7k3):\nFirst off:\nNever book 3rd parties again, ALWAYS book direct.\nSecond:\nCall the hotel NOW and see if they have your reservation. Don't wait any longer. There is no risk, the hotel can't change the rate. However, please anticipate you might not have a reservation\n Usually reviews of scam 3rd party sites are accurate. That's why I say call now so you don't show up day of and your screwed. \nLast:\nIf you decide to book third parties again for some crazy reason, never book away from the big 3. Booking.com, Priceline, and Expedia. There is a lot of 3rd party scam sites out there and I always hate to deliver the bad news of it being a scam.\nSide note:\nLots of big hotel chains do price matches with third parties.. just click the link on the website and fill out the form. Do not call the hotel directly and ask them to match it.\n\nGood luck!\n\n## Comment ID kpg9hcr with +6 score by [(Zip_Silver, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/1alm7k3/i_booked_via_thirdparty_site_and_later_read_awful/kpg9hcr/) (in reply to ID 1alm7k3):\n>how can I verify that the booking is legit?\n\nCall the hotel and ask if they have your reservation.\n\nAlso, if you use a travel agency, just use Booking or Expedia, or one of the sites they own (Priceline/Hotels.com/Hotwire), or a credit card travel agency like Amex or Chase (which use Expedia), everything else is sketch.\n\n### Comment ID kpir4s8 with +4 score by [(HanChan1986, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/1alm7k3/i_booked_via_thirdparty_site_and_later_read_awful/kpir4s8/) (in reply to ID kpg9hcr):\nI wish I could up upvote this 1,000 times!

I would never book with third parties that you never heard of, had this happen to a lot of guests and they had to dispute the charge on their cards. The company wasn't legitimate.

Lufthansa has a travel agency that service a lot of German companies for example. But it would be best to look at utilising a third party agency who issue on their stock. They’ll have a contact team for you in case of any changes/cancellations, but will support implementing an online booking tool for you and your employees to self serve on. You’ll find many companies book travel this way. \n\nSAP Concur is another one you can consider. They’ll refer you to one of their recommended partner agencies to handle the travel side that will complement the expense side. Then there are other agencies that don’t have an expense system that may be well suited to a small business like your’s, and can potentially set you up with a line of credit or something along those lines.\n\n## Comment ID l0arunj with +1 score by [(HIPL_IT_Services, Reddit, 2024-04-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/118f6kt/advice_needed_travel_managers_do_you_have_a/l0arunj/) (in reply to ID 118f6kt):\nAbsolutely, when it comes to business travel management software, TESS360 stands out as my preferred choice.

I booked a hotel stay at the Sheraton through traveluro.com and for some reason the dates they booked for me were not what I entered.  I've contacted them exhaustively and they claim no fault of their own and tell me the booking is non refundable and can't be altered.  Called the hotel they say their hands are tied due to it being booked through a 3rd party and they can't refund or change dates. \n\nObviously the biggest lesson I'm taking away from this is not to book through 3rd parties anymore.  But in the meantime is there anything else I can do to save my $350?

The whole process is automatic so it's unlikely that Holisto (parent company of Traveluro) had any direct involvement with your reservation. From the hotel's perspective, they are correct in saying that their hands are tied in terms of a refund. My advice would be to see if there's any way they could move the date and you pay the difference / a fee such as the commission directly to the hotel? They might not be happy doing this because of the way the hotel receives the money from third parties, though. If it is non-refundable and non-amendable then it is a bit of a pickle that you're in. I think what most likely happened (which I know to have happened before) is guests select a date and the booking engine occasionally defaults to a different date when you go on to the next stage.

There are only a handful that corporate Marriott works with and negotiates for the whole company. That doesn’t stop companies like Traveluro from selling rooms though unfortunately. The reservations will be honored if they are properly communicated to the hotel by Traveluro, but since they are not a travel partner of Marriott, you really have no recourse with Marriott. \n\nNow, I would definitely issue the charge back. Presumably you have emails and such showing you attempted to get a refund and explain the situation. Worst case is that yes, you’re SOL but maybe it’ll work\n\nFor the future, always book with the hotel directly. Besides, with Marriott hotels, they have a best rate guarantee on their website which means you will ALWAYS get the best price booking direct. They are not allowed to offer discounts on Expedia, booking, etc. so at best, you get the same price and extra hassle. If you ever see a lower price from Marriott on a third party site, you can submit a claim (simply form online) to be compensated for the fact that you paid more on Marriotts website. That wouldn’t apply in this case since Traveluro isn’t a Marriott partner and they’re essentially selling stuff they have no authority to sell but just so you know in the future, you have nothing to lose by buying on Marriotts site directly\n\n## Comment ID kg2bnll with +2 score by [(kms1010, Reddit, 2024-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/18wykdu/3rd_party_website_booked_the_wrong_dates_for_my/kg2bnll/) (in reply to ID 18wykdu):\nAs lots of people have said, you might consider contacting your CC company.

This is why before you submit, you need to recheck all of the information, including dates, and amenities, and other arrangements.

You did it you own it and do better next time.\n\n## Comment ID kg74wwx with +1 score by [(Ok-Chemistry9933, Reddit, 2024-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/18wykdu/3rd_party_website_booked_the_wrong_dates_for_my/kg74wwx/) (in reply to ID 18wykdu):\nDispute it with your credit card\n\n## Comment ID kg7563g with +1 score by [(Shoddy-Theory, Reddit, 2024-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/18wykdu/3rd_party_website_booked_the_wrong_dates_for_my/kg7563g/) (in reply to ID 18wykdu):\nWhat does the confirmation that you got at the time of booking say?\n\n## Comment ID kg83wvh with +1 score by [(QuarterCupRice, Reddit, 2024-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/18wykdu/3rd_party_website_booked_the_wrong_dates_for_my/kg83wvh/) (in reply to ID 18wykdu):\nDo you have an email confirmation from traveleruro.com ? What dates are on it? Can you pull up the reservation on their site? What dates does that have? If the dates are the ones you booked and the hotel has the incorrect dates from the 3rd party, that is not your liability.    Dispute the charges on your credit card and provide your supporting documentation.     This type of scenario happened to me.  Fortunately the hotel worked it out for us at the front desk.   \nGood luck.\n\n## Comment ID kg86vz8 with +1 score by [(RDJ1000, Reddit, 2024-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/18wykdu/3rd_party_website_booked_the_wrong_dates_for_my/kg86vz8/) (in reply to ID 18wykdu):\nJust go for the chargeback and hope for the best.\n\n## Comment ID kg8ibhu with +1 score by [(ellepan, Reddit, 2024-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/18wykdu/3rd_party_website_booked_the_wrong_dates_for_my/kg8ibhu/) (in reply to ID 18wykdu):\nWhat were the original dates and what were the incorrectly booked dates?\n\n## Comment ID kg8m6gf with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/18wykdu/3rd_party_website_booked_the_wrong_dates_for_my/kg8m6gf/) (in reply to ID 18wykdu):\nWhen I worked in a hotel, people would book rooms that were occupied or didn't exist via travelocity and other services all the time. I never book through a third party unless in an emergency because I had to turn dozens of people who got screwed by these services and had to watch them fight on the phone with a bunch of garbage customer service.\n\n## Comment ID kgalnbv with +1 score by [(YogurtclosetOk134, Reddit, 2024-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/18wykdu/3rd_party_website_booked_the_wrong_dates_for_my/kgalnbv/) (in reply to ID 18wykdu):\nI think your only recourse is with your credit card company. And if this is a low rated site it will likely be easy to prove they made the error. Have you researched and read any messages from others it happened to? My husband recently had to fight an on line order that was nothing like what we ordered and what description read. The on line retailer would not let us return. He included screen shots of pages of other complaints regarding this on line retailer (lesson learned do more research *before* purchasing). Took almost 6 months of back and forth, pictures, on line reviews and we finally got our $2000 charge reversed and credit card company blocked doing business with this on line retailer as with all the research my husband uncovered this on line retailer is not dealing in good faith.\n\nETA: we travel a lot and stopped booking through 3rd parties 15 years ago. The problems, errors, etc was not worth what typically amounts to very little savings.\n\n## Comment ID kgayooo with +1 score by [(True_Nectarine5875, Reddit, 2024-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/18wykdu/3rd_party_website_booked_the_wrong_dates_for_my/kgayooo/) (in reply to ID 18wykdu):\nPretty crazy how I came here asking for advice after being fucked over by a computer glitch and all everyone here wants to do is tell me computers never glitch and downvote me.

However realize that Hotel Engine shops other third party booking sites pricing and actually books through those third party sites. Arriving at the hotel you can ask who the booking is through, I've had Orbitz, travelocity and a couple others. The downside to this is flexibility. If you need to cancel or modify a reservation it's very difficult. I'm going back to Hotels com as my 1st booking choice.",

They’re in the business of reselling at higher markup. Small pocket change but multiplied by thousands of transaction per day equal substantial profit margin. \nHotel Engine is a mediocre platform for hotel reservation. State of TX has a multi-year contract with Hotel Engine (HE) which makes no sense since it is a new player without a proven record. It’s better for State of TX employees to book direct with hotel because at least it gives them more choices. HE search result is very dishonest and misleading. On the mobile app, there is no way to filter out room that is not available on the search result so you end up wasting time clicking through each hotel to find it has room available. Prices are often higher than direct booking. I would not recommend this app to anyone unless you don’t have any other option.",

They have (sort of) a rewards program that can be used for rooms.  Prices are decent but not great\n\nBad - Hotel Engine uses Priceline as their booking engine.  That means decent rates but no hotel rewards at all. That means everyone in my company loses their elite hotel status which gives us all sorts of perks (no upgraded rooms, no upgraded internet, no free meals, the list goes on). \n\nIn summary, I’m begging my company to move away from this system after using them for less than a month.

The new booking options will go live in October, making Hotel Engine an all-in-one solution for business travel.\n\nAlongside the new product release, Hotel Engine will change its name to \"Engine\" to reflect its expanded focus.\n\n“Hotel bookings will always be in our DNA, but we’re out to transform the entire travel experience,” said Hotel Engine CEO Elia Wallen. “We want to become the engine of business travel. Our new name will reflect that, and with Permira’s latest investment, we’ll be better positioned than ever to turn our ambitions into reality.”\n\nDenver-based Hotel Engine has quickly become a go-to option for business travelers thanks to its industry-leading tech and innovative features like consolidated invoices, coverage for incidentals, 24/7 customer support, whole-company trip insurance and free travel-management software to help customers save time and money.

Hotel Engine has used only $20M of outside capital to reach its current $2.1B valuation, up from $1.3B at its Series B in November of 2021. The company is profitable, experiencing 70% year-over-year revenue growth at scale, and is on track to book over 10 million room nights this year.\n\nPermira Principal Alex Melamud has joined Hotel Engine’s Board of Directors.\n\n“Hotel Engine is a category leader in more ways than one,” he said. “They’ve figured out how to provide the benefits of managed travel without the downsides such as contracts, minimum spend requirements and extra support fees, and they’ve also created a business that appeals to both travelers and suppliers like hotels, airlines and car rental companies. We are confident that Hotel Engine has miles of room to run, and we’re excited to be part of the journey alongside Elia and his team,” commented Melamud.\n\nAbout Hotel Engine\n\nHotel Engine, soon to be “Engine,” is radically simplifying business travel by providing software that saves companies time and money without the hassle of contracts, agent-assist fees or minimum spends.

Adding flights and car rentals to its renowned hotel booking services, this transformation positions Engine as the most logical choice for companies that don’t want to overspend on business travel, or drain resources managing it.\n\nEngine allows you to book with nearly every hotel in the world, and with all major airlines and car rental companies. It offers the flexibility to modify or cancel trips at any time without sunk costs, and delivers a unified view of all company travel, trends and spend. Customers can identify savings opportunities quickly and consistently via analytics served up on the platform.\n\n“Hotel Engine became the leading platform to book and manage hotels for business travel. Now, as Engine, we’re modernizing business travel at scale. With the addition of flights and cars, we’re an all-in-one platform that adds value for the whole company — from travelers to accounting teams,” said Engine CEO and Founder Elia Wallen. “With Flex and FlexPro, we offer the most flexibility for changes and cancellations. With our convenient payment program, Direct Bill, we cover your company’s travel costs upfront and send a single consolidated invoice, which has saved accounting teams hundreds of hours per year.”\n\nEngine is easy to adopt - it doesn’t have any membership fees, agent-assist fees or require a contract to use. Travelers benefit from its extensive network, free 24/7 access to award-winning Member Support, convenient features and robust loyalty program. In addition to earning loyalty points at preferred hotels, airlines, and car rental brands, members earn Engine Rewards, which can be redeemed for free travel.\n\n“We also make booking for groups and events easy. Engine Groups is the most effective way to browse properties, compare rates and book hotels for large groups, with white glove service at every step,” Wallen added. “This service is for any group trip with 9+ rooms or extended stays. Our platform identifies the best accommodation options and our Groups team negotiates with the hotel directly on the details.”\n\nSign up for an account and discover the smarter way to book and manage work trips: www.engine.com/sign-up.\n\n‍",

      "# [Hotel Engine Rebrands as Engine with Engine.com by Elliot Silver on 2024-09-17](https://domaininvesting.com/hotel-engine-rebrands-as-engine-with-engine-com/)\nIn June, with the help of DomainTools, I noticed that the Engine.com domain name was pending transfer and the nameservers had recently changed to Cloudflare. This valuable domain name transferred to Cloudflare, where it is currently registered under Whois privacy.\n\nWe now know who acquired Engine.com.\n\nAccording to an article in Fortune today, Hotel Engine is rebranding itself as Engine. The Engine.com domain name now forwards to HotelEngine.com. I suspect that will reverse when the company fully rebrands in October.\n\nThe reason for the rebrand seems pretty simple – Hotel Engine as a brand was too limiting. People only expected to book hotel rooms on Hotel Engine. Rebranding as Engine while acquiring the generic Engine.com domain name allows the company to offer additional travel services without confusion. This is outlined in a FAQ on the splash page visitors to Engine.com land on:\n\n“When we started this journey, we focused on revolutionizing hotel bookings for businesses. But our customers asked for more, and we listened. Our evolution into Engine marks our expansion into full-service business travel solutions for our customers. With the addition of flights and cars, our customers can manage all their business travel on a single platform.“\n\nPrior to the transfer to Cloudflare, Engine.com had been registered under Whois privacy at GoDaddy. Prior to that, the domain name was owned by a domain investor I have known for many years. I will reach out to him to see if he was the seller, and if so, if he can comment on the sale price.\n\nRight now, I have no idea what the company paid to acquire the Engine.com domain name. I would not be surprised if it was well into the 7 figures (or more). I think it is similar in nature to the recent sale of Rocket.com.\n\nPerhaps the sale price will be announced one day. Until then, kudos to the team behind this great rebrand. The company is now reportedly valued at $2.1 billion.",
