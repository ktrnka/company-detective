Hotel Engine primarily serves small- to mid-sized companies in the U.S., operating in a B2B model. The platform is designed to simplify trip management for businesses and their traveling employees, providing features such as consolidated invoices, 24/7 customer support, and whole-company trip insurance [(Hotel Engine, 2024)](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/17/2947398/0/en/Hotel-Engine-Achieves-2-1B-Valuation-With-140M-Permira-Investment.html).\n\nThe company has reported a 70% year-over-year revenue growth and is on track to book over 10 million room nights in 2024. It has utilized only $20 million of outside capital to reach its current valuation of $2.1 billion, indicating a strong financial position and profitability [(Skift, 2024)](https://skift.com/2024/10/03/hotel-engine-ceo-talks-growth-after-140-million-fundraise/).

This expansion reflects the company's ambition to transform the entire travel experience, as stated by CEO Elia Wallen [(PhocusWire, 2024)](https://www.phocuswire.com/hotel-engine-series-c-growth).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nElia Wallen is the CEO and founder of Hotel Engine. He transitioned to focus on the company full-time in February 2020, after its initial success as a subsidiary of Travelers Haven. Wallen has been pivotal in the company's growth and strategic vision, emphasizing the company's cash flow positive status and potential for future mergers and acquisitions [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-hotel-engine-reaches-2-111425206.html).

The company faces competition from other travel management platforms like Navan and TravelPerk but sees ample opportunity for multiple players to succeed in this large market [(Skift, 2024)](https://skift.com/2024/10/03/hotel-engine-ceo-talks-growth-after-140-million-fundraise/).\n\n# Additional Reading\n\n- [Hotel Engine: Corporate Lodging Solutions](https://www.hotelengine.com/)\n- [Business Travel Insights](https://www.hotelengine.com/library)\n- [Help Revolutionize Business Travel](https://www.hotelengine.com/culture)\n- [Business Travel Lodging Software](https://www.hotelengine.com/faqs)\n- [Discounted Group Rates](https://www.hotelengine.com/groups)\n- [Hotel Engine Pricing Plans](https://www.hotelengine.com/pricing)\n- [Corporate Lodging Hotels](https://www.hotelengine.com/contact-us)\n- [Privacy Policy](https://www.hotelengine.com/privacy-policy)\n- [Corporate Lodging Company](https://www.hotelengine.com/about-us)\n\nHotel Engine is poised for significant growth with its recent funding, upcoming product expansions, and strategic rebranding.

Whether you need to adjust your travel dates, add special accommodations, or explore alternative hotel options, we're here to help.\n\nPayment and Billing Questions: If you have questions or concerns about your billing statement, payment methods, or charges related to your hotel reservation, our team can provide clarification and assistance to resolve any issues promptly.\n\nReservation Management: Our team ensures that your reservations are accurate and up-to-date, from troubleshooting issues with reservation confirmations to addressing discrepancies between booking details and hotel accommodations.\n\nTravel Assistance: Whether you encounter difficulties during check-in, require assistance with special requests or preferences at the hotel, or encounter unexpected travel disruptions, our team is available to provide guidance and support to help resolve any issues you may encounter during your trip.\n\nRefunds and Cancellations: If you need to cancel a reservation and request a refund, our team can assist with understanding our refund policy, initiating refund requests, and addressing any concerns or questions you may have throughout the process.\n\nGeneral Inquiries and Support: Our Member Support team is also available to assist with any other inquiries, concerns, or feedback you may have about our platform, services, or your overall experience with Hotel Engine. We strive to provide excellent customer service and ensure that all of your needs are met efficiently and effectively.\n\nBy providing great value to our hotel partners, we get great rates. That means we can take a small cut of each booking â enough to cover 24/7 Member Support and continually re-invest in new technology â and still offer deals to our members that are up to 60% less than the online public travel sites. Thatâs why we can keep Hotel Engine free to join and use.\n\nâ\n\nNo membership fees, no contracts, and no minimum spend.\n\nWe want our members to have plenty of options when booking lodging. Our platform currently offers 750,000+ properties worldwide.\n\nâ\n\nYou'll find just about every hotel in the U.S. on our platform. If you don't see a specific hotel when you search, it's likely because the hotel is fully booked during your dates. In those rare cases, we'll show you nearby comparable properties with availability during your travel dates.\n\nâ\n\nWeâre in the business of radically simplifying trip management for everyone, and we believe great hotel rates should be accessible to everyone, too.\n\nâ\n\nThatâs why Hotel Engine is free to join and use â no membership fees, no contracts, no minimum required spend, no catch.\n\nâ\n\nâClick here to learn more about our pricing.\n\nIndividual hotel properties set their own cancellation policies, which are clearly displayed during the booking process (youâll see whether the room is refundable, and the last date you can cancel and receive your money back). After booking, you can find cancellation policy information in the âImportant Informationâ section of your confirmation page.\n\nâ\n\nIf you need to keep travel plans flexible, there are two great options available.\n\nâ\n\nYou can select the Flex option during the booking process. Flex allows you to cancel any reservation up until noon the day of arrival or cut a trip short mid-stay and get refunded â regardless of the hotelâs cancellation policy.\n\nIf your company signs up for FlexPro, every traveler is fully covered with our highest degree of flexibility. With an annual plan, FlexPro costs $2,000 ($167/mo) covering everyone in your company. If you want to go month-to-month, Flexpro costs $200 - again, covering everyone in your company.\n\nâ\n\nâ",

For example, I’ve found Staybridge hotel from IHG website for $95 and $90 for government rate. HE charges the same hotel at $99. They’re in the business of reselling at higher markup. Small pocket change but multiplied by thousands of transaction per day equal substantial profit margin. \nHotel Engine is a mediocre platform for hotel reservation. State of TX has a multi-year contract with Hotel Engine (HE) which makes no sense since it is a new player without a proven record. It’s better for State of TX employees to book direct with hotel because at least it gives them more choices. HE search result is very dishonest and misleading. On the mobile app, there is no way to filter out room that is not available on the search result so you end up wasting time clicking through each hotel to find it has room available.

However realize that Hotel Engine shops other third party booking sites pricing and actually books through those third party sites. Arriving at the hotel you can ask who the booking is through, I've had Orbitz, travelocity and a couple others. The downside to this is flexibility. If you need to cancel or modify a reservation it's very difficult. I'm going back to Hotels com as my 1st booking choice.",

After a couple of weeks, the trip plan changed by one day so called customer service to cancel one day on both rooms. \nUpon arriving at the hotel, they moved one room and hotel canceled the other due to a “no show” and hotel engine’s cc didn’t work. We called customer service again and they said they’d call right back. No fun sitting in hotel lobby for three hours and several attempts to contact HE was a dismal failure.

      "# Higher prices than booking direct, no price match, 2 stars [(wingchunfan, Apple App Store, 2020-10-15)](https://apple/6538819685)\nHotel Engine does not do price match. For example, I’ve found Staybridge hotel from IHG website for $95 and $90 for government rate. HE charges the same hotel at $99. They’re in the business of reselling at higher markup. Small pocket change but multiplied by thousands of transaction per day equal substantial profit margin. \nHotel Engine is a mediocre platform for hotel reservation. State of TX has a multi-year contract with Hotel Engine (HE) which makes no sense since it is a new player without a proven record. It’s better for State of TX employees to book direct with hotel because at least it gives them more choices. HE search result is very dishonest and misleading. On the mobile app, there is no way to filter out room that is not available on the search result so you end up wasting time clicking through each hotel to find it has room available. Prices are often higher than direct booking. I would not recommend this app to anyone unless you don’t have any other option.",

They have pretty good deals and are competitive with the other companies out there in terms of pricing but was not my first choice cause I like to get points for my stays.  I try to book only Hilton family hotels so I can accumulate points and earn some free nights for vacations with the fam.  \n\nTo my surprise, Hotel Engine now allows you to use your loyalty number while booking!!! \n\nFor real this is a total game changer for me! Also they upgraded their mobile app and is now a million times better than the old one!! It seems Hotel Engine has listened to their users and delivered which can be pretty rare these days when dealing with these bigger companies!!!

They have (sort of) a rewards program that can be used for rooms.  Prices are decent but not great\n\nBad - Hotel Engine uses Priceline as their booking engine.

That means everyone in my company loses their elite hotel status which gives us all sorts of perks (no upgraded rooms, no upgraded internet, no free meals, the list goes on). \n\nIn summary, I’m begging my company to move away from this system after using them for less than a month.

Guests are prepaying them and then this company is booking standard Marriott rates (I can’t imagine how much the guest is paying if this company is actually making a profit)\n\nThey are asking us to run the card they have on file which they say is a virtual card. Normally we need a cc auth or to swipe a card in person except in the cases of entities like Expedia/Booking etc. that have their own rate programs and contracted agreements set up. \n\nThe first time one came through we ran the guests card because we didn’t even notice it was anything different from a standard res. The second time they ended up sending us a credit card authorization, but they didn’t even send it until after the guest checked out. \n\nThey don’t seem to have an extranet or anything set up. This seems so sketchy and like it would be so easily to commit fraud through. \n\nThey are also telling us that we are not to give the folio to the guest, but like I said they are standard rates so I doubt there is a contract in place.\n\n## Comment ID i6895up with +3 score by [(Oop_awwPants, Reddit, 2022-04-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/uc1w4e/hotelengine/i6895up/) (in reply to ID uc1w4e):\nHotel Engine is a corporate booking tool, they're just a bit newer.

Just because you have your hotel membership aligned with hotel engines doesn’t mean you’ll get the points, they skim the points off you if it doesn’t meet their criteria. **per hotel engines customer service: each hotel that meets your criteria in the search will show you if you get points or not. EVEN IF YOU HAVE A MEMBERSHIP WITH THAT CHAIN!**\n\nI got the receipt for the stay from the hotel, it was booked with hotel engines. Hotel engines used Expedia to make the booking. Thereby they’re literally a 4th party service! So the hotel manager says, “yes you stayed, contact the hotel chain customer service for an explanation.”\n\nThe hotel chain customer service says “bc you booked with a 3rd party vendor, you will not be getting points.” \n\nThis despite, like you’re suggesting, linking your hotel accounts with hotel engines. So I’m left to assume hotel engines, as a 4th party, is in kahoots with the 3rd party vendor and stealing peoples points.\n\nAgain I see the strength for flexibility for managers who book. But for the people that actually stay, they get shafted, no points for the stay.\n\nI also want to mention that I got points last time I stayed with the same hotel at the same location but didn’t use hotel engines. So it’s a 3rd, well, 4th party scam. Use it to find rates, then quote the rate to the hotel directly. Under no circumstances would I suggest anyone use it to book rooms unless of course points don’t matter.\n\nI stay close to 140 nights in hotels every year. One of the Bennys being I get to rack the points up for free stays later in my off time.

      "# Post ID 1alm7k3: I booked via third-party site and later read awful reviews (of the site, not the hotel) with +6 score by [(tunaman808, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/1alm7k3/i_booked_via_thirdparty_site_and_later_read_awful/)\nHello everyone! I'm driving a couple hours to a different city for a concert in May. I originally booked a room via booking.com but wasn't really happy with the price and location. I can cancel this room without penalty 48 hours before arrival.\n\nI decided to see if there was some way to set up a \"price alert\" thing, like camelcamelcamel for hotels, so that if rooms did fall in price I could reserve one that way instead. Most of my research said to use the Google Android app. \n\nWhile setting it up, I stumbled across a great deal for a pre-paid stay for a great price and much better location. So I booked it, as it seemed unlikely that I'd be able to find a better deal on a hotel of this quality in this city. \n\nHowever, afterwards I started looking at reviews for the booking site (not the hotel). The name wasn't familiar to me at all - it's not one of the big ones like Booking or Expedia or Trivago. The reviews were pretty brutal, lots of \"I got there are they couldn't find my reservation\" and \"they said I owed $300 on top of what I was already charged by the booking company\" and \"their 'support' was no help at all!!\" \n\nMy question is: how can I verify that the booking is legit? I obviously thought about calling the hotel directly, but didn't know if I should do that NOW, or wait a bit, or maybe wait until a couple weeks before the show, or... Is there any kind of risk that the hotel would see that I paid about $100 less than their cheapest rate and cancel my reservation?\n\nWhat's the best way to proceed here? And yes, I'll probably book directly at the hotel next time.\n\n## Comment ID kpfr4p9 with +25 score by [(gingybutt, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/1alm7k3/i_booked_via_thirdparty_site_and_later_read_awful/kpfr4p9/) (in reply to ID 1alm7k3):\nFirst off:\nNever book 3rd parties again, ALWAYS book direct.\nSecond:\nCall the hotel NOW and see if they have your reservation. Don't wait any longer. There is no risk, the hotel can't change the rate. However, please anticipate you might not have a reservation\n Usually reviews of scam 3rd party sites are accurate. That's why I say call now so you don't show up day of and your screwed. \nLast:\nIf you decide to book third parties again for some crazy reason, never book away from the big 3. Booking.com, Priceline, and Expedia. There is a lot of 3rd party scam sites out there and I always hate to deliver the bad news of it being a scam.\nSide note:\nLots of big hotel chains do price matches with third parties.. just click the link on the website and fill out the form. Do not call the hotel directly and ask them to match it.\n\nGood luck!\n\n## Comment ID kpg9hcr with +6 score by [(Zip_Silver, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/1alm7k3/i_booked_via_thirdparty_site_and_later_read_awful/kpg9hcr/) (in reply to ID 1alm7k3):\n>how can I verify that the booking is legit?\n\nCall the hotel and ask if they have your reservation.\n\nAlso, if you use a travel agency, just use Booking or Expedia, or one of the sites they own (Priceline/Hotels.com/Hotwire), or a credit card travel agency like Amex or Chase (which use Expedia), everything else is sketch.\n\n### Comment ID kpir4s8 with +6 score by [(HanChan1986, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/1alm7k3/i_booked_via_thirdparty_site_and_later_read_awful/kpir4s8/) (in reply to ID kpg9hcr):\nI wish I could up upvote this 1,000 times!

Currently, we're using Melon (partner of Corporate Traveler), but it's leaving us a bit sour. The search function is as slow as a snail, the interface feels clunky, and don't even get me started on the reporting!\n\nHas anyone here tried Navan for booking travel? I'm intrigued by its sleek interface, the ease of setting up approvals, and its ability to handle group travel. We are a small office of 40 people, but we travel accross Europe, Asia, and Latam, racking up a hefty annual travel spend of nearly 2 million.\n\nI'm all ears for your thoughts, the good, the bad, and the unexpected if we decide to make the switch! Thanks, you amazing bunch!\n\n## Comment ID kxwvq9g with +13 score by [(nancy_drew_98, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1bv1gji/navan_travel_software_thoughts_and_opinions/kxwvq9g/) (in reply to ID 1bv1gji):\nOh, OP, I'm so glad you asked - do NOT use Navan.    \n  \nHere is a basic breakdown of how they work: Navan books your travel using third-party aggregators like booking.com or hotels.com.  So when something goes wrong - and it will - Navan will then tell you to reach out to the aggregator.  The aggregator, however, is going to tell you that you need to either contact Navan or the hotel/airline/car rental service directly.  You'll spend hours if not days begging for someone, anyone, to help you resolve the issue.  This happened to us more than once.\n\nEven with minor issues, Navan's customer service is abysmal.  As part of our contract, we were supposed to have a dedicated customer service manager who could assist with any issue.  Every time I emailed him, his response was (literally, no joke) \"okay, but did you try the chat function for help?\"  He was of absolutely no assistance, and the chat service agents are tier 1 support with no authority or empowerment to actually provide any assistance.  It was beyond frustrating.  \n\nTheir parameters for what qualifies as \"group travel\" are almost useless - if you're a smaller organisation it might not be too bad, but I think when my company was using them their \"group travel\" was for over ten people but fewer than 25 which was of no assistance to me because I plan internal events with 50-100 people.\n\nIn a nutshell: keep looking.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but hopefully my extremely poor experiences with them will serve a purpose here.\n\n### Comment ID kxxmp9t with +4 score by [(Princessladybug17, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1bv1gji/navan_travel_software_thoughts_and_opinions/kxxmp9t/) (in reply to ID kxwvq9g):\nCame here to share this exactly! Extra plus 1 on the customer service.\n\nTheir invoicing is also terrible. When you change a flight/hotel if there is a change fee you can’t get an invoice for that exact amount, only a new invoice with the total price and no notes on the change fee. This is obviously a problem if you’re expensing flights/hotels and fees for a business. When I’ve brought it up in the past they’ve gotten me to open a ticket with their finance department directly which can take days to hear back from.\n\nI wish I had a better alternative for you, but good luck!\n\n### Comment ID kxwwgk0 with +4 score by [(sanfranbran, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1bv1gji/navan_travel_software_thoughts_and_opinions/kxwwgk0/) (in reply to ID kxwvq9g):\nThank you!

I've found that trying to book flights on different airlines is difficult. AND that you \\*have\\* to choose a departure flight before you can choose a return flight. I often do a google flights search for the flights that work best for my exec and then HOPE I can choose those flights on Navan. Hotel room prices are all over the place due to the aggregators, so you have to be sure you're getting the best refundable price (per our policy), which is usually a bit more than just going direct to the hotel. \n\nThis week alone I've had to cancel and then rebook black cars, because neither the car company nor Navan could just change the pick up and drop off locations. Same dates, etc. but new pick up time/location. Dumb. \n\nMy biggest pet peeve, though, is that there is nowhere to add a \"note\" to the reservations. I've asked our administrator to look into adding a \"notes\" box or something, but Navan said it's not possible. I'd love to be able to add a note to my exec about his trip. Like if I have to book his seat via the airline website, because Navan won't let me choose one, there should be a place I can put note to let him know where he's sitting. It's frustrating. Concur had a notes section. It was very helpful.\n\nNavan is also our expense report app, so all of us have Navan cards/virtual cards for booking, purchasing meals, etc. It's super clunky to add receipts. It's just not a great app.\n\n## Comment ID kxyf1i6 with +3 score by [(AC1130, Reddit, 2024-04-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1bv1gji/navan_travel_software_thoughts_and_opinions/kxyf1i6/) (in reply to ID 1bv1gji):\nSince Navan seems to suck (no personal experience w/ them), check out Gant Travel.

They’ve told me things that were 100% wrong and cost us time, when I let them know they were wrong, they blamed others/shifted the blame. \n\nOverall, it’s a headache if you ever need to make changes.

For full transparency I am a customer service manager with Navan (started as a consultant in 2018 when we were TripActions).\n\nFlights\nNavan searches flights from multiple sources, including multiple GDS’s, NDC, and TravelFusion (a low cost carrier portal). This allows us to present THE most robust content of any TMC globally. \n\nHotels\nYes, we source from aggregators, but we also source direct from the property (GDS) to offer the most robust rate selection based on a traveler’s preferences and priorities and the booking source is clearly shown along with each rate (direct rate, booking.com, hotels.com, etc.) Navan is probably the most transparent when it comes to hotel content. Additionally for third-party bookings, users are NEVER referred to the aggregator EXCEPT for Agoda bookings and this is due to their ridiculous, unnecessary policy of only speaking with the guest even if the booking originated with an agency . Agoda is a Priceline brand  and we have actively been working with them to try to find a solution. Also, per our third-party agreements, we are required to abide by the rate rules. This means we cannot ask for refunds for non-refundable bookings. Note that this applies to third-party (aggregator) bookings. But the majority of our properties and rates are hotel-direct rates which are booked via a GDS (legacy travel agent system.)\n\nCars\nCars are booked via GDS. Not much to say.\n\nRail\nWe currently offer full content with Amtrak, UK Rail suppliers, SNCF, RENFE, SNCB, NS, DB, OBB, SBB, and TrenItalia.\n\n### Comment ID ldkaomv with +1 score by [(Successful-Jacket856, Reddit, 2024-07-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1bv1gji/navan_travel_software_thoughts_and_opinions/ldkaomv/) (in reply to ID l8pq2ex):\nHey I know you wrote this comment a little while ago but I've been looking at Navan myself and came across this thread.

He saw there was an extra $600 charge in his bank account, for a 1-way ticket to TX. He went to the Navan app but it  wasn't very intuitive on terms of helping him gather any details of what could've happened. The extra charge on his bank account showed as SW Airline, not Navan (unlike the other correct charges; labeled as Navan.) The airline told him Navan purchased two 1-way tickets to TX. 2.5 weeks ago he requested a refund from Navan. They said he'd have to reach out to the airline, and it would take 5-10 biz says for the airline to send the refund to Navan. He waited 1 week & assumed *his* refund process would be automatic, waiting for them to issue it. He reached back out, they had his money, yaaaay. But I guess he had to verbally tell them \"ok you can gimme my $ now please\". So then they said bet, give us 3-5 biz days and it'll be in your bank account. \n\n\nMy poor guy. He's a marine, and he's also a Sales Dev Rep. He's always going above & beyond to make the schedule timing & financial planning of each job work with the other.

      "# Post ID 125xllt: New to booking hotels for my staff and constantly getting fees/entire bookings charged to the guest's card. Am I doing hotels wrong?! with +9 score by [(peanutismint, Reddit, 2023-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/)\nI've been a travelling freelance contractor for many years staying in hotels all over the world so I thought I knew how the process worked - usually my clients would include me in their room block and upon check-in I'd be asked to provide my personal credit card for incidentals but the cost of the booking would already be taken care of. Sure there were one or two times where a mixup meant I was forced to put down my own credit card to pay for the rooms, but that was the exception (in my experience).\n\nRecently, though, I started a new role booking hotel rooms for my company's freelance staff, and it's been a major pain point. It seems that even when our travel agent books a room on behalf of our staff member and supplies our corporate account details for payment, OR when I 'manually' book a last minute hotel room myself using my company card but adding the guest's name to the room booking, my freelance staff are still ending up being charged on their personal cards for their room booking fees/resort fees/taxes etc.\n\nThis is particularly irking to me as an ex-freelancer as I don't ever expect my staff to pay for their own rooms, even if they will be reimbursed. It's simply not fair to expect someone to pay from their own personal funds in order to work, and not everybody is priveleged enough to have money in their bank account or a credit card to cover these $500-per-night hotels that some of our clients hold events at.\n\nAm I doing hotel booking wrong? This even seems to happen when I fill out those 'pre-authorisation' forms to try to ensure our company card is billed but then on check-in they STILL ask my staff to provide a card for a deposit or what have you, and wouldn't you know it 9 times out of 10 that's the card they end up charging, making a huge headache for us and our accounts team when it comes time to reimburse our staff.\n\nThankfully as yet nobody has been unable to check in due to lack of personal funds, but I shudder to think of any of my staff maxing out their credit cards/not being able to eat or what have you because the hotel forced them to provide their own card for payment or they wouldn't be allowed to stay.\n\n**TL;DR:** How can I make sure hotels never charge my freelance workers for their stays and ONLY charge our corporate credit card with which we pre-booked (and in some cases pre-paid) for their room?\n\n## Comment ID je6jfpi with +27 score by [(jeswesky, Reddit, 2023-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/je6jfpi/) (in reply to ID 125xllt):\nI do all the travel booking for my company and I used to work front desk at hotels.  Yes, you are doing it wrong.\n\nIf you want to cover the cost of the hotel, you have a couple of options.\n\n1. Contact the hotel and request a credit card authorization form.  Complete the form and return to them.  This will allow the hotel to charge either the room/tax or all charges to the credit card on file, depending on which you indicate on the form.  \n2. If you regularly book at specific hotels, reach out to their sales department and ask to set up a direct bill account.  When booking, make sure to indicate that this is a direct bill for room/tax or all charges to the preset account.\n\n## Comment ID je6isbq with +9 score by [(pocketpocket, Reddit, 2023-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/je6isbq/) (in reply to ID 125xllt):\nIf you're always booking the same property reach out and ask to speak to their corporate sales manager - you can try to arrange a negotiated rate and maybe direct billing (if they approve it).  \n\nOtherwise, when you book a room for someone, phone the property and ask for a credit card authorization form. Many hotels will not charge your card without additional proof of legitimacy (so as to avoid fraudulent transactions and charge backs).

Credit card authorization forms grant you the most flexibility and if you fill it out for all charges the guest won’t need to provide a card at all. \n\nThis isn’t a foolproof method, because human error on your end as well as on the hotel’s end is a thing, but imo it’s the most surefire way to ensure you have the flexibility to cancel when plans change (a definite drawback to option 1), as well as determine how much of the stay you’re covering (a potential drawback to option 3)\n\n#### Comment ID je7bknv with +3 score by [(peanutismint, Reddit, 2023-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/je7bknv/) (in reply to ID je6iqvg):\nThanks for the tips guys.

Not only will it make future bookings more seamless but once you reach a certain number of room nights per your you can get group rates even for individual rooms.\n\nAt the company I worked for we had both corporate sales and property sales and the international clients that were frequently booking rooms at various properties went through corporate who then passed everything to the property.\n\n## Comment ID je821ge with +2 score by [(SkwrlTail, Reddit, 2023-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/je821ge/) (in reply to ID 125xllt):\nOne thing to remember about hotels is that they'll often be running an 'Authorization Hold' on a card. If your employees are using a Debit card, this will show up as an immediate transfer of funds, and this can take days or even weeks to come back to their cards. (Credit cards work differently and are much preferred by the hotel industry because of this) Thus, *even if the whole thing is set up perfectly*, your employees may see a hefty Authorization Hold on their cards.\n\nThe Incidentals card getting run for the fees is actually pretty common. The parking fees, resort fees, wifi fees are all *preauthorized* upon the guest's card at checkin. If they're also adding a heavy incidentals (usually if the place has Room Service and other costly things) that can add up quickly.\n\nThe Incidental card getting run for the entire stay is usually due to inattentive or lazy hotel staff. They're on autopilot - greet person, get card for person, run card for the room, give keys. The employees should be very clear that the room and tax and all fees should go onto your company card, not theirs.\n\nThere is one option, though it's a bit risky. On those Credit Card Authorization forms, you can usually indicate that it's for All Charges. Make it VERY clear to your staff that they're not to be abusing that. This way your employees don't have to add their own cards, but has the chance that someone will run up a big bill.\n\nThere is also the hybrid option. Have the authorization for All Charges, Then once the employee is given the keys (and all those pesky authorization holds have been applied), they then add their own card to the account *without* it being authorized. Just 'on file'. The hotel staff can then add any other charges such as breakfast or the like to the employee card, secure in knowing that if it doesn't go through, your company card will be there.\n\nBut yeah, talk to the hotel directly to make sure that it's all being set up properly.\n\n## Comment ID je8tboe with +2 score by [(Top_Of_Gov_Watchlist, Reddit, 2023-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/je8tboe/) (in reply to ID 125xllt):\nEasiest thing to do is contact the hotel directly early the day your guest are to arrive.

However me being the front desk employee cant risk a several thousand dollar charge back. That would probably be my job. \n\nIf you end up staying at the same hotels generally the staff will know you and your guest.

I can gladly hold while you find it.\"\n\nI definitely would suggest picking 1 hotel in a city with 2 back up locations and speak with their sales teams. \n\nAnother suggestion is to fax or email the credit card authorization 24 hrs prior and day of arrival. Typically try to include the cc and matching driver's license as they will accept that as a more qualified cc auth.

We all know the company and the two people that make the reservations by name… no issues since we put this in place almost a year ago.\n\n## Comment ID jsk7ykc with +1 score by [(Emcqueen13, Reddit, 2023-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/jsk7ykc/) (in reply to ID 125xllt):\nHi!

      "# Post ID 18wykdu: 3rd party website booked the wrong dates for my stay. Nobody will refund me. with +154 score by [(True_Nectarine5875, Reddit, 2024-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/18wykdu/3rd_party_website_booked_the_wrong_dates_for_my/)\nHi everyone.  I booked a hotel stay at the Sheraton through traveluro.com and for some reason the dates they booked for me were not what I entered.  I've contacted them exhaustively and they claim no fault of their own and tell me the booking is non refundable and can't be altered.  Called the hotel they say their hands are tied due to it being booked through a 3rd party and they can't refund or change dates. \n\nObviously the biggest lesson I'm taking away from this is not to book through 3rd parties anymore.  But in the meantime is there anything else I can do to save my $350? I would think it's an ironclad case for a chargeback since I didn't choose the dates they booked but I worry something like that would be impossible to prove and the bank would reject my attempt. Am I simply shit out of luck here?\n\n## Comment ID kg12a2a with +72 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/18wykdu/3rd_party_website_booked_the_wrong_dates_for_my/kg12a2a/) (in reply to ID 18wykdu):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID kg1651r with +21 score by [(TellThemISaidHi, Reddit, 2024-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/18wykdu/3rd_party_website_booked_the_wrong_dates_for_my/kg1651r/) (in reply to ID kg12a2a):\nYep. I'm curious about how much of a savings \"Traveluro\" or whatever offered as opposed to just booking a Sheraton directory with Marriott. \n\nFrom the word \"dates\" I'm guessing it's at least 2 nights. So, $350 is $175 per night if only 2 nights. At 3 nights, we're looking at under $120 each.\n\nWhat was Marriott's usual rate?

There's a reason why you're not supposed to get a receipt from FD at check out if you booked 3rd party- those 3rd party companies do not want guests to know what they paid the 3rd party vs what the hotel actually got paid (read: it's quite a bit different).

That's all automatically sent when you process the booking. Double check your dates in the future. In terms of a refund, you prolly won't get one as you are the one that selected the dates on the website, but hotels are usually more lenient with date changes than cancelations on 3rs parties. Call the booking company and ask to change your dates.

The whole process is automatic so it's unlikely that Holisto (parent company of Traveluro) had any direct involvement with your reservation. From the hotel's perspective, they are correct in saying that their hands are tied in terms of a refund. My advice would be to see if there's any way they could move the date and you pay the difference / a fee such as the commission directly to the hotel? They might not be happy doing this because of the way the hotel receives the money from third parties, though. If it is non-refundable and non-amendable then it is a bit of a pickle that you're in. I think what most likely happened (which I know to have happened before) is guests select a date and the booking engine occasionally defaults to a different date when you go on to the next stage. Assuming you realised and started contacting as soon as the reservation was made?\n\n## Comment ID kg17qbf with +18 score by [(LompocianLady, Reddit, 2024-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/18wykdu/3rd_party_website_booked_the_wrong_dates_for_my/kg17qbf/) (in reply to ID 18wykdu):\nAre you certain you didn't make the mistake of switching month and day?

Only to magically immediately book you *different* dates and provide email confirmation of those different dates. \n\nI worked for AMEX years ago and had to oversee and help with issues in concierge and travel for the centurion (black) card … I never once in all my years and thousands of instances of looking into fuck ups had a case where the person/agent/customer booking didn’t accidentally fuck it up despite vehemently denying it. Everything is recorded and id have to go through the screen recordings, etc…. Not *once* was it an instance where they correctly navigated everything … got to the final confirmation screen with all the correct info … pressed submit … and boom … different dates booked. More often than not the website was confusing and/or reverted to different month/dates during the booking process at some point but it *always* showed the wrong info before hitting submit.

If it's confusing, that's a design flaw.  If it reverts to different dates on it's own after they've been entered but before final confirmation, that is also a design flaw.\n\nI find it bizarre to place the moral responsibility for that on the consumer who doesn't catch it.  That framing makes me think of the phone scams run on the vulnerable elderly, tricking them into sending all their money to the scammers - that's technically all their \"fault\" too, if you ignore the sophistication of the predators.

There are only a handful that corporate Marriott works with and negotiates for the whole company. That doesn’t stop companies like Traveluro from selling rooms though unfortunately. The reservations will be honored if they are properly communicated to the hotel by Traveluro, but since they are not a travel partner of Marriott, you really have no recourse with Marriott. \n\nNow, I would definitely issue the charge back. Presumably you have emails and such showing you attempted to get a refund and explain the situation. Worst case is that yes, you’re SOL but maybe it’ll work\n\nFor the future, always book with the hotel directly. Besides, with Marriott hotels, they have a best rate guarantee on their website which means you will ALWAYS get the best price booking direct. They are not allowed to offer discounts on Expedia, booking, etc. so at best, you get the same price and extra hassle. If you ever see a lower price from Marriott on a third party site, you can submit a claim (simply form online) to be compensated for the fact that you paid more on Marriotts website. That wouldn’t apply in this case since Traveluro isn’t a Marriott partner and they’re essentially selling stuff they have no authority to sell but just so you know in the future, you have nothing to lose by buying on Marriotts site directly\n\n## Comment ID kg2bnll with +2 score by [(kms1010, Reddit, 2024-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/18wykdu/3rd_party_website_booked_the_wrong_dates_for_my/kg2bnll/) (in reply to ID 18wykdu):\nAs lots of people have said, you might consider contacting your CC company.

Once I booked a hotel room and didn't realize the last date to cancel was a full 6 wks before my check-in and when my event was cancelled because of Covid, the 3rd party site said too bad and the hotel said they couldn't help because it wasn't booked through them directly. The hotel's cancellation policy was only 24 hours! Also, I was told by a smaller hotel that if I see a better price on say [hotels.com](https://hotels.com), just call the hotel directly and ask if they can match the price. This person said they would because they'd come out better anyway because of all the fees they have to pay to the 3rd party site.\n\n## Comment ID kg4bhvb with +2 score by [(OtherwiseSprinkles79, Reddit, 2024-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/18wykdu/3rd_party_website_booked_the_wrong_dates_for_my/kg4bhvb/) (in reply to ID 18wykdu):\nOne of the smartest things I learned from TikTok was to book flights, hotels etc. directly through them and not a third party site.

And if this is a low rated site it will likely be easy to prove they made the error. Have you researched and read any messages from others it happened to? My husband recently had to fight an on line order that was nothing like what we ordered and what description read. The on line retailer would not let us return. He included screen shots of pages of other complaints regarding this on line retailer (lesson learned do more research *before* purchasing). Took almost 6 months of back and forth, pictures, on line reviews and we finally got our $2000 charge reversed and credit card company blocked doing business with this on line retailer as with all the research my husband uncovered this on line retailer is not dealing in good faith.\n\nETA: we travel a lot and stopped booking through 3rd parties 15 years ago.

A travel and expense management platform is beginning to become a necessity, but knowing the golden rule of this sub (NEVER use a third party booking platform!) i am hesitant to sign up for a company that issues tickets like a third party platform does. I have been looking into Navan and TravelPerk to see if they are a good fit, but it looks like Navan acts as a travel agent and issues airline tickets themselves.

Lufthansa has a travel agency that service a lot of German companies for example. But it would be best to look at utilising a third party agency who issue on their stock. They’ll have a contact team for you in case of any changes/cancellations, but will support implementing an online booking tool for you and your employees to self serve on. You’ll find many companies book travel this way. \n\nSAP Concur is another one you can consider. They’ll refer you to one of their recommended partner agencies to handle the travel side that will complement the expense side. Then there are other agencies that don’t have an expense system that may be well suited to a small business like your’s, and can potentially set you up with a line of credit or something along those lines.\n\n## Comment ID l0arunj with +1 score by [(HIPL_IT_Services, Reddit, 2024-04-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/118f6kt/advice_needed_travel_managers_do_you_have_a/l0arunj/) (in reply to ID 118f6kt):\nAbsolutely, when it comes to business travel management software, TESS360 stands out as my preferred choice.

A lot of us feel like our job security is always on the line, which is super stressful. The turnover rate is really high because the leadership is always on the lookout for who they think are “low performers,” and it’s tough to see good people leave all the time. Leadership tends to point fingers and play favorites, which doesn’t help with trust or accountability. They also seem to have a very simplistic, results-only approach that doesn’t handle big issues well, leading to half-baked solutions. The pressure to perform is intense and relentless, and it’s definitely taken a toll on morale and led to burnout for many.\n\nIn a nutshell, while the company is doing great in terms of growth and product success, the internal culture and leadership style make it a tough place to feel secure and supported.",

They structure an unattainable an ever-increasing monthly quota that's always positioned just 1-2 months beyond reach, as to ensure that even though you're making them more and more money, they're invariably paying you less and less commission. They needlessly waste so much of your time with unnecessary internal meetings that continuously derail your day, detracting you from effectively managing your time and actually being able to successfully do your job. They offer \"Unlimited PTO,\" but then gaslight and punish you for ever actually wanting to use any of it ... They possess a cult-like mentality led by Leader Elia Wallen and his Inner Circle keeping the majority of employees in the dark, contributing to fundamental breaches in interdepartmental communication, and ultimately not allowing one hand to see what the other hand's doing.

There were a lot of people you could gurantee would stay with the company on the old structure because the money alone made them eager to stay. Now it's even hard to say what i will make on a deal. Marketing doesn't work with the sales org and we are constantly competing. R90 is obviously incredibly flawed. Take into account that a lot of AEs have been here longer than you and we're treated like we don't know what were doing and feels like we're heard less and less as time goes on. Figure it out.",

Enacted R90 which is essentially a 2nd quota that penalizes if you don't hit your number, but does not reward you for hitting/exceeding the number it can cut your commission check by 30%. Not a good system at all less than 30% of the org hit it this last month.",

The facade presented at Hotel Engine is a thin veil of \"Rah Rah we're all awesome, we work together!\" While in reality it's a kiss the ring or leave or be removed environment.

They make arbitrary decisions without actual knowledge of situations, projects, or other insights from more involved individuals. It's a \"Do as I say, not as I do\" culture built on fear and don't dare try to voice opinions that differ from Senior Leadership or those who just fall in line. \n\nMy experience with HE consisted of: \nReporting to 3 different Directors in 4 months. The Director I interviewed with and was hired by left the organization before I even started. The VP I would then roll up to went on leave shortly after joining. The next Director I reported to left the role after 1 month because what they came into wasn't what was represented in their interview process. My final Director - my role and theirs were eliminated less than 1 month after they joined, around 3 1/2 months after I took the role. Also in this time, I was moved from the team I was hired to join to another team because of all the Director transitions. When my role was eliminated, I was told by senior leadership, that my projects were not where they expected them to be and my employment was ending. How can someone be realistically set up for success with so much turnover and no direction on what priorities are? I had multiple other projects in the process but leadership likely had no idea because they don't ask questions, they just make assumptions that have broad impacts. It shows they don't know what they are doing. I had multiple HE employees reach out saying they didn't think I or the other individuals whose roles were eliminated were set up for success, and that starts from the top down. \n\nAlso to address any positive reviews here or elsewhere, in my first month I had an HR representative reach out asking if I would write a review for HE on Glassdoor about my experience. It reeked of desperation, and who being at a new company has any valuable insights in their first month of employment?",

How can someone be realistically set up for success with so much turnover and no direction on what priorities are? I had multiple other projects in the process but leadership likely had no idea because they don't ask questions, they just make assumptions that have broad impacts. It shows they don't know what they are doing. I had multiple HE employees reach out saying they didn't think I or the other individuals whose roles were eliminated were set up for success, and that starts from the top down. \n\nAlso to address any positive reviews here or elsewhere, in my first month I had an HR representative reach out asking if I would write a review for HE on Glassdoor about my experience.

      "# [Hotel Engine Achieves $2.1B Valuation With $140M Permira Investment](https://www.permira.com/news-and-insights/announcements/hotel-engine-achieves-21b-valuation-with-140m-permira-investment)\n“Next-gen” business travel platform announces Series C, new services and new name\n\nDenver — Sept. 17 2024 — With new products and a new brand on the horizon, travel technology leader Hotel Engine today announced a $140M Series C growth investment led by Permira Growth Opportunities II, a fund advised by global private equity firm Permira.\n\nHotel Engine will use the funding to support ongoing product development, including the launch of flight and rental car bookings to its platform. The new booking options will go live in October, making Hotel Engine an all-in-one solution for business travel.\n\nAlongside the new product release, Hotel Engine will change its name to \"Engine\" to reflect its expanded focus.\n\n“Hotel bookings will always be in our DNA, but we’re out to transform the entire travel experience,” said Hotel Engine CEO Elia Wallen. “We want to become the engine of business travel. Our new name will reflect that, and with Permira’s latest investment, we’ll be better positioned than ever to turn our ambitions into reality.”\n\nDenver-based Hotel Engine has quickly become a go-to option for business travelers thanks to its industry-leading tech and innovative features like consolidated invoices, coverage for incidentals, 24/7 customer support, whole-company trip insurance and free travel-management software to help customers save time and money. Hotel Engine’s contract-free approach with no minimums or agent-assist fees makes adoption easy for businesses of all types and sizes.\n\nHotel Engine connects business travelers to a robust network of more than 750,000 hotels, 300 airlines and 40 rental car companies.

This investment values the company at a whopping $2.1 billion, a big increase from its previous valuation of $1.3 billion in 2021.\n\nThe company, founded in 2015, has developed a platform that connects business travelers with a network of over 750,000 hotels, 300 airlines, and 40 rental car companies. Hotel Engine differentiates itself by offering a contract-free model, eliminating minimum spend requirements and agent-assist fees often associated with traditional managed travel services.\n\nThe platform provides businesses with features such as consolidated invoices, 24/7 customer support, and travel insurance. It also offers a free Partner Hub software platform for travel providers, enabling them to manage reservations, create marketing campaigns, and offer special deals to business travelers.\n\nHotel Engine reports being profitable and experiencing 70% year-over-year revenue growth. The company projects booking over 10 million room nights this year.\n\nThis latest funding round will support Engine’s expansion beyond hotel bookings. The company plans to launch flight and rental car bookings on its platform in October, aiming to become a comprehensive travel management solution for businesses. To reflect this expanded focus, the company will rebrand as “Engine.”\n\nIn a press statement, Elia Wallen, CEO of Hotel Engine, stated, “Hotel bookings will always be in our DNA, but we’re out to transform the entire travel experience. We want to become the engine of business travel. Our new name will reflect that, and with Permira’s latest investment, we’ll be better positioned than ever to turn our ambitions into reality.”\n\nThis investment in Hotel Engine reflects the broader recovery of the business travel sector following the pandemic-induced slump. Companies offering services that streamline travel management and enhance efficiency are experiencing increased demand as businesses resume travel activities.\n\nThe funding also highlights the rebounding venture capital and private equity markets, which experienced a downturn due to rising interest rates. Investors are increasingly seeking opportunities in companies with strong growth potential and a proven track record of success, like Hotel Engine.\n\nThe company’s expansion into flight and rental car bookings positions it to compete more directly with established travel management companies. However, Engine’s success will depend on its ability to effectively integrate these new offerings into its platform, maintain its customer-centric approach, and navigate the complexities of the broader travel market.\n\nThe rebranding to “Engine” signifies the company’s ambition to become a comprehensive travel management solution, powering the entire business travel experience. Whether Engine can achieve this ambitious goal and solidify its position as a leader in the evolving travel technology landscape remains to be seen.",

      "# [Hotel Engine CEO Talks Growth After $140 Million Fundraise by Justin Dawes on 2024-10-03](https://skift.com/2024/10/03/hotel-engine-ceo-talks-growth-after-140-million-fundraise/)\nHotel Engine recently raised one of the year’s largest rounds of capital for a travel startup: $140 million, which valued the firm at $2.1 billion.\n\nThe Denver-based company provides a tech platform that travel managers use to book business trips. Historically, the focus has been on hotel bookings, but flights and car rentals are joining the mix starting this month. Once that happens, the company is dropping “Hotel” from its name and will go by Engine to reflect that expanded focus.\n\nThe company also offers hotels tech tools for bookings management, marketing, dynamic pricing, and more.\n\nHotel Engine is focused on small- and mid-sized companies in the U.S. Skift spoke with its founder and CEO, Elia Wallen, about what comes next.\n\nThe Competition\n\nHotel Engine has a lot of competitors. Navan, based in New York City, most recently raised $154 million in equity at a valuation of $9.2 billion. This year, Navan hired a former New York Stock Exchange executive as its CFO ahead of an anticipated IPO.\n\nTravelPerk, based in Barcelona, most recently raised $104 million at a valuation of $1.4 billion.\n\nThere’s been some significant M&A activity, as well: Amex GBT earlier this year announced plans to acquire CWT for $570 million.\n\nAll of these companies have been growing and expect to continue. But especially for small- and medium-sized companies — which is where Hotel Engine is focused — there’s still a lot of business up for grabs.\n\n“It’s a really big market, and there’s going to be a lot of winners and a lot of losers — you see these little companies pop up and down all the time,” Wallen said. “I think once you get to a certain scale, that there’s room for everyone, and we’re going to carve out our corner of the market.”\n\nThe Global Business Travel Association expects travel spending to exceed pre-pandemic levels of $1.4 trillion this year and exceed $2 trillion by 2028.\n\nBusiness Growth\n\nWallen said that Hotel Engine is seeing 70% growth in revenue compared to last year. And he projects “triple-digit” growth next year. The company is on track to sell about 10 million room nights this year.\n\nAbout 5% of the company’s business comes from outside the U.S. With the three product lines, the company will ramp up its effort abroad in 2025, he said.\n\nHotel Engine has 700 employees right now, and he expects to hire another 300-500 in the next year.\n\n‘We’re Cash Flow Positive and Profitable’\n\nThe company raised $65 million in 2021 at a $1.3 billion valuation and raised $16 million in 2019 at a valuation of over $150 million.\n\nHotel Engine had spent only $20 million of that total before it raised its most recent round, Wallen said.\n\n“All the money that we’ve raised has not just hit the balance sheet and been lit on fire, as many do.” Wallen said. “A lot of people have to keep raising money every year to keep the lights on. We’re cash flow positive and profitable.”\n\nA small portion of the latest funding went toward the balance sheet, but the majority was raised as a secondary offering, he said, which essentially allows early investors and employees to cash out some of their holdings. Completing a secondary offering is often a sign of financial health for the company because it shows it doesn’t need outside capital to continue operations.\n\nThe round was led by a growth equity fund under private equity firm Permira.\n\nWhat’s Next: More Products, AI, and Maybe Acquisitions\n\nHotel Engine has been focused solely on hotels, but Wallen said customers wanted a place where they could more purchase products in one place.\n\n“The first five years, it was heads down, build the best network we can with our hotel partners,” he said. “As we had this nice foundation of lodging, it was the next natural evolution. Most people are expecting three in one.”\n\nThe platform also has a feature for booking large groups of rooms, such as for a corporate event. And the company recently opened that feature to consumers, who can book blocks or rooms for at least nine people. He believes there’s more opportunity in that specific area of the sector.\n\n“It’s a pretty broken space,” Wallen said.\n\nUsers should also expect to see more AI integrations.\n\n“We are definitely investing heavily there. And I think we’ll see how far it goes. The story’s being written currently.”\n\nHotel Engine doesn’t have a team dedicated to searching for M&A right now, but the company is going to start considering those types of deals.\n\n“We’re fully organic to date – we haven’t done any acquisitions. But just given the dynamics of the market … it does seem like there’s a higher probability that it happens next year than ever before.”",

      "# [Exclusive: Hotel Engine reaches a $2.1 billion valuation, rebrands as Engine by Allie Garfinkle on 2024-09-17](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-hotel-engine-reaches-2-111425206.html)\nElia Wallen never expected this.\n\nWallen started Hotel Engine as a subsidiary of corporate housing company Travelers Haven in 2015, meeting a long-standing customer request—assistance with hotel bookings. Wallen founded Travelers Haven in 2008 (the company reached $100 million in revenue in 2022, and was acquired by Blueground in 2023). But over time, the Hotel Engine side project gained more and more traction, becoming impossible to ignore.\n\n“As these stories sometimes go, the little brother became the big brother,” said Wallen. “You hear stories about these products that people build as little side things, then they grow—and that’s essentially what happened. So, I moved over to Hotel Engine full-time in February 2020. We raised our first money in the summer of 2019, and that was actually the first money I ever raised.”\n\nWallen’s gambit has paid off. The company today reached a massive milestone: Hotel Engine has raised a $140 million Series C led by Permira, Fortune can exclusively report. The funding bumps its valuation to $2.1 billion, up from $1.3 billion during the 2021 round. With new investment in hand, Hotel Engine will now expand beyond hotels, launching flight and rental car booking capabilities to its platform in October. The Denver-based company will accordingly change its name to reflect the wider focus, becoming Engine.\n\n“We joke internally that whoever named this company wasn’t thinking big enough,” said Wallen. “Hotel Engine, when it was tucked under Travelers Haven, made all the sense in the world. I wasn’t considering that it would get this big, so the name change really goes along with that.”\n\nAnd Engine has indeed grown, coming out on the other side of the pandemic profitable. The company is currently seeing revenue growth of 70% year over year and says it expects to book more than ten million room nights in 2024. Wallen is also eyeing areas of possible expansion once the company’s move into flights and rental cars is settled.\n\n“Groups is one that I should touch on,” he told Fortune. “The group industry, it’s meetings, conferences, and events. It’s a very, very big space. It’s very broken and very manual. You’re planning a wedding, what do you do? You’re going to research a handful of hotels right near a venue, and maybe the venue is a hotel. Then, you’re literally going to pick up the phone. We have the most modern platform for that business. It’s growing very fast so we believe groups is going to be a very big opportunity.”\n\nOne of the most striking things about listening to Wallen is his exceedingly measured approach to raising capital. He tells me that, to date, Engine has spent less than half of the $56 million in primary funding the company raised before this new round.",

    "# Hotel Engine Comprehensive Report\n\n## Company Overview\nHotel Engine, soon to be rebranded as \"Engine,\" is a Denver-based travel technology company founded in 2015. It specializes in providing a platform for business travelers to book accommodations, and it has rapidly grown to become a significant player in the corporate travel sector. The company connects users to a network of over 750,000 hotels, 300 airlines, and 40 rental car companies, offering a contract-free model that eliminates minimum spend requirements and agent-assist fees, which are common in traditional managed travel services [(Permira, 2024)](https://www.permira.com/news-and-insights/announcements/hotel-engine-achieves-21b-valuation-with-140m-permira-investment).\n\n## Recent Developments\nOn September 17, 2024, Hotel Engine announced a $140 million Series C funding round led by Permira Growth Opportunities II, valuing the company at $2.1 billion, a substantial increase from its previous valuation of $1.3 billion in November 2021 [(Hotel Engine, 2024)](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/17/2947398/0/en/Hotel-Engine-Achieves-2-1B-Valuation-With-140M-Permira-Investment.html).

The company has utilized only $20 million of outside capital to reach its current valuation, indicating a strong financial position and profitability [(Skift, 2024)](https://skift.com/2024/10/03/hotel-engine-ceo-talks-growth-after-140-million-fundraise/).

He transitioned to focus on Hotel Engine full-time in February 2020, after its initial success as a subsidiary of Travelers Haven. Wallen's vision includes expanding the platform's capabilities and potentially exploring mergers and acquisitions in the future, although the company has remained fully organic to date [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-hotel-engine-reaches-2-111425206.html).

The company's focus on providing a comprehensive travel management solution, coupled with its strong financial performance and leadership vision, makes it an attractive opportunity for prospective candidates and investors alike. As it transitions to \"Engine,\" the company aims to solidify its place as a leader in the evolving travel technology landscape."
