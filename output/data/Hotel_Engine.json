      "# [How Does a Boutique Hotel Differ From a Regular Hotel? by Audrey Fairbrother on 2021-12-13](https://engine.com/business-travel-guide/boutique-hotel)\nDecades ago, lodging experiences fell into a few distinct categories.\n\nYou could splurge on pricey suites at a flashy big-name hotel with room service and beach side balconies.\n\nOr spend two weeks at a mid-range hotel, lounging poolside, dining at the on-site restaurant, and playing pick-up tennis matches.\n\nOr choose the sketchy motel down a back alley, listed at a quarter of the price with few amenities.\n\nAnd then the 1980s came along and changed everything.\n\nBoutique hotels quickly emerged on the scene with a brand new option.\n\nThey were a luxurious alternative for travelers who couldnât afford a five-star stay. They spoke to a crowd ready to engulf themselves in the local culture with a more personal, sophisticated lodging experience.\n\nWhat exactly are boutique hotels like nowadays? And, as a business traveler, why should you book a suite at a boutique?\n\nBefore you book your next business trip, read this!\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. What Is a Boutique Hotel?\n\n2. Typical Boutique Hotel Features\n\n3. Examples of Boutique Hotels\n\n4. Why Business Travelers Love Boutique Hotels\n\n5. Book Your Boutique Hotel Through Engine and Save!\n\nWhat Is a Boutique Hotel?\n\nBoutique hotels are quaint, sophisticated, and intimate luxury hotels. Theyâre especially popular with the hipster and Millennial crowds. These hotels typically have 10â100 guest rooms and put an unconventional (and sometimes quirky) spin on traditional lodging.\n\nThe boutique hotel experience thrives off the heart of the surrounding area and the booming personality of its unique amenities and interior design.\n\nFor example, The George (in upper-class Montclair, New Jersey) offers a fitting historical touch for an area rich in American history. Its 31 elegant rooms display old-fashioned paintings of presidents John F. Kennedy and George Washington and antique-style furniture. Itâs also located in the heart of Montclairâs urban district and is a quick cab ride away from the city.\n\nBut boutique hotels are more than just a temporary home-away-from-home.\n\nMany also:\n\nHost private tours of hidden gems within the city\n\nOffer celebrity-chef dining options\n\nInclude pet-friendly rooms\n\nProvide unique common areas (like gardens)\n\nHave a concierge staff that knows guestsâ names\n\nOne thingâs for sure: every boutique hotel has its own flair.\n\nThe History of Boutique Hotels\n\nThe first boutique hotel was the Morgans Hotel in New York City (Manhattan). Hoteliers Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager opened the 114-room Italian Romanesque-themed hotel in 1984 as a retreat for Studio 54 (a nearby disco club) regulars and wealthy guests.\n\n(Thereâs still some debate whether it was the first one ever, a title often attributed to the Blakes Hotel in London or the Bedford in San Francisco.)\n\nThe 19-floor Morgans Hotel offered a one-of-a-kind, lavish getaway.\n\nThe low-profile hotel was a captivating blend of chic, casual, luxurious, and monochromatic. Rooms and corridors featured high-end Italian granite floors, 40s-era teak chairs, lit candles, and airplane sinks.\n\nThe Morgans in New York and the Bedford in San Francisco kickstarted the boutique hotel trend from either coast. These against-the-grain hotels later spread from major cities to less-traveled tourist destinations.\n\nToday, America is home to more than 4,642 boutique hotels.\n\nHow many of these insider hotel terms are you familiar with? Bookmark These Hotel Terms (and Acronyms!): A Glossary for Business Travel Planners\n\nTypical Boutique Hotel Features\n\nThe full boutique hotel experience goes well beyond its classy exterior and small hotel feel. The appeal of these hotels lies in their intricate features:\n\nIn the Rooms\n\nFor Rubell and Schrager, the inspiration behind the Morgans Hotel was the desire to revolutionize the hospitality industry by inching toward a more memorable and trendy stay.\n\nThe rooms themselves are more than just temporary bedrooms on a three-night business trip. Instead, they deliver an unforgettable, engulfing experience with tiny details for guests to discover. One might find vintage 40s sofas or a bookshelf stocked with old-timey reads from the 17th century.\n\nThereâs no telling what youâll see when you open the door to your suite. Thatâs because boutique hotel rooms are interior design marvels.\n\nSome rooms are decade-inspired, with the oranges, clean lines, and psychedelic wallpapers of the 70s. Others are a time warp to several centuries ago, fitted with antique memorabilia and luxurious over-the-bed chandeliers.\n\nHowever, the possibilities are truly endless.\n\nBoutique rooms can feel like authentic Roman villas or Prohibition-era dens. Or even Old West cabins, contemporary beachfront rooms, or chambers in a Medieval castle.\n\nSome rooms are even individually decorated so that no two rooms in the hotel look the same.\n\nIn Its Amenities\n\nA hotelâs amenities are often the biggest draw for travelers craving a comfortable stay. At boutique hotels, these offerings range from luxurious to convenient, entertaining to peaceful.\n\nThese sometimes unspoken luxuries may include:\n\nPet-friendly rooms\n\nComplementary and gourmet breakfasts\n\nCompletely custom toiletries\n\nMusical performances on-site\n\nChef-prepared restaurant meals\n\nAuthentic wool throw blankets\n\nMarble or granite floors\n\nPillow menus\n\nFreestanding tubs\n\nFree bicycle rentals\n\nLocal artwork or locally made furniture\n\nComplimentary snacks and bottled water\n\nMany boutiques also include basic amenities, such as in-room Wi-Fi, 24/7 coffee machines, and a heated pool.\n\nIn the Hotel Itself\n\nThe lobby, corridors, and common areas add the finishing touches to your stay, at least on the hotelâs premises.\n\nSmall-scale boutique hotels welcome guests with features like:\n\nClassy lobby bars with a cocktail hour\n\nReception areas\n\nMeeting and conference rooms\n\nRooftop gardens, pools, and sitting areas\n\nMulti-story spas, fitness centers, and cafes\n\nArt galleries\n\nWide-open lounges with fireplaces\n\nMarble hallways, floors, and staircases\n\nPersonal concierge services\n\nInterior balconies over the lobby\n\nWater features and fountains\n\nEvery corner of boutique hotels is worth exploring during the downtime between meetings or while waiting out a sunshower. For business travelers particularly, there are dozens of scenic places to break out your laptop or take an important business call.\n\nIn the Surrounding Area\n\nItâs no coincidence that boutique hotels sprout up in popular urban areas. Thatâs because boutique hotels thrive on that deep connection to nearby hotspots, cuisine, and culture. In fact, a large part of the boutique hotel experience is exploring local attractions.\n\nGuests head out on foot to visit monuments, museums, art galleries, town squares, parks, concert halls, or historical places.\n\nFor example, a boutique hotel in Amsterdam may have a local guide on-staff who hosts guided tours of Dam Square or the Royal Palace. In Bali, boutiques might host excursions to the nearby temples, forests, or rice terraces.\n\nWhile boutique hoteliers encourage guests to experience the local charm, they also do the opposite â bring the local area in.\n\nThe one common thread between most boutique hotels is pride in the surrounding city. So youâll find local college sports memorabilia, artwork produced by locals, and snapshots of the area pre-renovation.\n\nHotels in larger cities like Miami or Los Angeles may also provide accommodations and transportation for more wanderlust guests. For example, tickets to a local theater or festival, reservations at Latin restaurants, or shuttle services to nearby train or rail stations.\n\nDiscover: Top Day Trips from Business Travel Destinations\n\nExamples of Boutique Hotels\n\nThe beauty in boutique hotels is that no two are even remotely the same.\n\nWhile most common in bustling urban areas, these hotels can be high-end, extensions of big-name hotel brands, bed and breakfasts, independent hotels, and everything in between. The only caveats are that theyâre small, sophisticated, modern, and welcoming.\n\nHereâs an in-depth look at some of the best boutique hotels and what makes them so unique:\n\nThe Curio Collection by Hilton Hotel\n\nThe Curio Collection is the Hilton Hotel chainâs venture into the boutique hotel industry. Each of its 100 four or five-star boutiques boasts its own unique vibe and immerses guests in the local culture.\n\nThe Hotel Saski Krakow in Poland, situated in the cityâs square, is one of the collectionâs newest welcomes. The former 19th-century hotel and concert hall is now an affordable boutique hotel in the heart of Krakow. It offers a bed-and-breakfast feel while being within walking distance of museums.\n\nDespite being within the same collection, the Highland Dallas delivers a diverse and stylish urban stay in the heart of Texas. This modernized boutique hotel is home to a spa, fancy bar, and business-centric conference rooms.\n\nKimpton Hotels\n\nThe 75 global Kimpton Hotels are proof that, in the boutique hotel world, location matters.\n\nIts hotel line-up includes hotels along the white sand beaches of Mexico, near the nightlife in Atlanta, and surrounded by the contemporary architecture of Bangkok. Each Kimpton boutique brings its own surprises and styles.\n\nLooking to get more out of your next business trip? Check out: 7 Underused Hotel Services and Amenities (and How to Find Hotels That Offer Them)\n\nWhy Business Travelers Love Boutique Hotels\n\nBoutique hotels are popular amongst the younger, trendier crowds.\n\nHowever, if you have an upcoming business trip, hereâs why you might consider booking a suite at a boutique hotel.:\n\nTouch of Luxury\n\nBoutique hotels are all luxurious by nature, even if they lack ritzy chandeliers, marble floors, and upscale penthouses. Classic boutiques typically offer four or five-star lodging with a myriad of amenities available.\n\nDuring your business tripâs downtime, you can splurge on a 60-minute massage and admire local artwork hung in the corridors. Or dine in the hotelâs sushi restaurant and sunbathe by the saltwater pool mid-afternoon.\n\nA Quiet Retreat\n\nPerhaps the biggest draw to business travelers is that boutique hotels are quiet, cozy oases. With no more than 100 rooms in total, the lobby and hallways are almost always empty and quiet.\n\nYour fellow guests also booked a boutique suite for the same reason. Those that hang back are there to appreciate a peaceful and relaxing vacation, while those who venture out keep the premises virtually guest-free.\n\nBoutiques are the perfect place to lay your head down after a long day of meetings or continue business calls uninterrupted.\n\nA Sense of Place\n\nThose who book boutique hotel rooms consider their lodging to be a crucial piece of their destination. Even in the dead of night or with the curtains shut, one look around the room or lobby will only add to your travel experience.\n\nEvery carefully selected piece of decor, paint color, light fixture, and furniture will remind you of exactly where your boss sent you. Make the most of your business travel by experiencing the city, even if you donât venture too far from the hotel.\n\nFrom the concierge to the bellhops, the staff is also incredibly friendly, and you may even end your trip on a first-name basis.\n\nImmersion With Local Culture & Cuisine\n\nAt the heart of cities and historical hotspots, boutique hotels are an efficient way to explore your destination without spending too much time in the back of a cab or on a train.\n\nMany boutiques boast gourmet coffee shops, restaurants, and gift shops on the boutique property. Others are within walking distance of historical homes, nationally known eateries, the riverside, or market squares.\n\nThese are the perfect places to galavant after hours!\n\nUnique Amenities & a One-of-a-Kind, Memorable Getaway\n\nIf nothing else, boutique suites are unpredictable and one-of-a-kind (in a good way).\n\nEach hotel has its own local touch, interior design style, and historical significance. So thereâs no doubt youâll remember your next business trip, even if you only venture out of the room once or twice!\n\nYou may also like: 7 Productive Things You Can Do on a Business Trip\n\nBook Your Boutique Hotel Through Engine and Save!\n\nA stay at a boutique hotel brings a once-in-a-lifetime experience. But it doesnât have to consume your entire per-diem travel budget!\n\nWith Engine, you guarantee the best boutique hotel suites at affordable rates. Learn more about how to book a room at more than 700,000 hotels (including boutiques) while saving an average of 60% on lodging.\n\nConclusion\n\nBoutique hotels took the hotel industry by storm nearly 40 years ago. Today, theyâre more popular than ever and guarantee an exciting trip, even if itâs strictly business-related or a single night away from home.\n\nThe question is: which boutique hotel speaks to you?\n\nIs it an urban-themed hotel in downtown Manhattan? Or a beachside villa on the shores of Italy? A mid-western cabin in Minnesota?\n\nWe guess that depends on where your next business trip takes you!\n\nBut no matter which you book, one thingâs for sure:\n\nYouâre in for a world of unique experiences, personalized service, and limitless types of hotels.\n\nâ",
      "# [35+ Hotel Terms All Business Travel Planners Should Know by Audrey Fairbrother on 2021-09-19](https://engine.com/business-travel-guide/hotel-terms)\nThe travel industry has so many of its own terms and acronyms that it can sound like another language.\n\nItâs not always easy to understand what they mean, especially if youâre new to the industry or arenât immersed in the hospitality business.\n\nBut, knowing all of the key hotel terms and acronyms will make it easier to book and manage business travel.\n\nWhether youâre a solo traveler or a corporate travel manager, this knowledge will help you:\n\nUnderstand the terms of your reservation better\n\nInteract with hospitality customer service in a straightforward and knowledgeable manner\n\nHave a better hotel/travel experience in general\n\nSo in this post, weâre going to teach you the terms insiders use in the hospitality industry.\n\nYouâll be speaking fluent hotel in no time!\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Hotel Terms and Acronyms That Travelers Need to Know\n\n2. Hotel Terms And Acronyms Commonly Used in the Hospitality Industry\n\nHotel Terms and Acronyms for Travel Planners\n\nLetâs start off with some essentials. These are terms that every traveler should get acquainted with.\n\nBoutique Hotel\n\nBoutique hotels offer a more luxurious, stylish, and unique experience for guests. Theyâre known for being comfortable, quiet, and a step above âaverageâ hotel rooms.\n\nFull Board\n\nFull board means that you can expect not only a hotel room but also breakfast, lunch, and an evening meal with your stay. A bed and breakfast, by contrast, includes only a bed and breakfast.\n\nGroup Rate\n\nA group rate is a lower price sometimes offered or given to groups when several hotel rooms (usually nine or more at a time) are booked at once.\n\nGroup rates help hotels to secure more bookings with large-scale clients, and they help guests by getting them a discount and a better deal on accommodations.\n\nEngine can get you a group rate at hotels all around the world. Learn how our corporate lodging services can save you both time and money!\n\nGuest Room\n\nGuest room is the term used to describe a single hotel room that contains one or more beds. Related terms include double room, which describes hotel accommodations with two rooms, or a suite, which is a larger, multi-room space.\n\nHalf Board\n\nHalf board means that you can expect not only a hotel room but also breakfast and one other meal with your stay.\n\nHotel Chain\n\nHotel chain is the term used to describe similarly branded hotels that operate under the ensign of a particular hotel group. They may be subsidized or franchised, but they must receive approval of some kind before operating a hotel under that particular brand.\n\nDiscover: 5 of the Best Hotel Chains for Business Stays and Events\n\nLocally Negotiated Rate (LNR)\n\nLNR stands for locally negotiated rate, which is an agreement made by the hotel with a local organization or corporate group to provide rooms or meeting spaces at more competitive rates in return for repeat business.\n\nMinimum Length of Stay (MoS)\n\nMoS, which means minimum length of stay, is a stay restriction policy that dictates the absolute minimum number of nights a guest must book a hotel room in order to secure the booking.\n\nNo-Show\n\nA no-show occurs when a guest reserves a room, fails to cancel the booking by the hotelâs cancellation deadline, and never arrives to claim their reservation.\n\nOnline Travel Agency (OTA)\n\nOnline travel agencies are online marketplaces where travelers can research booking information for things like flights, hotel rooms, rental cars, etc. These marketplaces also allow for seamless, instant booking and reservations.\n\nNow, if you need a step above an OTA, and want an easy-to-use booking solution that also provides tools and analytics for your business, Engine has you covered!\n\nRoom Nights\n\nRoom nights is a statistical metric used in the hospitality industry. It represents the total number of rooms a guest commits to occupying in exchange for a specific contracted rate.\n\nSo, if a guest books one room for three nights, they would be said to have generated âthree room nights.â\n\nNote that room nights do not necessarily equal the number of people staying at the hotel.\n\nTravel Management Companies (TMC)\n\nA TMC is a travel agency that aids companies in organizing travel processes, policies, plans, and bookings for their teams. They can often secure better rates than would otherwise be possible, thus saving companies time, money, and hassle.\n\nRelated: How to Find the Best Hotel for the Value\n\nIndustry Terms for Hotel and Housing Providers\n\nNow, weâre going to dive into some terms used by professionals in the hospitality industry.\n\nYou may not hear these terms every day, but knowing will help you to understand how hotels structure their deals and think about profits.\n\nTheyâre a bit more complicated, but here are some of the most common and important hotel terms used by hospitality pros.\n\nAverage Daily Rate (ADR)\n\nAverage daily rate is a metric used by businesses in the hospitality industry to help them calculate the amount of revenue earned for an occupied room on a given day. Itâs actually one of the most important key performance indicators (KPIs) hotels use to track the success of their business.\n\nADR is calculated by dividing the amount of revenue earned by the total number of rooms sold.\n\nAllocation\n\nAllocation is the process of selecting a specific, sometimes limited number of rooms to make available to guests. In some cases, hotel managers may choose to allocate only some rooms, thus leaving some open for later when demand and profits are higher.\n\nAmadeus\n\nAmadeus is the leading computer reservation system (also called a global distribution system) for the travel industry.\n\nAverage Rate Index (ARI)\n\nARI is a metric used by the hospitality industry to measure whether or not theyâre achieving a sufficient ADR as compared to other hotels in their demographic or market space.\n\nAverage Room Rate (ARR)\n\nARR is a hospitality industry KPI that helps to evaluate the average rate per available extent. Itâs measured by taking the total room income and dividing it by the total rooms engaged.\n\nThis is an essential metric for determining a hotelâs financial success. Itâs also sometimes interchangeable with ADR (average daily rate).\n\nBest Available Rate (BAR)\n\nThe BAR is the absolute best, lowest available rate that can be offered for a room at that particular period of time. The purpose of measuring the BAR for a room is to make payment for hotel rooms less confusing.\n\nThe BAR may also fluctuate according to supply and demand and may vary greatly from day to day.\n\nBooking Engine\n\nA booking engine is an online application that hotels use to process online reservations on their websites and social media sites.\n\nEngine can save you time and money on corporate bookings. Learn more about our booking engine today!\n\nChannel Management\n\nChannel management is the process that hotels use to track the business they do through third-party channels. This means managing their connections with:\n\nOnline travel agents\n\nRetail travel agents\n\nâMeta search engines\n\nAggregators\n\nGlobal distribution systems\n\nCompetitive Set\n\nIn the hotel industry, a competitive set (often shortened to âcomp setâ) is a group of direct competitors that a hotel measures and compares its performance against. Hoteliers use this information to try to make their hotels more competitive in the marketplace.\n\nCentral Reservation System (CRS)\n\nA CRS is a type of reservation system software used to help hotels track inventory, manage guest reservations, and process guest reservations in real time.\n\nDistribution Channels\n\nA hotel distribution channel is any location, either online or offline, where a hotel can sell a room to a customer.\n\nEngine is one example of a distribution channel, as we can facilitate room reservations with over 700,000 different hotels around the world.\n\nTip: When booking travel through a third-party distribution channel, you may find yourself wondering if the website youâre on is a scam. Learn how to spot the signs of fraud in this article: How to Avoid Booking Scams.\n\nGlobal Distribution System (GDS)\n\nGlobal distribution systems serve as a conduit between travel bookers and suppliers.\n\nThese distribution systems provide live information regarding pricing and availability to travel agents and various online booking engines. This helps to facilitate automated transactions.\n\nThe four major legacy GDSs are:\n\nAmadeus\n\nGalileo\n\nSabre\n\nWorldspan\n\nGross Operating Profit Per Available Room (GOPPAR)\n\nGOPPAR is a metric that helps hoteliers to understand how their hotel is performing financially. It compares the hotelâs revenue to its operational performance.\n\nTo figure a hotelâs GOPPAR, divide the gross operating profit by the total number of available rooms.\n\nNet Rate\n\nThe net rate for a hotel room is what a reseller pays for rooms without any commission included.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf a hotel room reseller books a block of hotel rooms at $180 per room at net rate (this means that thereâs no commission), and then resells those rooms for $200 per room, the reseller will net $20 per room, and that will be the total revenue.\n\nOccupancy Rate\n\nA hotelâs occupancy rate is the percentage of rooms that are occupied at any given time.\n\nItâs another key performance indicator, measured by dividing the total number of rooms occupied by the total number of rooms available, then multiplying that number by 100 to create a percentage.\n\nOccupied Room\n\nAn occupied room is a room that a guest has already booked and checked into.\n\nOverbooking\n\nOverbooking is a practice within the hospitality industry in which more rooms are booked out than are available, with that anticipation that a certain number of reservations will be canceled.\n\nHotels overbook to help them ensure that theyâll reach maximum revenue and occupancy.\n\nProperty Management System (PMS)\n\nA PMS is a system that hotels use to manage many of the practical aspects of running a hotel business. Itâs the system used for things like:\n\nBooking reservations\n\nGuest check-ins and check-outs\n\nRoom assignment\n\nManaging room rates\n\nâBilling\n\nRack Rate\n\nThe rack rate is the rate a hotel room is assigned before any discounts are applied. This number is usually set artificially high so that discounts will look especially generous and attractive.\n\nRevenue Management System (RMS)\n\nRevenue management systems are software used by hoteliers to analyze things like:\n\nCompetitor rates\n\nHistoric rates\n\nMarket dynamics\n\nInventory levels\n\nThis helps them predict the demand for each room type, allowing them to adjust their rates for maximum profitability and room revenue.\n\nRevenue Per Available Room (RevPAR)\n\nRevPAR is a metric used in the hospitality industry to measure a hotelâs performance.\n\nYou can calculate RevPAR in two different ways.\n\nMultiply the hotelâs average daily room rate by its occupancy rate.\n\nDivide total room revenue by the total number of rooms available in the measured period.\n\nWalk-In (Or Walk-Up) Rate\n\nThe walk-in price for a hotel room is the same as the rack rate. Itâs a price figure thatâs set artificially high with the expectation that the customer will ask for discounts, use coupons, etc.\n\nYield Management\n\nThis term describes the process of attempting to understand and anticipate customer needs, desires, and behaviors, with the end goal of maximizing revenue and offering better service.\n\nEngine can help you save up to 60% on business lodging at more than 700,000 hotels worldwide.

      "# [7 Productive Things You Can Do on a Business Trip by Audrey Fairbrother on 2022-02-04](https://engine.com/business-travel-guide/business-trip)\nYour next work assignment requires you to head out of town for a few days. Whether itâs via plane, train, or automobile, the end result is usually the same:\n\nYouâre going to have a few days of business meetings mixed with quiet evenings in your hotel room.\n\nYour feelings about business travel depend partly on whether you enjoy traveling.\n\nAre you one of those bit by the traveling bug who flourishes away from home? Or do you prefer the stability of your typical routine?\n\nMaybe you already feel overwhelmed by your schedule. If you do, you probably see the trip as just another task on your to-do list.\n\nThe downtime on your business trip doesnât have to be a waste, though. You can use it productively to forward your personal and/or work goals.\n\nEven if you only have a few minutes of quiet time, try these tips to keep laser-focused on your targets while youâre traveling.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Use Your Devices Productively\n\n2. Passively Invest in Your Future\n\n3. Expand Your Professional Network\n\n4. Plan Your Goals\n\n5. Get Organized\n\n6. Turn Your Trip Into a Learning Experience\n\n7. Improve Your Health\n\n1. Use Your Devices Productively\n\nWe have so many digital devices, itâs hard to narrow down what to pack in our luggage and what to keep handy while weâre traveling.\n\nHow youâre traveling plays a big role in this, though.\n\nGot Windshield Time?\n\nIf youâre driving, you can stay productive with an audiobook.\n\nWhat have you wanted to learn but havenât had time to dig into?\n\nThis âwindshield timeâ is the perfect opportunity for you to learn a new language or embrace your intellectual side.\n\nMaybe youâre not interested in anything using your mind right now, though.\n\nGo ahead and tune the world out with a fluff piece by your favorite fiction writer. Itâs still productive because youâre refreshing your brain, so youâll be ready to work when you get to your destination.\n\nMake the Most of Your Passenger Experience\n\nIf youâre flying or taking a train or bus, you have a lot more options. Since youâre stuck being a passenger and letting someone else control the direction, use your travel time to your advantage.\n\nDo you have some work tasks you could knock out on the computer?\n\nCheck your emails and respond to old messages. Get a headstart on the tripâs agenda by researching the itinerary, guest speakers, or other relevant info.\n\nOr, you could avoid work altogether and start an online course on a subject youâve been dying to explore.\n\nTry a new skill that will boost your chances of furthering your career path, or indulge in something youâre interested in that has nothing to do with your job.\n\nKnowledge is always a good thing!\n\nTip: If your work requires internet, check that the flight has Wi-Fi before you book your ticket. And be sure to pack all of the chargers you need in your carry-on bag!\n\n2. Passively Invest in Your Future\n\nSometimes, you can be productive without doing anything more than what has to be done anyway.\n\nFor instance, while you have a little downtime, research how you can use your current business trip to start preparing for a fun personal getaway.\n\nThe more you plan and take business trips, the more youâll learn about how to take advantage of the benefits. This will help you become strategic in your travel decisions so that you can plan for your future without any effort.\n\nUse Your Work Trip Now to Pay for Future Vacations\n\nDid you get to use a business credit card to book your trip?\n\nWas the hotel or flight booked in your name?\n\nIf you answered yes to either of those questions, you could have travel perks youâre not aware of. Frequent flyer miles and hotel points donât have to be used for a business trip, even if it was your job that sent you there.\n\nYou can upgrade your room or get discounts on your next trip by using your current booking info. If you donât already have one, create an account to add your miles or hotel booking and start earning perks.\n\nâ¦Or Let the Experts Do the Work For You\n\nUnless your company does all the planning and booking, youâre wasting a lot of hours preparing for your trip.\n\nYou want the best deals, but your boss has to approve the itinerary. You canât go over budget, but the one youâre given might not be feasible.\n\nItâs a headache that you can avoid by using a corporate travel service that specializes in planning business trips.\n\nThese companies take your travel plans and turn them into a comprehensive itinerary for you.\n\nBusiness travelers are often entitled to discounts that personal getaways donât qualify for. If you donât know about these price breaks, you canât ask for them. A professional lodging planning company like Engine stays up-to-date on the newest discounts and perks.\n\nPlanning your trip through a travel management company gives you benefits like:\n\nA seamless check-in experience\n\nBusiness-class prices\n\nKnowledge of updated pandemic policies\n\nEasier local and international business trip planning\n\nA dedicated customer support agent to answer all your questions\n\nAdditionally, you get a professional company to deal with the expense management for you. If anything goes wrong, they handle the reimbursement issues and work on the problem until youâre satisfied.\n\nThese companies can give you travel advice to help you plan your trip from start to finish. Theyâre there to simplify your entire travel experience, freeing you up to have more time to invest in your future instead of dealing with travel details.\n\nSave time and money on business lodging when you join Engine!\n\n3. Expand Your Professional Network\n\nYouâre here to meet with other people face-to-face. What better way to expand your network?\n\nNetworking is the key to a successful career. Building professional relationships could also help you in your personal life. You never know who will impact your life or whose life youâll make a difference in.\n\nIf you already have a list of scheduled attendees, you could take the downtime before your meetings to check out their LinkedIn profiles. When you see someone who interests you, highlight them on your list and make it a point to introduce yourself in person.\n\nAs you get to know everyone, think about who would be a great addition to your web of connections. Invite them to dinner or to explore the local sights with you. Chances are, theyâre trying to fill their hours productively just like you.\n\n4. Plan Your Goals\n\nIn the hectic pace of our day-to-day routine, itâs hard to set aside time to plan for the future.\n\nBut the time outside of your business meetings is yours. Youâre alone, and you have no demands. Why not use this time to plan, reassess, or begin working toward your goals?\n\nStarting from scratch can feel overwhelming at first. Before you jump into a list of things you want to do that end up leaving you feeling like youâre slacking, try to pinpoint an area that will increase your productivity.\n\nExamples of these types of targets could be things like:\n\nMoving to a neighborhood closer to your job to cut out driving time\n\nOrganizing your home office if you work remotely (investing in better equipment and furniture, clearing out clutter, etc.)\n\nLearning about and implementing time management techniques, like these tools suggested by Forbes Magazine\n\nTracking and limiting your social media use and time spent on other distractions\n\nAll of these are strong goals that can increase your productivity. Theyâre also targets that can be difficult to think about and implement into a busy day.\n\nNow that you have a little extra free time, set some goals to make your life better when you get back to reality. Set deadlines so you can hold yourself accountable, too.\n\n5. Get Organized\n\nJust as we lack the time to set goals, we donât have a lot of time to get ourselves organized on a daily basis, either. Thus, we often find ourselves running around at the last minute, doing things we know we should have done earlier, putting us behind schedule even more.\n\nYou know that all you need is a few hours to yourself, and you could save tons of time later. So now you have it!\n\nWhat can you organize now, while youâre in the mood to be productive and donât have hundreds of things on your plate?\n\nStraightening Up Your Cluttered Day\n\nYour planner is a great place to start. If you donât have one, now is the time to head to the nearest department store and grab one or download an app.\n\nColor-coding your planner or separating your tasks into categories (work, personal, etc.) might help. If you have a digital app and youâre unsure how to use all of its features, you have some time to read the instructions.\n\nHowâs your inbox looking these days? Do you have dozens (or hundreds) of red circles reminding you that youâre behind? Mark them all as âread,â and start deleting and unsubscribing to anything thatâs a waste of space.\n\nIf you donât already, make use of your emailâs âsnoozeâ feature. Itâs a great way to archive an email you donât have time for right now but need to address at some point. You can snooze it until later and itâll show back up to remind you it needs attention.\n\nAny and all of these are strategic, productive steps to declutter your schedule and add more time to your day. Youâll appreciate the work you put into organizing your life when you get back to the daily grind.\n\n6. Turn Your Trip Into a Learning Experience\n\nAnytime you have the chance to see a new place and learn something new, take it! This is the perfect opportunity to explore a new area and expand your horizons.\n\nCheck out the local sights, including family-owned restaurants and shops. These are often full of culture you donât see in chain stores.\n\nLearning more about the culture and environment of the area can also give you connection points with customers and suppliers from that location. If youâre meeting with someone who lives there, theyâll appreciate that you took the time to get to know their home and market.\n\nPlus, youâll have a common ground to build from. Talking about local restaurants, landmarks, and events is a great way to break the ice.\n\nTake a stroll around the neighborhood or visit the parks and beaches. Grab a brochure off the rack in your hotel to get ideas of popular entertainment in the area.\n\nBig cities like New York almost have too much to do. Check with your booking company or the hotel concierge to get suggestions for must-sees. If you canât squeeze it all into this short trip, use those hotel and travel benefits to come back again!\n\nYou wonât learn anything new sitting around your hotel being bored. But who knows what wonder awaits you in the surrounding city?\n\n7. Improve Your Health\n\nThis trip is an opportunity to take steps toward better physical and mental wellness. By adjusting small habits now, youâll be able to take the changes into your life when youâre back at home.\n\nA lot of people use trips as an excuse to indulge in âvacation food,â paying for it with a foggy brain and upset stomach during an important meeting. Maintaining your health when youâre away on business keeps you in optimal shape to reach your goals for that trip.\n\nIt only takes baby steps to make major strides. Instead of using this trip as an excuse to backslide into unhealthy eating and sleeping patterns, try establishing habits like:\n\nWalking to any destination within a mile or two if you have the time (and making the time whenever possible).\n\nEating a healthy breakfast to start your day.\n\nSetting a wake-up alarm and sticking to a sleep schedule.\n\nDrinking more water instead of soda or other unhealthy beverages.\n\nFilling up on a salad first, opting for grilled instead of fried foods, and picking veggies instead of carbs as your side at restaurants.\n\nThe key to a healthy lifestyle is summed up in one sentence:\n\nChoose what you want most over what you want right now.\n\nItâs a hard thing to remember in the hustle and bustle of a busy schedule. But establishing the habit now, while you have the time, can help you segue it into your âreal lifeâ later.\n\nIf youâre a travel manager, we have tips for you, too! Read our Corporate Travel Manager Productivity Hacks article for advice on how to work more efficiently.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe love business trips. Theyâre an opportunity to step out of your comfort zone, see new places, and get things done.\n\nWith the right mindset and a little bit of preparation, you can use your next business trip to further your career and improve your life!\n\nEngine offers negotiated group rates for all kinds of business travelers.

      "# [9 Corporate Travel Tips For Coordinators by Audrey Fairbrother on 2021-10-24](https://engine.com/business-travel-guide/business-travel)\nEach year, Americans take more than 405 million long-distance business trips. Any corporate travel coordinator will tell you that planning is the key to a successful journey.\n\nPlanning a business trip for your employees is quite different from booking a family vacation.\n\nWeâll take you through the 9 most important tips when booking business travel.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Learn Your Companyâs Travel Policy\n\n2. Determine How Trips Get Paid For\n\n3. Consider Hotel Convenience, Not Just Price\n\n4. Always Earn Rewards\n\n5. Communicate Budgets Ahead Of Time\n\n6. Always Opt For Travel Insurance\n\n7. Check The Cancellation Policy\n\n8. Fill Out The Credit Card Authorization Form\n\n9. Create A Business Travel Checklist For Your Employees\n\n1. Learn Your Companyâs Travel Policy\n\nWhether setting up MICE travel or an out-of-state construction gig, youâll first need to become an expert on your companyâs full travel policy.\n\nFor corporate travel arrangements, you should have answers to questions like:\n\nAre you supposed to choose the hotel room, or can the employees do it themselves?\n\nWill you need to book air travel and car rentals, or can your colleagues do that on their own too?\n\nShould you always make the most economical choice for budget sustainability, or do you have upgrade flexibility?\n\nWill your employees receive a per diem or corporate credit card for travel expenses, or will they cover the costs themselves and get reimbursed later?\n\n2. Determine How Trips Get Paid For\n\nFamiliarize yourself with how your company handles things like:\n\nPer diem\n\nExpenses\n\nReimbursements\n\nReceipts\n\nWe have detailed guides to corporate travel budgets, company mileage policy and reimbursement policies, but here is some of the most important information to keep your upcoming bookings moving.\n\nWhat Qualifies As A Business Travel Expense?\n\nAccording to the IRS, business travel expenses are ordinary and necessary expenses incurred when traveling for your business, job or profession.\n\nOf course, there are different ways to handle record-keeping for expense management. This is something youâll need to discuss with your employees to ensure everyone is following the same systems.\n\nHow Per Diem Makes Things Easier\n\nOnce youâve gotten a handle on what constitutes proper business travel expenses, the next step is to figure out how you allow your employees to actually spend.\n\nYou can have them use a company credit card to cover expenses, or have them submit receipts after the fact for reimbursement. But if you have several employees away for long periods, reconciling receipts to specific trips gets complicated.\n\nPer diem solves that issue by giving employees a set allowance for travel spending. This can be applied to hotel bookings, airfare, carshare, etc.\n\nIf they want to go over their per diem amount on their expenses, thatâs up to them, knowing that theyâll pay the difference.\n\nOn top of per diem, you might consider offering an additional travel allowance to use on things like fancy dinners, attractions, tours, etc. â particularly for longer trips.\n\nThis all depends on how your company wants to handle business travel management and how (or if) they allocate funds for leisure.\n\nRead more: Per Diem And Taxes: Top 7 Frequently Asked Questions (With Answers)\n\n3. Consider Hotel Convenience, Not Just Price\n\nYou might look for inexpensive rooms to ensure affordable and sustainable business travel.\n\nBut cheaper doesnât always mean better. Itâs possible to balance the best hotel chains prices and amenities.\n\nWhile your employees donât always need an oceanfront view or a penthouse suite at the best downtown hotel, you still need to make sure theyâre in a convenient location near your local office or job site. Opting for a place with a free breakfast isnât a bad idea, either.\n\nBesides a more comfortable experience for your colleagues, your company will also avoid paying for off-site daily breakfasts at restaurants and expensive hotel-to-office commutes.\n\nIn a city like New York, for example, placing workers in Manhattan business hotels means they wonât even need to rent a car.\n\n4. Always Earn Rewards\n\nA general rule of thumb with credit cards is to always make sure theyâre giving you something back, like reward points.\n\nThatâs especially true with business travel expenses, where credit card spending is ubiquitous.\n\nHotel chains and airlines have their own credit cards, offering free or discounted nights and flights after a certain number of purchases. Credit card companies also offer their own general âmilesâ cards that can be redeemed on a more flexible list of brands, like this travel credit card from Discover.\n\nCredit cards aside, major hotel chains always have loyalty programs allowing you to earn points with each stay. Regardless of the payment method, you can build up these points and cash them in on free rooms.\n\nThatâs why itâs a good idea to pick a hotel chain that you and your employees like, create a loyalty account, and whenever possible, book with their properties. Your points will stack up much faster than if you book with a variety of brands.\n\nHE Rewards\n\nThe rewards get even better if your employees are booking rooms through Engine.\n\nYouâll keep earning those credit card miles. And, if youâre in a hotelâs travel program (or your employees already are), youâll be able to keep earning those points with our online booking tool.\n\nBut youâll also earn points directly through Engine.\n\nWith HE Rewards, youâll accumulate points on every stay you book. The more you book, the faster youâll earn â and then you can cash in those points for discounted rooms or even free nights.\n\n5. Communicate Budgets Ahead Of Time\n\nIf you give your employees per diem, theyâre free to use a travel booking platform to select either less-expensive rooms in hotel chains or upgrade them to business suites (if they have room under that cap). But in some cases, workers may be unable to choose their own upgrades without a boss signing off on the decision.\n\nIf your employees are booking rooms via company credit card rather than per diem, you can set set caps on the nightly rates they can reserve on Engine. That way, there is no need to worry about rates over a certain price point getting booked without prior approval.\n\n6. Always Opt For Travel Insurance\n\nTravel insurance is insurance that covers any costs of losses associated with travel. This includes coverage for emergency medical benefits, as well as cancellation fees.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by the insurance company Battleface, almost 50% of Americans have had to absorb fees, costs and losses associated with travel because they were uninsured.\n\nFrom a risk management standpoint, itâs always worth the few extra dollars of a travel insurance policy for your employees. Especially in a large corporation. With the pandemic not entirely over, trip cancellations are a reality, not a hypothetical.\n\nTravel policies for all traveling employees add up to less than eating the costs of no-show business trips.\n\n7. Check The Cancellation Policy\n\nEven if you buy the best travel insurance, always check the hotelâs cancellation policy before clicking âBook.â They often vary not just by chain, but by room type too!\n\nItâs best to have both insurance and a flexible cancellation policy to mitigate all potential travel risks. Insurance typically requires a qualifying reason if you suddenly need to cancel; âOur meeting got rescheduledâ wonât do.\n\nBut if youâre still within the hotelâs cancellation policy, youâll be able to change or remove the booking for any reason.\n\nIf the hotel requires a weekâs notice and your employee has a family emergency two days before, the insurance kicks in. But if youâre still within the cancellation window, itâs easier to just cancel rather than submit a claim.\n\nIf you select the Flex option during checkout on Engine, you donât even have to worry about every hotelâs cancellation policy!\n\nYouâll be able to cancel a room up until noon on the day of check-in and get your funds back. You can even cut a trip short mid-stay and only pay for the nights you use.\n\n8. Fill Out The Credit Card Authorization Form\n\nGet these out of the way early! You donât want to risk an employee not being able to check in because the authorization form was not submitted in advance.\n\nAs is common in business travel, the person with the credit card who paid for the room is not always the person staying in the hotel. Travel industry vendors need this form to ensure that any incidentals the guest charges to the room are allowed.\n\nIf your company qualifies for Direct Bill with Engine, credit card authorization forms are a thing of the past. You can add Incidentals Coverage at checkout, and Engine will simply add any room charges to your regular invoice.\n\n9. Create A Business Travel Checklist For Your Employees\n\nNow that your bookings are complete and reservation details have been handed out, itâs a good idea to compile a checklist for your employees.\n\nIn addition to their toothbrush and other obvious travel must-haves, there are some things that you wouldnât need on a vacation that are important for a business trip, like a laptop, business attire, a corporate credit card and a clothing steamer, to name a few.\n\nDepending on your field, other items might be required too â like scrubs for travel nurses or protective shoes for construction workers.\n\nSend out this basic checklist a week or two before departure day so your employees have time to pack, and work doesnât get held up because of a forgotten item.\n\nConclusion\n\nOnce youâve got these nine details squared away, your employees should be all set for their next business travel trips.\n\nYouâll also want to sign up for free with Engine, the lodging performance network built to handle all these tasks. Unlike other travel sites, weâre designed for business travelers, so weâre always thinking ahead.\n\nContact us online to learn more about how we can help with your companyâs unique travel needs.\n\nâFrequently Asked Questions\n\n1. How can corporate travelers make the most out of their travel budget?\n\nCorporate travelers can maximize their travel budget by using loyalty programs and reward points offered by hotels and airlines. Additionally, opting for a per diem system simplifies expense management and ensures budget adherence. Booking accommodations in convenient locations can also reduce costs related to transportation and meals, providing a more efficient use of the travel budget.\n\n2. What are some essential corporate travel tips for new business travelers?\n\nFor new business travelers, itâs important to familiarize yourself with your company's travel policy and understand the process for booking flights, hotels, and car rentals. Always opt for travel insurance to safeguard against unexpected changes, and ensure all travel arrangements are made using credit cards that offer reward points. Lastly, keep a travel checklist to ensure you pack all necessary items for your business trip.\n\n3.

This is especially important in our current post-pandemic environment.\n\nFor an in-depth look at how to conduct trip risk assessments to ensure your teamâs well-being, read this: Full Guide to Trip Risk Assessments to Keep Employees Safe.\n\n4. A Well-Planned Travel Budget\n\nCreating a travel budget is essential.\n\nAfter all, you donât just need to make ends meet on business trips â you also want to turn a profit.\n\nTo do this while making sure that your team has everything they need on the road, you must create a detailed plan for how and where you plan to allocate travel budget funds.\n\nFor additional information, read this post: How to Create an Employee Travel Budget for Small Businesses.\n\n5. Taxes\n\nIn order to avoid tax issues later on, you must understand your companyâs tax responsibilities as they pertain to your travel spend.\n\nItâs also important to make sure that your employees understand how your company handles certain tax-related issues:\n\nPer diem\n\nReimbursements\n\nHow to record business travel expenditures\n\nHow to keep track of expenses and receipts using the accountable method\n\nTo learn more about what employers should know about per diem and employee rights, check out this post: What Employers Should Know About Per Diem and Employee Rights.\n\nYou can also learn how to plan a meal allowance for employees, including information about meal stipends, in this post: How to Plan a Meal Allowance for Employees.\n\nTracking Travel Expenses\n\nGetting your employees to track travel expenses while theyâre out in the field is an awesome way to avoid tax issues with per diem and itemized write-offs later on in the season.\n\nBut unfortunately, figuring out how to record this crucial travel data without bogging down your team can be a nightmare.\n\nEngine is a free-to-use platform designed to solve this problem for you.

When you issue a great travel reward credit card to everyone on your team, you earn valuable points that you can cash in for things like flights, rooms, meals, bonuses, etc.\n\nHereâs a list of some of the best credit card plans to choose from, as well as some tips on how to pick the right one: How to Choose Your Travel Rewards Credit Cards.\n\n6. Transportation\n\nWhenever you plan to travel, transportation is obviously a big issue. In other words, your team needs flights, rental cars, etc.\n\nSome companies use a travel management company (TMC) or travel agent for this.\n\nBut other companies see to the task on their own.\n\nIn any case, here are some important details to keep in mind:\n\nFlights\n\nOne of the most valuable skills to learn in the travel industry is how to book the best flights at the best prices.\n\nNavigating the airport terminal without getting needlessly bogged down is another valuable.

But you can also source your own car rentals, and there are many ways to save money while doing it.\n\nFor example, you might sign up for a car rental reward program to save money and earn rewards on rentals.\n\nRideshare/Taxis\n\nSometimes, rather than renting a vehicle, it makes more sense to simply find a taxi or rideshare option to shuttle you from place to place.\n\nIn such cases, finding the best deal (and the best service) is imperative.\n\nUber and Lyft are usually the two most common rideshare services that new travel professionals utilize when working on location.\n\nYou can read customer testimonials on most rideshare mobile apps to get a feel for whether or not that particular service can meet your needs.\n\nGas Mileage\n\nIf your employees are driving their own vehicles or renting one for the duration of the trip, you need to factor in gas mileage expenses.\n\nNowadays, this is especially important, as gas prices are rising in many parts of the country.\n\nIf you need some help figuring out how to deal with rising fuel prices, read our guide on adjusting company mileage policies when gas prices skyrocket.\n\nFlight Mileage\n\nRacking up frequent flier miles can sometimes help you unlock big-time savings, rewards, and bonuses when flying.\n\nBut hereâs the thing:\n\nSometimes, these programs end up costing you more than they earn you.\n\nTo avoid running into this problem, follow these tips:\n\nMake sure to redeem your miles before they expire\n\nMake sure that you understand how your miles and bonuses work so that you can take full advantage of them\n\nKeep an eye out for limited-time deals\n\nInternational Corporate Travel\n\nInternational travel opens up a few more complex issues than domestic travel.\n\nTo fully prepare for a work trip overseas, take a look at this international travel checklist to help you remember all of the most important details.\n\n7. Lodging\n\nBooking high-quality yet affordable lodging is a crucial step toward meeting your travel goals.\n\nHere are some things youâll need to think about in regard to lodging for business travel:\n\nHotels or Short-Term Housing?\n\nIf you plan to stay somewhere for less than 30 days, youâll usually want to consider either a traditional or extended stay hotel.\n\nBut if you plan to stay for 30 days or more, you may want to look into some short-term rental options.\n\nCorporate Housing\n\nCorporate housing is a term used to describe a short-term rental sourced by a company for employees whoâll need a place to live while working on location for an extended period of time.\n\nCheck out this guide to learn how to find the right corporate lodging solution for your company: How to Find the Right Corporate Lodging Solution for Your Construction Teams.\n\nGroup Hotel Bookings\n\nGroup hotel bookings happen when a company reserves more than one room together for the same booking period.\n\nThis is useful when you need to place a whole team on location, as group bookings can help you get the best deal.\n\nWriting and Submitting Hotel RFPs\n\nAn RFP is a request for proposal. Itâs essentially a request for hospitality companies to submit a proposal for a group booking of rooms and/or meeting space.\n\nLearn how to write and submit one here: How to Write and Submit a Hotel RFP.\n\nYou can also check out our hotel RFP guide to learn about some tools that will help you with this task.\n\nWhat Kind of Stay to Look For\n\nWhen booking hotels for different periods of time, itâs always a good idea to understand the difference between the various types of stays.\n\nFor a full glossary of stay terms, check out this helpful guide: What Kind of Stay Do You Need?

      "# [How to Write and Submit a Hotel RFP [for SMBs] by Audrey Fairbrother on 2023-07-10](https://engine.com/business-travel-guide/hotel-rfp)\nBefore you can send your team out traveling, you need to book blocks of hotel rooms for them. And booking group stays can be complicated â you'll most likely need to submit an RFP to several hotels first.\n\nIf it's your first time booking a hotel for a group or drafting a hotel RFP â or if you just don't know what \"RFP\" means â we're here to help.\n\nLet's learn about hotel RFPs, why they're important, and how to get great rates for all your group hotel stays without extra hassle.\n\nWe'll cover:\n\n1. What an RFP is\n\n2. Why you'd submit an RFP\n\n3. The 6 steps involved in every RFP\n\n4. How to avoid the hassle of RFPs altogether\n\nWhat is an RFP?\n\nRFP stands for \"Request For Proposal.\" A hotel RFP, then, is a way to let hotels know what you're looking for as you plan an upcoming stay. That might mean:\n\nNumber of rooms\n\nLength of stay\n\nExpected number of guests\n\nDesired amenities\n\nMeeting space requirements, etc.\n\nTravel managers, event planners and other people who book corporate travel use RFPs to start the negotiating process.\n\nWhy submit an RFP?\n\nIf you're new to this process, you might be wondering: Why would you submit an RFP to a hotel when you could just as easily book rooms for your company through a travel management company or online travel agency?\n\nIt's an excellent question â especially if you haven't considered the pros and cons of TMCs and OTAs. Ultimately, RFPs are specifically for group hotel bookings, which are often too hard or too expensive to book with OTAs or TMCs.\n\nThink of each RFP as an open request for bids from different hotels, intended to help you get theâ¯best price on event venues, meeting rooms and room blocks.\n\nRemember: Hotels know that if youâre sending them an RFP, you're probably sending it to other hotels, too â so they're incentivized to offer a competitive rate.\n\nHow do I create an RFP? (6 Steps)\n\nThere are plenty of RFP tools and software solutions intended to help, but there's actually a much better way to handle hotel RFPs.\n\nIt's very simple. The trick is: don't bother with them.\n\nInstead, book group trips with Engine. Engine is not an OTA or a TMC, and our best-in-class platform and expert Groups team make group hotel bookings effortless.\n\nAnd hereâs the best part: it's free.\n\nIf you're determined to handle RFPs on your own instead, hereâs a rundown of the 6 steps involved.\n\nStep #1: Gather the Required Info\n\nFirst you'll need to compile all your travel requirements, like:\n\nDesired number of rooms\n\nThe dates that you'll require the rooms\n\nSpecific amenities that you need or prefer\n\nRequirements for any meeting spaces (if needed)\n\nSpecifics for the types of rooms/beds your travelers prefer\n\nAny additional concessions you may desire, such as room upgrades, premium amenities, etc.\n\nStep #2: Research Hotel Options\n\nNext, you'll need to compile a list of hotels to send your RFP to. This step is time-consuming, and a major reason why RFPs can be overwhelming. Make sure you leave yourself enough time to truly consider your options.\n\nStart with a geographic search of the area for hotels that could potentially meet your company's travel needs for this specific trip. Take note of whether each hotel has the amenities and event space you require.\n\nOnce you've created a list, itâs time to start writing and submitting proposals. We recommend starting with around 5 options. Too few and you may find yourself beginning your search all over again down the line.\n\nStep #3: Write Up Your RFP\n\nHereâs the information you should include in your request:\n\nA Brief Intro to Yourself and Your Company\n\nFor example: your name, company name, your contact information, and any other industry or mission information that may help the hotel understand who you are.\n\nA Complete Event Profile and Description\n\nUse the list of requirements you put together above, plus crucial information like planned attendance, dates of stay, date of the event(s), space requirements, amenities you're interested in (or need), and budget guidelines, which may help you avoid more back-and-forth with the hotel than necessary.\n\nRelated: How to Create an Employee Travel Budget for a Small Business\n\nA Deadline for Proposal Response\n\nMake sure you set a deadline for the hotels so that you get responses back promptly. Also, try to submit your RFP early, since complex hotel bookings take time to coordinate.The more complex your request, the sooner you should turn your RFP in to hotels. Give them plenty of time to deal with the request and reply with a bid before your deadline hits, and you'll ensure you have multiple bids to compare.\n\nStep #4: Submit Your Hotel RFPs\n\nSubmitting your RFPs also takes a bit of legwork. For best results, contact all of your chosen hotels directly to ask them where and how to submit your paperwork. Otherwise, you may not get a response.\n\nNowadays, most RFPs are submitted to hotel sales agents via email, but some hotels may have a different policy.\n\nReminder: You can bypass all of this work by partnering with Engine. Learn how ourâ¯group booking serviceâ¯can save you time (and money!) today.\n\nStep #5: Review and Negotiate\n\nIf a hotel can reasonably meet your request and budget guidelines, they'll follow up with their own proposal for you to look over.\n\nIt's important to review their proposals carefully. Make sure that the bid meets your company's requirements, travelers' needs, and trip/event budget.\n\nIf not, it's time to negotiate.\n\nNegotiation is common with hotel RFPs. While negotiating, you'll go back and forth with the booking agent as you try to work out a compromise.\n\nMake sure you field bids from many different hotels. Having alternative offers will provide you with bargaining power and enable you to get the best possible price.\n\nWith that in mind, set aside a good amount of time for this step of the process. There will likely be a lot of back-and-forth.\n\nStep #6: Book & Modify\n\nOnce you've selected a hotel and negotiated a suitable rate, it's time to finalize the booking with the hotel representative managing your proposal.\n\nThey'll send a contract, which you should review carefully. (We have a whole section on understanding important contract clauses in our e-book \"How to Make Group Hotel Booking Ridiculously Simple.\")\n\nOnce you've reviewed your contract and approved it (or requested changes from the hotel), you'll submit payment and get confirmation. Congratulations: your lodging is booked!\n\nNow you can turn your attention to managing the trip through check-in, check-out and reconciliation.\n\nFor modifications, you'll need to contact the hotel directly. The front desk will handle any changes you need to make to your booking, such as guest list or itinerary changes.\n\nOf course, you also have access to a faster, easier way to get great group lodging at a great negotiated rate, with white-glove service on modifications that eliminates those hotel phone calls. Â Enjoy easier-than-ever reconciliation with the ability to consolidate room charges and choose from flexible payment options thanks to Direct Bill, along with on-demand access to individual hotel folios and customized reporting.\n\nAnd because our platform is free to use, with no subscriptions or commitments or minimum spending required, you've got nothing to lose in giving it a try.\n\nHow to Avoid the Hassle of RFPs with Engine\n\nGuess what?

      "# [7 Convenient (and Underused) Hotel Services and Amenities by Audrey Fairbrother on 2021-10-25](https://engine.com/travel-trends-tech/hotel-services)\nThe modern traveler wants to get the most value for their dollar.\n\nThis means that hotels have to either keep their rates competitive or provide the types of amenities that justify a higher price tag.\n\nFor business travelers, those amenities can be the key to a comfortable and convenient trip. But they can sometimes be missed altogether.\n\nSo how can you be sure youâre making the most of your travel budget?\n\nThe key may very well be hiding in these underused services and amenities, which most guests forget to ask about.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Transportation\n\n2. Healthy Dining Fare (or In-Room Kitchens)\n\n3. Next-Level Loyalty Programs\n\n4. Travel Services\n\n5. Delivery Services\n\n6. Hi-Technology\n\n7. Multiple-Room Suites\n\n1. Transportation\n\nTraveling is much more enjoyable when you have a way to get around the city youâre staying in. Hotels know this, which is why many of them offer their guests various transportation options.\n\nThese options usually vary depending on the location and type of lodging. Higher-end hotels in big cities often have the most variety.\n\nIndependent hotels, lesser-known locales, or bed and breakfast types are limited in the services they can offer. Even if hotel management wants to offer more, some options just arenât available in a small town.\n\nStill, you can expect to see an assortment of transportation options beyond the typical driver courtesy coach.\n\nDepending on the needs of you and/or your team, check for hotels that offer:\n\nHotel buses or vans\n\nRideshare discounts for affiliated companies\n\nBike and scooter rentals\n\nLimousine services for VIP guests\n\nIf your travelers need a way to get to their business meetings, on-site transportation amenities are essential. It also helps them feel independent and not âstuckâ in their hotel.\n\nFor guests who do rent a car, ask about the car park and valet services. Many hotels, especially in major locations like New York City, charge extra for both of these (which can be a big unexpected hit to your travel budget).\n\nAs important as transportation is, it remains an underused service in the hotel industry.\n\nEngine can help you find the best hotels at the best rates. Learn how our group booking service can help you score corporate hotel discounts at more than 700,000 hotels worldwide!\n\n2. Healthy Dining Fare (or In-Room Kitchens)\n\nA lot of people are trying to eat healthier these days. But on the road, itâs often difficult to find enjoyable yet nutritious and affordable meals.\n\nItâs even harder to find options when youâre on a restrictive diet, such as vegan or gluten-free.\n\nIf youâre a traveler on a healthy diet or a manager who wants to give your team plenty of options, you should consider this when booking hotels.\n\nEating Healthy on a Trip\n\nHotels that provide healthy meal alternatives are always a nice surprise. However, if youâre staying more than a night or two, the costs add up.\n\nWellness perks are becoming a major trend in the hotel industry. Guests will find a lot more amenities geared toward healthy living, like upgraded fitness centers.\n\nStill, nutritious food isnât always cheap.\n\nBut your team can save money by dining in.\n\nInstead of spending half of their budget on meals, savvy travelers are seeking out lodging with in-room kitchens. They donât have to leave the hotel to find food that suits their diet, itâs convenient, and it saves a lot of money on dining out or room service.\n\nRelated: 11+ Healthy Travel Tips for Business Trips\n\n3. Next-Level Loyalty Programs\n\nSome major chain hotels have loyalty programs to try to entice guests to come back for repeat business.\n\nThis âloyaltyâ still depends on the perks. If there isnât anything special to convince the guest to come back to the hotel â and they can get a cheaper room down the street â theyâll go with the lower rate.\n\nThis âguest factâ has many lodging businesses stepping up their loyalty programs.\n\nCommon (and Not-So-Common) Loyalty Perks\n\nAirlines offer frequent flyer miles, and hotels give guests frequent visitor accommodation perks. To make sure you take advantage of these benefits, read the fine print on the website or in the brochure that came with your membership.\n\nYouâll see common perks of loyalty programs, like discounted rates, extra pillows, and upgraded Wi-Fi. But in an increasingly saturated hospitality industry, itâs the not-so-common features that set certain hotels apart.\n\nEarning and Redeeming Points\n\nBefore you start working toward earning points for perks, check to see if the hotel has a specific credit card you can use. By signing up for the card, you may be eligible for a host of other benefits, like extra points, free rooms, and discounts on fuel.\n\nSome hotels have loyalty points that can be redeemed at hotel gift shops and on-site dining venues.\n\nPremium guests can relax and get pampered in the hotelâs lounge area or enjoy preferred seating in the on-site restaurant. If pampering is your goal, search out âspasâ as a luxury hotel amenity. Then, see if the loyalty program for that company gives massage or other spa credits.\n\nâFollow Us on Our Social Mediaâ\n\nWhen you become a member of a hotelâs loyalty program, go ahead and follow them on social media. They may offer complimentary upgrades if you say you saw an ad on their feed.\n\nSome businesses have occasional contests or perks they only advertise for a limited time on their social platforms.\n\nDonât forget to check in with the hotel once every few months to see how their perks have changed. Youâll be amazed at the awards you can compile for staying loyal to a company.\n\n4. Travel Services\n\nFor people who stay at hotels once in a while, itâs not a big deal to log into a fare-finder and book a room for their trip.\n\nHowever, repeat travelers and businesses with a lot of traveling employees need better options.\n\nIf youâre not using one already, youâre missing out on the time and cost benefits that come with services like Engine.\n\nBenefits of Lodging Performance Networks\n\nTravel managers must ensure that their employeesâ travel arrangements are aligned with the company travel policy. Every trip starts with a request for travel dates and ends when the expense report is finalized.\n\nThe job can involve hours spent calling hotels and trying to negotiate the best rates and integral amenities.\n\nBut the entire process is streamlined when you use a lodging performance network (LPN) like Engine.\n\nPutting your employeesâ hotel accommodations in expert hands nets your company benefits like:\n\nAn all-in-one centralized booking process\n\nIncidental coverage programs that reduce employee issues at check-in\n\nStreamlined billing services (pay one monthly invoice instead of many).\n\nSpecialized and saved search filters for employee preferences\n\nA storage and organization system for folios and statements\n\nSignificant savings on travel budgets and planning time\n\nIf you havenât tried an LPN in your travel planning process yet, be sure to check it out!\n\nLearn more about how Engine's Lodging Performance Network can help you save time and money on travel management!\n\n5. Delivery Services\n\nYouâve spent all day at your meeting or at an on-site project. The last thing you want to do is to shop, but thereâs nothing you feel like eating at the hotel.\n\nWhatâs a tired worker to do?\n\nIf youâre staying at a hotel that offers delivery services (or partners with stores that do), all you have to do is place an order!\n\nHotels Partnering With Delivery Companies\n\nWyndham and DoorDash were some of the first widely known hotel discount partnerships. Guests at Wyndham get reduced rates and zero delivery fees if they order through the worldwide delivery company.\n\nSince this announcement back in 2019, other lodging businesses have jumped on board. Theyâve partnered with DoorDash, UberEats, and InstaCart to offer guests this coveted amenity.\n\nNow, partnerships with a variety of delivery companies are a regular perk of staying at certain hotels, including Hilton and other major names. However, if guests donât ask, they donât always know the amenity is available.\n\n6. Hi-Technology\n\nIn a world that seems to be almost entirely digital, itâs not asking too much to expect technology to make your stay easier. To stay relevant in the industry, lodging businesses have to upgrade their tech levels regularly.\n\nTechnology can be the type of convenient amenity that encourages guests to come back in the future.\n\nHi-Tech Hotels\n\nContactless check-in is a must in todayâs post-pandemic world. But other technological amenities make a big difference in guest services, too.\n\nFor instance, what kind of charging accessories are available if the guest forgets or loses theirs?\n\nIs there complimentary Wi-Fi for everyone, or only for elite members?\n\nIs there a business center with computers available to access the internet or print documents?\n\nPersonalized service comes from the hotel platforms, too. The right program can record individual guestâs preferences, such as whether theyâre an Apple/Mac or Android user. Guests can request upgrades to faster Wi- Fi, laptop rentals, and other tech needs.\n\nWith a corporate travel tool like Engine, the employee or travel manager can tell the hotel ahead of time about these preferences.\n\nRelated: How to Find the Best Hotel for the Value\n\n7. Multiple-Room Suites\n\nAre you a light sleeper or someone who prefers privacy? Will you be in your hotel long enough to benefit from a separate kitchen and/or living area?\n\nIf so, check into lodging businesses that offer suites. These enhanced accommodations are usually only a few dollars more. If thereâs an extra guest room and the travelers donât mind, travel managers could save money by booking two people in one suite.\n\nWhy Opt for a Suite?\n\nTravelers that are staying for longer periods will appreciate the extra space to make their rooms feel homier. Suites usually include a living area with a TV and a video console. Hotel guests may be able to upgrade to more TV channels or streaming services, available for free in some five-star lodgings.\n\nBusiness travelers who stay in suites have more workspace. The kitchen and living room tables double as laptop areas.\n\nA hotel room with kitchen features, like a fridge, is great. But a suite brings the comforts of home on the road with you. Everything you need to cook your meals and save money is on hand, from the stove and coffeemaker to the utensils, cookware, and dishes.\n\nFrom the privacy to the convenience, a hotel suite is worth the extra cost. Before you book, ask if the hotel facilities include suites. If you already booked, when you check in, ask guest services if you can bump up your stay to a suite.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhether youâre booking on behalf of an employee or youâre traveling yourself, comfort is important and makes for a more productive trip.\n\nWith these lesser-known amenities and services, you and your team will be able to make the most of your time in any lodging!\n\nBook through Engine and save up to 60% on business lodging for your next adventure!\n\nâ",
      "# [Virtual Accounts vs. Business Credit Cards for Expenses by Cara Meglio on 2022-03-02](https://engine.com/business-travel-guide/virtual-account)\nFrom gas cards to debit cards linked to different accounts, youâre trying to do the smart thing and earn points and rewards. Yet, keeping track of them is exhausting.\n\nNow that virtual accounts are the next hot thing in financial tech, it can be even more difficult to chart expenses.\n\nBut if you can nail down a process, the rewards and benefits are truly advantageous.\n\nHereâs how to use business cards and virtual accounts to pay for things, like hotel bookings, and easily track your expenses.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. What Are Virtual Accounts?\n\n2. Using Business Cards to Pay Your Way\n\n3. Streamlining Your Processes\n\n4. Simplifying Your Expense Charting\n\n5. Layering Your Rewards with Engine\n\n1. What Are Virtual Accounts?\n\nAds for virtual cards are dominating online searches and spam mail. These arenât credit cards in the traditional sense. Theyâre a new type of payment option called a virtual account.\n\nIn the simplest definition, these companies offer users a virtual credit card. The card user gets a randomly generated number that lets them make their purchase.\n\nSince this number is 16 digits and associated with the userâs bank account, itâs treated as a typical credit card by the receiving party.\n\nBenefits of Virtual Account Management (VAM)\n\nThis may sound like a hassle for people who love the ease of storing their card info on their browser for one-click buying.\n\nIf itâs already connected to your bank account, and the money comes out directly, whatâs the point?\n\nIncreased Security\n\nInterested in protecting your assets? Isnât everybody?\n\nYouâll appreciate the extra security a virtual card provides. Itâs especially helpful for business owners who have lots of hands in the pot of money, such as those who have to book hotel rooms for dozens of employees.\n\nInstead of providing every service or lender with the same information, use unique virtual accounts. Each payment has a distinct credit card ID that you can only use once. Should any of the recipients get hacked, the card wonât work for a second transaction.\n\nNo More Fraud (Well, Almost None)\n\nWhile we live in an era where fraudulent charges can get fixed quickly, itâs still a hassle. Then, you have to cancel the card and start over with all your purchases and payments anyway.\n\nUsing a virtual card number almost eliminates the chances of someone else getting access to it and making other purchases. Almost.\n\nAlthough thereâs a very slim possibility that this can happen with a virtual card, thereâs still the major benefit of its unique ID. Tracing the breach back to its source is simple because there was only one point of purchase.\n\nCash Flow Tracking\n\nCompanies use this same idea to track their expenses and receivables. It can be time-consuming and difficult to verify incoming and outgoing payments when itâs all stemming from the same bank account.\n\nWith virtual credit cards, all you need is the order number or the card ID, and you can quickly see the charges and when they happened. The reconciliation processes of your account statements are much simpler.\n\nVirtual Cards to the Rescue\n\nHereâs an example. Youâre a business owner who is sending dozens of employees to a conference. Each employee is booking their own transportation, but the company is paying.\n\nGiving them all the same card information is a massive security and logistic nightmare.\n\nWho knows where theyâll store the info, and who will see it? What kind of protection do they have on their computers? Will their personal device get hacked? When will they make the purchase? Who still hasnât booked yet two days before the trip?\n\nVirtual card management answers every question. It doesnât matter who sees a card that can only be used once. If itâs hacked, it can be traced back. And you can quickly look at your physical account to see which cards are still open to see who hasnât used theirs yet.\n\nTracking your cash flow and expenses through a virtual account number saves time and potential headaches. Confidently hand over a one-time card to others and delegate tasks that wouldâve fallen in your lap previously.\n\nEngineâs Direct Bill Program\n\nNeed to solve payment and fraud issues when booking lodging for your team?\n\nEngine offers Direct Billing, which covers your teamâs lodging and incidentals through a virtual credit card, and gives you one centralized invoice at the end of the month!\n\nWhen you have to set up your employees with hotel rooms frequently, youâre spending a lot of hours inserting credit card numbers online or via fax and hoping the other partyâs server is secure enough to protect against fraud.\n\nAnd if the business card is declined for any reason when the employee tries to check-in, they arenât happy that they have to use their personal card.\n\nAll of these problems become obsolete when you use Engineâs Direct Bill Program.\n\nThis convenient feature sets your company up with a virtual account that can be used to book hotel rooms. The typical âcredit card holdingâ that is normally required upon check-in becomes this virtual account.\n\nEssentially, the program extends you a line of credit to be used for hotel rooms and incidentals. Youâre then billed monthly for the charges applied to the virtual card rather than paying for each individual hotel stay.\n\nKeeping track of lodging for employees who can be sent all over the world becomes streamlined. And since the account is one virtual number, you donât have to worry about fraudulent charges.\n\nRelated: 5 Best Tips for Avoiding Fraud While Booking Travel\n\n2. Using Business Cards to Pay Your Way\n\nAnother option companies have to cut down security risks and make expense tracking easier is a business card. Itâs a helpful financial service offered by lenders or banks designed just for companies.\n\nThe card is still connected to your commercial banking account. However, the features can be geared toward the business needs of your company.\n\nBenefits of Business Cards\n\nAs with a virtual account, you can set up multiple card numbers to use for tracking expenses. For instance, you can use one card for company bills, another for gas purchases, and a third for employee use only.\n\nConsider the same scenario we mentioned above. Youâre sending your employees off to book their own travel again, but this time, theyâre using a business credit card.\n\nThe security risk is still a bit higher than it would be with a virtual card. Yet, this card has its own identifier for tracking.\n\nExtended Employee Freedom\n\nYou can use business cards multiple times without worrying about an interest rate or dealing with credit card payments. So, when youâre sending your employees off to do work, you can also give them their own company credit card.\n\nThey have extra freedom, with limits. You donât have to reimburse them for expenses on the trip or deal with the per diem paperwork hassle.\n\nYou can track expenses in real-time, as you would with transaction banking. It opens the door to other cash management options that take away your essential role in otherwise easy-to-delegate tasks.\n\nYou get a little extra time freedom with a business card, too. You donât have to micromanage every transaction and come up with a new virtual card for each travel need. Unlike with a virtual account management solution, youâre giving the employee the use of one card to cover the tripâs expenses.\n\nPoints and Rewards\n\nRight now, many business owners like to keep their travel booking expenses in-house for reward purposes. When an employee makes the initial payment and gets reimbursed, the company loses out on those points and rewards.\n\nYou can set up business cards and virtual account structures to connect to your loyalty number. When you give your workers their payment info, the counterparties automate the information and apply the appropriate rewards to your number.\n\nAccruing rewards and points in the act of paying expenses and booking has never been easier.\n\nLayering Discounts\n\nPoints are a smart way to layer discounts in future bookings for lodging and other travel expenses.\n\nYour businessâs credit or virtual card collects points with purchases. By using separate, trackable identifiers, these are streamlined into your enterprise resource planning system (ERP).\n\nThe next time you plan a trip, meal, or other work-related purchase, you can use your ERP to see at a glance where you have accrued points. Then, you can use them before they expire.\n\nLayering In Action\n\nLetâs apply layering to our hypothetical employee trip. Your team has their credit card info in hand (virtual or business). Theyâve handled their transportation, and theyâre ready to book their lodging now.\n\nInstead of grabbing the reins back so you can collect reward points and get discounts, you send everyone to Engine. The corporate travel booking platform includes HE Rewards.\n\nHE Rewards is an in-platform program that lets members collect points for every booking. You can apply these points like cash to future stays, with no blackout dates.\n\nAt the same time, members add their brand-specific loyalty information, such as their Hilton Honors reward number. Every booking made through Engine gives you your hotel loyalty points and the Engineâs rewards.\n\nItâs double the rewards on every purchase, and you didnât have to do any of the work!\n\nRead more about Engineâs Hotel Loyalty Program here.\n\nRelated: How to Choose Your Travel Rewards Credit Cards\n\n3. Streamlining Your Processes\n\nUsing business credit cards can clean up the gaps in your current processes that are costing you time and money.\n\nIf you prefer virtual accounts, integrate your VAM solution to connect to your credit card information instead of your in-house bank account. Now, you get the benefits of both.\n\nThis form of expense management will:\n\nLet you set up recurring expenses and receipts\n\nCollect and track outgoing payments\n\nDecrease the time spent on receivables management\n\nMake it easier to create sub-ledgers to analyze your budget\n\nGive you a quick visual of payables to see if there are any cash flow issues to fix before they become problems\n\nMaking it a habit to use your business cards to pay all expenses is the first step. Once you do, youâll see that balancing your statements is simplified. Since you pay everything via credit card, you only need to write a check to the card lender instead of one for each individual expense.\n\nFrom tracking your working capital to monitoring employee spending, the chain of finances becomes more efficient.\n\nYou also get peace of mind from having increased security this way.\n\nCredit card companies like Visa and MasterCard are considered legal entities that deal with treasury functions. If you register your credit card, itâs one of the âmember FDICâ-backed financial institutions. ACH payments are currencies that are also protected.\n\nGoing through your credit card instead of directly to your bank account gives you an enhanced security buffer. If any accounts are hacked, the damage is limited to the business card rather than your working capital account.\n\nYou may also like: 5 Ways to Take the Stress Out of Managing Hotel Bookings\n\n4. Simplifying Your Expense Charting\n\nOne of the first rules you learn when you start a business is to separate your personal and company expenses. This isnât always easy to do as a startup, but itâs an important goal.\n\nUsing business and virtual credit cards is a natural way to ensure this segregation happens. The card issuer may even categorize your business expenses for you to help you track your spending. These reports are helpful for expense charting.\n\nOther Useful Ways to Handle Expenses\n\nMany businesses delegate credit cards to certain employees.\n\nFor example, if you have an office manager, you can grant them access to a card for daily necessities.\n\nBecause youâve assigned a specific card to that person, you can track their spending anywhere in the U.S.A. In essence, youâre giving the employee carte blanche to make purchases without your approval.\n\nHowever, they also know youâll be monitoring their transactions periodically. They have the freedom to take care of in-the-moment expenses; you have less stress because you donât have to handle every transaction.\n\nDiscover: 5 Must-Have Apps for Managing Business Travel in 2022\n\n5. Layering Your Rewards with Engine\n\nWhen you get the hang of using business cards and virtual accounts to pay for expenses, youâll get hooked on the rewards youâre accruing.\n\nThe next step is to streamline how you use them to your advantage.\n\nSticking with one or two companies at first gives you the chance to learn in detail what they offer. In order to layer your rewards, you have to know the intercompany each system works with.\n\nEngine Layering in Action\n\nFor instance, Engine is the only third-party platform that allows you to use outside rewards alongside their program.\n\nLetâs take a step-by-step look at how our earlier example would work with layering:\n\nYou have a dozen employees heading out of town for a work conference. As the owner, you connect your business credit card to a set of virtual accounts for each person. This card also links to all your loyalty reward programs.\n\nEvery employee books their air travel through your preferred airline using their virtual card. You accrue reward points for each booking.\n\nThen, they log into Engine and book their rooms through your preferred hotel brand. Again, you gain reward points for each booking, but you get them through the hotel and Engine.\n\nThe next time you need lodging, youâll use your Engine reward points to get money off your reservation. Youâll also be able to use the hotelâs points to get discounts or upgrade your booking.\n\nYouâre not doing any extra steps. Youâre just thinking strategically about how to maximize your spending and minimize your workload.\n\nThatâs why business cards, combined with Engineâs platform, make the most sense. You accrue double points and can pay everyoneâs booking monthly instead of per reservation.\n\nSee also: 6 Tips for Getting Your Employees Onboarded with Engine\n\nConclusion\n\nAs with anything new, switching to virtual accounts and business credit cards takes time to flow seamlessly.\n\nWhen you understand how to use and integrate both into your processes, the benefits will more than outweigh the beginning struggles. And when you see the results, like your mega discounts at Engine, youâll be glad you made the switch!\n\nSign up for Engineâs free booking platform and start saving on business lodging today.\n\nâ",

      "# [Man Camp Housing vs. Hotels for Remote Construction Crews by Audrey Fairbrother on 2021-12-17](https://engine.com/business-travel-guide/remote-construction-preparation)\nThereâs a massive demand for construction services at the moment, and it only continues to grow.\n\nAccording to Autodesk, the construction industry needs to âbuild 13,000 buildings each day between now and 2050 to support an expected population of 7 billion people living in cities.â\n\nThe abundance of opportunity means that construction companies have more options than ever. Crews are no longer bound by location â they are now bidding on projects across the nation and beyond.\n\nAs a construction manager or lead contractor, this means that you may have to book housing for your traveling team.\n\nAt Engine, weâre business travel experts and arrange remote work trips for construction workers every day.\n\nHere are our tips to help you book lodging for your teamâs next remote construction job.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Consider All of Your Housing Options\n\n2. Hotels vs. Man Camps\n\n3. How to Book Lodging for Your Construction Crew\n\nConsider All of Your Housing Options\n\nWhether sourcing locally or bringing your own crew, youâll need key crew coordinators and project managers on-site â and theyâll need a place to stay.\n\nYour job is to ensure that managers and traveling crew members are comfortable and safe. This means it's your responsibility to find remote construction crew housing that fits your needs and budget.\n\nYou have two main options for housing your team:\n\nMan camp housing\n\nHotels\n\nLetâs talk about each of these options and how they compare.\n\nMan Camp Housing\n\nMan camps are temporary housing complexes where traveling tradespeople stay while theyâre working on short-term jobs, such as oil pipeline construction or resource development jobs.\n\nThese modular housing units contain all of the basic features of traditional living spaces â bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom, etc. â but can be disassembled or moved when the job is complete. Theyâre kind of like a cross between a mobile home and a shipping container.\n\nMan camps have been a housing solution for transient workers since the start of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nCamps vary greatly in design and the level of comfort they offer. Companies are even building man camps equipped with spas, barbershops and tanning booths in an effort to make these temporary housing solutions (and the sometimes dangerous jobs they accompany) more attractive to workers.\n\nWho Lives in Man Camps?\n\nThese modular constructions are often referred to as âoilfield housingâ or âfield campsâ because theyâre popular in the oil and natural gas industry. Itâs common for mining crews, pipeline workers and other teams working in the resource extraction industries to reside in these camps.\n\nThey are also popular for traveling construction crews. These modular buildings provide a place where your team can eat and sleep during off-work hours.\n\nBecause oil workers use them so much, man camps are most commonly seen in American and Canadian oil boom hotspots (think Texas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Alaska, British Columbia, etc.).\n\nHowever, construction companies use them in remote areas all over the U.S. and Canada.\n\nAre Man Camps the Right Housing Solution for Your Remote Construction Job?\n\nWork camp buildings have quite a few benefits. Their durability makes them good for laborers working on development projects. They also allow you to house your team on the job site, so they can step out the front door and get to work.\n\nTheyâre not necessary for every crew, though.\n\nFor one, they arenât the most cost-effective option for a small-to-midsize team.\n\nIf youâre staffing most of your team in the location of your project and only have to house 20 people, you probably donât need remote workforce housing in the form of man camps. Shipping and assembly cost money on top of the module rental itself.\n\nTheir small profile can also make for cramped living quarters.\n\nSlso, many workers arenât crazy about the strict rules that come with man camp life. For instance, many prohibit everything from alcohol consumption to family visits.\n\nAssuming thereâs a hotel in or near town, youâre better off booking there â your team will get a better nightâs rest.\n\nHotels\n\nHotels tend to be a good housing option for remote construction teams.\n\nTheyâre comfortable, clean, and they provide all of the amenities your team needs to feel at home on the road.\n\nEspecially in remote areas, hotels usually have large parking lots, so youâll have plenty of room for vehicles to shuttle your team back and forth from the job site â and often heavy vehicle parking.\n\nAlso, most hotels have quite a few rooms with double beds, which means as long as your employees are alright with sharing) you can save money by housing two employees in a room.\n\nHotels often have recreational facilities like pools and restaurants where everyone can relax and hang out after a hard dayâs work. Free breakfast and 24-hour coffee access can help boost your teamâs productivity without costing you money.\n\nWill a Hotel Have Enough Room for My Team?\n\nBig teams have big housing needs. You might need ten or twenty rooms to make sure everyone has a bed.\n\nMost hotels will be more than happy to reserve all the rooms you need, and they may even give you a bulk discount.\n\nHowever, you have to make sure that the rooms will be available during the dates of your project to ensure that they can provide all the rooms you need when the work needs to be done.\n\nHow do you figure out if the hotel you want to book has rooms available (and if you can get a deal)?\n\nYou have two options:\n\n1. Write a request for proposal (RFP) to the hotel\n\nAn RFP is a document you send to hotels that lets them know youâre interested in booking a large block of hotels with them.\n\nWe have a full hotel RFP guide here, but basically, itâs a way to let hotels know that youâre looking for a certain number of rooms during a specific time.\n\nIf they have the rooms available, theyâll send back a proposal with a price. From there, negotiations are open. You can accept the rate, ask for a lower price and wait for their response, or turn down their offer and look elsewhere.\n\nRelated: RFP Tools to Help You Book Lodging\n\n2. Partner with a hotel booking service\n\nBooking room blocks can be difficult. Hotels donât always have big blocks of rooms available at any given time. It could take you weeks to find a place within your budget that has what you need.\n\nOr, you can partner with a lodging service like Engine. Weâre good at getting corporate hotel discounts for companies like yours, and weâll negotiate on your behalf so you can focus on your project.\n\nHotels vs. Man Camps\n\nHotels and man camps are two of the best housing for your remote construction crew. Before you choose one, letâs look at the pros and cons of each.\n\nIn most cases, we think hotels are better than short-term housing options like man camps. When you book a hotel, you provide your crew with a space that is separate from the worksite.\n\nMan camps keep your crew on the project site itself, which has both its benefits and drawbacks. When living at a camp, your team can pretty much wake up, roll out of bed and get to work.\n\nWhile this may seem appealing from an efficiency standpoint, it can be detrimental in the long run for your teamâs morale and health.\n\nConversely, a hotel may be further away from the job site and necessitate you to set up transportation for your crew at the start and end of the workday.\n\nYet, housing your work crew in a hotel can help create a clear division between the workday and your employeeâs free time, which can reduce stress and depression. Hotels also offer access to amenities for workers to enjoy in their downtime â which are likely absent on the job site.\n\nMasonry Magazine discusses this very topic and the importance of creating a balanced work-life schedule for your crew.\n\nRelated: A Construction Managerâs Guide to Crew Housing\n\nHow to Book Lodging for Your Construction Crew\n\nPartnering with a lodging management service makes it easy to book remote crew lodging that meets your needs and budget. All without hours wasted scrolling Google and tourist-focused hotel websites.\n\nWhether you go the man-camp route or decide to house your team in traditional hotel rooms, managing business travel will always be a hassle if you go it alone.\n\nThink of how much work it entails:\n\nResearching locations and amenities\n\nNegotiating room rates and planning reservations\n\nTracking expenses and managing budgets\n\nJuggling multiple and rotating crew members\n\nSolving lodging issues as teams arrive\n\nâ¦ all of this on top of your other hiring and management duties.\n\nThatâs why corporate lodging services exist. Weâll track down the best deals, negotiate on your behalf, and help you manage your bookings.\n\nThat way, youâll have more time to focus on the other parts of your job!\n\nHow to Find the Right Lodging Management Company\n\nThere are many companies that address corporate travel needs, but there are a few things you should look for in a provider:\n\nBroad Inventory\n\nFinding the perfect accommodations can take days. After all, you need a place that meets your exact criteria:\n\nClose to your job site\n\nHas the number of rooms you need\n\nAvailable during the time of your project\n\nOffers the right services and amenities (WiFi, on-site parking, etc.)\n\nPriced within your budget\n\nAll of those needs can make it hard to find the right place for your team, but the right partner will have a catalog of hotels in every corner of the world, from the most cosmopolitan city to the most rural areas.\n\nThis means youâll always have plenty of housing options to choose from near your site.\n\nManagement Software\n\nWorking with a travel management service is a collaborative process; we provide expert advice, and you make all the important decisions.\n\nBecause itâs a collaborative process, the best services give you access to a shared software program where you can view and track all of your travel info.\n\nSearch according to your specific criteria, browse deals that arenât available to the public, and manage your upcoming bookings â all in one place!\n\nCorporate Focus\n\nBusiness lodging and personal lodging are very different. Business-centric lodging managers understand that difference and will leverage it to secure pre-negotiated corporate rates and unique services for your team.\n\nWorking with someone who understands the needs of your business can make a big difference in both the cost and quality of accommodations.\n\nWe negotiate rates for crew lodging and project-based stays around the country. Learn how our Group Bookings service can help you save big on hotel rates.\n\nYou can also pay for your lodging using our automated monthly direct billing invoicing system.

      "# [Hotels for Healthcare Travelers - Traveling Nurses, Locum Tenens, Allied Professionals by Audrey Fairbrother on 2022-07-26](https://engine.com/business-travel-guide/locum-tenens-allied)\nAs a traveling nurse, locum tenens or allied professional, your time on the job is spent on the road. During your long assignments, you want the place you stay to feel as much like home as possible.\n\nMany top hotel chains have upped their game in quality and features over the years, thanks to a strategy of listening to customer needs and reacting accordingly.\n\nEach of the seven chains listed below offers a variety of temporary housing options to ensure that no matter how long or intensive your stay is, they have you covered. Read below before booking your or your coworkersâ next travel nurse housing experience.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1. Drury\n\n2. Graduate\n\n3. Choice\n\n4. G6\n\n5. Hilton\n\n6. Wyndham\n\n7. Best Western\n\nDrury\n\nA Drury Hotel can feel like a diamond in the rough when it comes to booking a stay.\n\nBrands include:\n\nDrury Inn & Suites: Your best bet for long-term locum tenens stays\n\nDrury Plaza Hotels: Short-term rental comfort\n\nPear Tree Inn by Drury: Lower-cost group rates while retaining Drury quality\n\nA gift to healthcare travelers, Drury Inn & Suites offers the amenities you need to spend your stay in comfort.\n\nFor instance, many will offer free breakfasts.\n\nThatâs ideal for traveling nurses who are coming back from a stressful overnight shift and looking for more than a pre-packaged yogurt and bowl of cereal.\n\nDrury Inn & Suites offers free hot breakfast daily. Enjoy some scrambled eggs, fresh fruit and hot coffee before a long day at the practice or hospital.\n\nFree 5:30 Kickback\n\nWhile complimentary hot breakfasts arenât unique to Drury, the Free 5:30 Kickback is. This Happy Hour evening snacks and drinks concept, available at participating locations, is designed for you to relax a bit after a long workday â at no extra charge to you or your company credit cards.\n\nExact menus vary by location, but this sample menu gives you a sense of the snacks, dinner fare and drinks that are available each evening between 5:30 and 7pm.\n\nWhen youâre away from home, itâs nice to have access to hot food without the inconvenience of heading back into town or ordering takeout.\n\nRelated: Are You a Traveling Nurse Looking for Extended Stay Hotel Deals?\n\nGraduate\n\nGraduate is perhaps the most unique hotel chain on this list. They arenât geared toward the average traveler; instead, they are all situated in college towns near universities.\n\nGraduate Hotelsâ primary clientele includes:\n\nParents visiting for the weekends or helping students move into their new dorms\n\nAlumni coming back for donor functions\n\nSchool sports fans in town for the big game\n\nPro league recruiters\n\nOf course, Graduate Hotels are open to all guests. Because university towns typically have medical centers, they can be a great place for traveling medical professionals to stay.\n\nIf youâre a travel coordinator, you can benefit from putting your allied professional staff in the heart of town.\n\nGraduate Hotels are known for their quirky decor and top-notch service. Whether youâre visiting for a work assignment or a conference, this chain always delivers a memorable stay.\n\nGraduate Homes\n\nAn interesting way to enjoy all the amenities of Graduate a little more long-term comfort than a hotel room can provide is by utilizing Graduate Homes.\n\nThese are furnished apartments, condos and houses that people in college towns list to renters on the Graduate platform.\n\nItâs like staying in a furnished vacation rental, but with the housekeeping, service and booking convenience of a hotel.\n\nYou can book your own housing with Graduate Homes through the Engine platform. Healthcare professionals can stay in a place that feels as close to home as they can get.\n\nChoice\n\nYou may not recall seeing a highway sign for Choice Hotels before, but this parent company has many recognizable brands within its umbrella.\n\nThe most famous ones on the list include:\n\nComfort Inn\n\nQuality Inn\n\nEconoLodge\n\nMainStay Suites\n\nBecause Choice Hotels offers such a wide range of brands with options anywhere, sticking with them ensures that youâll always be able to earn Choice Privileges rewards and stack up some free stays.\n\nWith Engine, you can double up on rewards. With each stay, you can earn brand-specific rewards while also receiving HE Rewards points.\n\nG6\n\nNo, weâre not talking about spending a night in a private jet (although weâre sure you wouldnât mind). Like Choice, G6 is an umbrella brand encompassing Motel 6 and Studio 6 (sometimes known as Studio 6 Suites) properties.\n\nMotel 6 has invested in extensive interior remodeling recently, so travelers can expect rooms that are updated, clean and comfortable.\n\nMotel 6 will always be known as an economical choice that offers comfort and reliability.\n\nStudio 6\n\nEven with the benefit of multi-night discounts, booking extended stay rooms can get a little pricey.\n\nBut there are few great alternatives. Most apartments want at least a 6-month lease, which isnât practical for a locum tenens taking over a 4-month maternity position.\n\nHowever, you canât expect staff to stay in a basic hotel room for months and go out to eat all the time. That gets old for the traveler and costs the company a lot of money over time.\n\nThe solution is typically an extended stay studio with some basic kitchen appliances like:\n\nMicrowave\n\nSmall stove\n\nHome-size refrigerator\n\nStudio 6 caters to the needs of healthcare professionals on long travel nursing assignments.\n\nThey aim to deliver on both affordability and high-quality accommodations.\n\nOr, as they put it:\n\nâStudio 6 is strategically positioned between the upper end of the economy extended stay and lower end of the mid-price extended stay segments.â\n\nHilton\n\nYou probably know Hilton as a hotel chain with a higher-end vacation rental feel but with affordable rates.\n\nYou may not know how many different brands exist under the Hilton parent company. In addition to Hilton-branded properties, they include:\n\nHampton\n\nHomewood Suites\n\nEmbassy Suites\n\nDoubleTree\n\nCanopy\n\nConrad\n\nWaldorf Astoria\n\nWithin this family of brands â which includes suites that are geared toward longer stays â youâre likely to find something that works well for your travel needs.\n\nPet-Friendly\n\nBeing away from home can be difficult, especially as a healthcare traveler.\n\nAfter a tough day at a hospital in an unfamiliar city, wouldnât it be nice to come back to your home-away-from-home and have your best bud waiting for you?\n\nHilton can make that happen with their pet-friendly rooms.\n\nThere is often a small fee, so check with the specific property manager for details. Still, for many healthcare professionals, having their pets with them at their hotel is priceless.\n\nWyndham\n\nLike many other companies on this list, Wyndham also owns a variety of familiar brands, the most recognizable ones including:\n\nWyndham Garden\n\nRamada\n\nSuper 8\n\nDays Inn\n\nHoward Johnson\n\nTravelodge\n\nBetween all of these brands (each of which has an impressive geographic footprint on its own), you can find a Wyndham property just about anywhere. According to Wyndham, youâre rarely more than 10 minutes away from one of their hotels.\n\nGroup Reservations\n\nIf youâre coordinating stays for dozens of traveling nurses from your agency for long periods, Wyndhamâs group rates will really come in handy.\n\nSpecial savings are offered for group hotels when booking at least five rooms for a minimum of seven nights, or at least ten rooms for any number of nights.\n\nLooking for more than 8 rooms, or a long-term stay? Engineâs Groups team can coordinate your entire booking for you. Sign up here now.\n\nBest Western\n\nBest Western is already the most ubiquitous hotel name in America, but they also offer quite a variety of properties, each with slightly different types of accommodation. Their brands include:\n\nBest Western Plus\n\nBest Western Premier\n\nBest Western Signature\n\nSadie\n\nAiden\n\nExecutive Residency\n\nBest Westernâs reliable reputation means that travel coordinators and traveling healthcare professionals can count on booking a quality stay every time without any hassle.\n\nBest Westernâs Premier, Plus and Signature properties offer additional amenities (at a slightly higher price).\n\nSadie and Aiden\n\nA new concept for Best Western, Sadie is an attempt to break the mold while retaining the quality you know and love.\n\nIn addition to the clean linens and free WiFi, these properties offer a unique twist. They look the part of their surrounding areas, embodying local architecture.\n\nNurses work long hours and donât always get a chance to take in the sites. With Sadie, you can get a taste of the local vibe even on days when you donât have the energy to go out exploring after work.\n\nAiden is like Sadie in its pursuit of the eccentric, but with a few unique features that come standard:\n\nRooftop gym and lounge\n\nSelf-serve beer on tap in the lobby\n\nOutdoor cornhole\n\nAfter a long day of caring for patients, what better way is there to unwind than with an ice-cold beer in your room?\n\nEven home living doesnât offer draft beer on demand (unless youâve got a kegerator, of course)!\n\nExecutive Residency\n\nIf youâre looking for an extended stay hotel with the consistency of Best Western, look no further than Executive Residency.\n\nThese suites are set up with the spaces youâll need throughout your day, making them perfect as temporary professional housing.\n\nNo one wants to eat takeout on their beds for every meal.\n\nExecutive Residency suites have a kitchenette with a dining table so you can keep your meal time separate from sleep time. Additionally, youâll have a cooktop and sink so you can prepare some decent meals on your own.\n\nAll the while, you can keep doubling up on Best Western and Engine rewards, earning valuable free nights in the future.\n\nSee also: How to Find and Book the Best Executive Rentals\n\nConclusion\n\nBeing away from home no longer means you need to leave conveniences and comforts behind.\n\nTraveling nurses, locum tenens, allied professionals and other valuable healthcare industry members deserve nothing less than the best. But budgets and housing stipends arenât unlimited.\n\nWith Engineâs Lodging Performance Network, you can book travel nurse housing with one of our incredible partners listed above with just the click of a button. Itâs free to sign up, there are no booking fees, and youâll get access to great rates with exclusive discounts up to 60% off of consumer sites.\n\nMedical agencies that coordinate travel should always be getting the best hotel rates available.

Itâs more important than ever for business travelers and travel coordinators to be strategic about the types of trips booked and how resources are chosen and used.\n\nLeveraging travel apps and software is one of the best ways to get a handle on every aspect of a trip, from takeoff to touchdown and everything between.\n\nSimplify your business travel plans with a few of these 17 apps.\n\nAll are available for both iPhone and Android.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1.

Create claims for everything and anything while providing a full audit trail just by taking pictures.\n\nYour employer will need an Expensify business plan, but it won't break the bank at only $5 a month.

It also keeps the last ten years of historical rate data for comparison purposes.\n\nWith Rate Alerts, you donât need to keep checking the rate while trying to work either.

With Flightviewâs flight map, you can see where your plane is in real time.\n\nIf you get into a pickle with a missed connection, you can even use Flightview to check which alternative cheap flights might be available to you.\n\nDownload it for free on the App Store or Google Play.\n\nIf your flight is on time, youâd better be on time, too. Keep our airport security tips in mind to help you breeze through the terminal.\n\nThe Weather Channel\n\nYouâre trying to figure out which clothes to pack for your business trip â better check the weather, right?\n\nWhile your phoneâs default weather app might be a go-to, you can find more detailed information on The Weather Channel.\n\nThis app features:\n\nHourly forecasts\n\nDaily forecasts\n\nWeather bulletins\n\nStorm update videos from the channel (remember cable TV?)\n\nYou can download The Weather Channel free on the App Store or Google Play and ensure that youâre prepared for whatever the local weather has in store.\n\nIf you really appreciate having the best meteorological data available, upgrading to The Weather Channel Pro version will give you ad-free eight-day hourly forecasts and three-day future radar for $4.99 per month or $29.99 per year.\n\nWhatsApp\n\nFor any messaging, calling or video chatting needs, this app keeps you connected as long as you have an internet connection. Whether youâre coordinating with colleagues or just letting your loved ones know that you arrived safely, itâs important to be able to get in touch.\n\nWhatsApp has become one of the worldâs most popular communication apps thanks to its ease of use and reliability. In some countries outside of the US, messaging on WhatsApp is even more common than texting.\n\nIf youâre traveling abroad and wonât have a data plan (or if you donât have reliable cell service at your hotel), WhatsApp is essential for allowing you to make calls, have video chats and send messages via WiFi.\n\nDownload WhatsApp on the App Store or Google Play and use it for free on WiFi (carrier data and roaming charges may apply if you use it on your data network).\n\nWhatsApp Business\n\nWhatsApp Business is another version of WhatsApp youâll have to install separately.\n\nThis app is useful for anyone with a company phone number. With WhatsApp Businesses, you can send and receive messages and calls from another number without having to carry a second phone.\n\nWhatsApp Business will let you keep all your business correspondence under a separate app. It lets you stay in touch with work contacts without sharing your personal phone number.\n\nDownload WhatsApp Business on the App Store or Google Play. Again, the app is free but carrier data and roaming charges may apply.\n\nGoogle Translate\n\nA must-have for overseas travelers, Google Translate supports over 80 languages and will work on anything from individual words to entire documents.\n\nType or paste what you want to say, and youâll see the translation. Or, type in what you see or hear and receive the English translation.\n\nInvolved in a real-world conversation where typing is too slow? Use voice command or have your phone speak for you.\n\nOut to a company lunch and the restaurant doesnât have any English menus? Open the camera and point it at the menu. After a few seconds, youâll see the entire menu in English on your screen!\n\nDownload Google Translate for free on the App Store or Google Play.\n\nHelloSign\n\nLocating a scanner can be hard enough in your hometown. When youâre traveling in an unfamiliar place, this is even more of a daunting task.\n\nYet, you may well find yourself in a situation where you need to manage contracts or digitize documents on the fly.\n\nHelloSign is the easiest way to scan, edit, sign and send documents, such as a hotel RFP, from your phone:\n\nTake a picture of the document\n\nImport it to an editable PDF\n\nSign documents\n\nTransfer them to your email\n\nItâs like an entire business center right in the palm of your hand. You can even send documents back to the home office for signatures â all from your phone.\n\nDownload HelloSign for free on the App Store or Google Play.\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nGoogle Maps is one of the most useful apps out there, period.\n\nIf you have a smartphone, access to a network and Google Maps, you might never get lost again. Even if you know ahead of time that you wonât have internet access, you can download offline maps over WiFi before you leave the hotel.\n\nBy helping you plan routes and find the best modes of transport to get around, Google Maps is a very useful tool for business travel. You can see when there are traffic delays too, ensuring that you wonât be late for an important meeting.\n\nEven after work hours, you can use Google Maps to discover places to visit, eat, drink or catch a show, too. Itâs nice to be able to spend your downtime enjoying a new place instead of just wondering where to go!\n\nWhether youâre renting a car, taking public transportation or even walking, Google Maps can help you get where you need to go.\n\nDownload it for free on the App Store or Google Play.\n\nSpotHero\n\nWhen youâre in an unfamiliar place â especially if itâs a big city like New York â finding a parking spot can be seriously stressful.\n\nIn the past, youâd have to just circle around and look for an opening (then, cross your fingers and hope that you didnât miss a No Parking or street sweeping sign). Often, youâd end up with a parking ticket despite your best efforts.\n\nYou can usually find a paid lot to park in, but the rates can vary drastically.\n\nWith SpotHero, those nightmare days are over. Now you can book your parking space in a convenient location before you even leave for your trip.\n\nThis app includes the following features:\n\nCompare rates of various parking lots and facilities nearby.\n\nBook and pay for your parking pass in advance.\n\nFind parking thatâs available in real time for spur-of-the-moment needs.\n\nYou can even use SpotHero to lock in your parking space at your departure airport before you leave, saving you valuable time before your flight.\n\nDownload it for free on the App Store or Google Play. Just pay per parking spot as needed.\n\nUber or Lyft\n\nNow that Uber and Lyft have garnered a more international presence, you can easily use either in many countries worldwide.\n\nGetting around by car is faster, simpler and cheaper than before, and itâs all controlled with an app. Whether youâre looking for airport transfers, a ride to work or a general way to get around, there is no doubt car transportation apps have changed everything.\n\nThe apps are easy to use. Register, set up your credit card payment, including travel credit cards, enable GPS on your phone and the rest is simple. Youâll only pay when you get a ride.\n\nUber: App Store or Google Play\n\nLyft: App Store or Google Play\n\nWaze\n\nDifferent GPS navigation apps excel at different things. While Google Maps is the best at finding quality destinations, researching everything about them (like hours, menu or pricing) and getting you there accurately, Waze is the best at giving you the most comfortable drive possible.\n\nWaze lets users interact with each other to get up-to-date alerts on:\n\nTraffic\n\nConstruction\n\nAccidents\n\nSpeed traps\n\nGas station pricing\n\nYou can also control your favorite music or podcasts directly through Waze without having to switch apps while driving, which is especially useful if you have a long road trip ahead of you.\n\nDownload it for free on the App Store or Google Play.\n\nYelp\n\nWhether you are looking for the best burger in town for a quick bite or a fine dining establishment where you can impress your client, Yelp has you covered.\n\nFounded in 2004, Yelp was a powerhouse website before smartphones even became a thing, so you know its wealth of data and reviews has what you need to make the best choice.\n\nSearch by city or ZIP code for reviews from real people â including many fellow business travelers with relevant travel tips to share.\n\nDownload the Yelp app for free on the App Store or Google Play.\n\nOpenTable\n\nOnce youâve found that perfect restaurant, youâll likely need a reservation, especially if itâs peak lunch hour or a busy Friday night.\n\nIf youâre taking clients out for a meal, you definitely donât want to waste their time by showing up at a restaurant without a table ready for you.\n\nOpenTable is a free, easy way to make reservations at thousands of restaurants. In fact, when you go to make a reservation on a restaurantâs website, youâll often be redirected to OpenTable to confirm your selection.\n\nBest of all, you can earn points for dining out that you can later use to save money off your next meal, especially on a meal allowance.\n\nDownload it on the App Store or Google Play.\n\nAre you booking a reservation for your employees? You should also consider this advice for planning their meal allowances.\n\nSleep Cycle\n\nOne of the toughest things about business travel is staying alert, present and focused in your meetings despite dealing with the rigors of travel and adjusting to a different time zone.\n\nSleep Cycle helps by ensuring that you get a good nightâs sleep, no matter where you are.\n\nThe app analyzes your sleep patterns based on your movements and waits until youâre in your lightest sleep stage to wake you up. That way, opening your eyes is gradual and peaceful rather than a shock to the system.\n\nWhen jet lag has you off schedule, Sleep Cycle can be crucial to ensure youâre well-rested and rejuvenated for that morning meeting â and that you donât sleep through it.\n\nDownload Sleep Cycle for free on the App Store or Google Play and start enjoying the main functions.\n\nOr, for $49.99 per year, you can experience Premium. Advanced features include a customizable wake-up window, trends and data export for compatibility with other apps. On iOS for iPhone, for example, Sleep Cycle can be used in conjunction with the Health app to track your sleep hours.\n\nIzziRent\n\nWhen rental car prices are out of control, an app like IzziRent can be very useful.\n\nThis app compares prices at more than 850 car rental suppliers around the world. Itâll help you feel confident that you got the best price available.\n\nThe app also features discounts not available to the general public. When youâve found the best deal for your needs, booking and payment are a snap.\n\nDownload it for free on the App Store or Google Play. Only pay when you make a reservation.\n\nEngine\n\nCorporate hotel booking tools and end-to-end expense reporting are extremely valuable when youâre traveling for business â and Engineâs app keeps them at your fingertips.\n\nSay goodbye to having your business lodging data scattered across several different email accounts or spreadsheets, creating a paperwork nightmare before check-in even happens.\n\nWith Engine, you can book rooms from more than 700,000 of the best hotels at the best rates and consolidate lodging data into easy-to-use reports.\n\nTravel managers will love features like:\n\nSort, filter and personalize hotel rooms based on several criteria, including price and savings.\n\nPersonalize your dashboard to track hotel stays, savings and billing.\n\nIf you qualify for the Direct Bill program, get one streamlined bill for all incurred hotel charges at the end of the month.\n\nSet up Travel Policies to set spending limits on individual travelersâ accounts and allow them to book their own rooms while staying on budget.\n\nRetain oversight over your organizationâs travel activity group booking support.\n\nYou can even book rooms directly from the mobile app in case of a last-minute change of plans, and reach a 24/7 dedicated Member Support team to assist with any snafus.\n\nDownload the app for free on the App Store or Google Play.

For example, I’ve found Staybridge hotel from IHG website for $95 and $90 for government rate. HE charges the same hotel at $99. They’re in the business of reselling at higher markup. Small pocket change but multiplied by thousands of transaction per day equal substantial profit margin. \nHotel Engine is a mediocre platform for hotel reservation. State of TX has a multi-year contract with Hotel Engine (HE) which makes no sense since it is a new player without a proven record. It’s better for State of TX employees to book direct with hotel because at least it gives them more choices. HE search result is very dishonest and misleading. On the mobile app, there is no way to filter out room that is not available on the search result so you end up wasting time clicking through each hotel to find it has room available. Prices are often higher than direct booking. I would not recommend this app to anyone unless you don’t have any other option.",

They have pretty good deals and are competitive with the other companies out there in terms of pricing but was not my first choice cause I like to get points for my stays.  I try to book only Hilton family hotels so I can accumulate points and earn some free nights for vacations with the fam.  \n\nTo my surprise, Hotel Engine now allows you to use your loyalty number while booking!!! \n\nFor real this is a total game changer for me! Also they upgraded their mobile app and is now a million times better than the old one!!

It gets you a discount as promised, but not any better than some other apps. I often check my other apps too and sometimes use this one, and sometimes use the others depending on the discount. It would be nice to just know the discount is going to be the best available. The ability to get clean receipts without advertising or unless comments is lacking also. A must for accounting purposes.

For example, I’ve found Staybridge hotel from IHG website for $95 and $90 for government rate. HE charges the same hotel at $99. They’re in the business of reselling at higher markup. Small pocket change but multiplied by thousands of transaction per day equal substantial profit margin. \nHotel Engine is a mediocre platform for hotel reservation. State of TX has a multi-year contract with Hotel Engine (HE) which makes no sense since it is a new player without a proven record. It’s better for State of TX employees to book direct with hotel because at least it gives them more choices. HE search result is very dishonest and misleading. On the mobile app, there is no way to filter out room that is not available on the search result so you end up wasting time clicking through each hotel to find it has room available.

Guests are prepaying them and then this company is booking standard Marriott rates (I can’t imagine how much the guest is paying if this company is actually making a profit)\n\nThey are asking us to run the card they have on file which they say is a virtual card. Normally we need a cc auth or to swipe a card in person except in the cases of entities like Expedia/Booking etc. that have their own rate programs and contracted agreements set up. \n\nThe first time one came through we ran the guests card because we didn’t even notice it was anything different from a standard res. The second time they ended up sending us a credit card authorization, but they didn’t even send it until after the guest checked out. \n\nThey don’t seem to have an extranet or anything set up. This seems so sketchy and like it would be so easily to commit fraud through. \n\nThey are also telling us that we are not to give the folio to the guest, but like I said they are standard rates so I doubt there is a contract in place.\n\n## Comment ID i6895up with +3 score by [(Oop_awwPants, Reddit, 2022-04-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/uc1w4e/hotelengine/i6895up/) (in reply to ID uc1w4e):\nHotel Engine is a corporate booking tool, they're just a bit newer.

Just because you have your hotel membership aligned with hotel engines doesn’t mean you’ll get the points, they skim the points off you if it doesn’t meet their criteria. **per hotel engines customer service: each hotel that meets your criteria in the search will show you if you get points or not. EVEN IF YOU HAVE A MEMBERSHIP WITH THAT CHAIN!**\n\nI got the receipt for the stay from the hotel, it was booked with hotel engines. Hotel engines used Expedia to make the booking. Thereby they’re literally a 4th party service! So the hotel manager says, “yes you stayed, contact the hotel chain customer service for an explanation.”\n\nThe hotel chain customer service says “bc you booked with a 3rd party vendor, you will not be getting points.” \n\nThis despite, like you’re suggesting, linking your hotel accounts with hotel engines. So I’m left to assume hotel engines, as a 4th party, is in kahoots with the 3rd party vendor and stealing peoples points.\n\nAgain I see the strength for flexibility for managers who book. But for the people that actually stay, they get shafted, no points for the stay.\n\nI also want to mention that I got points last time I stayed with the same hotel at the same location but didn’t use hotel engines. So it’s a 3rd, well, 4th party scam. Use it to find rates, then quote the rate to the hotel directly. Under no circumstances would I suggest anyone use it to book rooms unless of course points don’t matter.\n\nI stay close to 140 nights in hotels every year.

They also might view this as a deal breaker, for example if they're looking for people to be regularly checking in very late or working night shifts locally, and thus needing to have a check out time in the late evening or night.\n\n### Comment ID jr2jiyt with +2 score by [(AdTemporary6698, Reddit, 2023-07-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/14th9oq/corporate_lodging_rates/jr2jiyt/) (in reply to ID jr2hqhk):\nYeah, they told me it was non-negotiable, and if I didn't agree to the 24 hours, the contract would be canceled. \n\nGetting two nights for the price of one is non-negotiable on my end as well, and I understand they may not ask for that often, but we've done 5k ytd before raising our rates $25 a night.

If your property isn't in significant need of the contract, you don't need to purse it to a greater extent.  If you were, there's always the option of coming back to the negotiating table and asking them to reach out to their individual companies to see whether or not that's a deal breaker for *them* as well.\n\n#### Comment ID jr2nkkm with +2 score by [(Letstalktrashtv, Reddit, 2023-07-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/14th9oq/corporate_lodging_rates/jr2nkkm/) (in reply to ID jr2jiyt):\nCan you write an amendment to the contact that ONLY allows the 24 hour period to be from noon to noon?\n\n## Comment ID jr33jkm with +3 score by [(blueprint_01, Reddit, 2023-07-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/14th9oq/corporate_lodging_rates/jr33jkm/) (in reply to ID 14th9oq):\nCLC is dead.

Currently, we're using Melon (partner of Corporate Traveler), but it's leaving us a bit sour. The search function is as slow as a snail, the interface feels clunky, and don't even get me started on the reporting!\n\nHas anyone here tried Navan for booking travel? I'm intrigued by its sleek interface, the ease of setting up approvals, and its ability to handle group travel. We are a small office of 40 people, but we travel accross Europe, Asia, and Latam, racking up a hefty annual travel spend of nearly 2 million.\n\nI'm all ears for your thoughts, the good, the bad, and the unexpected if we decide to make the switch! Thanks, you amazing bunch!\n\n## Comment ID kxwvq9g with +12 score by [(nancy_drew_98, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1bv1gji/navan_travel_software_thoughts_and_opinions/kxwvq9g/) (in reply to ID 1bv1gji):\nOh, OP, I'm so glad you asked - do NOT use Navan.    \n  \nHere is a basic breakdown of how they work: Navan books your travel using third-party aggregators like booking.com or hotels.com.  So when something goes wrong - and it will - Navan will then tell you to reach out to the aggregator.  The aggregator, however, is going to tell you that you need to either contact Navan or the hotel/airline/car rental service directly.  You'll spend hours if not days begging for someone, anyone, to help you resolve the issue.  This happened to us more than once.\n\nEven with minor issues, Navan's customer service is abysmal.  As part of our contract, we were supposed to have a dedicated customer service manager who could assist with any issue.  Every time I emailed him, his response was (literally, no joke) \"okay, but did you try the chat function for help?\"  He was of absolutely no assistance, and the chat service agents are tier 1 support with no authority or empowerment to actually provide any assistance.  It was beyond frustrating.  \n\nTheir parameters for what qualifies as \"group travel\" are almost useless - if you're a smaller organisation it might not be too bad, but I think when my company was using them their \"group travel\" was for over ten people but fewer than 25 which was of no assistance to me because I plan internal events with 50-100 people.\n\nIn a nutshell: keep looking.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but hopefully my extremely poor experiences with them will serve a purpose here.\n\n### Comment ID kxxmp9t with +5 score by [(Princessladybug17, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1bv1gji/navan_travel_software_thoughts_and_opinions/kxxmp9t/) (in reply to ID kxwvq9g):\nCame here to share this exactly!

When you change a flight/hotel if there is a change fee you can’t get an invoice for that exact amount, only a new invoice with the total price and no notes on the change fee. This is obviously a problem if you’re expensing flights/hotels and fees for a business.

I've found that trying to book flights on different airlines is difficult. AND that you \\*have\\* to choose a departure flight before you can choose a return flight. I often do a google flights search for the flights that work best for my exec and then HOPE I can choose those flights on Navan. Hotel room prices are all over the place due to the aggregators, so you have to be sure you're getting the best refundable price (per our policy), which is usually a bit more than just going direct to the hotel. \n\nThis week alone I've had to cancel and then rebook black cars, because neither the car company nor Navan could just change the pick up and drop off locations. Same dates, etc. but new pick up time/location. Dumb. \n\nMy biggest pet peeve, though, is that there is nowhere to add a \"note\" to the reservations. I've asked our administrator to look into adding a \"notes\" box or something, but Navan said it's not possible. I'd love to be able to add a note to my exec about his trip. Like if I have to book his seat via the airline website, because Navan won't let me choose one, there should be a place I can put note to let him know where he's sitting. It's frustrating. Concur had a notes section. It was very helpful.\n\nNavan is also our expense report app, so all of us have Navan cards/virtual cards for booking, purchasing meals, etc. It's super clunky to add receipts. It's just not a great app.\n\n## Comment ID l49ps1q with +2 score by [(chiefchiefb, Reddit, 2024-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1bv1gji/navan_travel_software_thoughts_and_opinions/l49ps1q/) (in reply to ID 1bv1gji):\nYeah, do not utilize it - it’s cumbersome, flight credits disappear (you really have to keep track when you cancel a flight and receive a credit), the UI is misleading from desktop to app (the app allows you to use flight credits, but it won’t apply it and will charge your card)\n\nAnd worst of all, the customer service is terrible…they are not in the know, often can’t help and are not accountable. They’ve told me things that were 100% wrong and cost us time, when I let them know they were wrong, they blamed others/shifted the blame. \n\nOverall, it’s a headache if you ever need to make changes. It’s far from seamless and I suspect their system is costing companies a lot of money due to their management of bookings.\n\n## Comment ID l64ovkz with +2 score by [(hadenoughoftoxicppl, Reddit, 2024-05-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1bv1gji/navan_travel_software_thoughts_and_opinions/l64ovkz/) (in reply to ID 1bv1gji):\nIt is a terrible app. Not suitable for large enterprise organisations where professionals travel frequently with complex routing.

For full transparency I am a customer service manager with Navan (started as a consultant in 2018 when we were TripActions).\n\nFlights\nNavan searches flights from multiple sources, including multiple GDS’s, NDC, and TravelFusion (a low cost carrier portal). This allows us to present THE most robust content of any TMC globally. \n\nHotels\nYes, we source from aggregators, but we also source direct from the property (GDS) to offer the most robust rate selection based on a traveler’s preferences and priorities and the booking source is clearly shown along with each rate (direct rate, booking.com, hotels.com, etc.) Navan is probably the most transparent when it comes to hotel content. Additionally for third-party bookings, users are NEVER referred to the aggregator EXCEPT for Agoda bookings and this is due to their ridiculous, unnecessary policy of only speaking with the guest even if the booking originated with an agency . Agoda is a Priceline brand  and we have actively been working with them to try to find a solution. Also, per our third-party agreements, we are required to abide by the rate rules. This means we cannot ask for refunds for non-refundable bookings. Note that this applies to third-party (aggregator) bookings. But the majority of our properties and rates are hotel-direct rates which are booked via a GDS (legacy travel agent system.)\n\nCars\nCars are booked via GDS. Not much to say.\n\nRail\nWe currently offer full content with Amtrak, UK Rail suppliers, SNCF, RENFE, SNCB, NS, DB, OBB, SBB, and TrenItalia.\n\n### Comment ID ldkaomv with +1 score by [(Successful-Jacket856, Reddit, 2024-07-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1bv1gji/navan_travel_software_thoughts_and_opinions/ldkaomv/) (in reply to ID l8pq2ex):\nHey I know you wrote this comment a little while ago but I've been looking at Navan myself and came across this thread.

He saw there was an extra $600 charge in his bank account, for a 1-way ticket to TX. He went to the Navan app but it  wasn't very intuitive on terms of helping him gather any details of what could've happened. The extra charge on his bank account showed as SW Airline, not Navan (unlike the other correct charges; labeled as Navan.) The airline told him Navan purchased two 1-way tickets to TX. 2.5 weeks ago he requested a refund from Navan. They said he'd have to reach out to the airline, and it would take 5-10 biz says for the airline to send the refund to Navan. He waited 1 week & assumed *his* refund process would be automatic, waiting for them to issue it. He reached back out, they had his money, yaaaay. But I guess he had to verbally tell them \"ok you can gimme my $ now please\". So then they said bet, give us 3-5 biz days and it'll be in your bank account. \n\n\nMy poor guy. He's a marine, and he's also a Sales Dev Rep. He's always going above & beyond to make the schedule timing & financial planning of each job work with the other.

      "# Post ID 125xllt: New to booking hotels for my staff and constantly getting fees/entire bookings charged to the guest's card. Am I doing hotels wrong?! with +10 score by [(peanutismint, Reddit, 2023-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/)\nI've been a travelling freelance contractor for many years staying in hotels all over the world so I thought I knew how the process worked - usually my clients would include me in their room block and upon check-in I'd be asked to provide my personal credit card for incidentals but the cost of the booking would already be taken care of. Sure there were one or two times where a mixup meant I was forced to put down my own credit card to pay for the rooms, but that was the exception (in my experience).\n\nRecently, though, I started a new role booking hotel rooms for my company's freelance staff, and it's been a major pain point. It seems that even when our travel agent books a room on behalf of our staff member and supplies our corporate account details for payment, OR when I 'manually' book a last minute hotel room myself using my company card but adding the guest's name to the room booking, my freelance staff are still ending up being charged on their personal cards for their room booking fees/resort fees/taxes etc.\n\nThis is particularly irking to me as an ex-freelancer as I don't ever expect my staff to pay for their own rooms, even if they will be reimbursed. It's simply not fair to expect someone to pay from their own personal funds in order to work, and not everybody is priveleged enough to have money in their bank account or a credit card to cover these $500-per-night hotels that some of our clients hold events at.\n\nAm I doing hotel booking wrong? This even seems to happen when I fill out those 'pre-authorisation' forms to try to ensure our company card is billed but then on check-in they STILL ask my staff to provide a card for a deposit or what have you, and wouldn't you know it 9 times out of 10 that's the card they end up charging, making a huge headache for us and our accounts team when it comes time to reimburse our staff.\n\nThankfully as yet nobody has been unable to check in due to lack of personal funds, but I shudder to think of any of my staff maxing out their credit cards/not being able to eat or what have you because the hotel forced them to provide their own card for payment or they wouldn't be allowed to stay.\n\n**TL;DR:** How can I make sure hotels never charge my freelance workers for their stays and ONLY charge our corporate credit card with which we pre-booked (and in some cases pre-paid) for their room?\n\n## Comment ID je6jfpi with +28 score by [(jeswesky, Reddit, 2023-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/je6jfpi/) (in reply to ID 125xllt):\nI do all the travel booking for my company and I used to work front desk at hotels.  Yes, you are doing it wrong.\n\nIf you want to cover the cost of the hotel, you have a couple of options.\n\n1. Contact the hotel and request a credit card authorization form.  Complete the form and return to them.  This will allow the hotel to charge either the room/tax or all charges to the credit card on file, depending on which you indicate on the form.  \n2. If you regularly book at specific hotels, reach out to their sales department and ask to set up a direct bill account.  When booking, make sure to indicate that this is a direct bill for room/tax or all charges to the preset account.\n\n## Comment ID je6isbq with +9 score by [(pocketpocket, Reddit, 2023-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/je6isbq/) (in reply to ID 125xllt):\nIf you're always booking the same property reach out and ask to speak to their corporate sales manager - you can try to arrange a negotiated rate and maybe direct billing (if they approve it).  \n\nOtherwise, when you book a room for someone, phone the property and ask for a credit card authorization form. Many hotels will not charge your card without additional proof of legitimacy (so as to avoid fraudulent transactions and charge backs). You will likely have to do this for every guest.\n\n### Comment ID je7b6ww with +1 score by [(peanutismint, Reddit, 2023-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/je7b6ww/) (in reply to ID je6isbq):\nThanks, yeah as I mentioned I have been filling out those authorisation forms but it doesn't always seem to work, plus it's uneconomical of my time to have to do that for every guest so I'd love it if there was a better way but understand if there's not.\n\n#### Comment ID je7pkl1 with +3 score by [(trisarahtops05, Reddit, 2023-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/je7pkl1/) (in reply to ID je7b6ww):\nunfortunately unless you go through sales and set up some sort of continued relationship (which will involve picking a hotel that isn't just the closest one), your resvs are no different than any other guest. if you want the personalized treatment you're expecting of either your travel agent or the hotel staff, you're going to have to understand that it's not uneconomical to pay a few more miles for your workers in exchange for not having to spend time on the phone getting billing sorted.\n\nthere are crew guys I see every week or often enough that I'll send upstairs and worry about attaching their corp cards when I'm not busy later bc that relationship has been established, and then there are guys who are new or infrequent that have sat in my lobby for an hour at 9pm on the phone bc their boss didn't set up the billing right and they don't have the money for incidentals.\n\n## Comment ID je6gnhb with +5 score by [(Canadianingermany, Reddit, 2023-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/je6gnhb/) (in reply to ID 125xllt):\nThe credit card you provide is typically for the guarantee (ie. the noshow charge if the guest fails to show).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn order to have your corporate credit card charged, you need to do one of the following:\n\n1. Book a prepaid rate (at a hotel that actually pre-charges your credit card at booking)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2)  Confirm to the hotel in writing explicitly what charges you want to be billed centrally to you and charged to your corporate credit card.  Typically a signed letter on letterhead will be sufficient, but some hotels have a form you have to fill in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3)  In some hotels you can get central billing as part of a negotiated rate (if you have enough volume).\n\n### Comment ID je6iqvg with +7 score by [(Hotelroombureau, Reddit, 2023-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/je6iqvg/) (in reply to ID je6gnhb):\nTo add on to this, particularly with prepaid or direct billing options your guests may still be required to give a card at check in for incidentals, so personally I’d always go for option 2. Credit card authorization forms grant you the most flexibility and if you fill it out for all charges the guest won’t need to provide a card at all. \n\nThis isn’t a foolproof method, because human error on your end as well as on the hotel’s end is a thing, but imo it’s the most surefire way to ensure you have the flexibility to cancel when plans change (a definite drawback to option 1), as well as determine how much of the stay you’re covering (a potential drawback to option 3)\n\n#### Comment ID je7bknv with +3 score by [(peanutismint, Reddit, 2023-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/je7bknv/) (in reply to ID je6iqvg):\nThanks for the tips guys. Just out of interest, if anyone shows up at a hotel with a pre-paid room but then refuses to provide a credit card for incidentals etc, does that stop them from being allowed to check in? I feel like I've declined the 'pre-charge' thing before (where they say \"can we place a $250 hold on your card in case you get stuff from the mini bar?\") without them causing a big fuss, but I wonder if I should just tell my staff to stop giving their own card for a deposit... Would the hotel just have to default to using the card they have on file from the booking then? Or might they say \"no card no room\"?\n\n### Comment ID je6l4kf with +6 score by [(reb678, Reddit, 2023-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/je6l4kf/) (in reply to ID je6gnhb):\nYou can also provide the hotel with a credit card authorization form giving the hotel permission to charge a card that is not present.

Not only will it make future bookings more seamless but once you reach a certain number of room nights per your you can get group rates even for individual rooms.\n\nAt the company I worked for we had both corporate sales and property sales and the international clients that were frequently booking rooms at various properties went through corporate who then passed everything to the property.\n\n## Comment ID je821ge with +2 score by [(SkwrlTail, Reddit, 2023-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/je821ge/) (in reply to ID 125xllt):\nOne thing to remember about hotels is that they'll often be running an 'Authorization Hold' on a card. If your employees are using a Debit card, this will show up as an immediate transfer of funds, and this can take days or even weeks to come back to their cards. (Credit cards work differently and are much preferred by the hotel industry because of this) Thus, *even if the whole thing is set up perfectly*, your employees may see a hefty Authorization Hold on their cards.\n\nThe Incidentals card getting run for the fees is actually pretty common. The parking fees, resort fees, wifi fees are all *preauthorized* upon the guest's card at checkin. If they're also adding a heavy incidentals (usually if the place has Room Service and other costly things) that can add up quickly.\n\nThe Incidental card getting run for the entire stay is usually due to inattentive or lazy hotel staff. They're on autopilot - greet person, get card for person, run card for the room, give keys. The employees should be very clear that the room and tax and all fees should go onto your company card, not theirs.\n\nThere is one option, though it's a bit risky. On those Credit Card Authorization forms, you can usually indicate that it's for All Charges. Make it VERY clear to your staff that they're not to be abusing that. This way your employees don't have to add their own cards, but has the chance that someone will run up a big bill.\n\nThere is also the hybrid option. Have the authorization for All Charges, Then once the employee is given the keys (and all those pesky authorization holds have been applied), they then add their own card to the account *without* it being authorized. Just 'on file'. The hotel staff can then add any other charges such as breakfast or the like to the employee card, secure in knowing that if it doesn't go through, your company card will be there.\n\nBut yeah, talk to the hotel directly to make sure that it's all being set up properly.\n\n## Comment ID je8tboe with +2 score by [(Top_Of_Gov_Watchlist, Reddit, 2023-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/je8tboe/) (in reply to ID 125xllt):\nEasiest thing to do is contact the hotel directly early the day your guest are to arrive. Get them the credit card authorization form. And have the hotel charge the card right then for all your guest while you're still on the phone. \n\nSorry that the process is inconvenient. However me being the front desk employee cant risk a several thousand dollar charge back. That would probably be my job. \n\nIf you end up staying at the same hotels generally the staff will know you and your guest. And they will know you're legit and won't think twice about charging the card on file.\n\n## Comment ID l6yote8 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/l6yote8/) (in reply to ID 125xllt):\nDo not use hotelengines aka hotel engines.

I can gladly hold while you find it.\"\n\nI definitely would suggest picking 1 hotel in a city with 2 back up locations and speak with their sales teams. \n\nAnother suggestion is to fax or email the credit card authorization 24 hrs prior and day of arrival. Typically try to include the cc and matching driver's license as they will accept that as a more qualified cc auth. Hotels typically work on day of things first then move to the next weeks operations.\n\n### Comment ID je7c4zf with +2 score by [(peanutismint, Reddit, 2023-03-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/125xllt/new_to_booking_hotels_for_my_staff_and_constantly/je7c4zf/) (in reply to ID je6j8ix):\nHonestly I'm not one of these people who has a 'favourite hotel chain' (although Marriott's internet login system ALWAYS sucks and I'll stay anywhere that leaves out free cookies) and I don't think my business cares either; we prioritise being close to the work venue so, as long as it's not a Motel 6, we're gonna pick location over 'brand' so setting up/staying loyal to any one supplier probably isn't a point of order for us.

      "# Post ID 18wykdu: 3rd party website booked the wrong dates for my stay. Nobody will refund me. with +157 score by [(True_Nectarine5875, Reddit, 2024-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/18wykdu/3rd_party_website_booked_the_wrong_dates_for_my/)\nHi everyone.  I booked a hotel stay at the Sheraton through traveluro.com and for some reason the dates they booked for me were not what I entered.  I've contacted them exhaustively and they claim no fault of their own and tell me the booking is non refundable and can't be altered.  Called the hotel they say their hands are tied due to it being booked through a 3rd party and they can't refund or change dates. \n\nObviously the biggest lesson I'm taking away from this is not to book through 3rd parties anymore.  But in the meantime is there anything else I can do to save my $350? I would think it's an ironclad case for a chargeback since I didn't choose the dates they booked but I worry something like that would be impossible to prove and the bank would reject my attempt.

I'm curious about how much of a savings \"Traveluro\" or whatever offered as opposed to just booking a Sheraton directory with Marriott. \n\nFrom the word \"dates\" I'm guessing it's at least 2 nights. So, $350 is $175 per night if only 2 nights. At 3 nights, we're looking at under $120 each.\n\nWhat was Marriott's usual rate?

There's a reason why you're not supposed to get a receipt from FD at check out if you booked 3rd party- those 3rd party companies do not want guests to know what they paid the 3rd party vs what the hotel actually got paid (read: it's quite a bit different).

That's all automatically sent when you process the booking. Double check your dates in the future. In terms of a refund, you prolly won't get one as you are the one that selected the dates on the website, but hotels are usually more lenient with date changes than cancelations on 3rs parties.

The whole process is automatic so it's unlikely that Holisto (parent company of Traveluro) had any direct involvement with your reservation. From the hotel's perspective, they are correct in saying that their hands are tied in terms of a refund. My advice would be to see if there's any way they could move the date and you pay the difference / a fee such as the commission directly to the hotel? They might not be happy doing this because of the way the hotel receives the money from third parties, though. If it is non-refundable and non-amendable then it is a bit of a pickle that you're in. I think what most likely happened (which I know to have happened before) is guests select a date and the booking engine occasionally defaults to a different date when you go on to the next stage. Assuming you realised and started contacting as soon as the reservation was made?\n\n## Comment ID kg17qbf with +15 score by [(LompocianLady, Reddit, 2024-01-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/18wykdu/3rd_party_website_booked_the_wrong_dates_for_my/kg17qbf/) (in reply to ID 18wykdu):\nAre you certain you didn't make the mistake of switching month and day?

Only to magically immediately book you *different* dates and provide email confirmation of those different dates. \n\nI worked for AMEX years ago and had to oversee and help with issues in concierge and travel for the centurion (black) card … I never once in all my years and thousands of instances of looking into fuck ups had a case where the person/agent/customer booking didn’t accidentally fuck it up despite vehemently denying it. Everything is recorded and id have to go through the screen recordings, etc…. Not *once* was it an instance where they correctly navigated everything … got to the final confirmation screen with all the correct info … pressed submit … and boom … different dates booked. More often than not the website was confusing and/or reverted to different month/dates during the booking process at some point but it *always* showed the wrong info before hitting submit.

If it's confusing, that's a design flaw.  If it reverts to different dates on it's own after they've been entered but before final confirmation, that is also a design flaw.\n\nI find it bizarre to place the moral responsibility for that on the consumer who doesn't catch it.

If so then yes, do a charge back with the credit card issuer. You are going to be out the $350 until a decision is made. The worst case, you are still out the money. Best case it is refunded. Why not at least try?\n\nIf no, you are SOL dude. You need to pay better attention. It is a hard lesson and pretty expensive too. It sucks and I would be upset in the same situation. \n\nIf you do the chargeback do not place blame. Do not whine, get pouty, or emotional. Facts are what you need to present. You booked a trip with company A for a hotel stay with company B. The dates company B have are inaccurate. You have made an attempt with both companies without getting your money back.

There are only a handful that corporate Marriott works with and negotiates for the whole company. That doesn’t stop companies like Traveluro from selling rooms though unfortunately. The reservations will be honored if they are properly communicated to the hotel by Traveluro, but since they are not a travel partner of Marriott, you really have no recourse with Marriott. \n\nNow, I would definitely issue the charge back. Presumably you have emails and such showing you attempted to get a refund and explain the situation. Worst case is that yes, you’re SOL but maybe it’ll work\n\nFor the future, always book with the hotel directly. Besides, with Marriott hotels, they have a best rate guarantee on their website which means you will ALWAYS get the best price booking direct. They are not allowed to offer discounts on Expedia, booking, etc. so at best, you get the same price and extra hassle. If you ever see a lower price from Marriott on a third party site, you can submit a claim (simply form online) to be compensated for the fact that you paid more on Marriotts website. That wouldn’t apply in this case since Traveluro isn’t a Marriott partner and they’re essentially selling stuff they have no authority to sell but just so you know in the future, you have nothing to lose by buying on Marriotts site directly\n\n## Comment ID kg2bnll with +2 score by [(kms1010, Reddit, 2024-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/18wykdu/3rd_party_website_booked_the_wrong_dates_for_my/kg2bnll/) (in reply to ID 18wykdu):\nAs lots of people have said, you might consider contacting your CC company. Also, as many have pointed out, could the date format have been the issue? FWIW, I always use the drop down calendar for bookings.

This is why before you submit, you need to recheck all of the information, including dates, and amenities, and other arrangements. Once you submit through a third party, and especially when reservations are non refundable, the hotels have no way to help. You are not the hotels customers.

I have never had an issue I always ask what type of room I want. I use flex pro and always get my money back if i need to modify and never have to worry about not getting refunded. maybe you should try it again... I earn rewards with marriott too with it. I've found its easier than going directly with the hotel. I dont wanna pick up the phone to talk to a front desk jerk."

Even though I was within the policy’s rules. I booked a hotel the had okay rating to find out I was put in a room with BED BUGS and I am told I am getting only half of my money back in travel credits whenever I asked for a full refund to my card.

Small pocket change but multiplied by thousands of transaction per day equal substantial profit margin. \nHotel Engine is a mediocre platform for hotel reservation. State of TX has a multi-year contract with Hotel Engine (HE) which makes no sense since it is a new player without a proven record. It’s better for State of TX employees to book direct with hotel because at least it gives them more choices. HE search result is very dishonest and misleading. On the mobile app, there is no way to filter out room that is not available on the search result so you end up wasting time clicking through each hotel to find it has room available. Prices are often higher than direct booking. I would not recommend this app to anyone unless you don’t have any other option.",

I found Hotel Engine a couple years ago and used their service every now and then.  They have pretty good deals and are competitive with the other companies out there in terms of pricing but was not my first choice cause I like to get points for my stays.  I try to book only Hilton family hotels so I can accumulate points and earn some free nights for vacations with the fam.  \n\nTo my surprise, Hotel Engine now allows you to use your loyalty number while booking!!! \n\nFor real this is a total game changer for me! Also they upgraded their mobile app and is now a million times better than the old one!! It seems Hotel Engine has listened to their users and delivered which can be pretty rare these days when dealing with these bigger companies!!! I don’t need to jump around anymore and download a bunch of booking apps as this is now my first choice!  Keep up the good work Hotel Engine!!! Glad to see you in full Phoenix form!!!",

That means decent rates but no hotel rewards at all. That means everyone in my company loses their elite hotel status which gives us all sorts of perks (no upgraded rooms, no upgraded internet, no free meals, the list goes on). \n\nIn summary, I’m begging my company to move away from this system after using them for less than a month.

A lot of us feel like our job security is always on the line, which is super stressful. The turnover rate is really high because the leadership is always on the lookout for who they think are “low performers,” and it’s tough to see good people leave all the time. Leadership tends to point fingers and play favorites, which doesn’t help with trust or accountability. They also seem to have a very simplistic, results-only approach that doesn’t handle big issues well, leading to half-baked solutions. The pressure to perform is intense and relentless, and it’s definitely taken a toll on morale and led to burnout for many.\n\nIn a nutshell, while the company is doing great in terms of growth and product success, the internal culture and leadership style make it a tough place to feel secure and supported.",

They structure an unattainable an ever-increasing monthly quota that's always positioned just 1-2 months beyond reach, as to ensure that even though you're making them more and more money, they're invariably paying you less and less commission. They needlessly waste so much of your time with unnecessary internal meetings that continuously derail your day, detracting you from effectively managing your time and actually being able to successfully do your job. They offer \"Unlimited PTO,\" but then gaslight and punish you for ever actually wanting to use any of it ... They possess a cult-like mentality led by Leader Elia Wallen and his Inner Circle keeping the majority of employees in the dark, contributing to fundamental breaches in interdepartmental communication, and ultimately not allowing one hand to see what the other hand's doing.

In the ended trying to save themselves saves no one. \n\nExpect to be fired with no notice or severance, especially if you joined the company in the last 1-3 years. It will also be right before the one year mark to prevent any equity vesting. Only a few of the original hires are in control, everyone else is strategically kept in a revolving door to come in with fresh ideas and perspective, then kicked out once those have been shared. \n\nThere is a ramp time needed for ICs, managers, VPs, and C-levels: Hotel Engine does not care about these. You can be putting in 12+ hour days and they will fire you tomorrow. I’ve seen leadership turn down strong candidates because they said they prioritize time with their family on weekends. Their DNA listed on the website is far from reality and measured based on whether you’re “in” with the OGs. \n\nWhile the product is outstanding (minus the customer support issues and often getting double charged with no resolution) and in high demand, this company puts on a grandiose facade to the outside world, but is a disaster internally.

In the ended trying to save themselves saves no one. \n\nExpect to be fired with no notice or severance, especially if you joined the company in the last 1-3 years. It will also be right before the one year mark to prevent any equity vesting. Only a few of the original hires are in control, everyone else is strategically kept in a revolving door to come in with fresh ideas and perspective, then kicked out once those have been shared. \n\nThere is a ramp time needed for ICs, managers, VPs, and C-levels: Hotel Engine does not care about these. You can be putting in 12+ hour days and they will fire you tomorrow. I’ve seen leadership turn down strong candidates because they said they prioritize time with their family on weekends. Their DNA listed on the website is far from reality and measured based on whether you’re “in” with the OGs. \n\nWhile the product is outstanding (minus the customer support issues and often getting double charged with no resolution) and in high demand, this company puts on a grandiose facade to the outside world, but is a disaster internally.

You can be gone in the blink of an eye.\n- the expectations are SKYYYY high. Almost unreachable. People absolutely work weekends, overtime, through dinner with family. But that is the bar they set, and if the executive team has to do it, so should you.\n- they live by their weird DNA traits and will bring those up as things to do and study. Basically everyone needs to perform at a CEO level.\n- as much as people say they love what they do here…listen to the crack in their fake smile after they say it. The sigh after you join a meeting with them at 10am and they say they’ve been in back to back meetings with the inevitable “you know, it’s a Monday!!”.\n- they don’t ever know what they actually want.

      "# [Hotel Engine Achieves $2.1B Valuation With $140M Permira Investment by Engine on 2024-09-17](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/17/2947398/0/en/Hotel-Engine-Achieves-2-1B-Valuation-With-140M-Permira-Investment.html)\nDENVER, Sept. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- With new products and a new brand on the horizon, travel technology leader Hotel Engine today announced a $140M Series C growth investment led by Permira Growth Opportunities II, a fund advised by global private equity firm Permira.\n\nHotel Engine will use the funding to support ongoing product development, including the launch of flight and rental car bookings to its platform. The new booking options will go live in October, making Hotel Engine an all-in-one solution for business travel.\n\nAlongside the new product release, Hotel Engine will change its name to \"Engine\" to reflect its expanded focus.\n\n“Hotel bookings will always be in our DNA, but we’re out to transform the entire travel experience,” said Hotel Engine CEO Elia Wallen. “We want to become the engine of business travel. Our new name will reflect that, and with Permira’s latest investment, we’ll be better positioned than ever to turn our ambitions into reality.”\n\nDenver-based Hotel Engine has quickly become a go-to option for business travelers thanks to its industry-leading tech and innovative features like consolidated invoices, coverage for incidentals, 24/7 customer support, whole-company trip insurance and free travel-management software to help customers save time and money. Hotel Engine’s contract-free approach with no minimums or agent-assist fees makes adoption easy for businesses of all types and sizes.\n\nHotel Engine connects business travelers to a robust network of more than 750,000 hotels, 300 airlines and 40 rental car companies. Travel providers are also able to use Hotel Engine’s Partner Hub software platform for free which enables them to provide special offers to business travelers, manage reservations, create marketing campaigns and benchmark against competitors.\n\n“We are proud to have built a platform that benefits everyone,” Wallen said. “In addition to the value we provide to businesses, we also help hotels raise their visibility and build relationships with business travelers worldwide through our Partner Hub platform.”\n\nIt’s a winning strategy. Hotel Engine has used only $20M of outside capital to reach its current $2.1B valuation, up from $1.3B at its Series B in November of 2021. The company is profitable, experiencing 70% year-over-year revenue growth at scale, and is on track to book over 10 million room nights this year.\n\nPermira Principal Alex Melamud has joined Hotel Engine’s Board of Directors.\n\n“Hotel Engine is a category leader in more ways than one,” he said. “They’ve figured out how to provide the benefits of managed travel without the downsides such as contracts, minimum spend requirements and extra support fees, and they’ve also created a business that appeals to both travelers and suppliers like hotels, airlines and car rental companies. We are confident that Hotel Engine has miles of room to run, and we’re excited to be part of the journey alongside Elia and his team,” commented Melamud.\n\nAbout Hotel Engine\n\nHotel Engine, soon to be “Engine,” is radically simplifying business travel by providing software that saves companies time and money without the hassle of contracts, agent-assist fees or minimum spends.

      "# [Hotel Engine Rebrands as Engine with Engine.com by Elliot Silver on 2024-09-17](https://domaininvesting.com/hotel-engine-rebrands-as-engine-with-engine-com/)\nIn June, with the help of DomainTools, I noticed that the Engine.com domain name was pending transfer and the nameservers had recently changed to Cloudflare. This valuable domain name transferred to Cloudflare, where it is currently registered under Whois privacy.\n\nWe now know who acquired Engine.com.\n\nAccording to an article in Fortune today, Hotel Engine is rebranding itself as Engine. The Engine.com domain name now forwards to HotelEngine.com. I suspect that will reverse when the company fully rebrands in October.\n\nThe reason for the rebrand seems pretty simple – Hotel Engine as a brand was too limiting. People only expected to book hotel rooms on Hotel Engine. Rebranding as Engine while acquiring the generic Engine.com domain name allows the company to offer additional travel services without confusion. This is outlined in a FAQ on the splash page visitors to Engine.com land on:\n\n“When we started this journey, we focused on revolutionizing hotel bookings for businesses. But our customers asked for more, and we listened. Our evolution into Engine marks our expansion into full-service business travel solutions for our customers. With the addition of flights and cars, our customers can manage all their business travel on a single platform.“\n\nPrior to the transfer to Cloudflare, Engine.com had been registered under Whois privacy at GoDaddy. Prior to that, the domain name was owned by a domain investor I have known for many years. I will reach out to him to see if he was the seller, and if so, if he can comment on the sale price.\n\nRight now, I have no idea what the company paid to acquire the Engine.com domain name. I would not be surprised if it was well into the 7 figures (or more). I think it is similar in nature to the recent sale of Rocket.com.\n\nPerhaps the sale price will be announced one day. Until then, kudos to the team behind this great rebrand. The company is now reportedly valued at $2.1 billion.",

      "# [Business travel startup Hotel Engine reels in $140M at $2.1B valuation by Maria Deutscher, MIKE WHEATLEY, JAMES FARRELL, DUNCAN RILEY on 2024-09-17](https://siliconangle.com/2024/09/17/business-travel-startup-hotel-engine-reels-140m-2-1b-valuation/)\nHotel Engine Inc., the operator of a hotel booking platform for business travelers, today announced that it has closed a $140 million Series C funding round.\n\nPrivate equity firm Permira led the investment at a $2.1 billion valuation. That’s up from the $1.3 billion Hotel Engine was worth following its previous raise in November 2021. The startup says that it has spent only $20 million of its venture funding to achieve the $800 million valuation bump.\n\nDenver-based Hotel Engine operates a cloud service that companies can use to book accommodations for employees embarking on business trips. It provides access to rooms at 750,000 hotels through a search bar that can filter results by property type, amenities and other criteria. It’s possible to book accommodations for individual travelers, groups or events.\n\nHotel Engine differentiates its platform from the many other business travel tools out there by offering several financial incentives to customers. Companies don’t have to buy memberships or sign minimum spending commitments. Additionally, Hotel Engine provides the ability to cancel and shorten trips without incurring financial penalties.\n\nThe company also offers more conventional incentives. Purchases are worth points in the royalty programs of both Hotel Engine and the hospitality companies that list their properties in its platform. Additionally, the software maker provides discounts that it says can reduce the cost of a hotel stay by up to 60% in some cases.\n\n“They’ve figured out how to provide the benefits of managed travel without the downsides such as contracts, minimum spend requirements and extra support fees, and they’ve also created a business that appeals to both travelers and suppliers like hotels, airlines and car rental companies,” said Permira principal Alex Melamud.\n\nAlongside its cost-cutting features, Hotel Engine provides tools for speeding up the administrative work involved in business trips. One tool allows companies to consolidate multiple hotel bills into a single invoice to simplify accounting. There’s also a feature for managing incidental deposits, which are used to cover hotel expenses not included in standard room charges.\n\nHotel Engine says that its platform is used by more than 40,000 customers, including PepsiCo Inc., Whole Foods Market Inc. and other major brands. Those companies rely on the software to plan business trips for about 700,000 workers. Hotel Engine says that bookings on its platform are on track to exceed 10 million room nights this year.\n\nAlongside its flagship travel platform, the software maker provides a free business management application for hotel operators. A hospitality company can use the latter product to bid on group travel contracts and run marketing campaigns. There are also features for related tasks such as comparing a hotel’s performance with rivals.\n\nHotel Engine disclosed on occasion of today’s funding milestone that its annual revenue growth rate exceeds 70%, off an undisclosed base. Moreover, the company is profitable.\n\nTo maintain its business momentum, Hotel Engine plans to expand its platform with features for booking flights and rental cars. The new capabilities are set to roll next month. In conjunction with the update, Hotel Engine will become simply Engine as part of a rebrand meant to reflect that its focus is expanding beyond hotel bookings.",
      "# [Hotel Engine CEO Talks Growth After $140 Million Fundraise by Justin Dawes on 2024-10-03](https://skift.com/2024/10/03/hotel-engine-ceo-talks-growth-after-140-million-fundraise/)\nHotel Engine recently raised one of the year’s largest rounds of capital for a travel startup: $140 million, which valued the firm at $2.1 billion.\n\nThe Denver-based company provides a tech platform that travel managers use to book business trips. Historically, the focus has been on hotel bookings, but flights and car rentals are joining the mix starting this month. Once that happens, the company is dropping “Hotel” from its name and will go by Engine to reflect that expanded focus.\n\nThe company also offers hotels tech tools for bookings management, marketing, dynamic pricing, and more.\n\nHotel Engine is focused on small- and mid-sized companies in the U.S. Skift spoke with its founder and CEO, Elia Wallen, about what comes next.\n\nThe Competition\n\nHotel Engine has a lot of competitors. Navan, based in New York City, most recently raised $154 million in equity at a valuation of $9.2 billion. This year, Navan hired a former New York Stock Exchange executive as its CFO ahead of an anticipated IPO.\n\nTravelPerk, based in Barcelona, most recently raised $104 million at a valuation of $1.4 billion.\n\nThere’s been some significant M&A activity, as well: Amex GBT earlier this year announced plans to acquire CWT for $570 million.\n\nAll of these companies have been growing and expect to continue. But especially for small- and medium-sized companies — which is where Hotel Engine is focused — there’s still a lot of business up for grabs.\n\n“It’s a really big market, and there’s going to be a lot of winners and a lot of losers — you see these little companies pop up and down all the time,” Wallen said. “I think once you get to a certain scale, that there’s room for everyone, and we’re going to carve out our corner of the market.”\n\nThe Global Business Travel Association expects travel spending to exceed pre-pandemic levels of $1.4 trillion this year and exceed $2 trillion by 2028.\n\nBusiness Growth\n\nWallen said that Hotel Engine is seeing 70% growth in revenue compared to last year. And he projects “triple-digit” growth next year. The company is on track to sell about 10 million room nights this year.\n\nAbout 5% of the company’s business comes from outside the U.S. With the three product lines, the company will ramp up its effort abroad in 2025, he said.\n\nHotel Engine has 700 employees right now, and he expects to hire another 300-500 in the next year.\n\n‘We’re Cash Flow Positive and Profitable’\n\nThe company raised $65 million in 2021 at a $1.3 billion valuation and raised $16 million in 2019 at a valuation of over $150 million.\n\nHotel Engine had spent only $20 million of that total before it raised its most recent round, Wallen said.\n\n“All the money that we’ve raised has not just hit the balance sheet and been lit on fire, as many do.” Wallen said. “A lot of people have to keep raising money every year to keep the lights on. We’re cash flow positive and profitable.”\n\nA small portion of the latest funding went toward the balance sheet, but the majority was raised as a secondary offering, he said, which essentially allows early investors and employees to cash out some of their holdings. Completing a secondary offering is often a sign of financial health for the company because it shows it doesn’t need outside capital to continue operations.\n\nThe round was led by a growth equity fund under private equity firm Permira.\n\nWhat’s Next: More Products, AI, and Maybe Acquisitions\n\nHotel Engine has been focused solely on hotels, but Wallen said customers wanted a place where they could more purchase products in one place.\n\n“The first five years, it was heads down, build the best network we can with our hotel partners,” he said. “As we had this nice foundation of lodging, it was the next natural evolution. Most people are expecting three in one.”\n\nThe platform also has a feature for booking large groups of rooms, such as for a corporate event. And the company recently opened that feature to consumers, who can book blocks or rooms for at least nine people. He believes there’s more opportunity in that specific area of the sector.\n\n“It’s a pretty broken space,” Wallen said.\n\nUsers should also expect to see more AI integrations.\n\n“We are definitely investing heavily there. And I think we’ll see how far it goes. The story’s being written currently.”\n\nHotel Engine doesn’t have a team dedicated to searching for M&A right now, but the company is going to start considering those types of deals.\n\n“We’re fully organic to date – we haven’t done any acquisitions. But just given the dynamics of the market … it does seem like there’s a higher probability that it happens next year than ever before.”",

      "# [Business Travel Startup Engine Hits $2.1B Valuation After $140M Series C by Chris Metinko on 2024-09-17](https://news.crunchbase.com/travel-tourism/business-travel-startup-engine-series-c-permira/)\nEngine, formerly Hotel Engine, booked a $140 million Series C led by a fund advised by private equity firm Permira that values the Denver-based startup at $2.1 billion.\n\nThe new valuation represents a 62% jump from its previous $1.3 billion value after a $65 million Series B in late 2021.\n\nThat increase is no small feat considering many startups are still raising money in flat or even down rounds from their sky-high valuations during the record venture market of 2020 and 2021.\n\nIt also shows the continued bounce back of business travel — one of the sectors most greatly affected by the COVID pandemic and one that has taken time to eventually return.\n\nGrowing and rebranding\n\nEngine’s platform connects business travelers to a network of more than 750,000 hotels, 300 airlines and 40 rental car companies. Those travel providers also use the company’s platform to provide special offers to business travelers, manage reservations and create marketing.\n\nThe company is profitable and is growing its revenue 70% year over year. The company will use the fresh capital to support product development, including the launch of flight and rental car bookings to its platform.\n\nThe company also announced it will rebrand to “Engine.”\n\n“Hotel bookings will always be in our DNA, but we’re out to transform the entire travel experience,” said CEO Elia Wallen in release. “We want to become the engine of business travel. Our new name will reflect that, and with Permira’s latest investment, we’ll be better positioned than ever to turn our ambitions into reality.”\n\nThe new round is the largest raised this year by a travel business startup, surpassing the approximately $106 million Series D Spain-based TravelPerk closed in January, per Crunchbase data.\n\nFounded in 2015, Engine has raised $221 million, per Crunchbase.\n\nRelated Crunchbase Pro list:\n\nLargest Rounds By Business Travel Startups",

      "# [Exclusive: Hotel Engine reaches a $2.1 billion valuation, rebrands as Engine by Allie Garfinkle, Nick Rockel, Leo Schwartz, Sheryl Estrada, Andrew Nusca, Alena Botros, Kali Hays, Beth Greenfield, Ryan Hogg on 2024-09-17](https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/exclusive-hotel-engine-reaches-a-2-1-billion-valuation-rebrands-as-engine/)\nWallen started Hotel Engine as a subsidiary of corporate housing company Travelers Haven in 2015, meeting a long-standing customer request—assistance with hotel bookings. Wallen founded Travelers Haven in 2008 (the company reached $100 million in revenue in 2022, and was acquired by Blueground in 2023). But over time, the Hotel Engine side project gained more and more traction, becoming impossible to ignore.\n\n“As these stories sometimes go, the little brother became the big brother,” said Wallen. “You hear stories about these products that people build as little side things, then they grow—and that’s essentially what happened. So, I moved over to Hotel Engine full-time in February 2020. We raised our first money in the summer of 2019, and that was actually the first money I ever raised.”\n\nWallen’s gambit has paid off. The company today reached a massive milestone: Hotel Engine has raised a $140 million Series C led by Permira, Fortune can exclusively report. The funding bumps its valuation to $2.1 billion, up from $1.3 billion during the 2021 round. With new investment in hand, Hotel Engine will now expand beyond hotels, launching flight and rental car booking capabilities to its platform in October. The Denver-based company will accordingly change its name to reflect the wider focus, becoming Engine.\n\n“We joke internally that whoever named this company wasn’t thinking big enough,” said Wallen. “Hotel Engine, when it was tucked under Travelers Haven, made all the sense in the world. I wasn’t considering that it would get this big, so the name change really goes along with that.”\n\nAnd Engine has indeed grown, coming out on the other side of the pandemic profitable. The company is currently seeing revenue growth of 70% year over year and says it expects to book more than ten million room nights in 2024. Wallen is also eyeing areas of possible expansion once the company’s move into flights and rental cars is settled.\n\n“Groups is one that I should touch on,” he told Fortune. “The group industry, it’s meetings, conferences, and events. It’s a very, very big space. It’s very broken and very manual. You’re planning a wedding, what do you do? You’re going to research a handful of hotels right near a venue, and maybe the venue is a hotel. Then, you’re literally going to pick up the phone. We have the most modern platform for that business. It’s growing very fast so we believe groups is going to be a very big opportunity.”\n\nOne of the most striking things about listening to Wallen is his exceedingly measured approach to raising capital. He tells me that, to date, Engine has spent less than half of the $56 million in primary funding the company raised before this new round.\n\n“I don’t think companies should take money unless they really need it, unless there’s really product-market fit and you need it for scale,” Wallen said. “I think so many people do it for all the wrong reasons. They do it because they think they’re supposed to. They do it for ego or pride… It’s just that we’re conditioned as entrepreneurs and there’s so much self-doubt out there—and it’s dangerous. But a lot of people want to do the right things, and they do it because they think it’s right.”\n\nThen again, it’s perhaps not striking so much as consistent—that moderated approach has been a recurring theme for Wallen, who seems to operate sans Silicon Valley hype. That even goes back to the ways in which the success of Engine so far has been the byproduct of a happy accident, followed by execution and hard work.\n\n“There was never a moment where I was thinking, ‘Oh, this is going to be huge,’” said Wallen. “We just kind of built it, and I even almost shut it down a few times, because Travelers Haven was already such a successful business and growing fast. You always hear ‘focus, focus, focus on where you put your time and energy’—but that’s where the outcomes will happen.”\n\nElsewhere… Luminate Capital, the software-focused fund from Hollie Haynes, has bought AbsenceSoft.

He previously founded Travelers Haven, which provided corporate housing solutions, before pivoting to focus on Hotel Engine full-time in 2020.
