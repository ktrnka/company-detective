I’ve been looking, too, and I have seen communications jobs posted recently, which might be a good fit for you.\n\nRemember that it’s INCREDIBLY competitive and hard to get a job at Disney. Most full time, non seasonal employees will tell you that you really have to know someone to get your foot in the door. That being said, don’t give up!

Find a temp agency or wait tables to get by. I would imagine the industry is very competitive and hard to break into. I bet they would want someone with an expansive portfolio and real knowledge about the inner workings and history of the parks, along with keeping up with the current ongoings at Disney. If you want to set yourself apart, your probably going to need to work harder then everyone else to get what you want.

And we can have leia and Han too. It's animated so no need to worry about live action recasting.\n\nThere is so much lore and a bunch of Disney comics they could adapt. Luke and Ben training along with going on adventures. The other padawans as side characters. Or maybe full fledged character development for some of them into supporting main cast.\n\nAnd by like season 3, we could get snoke infiltrating Ben's mind and all that. Also the guy Ren who was the leader of the knights before Kylo. His influence on Ben. And the confrontation he had with Luke and Ben. Could even be a side plot of Snoke building up the first order.\n\nShow ends with the destruction of the temple. Or maybe a final season focusing on Snoke and Ben's initial training. And Leia and Han dealing with the direct aftermath of Ben falling to the dark side.\nIf done right this could easily be a 10/10 show.\n\n#### Comment ID ld0od7o with +1 score by [(NumeralJoker, Reddit, 2024-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1e039kz/a_new_star_wars_animated_tv_show_seems_to_be_in/ld0od7o/) (in reply to ID lcm2xyw):\nYeah, the potential a show like this has is massive, even with the sequel controversies.\n\nDo something to establish Luke's legend. Show us his peak power. Show us how he kept the peace durint the ABY20s era. Show him and Ben heroically saving worlds and keeping the Galaxy a more stable, better place for a few years, even if some of it falls apart later.\n\nYou can always have the impact of what they did show up in post sequel content too. You can set up plot threads in the show that extend beyond episode IX to make Luke's impact even more relevant, reducing a little bit of the resentment some fans would have of him being \"passed over\" so to speak. It also makes the fall of his temple more tragic, and could plant threads that Rey would pick up on later when rebuilding the order (again) herself.\n\nIMHO, a Jedi centric show set from 23ABY-28ABY would fill in the gap nicely, take place after the Mando era, and finally be the bridge we needed for all 3 trilogies to start to work better as a saga. It would reinvigorate interest in the franchise from older fans and bypass some of the sequel hate by giving people who were disappointed by Episode VIII more of what they'd hoped to see, but in a less shallow, better fleshed out way. It allows for great creativity by focusing on enemies who are not the Sith or even the First Order (most of the time), yet still could be new, great threats in their own right. It justifies more of Luke's \"legend\" status that he's so cynical about by Episode VIII, and you could see additional reasons why he may have emotional struggles that go beyond just the fall of Ben. Plant the seeds of doubt and fear in him just a little bit.\n\n### Comment ID lckygjv with +4 score by [(darthsheldoninkwizy, Reddit, 2024-07-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1e039kz/a_new_star_wars_animated_tv_show_seems_to_be_in/lckygjv/) (in reply to ID lck16ya):\nMaybe Shadow of Sith adaptation, that would be cool.\n\n### Comment ID lckn5hr with +8 score by [(Maldovar, Reddit, 2024-07-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1e039kz/a_new_star_wars_animated_tv_show_seems_to_be_in/lckn5hr/) (in reply to ID lck16ya):\nYou'll get more clones and you'll like it\n\n#### Comment ID lckt9jg with +6 score by [(Nonsuch42, Reddit, 2024-07-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1e039kz/a_new_star_wars_animated_tv_show_seems_to_be_in/lckt9jg/) (in reply to ID lckn5hr):\nNoooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n\n#### Comment ID ld4ulfu with +1 score by [(ObliWobliKenobli, Reddit, 2024-07-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1e039kz/a_new_star_wars_animated_tv_show_seems_to_be_in/ld4ulfu/) (in reply to ID lckn5hr):\nYes please thank you very much.\n\n### Comment ID lckd3hz with +8 score by [(Pixgamer11, Reddit, 2024-07-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1e039kz/a_new_star_wars_animated_tv_show_seems_to_be_in/lckd3hz/) (in reply to ID lck16ya):\nPlease No more Prequels to the trilogies Just do Something far back or in the far Future nothing We.have in Disney Canon right now\n\n#### Comment ID lckq380 with +16 score by [(CurseofLono88, Reddit, 2024-07-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1e039kz/a_new_star_wars_animated_tv_show_seems_to_be_in/lckq380/) (in reply to ID lckd3hz):\nAre you telling me you wouldn’t watch a show about Bor Gullet escaping Jeddah just in the nick of time and then flying through the galaxy, meeting friends and foes, knowing the truth but no longer a soldier in Saw Gerrera’s war.

Not a full series. The timeline is way too restrictive. Awesome stuff with great future potential can't really exist, and we've got more than enough Jedi alive during that time that it stretches how extinct we felt the Jedi were during the OT. Let that be a mini series or a book or a story arc in something ongoing (like a comic). We've got Cal, Omega, Grogu and other force sensitives setup for the future. We also don't need MORE Inquisitor content. A bunch of younglings and preteens trying to find The Path as they run from boring Inquisitors sounds boring. \n\n\nI disagree about OT trio (though eventually they should make it) and PT. Yet again more highly restrictive eras, characters and oversaturated eras. Not to mention get something just a bit wrong and you've got outcries and criticisms galore, x1000 if the characters are the OT trio. \n\n\nNo, instead, I say go Old Republic, New Republic (post EP 9) or High Republic. Honestly the High Republic seems overly restrictive as well, with what they can do with the Sith and dark side to be strictly limited.\n\n#### Comment ID lck61fj with +4 score by [(M3rc_Nate, Reddit, 2024-07-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1e039kz/a_new_star_wars_animated_tv_show_seems_to_be_in/lck61fj/) (in reply to ID lck5xej):\nBut, regardless of all that, I think what interests me a lot, which has been setup most recently, is adult Omega.

They have different requirements for certain positions especially if you're working at animal kingdom to work with the animals, being a Disney character, wedding planner, etc.\n\n### Comment ID hm733xm with +6 score by [(Medical_Jaguar4963, Reddit, 2021-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyWorld/comments/r2twap/how_do_you_get_hired_at_disney_and_what_is_it/hm733xm/) (in reply to ID hm72ofo):\nDefinitely at the parks.

The CEP application process takes about 5 months from the time you apply to the time you are accepted, then another 3 months before you actually move down there.\n\nIt was pretty life changing for good and bad. My previous employment background was far above the tasks required of my job in WDW so I found it really easy and excelled at it. I spent a good portion of my shift interacting with guests so my people skills and communication got way better.\n\nThe best part though were my program housing roommates. I now say I have 5 extra brothers and a sister, we are quite close and I go out to visit them on the east coast once a year!\n\nThe biggest downside to it was having to come home. For a lot of international college program participants this is one of the only times they’ll go to WDW so having to leave is difficult and the post program depression is real. I’m lucky in that I live next door to the USA and can go to WDW or DLR every couple years, but I still fell into a pretty bad funk after having to say goodbye to my job and roommates in Florida.\n\n### Comment ID hm9ybii with +2 score by [(Medical_Jaguar4963, Reddit, 2021-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyWorld/comments/r2twap/how_do_you_get_hired_at_disney_and_what_is_it/hm9ybii/) (in reply to ID hm9kitx):\nCould you have stayed on?\n\n#### Comment ID hma4lvr with +2 score by [(IDriveAZamboni, Reddit, 2021-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyWorld/comments/r2twap/how_do_you_get_hired_at_disney_and_what_is_it/hma4lvr/) (in reply to ID hm9ybii):\nNo.\n\n### Comment ID hmauv91 with +2 score by [(frecklestwin, Reddit, 2021-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyWorld/comments/r2twap/how_do_you_get_hired_at_disney_and_what_is_it/hmauv91/) (in reply to ID hm9kitx):\nI did a CP in summer 2019!

I went to UCF and worked at WDW through college in hopes of becoming an imagineer.\n  \nFirstly, he will need to attend college (which he can do through Disney's Aspire program for Cast Members for free) and get a degree - I got an engineering degree.\n  \nNext. Having Disney on the resume definitely help, which he already has.\n  \nThird, be willing to leave the company to get experience. There are countless people with Disney on their resume that leave to get experience elsewhere then return to the company - these people will likely be hired over him if he remains a janitor when he has a degree.\n  \nLastly, have him set up meet and greets with people in the company. Tell him to use Rostr on the Hub to find people in positions that he wants to learn more about. I did this multiple times and they were always incredibly accommodating, kind, and willing to offer advice.\n  \nOne thing - the industry is incredibly cutthroat - my girlfriend and numerous friends held internships and actual positions in WDI, and so many of them individually said that it felt like their peers would sell them for recognition.\n\n### Comment ID jtxsuv0 with +43 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jtxsuv0/) (in reply to ID jtxs4i7):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID jtxu272 with +149 score by [(president_of_burundi, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jtxu272/) (in reply to ID jtxsuv0):\nThe -neering part of Imagineering is for 'engineering'.

But there are the resorts, new project build up, and a lot of other things that come into play before an engineer or architect even set foot on a project or things after they’re done that still have to be done.\n\nSpatial design, environmental design are also jobs that fall under imagineering.\n\nI do agree with possibly having to work elsewhere and coming back.  My cousin did the college program, left for another job, and then was asked personally by his former manager to come back to Disney.  He gained a lot of experience in his short year away as well.\n\nIt really depends on where within WID he’s interested in working, but he should absolutely start making it known he’d like to improve himself, he’s considering going back to school, and asking for advice.\n\nWID is highly competitive in terms of just hiring even though so it’s important to remember that.  And also remember that even if he’s not under the WID umbrella there are many other positions under the WDC umbrella that are not specifically at/with the parks.

This can be anything from Production Design, to Engineering, to Project Management, to sculpting. There are truly so many different roles/positions and potential backgrounds. \n\nThe key is taking your background/strengths and learning how to apply them to the themed entertainment industry. So it absolutely isn't just for engineers.\n\nBut let me ask - does he want JUST a job at imagineering? Or would he be happy working for other parks doing the same thing?\n\nThere are a few things to remember - the industry will favor industry work experience very highly. This is where starting from complete scratch is hardest - if you have little to no experience in entertainment arts, or on high-level projects it will be much harder to be an attractive candidate.\n\nThere are also very (very) few ways to get into the industry by chance. The best way is through an internship.\n\nWhat is your brother's undergrad in? What strengths does he bring to the table that would be attractive to WDI?

The thing to understand is that at its basic level, WDI is a design-build construction company.  They just happen to have a single client, and built really cool stuff.  \n  \nThere are jobs ranging from engineers, construction managers, to finance, to lighting, AV, graphic design, and production.  Getting in is tough, but not impossible, and it’s never too late!  It helps to know people as they get 1,000’s of applications for any opening, networking is key.  The best way to do that is if they know what their specialty will be, is to look for people on the HUB in those positions and respectfully ask for meet and greets.  \n  \nIf they’re going back to school, consider switching to a WDI internship.

And don’t get me wrong…I understand why it’s like this now and not everything can (or should) be done in house, but it was not what my young mind had believed Imagineers were doing.

There is a “skunkworks-esque” R&D division that creates a lot of the effects, but like everything else, those plans get patented then contracted out.  Buena Vista Construction Co. is WDW’s Construction company is rarely used by WDI.  To your point, WDI primarily does the design, and then  robustly oversee’s the build.  With engineers constantly traveling all over the world to ensure quality when components are being manufactured.  \n  \nThe pro’s are very obvious, you get to help build rollercoasters, cruise ships, hotels, and affect the Disney Skyline.  I was in Finance but was in rooms driving discussions with literal Disney legends.  Leadership was incredible, very demanding, but you were working with the best so everyone was in on the mission.\n  \nThe cons were few, namely there were “chosen ones” who seemed to rise up quickly.  There was definitely a corporate game to play.  With that said, the reason for my departure was for a promotional opportunity within WDW Finance that I couldn’t pass up.  The pandemic caused my ultimate departure from Disney.

Each section of the ride will be a scene from the movie, which we have broken down in to these X number of scenes. This scene will have such and such water feature. This scene will be black light. etc. There will be X number of animatronic figures in scene A,B,C, etc. Your budgetary constraints are XYZ. This ride will not leave ground level and the target demographic will be all ages, especially stroller age children and their families.\n\nI have a feeling a LOT of us dreamers want it to be A, but it's more B. How do you get a job being the idea person in option B that brings the ideas to WDI? Like the Toy Story ride is amazingly fun and not just a retelling of the movie. The themeing is impeccable, even in the queue with the oversized toys. How did that ride go from idea to existing? \n\nI left the field of Architecture early in my career because I learned quickly that clients usually brought in very specific ideas and my main function was to take their idea and make it real. I was allowed a little input, but not much. To be the 'mindblowing idea guy' as an Architect, like becoming the next Frank Lloyd Wright or something, you had to be more salesman than engineer; convincing the client your grand idea was better than their idea. I quickly learned I'm not a salesperson type personality, even though I had great ideas and a lot of artistic design talent and even enjoyed the process of taking general ideas to constructed reliable reality.\n\nAnd honestly, my personal experience and critique of the Little Mermaid ride is exactly how I describe it in B. Very dull. But hey, I'm not the target demographic. I'm an middle age fart that likes rollercoasters and thrill rides. Plus I'm not bitter at all for the loss of the Norway or Submarine rides, I promise! /s (ha ha). The challenges of taking someone else's idea and making it a reality does bring it's own thrill and enjoyment, but I don't think the general public thinks in these terms when they hear \"Imagineering\". Or am I wrong?\n\n#### Comment ID ju05qlt with +4 score by [(gnuoyedonig, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/ju05qlt/) (in reply to ID jtz82xm):\nI feel this depends on where you sit in the development of things. In concept roles, there are no programmatic limits to what you can dream up. If you’re more an engineer, graphic designer, architect, costumer, show set construction or painter, production etc. the exploration of the ride system, concept, etc. might be pretty well defined by the time you are participating.\n\nBut for a ride like Toy Story, there might be 3, 8, 20 however many ideas dreamed up by the concept people, all different ride systems explored, new things tried out - until the practicality of execution sets in and the ideas are narrowed down to one that can be built.\n\nIncidentally this process is just really the creative process you would find at a branding agency, in television or film, advertising, software development and more - just on an enormous scale with an emphasis on nothing being impossible for the creative idea early on. Once you learn how to do this in the Disney context it’s applicable to every creative industry and you can be the star of their problem-solving.\n\n#### Comment ID ju0dnfl with +3 score by [(vtfb79, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/ju0dnfl/) (in reply to ID jtz82xm):\nThere’s also a lot of data that gets analyzed.  What rides are starting to be ignored, what restaurants and shops are underperforming, what facilities have hit the end of their useful life? As u/gnuoyedonig mentioned, it’s like a branding agency’s creative process and there’s about 20 ideas to every location on property at a variety of scales.  Have had the opportunity to participate in some of the brainstorming/creative workshops when they’re idea gathering.  That process is worthy of a Masterclass.  \n  \nThe sad thing though is when a project starts going though the “Gating” process (Blue Sky idea to approved project with a budget) is seeing what gets left behind.  I was I able to see the original concepts for Guardians, Ratatouille, and Mickey’s Runaway Rail.  While the final product is great, so many cool (and expensive) ideas were cut out.  If you think a new attraction is awesome, you should have seen the original idea.\n\n### Comment ID jtz1djr with +3 score by [(orioles0615, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jtz1djr/) (in reply to ID jty0x92):\nAre the salary ranges as bad as Google says.

Is it possible? Absolutely. If we're being realistic though? It's going to be a tough sell.\n\nFirst of all in order to get any sort of job in the industry, let alone at WDI, you'll have to be VERY self-driven and self-motivated - your brother should be the one driving these conversations. These aren't jobs you just stumble into - it takes people sometimes decades to break into the industry after non-stop work and dedication. These people are often experts and extremely talented in one specific area, and highly talented in multiple others.\n\nThe chances of him jumping into a role at WDI are very \\very\\ low. Impossible? Absolutely not, but it's exceedingly low.\n\nUnless your brother has a secret hidden card, or an obscure talent which is in high-demand he will at the very least need to go back to school and help define his skill-set. From there his best bet would be to apply to internships with WDI, but even then they are extremely and wildly competitive, and do not guarantee a future. \n\nThe problem is your brother's best bet at getting a job in WDI is by NOT getting a job with WDI and working elsewhere at any number of vendors/design firms until he breaks in. So does your brother want to work in the industry, or just WDI?\n\nIf he just wants a future with WDI then the venture is almost certainly not worth it - you'd be putting so much on the line for such a low chance. I encounter people like this constantly - they spend years trying to break into the industry, but only want to work at WDI/UC, and when they get a job at neither, they end up miserable and unhappy.\n\nMeanwhile the people who are open to working at other vendors and design firms and play the long-game, that truly love the industry and work, they are happy, and many-times they end up in places like WDI and UC.\n\nYou have to love the INDUSTRY, not just the company.\n\n\\He knows A LOT about Disney's history and has had a lot of jobs within hospitality.\n\nThis sounds like he'd do great as a tour guide, or as others have suggested a \"Plaid\" at Guest Services. What good is the park the Imagineers dream up and build if the talent to make it come to life isn't there?\n\nThe front-line workers are essential to maintaining the magic. Perhaps that is where he will fit into the picture best?\n\nAs an industry professional - my best advice is that HE needs to not only sit down and understand what WDI does, but where he sees himself clearly fitting into that picture. It can't be \"the ideas guy\" - it has to be a skilled professional path that can be practically applied to the work being done. From there he would best be served by pursuing this academically and leveraging that from there. \n\nMy most truthful advice to him though is to explore all of the in-park jobs and positions that Disney offers. There are plenty of non-WDI positions which have significant bearing on the park, it's future, and the overall experience. All of these will be tough to get into, but will be MUCH easier than WDI. He can also check out the sub-divisions of the parks like Disney Live Entertainment, the holiday events team, guest services, and senior park operations.\n\nIf he is truly interested in the Themed Entertainment industry as a whole and would be happy working anywhere, and not just WDI, then I say that is when you start exploring the steps to breaking into the industry. \n\nWithout knowing what your brother is good at, and what he enjoys and is skilled at - it will be extremely hard to give any sort of advice. There might be only a handful of positions, but there are a thousand and one ways to get started into getting into WDI - each one with different advice and requirements. Once he figures that out, and can see himself happy dedicating everything to that for years to come, then it’s time to talk things like education, and industry related events (TEA Mixers, IAAPA, etc..,) But again - he has to love the industry, and not just WDI.\n\nAnd I do have to ask, after 5-8 years, what if he is no closer to realizing the dream of becoming an imagineer? Will he be happy and grateful for the journey? Or will he feel like he wasted time and made a mistake?\n\n### Comment ID jtzrn4g with +5 score by [(retlaw_yensid, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jtzrn4g/) (in reply to ID jtyhc98):\nFellow mouse in the industry here, this guys response is it exactly.

Only a tiny portion of those have the capability to fit in at Imagineering and contribute something new to the company.\n\nWhen I was at Imagineering I had a front row seat for the hiring process both for my department and the larger division we were in. The Directors and managers were absolutely savage with those resumes - I’ve never seen resumes ridiculed in an organization so openly. It was bitter and ugly. That doesn’t mean they were horrible people to work with - I think it just comes from long hours of resume review that had to occur constantly if your department was hiring. And the ridiculousness of the ask on the part of the applicant.\n\nI did my share of resume review and there were so many where the person had no related experience doing the kind of creative work related to the position they were applying for, but in their cover letter they expressed how working for Imagineering was a dream they had since their first park visit, or how they built a model of a ride that pretty much was one of the existing rides with the storyline from a different Disney movie applied. These get old fast - and it’s next to impossible to see how that person would end up contributing anything new to the company.\n\nDisney doesn’t want to hire people who imagine themselves building things similar to what already exists, they want people who can create brand-new things, never before seen. Really innovative ideas.\n\nThere was almost a trap for people who loved what Disney already was, and I saw lots of these people stagnate in their roles and not move forward.  People who acted ambivalent about Disney history raced ahead. One guy who showed actual contempt for the parks became an executive level creative, and maybe it was because he was not so in love with things he could bring a new perspective.\n\n## Comment ID jty56z0 with +12 score by [(Colt_kun, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jty56z0/) (in reply to ID 15crb7m):\nImagineers are a highly sought after position and cover a lot of fields - architecture design, interior design, costuming and textile work, artists, storytellers, engineering, and others I can't think of right now. Today's imagineers usually (but not always) require advanced degrees and impressive portfolios. But it's not impossible, just a long road.\n\nOne imagineer I got to speak to during the build of New Fantasyland said he started by volunteering at a community theater and building stage props! So there's loads of roads. Just have to go back to school in the field he wants and find applicable ways to get it on his resume. Document everything for his portfolio. And as others have said, getting some Disney work on there will help.\n\nHe may want to start by digging out some of the Disney books on attractions - Haunted Mansion and pirates are two I read - to see what went into building them. There's some cool behind the scenes documentaries out there too. Just so he can get an idea of what all encompasses the Imagineering role.\n\nGood luck to him!\n\n## Comment ID jtxp57g with +10 score by [(strawbabies, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jtxp57g/) (in reply to ID 15crb7m):\nhttps://themeparkarchitect.com/how-to-become-a-disney-imagineer/\n\n## Comment ID jtyhd5c with +5 score by [(doctrsnoop, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jtyhd5c/) (in reply to ID 15crb7m):\nI know for a fact that even fully qualified people are very unlikely to get there.   I also know that being an Imagineer doesn't guarantee much from year to year.  If heart set of being imagineer almost certainly guaranteed failure.   But Getting job skills and confidence is a great thing.   anything more is gravy.  Also , the track to imagineer doesn't have to involve working for Disney the whole time.\n\nThere are many paths to take, most are reasonably valid.   Artistic, engineering, marketing, hospitality etc.   You don't really apply to be an imagineer.  You just get so good at one of these things and you \\*may\\* be thought of.\n\n## Comment ID jtzczb6 with +4 score by [(Yawheyy, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jtzczb6/) (in reply to ID 15crb7m):\nStep 1: Don’t be brand loyal. Although you can move up if you stay with the company, you may have a faster advancement rate if you move roles between parks. ie: Universal and Seaworld.\n\nIdk how Disney is, but at the other parks it is possible to move into technical roles from operations, without spending money on a degree. It’ll just take longer.\n\n## Comment ID ju09yxj with +5 score by [(adchick, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/ju09yxj/) (in reply to ID 15crb7m):\nImagineering is only one arm of the Disney company in Orlando.  \n\nHaving Disney on his resume will help, BUT he needs some sort of marketable skill beyond janitorial to make it into a desk job. \n\nWhat career does he want to have? “Knows a lot about Disney” is not a skill or a desk job.\n\n## Comment ID jty4c39 with +10 score by [(Interesting-Chef9078, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jty4c39/) (in reply to ID 15crb7m):\nlol good luck\n\n## Comment ID jty29vb with +9 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jty29vb/) (in reply to ID 15crb7m):\nYou have to be the best of the best to be an imagineer.\n\n## Comment ID jty5z7q with +2 score by [(_always_crabby_, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jty5z7q/) (in reply to ID 15crb7m):\n1. Do something he is passionate about.\n2. Get really good at it and gain experience in it.\n3. Find a niche that sets you apart from others in your field.\n4. Apply to a role that could use his expertise.\n\nImagineering is just one of the orgs in the company where he can have a large impact. Ask, why imagineering? Then ask, is there somewhere else in the company where he can be more impactful than imagineering? He will be happier where he can make a large measurable contribution than somewhere where he might have an impact. Sounds like hospitality would be an ideal fit. Have them buy into his ideas there and change things for the better.\n\nThere are regular business support jobs in imagineeting, but other than that they are niche positions within a domain.\n\n## Comment ID jtyapav with +4 score by [(Suitabull_Buddy, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jtyapav/) (in reply to ID 15crb7m):\nDoes he have the skills to be an imagineer?\nIs that a realistic goal?\nIf yes, then start asking Disney what he can do, or at least try to show them what he is capable of.\n\n## Comment ID jtz0esa with +8 score by [(Late-Consequence3575, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jtz0esa/) (in reply to ID 15crb7m):\nLmao this person thinks they’re going to get a step by step guide to becoming an imagineer on the WDW subreddit\n\n### Comment ID jtzcx6b with +7 score by [(wifichick, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jtzcx6b/) (in reply to ID jtz0esa):\nWhere we are ALL trying to get that job\n\nHonestly, if the guy knows a LOT about Disney history and can combine that with a good memory for where everything is in the parks - that’s a good combo for disney tour guides.\n\n#### Comment ID jtzr0es with +4 score by [(Late-Consequence3575, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jtzr0es/) (in reply to ID jtzcx6b):\nYeah fair point.

Pick a field that he will be interested in for the rest of his life. Something he could do for a career even if it wasn’t at Disney.\n\n2. Go to college for a degree specifically in that field. Batchelor’s at the very least. WDI likes experienced specialists.\n\n3. While in college, he can take advantage of the [ImagiNations](https://disneyimaginations.com) competition and internships IN HIS FIELD ONLY at Disney or other companies. I’d promote other companies at this stage above Disney depending on the field, because he will learn more and having other companies looks far better on your resume than having only Disney. They are a solid F company for the field I was in and a lot of my colleagues left for other, higher caliber, companies. He will need experience when he comes to WDI.\n\n4. Graduate and get hired. I would really suggest going to other companies after graduation to learn how to actually do the job in his field since, as I hinted at before, Disney isn’t the best place to learn that. I noticed a DRASTIC difference between those who graduated and went straight to Disney and those who graduated and went to a better company and then went to Disney. Those that went straight to Disney had no idea how to get things done. It was sad to see. Honestly, I felt bad for them because they would really struggle if Disney laid them off or they wanted to apply to somewhere else.\nApply for roles related to his field at [jobs.disneycareers.com](https://jobs.disneycareers.com) or apply to other companies. Getting hired immediately after graduation is critical. The most important thing at this point is getting QUALITY experience as quickly as possible.\n\n5. If he’s dead set on Disney, reach out to recruiters on LinkedIn and they should be able to hone down to the specific recruiter for the role and his field in general to help with other open positions.\n\nA word of warning. The old days of WDI are LOOONG gone. You can search for posts from ex-WDI CM’s on LinkedIn for a more detailed perspective about that. Don’t let your dreams and the propaganda WDI documentaries crush the reality of what working for WDI actually is these days. There’s also a TON of other fantastic, and imo better, companies to work for in the Themed Entertainment Industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID ju8tpnh with +1 score by [(Steve_Supremo, Reddit, 2023-07-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/ju8tpnh/) (in reply to ID 15crb7m):\nWork and career aside… if HE doesn’t believe it’s possible, there isn’t enough planning in the world that will help him. What I would do is help build his confidence by maybe making some smaller short term goals that he can achieve. Nothing crazy but something that you and he can track and complete. Once he sees he does have the ability to do “X”, level him up to something a little more difficult. Eventually that may help his own belief system. \n\nI just hate to see you do all this work for him to say, “I can’t”. That mentality will get him no further than he is today. He’s gotta believe in himself FIRST. I commend you for helping him solve his confidence issues."
