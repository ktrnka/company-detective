      "# [Adventures By Disney](https://jobs.disneycareers.com/adventuresbydisney)\nAbout Our Trips:\n\nEach adventure has its own unique character that will appeal to different people. Some of our trips focus on the outdoors, with whitewater rafting, horseback riding and hiking being some of the optional activities. Other trips will explore highlights of cities, with historical tours, theater and gourmet meals.\n\nTrips range from 7 to 14 days in length, depending on the destination.\n\nAccommodations are among the best an area has to offer.\n\nThe platform for all trips is the authenticity of experiencing the destination while incorporating magical Disney touches and surprises.\n\nTo learn more about our destinations visit adventuresbydisney.com.\n\nAdventures by Disney Season\n\nThis year our peak season for running adventures is from May through August, with some destinations operating year-round.\n\nWho Are Our Guests?\n\nThe Adventures by Disney™ business is founded on family vacations.\n\nWe anticipate most of our guests are fans of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts® and Disney Cruise Line®, and will be looking forward to a Disney quality experience with the spotlight on the region that we are visiting.\n\nDepartures vary, but each group size will have approximately 30 - 40 guests, with a third of these being children.\n\nDaily Routine\n\nAn Adventure Guide's day will usually begin early in the morning. Before meeting with the guests, Adventure Guides are busy setting the stage and making final preparations for a great day.\n\nThe majority of the day will be spent with the guests, participating in activities, taking photos, attending meals, and addressing their varying needs. Throughout the day, Adventure Guides are the key to creating a seamless and magical experience for our guests.\n\nIn the evening, it's time to sit and have dinner with the guests while enjoying engaging conversations. Then, it's back to tying up the loose ends and confirming all the details for the following days of the trip.\n\nCo-Guides\n\nOn all of our departures, there should be two Adventure Guides working together to create a successful adventure.\n\nAdventure Guides should be respectful and professional with all of their co-workers. This is vital to ensure Adventure Guides can enhance the guest experience. Different styles and personalities are supported and candid feedback is encouraged.\n\nKnowledge\n\nThe Adventure Guides on our team will come from various professional backgrounds with diverse skill sets. However, all Adventure Guides should be thought of as experts in relation to their knowledge of the destination and Disney overall. Skill levels will vary and it is each Adventure Guide's responsibility to enhance their own skills and hopefully support their teammates in the pursuit of furthering their knowledge.\n\nAreas of expertise should include language ability, cultural and natural history, regional cuisine, travel industry logistics, basic knowledge of technology and the desire to work with people of all ages. Adventure Guides are expected to participate in all guest activities and therefore must be comfortable participating in Junior Adventurer's games and programs, swimming, hiking, bicycling, kayaking and other outdoor activities.\n\nAvailability\n\nTo be considered for the position of an Adventure Guide, you must be available to Adventures by Disney™ for travel between May through August. You will also be required to attend a week-long training session prior to beginning your trips.\n\nAdventure Guides will typically work a number of trips with slight rest periods between departures.\n\nThe amount of work will depend on our business need and an Adventure Guide's availability.\n\nTraining\n\nAll successful candidates who are hired will be expected to attend our training program. This consists of Adventures by Disney training and/or field based destination training.\n\nAll Adventure Guides will be required to complete (or show valid accreditation of) CPR and First Aid certification prior to leading a trip in the field.\n\nDisney Look\n\nAs representatives of The Walt Disney Company, Adventure Guides are expected to adhere to our appearance guidelines, which we call the \"Disney Look.\"\n\nThe Disney Look stems from Walt Disney's idea that cast members should be part of the show, but should not become the show. As such, the guidelines in the Disney Look are designed to help our cast members appear friendly, approachable and professional.\n\nThe Disney Look will be discussed in detail during the interview process, but here are some examples of the guidelines to which our cast members must adhere:\n\nVisible tattoos are permitted, with the exception of placement on the face, head or neck. Tattoos must be no larger than the Cast Member’s hand.\n\nJewelry is permitted provided it does not distract from the overall appearance and preserves the Guest experience. Two earrings in each ear are permitted.\n\nHair color must appear in natural occurring hues.\n\nFacial hair should be neatly groomed and well maintained.\n\nIf polish is used on nails, it should be the same on each nail and well maintained in one solid color or French manicure style.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow am I employed by Disney?\n\nAdventure Guides (new or current cast members) hired will be employed on a temporary basis as a Casual Temporary/Seasonal employee.\n\nHow much will I work?\n\nIndividual schedules may vary depending on the combination of itineraries assigned, language skills, personal interests, experience, performance history and seniority. As you grow with Adventures by Disney™, additional work could come your way in the form of more trips, administrative tasks or facilitating presentations.\n\nIs there opportunity for more work?\n\nAs a growing company, we are always looking to harness our resources. As you grow with Adventures by Disney™, additional work could come your way in the form of more trips, administrative tasks or facilitating presentations.\n\nDo I have to live where I am going to be guiding trips?\n\nNo. Generally, our Adventure Guides will reside throughout the United States and will be transported to the starting point of their trip departure prior to each adventure.\n\nDo I get to go home in between trips?\n\nIf you live in the area where you are guiding, you are free to return home in between trips when you are off duty. If this is not the case, a \"schedule-by-schedule\" approach will be taken to determine if and for how long an Adventure Guide should stay in an area in between trips.\n\nWho will I be guiding with?\n\nAll adventures are led by two Adventure Guides. You may be partnered with a local expert, travel industry professional or someone who comes from within Disney and splits their time being an Adventure Guide and whatever their role might be within the Company. Adventure Guides come from diverse professional backgrounds; however, they all share the desire to deliver exceptional guest experiences and the ability to relate to every guest on a personal level.",

      "# Post ID 7ucf5h: Logging my Disney career application journey with +14 score by [(scribbl3d, Reddit, 2018-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/7ucf5h/logging_my_disney_career_application_journey/)\nPlease start on the bottom and move up if you want to read from the beginning =) \n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: 16-JUL-2018\n\nI got the job! \n\nI received a few comments asking for an update and I'm shocked people were interested. I'm sorry it took so long for me to register that fact... \n\nSo let's back track. \nI had my interview and waited a couple of weeks before reaching out. I finally sent an email to the HR Recruiter on 21-FEB and she said unfortunately they moved on to another candidate. I was absolutely heart broken but I understood it was a competitive job. \n\n5 days later, I had already come to terms with it and moved on. However, I received an email with the subject: Wanna be an Imagineer?! I opened it and the recruiter told me that they had changed their minds and want to offer me the position! I was ecstatic and I screamed over to my boyfriend, \"I GOT THE DISNEY JOB!!\" \n\nAfter that, I had phone calls with the recruiter to confirm salary, benefits, etc. I put in my two weeks and I started at Disney Imagineering on 26-MAR. \n\n... And I'm still here! I'm so happy to have been hired and to be working with amazing, brilliant and creative people. It's been over 3 months and I still have a lot to learn. \n\nFor those of you considering this career, just know it's a lot of hours, work and a huge learning curve. Thank you for coming with me on this journey! I still can't believe I work here. I help make the magic! \n\n\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nUPDATE: 06-FEB-2018\n\nI had an interview! \n\nI received a call around 11am on 01-FEB. It was one of the recruiters for Disney Imagineering. She went through a series of questions like my experience, salary expectations, commuting issues, etc. Then she scheduled an interview for Monday, 05-FEB in the afternoon. Woo! I was so excited about the phone call I barely remember the conversation or what I said. But I do know that I was chatting away--I was ecstatic.\n\nCome Monday, I drive off to the location and I realized how far of a drive it was. It was over an hour long and there was a lot of traffic. I might have to move for this job but it's definitely worth it.\n\nI was greeted by the admin and led into a conference room. As much as I want to describe the inside of the building, I have a feeling that that will be breaking all kinds of Disney NDAs. But let me tell you... it was amazing! Colorful, with decorations and everything was Disney! I loved it.\n\nI met with three people, one of them being my potential boss, and it went well. Up until I had a disastrous coughing fit. I still have remnants of a cold and I couldn't stop coughing at one point. So embarrassing and that might have caused me to lose this job. But! it doesn't matter to me at this point. The fact that I was a candidate out of several hundred applications really validates how valued my skills and experiences are. \n\nThe interview lasted an hour and a half (I know, super long!) and it was really fun, we mostly discussed the differences in our industries and some more technical questions pertaining to my job.\n\nI hope I hear back from them, but if not, I am so grateful for the opportunity and I will not give up the dream of working for Disney!\n\nAlso I just checked the Disney careers website. All three of my applications are still considered \"Under Review\" even though I had an interview for one of the positions. So looks like they don't don't update the site very well. A bit of a shame...\n\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\n\n31-JAN-2018\nHi all!\nI hope that this belongs here.\n\nI want to document/log the amount of time it takes for Disney to get back to you in regards to \"Professional\" careers (like project management, planner, engineering, etc.). I couldn't find a whole lot of information on \"Professional\" careers so I want to offer you all my journey... Maybe along the way a fellow redditor with experience can guide me in the right direction or at least clear the fog that has been this application process.\n\nI have been working in the project controls (scheduling and cost) side for about 5 years now.  But I'm a little tired of my current industry (it's old-fashion and not innovative). I saw that Disney Parks and Resorts (Anaheim) was hiring in that department so I decided to give it a shot.\n\nI submitted my application (including resume and cover letter) on 19-DEC-2017.\n\nI've been checking frequently on the Disney careers webpage and looks like there are 5 stages to the application process. Stage 1 is Applied, Stage 2 is Under Review, Stage 3 is Interview, Stage 4 is Offer and Stage 5 is Hired. Pretty straight forward.\nSo far my status has remained \"Under Review\". I clicked on the job number provided and it gives more a little more detail, \"We are currently reviewing your application!\" Unfortunately, it's been over a month and I'm losing hope. But then again, I'm sure Disney received several hundred applications for this role so I need to remind myself to be patient.\n\nIf you so desire, I can keep you all updated on my career application journey! Or if you have any advice (like who I should contact for status--they keep this well hidden, and for good reason!), I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nUntil next time...\n\n\n## Comment ID dtj862z with +5 score by [(LuvzDizneyWurld, Reddit, 2018-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/7ucf5h/logging_my_disney_career_application_journey/dtj862z/) (in reply to ID 7ucf5h):\nno advice to give just wishing you the best of luck.\n\n### Comment ID dtj8o27 with +1 score by [(scribbl3d, Reddit, 2018-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/7ucf5h/logging_my_disney_career_application_journey/dtj8o27/) (in reply to ID dtj862z):\nThanks! :)\n\n## Comment ID dtjoa0b with +3 score by [(AimDizzle, Reddit, 2018-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/7ucf5h/logging_my_disney_career_application_journey/dtjoa0b/) (in reply to ID 7ucf5h):\nI applied for probably 50 internships with them a few years ago and went through several interviews.  It can take a long time to hear back.  Sometimes the application will stop at a step in their system and literally never move past that until they take the listing down.

Feel free to message/chat/comment if you have any questions or if I can help in any way!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1/19/22 - saw job posting on LinkedIn; applied on Disney Careers website.\n\n1/20/22 - recruiter reached out wanting to schedule an initial phone screening.\n\n1/24/22 - had my initial phone screening: he asked about my background, availability to start, salary. very basic stuff. he then said he'd be meeting with the team lead in 2-3 days and would be in touch to schedule an interview with him as a next step.\n\n2/2/22 - talent acquisition coordinator reached out to schedule an interview with the team lead.\n\n2/4/22 - had my 1st interview with the hiring manager. It was a very informal back-and-forth conversation where he got to know my background, my working style, and why I wanted the role. he then told me more details about the job and how he envisioned success within the role and the team. He said the recruiter would be in touch with next steps.\n\n2/11/22 - talent acquisition coordinator reached out to schedule two follow-up interviews.\n\n2/16/22 - had my 2nd interview with a tangential team member. again, an informal conversation where they got to know me, my interest in the role, and problem solving skills. they said the recruiter would be in touch with next steps.\n\n2/17/22 - had my 3rd interview with another tangential team member. informal conversation - they reviewed Disney's mission statement and employee values (from the website) and discussed their career path within the company. they said the recruiter would be in touch with next steps.\n\n2/25/22 - 4/24/22: I'd been emailing my recruiter periodically for status updates and received no response whatsoever. after a few weeks, my recruiter seemed to have switched roles - therefore, there was no direction on who to contact or what any next steps may be. my status on the job portal was still pending as a candidate.\n\n4/25/22 - the job req was reassigned to a new recruiter, who then reached out to connect with me and see if I was still interested in the role. he reviewed the job description and wanted to schedule a few follow-up calls, since my interviews were almost 2.5 months prior. \n\n5/10/22 - had a follow-up interview with the hiring manager. he explained how his team had made a few modifications on the role and wanted to review the updates. an informal discussion where we were able to touch base and how each of us felt about the role.\n\n5/16/22 - the recruiter reached out with an update; said that they wanted to schedule a final interview with a VP of the department. \n\n5/19/22 - had an interview with a VP of the department. he wanted to know more about my background and vision for the role, see how my professional goals aligned with the goals for the job, and provide perspective on macro business priorities. it was a casual conversation that lasted about 25 minutes. \n\n5/25/22 - received a job offer via phone!! the recruiter explained salary/benefits/perks/etc and then followd up with an official offer via email.\n\n## Comment ID ia0xs8a with +17 score by [(oliviamrow, Reddit, 2022-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/uxwzbd/interviewing_with_disney_a_timeline/ia0xs8a/) (in reply to ID uxwzbd):\nCongratulations!\n\nThat's long, but for what it's worth / for anyone reading this who's curious, it's not much longer than my experience in the past with two decently well known media companies- changes to the role slowed things down for you, but even just busy stretches in the department that needs to fill the position can also do that, especially if they're trying to backfill for someone who left and are therefore short handed.\n\nBest of luck to you in the new job, OP, assuming you're accepting :)\n\n## Comment ID ia1aaov with +5 score by [(Bearjupiter, Reddit, 2022-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/uxwzbd/interviewing_with_disney_a_timeline/ia1aaov/) (in reply to ID uxwzbd):\nCongrats on the role!

I've tried scouring the Disney Careers website and reaching out to people who have or currently work for Disney with no luck so I'm counting on you guys :)\n\nI've applied for a dozen jobs with the Disney company (ABC studios, ESPN, Walt Disney Studios) through the Disney Careers website and some of those applications are \"in progress.\" I'm really excited and hoping to hear back from the applications! normally, with a local job I'd follow up, or call in to see how the application process is going - is there anything like that I could do in this scenario? would you suggest that I not do that, or that I do something else entirely? What does \"in progress\" mean? In your experience, will I even hear from someone? Is it anything to be excited about?

It is not impossible but it is very difficult. \n\nI worked for WDI for a couple of years and all the hires I saw come in were either promotions/hires from within (very big at Disney and a method I approve of), high level/exclusive level skilled people and friends/nepotism. \n\nHow did I get in - nepotism. I had a relative that had worked at Disney since she was 18. First in parks as a character and slowly moving up the ranks until she was at WDI. She heard of a job opening I would be a good fit for, submitted my resume and called up the hiring manager a few times for me. \n\nAre you near a park or a store? Get a part time job at one of them, even if it is entry level. Work at it 6 months to one year and start applying again as an internal candidate. Disney is very much into promoting from within.\n\n### Comment ID csq4aay with +3 score by [(disneythrowaway60, Reddit, 2015-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/3bvvy4/a_question_about_the_disney_application_process/csq4aay/) (in reply to ID csq0wjy):\nI've been wondering if they're mostly internal.

It will eventually change to ask you to set up an interview or it  will say \"no longer in consideration\". Disney doesn't do follow ups just because their casting department is large and they have a ton of applications to go through, so you shouldn't have to worry there, just know they will eventually let you know.

I applied to multiple positions while looking for post-grad jobs and I was in progress with one. It ended up suggesting me to another position, but I think I was too far away for most positions since I would need to relocate.

Once the applications dropped for the internship program I applied the first day along with a ton of other people. Within 48 hours of my application being submitted, I had a web based interview (a WBI as its referred) and scheduled my phone interview. After my phone interview, my application sat in limbo for 56 days. Other people were getting acceptance letters within a week of their phone interview, others were getting NLIC'd (no longer in consideration). I had received a few \"your application is still pending\" emails which made me freak out because I went from In Progress to Pending. Low and behold, there is no difference between In Progress and Pending, so dont freak out if you get one of those emails. As I said earlier, 56 days later I did get my job offer.

      "# Post ID r2twap: How do you get hired at disney and what is it like working there? with +25 score by [(Medical_Jaguar4963, Reddit, 2021-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyWorld/comments/r2twap/how_do_you_get_hired_at_disney_and_what_is_it/)\n\n\n## Comment ID hm6pjuj with +15 score by [(ITrCool, Reddit, 2021-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyWorld/comments/r2twap/how_do_you_get_hired_at_disney_and_what_is_it/hm6pjuj/) (in reply to ID r2twap):\nWorking for Disney was a personal career goal of mine at one point. I wanted to work for their IT division. \n\nUntil all the layoffs happened. That dream has ended as I’d have no job security there. No matter how skilled I was. Not on a full time basis anyway.\n\nBut that’s different from working in the parks and DS, and such. What are you wanting to do?\n\n### Comment ID hm6w9j6 with +18 score by [(slickpretzel, Reddit, 2021-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyWorld/comments/r2twap/how_do_you_get_hired_at_disney_and_what_is_it/hm6w9j6/) (in reply to ID hm6pjuj):\nYou talking about the IT layoffs from around 10 years ago where Disney gave everyone a middle finger up their rear end or recently during Covid? \n\nFor anyone that doesn’t know they laid off their entire IT team, and forced them to train their overseas Indian replacements or they wouldn’t qualify for the severance package.\n\n#### Comment ID hm6xz37 with +11 score by [(ITrCool, Reddit, 2021-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyWorld/comments/r2twap/how_do_you_get_hired_at_disney_and_what_is_it/hm6xz37/) (in reply to ID hm6w9j6):\nThe former. That’s why my dream ended. I’ve since focused my IT career elsewhere. I still enjoy the parks and will continue to go, but any aspirations of being part of Team Disney have vaporized into a cloud of pixie dust. I had aspirations of being either a tech architect for the parks and resorts division of the company, or a project manager. Not anymore.\n\nCOVID was a bit more understandable. But hopefully they have a plan to hire CMs back soon. Or profits start to fall as people get tired of limited staff and leave (also guests get tired of the lackluster service due to overworked CMs who have every right to leave). But I’m getting off on a tangent on this post.\n\n#### Comment ID hmebnqe with +2 score by [(magic_man_iac, Reddit, 2021-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyWorld/comments/r2twap/how_do_you_get_hired_at_disney_and_what_is_it/hmebnqe/) (in reply to ID hm6w9j6):\nAlso I remember around that time they paid a consulting firm a ton of money to figure out what was wrong and when they came back with the answer that they need to get rid of the current IT management and walk back the outsourcing they completely ignored it.

I’ve worked QSFB in Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom, ODV (outdoor vending; popcorn and ice cream carts) in Epcot, and Custodial in Hollywood Studios. \n\nIt’s a LOT of fun. It can be very magical! But it is of course a job, and comes with everything a normal job comes with - rude guests, some shitty coworkers, and really really hard work. But also you get to be in Disney World every day, work with some of the best people, and have some very rewarding moments with guests. I had days where I came home glowing from the magic and days where I came home and cried because it was so tough. My first program I wanted to quit for a good two months but I stuck it out. Of course looking back I remember the good parts. It’s kinda like when a woman gives birth she forgets all the pain when she holds her baby, lol. \n\nYou apply online.

The CEP application process takes about 5 months from the time you apply to the time you are accepted, then another 3 months before you actually move down there.\n\nIt was pretty life changing for good and bad. My previous employment background was far above the tasks required of my job in WDW so I found it really easy and excelled at it. I spent a good portion of my shift interacting with guests so my people skills and communication got way better.\n\nThe best part though were my program housing roommates. I now say I have 5 extra brothers and a sister, we are quite close and I go out to visit them on the east coast once a year!\n\nThe biggest downside to it was having to come home. For a lot of international college program participants this is one of the only times they’ll go to WDW so having to leave is difficult and the post program depression is real. I’m lucky in that I live next door to the USA and can go to WDW or DLR every couple years, but I still fell into a pretty bad funk after having to say goodbye to my job and roommates in Florida.\n\n### Comment ID hm9ybii with +2 score by [(Medical_Jaguar4963, Reddit, 2021-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyWorld/comments/r2twap/how_do_you_get_hired_at_disney_and_what_is_it/hm9ybii/) (in reply to ID hm9kitx):\nCould you have stayed on?\n\n#### Comment ID hma4lvr with +2 score by [(IDriveAZamboni, Reddit, 2021-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyWorld/comments/r2twap/how_do_you_get_hired_at_disney_and_what_is_it/hma4lvr/) (in reply to ID hm9ybii):\nNo.\n\n### Comment ID hmauv91 with +2 score by [(frecklestwin, Reddit, 2021-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyWorld/comments/r2twap/how_do_you_get_hired_at_disney_and_what_is_it/hmauv91/) (in reply to ID hm9kitx):\nI did a CP in summer 2019!

But I thought I would give it a shot. I'm honestly just curious how one would go about getting a job in WDW or WDL with photopass. I did try searching the Disney Career website, but was unable to find anything. (I also experienced a lot of 'page not found' errors which was a little bit sad)\n\nI suppose it doesn't help that I'm not sure which category it would be in - media? Entertainment? Technology? Creative? (The categories are what generally gave me \"page not found\" errors.)\n\nI'm well past college, so the College program is not really a solution for me. If anyone can point me to some clear information on photopass hiring and hiring procedures I would be really grateful. Personal stories/experiences also welcome.

There is a wait list. Everyone wants photopass because it is considered a skill and you get paid more (not much though). You go through a pointless interview and then wait for your name to come up on the list. \nYou have to have ABSOLUTELY ZERO photographer experience. You go through the basic disney training, but then a week of photopass training. Your first 2-3 days are not even in a park, but rather a classroom learning the basics. They start off extremely slow - like how to attach the neck harness. Then you move on to the parks. Once you are in the parks, they audit everyone and make sure your composition and everything is up to par. But they teach you everything they want you to know and the shots they want you to take. You have to go through specialized training for characters, BBB, Pirate's League, roving etc. \nHope that helps!\n\n### Comment ID cbbuwq2 with +1 score by [(kecchin, Reddit, 2013-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/1j75t6/park_jobs_photopass/cbbuwq2/) (in reply to ID cbbtjvi):\nThat -does- help.

I know several people who have done it. I knew a few that had experience in photography and some that did not. Truth be told, disney would prefer you not to have a photography background. All they carry around is a tripod, camera (one lens), and a device that has a barcode scanner for the photopass cards. \n\nDisney, honestly wants to train the cast members how to do everything and do everything exact, no flair, no lenses, no diffusers. They want everyone to get a consistent photo experience. They want the same 20 shots throughout the park. They want to see no difference in photography from one cast member to the other. Really all the photopass cast member is for is to press the button and to make sure everyone fits in the shot. The pay is like of any other cast member (just a little above minimum wage). \n\nOne last thing, i am not sure if a wedding photographer gets any more money at the WDW resort that does weddings. DL does weddings too, but not as many and not as many packages as WDW has. \n\nTip: if you are a talented photographer, go into weddings. Good money can be made once you have good word of mouth. I know a few that make 1500-2500 a wedding and they do a wedding most weekends. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\n### Comment ID cbbuw8i with +1 score by [(kecchin, Reddit, 2013-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/1j75t6/park_jobs_photopass/cbbuw8i/) (in reply to ID cbburw9):\nPlease don't hate doing this, this is the type of answer I was looking for. I'm not dumb, I know the smiles and sunshine videos that are even part of the College Program's website (one of the few places I could find information at all) aren't the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth - they're the Disney truth. :) \n\nTo be honest, I have not really gotten into shooting -people-. It's something I'd like to think about sometime (hence, in some ways, the interest in photopass), but generally I have been doing scenery/landscape - and I have been told that in general I have a [good eye](http://osakaeye.blogspot.jp/) for composition. \n\nLong story short, I have been living in Japan teaching for five years, and now that I feel like I'm done here, I'm trying to find something I would actually -enjoy- back in the US. I like teaching actually - but I'm not even close to certified, and I really can't afford to re-do undergrad in order to be certified. So I started thinking about other hobbies and interests I have.

Remember get a full time job at disney from the beginning. Although disney does not pay well, it is awful when they not only dont pay well, they dont give you any hours either during off season.\n\nSecond, there are wages posted on the website. I would say take any type of job whether it be attractions, photopass, custodial and take the wage multiply by 3.2/3 for a month (taxes) and then see what it comes out to be. Then look at the housing and see if you can afford any housing and/or food. Most the time... not... you will need several room mates. DO THIS BEFORE MAKING THE PLUNGE! I cannot tell you how many people i worked with who could not afford basic necessities. One of my friends live 4-5 sometimes to a 2 bedroom. Could barely afford food and still drove his car without insurance and several tickets (i believe he even had a warrant out for all the tickets). Bottom line, he could not afford it. He loved it, but my love for the mouse only goes so deep. \n\nIf i were you and i wanted to get a job somewhere attempt to find a job with **tips**. You have teaching experience try to get a tutoring job, or a linguist job somewhere. I promise you, although you are not working for the mouse if you did and cannot survive it would be worse. \n\nIf you really after all that want to work for the mouse. Try to get a job in hotels (it pays higher). Or try to get a job higher up, Celebration if you want florida, Burbank if you want california. Those jobs will give you a salary that is at least manageable to live off of. \n\nAny questions, i would love to help you answer. \n\nBy the way, your pictures are very nice.\n\n## Comment ID cbbrxr0 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2013-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/1j75t6/park_jobs_photopass/cbbrxr0/) (in reply to ID 1j75t6):\nI didn't see anything on the Disney careers for photo pass.

Is it generally enjoyable? I think I read somewhere that they generally carry Nikon cameras - what other gear is carried? I'm guessing a back-up battery might be, but I don't know if they also carry a bevy of lenses and flashes, or just go with something standard.\n\n#### Comment ID cbbsayh with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2013-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/1j75t6/park_jobs_photopass/cbbsayh/) (in reply to ID cbbs2pw):\nThey really don't need a portfolio or a school background. It's preferred that you have some background of how to use a camera but not necessary as they teach you everything. They really are looking for passion. Show you have a passion for Disney and a passion for photography and you should be fine. If for some reason they don't think you have what it takes for photography, they'll probably give you an opportunity to have a different position and tell you what to improve for to get photo pass. \nAs far as gear, they really just use standard settings. They use one flash, one lens, and they are required to keep their ISO, F-stop, and shutter speed settings to a certain setting.",

They get hundreds if not thousands of applications for a job like animator, so it takes a while to get through it. :)\n\n## Comment ID hc7cz7r with +5 score by [(jellybloop, Reddit, 2021-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/pkwmmw/disney_application_process_question/hc7cz7r/) (in reply to ID pkwmmw):\nYou can always reach out to a recruiter and ask! \n\nI have applied to Disney twice, got rejected once and got it once. Both times it took several months before they got back to me. The time I did get it, it took 4 months from application to acceptance. And I believe that happened because someone else had beat me to the position but then wasn't able to accept it due to visa issues, so they had to sort that out, and then contact me as the runner up. Stuff like that happens all the time and it takes a while for them to work through the applicants. \n\nBut again, I would ask a recruiter personally. It could also just be that they haven't updated the system. If the position you applied to starts very soon or has already started, then it's likely that the info hasn't been updated yet and you haven't made it this time. But if it's still a while aways, then it's possible they're still working through applicants/accepted people until the position is definitively filled before they send out official rejections.\n\n## Comment ID hc7oq5q with +2 score by [(colorstoobright, Reddit, 2021-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/pkwmmw/disney_application_process_question/hc7oq5q/) (in reply to ID pkwmmw):\nI’ve interviewed at Disney for a non-Animation related job. They do take forever sometimes to reply, and that’s even before Covid. Be patient and apply to other jobs, don’t put all your eggs in this basket.\n\nGood luck!\n\n## Comment ID hc7bu28 with +1 score by [(EfficientGuarantee49, Reddit, 2021-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/pkwmmw/disney_application_process_question/hc7bu28/) (in reply to ID pkwmmw):\nTry not to stay focused on just applying online. If you can, go in and make yourself known that your interested in a position. It kind of gives a face to the application.\n\n## Comment ID hce0lz1 with +1 score by [(what1226, Reddit, 2021-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/pkwmmw/disney_application_process_question/hce0lz1/) (in reply to ID pkwmmw):\nFirst time I applied to Disney animation it was three months until my status changed to a rejection.  Second time it took a month until it changed to an \"under consideration\".\n\nApplying to Disney you just got to send and forget.  They take forever as I am learning.  \n\nIf your still interested in Disney, they are starting to post actual job opportunities for their new Vancouver studio (animation positions have no been posted yet).\n\n## Comment ID hi6p5m6 with +1 score by [(rhythm_lick, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/pkwmmw/disney_application_process_question/hi6p5m6/) (in reply to ID pkwmmw):\nI applied to the layout trainee on the 17th, and it went from \"under review\" to \"in consideration\" the next day. So I guess there really is no set time when it happens. I'm in the same boat where I'm just wait to find out if I'll get am interview or not. Lowkey freaking out over it haha"
