      "# [Adventures By Disney](https://jobs.disneycareers.com/adventuresbydisney)\nAbout Our Trips:\n\nEach adventure has its own unique character that will appeal to different people. Some of our trips focus on the outdoors, with whitewater rafting, horseback riding and hiking being some of the optional activities. Other trips will explore highlights of cities, with historical tours, theater and gourmet meals.\n\nTrips range from 7 to 14 days in length, depending on the destination.\n\nAccommodations are among the best an area has to offer.\n\nThe platform for all trips is the authenticity of experiencing the destination while incorporating magical Disney touches and surprises.\n\nTo learn more about our destinations visit adventuresbydisney.com.\n\nAdventures by Disney Season\n\nThis year our peak season for running adventures is from May through August, with some destinations operating year-round.\n\nWho Are Our Guests?\n\nThe Adventures by Disney™ business is founded on family vacations.\n\nWe anticipate most of our guests are fans of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts® and Disney Cruise Line®, and will be looking forward to a Disney quality experience with the spotlight on the region that we are visiting.\n\nDepartures vary, but each group size will have approximately 30 - 40 guests, with a third of these being children.\n\nDaily Routine\n\nAn Adventure Guide's day will usually begin early in the morning. Before meeting with the guests, Adventure Guides are busy setting the stage and making final preparations for a great day.\n\nThe majority of the day will be spent with the guests, participating in activities, taking photos, attending meals, and addressing their varying needs. Throughout the day, Adventure Guides are the key to creating a seamless and magical experience for our guests.\n\nIn the evening, it's time to sit and have dinner with the guests while enjoying engaging conversations. Then, it's back to tying up the loose ends and confirming all the details for the following days of the trip.\n\nCo-Guides\n\nOn all of our departures, there should be two Adventure Guides working together to create a successful adventure.\n\nAdventure Guides should be respectful and professional with all of their co-workers. This is vital to ensure Adventure Guides can enhance the guest experience. Different styles and personalities are supported and candid feedback is encouraged.\n\nKnowledge\n\nThe Adventure Guides on our team will come from various professional backgrounds with diverse skill sets. However, all Adventure Guides should be thought of as experts in relation to their knowledge of the destination and Disney overall. Skill levels will vary and it is each Adventure Guide's responsibility to enhance their own skills and hopefully support their teammates in the pursuit of furthering their knowledge.\n\nAreas of expertise should include language ability, cultural and natural history, regional cuisine, travel industry logistics, basic knowledge of technology and the desire to work with people of all ages. Adventure Guides are expected to participate in all guest activities and therefore must be comfortable participating in Junior Adventurer's games and programs, swimming, hiking, bicycling, kayaking and other outdoor activities.\n\nAvailability\n\nTo be considered for the position of an Adventure Guide, you must be available to Adventures by Disney™ for travel between May through August. You will also be required to attend a week-long training session prior to beginning your trips.\n\nAdventure Guides will typically work a number of trips with slight rest periods between departures.\n\nThe amount of work will depend on our business need and an Adventure Guide's availability.\n\nTraining\n\nAll successful candidates who are hired will be expected to attend our training program. This consists of Adventures by Disney training and/or field based destination training.\n\nAll Adventure Guides will be required to complete (or show valid accreditation of) CPR and First Aid certification prior to leading a trip in the field.\n\nDisney Look\n\nAs representatives of The Walt Disney Company, Adventure Guides are expected to adhere to our appearance guidelines, which we call the \"Disney Look.\"\n\nThe Disney Look stems from Walt Disney's idea that cast members should be part of the show, but should not become the show. As such, the guidelines in the Disney Look are designed to help our cast members appear friendly, approachable and professional.\n\nThe Disney Look will be discussed in detail during the interview process, but here are some examples of the guidelines to which our cast members must adhere:\n\nVisible tattoos are permitted, with the exception of placement on the face, head or neck. Tattoos must be no larger than the Cast Member’s hand.\n\nJewelry is permitted provided it does not distract from the overall appearance and preserves the Guest experience. Two earrings in each ear are permitted.\n\nHair color must appear in natural occurring hues.\n\nFacial hair should be neatly groomed and well maintained.\n\nIf polish is used on nails, it should be the same on each nail and well maintained in one solid color or French manicure style.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow am I employed by Disney?\n\nAdventure Guides (new or current cast members) hired will be employed on a temporary basis as a Casual Temporary/Seasonal employee.\n\nHow much will I work?\n\nIndividual schedules may vary depending on the combination of itineraries assigned, language skills, personal interests, experience, performance history and seniority. As you grow with Adventures by Disney™, additional work could come your way in the form of more trips, administrative tasks or facilitating presentations.\n\nIs there opportunity for more work?\n\nAs a growing company, we are always looking to harness our resources. As you grow with Adventures by Disney™, additional work could come your way in the form of more trips, administrative tasks or facilitating presentations.\n\nDo I have to live where I am going to be guiding trips?\n\nNo. Generally, our Adventure Guides will reside throughout the United States and will be transported to the starting point of their trip departure prior to each adventure.\n\nDo I get to go home in between trips?\n\nIf you live in the area where you are guiding, you are free to return home in between trips when you are off duty. If this is not the case, a \"schedule-by-schedule\" approach will be taken to determine if and for how long an Adventure Guide should stay in an area in between trips.\n\nWho will I be guiding with?\n\nAll adventures are led by two Adventure Guides. You may be partnered with a local expert, travel industry professional or someone who comes from within Disney and splits their time being an Adventure Guide and whatever their role might be within the Company. Adventure Guides come from diverse professional backgrounds; however, they all share the desire to deliver exceptional guest experiences and the ability to relate to every guest on a personal level.",

I felt off about it so I closed the websites. The emails that followed were from 3 or 4 different sites so I unsubscribed.   \nToday at around 8 am I got a phone call that said it was from my state, but the man on the call said he calling from somewhere else.

Partners pays most of its people the bare minimum, because most people who take the job want the benefits.\n\nThat said, a WELL WRITTEN resume that will pass the scrub test will get you farther than any amount of actual experience. All resumes are processed by computer first, and then a small (maybe 1-3%) amount are sent to a person in recruiting for secondary review and interviews. \n\nYou have to have a *stellar* resume if you want anything beyond part-time parks work.\n\n### Comment ID i2zkdi0 with +2 score by [(xoa25, Reddit, 2022-04-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/6cwncy/how_hard_is_it_to_get_a_job_working_for_disney_in/i2zkdi0/) (in reply to ID dhy45h2):\nDo you mind recommending and/or sharing examples of what a \"stellar\" resume is?  \nHow does the scrub test work and what do they look for in the scrub test?\n\n## Comment ID dhyddkr with +21 score by [(purplejackets, Reddit, 2017-05-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/6cwncy/how_hard_is_it_to_get_a_job_working_for_disney_in/dhyddkr/) (in reply to ID 6cwncy):\nIt's actually pretty hard if you're going for a \"professional\" job (working corporate, oppose to Disney shops and park rides). \n\nFor a reference, I have a master's degree with 2 years experience.

I did try searching the Disney Career website, but was unable to find anything. (I also experienced a lot of 'page not found' errors which was a little bit sad)\n\nI suppose it doesn't help that I'm not sure which category it would be in - media? Entertainment? Technology? Creative? (The categories are what generally gave me \"page not found\" errors.)\n\nI'm well past college, so the College program is not really a solution for me.

There is a wait list. Everyone wants photopass because it is considered a skill and you get paid more (not much though). You go through a pointless interview and then wait for your name to come up on the list. \nYou have to have ABSOLUTELY ZERO photographer experience. You go through the basic disney training, but then a week of photopass training. Your first 2-3 days are not even in a park, but rather a classroom learning the basics. They start off extremely slow - like how to attach the neck harness. Then you move on to the parks. Once you are in the parks, they audit everyone and make sure your composition and everything is up to par. But they teach you everything they want you to know and the shots they want you to take. You have to go through specialized training for characters, BBB, Pirate's League, roving etc. \nHope that helps!\n\n### Comment ID cbbuwq2 with +1 score by [(kecchin, Reddit, 2013-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/1j75t6/park_jobs_photopass/cbbuwq2/) (in reply to ID cbbtjvi):\nThat -does- help.

I know several people who have done it. I knew a few that had experience in photography and some that did not. Truth be told, disney would prefer you not to have a photography background. All they carry around is a tripod, camera (one lens), and a device that has a barcode scanner for the photopass cards. \n\nDisney, honestly wants to train the cast members how to do everything and do everything exact, no flair, no lenses, no diffusers. They want everyone to get a consistent photo experience. They want the same 20 shots throughout the park. They want to see no difference in photography from one cast member to the other. Really all the photopass cast member is for is to press the button and to make sure everyone fits in the shot. The pay is like of any other cast member (just a little above minimum wage). \n\nOne last thing, i am not sure if a wedding photographer gets any more money at the WDW resort that does weddings. DL does weddings too, but not as many and not as many packages as WDW has. \n\nTip: if you are a talented photographer, go into weddings. Good money can be made once you have good word of mouth. I know a few that make 1500-2500 a wedding and they do a wedding most weekends. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\n### Comment ID cbbuw8i with +1 score by [(kecchin, Reddit, 2013-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/1j75t6/park_jobs_photopass/cbbuw8i/) (in reply to ID cbburw9):\nPlease don't hate doing this, this is the type of answer I was looking for.

It's something I'd like to think about sometime (hence, in some ways, the interest in photopass), but generally I have been doing scenery/landscape - and I have been told that in general I have a [good eye](http://osakaeye.blogspot.jp/) for composition. \n\nLong story short, I have been living in Japan teaching for five years, and now that I feel like I'm done here, I'm trying to find something I would actually -enjoy- back in the US. I like teaching actually - but I'm not even close to certified, and I really can't afford to re-do undergrad in order to be certified. So I started thinking about other hobbies and interests I have.

Remember get a full time job at disney from the beginning. Although disney does not pay well, it is awful when they not only dont pay well, they dont give you any hours either during off season.\n\nSecond, there are wages posted on the website. I would say take any type of job whether it be attractions, photopass, custodial and take the wage multiply by 3.2/3 for a month (taxes) and then see what it comes out to be. Then look at the housing and see if you can afford any housing and/or food. Most the time... not... you will need several room mates. DO THIS BEFORE MAKING THE PLUNGE! I cannot tell you how many people i worked with who could not afford basic necessities. One of my friends live 4-5 sometimes to a 2 bedroom. Could barely afford food and still drove his car without insurance and several tickets (i believe he even had a warrant out for all the tickets). Bottom line, he could not afford it. He loved it, but my love for the mouse only goes so deep. \n\nIf i were you and i wanted to get a job somewhere attempt to find a job with **tips**. You have teaching experience try to get a tutoring job, or a linguist job somewhere. I promise you, although you are not working for the mouse if you did and cannot survive it would be worse. \n\nIf you really after all that want to work for the mouse. Try to get a job in hotels (it pays higher). Or try to get a job higher up, Celebration if you want florida, Burbank if you want california. Those jobs will give you a salary that is at least manageable to live off of. \n\nAny questions, i would love to help you answer. \n\nBy the way, your pictures are very nice.\n\n## Comment ID cbbrxr0 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2013-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/1j75t6/park_jobs_photopass/cbbrxr0/) (in reply to ID 1j75t6):\nI didn't see anything on the Disney careers for photo pass.

It's preferred that you have some background of how to use a camera but not necessary as they teach you everything. They really are looking for passion. Show you have a passion for Disney and a passion for photography and you should be fine. If for some reason they don't think you have what it takes for photography, they'll probably give you an opportunity to have a different position and tell you what to improve for to get photo pass. \nAs far as gear, they really just use standard settings. They use one flash, one lens, and they are required to keep their ISO, F-stop, and shutter speed settings to a certain setting.",

And we can have leia and Han too. It's animated so no need to worry about live action recasting.\n\nThere is so much lore and a bunch of Disney comics they could adapt. Luke and Ben training along with going on adventures. The other padawans as side characters. Or maybe full fledged character development for some of them into supporting main cast.\n\nAnd by like season 3, we could get snoke infiltrating Ben's mind and all that. Also the guy Ren who was the leader of the knights before Kylo. His influence on Ben. And the confrontation he had with Luke and Ben. Could even be a side plot of Snoke building up the first order.\n\nShow ends with the destruction of the temple. Or maybe a final season focusing on Snoke and Ben's initial training. And Leia and Han dealing with the direct aftermath of Ben falling to the dark side.\nIf done right this could easily be a 10/10 show.\n\n#### Comment ID ld0od7o with +1 score by [(NumeralJoker, Reddit, 2024-07-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1e039kz/a_new_star_wars_animated_tv_show_seems_to_be_in/ld0od7o/) (in reply to ID lcm2xyw):\nYeah, the potential a show like this has is massive, even with the sequel controversies.\n\nDo something to establish Luke's legend. Show us his peak power. Show us how he kept the peace durint the ABY20s era. Show him and Ben heroically saving worlds and keeping the Galaxy a more stable, better place for a few years, even if some of it falls apart later.\n\nYou can always have the impact of what they did show up in post sequel content too. You can set up plot threads in the show that extend beyond episode IX to make Luke's impact even more relevant, reducing a little bit of the resentment some fans would have of him being \"passed over\" so to speak. It also makes the fall of his temple more tragic, and could plant threads that Rey would pick up on later when rebuilding the order (again) herself.\n\nIMHO, a Jedi centric show set from 23ABY-28ABY would fill in the gap nicely, take place after the Mando era, and finally be the bridge we needed for all 3 trilogies to start to work better as a saga. It would reinvigorate interest in the franchise from older fans and bypass some of the sequel hate by giving people who were disappointed by Episode VIII more of what they'd hoped to see, but in a less shallow, better fleshed out way. It allows for great creativity by focusing on enemies who are not the Sith or even the First Order (most of the time), yet still could be new, great threats in their own right. It justifies more of Luke's \"legend\" status that he's so cynical about by Episode VIII, and you could see additional reasons why he may have emotional struggles that go beyond just the fall of Ben. Plant the seeds of doubt and fear in him just a little bit.\n\n### Comment ID lckygjv with +4 score by [(darthsheldoninkwizy, Reddit, 2024-07-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1e039kz/a_new_star_wars_animated_tv_show_seems_to_be_in/lckygjv/) (in reply to ID lck16ya):\nMaybe Shadow of Sith adaptation, that would be cool.\n\n### Comment ID lckn5hr with +7 score by [(Maldovar, Reddit, 2024-07-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1e039kz/a_new_star_wars_animated_tv_show_seems_to_be_in/lckn5hr/) (in reply to ID lck16ya):\nYou'll get more clones and you'll like it\n\n#### Comment ID lckt9jg with +7 score by [(Nonsuch42, Reddit, 2024-07-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1e039kz/a_new_star_wars_animated_tv_show_seems_to_be_in/lckt9jg/) (in reply to ID lckn5hr):\nNoooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n\n#### Comment ID ld4ulfu with +1 score by [(ObliWobliKenobli, Reddit, 2024-07-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1e039kz/a_new_star_wars_animated_tv_show_seems_to_be_in/ld4ulfu/) (in reply to ID lckn5hr):\nYes please thank you very much.\n\n### Comment ID lckd3hz with +7 score by [(Pixgamer11, Reddit, 2024-07-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1e039kz/a_new_star_wars_animated_tv_show_seems_to_be_in/lckd3hz/) (in reply to ID lck16ya):\nPlease No more Prequels to the trilogies Just do Something far back or in the far Future nothing We.have in Disney Canon right now\n\n#### Comment ID lckq380 with +16 score by [(CurseofLono88, Reddit, 2024-07-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1e039kz/a_new_star_wars_animated_tv_show_seems_to_be_in/lckq380/) (in reply to ID lckd3hz):\nAre you telling me you wouldn’t watch a show about Bor Gullet escaping Jeddah just in the nick of time and then flying through the galaxy, meeting friends and foes, knowing the truth but no longer a soldier in Saw Gerrera’s war.

Not a full series. The timeline is way too restrictive. Awesome stuff with great future potential can't really exist, and we've got more than enough Jedi alive during that time that it stretches how extinct we felt the Jedi were during the OT. Let that be a mini series or a book or a story arc in something ongoing (like a comic). We've got Cal, Omega, Grogu and other force sensitives setup for the future. We also don't need MORE Inquisitor content. A bunch of younglings and preteens trying to find The Path as they run from boring Inquisitors sounds boring. \n\n\nI disagree about OT trio (though eventually they should make it) and PT. Yet again more highly restrictive eras, characters and oversaturated eras. Not to mention get something just a bit wrong and you've got outcries and criticisms galore, x1000 if the characters are the OT trio. \n\n\nNo, instead, I say go Old Republic, New Republic (post EP 9) or High Republic. Honestly the High Republic seems overly restrictive as well, with what they can do with the Sith and dark side to be strictly limited.\n\n#### Comment ID lck61fj with +3 score by [(M3rc_Nate, Reddit, 2024-07-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1e039kz/a_new_star_wars_animated_tv_show_seems_to_be_in/lck61fj/) (in reply to ID lck5xej):\nBut, regardless of all that, I think what interests me a lot, which has been setup most recently, is adult Omega.

It's creating something of a problem since this isn't just a Disney thing. Millennial and Gen Z viewers are especially hungry for animation projects and the industry as a whole can't keep up. There is all this talk about AI streamlining the process, but we aren't seeing it happen yet and most people think it still won't be enough. They need to hire more people and offer better pay, but the industry is set up around low balling people.

As for Tokyo Disney, you either gotta be fluent and I mean FLUENT in Japanese with a good ass disney resume to be competitive with their work force, also I doubt they would fly you out and give accommodation unless you're in entertainment.

It could also just be that they haven't updated the system. If the position you applied to starts very soon or has already started, then it's likely that the info hasn't been updated yet and you haven't made it this time.

Tell him to use Rostr on the Hub to find people in positions that he wants to learn more about. I did this multiple times and they were always incredibly accommodating, kind, and willing to offer advice.\n  \nOne thing - the industry is incredibly cutthroat - my girlfriend and numerous friends held internships and actual positions in WDI, and so many of them individually said that it felt like their peers would sell them for recognition.\n\n### Comment ID jtxsuv0 with +43 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jtxsuv0/) (in reply to ID jtxs4i7):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID jtxu272 with +146 score by [(president_of_burundi, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jtxu272/) (in reply to ID jtxsuv0):\nThe -neering part of Imagineering is for 'engineering'.

But there are the resorts, new project build up, and a lot of other things that come into play before an engineer or architect even set foot on a project or things after they’re done that still have to be done.\n\nSpatial design, environmental design are also jobs that fall under imagineering.\n\nI do agree with possibly having to work elsewhere and coming back.  My cousin did the college program, left for another job, and then was asked personally by his former manager to come back to Disney.  He gained a lot of experience in his short year away as well.\n\nIt really depends on where within WID he’s interested in working, but he should absolutely start making it known he’d like to improve himself, he’s considering going back to school, and asking for advice.\n\nWID is highly competitive in terms of just hiring even though so it’s important to remember that.  And also remember that even if he’s not under the WID umbrella there are many other positions under the WDC umbrella that are not specifically at/with the parks.

This can be anything from Production Design, to Engineering, to Project Management, to sculpting. There are truly so many different roles/positions and potential backgrounds. \n\nThe key is taking your background/strengths and learning how to apply them to the themed entertainment industry. So it absolutely isn't just for engineers.\n\nBut let me ask - does he want JUST a job at imagineering? Or would he be happy working for other parks doing the same thing?\n\nThere are a few things to remember - the industry will favor industry work experience very highly. This is where starting from complete scratch is hardest - if you have little to no experience in entertainment arts, or on high-level projects it will be much harder to be an attractive candidate.\n\nThere are also very (very) few ways to get into the industry by chance. The best way is through an internship.\n\nWhat is your brother's undergrad in? What strengths does he bring to the table that would be attractive to WDI?

The thing to understand is that at its basic level, WDI is a design-build construction company.  They just happen to have a single client, and built really cool stuff.  \n  \nThere are jobs ranging from engineers, construction managers, to finance, to lighting, AV, graphic design, and production.  Getting in is tough, but not impossible, and it’s never too late!  It helps to know people as they get 1,000’s of applications for any opening, networking is key.

There is a “skunkworks-esque” R&D division that creates a lot of the effects, but like everything else, those plans get patented then contracted out.  Buena Vista Construction Co. is WDW’s Construction company is rarely used by WDI.  To your point, WDI primarily does the design, and then  robustly oversee’s the build.  With engineers constantly traveling all over the world to ensure quality when components are being manufactured.  \n  \nThe pro’s are very obvious, you get to help build rollercoasters, cruise ships, hotels, and affect the Disney Skyline.  I was in Finance but was in rooms driving discussions with literal Disney legends.  Leadership was incredible, very demanding, but you were working with the best so everyone was in on the mission.\n  \nThe cons were few, namely there were “chosen ones” who seemed to rise up quickly.  There was definitely a corporate game to play.  With that said, the reason for my departure was for a promotional opportunity within WDW Finance that I couldn’t pass up.

We want to do a Little Mermaid themed ride. Go brainstorm!\n\nor\n\nB. We are doing a Little Mermaid ride that is a 'constant queue' ride (like Haunted Mansion where the cars never stop moving and the ride can accommodate a LARGE number of guests quickly), that's going to sit in exactly This spot where the old submarine ride used to be. It needs to accommodate X guest per hour and require no more than X employees.  The ride should be a basic retelling of the Little Mermaid movie using the songs from the movie. Each section of the ride will be a scene from the movie, which we have broken down in to these X number of scenes. This scene will have such and such water feature. This scene will be black light. etc. There will be X number of animatronic figures in scene A,B,C, etc. Your budgetary constraints are XYZ. This ride will not leave ground level and the target demographic will be all ages, especially stroller age children and their families.\n\nI have a feeling a LOT of us dreamers want it to be A, but it's more B. How do you get a job being the idea person in option B that brings the ideas to WDI? Like the Toy Story ride is amazingly fun and not just a retelling of the movie. The themeing is impeccable, even in the queue with the oversized toys. How did that ride go from idea to existing? \n\nI left the field of Architecture early in my career because I learned quickly that clients usually brought in very specific ideas and my main function was to take their idea and make it real. I was allowed a little input, but not much. To be the 'mindblowing idea guy' as an Architect, like becoming the next Frank Lloyd Wright or something, you had to be more salesman than engineer; convincing the client your grand idea was better than their idea. I quickly learned I'm not a salesperson type personality, even though I had great ideas and a lot of artistic design talent and even enjoyed the process of taking general ideas to constructed reliable reality.\n\nAnd honestly, my personal experience and critique of the Little Mermaid ride is exactly how I describe it in B. Very dull. But hey, I'm not the target demographic. I'm an middle age fart that likes rollercoasters and thrill rides. Plus I'm not bitter at all for the loss of the Norway or Submarine rides, I promise! /s (ha ha). The challenges of taking someone else's idea and making it a reality does bring it's own thrill and enjoyment, but I don't think the general public thinks in these terms when they hear \"Imagineering\".

In concept roles, there are no programmatic limits to what you can dream up. If you’re more an engineer, graphic designer, architect, costumer, show set construction or painter, production etc. the exploration of the ride system, concept, etc. might be pretty well defined by the time you are participating.\n\nBut for a ride like Toy Story, there might be 3, 8, 20 however many ideas dreamed up by the concept people, all different ride systems explored, new things tried out - until the practicality of execution sets in and the ideas are narrowed down to one that can be built.\n\nIncidentally this process is just really the creative process you would find at a branding agency, in television or film, advertising, software development and more - just on an enormous scale with an emphasis on nothing being impossible for the creative idea early on. Once you learn how to do this in the Disney context it’s applicable to every creative industry and you can be the star of their problem-solving.\n\n#### Comment ID ju0dnfl with +5 score by [(vtfb79, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/ju0dnfl/) (in reply to ID jtz82xm):\nThere’s also a lot of data that gets analyzed.  What rides are starting to be ignored, what restaurants and shops are underperforming, what facilities have hit the end of their useful life? As u/gnuoyedonig mentioned, it’s like a branding agency’s creative process and there’s about 20 ideas to every location on property at a variety of scales.  Have had the opportunity to participate in some of the brainstorming/creative workshops when they’re idea gathering.  That process is worthy of a Masterclass.  \n  \nThe sad thing though is when a project starts going though the “Gating” process (Blue Sky idea to approved project with a budget) is seeing what gets left behind.  I was I able to see the original concepts for Guardians, Ratatouille, and Mickey’s Runaway Rail.  While the final product is great, so many cool (and expensive) ideas were cut out.

Is it possible? Absolutely. If we're being realistic though? It's going to be a tough sell.\n\nFirst of all in order to get any sort of job in the industry, let alone at WDI, you'll have to be VERY self-driven and self-motivated - your brother should be the one driving these conversations. These aren't jobs you just stumble into - it takes people sometimes decades to break into the industry after non-stop work and dedication. These people are often experts and extremely talented in one specific area, and highly talented in multiple others.\n\nThe chances of him jumping into a role at WDI are very \\very\\ low. Impossible? Absolutely not, but it's exceedingly low.\n\nUnless your brother has a secret hidden card, or an obscure talent which is in high-demand he will at the very least need to go back to school and help define his skill-set. From there his best bet would be to apply to internships with WDI, but even then they are extremely and wildly competitive, and do not guarantee a future. \n\nThe problem is your brother's best bet at getting a job in WDI is by NOT getting a job with WDI and working elsewhere at any number of vendors/design firms until he breaks in. So does your brother want to work in the industry, or just WDI?\n\nIf he just wants a future with WDI then the venture is almost certainly not worth it - you'd be putting so much on the line for such a low chance. I encounter people like this constantly - they spend years trying to break into the industry, but only want to work at WDI/UC, and when they get a job at neither, they end up miserable and unhappy.\n\nMeanwhile the people who are open to working at other vendors and design firms and play the long-game, that truly love the industry and work, they are happy, and many-times they end up in places like WDI and UC.\n\nYou have to love the INDUSTRY, not just the company.\n\n\\He knows A LOT about Disney's history and has had a lot of jobs within hospitality.\n\nThis sounds like he'd do great as a tour guide, or as others have suggested a \"Plaid\" at Guest Services. What good is the park the Imagineers dream up and build if the talent to make it come to life isn't there?\n\nThe front-line workers are essential to maintaining the magic. Perhaps that is where he will fit into the picture best?\n\nAs an industry professional - my best advice is that HE needs to not only sit down and understand what WDI does, but where he sees himself clearly fitting into that picture. It can't be \"the ideas guy\" - it has to be a skilled professional path that can be practically applied to the work being done. From there he would best be served by pursuing this academically and leveraging that from there. \n\nMy most truthful advice to him though is to explore all of the in-park jobs and positions that Disney offers. There are plenty of non-WDI positions which have significant bearing on the park, it's future, and the overall experience. All of these will be tough to get into, but will be MUCH easier than WDI. He can also check out the sub-divisions of the parks like Disney Live Entertainment, the holiday events team, guest services, and senior park operations.\n\nIf he is truly interested in the Themed Entertainment industry as a whole and would be happy working anywhere, and not just WDI, then I say that is when you start exploring the steps to breaking into the industry. \n\nWithout knowing what your brother is good at, and what he enjoys and is skilled at - it will be extremely hard to give any sort of advice. There might be only a handful of positions, but there are a thousand and one ways to get started into getting into WDI - each one with different advice and requirements. Once he figures that out, and can see himself happy dedicating everything to that for years to come, then it’s time to talk things like education, and industry related events (TEA Mixers, IAAPA, etc..,) But again - he has to love the industry, and not just WDI.\n\nAnd I do have to ask, after 5-8 years, what if he is no closer to realizing the dream of becoming an imagineer? Will he be happy and grateful for the journey? Or will he feel like he wasted time and made a mistake?\n\n### Comment ID jtzrn4g with +6 score by [(retlaw_yensid, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jtzrn4g/) (in reply to ID jtyhc98):\nFellow mouse in the industry here, this guys response is it exactly.

Going to back school is a good first step.\n\nI work in “big tech” and work with several former Imagineers.

This is a job that, as someone else said,’is incredibly cut throat. They take people who are excellent at what they do, not just someone who has the right degree. Additionally so many of these positions are filled via referrals and relationships. Without confidence to build relationships and coincidence in himself being hired for anything is going to be a struggle. It’s not impossible. It’s just another piece of the overall puzzle. He’s going to be competing against people with the education, the relationships, and who have had internships or real-life related experience. That said, a customer service job would be a good fit if he can be confident and come out of his shell with strangers. Working some time in that, paying attention to how to use his position to make special moments, engage guests, etc will be great work experience.\n\n## Comment ID jtyget2 with +12 score by [(HopefulMeaning777, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jtyget2/) (in reply to ID 15crb7m):\nYou sound like a really good sister.

These roles definitely focus more on guest service than the roles within Imagineering do, and with so many hotels, there is greater need for people who have background knowledge of Disney and how things run. I would encourage him to look for people in similar roles on Rostr and who their direct reports are to understand what jobs might be stepping stones to those kinds of positions.\n\n## Comment ID jty18sm with +8 score by [(BroadwayCatDad, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jty18sm/) (in reply to ID 15crb7m):\nStart somewhere else…Garner Holt, Universal, Sally.

I'm a writer, with no engineering or design skills, but my aspiration is to become a creative director.\n\n- there are also hundreds of other companies within the 'themed entertainment' sector alongside Disney, often being employed by the likes of Disney and Universal as subcontractors and consultants, so it's more realistic that he'll start working for those types of companies, and gain broad experience in a number of different roles there.\n\n- and as an additional note from personal experience, he should check out the NextGen Showcase for an opportunity to get some hands on experience!\n\nDrop me a message if it would be useful to chat more.\n\n### Comment ID jtzrw4k with +2 score by [(retlaw_yensid, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jtzrw4k/) (in reply to ID jtyi3lq):\n+1 to NextGen showcase.

Only a tiny portion of those have the capability to fit in at Imagineering and contribute something new to the company.\n\nWhen I was at Imagineering I had a front row seat for the hiring process both for my department and the larger division we were in. The Directors and managers were absolutely savage with those resumes - I’ve never seen resumes ridiculed in an organization so openly. It was bitter and ugly. That doesn’t mean they were horrible people to work with - I think it just comes from long hours of resume review that had to occur constantly if your department was hiring. And the ridiculousness of the ask on the part of the applicant.\n\nI did my share of resume review and there were so many where the person had no related experience doing the kind of creative work related to the position they were applying for, but in their cover letter they expressed how working for Imagineering was a dream they had since their first park visit, or how they built a model of a ride that pretty much was one of the existing rides with the storyline from a different Disney movie applied. These get old fast - and it’s next to impossible to see how that person would end up contributing anything new to the company.\n\nDisney doesn’t want to hire people who imagine themselves building things similar to what already exists, they want people who can create brand-new things, never before seen. Really innovative ideas.\n\nThere was almost a trap for people who loved what Disney already was, and I saw lots of these people stagnate in their roles and not move forward.  People who acted ambivalent about Disney history raced ahead. One guy who showed actual contempt for the parks became an executive level creative, and maybe it was because he was not so in love with things he could bring a new perspective.\n\n## Comment ID jty56z0 with +11 score by [(Colt_kun, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jty56z0/) (in reply to ID 15crb7m):\nImagineers are a highly sought after position and cover a lot of fields - architecture design, interior design, costuming and textile work, artists, storytellers, engineering, and others I can't think of right now. Today's imagineers usually (but not always) require advanced degrees and impressive portfolios. But it's not impossible, just a long road.\n\nOne imagineer I got to speak to during the build of New Fantasyland said he started by volunteering at a community theater and building stage props! So there's loads of roads. Just have to go back to school in the field he wants and find applicable ways to get it on his resume. Document everything for his portfolio. And as others have said, getting some Disney work on there will help.\n\nHe may want to start by digging out some of the Disney books on attractions - Haunted Mansion and pirates are two I read - to see what went into building them. There's some cool behind the scenes documentaries out there too. Just so he can get an idea of what all encompasses the Imagineering role.\n\nGood luck to him!\n\n## Comment ID jtxp57g with +9 score by [(strawbabies, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jtxp57g/) (in reply to ID 15crb7m):\nhttps://themeparkarchitect.com/how-to-become-a-disney-imagineer/\n\n## Comment ID jtyhd5c with +3 score by [(doctrsnoop, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/jtyhd5c/) (in reply to ID 15crb7m):\nI know for a fact that even fully qualified people are very unlikely to get there.

But Getting job skills and confidence is a great thing.   anything more is gravy.  Also , the track to imagineer doesn't have to involve working for Disney the whole time.\n\nThere are many paths to take, most are reasonably valid.

Pick a field that he will be interested in for the rest of his life. Something he could do for a career even if it wasn’t at Disney.\n\n2. Go to college for a degree specifically in that field. Batchelor’s at the very least. WDI likes experienced specialists.\n\n3. While in college, he can take advantage of the [ImagiNations](https://disneyimaginations.com) competition and internships IN HIS FIELD ONLY at Disney or other companies. I’d promote other companies at this stage above Disney depending on the field, because he will learn more and having other companies looks far better on your resume than having only Disney. They are a solid F company for the field I was in and a lot of my colleagues left for other, higher caliber, companies. He will need experience when he comes to WDI.\n\n4. Graduate and get hired. I would really suggest going to other companies after graduation to learn how to actually do the job in his field since, as I hinted at before, Disney isn’t the best place to learn that. I noticed a DRASTIC difference between those who graduated and went straight to Disney and those who graduated and went to a better company and then went to Disney. Those that went straight to Disney had no idea how to get things done. It was sad to see. Honestly, I felt bad for them because they would really struggle if Disney laid them off or they wanted to apply to somewhere else.\nApply for roles related to his field at [jobs.disneycareers.com](https://jobs.disneycareers.com) or apply to other companies. Getting hired immediately after graduation is critical. The most important thing at this point is getting QUALITY experience as quickly as possible.\n\n5. If he’s dead set on Disney, reach out to recruiters on LinkedIn and they should be able to hone down to the specific recruiter for the role and his field in general to help with other open positions.\n\nA word of warning. The old days of WDI are LOOONG gone. You can search for posts from ex-WDI CM’s on LinkedIn for a more detailed perspective about that. Don’t let your dreams and the propaganda WDI documentaries crush the reality of what working for WDI actually is these days. There’s also a TON of other fantastic, and imo better, companies to work for in the Themed Entertainment Industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID ju8tpnh with +1 score by [(Steve_Supremo, Reddit, 2023-07-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15crb7m/how_to_become_a_disney_imagineer_when_youre_30/ju8tpnh/) (in reply to ID 15crb7m):\nWork and career aside… if HE doesn’t believe it’s possible, there isn’t enough planning in the world that will help him.

Once he sees he does have the ability to do “X”, level him up to something a little more difficult. Eventually that may help his own belief system. \n\nI just hate to see you do all this work for him to say, “I can’t”. That mentality will get him no further than he is today.
