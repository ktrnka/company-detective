The emails that followed were from 3 or 4 different sites so I unsubscribed.   \nToday at around 8 am I got a phone call that said it was from my state, but the man on the call said he calling from somewhere else.

He said the recruiter would be in touch with next steps.\n\n2/11/22 - talent acquisition coordinator reached out to schedule two follow-up interviews.\n\n2/16/22 - had my 2nd interview with a tangential team member. again, an informal conversation where they got to know me, my interest in the role, and problem solving skills. they said the recruiter would be in touch with next steps.\n\n2/17/22 - had my 3rd interview with another tangential team member. informal conversation - they reviewed Disney's mission statement and employee values (from the website) and discussed their career path within the company. they said the recruiter would be in touch with next steps.\n\n2/25/22 - 4/24/22: I'd been emailing my recruiter periodically for status updates and received no response whatsoever. after a few weeks, my recruiter seemed to have switched roles - therefore, there was no direction on who to contact or what any next steps may be. my status on the job portal was still pending as a candidate.\n\n4/25/22 - the job req was reassigned to a new recruiter, who then reached out to connect with me and see if I was still interested in the role. he reviewed the job description and wanted to schedule a few follow-up calls, since my interviews were almost 2.5 months prior. \n\n5/10/22 - had a follow-up interview with the hiring manager. he explained how his team had made a few modifications on the role and wanted to review the updates. an informal discussion where we were able to touch base and how each of us felt about the role.\n\n5/16/22 - the recruiter reached out with an update; said that they wanted to schedule a final interview with a VP of the department. \n\n5/19/22 - had an interview with a VP of the department. he wanted to know more about my background and vision for the role, see how my professional goals aligned with the goals for the job, and provide perspective on macro business priorities. it was a casual conversation that lasted about 25 minutes. \n\n5/25/22 - received a job offer via phone!! the recruiter explained salary/benefits/perks/etc and then followd up with an official offer via email.\n\n## Comment ID ia0xs8a with +15 score by [(oliviamrow, Reddit, 2022-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/uxwzbd/interviewing_with_disney_a_timeline/ia0xs8a/) (in reply to ID uxwzbd):\nCongratulations!\n\nThat's long, but for what it's worth / for anyone reading this who's curious, it's not much longer than my experience in the past with two decently well known media companies- changes to the role slowed things down for you, but even just busy stretches in the department that needs to fill the position can also do that, especially if they're trying to backfill for someone who left and are therefore short handed.\n\nBest of luck to you in the new job, OP, assuming you're accepting :)\n\n## Comment ID ia1aaov with +5 score by [(Bearjupiter, Reddit, 2022-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/uxwzbd/interviewing_with_disney_a_timeline/ia1aaov/) (in reply to ID uxwzbd):\nCongrats on the role!

They have numerous animal sciences internships and even horticultural internships as well. Like I said I’m no bio major so I don’t exactly know what would be 100% related to your major, but there’s a bunch of offerings for professional internships! Doing the DCP is sometimes required for getting into those internships, but doing the DCP lets you network and build relationships with those teams at special networking events so you’d have a better shot at it. \n\nthe DCP may not help your career exactly, but it could lead to possibilities to getting internships that could help your future career plans. Here’s the link for the professional internships that are with the animal programs/conversation! Some do require either previous internships with animal programs at other places or doing a college program. \n\nhttps://jobs.disneycareers.com/search-jobs?k=animal&alp=&alt=&r=&kt=1&ascf=[{%22key%22:%22is_manager%22,%22value%22:%22Professional%20Internship%22}]\n\nIf you could take some online classes and not get too far behind in your track you could open the possibility to doing internships with Disney that actually relate to your major.

I am also a bio major. While nothing I did related directly to my major it is still a huge resume booster. You are working in a very high stress situation. Everyone knows the Disney name and a decent amount of people understand what comes along with that name. It is a very respectable job position. You will learn a lot of skills with interacting with people from all around the world which is valuable in any situation! Plus like another person on this thread said, they have a lot of PI that do relate and the DCP opens the doors for them. Some of those PI are alumni only.\n\n### Comment ID f0lu7yd with +1 score by [(mckaughly, Reddit, 2019-09-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneycollegeprogram/comments/d597h1/wildlife_biology_majors/f0lu7yd/) (in reply to ID f0lrgt1):\nThank you so much!

I had aspirations of being either a tech architect for the parks and resorts division of the company, or a project manager. Not anymore.\n\nCOVID was a bit more understandable. But hopefully they have a plan to hire CMs back soon.

I had days where I came home glowing from the magic and days where I came home and cried because it was so tough. My first program I wanted to quit for a good two months but I stuck it out. Of course looking back I remember the good parts. It’s kinda like when a woman gives birth she forgets all the pain when she holds her baby, lol. \n\nYou apply online.

The CEP application process takes about 5 months from the time you apply to the time you are accepted, then another 3 months before you actually move down there.\n\nIt was pretty life changing for good and bad. My previous employment background was far above the tasks required of my job in WDW so I found it really easy and excelled at it. I spent a good portion of my shift interacting with guests so my people skills and communication got way better.\n\nThe best part though were my program housing roommates. I now say I have 5 extra brothers and a sister, we are quite close and I go out to visit them on the east coast once a year!\n\nThe biggest downside to it was having to come home. For a lot of international college program participants this is one of the only times they’ll go to WDW so having to leave is difficult and the post program depression is real.

To the point that for the last two years, I've been strongly trying to get a job in the Orlando area, or at Disney World itself. I've become quite adept at the latest WDW news, and every minuscule change that occurs by the park, and I am fascinated by any updates on the park.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question: I'm a writer, and ideally, I would love to find a job in the Orlando area where I could utilize my Disney-addled brain and writing skills.

Both times it took several months before they got back to me. The time I did get it, it took 4 months from application to acceptance. And I believe that happened because someone else had beat me to the position but then wasn't able to accept it due to visa issues, so they had to sort that out, and then contact me as the runner up. Stuff like that happens all the time and it takes a while for them to work through the applicants. \n\nBut again, I would ask a recruiter personally. It could also just be that they haven't updated the system. If the position you applied to starts very soon or has already started, then it's likely that the info hasn't been updated yet and you haven't made it this time. But if it's still a while aways, then it's possible they're still working through applicants/accepted people until the position is definitively filled before they send out official rejections.\n\n## Comment ID hc7oq5q with +2 score by [(colorstoobright, Reddit, 2021-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/pkwmmw/disney_application_process_question/hc7oq5q/) (in reply to ID pkwmmw):\nI’ve interviewed at Disney for a non-Animation related job. They do take forever sometimes to reply, and that’s even before Covid. Be patient and apply to other jobs, don’t put all your eggs in this basket.\n\nGood luck!\n\n## Comment ID hc7bu28 with +1 score by [(EfficientGuarantee49, Reddit, 2021-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/pkwmmw/disney_application_process_question/hc7bu28/) (in reply to ID pkwmmw):\nTry not to stay focused on just applying online. If you can, go in and make yourself known that your interested in a position. It kind of gives a face to the application.\n\n## Comment ID hce0lz1 with +1 score by [(what1226, Reddit, 2021-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/pkwmmw/disney_application_process_question/hce0lz1/) (in reply to ID pkwmmw):\nFirst time I applied to Disney animation it was three months until my status changed to a rejection.  Second time it took a month until it changed to an \"under consideration\".\n\nApplying to Disney you just got to send and forget.  They take forever as I am learning.  \n\nIf your still interested in Disney, they are starting to post actual job opportunities for their new Vancouver studio (animation positions have no been posted yet).\n\n## Comment ID hi6p5m6 with +1 score by [(rhythm_lick, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/pkwmmw/disney_application_process_question/hi6p5m6/) (in reply to ID pkwmmw):\nI applied to the layout trainee on the 17th, and it went from \"under review\" to \"in consideration\" the next day. So I guess there really is no set time when it happens. I'm in the same boat where I'm just wait to find out if I'll get am interview or not. Lowkey freaking out over it haha"

There is no need to offer a service when the person that is providing it is not able to offer it to the best of their ability. Especially when the guests we are dealing with have it in their minds that we are there to make their day 'magical' at whatever cost. This entire branding needs to change since it is becoming root to employees that do not care about you (upper management and company as a whole) because you do not care about them.",

There are many locations in the park that we are stationed that do not have shade and we are not given realistic rest areas or opportunities onstage to rest. So on days where we are met with high heat and we are short staffed we are still expected to go out and 'make magic'. Fellow Cast Members definitely try to help but overall the operation is more important. \nThe times that they don't really work with my schedule is when they schedule me for a shift when the shift end time is 30 or 15 minutes before my class. \nOn that note the attendance policy is also ridiculous. We are practically forced to park outside resort property and walk or take a shuttle to our work bases then clock in. This means if your shift start time is 8:30am then you actually should be at the parking structure by 8. Some would even say 7:45am since if there is anything happening around the park (emergency services or Disney Resort events) we are still expected to be at our bases at shift time regardless. This may not sound horrible but over time it will eat away at you that you have an unpaid responsibility to account for the resort's inability to establish an efficient fair clock in/out system.",

The work often requires balancing the magical essence of Disney's beloved characters and narratives with fresh, modern design approaches. As a designer, you work closely with cross-functional teams, including illustrators, animators, and marketing strategists, to ensure the visual elements align with the broader vision of each project.",

So on days where we are met with high heat and we are short staffed we are still expected to go out and 'make magic'. Fellow Cast Members definitely try to help but overall the operation is more important. \nThe times that they don't really work with my schedule is when they schedule me for a shift when the shift end time is 30 or 15 minutes before my class. \nOn that note the attendance policy is also ridiculous. We are practically forced to park outside resort property and walk or take a shuttle to our work bases then clock in. This means if your shift start time is 8:30am then you actually should be at the parking structure by 8. Some would even say 7:45am since if there is anything happening around the park (emergency services or Disney Resort events) we are still expected to be at our bases at shift time regardless. This may not sound horrible but over time it will eat away at you that you have an unpaid responsibility to account for the resort's inability to establish an efficient fair clock in/out system.",

Which more than I can say for other departments at the resort. They have worked with my school schedule pretty well, i'd say 8/10 times. Almost everyone is helpful and nice and you can meet some pretty amazing people. On a good day I leave fulfilled, as much as a job where you capture memories of people cherishing moments will leave you. \nOn top of that it pays really well.",
