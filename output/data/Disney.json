  "summary_markdown": "# About Disney\n\nThe Walt Disney Company, commonly known as Disney, was founded in 1923 and is headquartered in Burbank, California. It is a leading multinational entertainment and media conglomerate, operating through various segments such as Media Networks, Parks, Experiences and Products, Studio Entertainment, and Direct-to-Consumer & International. As of 2024, Disney employs approximately 223,000 people worldwide, making it one of the largest employers in the entertainment industry [(Variety, 2024-10-02)](https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/disney-layoffs-75-staffers-abc-news-stations-1236165850/).\n\nDisney generates revenue through a diverse range of products and services, including television networks, theme parks, film studios, and streaming services. The company primarily operates in the B2C (business-to-consumer) space, catering to a global audience with its entertainment offerings. Disney's products are distributed through various channels, including direct sales at theme parks, digital platforms like Disney+, and traditional media outlets.\n\nOver the years, Disney has evolved from a small animation studio into a global entertainment powerhouse. The company is known for its iconic characters, theme parks, and a vast library of films and television shows. Third parties often describe Disney as a leader in family entertainment, while the company itself emphasizes its commitment to creating magical experiences for its audience.\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nKathleen Kennedy is a notable executive at Disney, serving as the president of Lucasfilm since its acquisition by Disney in 2012. She has played a significant role in the expansion of the Star Wars franchise into both film and television. Despite facing criticism from fans, Kennedy has been instrumental in shaping the creative direction of the franchise [(Hollywood Reporter, 2024-10-03)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/star-wars-disney-analysis-ratings-box-office-1236011620/).\n\n# News\n\n## Financial Performance and Layoffs\n\nDisney has been undergoing significant restructuring to address financial challenges. This includes layoffs affecting around 75 staffers at ABC News and local stations, as part of broader cost-cutting measures across the company. This follows a trend of job reductions, with about 300 jobs cut in various corporate departments in late September 2024. The company is adapting to a rapidly changing media landscape, where traditional TV viewership is declining in favor of streaming services [(Variety, 2024-10-02)](https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/disney-layoffs-75-staffers-abc-news-stations-1236165850/).\n\n## Partnerships and Agreements\n\nIn September 2024, Disney reached a new agreement with DirecTV, restoring access to Disney's channels, including ESPN and ABC, after a dispute over carriage fees. This agreement allows DirecTV customers to include Disney's streaming services in select packages, reflecting a shift towards more flexible subscription options [(CBS News, 2024-09-14)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/directv-disney-agreement-channels-restored/).\n\n## Disney Parks and Experiences\n\nDisney's theme parks, particularly Walt Disney World in Florida, continue to be a major draw for tourists. Recent weather events, including Hurricane Milton, have led to temporary closures of certain resorts and attractions. Disney has implemented flexible cancellation policies for guests affected by the storm, demonstrating a commitment to customer service during emergencies [(AllEars, 2024-10-07)](https://allears.net/2024/10/07/is-disney-world-closing-for-hurricane-milton/).\n\n### New Developments in Parks\n\nDisney has recently introduced new merchandise lines and themed experiences at its parks. For instance, a new merchandise line specific to Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa was launched, showcasing the company's focus on enhancing guest experiences through unique offerings [(WDW News Today, 2023-12-20)](https://wdwnt.com/).\n\n## Disney's Streaming Services\n\nDisney+ has been a significant focus for the company, with recent announcements about new features such as continuous playlists aimed at enhancing user experience. This move is part of Disney's strategy to retain subscribers amid a competitive streaming landscape, where Disney+ subscriptions peaked at 164 million in late 2022 but have since declined to around 153 million [(Hollywood Reporter, 2024-10-03)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/star-wars-disney-analysis-ratings-box-office-1236011620/).\n\n### Content Strategy\n\nDisney has shifted its content strategy towards streaming, with a focus on original programming. The success of shows like \"The Mandalorian\" has been pivotal, although recent series such as \"The Acolyte\" have faced mixed reviews and lower viewership, prompting questions about the future direction of the Star Wars franchise [(Hollywood Reporter, 2024-10-03)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/star-wars-disney-analysis-ratings-box-office-1236011620/).\n\n# Additional Reading\n\n- [Employee and Cast Member Benefits](https://jobs.disneycareers.com/benefits)\n- [Castaway Jobs and Careers at Disney Cruise Line](https://jobs.disneycareers.com/island)\n- [Search Jobs and Careers at ESPN](https://jobs.disneycareers.com/espn)\n- [Disney International Program jobs](https://jobs.disneycareers.com/search-jobs?acm=ALL&alrpm=ALL&ascf=%5B%7B%22key%22%3A%22is_manager%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22Disney+International+Programs%22%7D%5D)\n- [Disney Aulani Resort & Spa](https://jobs.disneycareers.com/aulani)\n- [The Culture of DISNEY Tech](https://jobs.disneycareers.com/our-culture)\n- [Housing Information](https://jobs.disneycareers.com/housing-information)\n- [Disney Programs](https://jobs.disneycareers.com/disney-programs)\n- [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's)](https://jobs.disneycareers.com/dcl-faq)\n\nThis comprehensive report provides an overview of The Walt Disney Company, its key personnel, recent news, and additional resources for further research.",

Telling stories through technology is an honor, challenge, and an absolute delight.\n\nErin\n\nEveryone is very welcoming. From the start, I felt that my voice was heard, and my ideas were respected. The amount of genuine interactions, diversity and care for individual growth is beyond what I have ever experienced anywhere else.\n\nFranco\n\nMy favorite experience from my internship is when the project that I am contributing to, Hey Disney, was announced to the public! It was so exciting to be able to share with people the cool technology I have been working on, read my favorite Disney blogs with articles about the product, and celebrate an exciting project milestone with the team.\n\nDominique\n\nOn a daily basis, my team is working to ensure that our products are meeting the needs specified by business units across The Walt Disney Company such as ESPN, Disney+, and National Geographic. We accomplish this by troubleshooting, bug-fixing, onboarding/training new business units, and developing new tools that make our daily activities more efficient and effective!\n\nFina\n\nAt nowhere else in the world do you get to be a \"magic maker.\" I wanted to work for Disney because I wanted to be a part of the company that creates unforgettable and magical experiences for people of all ages and backgrounds. That's such a unique mission and you don't get to be a \"magic maker\" at any other company.\n\nMorgan\n\nI feel lucky to have worked with such smart and collaborative team members.

For example, my mentor suggested that I present my work at the annual conference SIGGRAPH's MaterialX session and I am grateful that I got that experience to present my Open Source work alongside other talented developers.\n\nMadeleine\n\nMy favorite experience from my internship was completing my project and delivering a finished product at the end, which could be used in production.

Each candidate will have related recent experience to the position when applying. They will also possess a proven passion for quality guest service especially within a family environment and demonstrate a commitment to safety, courtesy, inclusion, show, and efficiency. Being selected by Disney Cruise Line means you are part of something truly unique.\n\nDisney Cruise Line enables and encourages crew to develop their knowledge and skills in every single position and aims to be a culture of growth and development. Once onboard transfer requirements are met for new crew members, you can explore the world of possibilities across all of our different teams.\n\nIn addition, at the beginning of a career with Disney Cruise Line, all new crew members and officers receive in-depth onboarding and training so they are set up for success to connect with The Walt Disney Company, feel comfortable in their position, and engage with guests and crew members.\n\nEnsuring the safety of our fellow crew and guests is of the highest priority. Together, we hold one another accountable to do the right thing, maintaining our superior standard of safety and service. We are committed to acting responsibly, providing our guests and fellow crew members and officers a safe and secure environment onboard, as well as shoreside. Crew members attend in-depth training across all areas of the ship to ensure a safe and secure environment.\n\nContract lengths are based on position and operational need and vary from 3 to 8 months. The average contract length for most positions is 4-6 months.\n\nShip placement is dependent on operational needs. When a crew member is extended a contract, this is to work for Disney Cruise Line and specific ship assignments will come at a later time.\n\nWhen working onboard, crew cabin type and assignment will be based upon the position a crew member is offered. Most crew members onboard share a cabin with one or more crew members. Each cabin is functional yet small in size and equipped with an individual bed for each crew member and a bathroom, small lockable area, desk, TV/DVD player, mini-refrigerator, telephone and small closet with compact additional storage space. A limited number of positions may be assigned a single cabin.\n\nIn addition to your cabin, a variety of dedicated spaces for crew are available for relaxation and enjoyment including a 24-hour crew gym, recreation room, outdoor deck, crew pool (varies based on ship assignment) and so much more! Crew members can also grab a quick meal or sit and eat while enjoying conversation with their fellow crew members in the crew dining and bar area.\n\nCrew Engagement Managers are onboard Disney Cruise Line to provide fun and relaxing opportunities for crew members to wind down after a day at work. From trivia nights and karaoke to special movie premieres uniquely for crew members, there are a number of special experiences for the team.\n\nLocated in The Bahamas, Castaway Cay is a 1,000-acre private island in the Abaco chain of islands that is reserved exclusively for Disney Cruise Line Guests on Bahamian and Caribbean cruises. On Castaway Cay, guests enjoy recreational activities, such as swimming, snorkeling and learning about island wildlife.

During non-working hours, crew members enjoy dedicated crew amenities and natural scenery on the island. Dedicated crew areas include a 24-hour crew gym with state-of-the-art exercise equipment, a crew store and cafeteria, a crew bar, a private beach area for ship and island crew, and more.\n\nThere are a variety of opportunities spanning different job areas including Recreation, Animal Programs, Maintenance, Island Services, Security, and Administration.

This is coming from a guy who was playing console games since the 1980’s, only to give up all of gaming in order to play this for the last 6 years.  My only real disappointment with this game is the manual heart receiving.  You have to manually accept hearts sent to you within the hour it was issued from a friend for 200 coin each, and the option to accept all of it at once does not automatically return hearts to all senders; you literally have to sit there for as long as it takes and accept one by one in order to return everything that has been sent.  It totally could have had an auto-return option, even if it was a monetary (or gem) purchase option, but no, they left it without auto-returning hearts for 10 years.  Still, I like the fact that you start off with so little, and then build your way to buy random characters from a box, a premium box, a special box, a limited prize-ball machine, and free gifts every now and then.  Oh, the memories.  As I edge closer to retirement from this game, as can attest to the interesting annual events with different themes, new characters from many Disney movies and shows, each with their own special move that includes colorful graphics.  Not bad from a game where you have to match and clear stuffys!  Long live Disney TsumTsum!",

I’m an adult playing this game, I can’t imagine if a child is playing and how they would feel losing all they played with what was a very fun game that could be played without paying big bucks.

This is a fun game to play, and as long as there are no glitches, it’s worth playing.

But thanks for retrieving all lost data.\n\nThis morning I played 5 hearts, like we’ve been doing for years. I came back about an hour later, and all my game history is gone.

There’s always something to do on this game and lot to look forward to. \n\n    Unfortunately as you’re leveling up [for context I’m on level 132] the rewards decrease tremendously. Eventually you’ll be given one ruby for every level you pass. Which is weird since it used to be a variety of either skill tickets, premium tickets, and multiple rubies. Also doesn’t help that it takes longer to fill up the bar so you’d think you’d be rewarded handsomely for reaching the next level. \n\n    Another problem I noticed was the bingo cards. The rewards don’t really match the difficulty. I’ve gotten better bingo rewards on the 1-3 star (easy) cards vs. the 4-5 star (challenging) cards. Shouldn’t the prizes get better based on the difficulty of the cards? Why wouldn’t the players get better prizes on the hardest cards. Especially since you’re encouraged to spend rubies to make them easier. \n\n    Other than that, the game is still enjoyable & consistent after years of playing and there’s always something to do. Whether it’s the bingo card, time limited events, the coloring book, or the exclusive monthly cards for certain Tsums. I hope they continue to make updates and put care into it.",

After staring at my screen for another 15 minutes, and it only moving yo 40.1 out of 470MG, I decided to just give up and delete the app. I was bored and wanted to play the game, so I tried again! Same thing, only I gave up after another 10 minutes and it only making it to 1.7MG of the 470 needed. I never have this issue with any other app that I’ve ever downloaded. They always download super fast! In fact, after I gave up and deleted this one a second time, I downloaded Emoji Blitz, and it was finished downloading and ready to play in under 2 minutes. F this game! Haha",

I play it a lot, but the more I okay the more I realize there is an algorithm at work.  The odds to get new tsums aren’t boosted.  I don’t care what they say.  They just aren’t.  Currently we are in an event that is only playable with this months tsums and the only one I’ve managed to get is garbage and makes the event almost impossible.  It’s by design to get you to spend money to get coins to buy the boxes.  And 30k coins for a premium box is a LOT for how much you get per game.  You can get up to 1500 per day in missions.  But that’s it.  Typical Tsum Will average you 200-500 coins.  If you get a good one and get food with it you can get 1000-1300 a game.  But that’s still close to 30 games with 5 hearts that take 15 mins to replenish EACH.  And then when you start getting good with a Tsum…it just kind of stops falling.  I have one I can consistently break a thousand coins with and after farming her for a while she suddenly got horrible and wouldn’t fall.  Now I’m lucky to break 5-600.   I have another couple tsums I use for scoring.  If I use them too many times in a row they don’t fall right.  And the more I play consecutively (it I’ve stored up hearts) the worse ALL the tsums fall.  Make sure you don’t okay with the same one on repeat.  Mix them up.

I want to be playing not giving and receiving hearts on an hourly basis just to have coins and points. Way too tedious. I am almost at the point where I’m over playing this game bc of it. Keep in mind I’ve always been a manual sender/receiver for hearts. There are hacks to do it so it’s automatic but it’s a lot of work to set it up and it may have to be on another device that has to run all day like a laptop. \n\nAlso, when u give/receive a heart there are multiple confirmation buttons to get thru. WHYYY?? We don’t need confirmation. If I press it once, do it, don’t ask to confirm if that’s what I want to do. And this has to be done for every single one. It’s hard if u have 100+ friends. I can spend almost 20 min/hour giving/receiving hearts. And that’s not even playing the game!!\n\nThere should also be an option to purchase more skill tickets and more ways to earn rubies than purchasing them",

I have been playing it off and on for years, this is one of those games I download into every new phone I get!!! As much as I love this game there is one downside to it……. Unfortunately, sending hearts to friends (if you have 100 or more) can be a little tedious. Between having to tap each heart one by one you also have to confirm each heart being sent and tap past the confirmation of it being sent to tap the next heart to send. Only thing I ask for in this game to help make it better, is a better way to send hearts faster and easier so we’re not taking up a lot of time to send hearts to our friends every hour.

The game has been great with just a few glitches here and there over the years. But now that she’s almost 14, we were trying to figure out why she can’t log into an account. For some reason, when Line made this game they didn’t also add some sort of counter that tells them the user is now old enough to be able to have an account login. So now if she wants to create and account she will have to uninstall the app and lose SIX YEARS of progress. There’s got to be some sort of fix for this that they could do.

I spent real $ to see if I could get a new TsumTsum during lucky time.  I spent it all trying to get a new TsumTsum - and didn’t get one new TsumTsum (or a TsumTsum I didn’t already have).",

During lucky time you usually have a 2-6% chance of getting a “lucky” one, yet you will probably get one of the other 90+.

It’s always exciting to get a new Tsum you don’t have, but it’s extra thrilling to get a Tsum you keep hoping to get in order to skill up your favorite(s). \n\nOne feature I’m hoping can be added to the game is the ability to choose to have skills automatically activate as soon as the meter is filled without having to tap the skills button on the lower left. I understand that you may not always want skills to activate immediately, and that some people may want to control when skills are activated at all times.

I cannot play this game causally. It seems every time I wish to play a quick game there is an update to be loaded. And those updates are 330MB! And they will not load in the background for some odd reason, and they load pitifully slow. \n\nAt least this game is not ad-infested like every other game I try to download and play. I do give them credit there. Lately it seems that most games are half ad, half play or offer ad-free for about $100 a year. \n\nUpdate. Loss of rating star because the game will only play if I have a cell phone data connection on my iPad and have turned off my (working) wifi connection to ComCast. It is the only app that has this problem. \n\nTsum Tsum is a very simple game. It is mindless and fun to play. It is also very addictive. You will constantly run out  of 'hearts'. You can find a group on LINE to exchange hearts with. \n\nMy only complaints about the game are that it is on line only, and advancement is very slow. There are currently 52 tsums available. You need about 15 of each tsum to reach the upper levels. It takes (me) about three hours of aggressive play to earn a single tsum. And they add new tsums every month or so. You are potently looking at several thousand hours of gameplay to max things out. Of course, you could always just buy the tsums for cash.",

I really enjoy this game, except for how little playtime you get if you don’t pay, but not anymore!  If they can fix it I’m going to need to delete it and move on.  My precious downtime is more valuable than this.\n\nI really like this game overall.  The characters are cute.  I think the cards are fun.  But the current version is SO buggy.  It crashes 5-6 times every time I play.  And in the past few days. It has been stealing lives when it crashes!  The biggest drawback of the game is the long recharge time for lives (15 minutes) versus the play time, which 60 seconds per.  So just as you’re building up to being fast enough to possibly complete the challenge, you’re out of lives and have to wait an hour and fifteen minutes to get another five minutes of play time.  And when it crashes and steals one, it adds insult to injury.  Extremely frustrating.  I absolutely refuse to spend real money to play, and if my free lives are being stolen, I can only imagine how upsetting it would be to have one I paid for stolen.

I want to thank all my friends who I met through Line, FaceBook, and Discord who helped me throughout my experience with this wonderful game and want the world to know that it will always be one of the best games I had ever played.  This is coming from a guy who was playing console games since the 1980’s, only to give up all of gaming in order to play this for the last 6 years.  My only real disappointment with this game is the manual heart receiving.  You have to manually accept hearts sent to you within the hour it was issued from a friend for 200 coin each, and the option to accept all of it at once does not automatically return hearts to all senders; you literally have to sit there for as long as it takes and accept one by one in order to return everything that has been sent.  It totally could have had an auto-return option, even if it was a monetary (or gem) purchase option, but no, they left it without auto-returning hearts for 10 years.  Still, I like the fact that you start off with so little, and then build your way to buy random characters from a box, a premium box, a special box, a limited prize-ball machine, and free gifts every now and then.  Oh, the memories.  As I edge closer to retirement from this game, as can attest to the interesting annual events with different themes, new characters from many Disney movies and shows, each with their own special move that includes colorful graphics.  Not bad from a game where you have to match and clear stuffys!  Long live Disney TsumTsum!",

      "# Not Rewarded For Playing, 3 stars [(Rani.—, Apple App Store, 2024-02-21)](https://apple/10964093705)\nI’ve played this game for 6+ years because of how cute the effects were on some Tsums and because of the limited events.  There’s always something to do on this game and lot to look forward to. \n\n    Unfortunately as you’re leveling up [for context I’m on level 132] the rewards decrease tremendously. Eventually you’ll be given one ruby for every level you pass. Which is weird since it used to be a variety of either skill tickets, premium tickets, and multiple rubies. Also doesn’t help that it takes longer to fill up the bar so you’d think you’d be rewarded handsomely for reaching the next level. \n\n    Another problem I noticed was the bingo cards. The rewards don’t really match the difficulty. I’ve gotten better bingo rewards on the 1-3 star (easy) cards vs. the 4-5 star (challenging) cards. Shouldn’t the prizes get better based on the difficulty of the cards? Why wouldn’t the players get better prizes on the hardest cards. Especially since you’re encouraged to spend rubies to make them easier. \n\n    Other than that, the game is still enjoyable & consistent after years of playing and there’s always something to do. Whether it’s the bingo card, time limited events, the coloring book, or the exclusive monthly cards for certain Tsums. I hope they continue to make updates and put care into it.",

Card challenges in tsum tsum shouldn't be impossible without rubies, but some of them are, and rubies take a long time to replenish and I'm not paying real money to make a game actually playable. For a long time you could just play the game without playing a card, but now you have to play a card which is not as fun because the missions are impossible without rubies.\nThe coin cost for the gacha is ridiculously high and there is no way to get rid of tsums you don't want, so if you're trying to get a limited edition tsum from a pickup capsule and you use 30,000 coins per try & never get what you want, you can't even trade or sell back the ones you don't want & you're out of coins.

I thought, “sure why not, I have over 200GB of free storage left” so clicked “Ok” and an hour and 7 minutes later it had only downloaded 38.83 of the 470MG. So I thought, “maybe I can’t close the app and I have to wait for it to download while the phone app is open and screen unlocked. After staring at my screen for another 15 minutes, and it only moving yo 40.1 out of 470MG, I decided to just give up and delete the app. I was bored and wanted to play the game, so I tried again! Same thing, only I gave up after another 10 minutes and it only making it to 1.7MG of the 470 needed. I never have this issue with any other app that I’ve ever downloaded.

So stuck half way after completing many missions ,never being able to finish, a lot of wasted effort. Wish the tasks were more obtainable. Stuck in missions, you can’t move forward. Because of this , play gets boring and monotonous. When you do earn enough (30,000) to get a premium box you get the same characters leveled up. You could have purchased the level up for cheaper on your own, so the 30,000 coins it takes , you lose. I could level up the tsum for less, how is that the same as getting a new Tsum?",

So called “Lucky Time” is rarely lucky. For the latest event, after grinding to buy probably 40 or 50 boxes, I got 2 out of 4 of the new Tsums a total of 4 times; 3 of one and 1 of another, and they were the weakest of the bunch. This has happened to me more times than not; really tiring of this! I rarely get the paired or dual Tsums! Also the heart send receive dynamic stinks! The send one at a time is ridiculous! Why do we have the option to collect all at once, but not send all at once! Please do something to address this! Get tired of having to send one at a time while also having to tap again to confirm.

I play it a lot, but the more I okay the more I realize there is an algorithm at work.  The odds to get new tsums aren’t boosted.  I don’t care what they say.  They just aren’t.  Currently we are in an event that is only playable with this months tsums and the only one I’ve managed to get is garbage and makes the event almost impossible.  It’s by design to get you to spend money to get coins to buy the boxes.  And 30k coins for a premium box is a LOT for how much you get per game.  You can get up to 1500 per day in missions.  But that’s it.  Typical Tsum Will average you 200-500 coins.  If you get a good one and get food with it you can get 1000-1300 a game.  But that’s still close to 30 games with 5 hearts that take 15 mins to replenish EACH.  And then when you start getting good with a Tsum…it just kind of stops falling.  I have one I can consistently break a thousand coins with and after farming her for a while she suddenly got horrible and wouldn’t fall.  Now I’m lucky to break 5-600.   I have another couple tsums I use for scoring.  If I use them too many times in a row they don’t fall right.  And the more I play consecutively (it I’ve stored up hearts) the worse ALL the tsums fall.  Make sure you don’t okay with the same one on repeat.  Mix them up.

I want to be playing not giving and receiving hearts on an hourly basis just to have coins and points. Way too tedious. I am almost at the point where I’m over playing this game bc of it. Keep in mind I’ve always been a manual sender/receiver for hearts. There are hacks to do it so it’s automatic but it’s a lot of work to set it up and it may have to be on another device that has to run all day like a laptop. \n\nAlso, when u give/receive a heart there are multiple confirmation buttons to get thru. WHYYY?? We don’t need confirmation. If I press it once, do it, don’t ask to confirm if that’s what I want to do. And this has to be done for every single one. It’s hard if u have 100+ friends.

Sending hearts manually to 100+ friends is super tedious. Also, tapping the claim all button should send hearts back to the person who sent you a heart instead of having to collect their hearts one by one.",

I have been playing it off and on for years, this is one of those games I download into every new phone I get!!! As much as I love this game there is one downside to it……. Unfortunately, sending hearts to friends (if you have 100 or more) can be a little tedious. Between having to tap each heart one by one you also have to confirm each heart being sent and tap past the confirmation of it being sent to tap the next heart to send. Only thing I ask for in this game to help make it better, is a better way to send hearts faster and easier so we’re not taking up a lot of time to send hearts to our friends every hour.

For some reason, when Line made this game they didn’t also add some sort of counter that tells them the user is now old enough to be able to have an account login. So now if she wants to create and account she will have to uninstall the app and lose SIX YEARS of progress. There’s got to be some sort of fix for this that they could do.

I get so frustrated trying to get the new characters. I only try during “lucky time” when the odds of getting one of the new characters is “supposed” to be greater. Still, don’t get the new TsumTsum. When events can only be played with a new TsumTsum and you can’t get them, it is very frustrating. They have managed to program it so you don’t get TsumTsum that have maxed out; they ought to be able to program lucky time to give you TsumTsum you don’t have.

They are cute and I enjoyed getting new Tsums since they have different abilities. After awhile, all you get is repeats. The lucky time is not lucky for me and I see other reviewers have also noticed. So it’s not just me. \nThey used to rotate the premium box’s, but now there are 98 in there!  During lucky time you usually have a 2-6% chance of getting a “lucky” one, yet you will probably get one of the other 90+.  Because you can keep getting the same ones over and over again and they get stronger. To get from a skill of 4 to 5 you will need about 10 of that character and to get from 5 to 6 you will need about 20 of that character.  Since it costs 30,000 coins to buy a box, you can see how long it will take you.   I am losing interest in this game because of this \n\nThey could make this game so much better by actually making the lucky time lucky.  Also, rotate the characters in the premium boxes like they used to, so you actually have a small chance of getting  one you want.  Finally please bring back the characters that have never been back since we haven’t all be playing this game since it started and some characters have never come back.",

Once I start playing I find that I can’t put it down until I’m too tired to play because you keep wanting to earn enough coins to buy one more box, then another, and another. It’s always exciting to get a new Tsum you don’t have, but it’s extra thrilling to get a Tsum you keep hoping to get in order to skill up your favorite(s). \n\nOne feature I’m hoping can be added to the game is the ability to choose to have skills automatically activate as soon as the meter is filled without having to tap the skills button on the lower left. I understand that you may not always want skills to activate immediately, and that some people may want to control when skills are activated at all times.  So it would be great if we can have an “auto activate skills” button in the settings that we can turn on or off, similar to how gyro can be turned on or off.\n\nThank you to LINE for adding a +Combo to items! I’m able to achieve 90/100+ combos when I’m not trying but when it’s required for a mission I sometimes mess up under pressure. So this addition really helps. \n\n- Nori C",

Even we are able to open the box, we get the same tsum-tsum?: After spending LONG LONG time to get one box, there is high chance for you to get the same tsum-tsum to “raise it's skills”.

      "# Fun addictive time waster, 2 stars [(Ghost fare, Apple App Store, 2020-08-30)](https://apple/6377563361)\nUpdate. Down to one star now. I cannot play this game causally. It seems every time I wish to play a quick game there is an update to be loaded. And those updates are 330MB! And they will not load in the background for some odd reason, and they load pitifully slow. \n\nAt least this game is not ad-infested like every other game I try to download and play. I do give them credit there. Lately it seems that most games are half ad, half play or offer ad-free for about $100 a year. \n\nUpdate. Loss of rating star because the game will only play if I have a cell phone data connection on my iPad and have turned off my (working) wifi connection to ComCast. It is the only app that has this problem. \n\nTsum Tsum is a very simple game. It is mindless and fun to play. It is also very addictive. You will constantly run out  of 'hearts'. You can find a group on LINE to exchange hearts with. \n\nMy only complaints about the game are that it is on line only, and advancement is very slow. There are currently 52 tsums available. You need about 15 of each tsum to reach the upper levels. It takes (me) about three hours of aggressive play to earn a single tsum. And they add new tsums every month or so. You are potently looking at several thousand hours of gameplay to max things out. Of course, you could always just buy the tsums for cash.",

I think when offering limited time only tsums, you should usually get one of those when you buy a box!   I have recently opened about 10 premium boxes over the Lion King campaign and have yet to get one of the TsumTsums that would actually help me get bonus points!

I have had THREE hearts stolen after the game hangs then crashes so far TODAY, and I have barely played.  This is becoming untenable.  I really enjoy this game, except for how little playtime you get if you don’t pay, but not anymore!  If they can fix it I’m going to need to delete it and move on.  My precious downtime is more valuable than this.\n\nI really like this game overall.  The characters are cute.  I think the cards are fun.  But the current version is SO buggy.  It crashes 5-6 times every time I play.  And in the past few days. It has been stealing lives when it crashes!  The biggest drawback of the game is the long recharge time for lives (15 minutes) versus the play time, which 60 seconds per.  So just as you’re building up to being fast enough to possibly complete the challenge, you’re out of lives and have to wait an hour and fifteen minutes to get another five minutes of play time.  And when it crashes and steals one, it adds insult to injury.  Extremely frustrating.  I absolutely refuse to spend real money to play, and if my free lives are being stolen, I can only imagine how upsetting it would be to have one I paid for stolen.  I hope they address this issue soon.",

      "# Great, 5 stars [(giraffegirljoely2019#1, Apple App Store, 2020-05-19)](https://apple/5965880072)\nThis is such a great game.  You continue to add events and give lots of time to play them.  The only tiny thing is that you might want to change it to unless you don't complete the goal that is when you loose a heart. But if you complete the challenge (from the event because there is almost always an event going on) then you don't loose a heart.  But that is entirely a personal preference. But I 150% recommend this.  It is so fun to feel the suspense when you are about to get a new character.  I have played this for so long.   My mother doesn't play games on her phone, but she did download this.  I have never gone back.   Download this if you are looking for a pass time in the car of just because you are bored of old games.  I can promise you will not get bored of this game.",

I was ecstatic and I screamed over to my boyfriend, \"I GOT THE DISNEY JOB!!\" \n\nAfter that, I had phone calls with the recruiter to confirm salary, benefits, etc. I put in my two weeks and I started at Disney Imagineering on 26-MAR. \n\n... And I'm still here! I'm so happy to have been hired and to be working with amazing, brilliant and creative people. It's been over 3 months and I still have a lot to learn. \n\nFor those of you considering this career, just know it's a lot of hours, work and a huge learning curve. Thank you for coming with me on this journey! I still can't believe I work here. I help make the magic! \n\n\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nUPDATE: 06-FEB-2018\n\nI had an interview! \n\nI received a call around 11am on 01-FEB. It was one of the recruiters for Disney Imagineering. She went through a series of questions like my experience, salary expectations, commuting issues, etc. Then she scheduled an interview for Monday, 05-FEB in the afternoon. Woo! I was so excited about the phone call I barely remember the conversation or what I said. But I do know that I was chatting away--I was ecstatic.\n\nCome Monday, I drive off to the location and I realized how far of a drive it was. It was over an hour long and there was a lot of traffic. I might have to move for this job but it's definitely worth it.\n\nI was greeted by the admin and led into a conference room. As much as I want to describe the inside of the building, I have a feeling that that will be breaking all kinds of Disney NDAs. But let me tell you... it was amazing! Colorful, with decorations and everything was Disney! I loved it.\n\nI met with three people, one of them being my potential boss, and it went well. Up until I had a disastrous coughing fit. I still have remnants of a cold and I couldn't stop coughing at one point. So embarrassing and that might have caused me to lose this job. But! it doesn't matter to me at this point. The fact that I was a candidate out of several hundred applications really validates how valued my skills and experiences are. \n\nThe interview lasted an hour and a half (I know, super long!) and it was really fun, we mostly discussed the differences in our industries and some more technical questions pertaining to my job.\n\nI hope I hear back from them, but if not, I am so grateful for the opportunity and I will not give up the dream of working for Disney!\n\nAlso I just checked the Disney careers website. All three of my applications are still considered \"Under Review\" even though I had an interview for one of the positions. So looks like they don't don't update the site very well. A bit of a shame...\n\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\n\n31-JAN-2018\nHi all!\nI hope that this belongs here.\n\nI want to document/log the amount of time it takes for Disney to get back to you in regards to \"Professional\" careers (like project management, planner, engineering, etc.). I couldn't find a whole lot of information on \"Professional\" careers so I want to offer you all my journey... Maybe along the way a fellow redditor with experience can guide me in the right direction or at least clear the fog that has been this application process.\n\nI have been working in the project controls (scheduling and cost) side for about 5 years now.  But I'm a little tired of my current industry (it's old-fashion and not innovative). I saw that Disney Parks and Resorts (Anaheim) was hiring in that department so I decided to give it a shot.\n\nI submitted my application (including resume and cover letter) on 19-DEC-2017.\n\nI've been checking frequently on the Disney careers webpage and looks like there are 5 stages to the application process. Stage 1 is Applied, Stage 2 is Under Review, Stage 3 is Interview, Stage 4 is Offer and Stage 5 is Hired. Pretty straight forward.\nSo far my status has remained \"Under Review\". I clicked on the job number provided and it gives more a little more detail, \"We are currently reviewing your application!\" Unfortunately, it's been over a month and I'm losing hope. But then again, I'm sure Disney received several hundred applications for this role so I need to remind myself to be patient.\n\nIf you so desire, I can keep you all updated on my career application journey! Or if you have any advice (like who I should contact for status--they keep this well hidden, and for good reason!), I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nUntil next time...\n\n\n## Comment ID dtj862z with +5 score by [(LuvzDizneyWurld, Reddit, 2018-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/7ucf5h/logging_my_disney_career_application_journey/dtj862z/) (in reply to ID 7ucf5h):\nno advice to give just wishing you the best of luck.\n\n### Comment ID dtj8o27 with +1 score by [(scribbl3d, Reddit, 2018-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/7ucf5h/logging_my_disney_career_application_journey/dtj8o27/) (in reply to ID dtj862z):\nThanks! :)\n\n## Comment ID dtjoa0b with +3 score by [(AimDizzle, Reddit, 2018-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/7ucf5h/logging_my_disney_career_application_journey/dtjoa0b/) (in reply to ID 7ucf5h):\nI applied for probably 50 internships with them a few years ago and went through several interviews.  It can take a long time to hear back.  Sometimes the application will stop at a step in their system and literally never move past that until they take the listing down.  The only way to get contact information is when you are actually set for an interview.

They have numerous animal sciences internships and even horticultural internships as well. Like I said I’m no bio major so I don’t exactly know what would be 100% related to your major, but there’s a bunch of offerings for professional internships! Doing the DCP is sometimes required for getting into those internships, but doing the DCP lets you network and build relationships with those teams at special networking events so you’d have a better shot at it. \n\nthe DCP may not help your career exactly, but it could lead to possibilities to getting internships that could help your future career plans. Here’s the link for the professional internships that are with the animal programs/conversation! Some do require either previous internships with animal programs at other places or doing a college program. \n\nhttps://jobs.disneycareers.com/search-jobs?k=animal&alp=&alt=&r=&kt=1&ascf=[{%22key%22:%22is_manager%22,%22value%22:%22Professional%20Internship%22}]\n\nIf you could take some online classes and not get too far behind in your track you could open the possibility to doing internships with Disney that actually relate to your major.

I am also a bio major. While nothing I did related directly to my major it is still a huge resume booster. You are working in a very high stress situation. Everyone knows the Disney name and a decent amount of people understand what comes along with that name. It is a very respectable job position. You will learn a lot of skills with interacting with people from all around the world which is valuable in any situation! Plus like another person on this thread said, they have a lot of PI that do relate and the DCP opens the doors for them.

If you want to set yourself apart, your probably going to need to work harder then everyone else to get what you want.

I know there's programs to work at the other international parks like China or Paris.  As for Tokyo Disney, you either gotta be fluent and I mean FLUENT in Japanese with a good ass disney resume to be competitive with their work force, also I doubt they would fly you out and give accommodation unless you're in entertainment.  But, and its a big but, I've heard of cast members being recruited by the OLC for tokyo disney but its usually highly specific and not the norm.  I would say start working for disney again if possible and see where it takes you.  Also Imagineering or any creative role is another means of entry."

It would be nice to solicit feedback and input from everyone in the room, not just the loudest person who talks over others the most. The diversity training sessions are often ineffective because the people pushing around the others don't think they're in the wrong.\n\nI didn't know how unhappy I was at this job until I left. I wish anyone had cared about my career at all, or even once asked what I wanted to work on.\n\nThe only reason my rating isn't lower is because I've worked at places much, much worse than this.",

          "cons": "- Disney doesn't fire anyone who's a regular full-time employee; they just move you around if you're extremely underperforming or highly disliked by all of your colleagues. Because of that, there are some people you'll work with who are worse than dead weight. If you're a contractor or a Project Hire however, your continued employment is subject to whatever higher power decides your team's budget. This means that you can have every single coworker and leader speak up to keep you, and if there's no money in the budget, you'll get let go when your contract ends, and the dead weight (non-contractor) people on your team will get to stay.\n- Disney likes to pretend diversity is important, but you'll frequently be subject to doing secretarial, administrative work by people at your level if you're not an old white man. And no matter how accommodating you are, the moment you finally ask that you be listed as a contributor for having worked on someone else's high profile assignment, you'll be spoken down to about how ungrateful you are and the audacity of such a request. When you report this to your manager, they'll tell you that this is just how Disney is. Try to find another team or company to get out of that situation, because the people involved will not change.\n- Your growth in this company is hugely dependent on if your leader goes to bat for you. They need to actively campaign for your promotion and career growth if you ever plan on advancing past the role you were hired for. If your leader isn't inclined to do that, you won't go anywhere.\n- It is not easy to network or learn about other teams and roles. Good luck trying to find \"the team that does [x],\" because you'll be playing a long game of telephone that will likely end with you disappointed.\n- Any ideas to innovate or streamline projects and make them much more efficient are fruitless. My joy and passion for the area I worked on died because all my attempts to act on guest feedback or make life easier for groups of colleagues in other disciplines went unheeded.",

Come up with interdepartmental trying programs and development programs so that those who do come into leadership are ready and at their best. The LCC doesn't work well if it takes potentially years and in the meantime no skills are being honed. \n\nThe organization as it is, is mediocre but because of it's legacy and being a household name it's performing well when prices are constantly increased. However, this is something that will burn out eventually and many teams stamp out creativity and real talent development and innovation. Younger generations will not view the company for it's golden era legacy and it will struggle. The time to make magical enhancements is now so that there won't be struggles in the future.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "- Leadership: There are many individuals who may be great Cast Members but aren't fit for leadership. As professionals it's not something they're proficient at but get roles based off how well they interview instead of looking at all prospectives of; experience, current work, historical performances and ability to lead and develop others. Many roles within the organizational structure are repetitive and it makes the company top heavy in terms of salary. \n-Talent Acquisition: Job posting will be made, when there are already preferred candidates which wastes time and resources. Additionally, they will be very literal in how they interpret talent skill sets. If you have history within Hotel Operations or Comp they will immediately correlate everything with hotels only not realizing that you're capable of a wider range of roles. There is a stay the course mindset for a company that was built off of imagination and stepping outside the bounds. It's very interesting to see how lost the company is.\n- The perks and discounts exist to help reinvest wages employees receive back into the company, some of the discounts are about the Same as a DVC member or Annual Passholder. It doesn't come off as showing Cast Members appreciation for their hard work instead a incentive to come spend your wages when you may already be underpaid.\n-As it is the Company isn't sustainable long term, in a few decades the household name will implode on itself. The current generation of executive management, senior management and management are all contributing to it's decline. There are many who are innovators, great business leaders and operators. Sadly, they are outweighed by those who are just not meant to be in their roles. I think if pay and work culture was better from the bottom up many of them would've stayed in roles they were better fit for instead of clawing higher up to positions they're not effective in or meant for.",

The systems are terrible and barely work and the financial systems team is always short staffed and getting laid off as well, so there's no support. There aren't many events or rewards for employees. People stay in their roles forever so there is little opportunity for growth. It's also very hard to get a promotion.

They willingly block opportunities if you are not in the inner circle of who ever is in charge at the time. There is no clear direction and decisions change without rhyme or reason overnight. The goal post is always changing and because of that there are no standardized practices or processes. No one knows what is going on and everyone is fighting for their own way of working and for their own benefit. The consensus was misery on the team i was a part of.

Remove some of the unnecessary fat and redistribute that amongst the teams so that Cast Members aren't living check to check scrapping by and you can have more workers performing everyday roles so that those currently doing them aren't overwhelmed and become jaded. It will also prevent those who eventually make it into Leadership and Senior Leadership less jaded and uncaring. Come up with interdepartmental trying programs and development programs so that those who do come into leadership are ready and at their best. The LCC doesn't work well if it takes potentially years and in the meantime no skills are being honed. \n\nThe organization as it is, is mediocre but because of it's legacy and being a household name it's performing well when prices are constantly increased. However, this is something that will burn out eventually and many teams stamp out creativity and real talent development and innovation. Younger generations will not view the company for it's golden era legacy and it will struggle. The time to make magical enhancements is now so that there won't be struggles in the future.",
        "cons": "- Leadership: There are many individuals who may be great Cast Members but aren't fit for leadership. As professionals it's not something they're proficient at but get roles based off how well they interview instead of looking at all prospectives of; experience, current work, historical performances and ability to lead and develop others. Many roles within the organizational structure are repetitive and it makes the company top heavy in terms of salary. \n-Talent Acquisition: Job posting will be made, when there are already preferred candidates which wastes time and resources. Additionally, they will be very literal in how they interpret talent skill sets. If you have history within Hotel Operations or Comp they will immediately correlate everything with hotels only not realizing that you're capable of a wider range of roles. There is a stay the course mindset for a company that was built off of imagination and stepping outside the bounds. It's very interesting to see how lost the company is.\n- The perks and discounts exist to help reinvest wages employees receive back into the company, some of the discounts are about the Same as a DVC member or Annual Passholder. It doesn't come off as showing Cast Members appreciation for their hard work instead a incentive to come spend your wages when you may already be underpaid.\n-As it is the Company isn't sustainable long term, in a few decades the household name will implode on itself. The current generation of executive management, senior management and management are all contributing to it's decline. There are many who are innovators, great business leaders and operators. Sadly, they are outweighed by those who are just not meant to be in their roles. I think if pay and work culture was better from the bottom up many of them would've stayed in roles they were better fit for instead of clawing higher up to positions they're not effective in or meant for.",

It would be nice to solicit feedback and input from everyone in the room, not just the loudest person who talks over others the most. The diversity training sessions are often ineffective because the people pushing around the others don't think they're in the wrong.\n\nI didn't know how unhappy I was at this job until I left. I wish anyone had cared about my career at all, or even once asked what I wanted to work on.\n\nThe only reason my rating isn't lower is because I've worked at places much, much worse than this.",
        "cons": "- Disney doesn't fire anyone who's a regular full-time employee; they just move you around if you're extremely underperforming or highly disliked by all of your colleagues. Because of that, there are some people you'll work with who are worse than dead weight. If you're a contractor or a Project Hire however, your continued employment is subject to whatever higher power decides your team's budget. This means that you can have every single coworker and leader speak up to keep you, and if there's no money in the budget, you'll get let go when your contract ends, and the dead weight (non-contractor) people on your team will get to stay.\n- Disney likes to pretend diversity is important, but you'll frequently be subject to doing secretarial, administrative work by people at your level if you're not an old white man. And no matter how accommodating you are, the moment you finally ask that you be listed as a contributor for having worked on someone else's high profile assignment, you'll be spoken down to about how ungrateful you are and the audacity of such a request. When you report this to your manager, they'll tell you that this is just how Disney is. Try to find another team or company to get out of that situation, because the people involved will not change.\n- Your growth in this company is hugely dependent on if your leader goes to bat for you. They need to actively campaign for your promotion and career growth if you ever plan on advancing past the role you were hired for. If your leader isn't inclined to do that, you won't go anywhere.\n- It is not easy to network or learn about other teams and roles. Good luck trying to find \"the team that does [x],\" because you'll be playing a long game of telephone that will likely end with you disappointed.\n- Any ideas to innovate or streamline projects and make them much more efficient are fruitless. My joy and passion for the area I worked on died because all my attempts to act on guest feedback or make life easier for groups of colleagues in other disciplines went unheeded.",
        "lengthOfEmployment": 2,
        "pros": "- It feels really good when the work you do is finally public (if your project survives being axed)\n- There are some true gems of coworkers who are doing great work with the limited control they have\n- The work-life balance is, majority of the time, very manageable. People understand that work isn't all-consuming, unlike other companies I've worked at before. With a few exceptions close to a big launch or release date, I worked very reasonable hours.\n- It's much easier to get another Disney job if you have them somewhere in your past experience on your resume; they love to rehire ex-Disney employees.\n- It does feel good to be able to take your friends and family to the parks and buy people presents with your employee discount. You get to bring the Disney joy to other people far past the time you've lost yours. It reminds you why you did this to begin with.",

      "# [Is Disney Bad at Star Wars? An Analysis by James Hibberd on 2024-10-03](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/star-wars-disney-analysis-ratings-box-office-1236011620/)\nThere’s an exchange in Star Wars: The Force Awakens when Rey and Finn are fleeing from stormtroopers and searching for a way to escape. Rey spots the legendary Millennium Falcon, declares it looks like “garbage,” and then quickly reconsiders: “The garbage will do!”\n\nIncreasingly, that’s the attitude some fans have about Disney’s Star Wars programming: “Look, we all know this isn’t fantastic anymore, but Star Wars is still Star Wars, and, therefore, it will do.”\n\nTo be fair, Disney’s Star Wars shows and movies remain far from space junk. Their titles typically get glowing reviews from critics, and generate box office returns and streaming ratings that other studios would envy (though at a high cost).\n\nSo let’s run through Disney’s Star Wars legacy to date, from The Force Awakens to The Acolyte, and see what conclusions might be drawn. Because several aspects of the company’s track record admittedly look shaky: A five-movie franchise that was halted after its box office returns trended the wrong direction. Six live-action TV shows, just one of which has been a multi-season hit. A startling number of projects put into development and then abandoned like starships on Bracca. And one wildly ambitious role-play hotel that closed after little more than a year.\n\nIt raises a question: Is Disney kind of bad at Star Wars? Or is this a case where a very high bar for success combined with a passionate fandom’s gripes tend to obscure what is otherwise a hugely popular and lucrative franchise? Let’s take a closer look …\n\nTHE FILMS: “LET THE PAST DIE, KILL IT IF YOU HAVE TO”\n\nAfter buying Lucasfilm from George Lucas in 2012, Disney relaunched Star Wars as a franchise trilogy in 2015 with director J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens. The film was an absolute blockbuster. Yet surprisingly — and, as it turned out, problematically — the studio did not have a firm creative plan for the next two films (at least, not one that was followed).\n\nRian Johnson’s 2017 sequel The Last Jedi took the story in a different direction that many loved and many didn’t. Then Abrams returned with 2019’s The Rise of Skywalker and tried to push the narrative closer to his original intentions. Comedians learn in improv class to always say, “Yes, and …” to any idea introduced during a show, no matter how challenging. The studio and Abrams’ reaction to The Last Jedi was more like, “No, actually …” (Rey is a nobody. No, she’s a Palpatine!) The result was a trilogy that’s a mishmash of dueling creative visions. (Lucas took a similar I’m-making-this-up-as-I-go approach to his original trilogy, but it’s far easier to maintain a saga’s cohesion when all the films are led by the same person.)\n\nThe films’ box office also told a story. At a time when Disney’s Marvel movies kept breaking new ticket sales records, Force made an extraordinary $2 billion worldwide, Jedi dropped sharply to a still-huge $1.3 billion, and then Skywalker made $1 billion which is, you know, still $1 billion. These are incredible numbers for any film, but they were going the wrong way — when the third entry in your trilogy launching a new franchise sells half as many tickets as the first, you probably made a wrong turn somewhere.\n\nAround the same time, the studio experimented with two stand-alone titles. There was 2016’s gorgeous-looking and compelling, if wildly uneven, Rogue One, earning $1 billion (a film whose reputation has improved since it was released). And 2018’s widely panned Solo, which made a disastrous-for-the-franchise $393 million (a film whose reputation has not improved since it was released). Both had behind-the-scenes drama and reshoots that saw their original directors being replaced during filming.\n\nAfter Rise of Skywalker, Disney paused making big-screen Star Wars movies altogether but continued to announce new films in development from top creatives. The list of well-known writers and directors who have come and gone is comically long: Rian Johnson (originally enlisted to make a new trilogy), David Benioff and Dan Weiss (also enlisted for a trilogy), Patty Jenkins, Colin Trevorrow, Damon Lindelof, David S. Goyer, Josh Trank, Guillermo del Toro, Taika Waititi and Marvel chief Kevin Feige. Some of their projects were confidentially announced as movies that were definitely happening until they weren’t. And there are others that were never revealed publicly.\n\nIf all this seems rather chaotic for a studio that’s famously meticulous, well, yes, it does. The charitable read is that Star Wars movies should be very special and the studio is determined to get them right. A batch of projects are still the works: James Mangold is developing a Dawn of the Jedi feature, Shawn Levy is working on an untitled film, Jenkins’ Rogue Squadron was resurrected this year, and Lindelof’s feature starring Daisy Ridley’s Rey has shifted to director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy. It’s uncertain which of these, if any, will be made.\n\nEven as the studio spat out announcement after announcement on the film side, Disney largely switched its focus to bringing Star Wars to TV for its Disney+ streaming service.\n\nTHE SHOWS: “I CAN BRING YOU IN WARM OR I CAN BRING YOU IN COLD”\n\nOnce again, Disney came out of the gate incredibly strong. The 2019 debut season of Jon Favreau’s The Mandalorian nearly single-handedly made Disney+ an out-of-the box success, charmed critics and audiences, and was even nominated for an Emmy for best drama. Moreover, The Mandalorian proved live-action Star Wars on TV was possible — it’s easy to forget this show was considered a big gamble at the time (given Favreau also launched the MCU with 2008’s Iron Man, he deserves to be honored at one of those medal ceremonies on Yavin). In season three, The Mandalorian creatively stumbled a bit, ratings slipped (a little) and the show received backlash for the first time.\n\nInstead of a fourth season, Disney decided to pivot The Mandalorian to launch its first Star Wars feature film since The Rise of Skywalker. Coming in 2026, The Mandalorian & Grogu will probably perform well. Yet it also looks like Disney spent many years and untold capital struggling develop a new Star Wars movie and its best idea was an extra-long episode of a TV show.\n\nFrom The Mandalorian came 2021’s spinoff The Book of Boba Fett, which is where some problems with the franchise’s TV efforts first emerged. So much about this brief effort was weirdly clunky. Two Mandalorian episodes were inexplicably sandwiched into the show’s seven, and they felt like a Band-Aid effort to repair a struggling show. The Book of Boba Fett was originally a series, not a miniseries, but it was quickly considered concluded.\n\nThere have been four new shows since:\n\n— 2022’s Obi-Wan Kenobi from showrunner-director Deborah Chow. Fans were excited to see Ewan McGregor reprise his role as Obi-Wan and Hayden Christensen return as Darth Vader. The show was likable enough (despite some weak sequences) and a winner in the ratings: Obi-Wan Kenobi opened to 1.03 billion minutes of viewing, according to Nielsen — even bigger than Mando season three’s opening of 823 million — and concluded with a strong 860 million for its finale. Obi-Wan Kenobi was a limited series, however, and there are no current plans for more episodes.\n\n—2022’s Andor from Rogue One fixer Tony Gilroy, who returned to make a prequel series to the film he swooped in to rescue midway through production. Andor was a grown-up Star Wars title that felt grounded and heavily used practical effects and on-location filming (instead of the LED volume wall technology used by the other shows for their backgrounds, which sometimes makes them look like blurry stage plays). The show was also massively expensive, with a budget estimated to be as high as $250 million for 12 episodes. Critics and its fans loved the result, however, and Andor was Emmy nominated for best drama series. At 96 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, Andor is actually the best reviewed live-action Star Wars TV show or movie.\n\nAndor’s ratings did not fully reflect this esteem. It opened with 624 million minutes before falling into the 400 million range for subsequent weeks, then jumping back to 674 million for its finale. There will be a second season in 2025 to conclude the story. Gilroy originally pitched the show as five seasons and has said it was his decision to shorten the project. It would not be surprising if Andor‘s ratings pop for season two as more casual Star Wars fans discover the show.\n\n—2023’s Ahsoka from Clone Wars mastermind and Mandalorian co-chief Dave Filoni, now in the live-action driver’s seat for first time. The show received positive reviews (86 percent on Rotten Tomatoes) and a somewhat mixed reaction from fans. Ahsoka’s premiere ratings were comparable to The Mandalorian season three opener (829 million minutes), then it declined to average around 570 million minutes for the rest of its run. A second season was announced as in development in January, and sources say the new season will go into production next year.\n\n—2024’s The Acolyte from creator Leslye Headland. The series was set 100 years before The Phantom Menace and had franchise’s most diverse cast along with several female leads. The New York Times revealed the eight-episode series cost $180 million (only $10 million less than Dune: Part Two).\n\nThe Acolyte received largely positive critic reviews (78 percent on Rotten Tomatoes) and sparked a raging culture war battle that once again exposed the ugly side of online fandom. The Acolyte’s backlash and criticism is difficult to parse as many fans detail their creative objections to the show’s storytelling and its bold take on Jedi lore — “just because we didn’t like this doesn’t mean we’re racist,” basically. Some other Acolyte bashers were, well, clearly racist.\n\nThe Acolyte’s premiere ratings were the lowest to date for a live-action Star Wars series launch (488 million minutes, according to Nielsen’s U.S. streaming figures). Then the show’s ratings sunk further, with The Acolyte dropping out of Nielsen’s Top 10 entirely for several weeks (not typical for a Star Wars show). It was impossible for Disney to spin this one as a concluded story — the season ended on a cliffhanger — but The Acolyte is not getting a season two. The cancellation has been portrayed by some defenders as baffling, even conspiratorial, but the show’s ratings, trend and reception point to a pragmatic decision on the studio’s part.\n\nOn Dec. 3, Disney is launching Jon Watts and Christopher Ford’s Skeleton Crew, which centers on a group of children embarking on a space adventure. Making an all-ages ratings smash is difficult nowadays, so having Skeleton Crew focus on kids — like Andor is targeted to grown-ups — might be a smart play. The creators have strongly suggested the show will be another one-and-done limited series, but Lucasfilm is considering Skeleton Crew a series (unless its ratings decide otherwise).\n\nLOOKING AHEAD: “WE HAVE HOPE. REBELLIONS ARE BUILT ON HOPE!”\n\nSo that’s six live-action shows in five years. Just one — The Mandalorian — has been an outright hit with critics and fans and has delivered a multi-season run, which is the traditional model for TV success.\n\nThis doesn’t mean a single season of TV cannot be a win; limited series are considered hits all the time. But there’s a reason popular close-ended limited series like the debut seasons of HBO’s The White Lotus and FX’s Shogun were given second season orders and became ongoing series. Making a show that can run for multiple seasons is the typical goal, even for streamers, because it encourages subscribers to stick around. There are also considerable startup costs to making something new, particularly in the fantasy space — enormous amounts of production, costume and prop design, and all-around world building. The Acolyte season one took four years to make, but a second season would have likely only taken half that time. With an ongoing series, a company doesn’t have to work so hard and spend so much to keep re-earning its audience. One would think Disney would have wanted more juice from some of these squeezes.\n\nBecause what is left for Disney+ after Skeleton Crew? The final season of Andor and a second season of Ahsoka? In 2020, Disney bullishly announced 10 new Star Wars shows at an investor event, heralding a glorious new era of Star Wars TV. Those entries included Lando (now being re-developed by star Donald Glover and his brother Stephen into a film) and Rangers of the New Republic (scrapped for reasons). The prospect of being left with a single ongoing live-action Star Wars show after Andor concludes surely wasn’t the company’s hope coming out of that announcement.\n\nHanging over all of this is the increasing suspicion that the company may have wrung out the rag, creatively speaking, on storylines culled from Lucas’ original trilogy and his prequels. Even The Acolyte‘s haters should give the show credit for telling a story that’s far removed from the Skywalker Saga (as does Skeleton Crew). This isn’t entirely Disney’s fault, but it’s one the challenges moving forward. How do you make Star Wars feel fresh and new while still feeling like Star Wars and not like, say, Rebel Moon?\n\nThe company has enjoyed more consistent results on the animated side, which has been largely championed by Filoni. Shows such as Rebels (2014), The Bad Batch (2021), Visions (2021) and Tales of the Jedi (2020) were critically acclaimed and well-liked by fans (Visions and Rebels have the highest Rotten Tomatoes scores for Star Wars content; tied at 98 percent). Another title, Resistance (2018), received about one third of the Nielsen viewership of Rebels, and ended after two seasons (with its creators saying that the story was simply finished).\n\nAnd what about Disney+ subscriptions? Aren’t subscriptions the real coin of the realm here? Disney+ took off like a rocket in 2019, steadily climbed to peak in the fourth quarter of 2022 with 164 million subs worldwide, and then started dropping for the first time to currently settle around 153 million.\n\nLucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy — who has produced some of the most beloved and iconic movies in cinema history, in addition to successfully relaunching Star Wars in cinemas with Force and trailblazing into TV with Mando — has overseen the Star Wars franchise since 2012. Any mention of Kennedy amid a look at the Star Wars track record cannot be separated from the fact that she has been the target of hateful and ugly fandom attacks. South Park also piled on by mocking her in a recent episode. Still, Kennedy shouldn’t be considered immune from criticism and one thing recent political headlines have shown is the myth of “only I can do it” leadership.\n\nOn the parks front, the company doesn’t publicly release its attendance numbers for each “land,” so it’s tough to clock exactly how Star Wars land Galaxy’s Edge is faring at Disneylands across the plant. The company’s third quarter investor report stated the attraction “remains one of the most popular” in the park and ranks No. 1 in guest satisfaction (they also sold 1.2 million lightsabers, so there). But in 2023, the company’s infamous Star Wars interactive hotel experience Galactic Starcruiser, which reportedly cost nearly $1 billion, spectacularly blew up like Alderaan, shuttering its windowless “cabins” and blue-milk-slinging cantinas after one year.\n\nThe stealth goldmine of the franchise remains merchandising. Disney typically doesn’t release numbers for individual product lines, but sources say Star Wars merch generated a billion for the company last year. Baby Yoda has surely been a retail godsend (though it’s hard to imagine Bazil action figures flying off the shelves).\n\nDuring a presentation in March to fight an activist investor who accused the company of overspending, Disney also revealed Lucasfilm has generated nearly $12 billion in total revenue on its $4 billion investment. There’s so much stuffed into this fuzzy umbrella number, however, including non-Star Wars titles and projected future returns, and also so much left out (like, the cost of everything). So it’s tough to know what to make of that $12 billion other than “Star Wars generates a lot of money,” which you probably already knew.\n\nSo let us — at long last! — get back to that big question in the headline.\n\nIs Disney bad at Star Wars? … On balance, no.\n\nDisney gave Star Wars fans what they wanted for decades — a lot more Star Wars, from different visionary filmmakers, and some of it has been terrific. A dormant franchise that once followed a single dynastic storyline has exploded into a more diverse galaxy of characters and stories. Even the oft-maligned sequel trilogy has sequences within each film that are inarguably stunning (for all its narrative flaws, The Rise of Skywalker‘s farewell scene between Han Solo and Kylo Ren is as moving as anything in the canon). And shows like The Mandalorian, Andor and Rebels clear even the highest bar a hard-core fan might reasonably set. A lot of the online uproar is a sign audiences are, at least, still very engaged and care about this franchise; a truer sign of failure would be apathy and disinterest.\n\nBut here’s another question: Could Disney be better at Star Wars? … Clearly, yes.\n\nThe company’s live-action movies and TV efforts, on average, could and should be better. In 2018, Disney CEO Bob Iger admitted the company made “a mistake” with Star Wars, making movies “a little too much, too fast.” After Iger temporarily left the company in 2020, Disney/Lucasfilm arguably made the same error again on the TV side. Lucas famously instructed his actors to be “faster and more intense,” but that doesn’t typically work as a franchise strategy (as Marvel has discovered, as well). It’s unclear if Star Wars requires more order or less — more Empire-like corporate oversight or more Rebellion-like creative chaos. But it’s long seemed like there’s somehow too much of both, which has resulted in a master plan that’s constantly being rewritten, and content that sometimes feels undercooked and clunky. It’s not the fault of fans that they increasingly have “a bad feeling about this.”\n\nAny criticism from the sidelines, however, should be tempered with one final point: Making a successful Star Wars project is really hard. Marvel movies — with their iconic stable of heroes who can be portrayed by different actors — are arguably easier. Lucas created this thing and made six live-action Star Wars films over several decades, and only his first two were widely considered excellent by critics and fans alike (many younger fans adore his prequels, though they were never much loved by critics). This is also what makes making more content so tempting — the original Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back were profoundly amazing, and so captivated generations of fans, and have launched literally thousands of products and generated billions in direct and ancillary revenue.\n\nIn 1981, Lucas changed the title of his first Star Wars film to A New Hope and the name is apt — it’s literally what’s fueled studio executives, creatives and fans ever since. Each time another Star Wars title opens with a rousing fanfare, a scroll and a star field, all of us get that same feeling — a new hope — over and over again.\n\nRick Porter contributed to this report.",

Financial assets include uncashed dividend checks, shares of stock, and other investment assets.\n\nQ: How does property become “inactive?”\n\nA: In accordance with unclaimed property laws, property may become “inactive” (and presumed to be abandoned by the owner) when the owner of the property (in this instance, shareholders in The Walt Disney Company) has either not cashed dividend checks issued to them, not been in contact with Disney or its transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, for the last 3 to 5 years and/or has changed addresses without providing notification, thus resulting in the return of mail being sent to the shareholder through the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nStates require that business entities review their records each year to determine whether they are in possession of any unclaimed funds (including uncashed dividend checks), stock or other securities or other property which is inactive and presumed to be abandoned, and to report and deliver such property to the states for safekeeping. The state(s) holds the property, or its cash equivalent, until such time as they are claimed by the owner or legal claimant.\n\nIn general, property that is presumed abandoned is transferred to the state of last known address of the shareholder according to the company’s shareholder records. After property has been transferred to the state as abandoned property, shareholders must directly contact the state in order to reclaim their property. Links to individual state unclaimed property programs may be found by visiting: www.unclaimed.org.\n\nQ: Can the state take my shares if I hold a certificate?\n\nA: Yes, your stock and any uncashed checks in your account are reported to the state if the account is not kept active. Such reporting causes outstanding certificates in your possession to be cancelled and reissued in the name of the State. If this happens, the state may sell your shares. States may not notify you prior to selling your shares, and you may only be entitled to receive the sale proceeds from the state when you claim the property.\n\nQ: How should I respond if I have received a Due Diligence Letter?\n\nA: In accordance with the states’ unclaimed property laws, efforts to locate owners are generally required prior to the transfer of property into a state’s custody, typically by mailing what is known as a “due diligence” letter to the last known address on the company’s shareholder records. Upon receipt of this letter, it is very important that you immediately communicate with our stock transfer agent (Computershare Investor Services), in order to re-establish contact between you and Disney, update the status of your account, and stop the transfer of your assets to the state. If you do not respond to the due diligence letter or otherwise demonstrate contact with your account, your stock and any uncashed dividend checks previously issued to you will be required to be turned over to the state, which may sell your shares without any further notice to you.\n\nYou can contact Computershare by responding to a due diligence letter via first class mail or other priority mail service, contacting a client service representative by calling 1-855-553-4763, or logging onto www.disneyshareholder.com to authenticate your identity and demonstrate your control over your account and that it remains active. You can also request replacement of any uncashed dividend checks previously issued to you by calling 1-855-553-4763.\n\nQ: How can I keep my account active in the future?\n\nA: It is recommended that you periodically make contact with Computershare to keep your account status current. This is particularly important for accounts with shares deposited in The Walt Disney Company Investment Plan, since the automatic reinvestment of dividend payments is not recognized by the states to be an owner-initiated transaction that will prevent the shares from being presumed abandoned. You can keep your account active and avoid presumed abandonment of your stock in a number of ways, including:\n\ncontact our call center to request a statement be mailed to the address of record;\n\nlog in to your online profile by visiting www.disneyshareholder.com and review past transactions, download tax information, or update your account information;\n\nvote your proxy;\n\ncash a dividend payment;\n\nmake an additional investment in Disney shares.\n\nAdjusted Cost Basis\n\nQ: How can I determine the cost basis for my investment?\n\nA: Cost basis information will be included on IRS Form 1099-B following a sale of “covered” shares.",

      "# [NEWS: Disney World Announces Hotel Closures as Hurricane Milton Heads Toward Florida by JP on 2024-10-07](https://allears.net/2024/10/07/disney-world-announces-hotel-closures-as-hurricane-milton-heads-toward-florida/)\nWe are closely monitoring the status of Hurricane Milton as it prepares to make landfall in Florida later this week.\n\nIt was announced on October 7th that Orlando International Airport (MCO) will cease operations due to the hurricane, which is now a Category 4, but is expected to weaken to Category 3 before hitting land. Disney World has updated its hotel cancelation policy ahead of the storm as well, and now we have more updates on hotel closures affecting Disney World later this week.\n\nDisney has just sent out an update to travel agents who work with clients heading to Disney World with the following information. They stated that they are “closely monitoring the path of the projected storm, and the safety of our Guests and Cast Members remains our top priority. Walt Disney World Resort is currently operating under normal conditions and will continue to be on Tuesday, October 8th.” However, they have announced changes to the resort in the days upcoming due to the storm.\n\nDisney’s Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground, the Copper Creek Cabins at Disney’s Wilderness Lodge, and the Treehouse Villas at Disney’s Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa will temporarily close beginning at 11AM on Wednesday, October 9th.\n\nDisney’s Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground and the Treehouse Villas at Disney’s Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa are likely to remain closed until Sunday, October 13th, while The Copper Creek Cabins at Disney’s Wilderness Lodge will likely reopen on Friday, October 11th. However, these reopening plans are tentative, as it will depend on any damage from the storm.\n\nIf you’ve got a stay booked at one of these resorts during this time, we encourage calling Disney at (407) 939-5277 ASAP to inquire what options you have. Again, Disney has adjusted their hotel cancelation policy due to the storm, but Disney may also offer to move you to a safer hotel during your stay instead. If you’re already in Disney World and are staying at one of these hotels, please talk with the Cast Members at your hotel about your options.\n\nWe’ll be sure to keep you updated with all the latest Disney World updates, so stay tuned to AllEars.\n\nHurricane Milton Is Headed Towards Disney World — Should You Cancel Your Vacation?\n\nJoin the AllEars.net Newsletter to stay on top of ALL the breaking Disney News!

      "# [I Just Learned Something About Disney World That Might Fix My Single Biggest Problem At The Resort by Dirk Libbey on 2024-09-10](https://www.cinemablend.com/theme-parks/learned-something-disney-world-might-fix-biggest-problem-resort-buses)\nAs CinemaBlend’s resident theme park expert, I pride myself on my knowledge of theme park resorts. If you want to know what the best Universal rides are or what the best food at Disneyland is, I'm your guy. There’s a lot that I can still tell you about places I’ve never even been, but the fact is that places like Walt Disney World are so massive and so constantly changing that it’s impossible to know everything. There's always something new at Disney World that I don't know, but I'm not sure this piece of news is even that new, except to me. You can track Disney World buses on Google Maps, and this changes everything.\n\nDiservations is credited with the find, which in my defense, they didn’t know either before now. It turns out you can find Disney World bus stops on Google Maps. Then you can find out when the next buses arriving at that location will be getting there, as well as when they are scheduled to arrive at other places.\n\nThe Worst Thing About Walt Disney World Is Waiting For The Bus\n\nThis is an absolute game-changer. I am not overstating it when I say that waiting for Disney World buses is the absolute worst thing you can find yourself doing at the resort. I hate it. While grabbing a bus from your resort in the morning is usually no big deal, as the day goes on, it feels like whatever bus you’re waiting for never arrives.\n\nIf you arrive at a Disney World theme park bus station in the evening, only to see a bus to your hotel just pulling out, get ready, because the next one could be a long way off. It’s awful, and somehow, while you’re waiting for the next bus to your resort, three of them going to a different resort will pull up one after the other.\n\nOne of the major reasons that I don’t think park hopping at Disney World is worth it is because getting from one park to another can be a pain, and it wastes so much time that could be spent doing other things. But if I know when the buses will arrive, I can better plan my day so I’m not wasting time.\n\nKnowing Where The Bus Is Won’t Always Fix The Problem, But The Additional Information Helps\n\nTo be fair, knowing when the next bus to the place I want to go is arriving won’t fix every problem. If the next bus really isn’t going to arrive for an extended period, knowing that won’t make it come any faster. However, what it will do is provide information so that I can make the best possible choice for the situation.\n\nThere are some much more fun ways to get around Disney World, though they're not always super fast. If you're staying on the Disney World Monorail line, that's great, but the lines going back get really long at night. There are also lots of different boats that travel to various locations. They tend to not be the fastest, but they're better than waiting for a bus that isn't coming.\n\nIf I’m near the entrance of Epcot, and I want to go to someplace that is on the Skyliner route, using the Skyliner might not be that fast, if only because walking to it is going to take a while since Epcot is huge. However, if I know that the next bus to that place won’t be arriving for a long time, then maybe the Skyliner is the better choice, and at least that way I know to start walking.\n\nNow I’m in a very strange position of looking forward to my next Disney World trip so that I can actually use the bus. I want to use this and see how it changes my experience, because it truly may have fixed the one thing I don’t enjoy when visiting Walt Disney World.",

      "# [Disney Layoffs Will Affect 75 Staffers at ABC News, Local Stations by Brian Steinberg on 2024-10-02](https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/disney-layoffs-75-staffers-abc-news-stations-1236165850/)\nApproximately 75 staffers in Disney‘s ABC News and local-station operations will be laid off, part of a series of moves across the large media conglomerate that aim to cut costs amid a difficult operating environment.\n\nEmployees were notified Wednesday of the staff reductions, according to a person familiar with the matter, and the number of jobs affected is believed to be split evenly between the national newsgathering arm and the local-media business. Disney’s ABC owns eight stations in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and San Francisco. ABC News is responsible for flagship ABC programs including “Good Morning America” and “World News Tonight.”\n\nDisney has been examining its staffing and operations and has cut employees in other parts of its portfolio in recent weeks. In late September, the company eliminated about 300 jobs across different corporate departments. On Monday, the company combined some of its TV studios, merging teams previously assigned to develop scripted comedy or dram at ABC or Hulu.\n\n“Across the various ranks of ABC News, a limited number of our colleagues are being impacted by staff reductions. As you know, this has been happening across the broader company and the industry at large in recent weeks and months,” said Almin Karamehmedovic, president of ABC News, in a note to employees Wednesday. “For us, it means shaping a team that embraces the new media landscape and evolves along with it, which we must do to continue serving our viewers.”\n\n“It’s no secret that our industry is undergoing a transformation unlike any other, and we’re seeing headlines every day about streamlining across every major media company,” said Chad Matthews, president of ABC’s station group, in a memo Wednesday. “While we’re not immune to the pressures facing this business today, we have been — and will continue to be — strategic with decisions about our organization’s future.\n\nLike its rivals, Disney is grappling with a transformation of the media business, which faces a fast migration of viewers from linear TV to streaming-video services. While Disney operates streaming hubs such as Hulu and Disney+, and is developing a new ESPN stand-alone service, it does so as the economics of traditional TV, which is based on ad sales and transmission fees, are eroding.\n\nNone of the anchors assigned to ABC News’ most popular programs are expected to be affected at present, according to the person familiar with the matter. Executives believe the layoffs will not affect any national or local programming and no specific employee teams or groups are being eliminated as part of the downsizing.",
      "# [Is Disney World Closing for Hurricane Milton? by Lydia Storks on 2024-10-07](https://allears.net/2024/10/07/is-disney-world-closing-for-hurricane-milton/)\nLast Updated: October 8th at 3:45PM ET\n\nA major storm is heading straight for Disney World.\n\nHurricane Milton is forecast to hit Central Florida later this week with heavy winds and rain, and many people are preparing for the conditions the storm will bring. Because of the forecast, many people have been debating if they should cancel their Disney World vacations. But will Disney World actually close?\n\nAs of Monday, October 7th at 6PM ET, Disney World has announced the following closures and updates for its hotels.\n\nDisney’s Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground, the Copper Creek Cabins at Disney’s Wilderness Lodge, and the Treehouse Villas at Disney’s Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa will temporarily close beginning at 11AM on Wednesday, October 9th.\n\nDisney’s Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground and the Treehouse Villas at Disney’s Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa are likely to remain closed until Sunday, October 13th.\n\nThe Copper Creek Cabins at Disney’s Wilderness Lodge will likely reopen on Friday, October 11th.\n\nOn October 8th, Disney World announced closures to its parks, Disney Springs, special experiences, transportation, and more beginning on October 9th at 1PM. Here’s a full breakdown:\n\nDisney’s Hollywood Studios and Disney’s Animal Kingdom will close at 1PM.\n\nMagic Kingdom, EPCOT, and Disney Springs will close at 2PM\n\nMickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party has been canceled for October 10th. Event tickets will be refunded.\n\nDisney World Transportation will stop operating on Wednesday, October 9th after Disney Springs and the theme parks close. Limited Minnie Van and Mears taxi service will be available.\n\nDisney’s Typhoon Lagoon, Winter Summerland Miniature Golf, and Fantasia Gardens Miniature Golf will be closed on Wednesday, October 9th.\n\nDisney mentioned it is likely that the theme parks will remain closed on Thursday, October 10th. However, Disney Springs may reopen in the late afternoon on Thursday with limited offerings.\n\nThe first big update is that fees are being waived for those who want to cancel or change their Disney World vacations. Change and cancellation fees for guests with check-in dates of October 6th through October 14th will be waived due to potential weather impacts to travel plans.\n\nDisney is not enforcing cancellation policies for dining and other experiences. Pre-paid bookable experiences will be automatically refunded. Most trips can be modified online, or you can call (407) 939-5277.\n\nDisney World has also restricted reservations for hotels and parks ahead of the storm. Disney has stopped taking hotel reservations for October 8th through October 10th. Reservation options begin again on October 11th. For Disney Park Passes, the calendar has been “blocked out” for Wednesday, October 9th. If you don’t already have a Park Pass for that date, you won’t be able to make a new one at this time.\n\nAs of the latest report, after Hurricane Milton strengthened to a Category 5 storm, it decreased to Category 4, and a state of emergency has been declared for Central Florida. The forecast calls for some very rainy days in the Orlando area this week, and the roadways have been crowded with people preparing for the storm or evacuating.\n\nIf you’re wondering what it’s like when Disney World closes for a hurricane, we experienced this back in 2022 with Hurricane Ian. The theme parks and Disney Springs were closed for two days due to that storm, and then on the third day, Disney began a phased reopening. During that time, Disney World got more than a foot of rainfall.\n\nDisney World’s policies will likely be updated as the storm gets closer to making landfall, so we’ll make sure to keep you in the loop if any closures are announced.
