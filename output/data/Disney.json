      "# [Adventures By Disney](https://jobs.disneycareers.com/adventuresbydisney)\nAbout Our Trips:\n\nEach adventure has its own unique character that will appeal to different people. Some of our trips focus on the outdoors, with whitewater rafting, horseback riding and hiking being some of the optional activities. Other trips will explore highlights of cities, with historical tours, theater and gourmet meals.\n\nTrips range from 7 to 14 days in length, depending on the destination.\n\nAccommodations are among the best an area has to offer.\n\nThe platform for all trips is the authenticity of experiencing the destination while incorporating magical Disney touches and surprises.\n\nTo learn more about our destinations visit adventuresbydisney.com.\n\nAdventures by Disney Season\n\nThis year our peak season for running adventures is from May through August, with some destinations operating year-round.\n\nWho Are Our Guests?\n\nThe Adventures by Disney™ business is founded on family vacations.\n\nWe anticipate most of our guests are fans of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts® and Disney Cruise Line®, and will be looking forward to a Disney quality experience with the spotlight on the region that we are visiting.\n\nDepartures vary, but each group size will have approximately 30 - 40 guests, with a third of these being children.\n\nKnowledge\n\nThe Adventure Guides on our team will come from various professional backgrounds with diverse skill sets. However, all Adventure Guides should be thought of as experts in relation to their knowledge of the destination and Disney overall. Skill levels will vary and it is each Adventure Guide's responsibility to enhance their own skills and hopefully support their teammates in the pursuit of furthering their knowledge.\n\nAreas of expertise should include language ability, cultural and natural history, regional cuisine, travel industry logistics, basic knowledge of technology and the desire to work with people of all ages. Adventure Guides are expected to participate in all guest activities and therefore must be comfortable participating in Junior Adventurer's games and programs, swimming, hiking, bicycling, kayaking and other outdoor activities.\n\nAvailability\n\nTo be considered for the position of an Adventure Guide, you must be available to Adventures by Disney™ for travel between June through August. You will also be required to attend a week-long training session prior to beginning your trips.\n\nAdventure Guides will typically work a number of trips with slight rest periods between departures.\n\nThe amount of work will depend on our business need and an Adventure Guide's availability.\n\nTraining\n\nAll successful candidates who are hired will be expected to attend our training program. This consists of Adventures by Disney training and/or field based destination training.\n\nAll Adventure Guides will be required to complete (or show valid accreditation of) CPR and First Aid certification prior to leading a trip in the field.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow am I employed by Disney?\n\nAdventure Guides hired from outside of Disney will be employed on a temporary basis, either as a Casual Limited employee or on a Temporary Assignment. Adventure Guides hired internally (current cast members within The Walt Disney Company) may be transferred into Adventures by Disney™ for their assignments and may be transferred back to their other business unit upon completion of their Adventures by Disney™ assignment.\n\n**Eligibility for this transfer process depends on your work area, and leadership approval is required.\n\nHow much will I work?\n\nIndividual schedules may vary depending on the combination of itineraries assigned, language skills, personal interests, experience, performance history and seniority. As you grow with Adventures by Disney™, additional work could come your way in the form of more trips, administrative tasks or facilitating presentations.\n\nIs there opportunity for more work?\n\nAs a growing company, we are always looking to harness our resources. As you grow with Adventures by Disney™, additional work could come your way in the form of more trips, administrative tasks or facilitating presentations.\n\nDo I have to live where I am going to be guiding trips?\n\nNo. Generally, our Adventure Guides will reside throughout the United States and will be transported to the starting point of their trip departure prior to each adventure.\n\nDo I get to go home in between trips?\n\nIf you live in the area where you are guiding, you are free to return home in between trips when you are off duty. If this is not the case, a \"schedule-by-schedule\" approach will be taken to determine if and for how long an Adventure Guide should stay in an area in between trips.\n\nWho will I be guiding with?\n\nAll adventures are led by two Adventure Guides. You may be partnered with a local expert, travel industry professional or someone who comes from within Disney and splits their time being an Adventure Guide and whatever their role might be within the Company. Adventure Guides come from diverse professional backgrounds; however, they all share the desire to deliver exceptional guest experiences and the ability to relate to every guest on a personal level.",

To the point that for the last two years, I've been strongly trying to get a job in the Orlando area, or at Disney World itself. I've become quite adept at the latest WDW news, and every minuscule change that occurs by the park, and I am fascinated by any updates on the park.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question: I'm a writer, and ideally, I would love to find a job in the Orlando area where I could utilize my Disney-addled brain and writing skills. Does anyone know of any Disney blogs that are ever hiring (from what I can tell, most are a single or handful of people writing for them), or any jobs at Disney (I'll take Universal as well) that would be good for a writer?\n\nThanks for any help!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Comment ID eigpbzm with +13 score by [(Sprag013, Reddit, 2019-03-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/b0rmde/desperately_want_a_disney_worldrelated_job/eigpbzm/) (in reply to ID b0rmde):\num I mean honestly you really need to go and contact their HR departments and/or jump on LinkedIn.....

I bet they would want someone with an expansive portfolio and real knowledge about the inner workings and history of the parks, along with keeping up with the current ongoings at Disney. If you want to set yourself apart, your probably going to need to work harder then everyone else to get what you want.

Partners pays most of its people the bare minimum, because most people who take the job want the benefits.\n\nThat said, a WELL WRITTEN resume that will pass the scrub test will get you farther than any amount of actual experience.

That may or may not include Disney PIs, depends on what direction you go in and what professional internships/programs might be available at that time that are relevant to your experience and goals - they do change and evolve over time, so no idea what might be up when you get to say your junior year of college.\n\nI did not do the DCP, applied and was accepted but had simultaneous PI apps in for the same season and ended up accepting one of those and rescinding my DCP offer. Did another PI two years later, and extended that into what was at the time called the Management Internship - all this to say you can get a PI without doing the DCP. *I was an older applicant/participant and had work experience, although not in the area my PI was in (Costuming), my degree is in Chemistry. All in how you present yourself, frankly \n\nTo get a good job with Imagineering I feel like you almost “need” to have a few years of outside work experience, niche experience even, to really get in there the right way, although I’m sure it’s possible to leverage say a PI with them into an entry level role. But if you wait and do it the “right way” it’s just a matter of waiting for the perfect opportunity to drop so you can apply, leverage your outside experience and any DCP/PI history to get the real 💰.

And I believe that happened because someone else had beat me to the position but then wasn't able to accept it due to visa issues, so they had to sort that out, and then contact me as the runner up. Stuff like that happens all the time and it takes a while for them to work through the applicants. \n\nBut again, I would ask a recruiter personally. It could also just be that they haven't updated the system. If the position you applied to starts very soon or has already started, then it's likely that the info hasn't been updated yet and you haven't made it this time. But if it's still a while aways, then it's possible they're still working through applicants/accepted people until the position is definitively filled before they send out official rejections.\n\n## Comment ID hc7oq5q with +2 score by [(colorstoobright, Reddit, 2021-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/pkwmmw/disney_application_process_question/hc7oq5q/) (in reply to ID pkwmmw):\nI’ve interviewed at Disney for a non-Animation related job. They do take forever sometimes to reply, and that’s even before Covid. Be patient and apply to other jobs, don’t put all your eggs in this basket.\n\nGood luck!\n\n## Comment ID hc7bu28 with +1 score by [(EfficientGuarantee49, Reddit, 2021-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/pkwmmw/disney_application_process_question/hc7bu28/) (in reply to ID pkwmmw):\nTry not to stay focused on just applying online. If you can, go in and make yourself known that your interested in a position. It kind of gives a face to the application.\n\n## Comment ID hce0lz1 with +1 score by [(what1226, Reddit, 2021-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/pkwmmw/disney_application_process_question/hce0lz1/) (in reply to ID pkwmmw):\nFirst time I applied to Disney animation it was three months until my status changed to a rejection.  Second time it took a month until it changed to an \"under consideration\".\n\nApplying to Disney you just got to send and forget.  They take forever as I am learning.  \n\nIf your still interested in Disney, they are starting to post actual job opportunities for their new Vancouver studio (animation positions have no been posted yet).\n\n## Comment ID hi6p5m6 with +1 score by [(rhythm_lick, Reddit, 2021-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/pkwmmw/disney_application_process_question/hi6p5m6/) (in reply to ID pkwmmw):\nI applied to the layout trainee on the 17th, and it went from \"under review\" to \"in consideration\" the next day. So I guess there really is no set time when it happens. I'm in the same boat where I'm just wait to find out if I'll get am interview or not. Lowkey freaking out over it haha"
