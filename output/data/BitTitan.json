      "# [Secure Cloud Migration with BitTitan MigrationWiz on 2022-11-30](https://www.bittitan.com/security/)\nSecurity and Compliance\n\nAs an IT professional you need to be able to assure your clients that their data is secure at every step of the process—not just once it’s in the cloud. We take the security and compliance of your clients’ data very seriously.\n\nAt BitTitan, we take data security and privacy very seriously. Our product has been used to migrate Fortune 100 companies, American and foreign governments, police departments, banks, stock exchanges, telecoms, hospitals, and healthcare organizations – all with very stringent security requirements. Read the BitTitan Security Overview White Paper attached below for a more detailed view of our policies.\n\nISO Certifications\n\nISO 27001 – The world’s best-known standard for information security management systems (ISMS). ISO 27001 means BitTitan has put in place a system to manage cybersecurity risks that respects best practices and principles of the International Organization for Standardization.\n\nISO 27701 – Built to complement ISO 27001, this standard specifies requirements and provides guidance for a Privacy Information Management System (PIMS) for personal data. This framework allows you to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements including GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\n\nZero Deployment\n\nBitTitan products operate outside of the firewall and connect to messaging systems the same way any external user would. There is no need to install third-party software inside of your firewall or network.\n\nMailbox Data\n\nMailbox data (including subjects, bodies, attachments, etc.) are not stored on our servers. In some cases, the data may be cached temporarily in order to optimize network throughput. If cached, rest assured that your data is wiped immediately once that mailbox is done migrating.\n\nMailbox Credentials\n\nMailbox credentials are stored using military-grade AES encryption. The credentials are immediately purged from the system once you delete the corresponding configuration to which it is associated.\n\nAuto-Purge Policy\n\nWe have implemented an automatic purge policy that will delete any configuration that is not used. If no migration has been performed within 90 days (either of your last migration or creation of configuration, whichever is later), we will delete the data from our servers. You can configure this to be a longer or shorter period.\n\nData Centers\n\nBitTitan leverages Azure data centers, which are compliant with ISO/IEC 27001/27002:2013, SOC 1 Type 2 and SOC 2 Type 2, PCI DSS Level 1, FISMA, HIPAA/HITECH, CJIS, CSA CCM, FERPA and others. Customers can select from a variety of data center regions in which migrations will be processed. We offer data center locations in ​Australia, Europe, North America, Japan, South America, and Southeast Asia.",
      "# [Teams Chat Migrations on 2025-03-11](https://get.bittitan.com/teams-chat-migrations/)\nMicrosoft Teams Private Chat Migrations\n\nWe designed our Teams Chat migration solution to be as simple as a standard mailbox project—no special training or professional services required. Our User Migration Bundle includes Teams Private Chat migration. You can use private chat for free while in Preview – simply log in to your account to get started.\n\nWhat to Know When Migrating Teams Private Chats\n\nBefore embarking on a Microsoft Teams migration, you’ll want to familiarize yourself with how Teams Chat migrations work. This is because currently Microsoft Teams chats can only be migrated using Microsoft APIs. The best way to use those APIs is with MigrationWiz.\n\nTeams Private Chat Migrations (Preview)\n\nExperience enhanced Teams Private Chat migration with MigrationWiz, now replacing Teams Chat mailbox migration. Our solution supports a wide range of chat elements, including meeting chats, 1:1 chats, group chats, chat titles, rich content formatting, replies/threads, emojis, GIFs, stickers, and long text messages. Currently available for free during the Preview phase, this functionality will later require a User Migration Bundle license. Simply log in to your account to get started or for step-by-step guidance, visit the BitTitan Help Center.\n\nFull Chat History\n\nUsers’ chat threads are stored as an HTML file. MigrationWiz automatically generates an HTML file at the time of migration. These files are securely stored in the destination service account’s OneDrive and shared with the respective users.\n\nStreamline Migrations\n\nSpend less time setting up your migration projects by using an Advanced Option to filter Source users based on their security group.\n\nProtect Migrating Data\n\nCreate an IP-based lockdown that restricts access to a defined set of whitelisted IP addresses during your Teams Private Chat migration. All data – including usernames, passwords, and documents – is also fully encrypted in transit and at rest.\n\nRegional Controls\n\nRegional controls automatically direct Teams Private Chat data to the appropriate data center based on your preferences.\n\nMulti-Pass Migrations\n\nYou can perform multi-pass migrations without duplicating previously migrated data.\n\nCloning Projects\n\nBy duplicating your settings, you can save valuable time when setting up multiple MigrationWiz projects.\n\nKnow the limitations while in preview\n\nIt’s important to understand the limitations of Microsoft Teams Chat migrations as you plan your project. Good communications are key to any migration project, and in this case, you’ll want to make sure your clients and end users know what to expect:\n\nOnly users with Microsoft Teams and OneDrive for Business licenses can have their chats migrated.\n\nAlthough seemingly the same the process for migrating Teams conversations (conversations that are in Teams channels) migrating 1:1 type chats use different APIs.\n\nEvery chat, including 1:1 chats, needs a service account to export and import. This ends up turning 1:1 chats into group chats. Due to the need for the service account to be added to the rehydrated chats. Once the chats are migrated, a cleanup pass can be run to remove the service account from the rehydrated group chats and return them to 1:1.\n\nChats that were initiated by external users will not be able to be read by the API since they’re not part of the migrating tenant.\n\nIf you’re working on a full Teams migration, it is recommended to run Teams Private Chat separately and last.\n\nLooking for Microsoft Teams Migrations?\n\nWith the Collaboration license, you can migrate Teams, Channels, Files, Conversation History, and more between Microsoft 365 tenants.",

If you send an email, you may get a reply  3-4 days later with weblinks that we have already read. \n\nHere is our issue. We have no problem creating the Project in BitTitan for GSuite email to Office 365 migration. It works as advertised. \n\nIf we create a New Project  for Documents (GDrive to OneDrive), we do not have an option to select Google Drive (Own Service Account), upload a JSON file and enter Super Admin credentials. We can only select Google Drive, then One Drive (Destination) and Advanced Options. Because of this, it will fail validation.\n\nThanks in advance\n\n## Comment ID i77g43s with +14 score by [(yothhedgedigger, Reddit, 2022-05-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/uhp9r0/bittitan_support_is_a_mess_need_insight_on/i77g43s/) (in reply to ID uhp9r0):\nI'm sorry I don't have an answer, but I did want to confirm that support is almost nonexistent there now.

      "# Post ID 5r7lcv: Burned by BitTitan, need new ideas for O365 Migrations with +9 score by [(tommucha, Reddit, 2017-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5r7lcv/burned_by_bittitan_need_new_ideas_for_o365/)\n**TL;DR - DeploymentPro is broken on the back end, what else do people use for Outlook profile migrations, either standalone or a full migration product?**\n\nWe've used SkyKick before and for more than double the price of BitTitan, I wasn't happy with what it does.  Any other 3rd party tools out there that at least can do Outlook profile migrations?  I'm going to look more into the minimal hybrid option and use MRS moves, but documentation is very limited on the new minimal hybrid so I need to lab it out with some MS Partner hours to help.  While the minimal hybrid may be my answer, it won't be a fit for all projects.  \n.\n\nThe story below:\n\nWe've used the BitTitan family of products for 20 or so Office 365 migrations so we're fairly comfortable with the software. On our last project, DeploymentPro left us standing there with having to manually configure 100 Outlook profiles.  If you don't know what DeploymentPro is, it reconfigures Outlook profiles on the desktop, saving lots of time in a migration.\n\nYesterday was cutover day.  MigrationWiz worked fine, but DeploymentPro was throwing errors on the client side and the management website.  Check the status page - Degraded Performance for DeploymentPro with no other details.\n\nWith no phone number to call to talk to a person, we start a chat.  Can't help in chat, someone will followup in 24-48hrs.  After letting that soak in, we shelled out the $250  to get someone on the phone only to find out there is a known issue with the SQL server used for DepoymentPro losing connectivity/going offline and there is no ETA on the fix.  If it's not back up, they'll refund the money for DeploymentPro, and hopefully the $250 premium support.  I'm not going to rant about the practice of leaving something that's broken in production, that's reserved for a cold beer at the pub.\n\nSo now its a mad rush to configure 100 PCs over 3 locations.  It happens, suck it up and get the job done.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID dd5uxnt with +10 score by [(bittitansupport, Reddit, 2017-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5r7lcv/burned_by_bittitan_need_new_ideas_for_o365/dd5uxnt/) (in reply to ID 5r7lcv):\nHi Tom, Dominic with BitTitan Support.\n\nFirst of all, I'm terribly sorry you had a bad experience using DeploymentPro and had to manually reconfigure ~100 desktops.\n\nYour money will be 100% promptly refunded. Regarding premium phone support licenses, we always refund those if the issue is on our end of things (which is the case here).\n\nOur investigation showed the following:\n\t1. You are using the legacy version of Deployment Pro (https://community.bittitan.com/partners/Pages/Partner%20Portal/Miscellaneous/DeploymentPro.aspx).\n\t2. We recommend switching to the new version for future projects (http://blog.bittitan.com/preview-snazzy-new-deploymentpro) - see benefits.\n\t3. We acknowledge and understand the root cause of the issue you experienced. It is related to a Microsoft SQL performance issue. We've contacted the vendor (Microsoft) and posted a notification as soon as we were aware of the issue (http://status.bittitan.com).\n\nIn addition to your full refund, we've also deposited 25 free Deployment Pro licenses to your account.\n\nAgain, we're sorry about the inconvenience and are confident you will have an improved experience using new version of Deployment Pro.\n\n### Comment ID dd6bst3 with +2 score by [(emeffinsteve, Reddit, 2017-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5r7lcv/burned_by_bittitan_need_new_ideas_for_o365/dd6bst3/) (in reply to ID dd5uxnt):\nI've got a potential project migrating 14 mailboxes from one Office 365 account to another.

I'll review the links you've provided and review the steps with the team to make sure this doesn't happen again.  \n\nWhen we go kick off migrations, we normally don't go checking the status pages to make sure everything is in the green,  I'll be adding that to our checklist.

I don't remember the error/ issue but DP completely failed even though it worked for my previous tests. (I will find the support ticket today and share it). I contacted them right away via chat. They said 1-2 day response. No good. I bought a premium support ticket and someone called me in about 1.5 hours. They looked at it and said \"I see there is an issue with our server.\" They didnt have an ETA though. So I contacted the client and pushed migration by a week. Ugh. HOPING DP would be working.

It was for the new version using DMA, not the legacy one. I was migrating 300 users from Exchange hosted to Office 365. Testing on a couple of machines went perfectly.\n\nFirst, the DMA agent used up all of the available drive space on every workstation. The agent had a bug that kept generating new log files. That was a major problem that we had to deal with. I called BitTitan support and they told us to delete the log files and told me they were knew about the bug and were working on an update that would get automatically pushed down to the workstations when it was available.\n\nSecond, the new updated DMA agent that BitTitan released that night to fix the bug, was never reporting back to the BitTitan DMA servers. We had no idea because you have to look in a different area of the portal to see this info. The DeploymentPro console showed the agent successfully installed but under they only show the last heartbeat received under the DMA console. Very confusing and unintuitive interface.\n\nThird, we had a made a change to the naming convention for our Office 365 users after this MigrationWiz/BitTitan project was created. Support showed me how to change the destination address in the DeploymentPro console for each user, manually. But when you made the change it was never reflected in the console. It continues to show the previous name. Support told me that is a bug in the interface but he was sure thru his testing that the backend was successfully updated. And because it did not reflect the proper destination name after making the change, I had to schedule the agent to run instead of kicking it off when I was ready. Not ideal in this situation.\n\nNo fast forward a couple of days to the day of the cutover and all of these bugs made for the perfect storm for my customer. The schedule never started on half of the machines and on the other half the agent would hang and never continue. We had about an 80% failure rate.\n\nIt turns out that the new updated agent never checked in to the BitTitan servers so it never received the updated destination name or the schedule that I set. Support said we would have to wait 24 hours for a call back. I checked with support again an hour later when we were getting no where with our efforts to get Outlook working again. I was told this time that we could pay $250 for priority phone support. By the time we got support we needed and got to the root of the problem it was too little, too late. The whole day was shot. We got everyone back online after visiting most workstations but many of them did not get their nickname cache or their rules migrated over.\n\nI believe the customer was able to get a refund from BitTitan for DeploymentPro but the product really killed us and I would not feel comfortable using it again in the future.\n\n### Comment ID dd9f8fa with +2 score by [(tommucha, Reddit, 2017-02-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5r7lcv/burned_by_bittitan_need_new_ideas_for_o365/dd9f8fa/) (in reply to ID dd8tksx):\nWow that doesn't sound like a good time, thanks for sharing your story.

Friends of mine have used Skykick and love it but it is more expensive. Skykick does everything for you. It is especially good for an Office 365 tenant to tenant migration because it will deprovision the domain from the old tenant and add it to the new tenant for you.

      "# Post ID 1ebzo7d: BitTitan/MigrationWiz is broken; no public comment and no refund. with +29 score by [(L0ngpants, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ebzo7d/bittitanmigrationwiz_is_broken_no_public_comment/)\nIn the same vein as Intel's recent behavior being hush-hush about defects until public backlash, BitTitan is covering up massive problems with their Gmail API integration.\n\nEDIT: for clarity, Google Workspace is the destination in this case. It is a Workspace->Workspace migration.\n\nI had to fight tooth-and-nail to force them to investigate far enough to recognize the issue is on their end. They admitted it was their problem and their dev team was engaged in working on a fix, but that has gone on for 60 days now. Despite insisting several times, they refuse to provide any timeline.\n\nHere are the main points underlining their unacceptable response to this issue:\n\n1. They flippantly suggest switching to imap, but \"note that this will duplicate content\". They're joking, right? They know that clients won't be happy with this and a massive amount of effort will go into cleaning out the old content to start fresh.\n2. They're dragging their feet and taking no responsibility. Any org worth their salt would have proactively offered a refund before we reached 60 days of no resolution.\n3. They refuse a refund. The \"Technical Support Manager for US Region\" (and now the \"head of support for the whole org\") themselves stated \"refunding the license is not possible because I could see that you have already migrated some data\". Can't make this stuff up, folks.\n4. Licenses are still on sale, with no warning posted on product page; no warning at checkout; no warning during project setup; no warning on blog, website, support site, or status dashboard. They do not care that their product is broken, and that many others will spin up projects only to get half way through before discovering this disaster; I'm sure they will be refused refunds, as well.\n\nIt has been a long time coming with MigrationWiz, but I think this is the last straw. I cannot in good faith ever recommend this product again. It has consistently gone down-hill year after year.\n\nAMA, leave your condolences, or let me know what alternatives you're liking better. I'm going to be trying AvePoint Fly shortly. It's going to be an annoying few weeks while I clean this mess up.\n\nUPDATE: supposedly my ticket made it to the head of support across the whole org. Still refusing refund. Apologized for the frustration but still offered no timeline or commitment to resolution. Offered me 2x the licenses in lieu of the refund... totally tone deaf. What am I going to do with free licenses for a product I can't trust?\n\n  \nUPDATE 2: they replied to my ticket to let me know that a status message is now posted on their status dashboard here [https://status.bittitan.com/](https://status.bittitan.com/) . Unfortunately, they knew about this issue for at least 60 days but have only begun showing this message now. I can confirm that I checked this status page prior to writing this post.\n\n## Comment ID lewbh8u with +27 score by [(BawdyLotion, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ebzo7d/bittitanmigrationwiz_is_broken_no_public_comment/lewbh8u/) (in reply to ID 1ebzo7d):\nSorry it's my fault.\n\nEvery time I've used BitTitan they have an outage the day I go to use it.\n\nI had the start of a gsuite to 365 migration meeting scheduled literally 5 minutes from now that I was planning to use BitTitan for.

I did a prestage migration for everything up to 30 days, and on the day of final migration. I ran the final migration multiple times to be safe. However, recently I had one user complain that his entire 2020 year of his calendar was missing. I reported this to MigrationWiz, who recommended I reset statistics and run a full migration again. This time, it found more than 6000 items that were missed the first time. So, I reset statistics again, and ran it again, and it found hundreds of items missed. I had zero errors. I would not recommend anyone use this product ever again.\n\nI spent about 2 weeks recently writing a program using AI that helps me migrate mail using Graph API and I have successfully tested it on some test mailboxes. I am not experienced enough to use it for any production environments, but I would love it if someone with actual programming skills can make some competition here. I definitely cannot use an app that is moving hundreds of thousands of emails, and will miss things.\n\nAlso, their documentation is bad. I saw someone saying they have good documentation, but it is definitely not good. I have been in IT for 20 years and was an Exchange tier 7 for many years. I liked the convenience of something like MigrationWiz, but when the mailboxes appear to be the same on both sides, only missing a handful of items in each mailbox, what exactly am I supposed to do when the scan says all the files are the same? I trusted the system too much and became complacent! I should have checked the actual number of items, but some of my these users have hundreds of folders, which is wild to say the least.\n\n## Comment ID lewuwca with +1 score by [(djweis, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ebzo7d/bittitanmigrationwiz_is_broken_no_public_comment/lewuwca/) (in reply to ID 1ebzo7d):\nI figured out the built in 365 migration tool and moved a customer over in the time it took for BitTitan support to reply to a similar issue I was having.\n\n## Comment ID lewxceo with +1 score by [(PEBKAC-Live, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ebzo7d/bittitanmigrationwiz_is_broken_no_public_comment/lewxceo/) (in reply to ID 1ebzo7d):\nWell this is very interesting, I have just sent an email to them today requesting a refund for a failed GSuite to SharePoint migration.\n\n\nOur engineer has been battling with as their support as it has taken 2 weeks for 300Gb of data to migrate.\n\n\nYet we have cancelled and manually migrated the data and did 300gb in a day.\n\n\nI got involved today as our client was hugely unhappy with how long it is taking, so have now asked for a full refund.\n\n### Comment ID lewzty4 with +1 score by [(L0ngpants, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ebzo7d/bittitanmigrationwiz_is_broken_no_public_comment/lewzty4/) (in reply to ID lewxceo):\nGood luck, I'd love to hear what the result is...\n\nMy issue was Gmail-specific but based on how they handled this, I would not be surprised if their whole system is held together with duct tape and bubblegum.\n\n#### Comment ID lfgiaxs with +1 score by [(PEBKAC-Live, Reddit, 2024-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ebzo7d/bittitanmigrationwiz_is_broken_no_public_comment/lfgiaxs/) (in reply to ID lewzty4):\nWe got an email Friday night asking for a Teams meeting on Monday.

Their shared files was on a single users Google Drive which I then had to migrate to Teams/SharePoint.\n\nWhen I tried to specify the URL of the SharePoint-site I wanted the files migrated to, I discovered that BitTitan instead created a folder on their their 'Default' SharePoint Site with the name of the URL I specified. I tried several times, and could only migrate to that same Default SharePoint site, no matter how I tried to specify a different SharePoint Site.\n\nBitTitan's documentation and the GUI does not match, so I decided to make a Ticket since I'm going to do a similar migration for another Customer shortly. \n\n\nThe headline of my ticket: \"Unable to migrate to SPECIFIC SharePoint-site\" and I was careful to describe my failed attempts, relevant URLs etc.\n\n\nSince I had a deadline on the first migration project I decided to complete the migration via the 'detour' over the Default SharePoint Site: Google Drive >>> Default Site (using BitTitan) >>> Move files to correct SharePoint Sites.\n\n\nAfter a week BitTitan told me, they would close the Ticket: \"I checked your project above and am glad to see that your item has migrated successfully now.\". \n\nI told them not to close my ticket: Yes, I had made my migration, BUT NOT TO THE SITE I WANTED TO MIGRATE TO.

Or do we unassign licenses from source tenant and assign them to the users from destination tenant? Would Bittitan work if source mailbox don't have licenses asigned?\n\nThanks!\n\n#### Comment ID eyrhjsa with +1 score by [(msp4msps, Reddit, 2019-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Office365/comments/c88kk0/tenant_migration_exchange_sharepoint_onedrive/eyrhjsa/) (in reply to ID ey4338f):\nYou will need 1 migrationwiz license for the mailbox and 1 for the onedrive data per user. Same for each document library you plan to migrate. The mailbox migration will not work if there is no license assigned to the user unless that mailbox is a shared mailbox.\n\n## Comment ID eskthva with +5 score by [(toanyonebutyou, Reddit, 2019-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Office365/comments/c88kk0/tenant_migration_exchange_sharepoint_onedrive/eskthva/) (in reply to ID c88kk0):\nBit titan makes a tool for mail and I think SharePoint called migration wiz\n\n## Comment ID esl4837 with +1 score by [(bda002, Reddit, 2019-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Office365/comments/c88kk0/tenant_migration_exchange_sharepoint_onedrive/esl4837/) (in reply to ID c88kk0):\nI use the Quest On Demand email migration tool do move things between tenants.

Bit Titans support article is 11 pages long and has you running multiple power shell commands and creating accounts and applying special permissions and then manually pushes some processes. \nAfter all that was done it still didn’t work. We opened a ticket saying the article was completed and it didn’t work (obviously we provided way more detail) and after two days support responded with a link to the article we said we had already followed. And it cost $159 for a public folder\n\n\nSkykick required a public folder be created on the Tennent and then you point skykick at and boom done. Cost was $29. \n\nIt’s night and day difference and their support is great. Sign up as a partner and their pricing is great as well\n\n### Comment ID j62cx1d with +2 score by [(Nepenthe_x64, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/10lxlkc/alternatives_to_bittitan/j62cx1d/) (in reply to ID j5zkq4y):\nI’ve used SkyKick for years when Hybrid isn’t an option and mostly had good luck, but the last three times times I’ve used them they’ve continuously dropped the ball requiring dozens of support calls to resolve and even data loss to the point that a painful PST export / import would have been a better solution.

Yes, I know you can use the SPMT for files. But they're no help with Teams.  Bittitan is a single pane of glass in these cases.   \n\n\nEach time I submitted a question to Skykick support, it took 2-3 days before I received a response. This happened more than once. Though I believe their support is still US based.   \n\n\nBittitan responded within 2 hours each time I submitted a question. Though it's true that Bittitan has struggled these last few years. Not US based support for sure.   \n\n\nSkykick seems to be moving away from migrations and more towards backup and cloud management.   \n\n\nThat's my experience.

They barely got the client working before Jan1st deadline for basic auth removal. We had a migration that spanned Dec 20 - Jan 10.\n\nThe download links downloaded V7, we had to go back and remove V7 and install v9 manually. \n\nOnce we got V9, it failed to detect profiles. This involved a support ticket that spanned a week of faffing around with support emails\n\nThe agent failed on a number of computers at cutover, and we did it manually.\n\nIt'll be the last time i use skykick for a migration.

      "# [BitTitan Launches MigrationWiz Active Directory Migration Solution by Ankur Garg on 2024-04-02](https://get.bittitan.com/blog/bittitan-news/bittitan-launches-migrationwiz-active-directory-migration-solution/)\nThe new migration feature enables end users to transfer identities and organizational unit structures from one AD environment to another\n\nAUSTIN, Texas – April 2, 2024 – BitTitan, the global leader in managed services automation, today announced the launch of its Active Directory (AD) migration tool for MigrationWiz. The new solution simplifies end users’ ability to transfer identities and organizational unit (OU) structures, including user accounts, groups, and other related objects, from one AD environment to another. This new feature allows IT professionals to not only migrate AD objects, but also easily transition to other workload migrations such as mailboxes or shared files for easier migrations and greater data fidelity.\n\nWith no disruption in work or access during the migration process, end users can now automate migrations within MigrationWiz for a continuous transition of AD data and configurations to a new or existing on-premises AD environment, setting the stage for synchronization to Entra ID, formally known as Azure AD.\n\nAs a cost-effective solution compared to manual migration processes, the MigrationWiz AD migration tool offers minimal downtime so users can access their data as soon as possible. In addition, it provides a seamless migration process that preserves data integrity while reducing the need for manual intervention and reduces the risks of errors.\n\n“When it comes to our migration needs, we need a tool that is reliable, efficient, and practical,” said Mark Rochester, Cloud Architect, The Cloud Geezer YouTube Channel, and Industry Expert. “This new functionality significantly automates the Active Directory migration process for our customers, enabling us to easily provision everything we need for the migration to the new destination. With this new AD migration tool, we can execute even more migrations effectively, helping to meet our business goals and improve user experience for our IT teams.”\n\nMigrationWiz’s new Active Directory migration solution offers several features and capabilities to end users, including:\n\nAutomatic discovery and migration of AD objects, including users, groups, and sub-OUs.\n\nPassword synchronization between the old and new AD environments for a seamless user experience.\n\nReal-time progress tracking that allows administrators to monitor migration status and identify issues or errors.\n\nAdvanced mapping and filtering for administrators to map source and target AD objects and filter out unwanted data.\n\nIntegration with other MigrationWiz tools that migrate Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive for a comprehensive migration solution. Users migrated through the tool are automatically set up for a mailbox or document project if needed.\n\n“As mergers, acquisitions, and cloud consolidation persist, the demand for migration solutions continues to grow, compelling companies to seek reliable tools to effortlessly streamline these processes and accommodate diverse migration needs,” said Shane Daugherty, Manager, Technical Services Specialist Team at BitTitan. “Our new advanced solution enables IT professionals to complete Active Directory migrations without headaches or stress. MigrationWiz AD Migration provides the ability to complete Microsoft 365 migration projects with one single tool, automating the process while improving end results and user experience.”\n\nThe Active Directory migration license is priced per user and is an efficient first step to migrating mailboxes and OneDrive with BitTitan’s User Migration Bundle (UMB).

      "# [BitTitan T2T Migration Without MPN ID](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/microsoft-365/bittitan-t2t-migration-without-mpn-id/4140152)\nHello Community.

      "# [How to Migrate from Intermedia to Microsoft 365 using BitTitan by Isabel Claassen on 2024-10-25](https://moremax.net/intermedia-microsoft-migration/)\nMigrating email and data from Intermedia to Microsoft 365 might feel overwhelming, especially when dealing with multiple mailboxes, user permissions, and data integrity. Fortunately, BitTitan’s MigrationWiz tool simplifies this complex process by automating key steps and providing a straightforward approach to data transfer.\n\nWith the right preparation and tools, you can ensure minimal disruption to your team and maintain full control over the migration.\n\nBelow, we’ve outlined a detailed, step-by-step guide to help you transition smoothly, so you can start leveraging the full power of Microsoft 365 without the hassle.\n\nStep 1: Set Up a Migration User on Intermedia\n\nStart by creating a dedicated user account on Intermedia that has access to all the mailboxes you plan to migrate. This migration user needs the correct permissions to access each mailbox, ensuring a seamless data transfer.\n\nStep 2: Create an Account on BitTitan\n\nNext, sign up or log in to BitTitan at [MigrationWiz]\n\nMigrationWiz is BitTitan’s powerful, cloud-based migration tool that supports a wide range of data transfer needs, from mailboxes to documents and personal archives.\n\nStep 3: Set Up Your Project in BitTitan\n\nWithin the MigrationWiz dashboard, create a new migration project:\n\n1. Configure Source and Destination Settings\n\n– Source: Select ‘Exchange Server 2003+’ as your source type. You’ll need your Outlook Web Access (OWA) URL to ensure MigrationWiz can access the data on Intermedia.\n\n– Destination: Choose ‘Microsoft 365’ for the destination. Here, you’ll set up a dedicated migration account with administrative access in Microsoft 365.\n\n2. Gather Required Information\n\n– For the Microsoft 365 connection, you’ll need your **Application ID** and **Tenant ID**. These credentials link MigrationWiz to your Microsoft 365 environment, giving it the permissions needed for data migration.\n\nStep 4: Save and Review Your Project\n\nOnce the project is configured, save it and review the mailboxes that have been populated within MigrationWiz. Take a moment to ensure all intended mailboxes are listed to avoid any gaps in data transfer.\n\nStep 5: Prepare Microsoft 365 Accounts\n\nIn Microsoft 365, create users that match the Intermedia mailboxes and assign appropriate licenses. This setup prepares the destination environment to receive data from Intermedia. Without assigned licenses, users won’t have active mailboxes.\n\nStep 6: Verify Credentials\n\nWith users in place, run a “Verify Credentials” check within MigrationWiz to ensure all connections and permissions are working correctly. Once completed, you’ll know if any access or connection adjustments are needed.\n\nStep 7: Conduct a Trial Migration\n\nTo minimize risk, start with a trial migration. MigrationWiz allows you to migrate a small amount of data first, so you can identify and resolve any potential issues. This trial is essential for fine-tuning before the full migration.\n\nStep 8: Purchase BitTitan Licenses\n\nOnce you’re satisfied with the setup, purchase the appropriate BitTitan licenses. The number and type of licenses depend on your specific needs, and MoreMax can assist with selecting the right option to ensure cost-effectiveness.\n\nStep 9: Migration Roadmap\n\nAfter a successful connection test, follow this roadmap for the full migration:\n\n1. Pre-stage Migration for All Accounts\n\nA pre-stage migration will move most data initially, making the final cutover faster and easier for users. This phase is particularly useful for large mailboxes, as it reduces downtime when users switch to Microsoft 365.\n\n2. Change MX Records\n\nUpdate your MX records to direct new email traffic to Microsoft 365. This change is essential for a seamless cutover and ensures that incoming mail reaches the correct destination once users start using Microsoft 365 exclusively.\n\n3. Run the Full Migration\n\nComplete the migration by running the full transfer. Monitor for any errors and resolve them before rerunning migrations if necessary. This final step ensures all data has been transferred accurately, with no missing messages or disruptions.\n\nFollowing this step-by-step guide will help ensure a successful migration from Intermedia to Microsoft 365 using BitTitan’s MigrationWiz. Taking the time to set up correctly, test, and review each phase reduces risks and ensures a smooth experience for all users.\n\nYou are welcome to reach out if you need any help or have any questions.",
      "# [Idera Data Transfer Impact Assessment](https://www.ideracorp.com/Legal/Idera-Data-Transfer-Impact-Assessment)\nData Transfer Impact Assessment\n\nLast updated on May 08, 2024\n\nOverview:\n\nThe purpose of this document is to provide information to help Idera, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (a comprehensive list of Idera’s subsidiaries is available at https://www.ideracorp.com/brands (collectively, “the Company”) customers conduct data transfer impact assessments (TIA’s) for use of the Company’s products, based on the “Schrems II” ruling of the Court of Justice for the European Union and the recommendations from the European Data Protection Board.\n\nThis document describes the legal requirements and obligations applicable to the Company in the US, the safeguards the Company has put into place in regard to transfers of customer personal data from the European Economic Area, United Kingdom or Switzerland (\"Europe\"), and the Company’s ability to comply with its obligations as \"data importer\" under the Standard Contractual Clauses (\"SCCs\").\n\nFor more details about the Company’s GDPR compliance please visit this page.\n\nData Transfers\n\nWhere the Company processes personal data governed by European data protection laws as a data processor (on behalf of customers), the Company complies with the obligations under a Data Processing Addendum (\"DPA\") available via the link in the table below. The Company DPA incorporates the SCCs and includes the following information:\n\nIdera Affiliates Data Processing Terms, as defined in the DPA; and\n\nJurisdiction Specific Terms, as defined in the DPA (collectively, the “Exhibits”).\n\nWe may transfer customer personal data wherever we or our third-party service providers operate for the purpose of providing you the Services. The locations will depend on the particular Services you use, as outlined in the chart below.\n\nStandard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”)\n\nWhere personal data originating from the UK or Europe is transferred to the Company, the Company relies upon the SCCs implemented in 2021 to provide an appropriate safeguard for the transfer. To review a specific Company product’s Data Processing Addendum (which incorporates the SCCs) please refer to the applicable links in the table above in the column titled “Link to Idera, Inc. Affiliate’s DPA.”\n\nWhere customer personal data originating from the UK or Europe is transferred between Idera corporate group companies or transferred by the Company to third-party subprocessors, the Company enters into SCCs with those parties.\n\nU.S. Surveillance Laws\n\nFISA 702 and Executive Order 12333\n\nThe following US laws were identified by the Court of Justice of the European Union in Schrems II as being potential obstacles to ensuring essentially equivalent protection for personal data in the US:\n\nFISA Section 702 (“FISA 702”) – allows US government authorities to compel disclosure of information about non-US persons located outside the US for the purposes of foreign intelligence information gathering. This information gathering must be approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in Washington, DC. In-scope providers subject FISA 702 are electronic communication service providers (\"ECSP\") within the meaning of 50 U.S.C § 1881(b)(4), which can include remote computing service providers (\"RCSP\"), as defined under 18 U.S.C. § 2510 and 18 U.S.C. § 2711.\n\nExecutive Order 12333 (\"EO 12333\") - authorizes intelligence agencies (like the US National Security Agency) to conduct surveillance outside of the US. In particular, it provides authority for US intelligence agencies to collect foreign \"signals intelligence\" information, being information collected from communications and other data passed or accessible by radio, wire and other electromagnetic means. This may include accessing underwater cables carrying internet data in transit to the US. EO 12333 does not rely on the compelled assistance of service providers, but instead appears to rely on exploiting vulnerabilities in telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nFurther information about these US surveillance laws can be found in the U.S. Privacy Safeguards Relevant to SCCs and Other EU Legal Bases for EU-U.S.Data Transfers after Schrems II whitepaper from September 2020. This whitepaper details the limits and safeguards pertaining to US public authority access to data and was issued in response to the Schrems II ruling.\n\nRegarding FISA 702 the whitepaper notes:\n\nFor most companies, the concerns about national security access to company data highlighted by Schrems II are “unlikely to arise because the data they handle is of no interest to the U.S. intelligence community.” Companies handling “ordinary commercial information like employee, customer, or sales records, would have no basis to believe US intelligence agencies would seek to collect that data.”\n\nThere is individual redress, including for EU citizens, for violations of FISA section 702 through measures not addressed by the court in the Schrems II ruling, including FISA provisions allowing private actions for compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nRegarding Executive Order 12333 the whitepaper notes:\n\nEO 12333 does not on its own “authorize the U.S. government to require any company or person to disclose data.” Instead, EO 12333 must rely on a statute, such as FISA 702 to collect data.\n\nBulk data collection, the type of data collection at issue in Schrems II, is expressly prohibited under EO 12333.\n\nClOUD Act\n\nFor more information on the CLOUD Act, review What is the CLOUD Act? by BSA Software Alliance outlining the scope of the CLOUD Act.\n\nThe whitepaper notes:\n\nThe CLOUD Act only permits U.S. government access to data in criminal investigations after obtaining a warrant approved by an independent court based on probable cause of a specific criminal act.\n\nThe CLOUD Act does not allow U.S. government access in national security investigations, and it does not permit bulk surveillance.\n\nIs the Company subject to FISA 702 or EO 12333?\n\nThe Idera corporate group of companies, similar to most US-based SaaS companies, could technically be subject to FISA 702 where it is deemed to be a RCSP. However, the Company does not process personal data that is likely to be of interest to US intelligence agencies. Furthermore, the Company is not likely to be subject to upstream surveillance orders under FISA 702, the type of order principally addressed in, and deemed problematic by, the Schrems II decision. The Company does not provide internet backbone services, but instead only carries traffic involving its own customers. To date, the U.S. Government has interpreted and applied FISA 702 upstream orders to only target market providers that have traffic flowing through their internet backbone and that carry traffic for third parties (i.e., telecommunications carriers).\n\nIt is important to note that EO 12333 contains no authorization to compel private companies to disclose personal data to US authorities and FISA 702 requires an independent court to authorize a specific type of foreign intelligence data acquisition which is generally unrelated to commercial information. In the event that US intelligence agencies were interested in the type of data that the Company processes, safeguards such as the requirement for authorization by an independent court and the necessity and proportionality requirements would protect data from excessive surveillance.\n\nTo date, the Company has never received a US National Security Request (including requests for access under FISA 702 or direct access under EO 12333) in connection with customer personal data. Therefore, while the Company may technically be subject to the surveillance laws identified in Schrems II, we have not been subject to these types of requests in our day-to-day business operations. More information on how the Company processes data subject access requests is available in the applicable Universal Customer-Facing DPA in Section 4 “Rights of the Data Subjects,” and in the Jurisdiction Specific Terms document under Annex A, Section 3 “Applicability of Surveillance Laws to Idera.”\n\nTechnical, contractual and organizational measures applied to protect the transferred data\n\nThe Company utilizes many different vendors, tools, and processes to protect transferred data. Please refer to the applicable entity’s “Data Processing Terms” in the above table for a specific list of mechanisms.\n\nThe Company’s contractual measures are set out in our Data Processing Addendum which incorporates the SCCs. In particular, we are subject to the following requirements:\n\nTechnical measures: The Company is contractually obligated to have in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard personal data (both under the Data Processing Addendum as well as the SCCs we enter into with customers, service providers, and between entities with the Idera corporate group).\n\nTransparency: The Company is obligated under the SCCs to notify its customers in the event it is made subject to a request for government access to customer personal data from a government authority. In the event that the Company is legally prohibited from making such a disclosure, the Company is contractually obligated to challenge such prohibition and seek a waiver.\n\nActions to challenge access: Under the SCCs, the Company is obligated to review the legality of government authority access requests and challenge such requests where they are considered to be unlawful.\n\nOrganizational measures for securing customer data\n\nThe “Security and Risk Assessment Overview” document on the Company’s legal webpage under “Policies & Procedures” outlines the Company’s organizational measures for ensuring protection of customer data. Information regarding employee data privacy and protection training, data management, network and physical security, and many other measures can be found here. If you have a question regarding data protection that is not addressed in the documentation available on the Company’s legal webpage, please contact [email protected].\n\nImplementation of supplementary measures\n\nIn light of the information provided in this document, including the Company’s practical experience dealing with government requests and the technical, contractual, and organizational measures the Company has implemented to protect customer personal data, the Company considers that the risks involved in transferring and processing European personal data in/to the US do not impinge on our ability to comply with our obligations under the SCCs (as \"data importer\") or to ensure that individuals' rights remain protected. Therefore, no additional supplementary measures are necessary at this time. The Company will review and, if necessary, reconsider the risks involved and the measures it has implemented to address changing data privacy regulations and risk environments associated with transfers of personal data outside of Europe.",
