      "# [Secure Cloud Migration with BitTitan MigrationWiz on 2022-11-30](https://www.bittitan.com/security/)\nSecurity and Compliance\n\nAs an IT professional you need to be able to assure your clients that their data is secure at every step of the process—not just once it’s in the cloud. We take the security and compliance of your clients’ data very seriously.\n\nAt BitTitan, we take data security and privacy very seriously. Our product has been used to migrate Fortune 100 companies, American and foreign governments, police departments, banks, stock exchanges, telecoms, hospitals, and healthcare organizations – all with very stringent security requirements. Read the BitTitan Security Overview White Paper attached below for a more detailed view of our policies.\n\nISO Certifications\n\nISO 27001 – The world’s best-known standard for information security management systems (ISMS). ISO 27001 means BitTitan has put in place a system to manage cybersecurity risks that respects best practices and principles of the International Organization for Standardization.\n\nISO 27701 – Built to complement ISO 27001, this standard specifies requirements and provides guidance for a Privacy Information Management System (PIMS) for personal data. This framework allows you to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements including GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\n\nZero Deployment\n\nBitTitan products operate outside of the firewall and connect to messaging systems the same way any external user would. There is no need to install third-party software inside of your firewall or network.\n\nMailbox Data\n\nMailbox data (including subjects, bodies, attachments, etc.) are not stored on our servers. In some cases, the data may be cached temporarily in order to optimize network throughput. If cached, rest assured that your data is wiped immediately once that mailbox is done migrating.\n\nMailbox Credentials\n\nMailbox credentials are stored using military-grade AES encryption. The credentials are immediately purged from the system once you delete the corresponding configuration to which it is associated.\n\nAuto-Purge Policy\n\nWe have implemented an automatic purge policy that will delete any configuration that is not used. If no migration has been performed within 90 days (either of your last migration or creation of configuration, whichever is later), we will delete the data from our servers. You can configure this to be a longer or shorter period.\n\nData Centers\n\nBitTitan leverages Azure data centers, which are compliant with ISO/IEC 27001/27002:2013, SOC 1 Type 2 and SOC 2 Type 2, PCI DSS Level 1, FISMA, HIPAA/HITECH, CJIS, CSA CCM, FERPA and others. Customers can select from a variety of data center regions in which migrations will be processed. We offer data center locations in ​Australia, Europe, North America, Japan, South America, and Southeast Asia.",

      "# [Automate Everything by BitTitan Team on 2016-06-28](https://www.bittitan.com/blog/videos/automate-everything/)\n“As we grow and as we build upon this recurring business model and become more and more a managed service provider, we have to automate processes otherwise we won’t be able to handle larger volumes of customers and keep our customer service focus,” adds Mark Alexander of ISC.\n\nAs he so aptly summarizes, automation isn’t just about filling an immediate need but looking forward to the type of growth you anticipate in the future. The sheer volume of demands will always go up and your customers are going to solutions that help them stay up-to-speed while also not getting sidetracked from their end goal. A business without automation is sluggish and a pain for employees. Menial work that takes up hours of time and money can now be taken care of with a fraction of the stress and effort.\n\n“We don’t have people who are in charge of opening or closing projects anymore. We’ve essentially automated all of that,” says Chris Lehr of Strategic Projects & Services. “If I see something that’s going to take too long, we fix that problem.”\n\nMSPs, now more than ever, need to be prepared to solve these puzzles. Think of them as tech sudoku. The problem is right there in front of you, with the gaps waiting to be filled. That’s where automation comes in.",

The improvements:\n\nWe removed the 250MB item size limitation\n\nWe removed the 5,000 item count limitation for a single folder\n\nWe increased the overall throughput of OneDrive for Business migrations\n\nFiltering Users and Items by License Active is now possible in MigrationWiz. You’ll be able to see which Users/Items have licenses attached, and which don’t.\n\nWhat’s Fixed: We fixed some of the pesky bugs you may have run into.\n\nWe fixed issues with the MigrationWiz flyout panes, which were hard to view when the webpage is smaller.\n\nWe fixed the sort order of Users.\n\nThe “Join Teams Meeting” link will now carry over when migrating a calendar item from one Office 365 Tenant to another.\n\nMSPComplete\n\nNew Features\n\nNew Input Types for Input Request Tasks\n\nWe have added new input types which can be used when creating and executing Input Request Tasks. When editing Tasks, you can add these inputs to the Task by using the new Add Input menu.\n\nDropdown selection menu\n\nSelect Computers\n\nSelect Endpoints\n\nSelect Users\n\nSelect VMs\n\nAdd Multiple Inputs to Input Request Tasks\n\nNow you can collect multiple inputs on a single Input Request Task. When editing Tasks, you can add more inputs to the Task by selecting them from the Add Input You can drag and drop to set the order of these inputs in the Task.\n\nRemove Computers from the Customer Computers List\n\nWe have provided additional functionality to remove computers from the Computer tab in MSPComplete. This will remove computers that do not have DMA installed so that Users can better manage the list of computers. The Delete option is available when one or more Computers are selected in the list.\n\nImprovements\n\nStreamlined Runbook Launch Option\n\nWe have improved the launch options for Runbooks by adding the ability to immediately start a Runbook with default settings. In the Runbook Details panel, in addition to the existing Customer and Launch option, there is a now Launch option. Choosing this option starts the Runbook immediately, with the following default settings:\n\nAssignee is set to the Agent launching the Runbook\n\nDue date is set to midnight of the current day\n\nThese settings can always be edited by choosing the Edit Service Details option in the Actions menu.\n\nComputer List Filtering\n\nComputers can now be filtered by the status of the Device Management Agent running on the Computer.\n\nFixes\n\nWe have fixed inconsistencies in the behavior of drag and drop Task reordering in the Runbook Task list.\n\nWe have fixed a timeout error in launching the MSPComplete application. Previously, that error resulted in a perpetual loading state.\n\nRelease Notes: May 29\n\nMigrationWiz:\n\nUser Migration Bundle: We added UMB attach/detach into MigrationWiz. Now you can attach and detach UMB Licenses from inside your MigrationWiz projects. Simply select a group of Users, and select Attach UMB from the top toolbar.\n\nDeploymentPro:\n\nWe have heard you, and have updated the logic of the DeploymentPro status to make it easier for you to track and manage DeploymentPro projects.\n\nThe logic has changed.\n\nPreviously, the status of Scheduled meant that the date has been scheduled via the MSPComplete platform and was waiting for the Device Management Agent (DMA) to download and install DeploymentPro with the configured scheduled date.\n\nThe updated meaning of Scheduled is that DeploymentPro has been downloaded and configured based on the scheduled date and is waiting for the scheduled date to pass.\n\nPreviously, the status of Running meant that DeploymentPro had been downloaded and configured and was waiting for the scheduled date. The updated meaning of Running is that the scheduled date has passed and DeploymentPro is running and completing the switchover activities.\n\nNOTE: After scheduling the Cutover Date in the MSPComplete platform, it may take up to an hour for the Agent to switch over to Scheduled. This is because each Agent runs on a heartbeat cycle of up to an hour to pull down new instructions from the server.\n\nNotification on when DeploymentPro will install\n\nAfter scheduling DeploymentPro, it isn’t obvious when it will be installed on the target machine. We have implemented additional messaging to indicate when DeploymentPro will be installed.\n\nProduct Release Notes contain information about updates, upgrades and new features for BitTitan solutions and services.

If you send an email, you may get a reply  3-4 days later with weblinks that we have already read. \n\nHere is our issue. We have no problem creating the Project in BitTitan for GSuite email to Office 365 migration. It works as advertised. \n\nIf we create a New Project  for Documents (GDrive to OneDrive), we do not have an option to select Google Drive (Own Service Account), upload a JSON file and enter Super Admin credentials. We can only select Google Drive, then One Drive (Destination) and Advanced Options. Because of this, it will fail validation.\n\nThanks in advance\n\n## Comment ID i77g43s with +16 score by [(yothhedgedigger, Reddit, 2022-05-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/uhp9r0/bittitan_support_is_a_mess_need_insight_on/i77g43s/) (in reply to ID uhp9r0):\nI'm sorry I don't have an answer, but I did want to confirm that support is almost nonexistent there now.

Single domain, exchange mailboxes to a new 365 tenant for example, almost 100% self serve via their portal, not likely to be an issue. Had horrendous experiences with more complex scenarios though (tenant to tenant, multi domain mailboxes) Support was there, they just could not grasp the more complex problems and the portal quickly falls apart and requires days of them background tinkering to have any chance of success.\nFor mailbox data I am currently using codetwo. \nFor other data consider move.io or SharePoint migration tool.\n\n#### Comment ID i7817fh with +1 score by [(DiskRaider, Reddit, 2022-05-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/uhp9r0/bittitan_support_is_a_mess_need_insight_on/i7817fh/) (in reply to ID i77wpm5):\nThe project I am currently working is mostly mailboxes and some onenote stuff but it's cross tenant (GoDaddy M365 to Microsoft M365).

      "# Post ID 5r7lcv: Burned by BitTitan, need new ideas for O365 Migrations with +10 score by [(tommucha, Reddit, 2017-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5r7lcv/burned_by_bittitan_need_new_ideas_for_o365/)\n**TL;DR - DeploymentPro is broken on the back end, what else do people use for Outlook profile migrations, either standalone or a full migration product?**\n\nWe've used SkyKick before and for more than double the price of BitTitan, I wasn't happy with what it does.  Any other 3rd party tools out there that at least can do Outlook profile migrations?  I'm going to look more into the minimal hybrid option and use MRS moves, but documentation is very limited on the new minimal hybrid so I need to lab it out with some MS Partner hours to help.  While the minimal hybrid may be my answer, it won't be a fit for all projects.  \n.\n\nThe story below:\n\nWe've used the BitTitan family of products for 20 or so Office 365 migrations so we're fairly comfortable with the software. On our last project, DeploymentPro left us standing there with having to manually configure 100 Outlook profiles.  If you don't know what DeploymentPro is, it reconfigures Outlook profiles on the desktop, saving lots of time in a migration.\n\nYesterday was cutover day.  MigrationWiz worked fine, but DeploymentPro was throwing errors on the client side and the management website.  Check the status page - Degraded Performance for DeploymentPro with no other details.\n\nWith no phone number to call to talk to a person, we start a chat.  Can't help in chat, someone will followup in 24-48hrs.  After letting that soak in, we shelled out the $250  to get someone on the phone only to find out there is a known issue with the SQL server used for DepoymentPro losing connectivity/going offline and there is no ETA on the fix.  If it's not back up, they'll refund the money for DeploymentPro, and hopefully the $250 premium support.  I'm not going to rant about the practice of leaving something that's broken in production, that's reserved for a cold beer at the pub.\n\nSo now its a mad rush to configure 100 PCs over 3 locations.  It happens, suck it up and get the job done.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID dd5uxnt with +10 score by [(bittitansupport, Reddit, 2017-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5r7lcv/burned_by_bittitan_need_new_ideas_for_o365/dd5uxnt/) (in reply to ID 5r7lcv):\nHi Tom, Dominic with BitTitan Support.\n\nFirst of all, I'm terribly sorry you had a bad experience using DeploymentPro and had to manually reconfigure ~100 desktops.\n\nYour money will be 100% promptly refunded. Regarding premium phone support licenses, we always refund those if the issue is on our end of things (which is the case here).\n\nOur investigation showed the following:\n\t1. You are using the legacy version of Deployment Pro (https://community.bittitan.com/partners/Pages/Partner%20Portal/Miscellaneous/DeploymentPro.aspx).\n\t2. We recommend switching to the new version for future projects (http://blog.bittitan.com/preview-snazzy-new-deploymentpro) - see benefits.\n\t3. We acknowledge and understand the root cause of the issue you experienced. It is related to a Microsoft SQL performance issue. We've contacted the vendor (Microsoft) and posted a notification as soon as we were aware of the issue (http://status.bittitan.com).\n\nIn addition to your full refund, we've also deposited 25 free Deployment Pro licenses to your account.\n\nAgain, we're sorry about the inconvenience and are confident you will have an improved experience using new version of Deployment Pro.\n\n### Comment ID dd6bst3 with +2 score by [(emeffinsteve, Reddit, 2017-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5r7lcv/burned_by_bittitan_need_new_ideas_for_o365/dd6bst3/) (in reply to ID dd5uxnt):\nI've got a potential project migrating 14 mailboxes from one Office 365 account to another.

As I've said in my post, we've used you guys for a bunch of deployments and BitTitan has been our go to.  We're not big fish in the sea of email migrations, so a response like this is a nice touch.  \n\nI'll be honest that this is the first time I've heard of a new version of DeploymentPro and that we're using a legacy version.  We would setup DP through the portal after getting the MigrationWiz project configured,  and when I just ran through it, I saw no mention of this being a legacy version.  I'll review the links you've provided and review the steps with the team to make sure this doesn't happen again.  \n\nWhen we go kick off migrations, we normally don't go checking the status pages to make sure everything is in the green,  I'll be adding that to our checklist.

I don't remember the error/ issue but DP completely failed even though it worked for my previous tests. (I will find the support ticket today and share it). I contacted them right away via chat. They said 1-2 day response. No good. I bought a premium support ticket and someone called me in about 1.5 hours. They looked at it and said \"I see there is an issue with our server.\" They didnt have an ETA though. So I contacted the client and pushed migration by a week. Ugh. HOPING DP would be working.

It was for the new version using DMA, not the legacy one. I was migrating 300 users from Exchange hosted to Office 365. Testing on a couple of machines went perfectly.\n\nFirst, the DMA agent used up all of the available drive space on every workstation. The agent had a bug that kept generating new log files. That was a major problem that we had to deal with. I called BitTitan support and they told us to delete the log files and told me they were knew about the bug and were working on an update that would get automatically pushed down to the workstations when it was available.\n\nSecond, the new updated DMA agent that BitTitan released that night to fix the bug, was never reporting back to the BitTitan DMA servers. We had no idea because you have to look in a different area of the portal to see this info. The DeploymentPro console showed the agent successfully installed but under they only show the last heartbeat received under the DMA console. Very confusing and unintuitive interface.\n\nThird, we had a made a change to the naming convention for our Office 365 users after this MigrationWiz/BitTitan project was created. Support showed me how to change the destination address in the DeploymentPro console for each user, manually. But when you made the change it was never reflected in the console. It continues to show the previous name. Support told me that is a bug in the interface but he was sure thru his testing that the backend was successfully updated. And because it did not reflect the proper destination name after making the change, I had to schedule the agent to run instead of kicking it off when I was ready. Not ideal in this situation.\n\nNo fast forward a couple of days to the day of the cutover and all of these bugs made for the perfect storm for my customer. The schedule never started on half of the machines and on the other half the agent would hang and never continue. We had about an 80% failure rate.\n\nIt turns out that the new updated agent never checked in to the BitTitan servers so it never received the updated destination name or the schedule that I set. Support said we would have to wait 24 hours for a call back. I checked with support again an hour later when we were getting no where with our efforts to get Outlook working again. I was told this time that we could pay $250 for priority phone support. By the time we got support we needed and got to the root of the problem it was too little, too late. The whole day was shot. We got everyone back online after visiting most workstations but many of them did not get their nickname cache or their rules migrated over.\n\nI believe the customer was able to get a refund from BitTitan for DeploymentPro but the product really killed us and I would not feel comfortable using it again in the future.\n\n### Comment ID dd9f8fa with +2 score by [(tommucha, Reddit, 2017-02-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5r7lcv/burned_by_bittitan_need_new_ideas_for_o365/dd9f8fa/) (in reply to ID dd8tksx):\nWow that doesn't sound like a good time, thanks for sharing your story.

Friends of mine have used Skykick and love it but it is more expensive. Skykick does everything for you. It is especially good for an Office 365 tenant to tenant migration because it will deprovision the domain from the old tenant and add it to the new tenant for you.

      "# Post ID 1ebzo7d: BitTitan/MigrationWiz is broken; no public comment and no refund. with +30 score by [(L0ngpants, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ebzo7d/bittitanmigrationwiz_is_broken_no_public_comment/)\nIn the same vein as Intel's recent behavior being hush-hush about defects until public backlash, BitTitan is covering up massive problems with their Gmail API integration.\n\nEDIT: for clarity, Google Workspace is the destination in this case. It is a Workspace->Workspace migration.\n\nI had to fight tooth-and-nail to force them to investigate far enough to recognize the issue is on their end. They admitted it was their problem and their dev team was engaged in working on a fix, but that has gone on for 60 days now. Despite insisting several times, they refuse to provide any timeline.\n\nHere are the main points underlining their unacceptable response to this issue:\n\n1. They flippantly suggest switching to imap, but \"note that this will duplicate content\". They're joking, right? They know that clients won't be happy with this and a massive amount of effort will go into cleaning out the old content to start fresh.\n2. They're dragging their feet and taking no responsibility. Any org worth their salt would have proactively offered a refund before we reached 60 days of no resolution.\n3. They refuse a refund. The \"Technical Support Manager for US Region\" (and now the \"head of support for the whole org\") themselves stated \"refunding the license is not possible because I could see that you have already migrated some data\". Can't make this stuff up, folks.\n4. Licenses are still on sale, with no warning posted on product page; no warning at checkout; no warning during project setup; no warning on blog, website, support site, or status dashboard. They do not care that their product is broken, and that many others will spin up projects only to get half way through before discovering this disaster; I'm sure they will be refused refunds, as well.\n\nIt has been a long time coming with MigrationWiz, but I think this is the last straw. I cannot in good faith ever recommend this product again. It has consistently gone down-hill year after year.\n\nAMA, leave your condolences, or let me know what alternatives you're liking better. I'm going to be trying AvePoint Fly shortly. It's going to be an annoying few weeks while I clean this mess up.\n\nUPDATE: supposedly my ticket made it to the head of support across the whole org. Still refusing refund. Apologized for the frustration but still offered no timeline or commitment to resolution. Offered me 2x the licenses in lieu of the refund... totally tone deaf. What am I going to do with free licenses for a product I can't trust?\n\n  \nUPDATE 2: they replied to my ticket to let me know that a status message is now posted on their status dashboard here [https://status.bittitan.com/](https://status.bittitan.com/) . Unfortunately, they knew about this issue for at least 60 days but have only begun showing this message now. I can confirm that I checked this status page prior to writing this post.\n\n## Comment ID lewbh8u with +27 score by [(BawdyLotion, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ebzo7d/bittitanmigrationwiz_is_broken_no_public_comment/lewbh8u/) (in reply to ID 1ebzo7d):\nSorry it's my fault.\n\nEvery time I've used BitTitan they have an outage the day I go to use it.\n\nI had the start of a gsuite to 365 migration meeting scheduled literally 5 minutes from now that I was planning to use BitTitan for.

I did a prestage migration for everything up to 30 days, and on the day of final migration. I ran the final migration multiple times to be safe. However, recently I had one user complain that his entire 2020 year of his calendar was missing. I reported this to MigrationWiz, who recommended I reset statistics and run a full migration again. This time, it found more than 6000 items that were missed the first time. So, I reset statistics again, and ran it again, and it found hundreds of items missed. I had zero errors. I would not recommend anyone use this product ever again.\n\nI spent about 2 weeks recently writing a program using AI that helps me migrate mail using Graph API and I have successfully tested it on some test mailboxes. I am not experienced enough to use it for any production environments, but I would love it if someone with actual programming skills can make some competition here. I definitely cannot use an app that is moving hundreds of thousands of emails, and will miss things.\n\nAlso, their documentation is bad. I saw someone saying they have good documentation, but it is definitely not good. I have been in IT for 20 years and was an Exchange tier 7 for many years. I liked the convenience of something like MigrationWiz, but when the mailboxes appear to be the same on both sides, only missing a handful of items in each mailbox, what exactly am I supposed to do when the scan says all the files are the same? I trusted the system too much and became complacent! I should have checked the actual number of items, but some of my these users have hundreds of folders, which is wild to say the least.\n\n## Comment ID lewuwca with +1 score by [(djweis, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ebzo7d/bittitanmigrationwiz_is_broken_no_public_comment/lewuwca/) (in reply to ID 1ebzo7d):\nI figured out the built in 365 migration tool and moved a customer over in the time it took for BitTitan support to reply to a similar issue I was having.\n\n## Comment ID lewxceo with +1 score by [(PEBKAC-Live, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ebzo7d/bittitanmigrationwiz_is_broken_no_public_comment/lewxceo/) (in reply to ID 1ebzo7d):\nWell this is very interesting, I have just sent an email to them today requesting a refund for a failed GSuite to SharePoint migration.\n\n\nOur engineer has been battling with as their support as it has taken 2 weeks for 300Gb of data to migrate.\n\n\nYet we have cancelled and manually migrated the data and did 300gb in a day.\n\n\nI got involved today as our client was hugely unhappy with how long it is taking, so have now asked for a full refund.\n\n### Comment ID lewzty4 with +1 score by [(L0ngpants, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ebzo7d/bittitanmigrationwiz_is_broken_no_public_comment/lewzty4/) (in reply to ID lewxceo):\nGood luck, I'd love to hear what the result is...\n\nMy issue was Gmail-specific but based on how they handled this, I would not be surprised if their whole system is held together with duct tape and bubblegum.\n\n#### Comment ID lfgiaxs with +1 score by [(PEBKAC-Live, Reddit, 2024-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ebzo7d/bittitanmigrationwiz_is_broken_no_public_comment/lfgiaxs/) (in reply to ID lewzty4):\nWe got an email Friday night asking for a Teams meeting on Monday.

Lack of other good options?\n\nJust got done with our first migration, here's my thoughts:\n\n\\- Support is crap. Due to the nature of these migrations, if I have an issue, I need the ability to call in immediately.  It can't wait 24hrs for a response.  I'd take chat support at the very least for a mid migration emergency.  Come on...\n\n\\- The sheer amount of pre-requs is nuts.  This should be part of the license!  Whyyyyy can't they script these changes and do them for you (with approval of course)! Plus, change them all back for me after!  Why make my life so hard?\n\n\\- No modern auth option? Really? it's 2023 ladies and gents...\n\nJust my 2 cents, but we purchased this licensing to make our life easier! I've never had so many \"BUT WHY\" moments using a modern piece of software.  Granted, it was our first migration and i understand the necessity for them now, BUT allllll of them could have been part of the tool!\n\nPleasssse change my mind and tell me there's an easier way to use the software!!\n\nBitTitan, if you're listening, please fix this stuff! If I'm going from Google Workspace to O365, give me an object-based selection system!  Example: Using modern auth, I found all this crap in Google Workspace! Wanna move it? Cool, where to!?  <--See! Soooo easy :)\n\nedit: to be fair, I should add that it all worked! but did it save me time.... probably a little? could i have done everything manually in roughly the same time (15 mailboxes), probably-ish. Plus the licensing cost compared to free...\n\n## Comment ID jun9wu4 with +32 score by [(WizardOfGunMonkeys, Reddit, 2023-08-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/15h9ppz/bittitan_thoughts/jun9wu4/) (in reply to ID 15h9ppz):\nIt's weird to use.

It would be nice if the product is refined a bit more.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat being said, you'll find the answer to why people keep coming back, is that despite the slower support and annoying prerequisites, *the software just works*. \n\n(there is paid support for emergencies but it shouldn't be necessary if you are able to plan out the migration. I say if you are able to, because I'm no stranger to Sales promising the moon, and then expecting Support to figure things out)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt also saves you a lot of time from manually verifying things. Moving 5-10 mailboxes is not a big problem. \n\nWhen you have 100+ mailboxes with some users crossing 100+GB in mailbox sizes, and none of them have any archiving enabled, that's when you thank the tech gods that something like BT exists. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt may be clunky, but so far it's always gotten the job done.\n\n### Comment ID juoljqv with +1 score by [(JayOutOfContext, Reddit, 2023-08-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/15h9ppz/bittitan_thoughts/juoljqv/) (in reply to ID junkzga):\nThis really is my favorite comment here.

But to be honest, it was way easier to deploy and migrate with BitTitan than when I had support with Quest.\n\nI had no issues with the Gsuite to O365 migration I did for a customer.  It went super smooth.  I'm \"certified\" to do migrations with Quest as well which can do 4000 different things, but it's cumbersome, their documentation is horrible (the lab the make you take has a video to go along with it, that video just stops once you get to like step 17) and it's more expensive.\n\nThe documentation was amazing on BitTitan IMO, I went step by step and it couldn't have been any easier.  It's not really a great tool for complex migrations but basic Gsuite to 365 with Google Drives containing less than 100GB of Data is pretty straight forward.\n\nIf you have 15 mailboxes it well could have been faster to do it manually with a tool, but that's on you to figure out not the tool.  The tools are great for large migrations, but if you have the bandwidth to babysit everything through Microsoft's tools just do that.  You have to do the pre-req's not matter what tool you buy, you're allowing a 3rd party app to gain explicit API access to your tenants, it's going to take time.  From what I remember the last time I did it, there was something to accommodate modern auth, it was in a separate sub guide or it was in the works.\n\n## Comment ID junzulm with +2 score by [(der_klee, Reddit, 2023-08-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/15h9ppz/bittitan_thoughts/junzulm/) (in reply to ID 15h9ppz):\nFor Exchange to Exchange Online or Cross-Forest Exchange Migrations I use CodeTwo and it works great.

I did a prestage migration for everything up to 30 days, and on the day of final migration. I ran the final migration multiple times to be safe. However, recently I had one user complain that his entire 2020 year of his calendar was missing. I reported this to MigrationWiz, who recommended I reset statistics and run a full migration again. This time, it found more than 6000 items that were missed the first time. So, I reset statistics again, and ran it again, and it found hundreds of items missed. I had zero errors. I would not recommend anyone use this product ever again.\n\nI spent about 2 weeks recently writing a program using AI that helps me migrate mail using Graph API and I have successfully tested it on some test mailboxes. I am not experienced enough to use it for any production environments, but I would love it if someone with actual programming skills can make some competition here. I definitely cannot use an app that is moving hundreds of thousands of emails, and will miss things.\n\nAlso, their documentation is bad. I saw someone saying they have good documentation, but it is definitely not good. I have been in IT for 20 years and was an Exchange tier 7 for many years. I liked the convenience of something like MigrationWiz, but when the mailboxes appear to be the same on both sides, only missing a handful of items in each mailbox, what exactly am I supposed to do when the scan says all the files are the same? I trusted the system too much and became complacent! I should have checked the actual number of items, but some of my these users have hundreds of folders, which is wild to say the least.\n\n## Comment ID lljztby with +1 score by [(Tech_saviy, Reddit, 2024-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1d80w5s/dont_use_bittitan_migrationwiz_any_other_good/lljztby/) (in reply to ID 1d80w5s):\nThey have a lot of good videos.

It's what we did and we do one a week or so. Product works fine if you don't need support (as in have the process worked out).",
      "# Post ID twqa1c: It BitTitan's Support always incompetent? Or am I just unlucky? (Is there any point in waiting for them to actually read my ticket?) with +10 score by [(RipRapRob, Reddit, 2022-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/twqa1c/it_bittitans_support_always_incompetent_or_am_i/)\nSo, briefly:\n\nHad to migrate a Customer from G Suite to M365. Their shared files was on a single users Google Drive which I then had to migrate to Teams/SharePoint.\n\nWhen I tried to specify the URL of the SharePoint-site I wanted the files migrated to, I discovered that BitTitan instead created a folder on their their 'Default' SharePoint Site with the name of the URL I specified. I tried several times, and could only migrate to that same Default SharePoint site, no matter how I tried to specify a different SharePoint Site.\n\nBitTitan's documentation and the GUI does not match, so I decided to make a Ticket since I'm going to do a similar migration for another Customer shortly. \n\n\nThe headline of my ticket: \"Unable to migrate to SPECIFIC SharePoint-site\" and I was careful to describe my failed attempts, relevant URLs etc.\n\n\nSince I had a deadline on the first migration project I decided to complete the migration via the 'detour' over the Default SharePoint Site: Google Drive >>> Default Site (using BitTitan) >>> Move files to correct SharePoint Sites.\n\n\nAfter a week BitTitan told me, they would close the Ticket: \"I checked your project above and am glad to see that your item has migrated successfully now.\". \n\nI told them not to close my ticket: Yes, I had made my migration, BUT NOT TO THE SITE I WANTED TO MIGRATE TO. Would they please read the ticket, since I have another migration coming up.\n\nAnother week passed, I now I've gotten an answer starting with:\n\n\"**Issue: Cannot migrate /GoogleDrive/[Customer Name]/[Folder name]//[Folder name]//[Folder name]/[Filename].jpg, item does not have solid file content.\"\n\nThey went to the fucking logs, found an error there, and addressed THAT error (an error I never mentioned in my ticket, since that's not my main problem - it's just a single file) INSTEAD of my main problem.\n\nSo: Anyone have any good experience with BitTitan support? \n\nShould I use another product instead, when migrating files from G Suite to M365?\n\n**EDIT - UPDATE:**\n\nEnded up ditching BitTitan for my next project because of this (and will do my best to avoid BitTitan in the future).\n\nI had looked into using Mover.io, but failed to get it working. Ended up using Microsoft's own Migration Tool - https://[redacted]-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/online/AdminHome.aspx#/migration instead (this might include Mover.io tech?), and it worked like a charm.\n\n## Comment ID i3gva42 with +12 score by [(DheeradjS, Reddit, 2022-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/twqa1c/it_bittitans_support_always_incompetent_or_am_i/i3gva42/) (in reply to ID twqa1c):\nBitTitan is our poison of choice when migrating client email. \n\nThere has been a very noticable decline in their quality, both the product and support, nosediving since they got bought out by Idera.

This may be a result of a large number of files, total size of files, depth of folder structure, etc. \n\nWhen you exceed this limit, the copy stops, and the Web UI shows that the job is complete and 100% successful. Subsequent updates fail silently, with no error in the Web UI.\n\nThe only way to discover that you have exceeded this limit is if you have exported the unpublished detail log to an SQL target. Or to check the stats between the old and new sites.\n\nThis means that you may have thousands of files that fail copy or fail to update after your final sync.\n\n**NONE OF THIS IS DOCUMENTED**\n\nTHERE IS NO WARNING\n\nIf you do use BitTitan, be sure to check your site item counts and document size totals to make sure you have copied everything\n\n## Comment ID i3hh2qs with +3 score by [(ekix, Reddit, 2022-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/twqa1c/it_bittitans_support_always_incompetent_or_am_i/i3hh2qs/) (in reply to ID twqa1c):\nI can recommend the built-in Sharepoint Migration Tool it works great for G-suite.\n\nHowever I always prefer to use BitTitan or Skykick when migrating mail.\n\n### Comment ID i3hr4ac with +1 score by [(RipRapRob, Reddit, 2022-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/twqa1c/it_bittitans_support_always_incompetent_or_am_i/i3hr4ac/) (in reply to ID i3hh2qs):\nWe use this all the time, when migrating from a server, but I don't think it supports migrating directly from Google Drive?\n\n#### Comment ID i3j1vhq with +1 score by [(Nordon, Reddit, 2022-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/twqa1c/it_bittitans_support_always_incompetent_or_am_i/i3j1vhq/) (in reply to ID i3hr4ac):\nIt does!

They list GDrive, Box, Dropbox, Egnyte, Amazon S3, and Google Cloud Storage, amongst others, as sources for transfer. The destination, however, is only a Microsoft-owned one (after all, Microsoft bought this product for a reason).\n\nI honestly cannot recall if the cost is included in your SharePoint subscription, but it is a useful tool.\n\nBitTitan support does suck eggs, though. I did a move over a weekend, and opened a case with high priority on the Friday night at the start of the migration. Crickets.\n\nEnded up resolving / working around the issue on our own. It wasn't until the Tuesday *after* the move when we heard the *first* response from them over email. Maybe there's a paid support option that gets you help faster but this is bordering on ridiculous.\n\nMost of my mail migrations are Exchange Online to Exchange Online, so I'm planning on playing around with the built in migration tools there. They aren't as elegant or simple to use, but I know that I can get faster support for them.\n\n## Comment ID i3kusfg with +2 score by [(chedstrom, Reddit, 2022-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/twqa1c/it_bittitans_support_always_incompetent_or_am_i/i3kusfg/) (in reply to ID twqa1c):\nBitTitan was purcahsed  by a private equity firm last fall.

The CEO is determined and single minded but lacks any leadership instincts or abilities.  He blamed his developers for the failure of his incubation product MSPC even though he would not let the idea fail fast and die after there was no demand. As soon as someone left the company the CEO would waste no time in telling as many current employees as he could that the former employee did not know what they were doing or didn't do something right. Not very professional and not behaviour fitting of someone in the CEO position, let alone any management position.\r\n- Lacks emotional intelligence. Cannot keep his cool or help but yell when he gets upset, which is much of the time. Does not listen, but merely tells so any meeting with the CEO becomes a painful listening experience for you and one in which an actual conversation does not occur. \r\n- Clearly narcissistic. I think he believes he truly knows everything about everything and if he could, he would fire everyone in the company and go back to being a company of one employee.\r\n- Has majority vote in the company",

If the company made a mistake terminating your employment, we're confident you will move on to greener pastures (versus spending your spare time posting the same thing over and over again).\r\n\r\nSecond, regarding the fact that &lt;1% of employees are family members of our CEO, it is factually true. However, I am confident that any employee would take offense to the accusation of nepotism. If anything, those 2 people are held to a higher standard, and are well recognized as some of the hardest working employees in the company. I'm sorry, but it's not like building maintenance is a glamorous position!\r\n\r\nFor the record, those are the same people who, when BitTitan was a 4 person company, volunteered their personal time to help paint the walls... Those folks certainly \"don't enjoy or deserve to be degraded and humiliated when they work hard\" (see advice to management above).\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

The CEO is determined and single minded but lacks any leadership instincts or abilities.  He blamed his developers for the failure of his incubation product MSPC even though he would not let the idea fail fast and die after there was no demand. As soon as someone left the company the CEO would waste no time in telling as many current employees as he could that the former employee did not know what they were doing or didn't do something right. Not very professional and not behaviour fitting of someone in the CEO position, let alone any management position.\r\n- Lacks emotional intelligence. Cannot keep his cool or help but yell when he gets upset, which is much of the time. Does not listen, but merely tells so any meeting with the CEO becomes a painful listening experience for you and one in which an actual conversation does not occur. \r\n- Clearly narcissistic.

This award celebrates BitTitan as one of the best and brightest industry products and reinforces its dedication to simplifying the complexities of data migrations, enabling companies across industries to seamlessly adapt to the ever-evolving technological landscape.\n\n“BitTitan’s MigrationWiz is a standout solution in the cloud services industry, offering a comprehensive, automated approach to data and workload migration across various cloud platforms,” said Annabelle Whittall, lead judge of the SaaS Awards. “Its platform-agnostic design, user-friendly interface, and advanced features like real-time monitoring and scheduling make it an invaluable tool for businesses undergoing digital transformation. By minimizing disruptions and reducing the complexity of cloud migrations, MigrationWiz empowers organizations to seamlessly transition to the cloud, making BitTitan a deserving recipient of this 2024 SaaS Award.”\n\nA long-established awards program spanning 56 categories, the SaaS Awards recognize the leading innovations and applications of software-as-a-service solutions across a wide range of use cases and sectors. The program received entries from organizations of varying sizes from across the globe.\n\n“We are honored to receive the Best SaaS Product for IT Management award,” said Aaron Wadsworth, general manager at BitTitan. “This recognition reflects our team’s relentless dedication to providing innovative solutions that empower IT professionals worldwide. At BitTitan, we remain committed to addressing the challenges of migrating data and workloads between various cloud environments efficiently and securely.

In April 2024, the company launched its new Active Directory (AD) migration capabilities for MigrationWiz, which enable users to migrate AD objects from one on-premises environment to another without the need for a network connection. The new AD tool provides an easy way to copy user and group objects from a source AD to a target AD, with the purpose of provisioning these objects in a Microsoft 365 tenant.",
      "# [BitTitan Launches MigrationWiz Active Directory Migration Solution by Ankur Garg on 2024-04-02](https://get.bittitan.com/blog/bittitan-news/bittitan-launches-migrationwiz-active-directory-migration-solution/)\nThe new migration feature enables end users to transfer identities and organizational unit structures from one AD environment to another\n\nAUSTIN, Texas – April 2, 2024 – BitTitan, the global leader in managed services automation, today announced the launch of its Active Directory (AD) migration tool for MigrationWiz. The new solution simplifies end users’ ability to transfer identities and organizational unit (OU) structures, including user accounts, groups, and other related objects, from one AD environment to another. This new feature allows IT professionals to not only migrate AD objects, but also easily transition to other workload migrations such as mailboxes or shared files for easier migrations and greater data fidelity.\n\nWith no disruption in work or access during the migration process, end users can now automate migrations within MigrationWiz for a continuous transition of AD data and configurations to a new or existing on-premises AD environment, setting the stage for synchronization to Entra ID, formally known as Azure AD.\n\nAs a cost-effective solution compared to manual migration processes, the MigrationWiz AD migration tool offers minimal downtime so users can access their data as soon as possible. In addition, it provides a seamless migration process that preserves data integrity while reducing the need for manual intervention and reduces the risks of errors.\n\n“When it comes to our migration needs, we need a tool that is reliable, efficient, and practical,” said Mark Rochester, Cloud Architect, The Cloud Geezer YouTube Channel, and Industry Expert. “This new functionality significantly automates the Active Directory migration process for our customers, enabling us to easily provision everything we need for the migration to the new destination. With this new AD migration tool, we can execute even more migrations effectively, helping to meet our business goals and improve user experience for our IT teams.”\n\nMigrationWiz’s new Active Directory migration solution offers several features and capabilities to end users, including:\n\nAutomatic discovery and migration of AD objects, including users, groups, and sub-OUs.\n\nPassword synchronization between the old and new AD environments for a seamless user experience.\n\nReal-time progress tracking that allows administrators to monitor migration status and identify issues or errors.\n\nAdvanced mapping and filtering for administrators to map source and target AD objects and filter out unwanted data.\n\nIntegration with other MigrationWiz tools that migrate Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive for a comprehensive migration solution. Users migrated through the tool are automatically set up for a mailbox or document project if needed.\n\n“As mergers, acquisitions, and cloud consolidation persist, the demand for migration solutions continues to grow, compelling companies to seek reliable tools to effortlessly streamline these processes and accommodate diverse migration needs,” said Shane Daugherty, Manager, Technical Services Specialist Team at BitTitan. “Our new advanced solution enables IT professionals to complete Active Directory migrations without headaches or stress. MigrationWiz AD Migration provides the ability to complete Microsoft 365 migration projects with one single tool, automating the process while improving end results and user experience.”\n\nThe Active Directory migration license is priced per user and is an efficient first step to migrating mailboxes and OneDrive with BitTitan’s User Migration Bundle (UMB).

I am trying to migrate a handful of users from an M365 tenant with a custom domain, to another M365 tenant without a custom domain. After migration we'll release the domain from tenant A and pick it up in tenant B. In other words, we want to keep the domain from the source and apply it to the target. I am getting errors with BitTitan setting up the project.\n\nIt is a generic error that tells me to contact support, which I did and opened a ticket. While I'm waiting, wanted to see if the community has any experience with this type of migration. I see a warning in the application settings in Azure and wondered if it's relevant. Does anyone know if BitTitan MigrationWiz works with onmicrosoft.com email domain (no MPN ID)?\n\nThe BitTitan error.\n\nMany thanks for sharing any experience you have in this topic.",

      "# [Cross Tenant Microsoft 365 Migration by Uzair Amir, www.facebook.com, AsevenX.foREVer on 2024-03-21](https://hackread.com/cross-tenant-microsoft-365-migration/)\nWhat is a Cross Tenant migration, and why and when do you need it? Cross-tenant migration refers to the process of moving data, applications, and services from one Microsoft 365 tenant (or organization) to another. Whether due to mergers, acquisitions, restructuring, or strategic decisions, businesses often find themselves in situations where they need to consolidate or reorganize their tenant structures.\n\nThe different actors\n\nWhen it comes to tenant-to-tenant migration within Microsoft 365, several key actors play crucial roles in ensuring a successful transition. Let’s explore them:\n\nMicrosoft Consulting Services (MCS): Organizations often collaborate with MCS to plan and execute tenant migrations. Their expertise ensures a smooth transition, addressing complexities and minimizing disruptions1.\n\nMicrosoft Partners: These skilled professionals specialize in tenant migrations. They work closely with organizations, offering tailored solutions and leveraging third-party tools for content migration1.\n\nIT Administrators: Within the organization, IT administrators take charge of technical aspects. They oversee user accounts, data integrity, and configuration adjustments during the migration process.\n\nIdentity Architects: These architects design the identity framework for the new tenant. They handle user authentication, access permissions, and identity synchronization across tenants.\n\nData Migration Specialists: These experts focus on moving data—emails, files, SharePoint sites—from the source to the target tenant. They ensure data fidelity and minimal downtime.\n\nChange Management Teams: Communication is key. Change management teams inform stakeholders about the migration, manage expectations, and guide users through the transition.\n\nThe different solutions: When it comes to cross-tenant Microsoft 365 migrations, several vendors and solutions can assist you in smoothly transitioning your users’ data. Here are some options:\n\nMicrosoft 365 Native Tools: Microsoft provides native tools and interfaces for cross-tenant mailbox and OneDrive migrations.\n\nThird-Party Migration Solutions: Several third-party vendors offer specialized migration tools for Microsoft 365 cross-tenant scenarios. These solutions provide additional features, flexibility, and support.\n\nSome popular vendors include:\n\nCloudiway:\n\nCloudiway specializes in cloud migration services, including Microsoft 365. Their platform is one of the most complete solutions and supports Microsoft cross-tenant migrations for mailboxes, OneDrive, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, Intune and devices. Cloudiway emphasizes ease of use and efficient migration processes.\n\nAvePoint:\n\nAvePoint offers migration solutions for Microsoft 365, including cross-tenant scenarios. Their tools provide features like Mailbox, OneDrive, Microsoft Teams and SharePoint migrations. AvePoint’s solutions are known for their reliability and comprehensive support.\n\nBitTitan:\n\nBitTitan is known for its MigrationWiz tool, which supports cross-tenant migrations for mailboxes, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams.\n\nQuest:\n\nOffers solutions like Quest On Demand Migration and Quest On Demand Migration for Email.\n\nSkyKick:\n\nSkyKick provides automated migration tools for Microsoft 365, including cross-tenant scenarios.\n\nShareGate:\n\nKnown for its ShareGate Desktop and ShareGate Migrate tools, which support SharePoint, Teams and OneDrive migrations. They have recently integrated mailbox migration.\n\nCodeTwo:\n\nCodeTwo offers migration solutions for Microsoft 365, including cross-tenant mailbox migrations.\n\nTable of comparison:\n\n* leader\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of cloud collaboration, cross-tenant migrations have become a critical undertaking for organizations. Whether due to mergers, acquisitions, or strategic realignments, the need to seamlessly transition data between Microsoft 365 tenants is more prevalent than ever.\n\nVendor Selection Matters: Choosing the right migration solution is paramount. Evaluate vendors based on factors such as scope of migration, reliability, scalability, support, and ease of use. Consider both native Microsoft tools and third-party offerings.\n\nPreparation Is Key: Properly prepare your source and target tenants. Establish trust relationships, configure identity mapping, and ensure that users are set up correctly in the destination tenant.\n\nData Integrity and Security: During migration, prioritize data integrity and security. Test thoroughly, monitor progress, and address any issues promptly.\n\nCommunication and Change Management: Keep stakeholders informed throughout the process. Effective communication minimizes disruption and ensures a smooth transition for end-users.\n\nPost-Migration Validation: Validate data integrity, permissions, and functionality post-migration. Address any discrepancies promptly.\n\nRemember, cross-tenant migrations are not just about moving data; they impact user productivity, collaboration, and overall business continuity. By following best practices and leveraging the right tools, organizations can navigate this complex journey successfully.",
      "# [Software-Focused Growth Equity](https://tvccapital.com/)\n“When we went looking for an investment partner, I wasn’t interested in having another boss. We were seeking a partner who would leverage their expertise to improve our company’s bottom line. For BitTitan, TVC is more than an investor. They understand that running and growing a company is hard and their advice enables our success as we navigate uncharted territories. The team at TVC is always accessible for anything we need. We consider TVC a trusted business partner.”\n\n“Throughout the lifecycle of the investment, TVC was a great partner for me as CEO and for the business itself. Their operating experience provided great insights and enabled us to better plan, measure, and grow the business to achieve a significant increase in valuation.”\n\n“Partnering with TVC Capital was game-changing for Limeade. They provide real operating insights in ways most venture investors can’t. Every day, they put their reputation, connections and experience to work for us — whether we ask or not. They are investors, but also friends and mentors.”\n\n“I’ve had the good fortune of working with TVC Capital twice as a CEO. During my first experience working with TVC Capital, they represented our first and only institutional capital and, over the course of five years, they proved essential in helping us execute on our business plan and ultimately exit the company successfully with a sale to Polycom in 2011. When I joined MediaPlatform as CEO in 2015, TVC Capital was the first prospective investor I approached and, thankfully, we’re working together again. Over the 10+ years I’ve worked with them, their capabilities continue to get more and more impressive, but they still maintain a critical level of accessibility and involvement of a trusted partner.”\n\n“TVC Capital is not just an investor, they are a trusted partner. TVC consistently provides useful guidance and is always available to provide direct feedback on an approach. They deliver a sense of ‘patient urgency’ in our interactions bringing a healthy blend of experience from real challenges and encouraging push for accomplishments. ReverseVision is my second firm with TVC as an investor. Given all the options available, this second round indicates how highly valued the relationship has become. I would not hesitate to participate with them again in the future.”",

      "# [How to move file shares from on-prem to cloud by Tim O’Neill on 2023-11-15](https://itbrief.com.au/story/how-to-move-file-shares-from-on-prem-to-cloud)\nIt may be time to migrate file shares to SharePoint, OneDrive and Teams, and security is a major reason.\n\nThe Azure Cloud has proved to be the better cybersecurity option compared to on-premises servers. Now, with the October end-of-support date, Microsoft is no longer making updates to Windows 2012 servers.\n\nThat means no security patches and no support options. SharePoint Server 2019 also moves from mainstream to extended support in just a few months.\n\nFile shares are centralised files hosted on a network server or network drive or shared files and disks on local computers. These files are referred to in many organisations as a 'Z drive'. If an organisation still has file shares, employees are probably very familiar with how to access and use them.\n\nThat doesn't mean the situation is ideal. It just means they're used to it, like the extra nudge we have to give a door that always sticks.\n\nIt's important to remember that moving files isn't just about moving files. For anyone adopting Teams, SharePoint and OneDrive or expanding Microsoft 365 deployment within an organisation, it is essential to make sure users are ready for a big change in how they access and share documents.\n\nSo let's plan for a smooth conversion and migration.\n\nBeware of the benefits-only approach to platform conversion. Management can talk about easier file access, more productivity and seamless collaboration, but teams can lose trust if they don't acknowledge the potential pain of making a big change. Any major conversion or adoption needs to include careful planning on the front end and empathetic communication throughout.\n\nA smooth migration also helps reassure employees that their files are safe and accounted for. My company's solution makes it easy to plan and execute any size file migration and includes features to customise a project to the needs of the organisation.\n\nIt's easy for internal IT teams to learn and use, but it's also a top choice for MSPs and consultants who use it to deliver successful migrations for their clients.\n\nPreparation is key. A file share migration will go most smoothly with careful planning. Make a plan for what goes where. This starts with a rigorous review of how files are currently stored.\n\nFiles that belong to a single user, even if they plan to share them with others, should be mapped to their personal OneDrive. A file or folder intended for team collaboration should move to a shared library where team members can access it by default.\n\nAfter thoroughly examining the existing file landscape, IT may determine that it's necessary to do some cleanup before moving forward with a migration. Taking this step not only makes the migration run more smoothly, but it can also save on storage costs and help end-users increase their productivity.\n\nDepending on the size and structure of the organisation, this cleanup phase may involve putting together a team of representatives from each department tasked with making decisions about file structure.\n\nPreparation also includes setting up the target Azure environment. An understanding of the current file share landscape will help to estimate Azure storage needs and costs. This information is required to purchase an Azure subscription and create an account.\n\nThere's one more step before migration: preparing the destination environment. This involves pre-provisioning users in Microsoft 365, setting the permissions that will be used for the migration, and creating a destination site or subsite and document library within SharePoint.\n\nOnce all the prep work has been done, it's time to migrate. Our solution is not just a full-featured, flexible and secure migration tool, the people behind it are committed to clients' success.\n\nWhether an organisation is doing its first migration or migrating file shares for the first time, its team can access learning materials and migration guides that will navigate through every step.\n\nMy company's comprehensive migration planning and strategy guide will help. It includes links to knowledge base articles, FAQs and other resources that will answer questions. Users can also access free tutorial videos on a wide range of migration topics, including OneDrive to SharePoint Migration Setup.\n\nThe steps to completing a file share migration are easy to learn: create a document project, add items, verify credentials, and then either migrate all at once or in stages. There are a few more steps to take post-migration to maintain a secure environment.\n\nThese include removing access to source file shares, decommissioning the file server, and deleting Azure blog containers created during the upload. All of this is detailed in documentation and educational materials.\n\nUser engagement is an important part of any major migration, especially one that involves a new platform or new work processes. A migration plan should include start-to-finish communications that inform users about what to expect, the benefits of the change, and who to contact for help.\n\nMore detailed communications should go to key stakeholders, and this can include stats on the success of the migration from the solution console.\n\nProvide training to users unfamiliar with OneDrive or SharePoint to help them become more confident and productive post-migration. This is another time to engage department representatives. They can act as ambassadors to help troubleshoot any concerns about seemingly misplaced files or permission changes.\n\nMoving file shares to the cloud may be inevitable, but it should be done with careful consideration and the best tools. My company's solution documents migration and will quickly and securely move files to the correct destinations.",

      "# [Nine factors to consider when choosing Google Workspace by Nabeel Mukhtar on 2024-01-16](https://itbrief.com.au/story/nine-factors-to-consider-when-choosing-google-workspace)\nShould an organisation move to Google Workspace? Maybe. The answer should be based on an evaluation of multiple factors specific to how the organisation does business. It's not an easy yes or no.\n\nWhat is easy is how to get there, and the answer is via a dedicated migration app.\n\nMore than mail and calendars, Google Workspace boosts cloud collaboration with tools for messaging and meetings; multiple options for creating, storing and sharing work; and ways to unleash a team's creativity with presentations and collaborative whiteboards.\n\nWhile Microsoft 365 has long held major mind space when it comes to business productivity platforms, Google Workspace is a favourite solution for many organisations.\n\nSo how do you choose?\n\nThere's no definitive answer when it comes to deciding which platform is right for any business. The choice should be based on a thoughtful analysis of the current and future needs of your organisation.\n\nIt can be tempting to simply compare Google Workspace pricing and cloud storage with what Microsoft offers. But don't stop there. Consider the following questions in the analysis:\n\nWhat fits the size of an organization? Don't buy a solution that's outsized for its needs, but don't think too small if it's a growing organisation. It probably won't make sense to use a free version long-term, especially because it doesn't come with human support.\n\nHow do the people work? Are they more solitary, or is daily collaboration fundamental to business success? If collaboration is a must, be sure the chosen platform provides lots of options to interact, brainstorm, share and document ideas.\n\nWhere are the people located? A cloud solution like Google Workspace makes remote teamwork easy, even across time zones and geographies.\n\nWhat is the team used to? A productivity platform that's intuitive and easy to adopt saves time and frustration. An organisation may find that many of its employees use Google tools in their personal lives, or became familiar with them in school.\n\nAre certain features important to the business model? For example, if a team needs to conduct webinars, multimedia presentations, or interactive brainstorming sessions easily, these will become decision drivers. On the other hand, look carefully at features that only seem 'nice to have'.\n\nDo you need to integrate third-party tools? While Google Workspace includes an impressive array of tools, most organisations have a few specialised applications as well. Be sure to choose the platform that plays well with third-party integrations.\n\nWhat do the clients or vendors use? While this shouldn't be the top reason for choosing Google versus Microsoft, having compatible platforms can remove friction in client and vendor relationships.\n\nWhy are you changing platforms? Some IT environments have evolved into a patchwork of tools over time. Others have divisions using different platforms after a merger or acquisition.\n\nIt may be tempting to choose the platform that's been around the longest, or the one used at headquarters, but it's worth doing a deeper analysis to match the platform with today's needs.\n\nAre there any dealbreakers? Put the organisation's must-haves at the top of the list and research how their preferred solutions do on those items. This will save a lot of headaches (and complaints) in the long run.\n\nSo, do the analysis, then make the move. Take time to compare the benefits each productivity platform being considered. With Google Workspace, organisations can add a lot of checks in the 'yes' column. Just be sure to match those features with current and future needs.\n\nIt may take a little more time to complete a thorough analysis, but your migration will happen quickly when you use a specialist migration app such as my own company's.\n\nSeek a tool that makes cross-platform migrations easy, whether moving to the cloud or between cloud tenants. Learn more about migrating to Google Workspace or contact us for help setting up the migration project. If you're ready to migrate, check the available licences.\n\nAs a is a technical pre-sales specialist at BitTitan the author, Nabeel Mukhtar, specialises in data migration across Office 365, Google environments and other platforms.\n\nWith a background in managing SaaS tools and native migration solutions, he navigates tenant-to-tenant transitions expertly, ensuring seamless integration for clients.

    "# BitTitan Comprehensive Analyst Report\n\n## Company Overview\n\nBitTitan is a leading provider of cloud migration solutions, particularly known for its flagship product, MigrationWiz. Founded in 2009, the company has successfully migrated over 19 million users to the cloud for 43,000 customers across 187 countries. BitTitan specializes in managed services automation, empowering IT service professionals to deploy and manage cloud technologies efficiently [(BitTitan, 2024)](https://get.bittitan.com/blog/bittitan-news/bittitan-launches-migrationwiz-active-directory-migration-solution/).\n\n### Recent Recognition\n\nIn August 2024, BitTitan was awarded the title of Best SaaS Product for IT Management by the 2024 SaaS Awards. This accolade highlights the company's commitment to simplifying data migrations and enabling organizations to adapt to technological changes seamlessly. Annabelle Whittall, the lead judge of the SaaS Awards, praised MigrationWiz for its \"comprehensive, automated approach to data and workload migration\" and its user-friendly interface [(Cary, 2024)](https://get.bittitan.com/blog/bittitan-news/bittitan-recognized-as-best-saas-product-for-it-management/).\n\n### Executive Insights\n\nAaron Wadsworth, the General Manager at BitTitan, expressed pride in receiving the award, stating, \"This recognition reflects our team’s relentless dedication to providing innovative solutions that empower IT professionals worldwide\" [(Cary, 2024)](https://get.bittitan.com/blog/bittitan-news/bittitan-recognized-as-best-saas-product-for-it-management/). This sentiment underscores the company's focus on customer success and innovation in the cloud migration space.\n\n## Product Overview: MigrationWiz\n\nMigrationWiz is BitTitan's flagship product, designed to facilitate seamless data migration across various cloud platforms. It is particularly noted for its platform-agnostic design, which allows for flexibility in migrating data between different environments, including Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and others [(Garg, 2024)](https://get.bittitan.com/blog/bittitan-news/bittitan-launches-migrationwiz-active-directory-migration-solution/).\n\n### New Developments\n\nIn April 2024, BitTitan launched new Active Directory (AD) migration capabilities within MigrationWiz. This feature allows users to transfer identities and organizational unit structures from one AD environment to another without requiring a network connection. The tool automates the migration process, ensuring minimal disruption and preserving data integrity [(Garg, 2024)](https://get.bittitan.com/blog/bittitan-news/bittitan-launches-migrationwiz-active-directory-migration-solution/). Mark Rochester, a Cloud Architect, noted the tool's reliability and efficiency, stating, \"This new functionality significantly automates the Active Directory migration process for our customers\" [(Garg, 2024)](https://get.bittitan.com/blog/bittitan-news/bittitan-launches-migrationwiz-active-directory-migration-solution/).\n\n### Key Features\n\nMigrationWiz offers several advanced features, including:\n\n- **Automatic Discovery and Migration**: Automatically identifies and migrates AD objects, including users and groups.\n- **Password Synchronization**: Ensures a seamless user experience by synchronizing passwords between old and new AD environments.\n- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Administrators can monitor migration status and identify issues in real-time.\n- **Advanced Mapping and Filtering**: Allows for precise mapping of source and target AD objects, filtering out unwanted data.\n- **Integration with Other Tools**: Works in conjunction with other MigrationWiz tools for comprehensive migration solutions [(Garg, 2024)](https://get.bittitan.com/blog/bittitan-news/bittitan-launches-migrationwiz-active-directory-migration-solution/).\n\n## Market Position and Competitors\n\nBitTitan's MigrationWiz is recognized as a leading solution in the cloud migration market, competing with other notable tools such as Quest On Demand Migration and AvePoint. While Quest offers robust features for tenant-to-tenant migrations, MigrationWiz is praised for its user-friendly interface and comprehensive support services, making it suitable for users of all technical backgrounds [(Dreux, 2024)](https://www.migrationasaservice.com/top-cloud-migration-tools/top-5-microsoft-teams-migration-solutions-in-2024/).\n\n## Partnerships and Collaborations\n\nBitTitan has established strong partnerships with major cloud service providers, including Microsoft, Google, and Dropbox. These collaborations enhance the functionality of MigrationWiz and ensure that it remains compatible with the latest cloud technologies [(Garg, 2024)](https://get.bittitan.com/blog/bittitan-news/bittitan-launches-migrationwiz-active-directory-migration-solution/).\n\n## Financial Insights\n\nWhile specific financial details are not disclosed in the articles, the recognition from the SaaS Awards and the launch of new features suggest a positive trajectory for BitTitan. The company's focus on innovation and customer satisfaction positions it well for future growth in the competitive cloud migration market.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBitTitan stands out as a leader in the cloud migration space, with its MigrationWiz product receiving accolades for its effectiveness and user-friendliness. The recent launch of new features, such as the Active Directory migration tool, further solidifies its commitment to innovation and customer success. For prospective candidates and investors, BitTitan represents a promising opportunity in the rapidly evolving IT landscape. \n\nFor more information, visit [BitTitan's official website](https://www.bittitan.com)."
