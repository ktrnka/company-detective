      "# [Secure Cloud Migration with BitTitan MigrationWiz on 2022-11-30](https://www.bittitan.com/security/)\nSecurity and Compliance\n\nAs an IT professional you need to be able to assure your clients that their data is secure at every step of the process—not just once it’s in the cloud. We take the security and compliance of your clients’ data very seriously.\n\nAt BitTitan, we take data security and privacy very seriously. Our product has been used to migrate Fortune 100 companies, American and foreign governments, police departments, banks, stock exchanges, telecoms, hospitals, and healthcare organizations – all with very stringent security requirements. Read the BitTitan Security Overview White Paper attached below for a more detailed view of our policies.\n\nISO Certifications\n\nISO 27001 – The world’s best-known standard for information security management systems (ISMS). ISO 27001 means BitTitan has put in place a system to manage cybersecurity risks that respects best practices and principles of the International Organization for Standardization.\n\nISO 27701 – Built to complement ISO 27001, this standard specifies requirements and provides guidance for a Privacy Information Management System (PIMS) for personal data. This framework allows you to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements including GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\n\nZero Deployment\n\nBitTitan products operate outside of the firewall and connect to messaging systems the same way any external user would. There is no need to install third-party software inside of your firewall or network.\n\nMailbox Data\n\nMailbox data (including subjects, bodies, attachments, etc.) are not stored on our servers. In some cases, the data may be cached temporarily in order to optimize network throughput. If cached, rest assured that your data is wiped immediately once that mailbox is done migrating.\n\nMailbox Credentials\n\nMailbox credentials are stored using military-grade AES encryption. The credentials are immediately purged from the system once you delete the corresponding configuration to which it is associated.\n\nAuto-Purge Policy\n\nWe have implemented an automatic purge policy that will delete any configuration that is not used. If no migration has been performed within 90 days (either of your last migration or creation of configuration, whichever is later), we will delete the data from our servers. You can configure this to be a longer or shorter period.\n\nData Centers\n\nBitTitan leverages Azure data centers, which are compliant with ISO/IEC 27001/27002:2013, SOC 1 Type 2 and SOC 2 Type 2, PCI DSS Level 1, FISMA, HIPAA/HITECH, CJIS, CSA CCM, FERPA and others. Customers can select from a variety of data center regions in which migrations will be processed. We offer data center locations in ​Australia, Europe, North America, Japan, South America, and Southeast Asia.",

The sheer volume of demands will always go up and your customers are going to solutions that help them stay up-to-speed while also not getting sidetracked from their end goal. A business without automation is sluggish and a pain for employees. Menial work that takes up hours of time and money can now be taken care of with a fraction of the stress and effort.\n\n“We don’t have people who are in charge of opening or closing projects anymore. We’ve essentially automated all of that,” says Chris Lehr of Strategic Projects & Services. “If I see something that’s going to take too long, we fix that problem.”\n\nMSPs, now more than ever, need to be prepared to solve these puzzles. Think of them as tech sudoku. The problem is right there in front of you, with the gaps waiting to be filled. That’s where automation comes in.",

      "# [PowerShell Documentation](https://www.bittitan.com/doc/powershell.html)\nIntroductionâ\n\nOverview\n\nThe BitTitan PowerShell module is a set of PowerShell commands that let you manage your BitTitan data. Examples of operations you can perform with the BitTitan PowerShell module are:\n\nCreating customers and resources associated with these customers\n\nDeploying services and monitoring the status of their tasks\n\nConfiguring MigrationWiz projects and users\n\nSubmitting migrations and monitoring migration progress and statistics\n\nThe list of all BitTitan cmdlets can be found in the BitTitan cmdlet reference.\n\nThe following documentation contain sample scripts that illustrate actions that you can perform using the BitTitan SDK. You will find more sample scripts at the BitTitan internal repository.\n\nNote that some of the sample scripts below use a .\\Init.ps1 script, you can also find in the BitTitan internal repository.\n\nSystem requirements\n\nMicrosoft Windows PowerShell 4.0\n\nMicrosoft.NET Framework 4.6.1\n\nPowerShell module installation\n\nUninstall previous versions of the PowerShell\n\nVersions that were installed before October 5, 2016 are listed as \"MigrationWiz PowerShell\" under your program list in the Control Panel. This is because earlier versions were known as \"MigrationWiz PowerShell\" rather than \"BitTitan PowerShell.\" The current version is \"BitTitan PowerShell\". If you are using MigrationWiz PowerShell, we recommend you to uninstall it and install BitTitan PowerShell.\n\nInstall the SDK\n\nStep 1: Click HERE to download our BitTitan PowerShell module.\n\nStep 2: Run the MSI to install the PowerShell module and associated sample scripts.\n\nStep 3: Import the BitTitanPowershell module containing the cmdlets and associated scripts.\n\nTo import the module and make the commands available use the following:\n\nImport-Module 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\BitTitan\\BitTitan PowerShell\\BitTitanPowerShell.dll'\n\nNote: You will have to import the module for each PowerShell session; alternatively, you can modify your PowerShell Profile to include the Import-Module command.\n\nGet the list of BitTitan PowerShell module commands\n\nThe BitTitan PowerShell module contains two types of commands: MigrationWiz commands and BitTitan commands. MigrationWiz commands and BitTitan commands use different authentication tickets and you will need to use MigrationWiz tickets with MigrationWiz commands, and BitTitan tickets with BitTitan commands.\n\nMigrationWiz commands use a MW_ prefix, while BitTitan commands use a BT_ prefix.\n\nYou can get the full list of BitTitan PowerShell commands by invoking the following cmdlet:\n\nGet-Command -Module BitTitanPowerShell\n\nYou will find the following types of commands:\n\nMigrationWiz\n\n# MigrationWiz retrieve commands Get-Command -Module BitTitanPowerShell | Where-Object {$_.Name -like \"Get-MW_*\"} # MigrationWiz create commands Get-Command -Module BitTitanPowerShell | Where-Object {$_.Name -like \"Add-MW_*\"} # MigrationWiz update commands Get-Command -Module BitTitanPowerShell | Where-Object {$_.Name -like \"Set-MW_*\"} # MigrationWiz delete commands Get-Command -Module BitTitanPowerShell | Where-Object {$_.Name -like \"Remove-MW_*\"} # MigrationWiz new commands Get-Command -Module BitTitanPowerShell | Where-Object {$_.Name -like \"New-MW_*\"} # Other MigrationWiz commands Get-Command -Module BitTitanPowerShell | Where-Object {$_.Name -notlike \"Get-BT_*\" -and $_.Name -notlike \"Get-MW_*\" -and $_.Name -notlike \"Add-BT_*\" -and $_.Name -notlike \"Add-MW_*\" -and $_.Name -notlike \"Set-BT_*\" -and $_.Name -notlike \"Set-MW_*\" -and $_.Name -notlike \"Remove-BT_*\" -and $_.Name -notlike \"Remove-MW_*\"}\n\nBitTitan\n\n# BitTitan retrieve commands Get-Command -Module BitTitanPowerShell | Where-Object {$_.Name -like \"Get-BT_*\"} # BitTitan create commands Get-Command -Module BitTitanPowerShell | Where-Object {$_.Name -like \"Add-BT_*\"} # BitTitan update commands Get-Command -Module BitTitanPowerShell| Where-Object {$_.Name -like \"Set-BT_*\"} # BitTitan delete commands Get-Command -Module BitTitanPowerShell | Where-Object {$_.Name -like \"Remove-BT_*\"} # BitTitan new commands Get-Command -Module BitTitanPowerShell | Where-Object {$_.Name -like \"New-BT_*\"}\n\nRequests\n\nOverview\n\nThis section describes how to perform CRUD operations using the BitTitan SDK.\n\nInitialize-MSPC_Context\n\nThe cmdlet, Initialize-MSPC_Context, creates a global variable $mspc, which contains a number of useful fields:\n\nTicket: A ticket used in BT cmdlets\n\nMigrationWizTicket: A ticket used in MW cmdlets\n\nCustomer: A customer.\n\nCustomerTicket: A customer scoped ticket.\n\nWorkgroup: A workgroup.\n\nWorkgroupTicket: A workgroup scoped ticket.\n\nData: A hashtable that stores global data.\n\nThe $mspc context object created by this cmdlet is identical to the $mspc variable available to every script running on the MSPC automation platform.\n\nThus it is recommended to run the Initialize-MSPC_Context cmdlet before testing Runbook scripts locally.\n\nSince the $mspc context created is a global variable, it is useful when debugging a single script or multiple scripts as you do not need to enter credentials and variable inputs each time.\n\nA few syntaxes are available for the cmdlet:\n\n# This script illustrates how to use the Initialize-MSPC_Context cmdlet. # Case 1: Initialize an mspc context with a customer ID # Note: the customer's workgroup is used in creating both the workgroup and workgroup ticket. Initialize-MSPC_Context -Credentials $credentials -CustomerId 'your customer ID here' # Case 2: Initialize an mspc context with a workgroup ID # Note: no customer nor customer ticket are created in this case. Initialize-MSPC_Context -Credentials $credentials -WorkgroupId 'your workgroup ID here' # Case 3: Clear the existing global $mspc context # Note: clears the existing $mspc context before creating a new mspc context. Initialize-MSPC_Context -Clear\n\nRetrieve requests\n\nRetrieve requests require tickets and have the following parameters:\n\nTicket: The authentication ticket\n\nPageSize: The number of items per page. Default value is 100.\n\nPageOffset: The number of pages skipped. Default value is 0.\n\n<PropertyName>: See \"Filtering\"\n\nSort_By_<PropertyName>_<Order>: See \"Sorting\"\n\nRetrieveAll: Used to retrieve all entities. More examples below.\n\nRetrieve requests return PowerShell objects.\n\nHere are a few common use cases:\n\n# This script shows different ways to retrieve entities # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential -Message \"Enter BitTitan credentials\" $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan # Retrieve a customer and get a ticket for it $customerId = [GUID](Read-Host -Prompt 'Customer ID') $customer = Get-BT_Customer -Ticket $ticket -Id $customerId $customerTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Ticket $ticket -OrganizationId $customer.OrganizationId # Here are 3 common ways to retrieve entities # 1. Retrieve all the endpoints under a customer and process them one by one # Use -RetrieveAll and piping with ForEach Get-BT_Endpoint -Ticket $customerTicket -IsDeleted False -RetrieveAll | ForEach { # Process each endpoint retrieved Write-Host $_.Name } # 2. Retrieve and process endpoints under a customer in batches # Use paging $pageSize = 100 $count = 0 While( $true ) { # Retrieve endpoints in batch [array]$batch = Get-BT_Endpoint -Ticket $customerTicket -IsDeleted False -PageOffset $($count * $pageSize) if ( -not $batch ) { break } # Update each endpoint in the batch ForEach($endpoint in $batch) { $endpoint.Name += \"_test\" } # Send update request Set-BT_Endpoint -Ticket $customerTicket -Endpoint $batch # Increase count $count ++ } # 3. Retrieve all the endpoints under a customer to get certain info, e.g. count # Use -RetrieveAll # Note: This is the least efficient way among the 3 cases since it loads all the entities into the memory $endpoints = Get-BT_Endpoint -Ticket $customerTicket -IsDeleted False -RetrieveAll $endpoints.Count\n\nCreate requests\n\nCreate requests require tickets and have the following parameters:\n\nTicket: The authentication ticket\n\n<PropertyName>: The property field of the object to create\n\nMost of the created objects will have the following fields:\n\nId: Guid representing the unique object id\n\nCreated: Creation time\n\nUpdated: Time of the latest update\n\nIsDeleted: Whether the entity has been deleted. Will always be false.\n\nVersion: Field reserved for future versions\n\nSystemUserId: Id of the system user who created the object\n\nOrganizationId: Id of the organization of the customer who owns the object\n\nIn this example, we create a customer:\n\n# This script illustrates how to create entities # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan # Create a customer $customer = Add-BT_Customer -Ticket $ticket -CompanyName \"TestCustomer\" -PrimaryDomain \"testCustomer.com\" Write-Output $customer\n\nDelete requests\n\nDelete requests require tickets and have the following parameters:\n\nTicket: The authentication ticket\n\nId: The IDs of the entity(ies) to delete\n\nThis example shows:\n\nHow to delete a single endpoint\n\nHow to delete multiple endpoints at a time\n\n# This script illustrates how to delete entities # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan # Get a customer ticket $customer = Get-BT_Customer -Ticket $ticket -CompanyName \"Default\" $customerTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Ticket $ticket -OrganizationId $customer.OrganizationId # Retrieve and delete a single endpoint $endpoint = Get-BT_Endpoint -Ticket $customerTicket -Name \"Test Endpoint\" -IsDeleted False Remove-BT_Endpoint -Ticket $customerTicket -Id $endpoint.Id # Retrieve and delete multiple endpoints $endpoints = Get-BT_Endpoint -Ticket $customerTicket -Name @(\"Endpoint 1\", \"Endpoint 2\") -IsDeleted False Remove-BT_Endpoint -Ticket $customerTicket -Id $endpoints.Id\n\nFiltering\n\nFilter parameters perform filtering on the server side to improve performance. If performance is not a concern, you can perform filtering on the client side using the Where-Object cmdlet instead.\n\nThe comparison operators are >, <, =, ==, <=, >=, !, !=, eq, exacty, lt, le, gt, ge, ne, not, after, before. Filtering against null value is also provided with operators IsNull and IsNotNull.\n\nThe wildcard character % (percent sign) is supported for string filtering and represents zero, one, or multiple characters. Wildcard character works with =, ==, eq, exactly or simply with default operator. To escape the wildcard character and search for a percent sign, you can use \"[%]\" (e.g. \"75[%]\" to look for \"75%\").\n\nThere are five types of filters, corresponding to different property types\n\nNumbers and dates: <PropertyName> \"<Operator> <PropertyValue>\"\n\ne.g. -Created @(\"> 01-01-2016\")\n\nStrings: <PropertyName> \"<PropertyValue>\"\n\ne.g. -CompanyName \"BitTitan\"\n\nOther types (equal only): <PropertyName> <PropertyValue>\n\ne.g. -Id 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\n\nArray of filters on numbers and dates: <PropertyName> @(\"<Operator1> <PropertyValue1>\", \"<Operator2> <PropertyValue2>\")\n\ne.g. -Created @(\"> 01-01-2016\", \"< 01-01-2018\")\n\nFilter against null: <PropertyName> \"IsNull\" or \"IsNotNull\"\n\ne.g. -Configuration \"IsNull\"\n\nFilters accept an array of property values as well:\n\n<PropertyName> <Array of Property values>\n\ne.g. -CompanyName @(\"BitTitan\", \"Microsoft\")\n\nThis example shows how to use different types of filters:\n\n# This script illustrates how to filter entities when retrieving them # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan $mwTicket = Get-MW_Ticket -Credentials $creds # Retrieve endpoints, filtered by date and string property $endpoints = Get-BT_Endpoint -Ticket $ticket -Created @(\"> 01-01-2016\", \"< 01-01-2018\") -Name @(\"Endpoint1\", \"Endpoint2\") # Retrieve mailbox connectors, filtered by a string with a wildcard and by multiple Ids $mailboxConnectors = Get-MW_MailboxConnector -Ticket $mwTicket -FilterBy_String_Name \"%project\" -SelectedExportEndpointId $endpoints.Id\n\nDependent entity filtering\n\nWhat is a dependent entity?\n\nA dependent entity is an entity that has a relationship with the main entity.\n\ne.g. Subscription entity is a dependent entity of CustomerEndUser entity. A CustomerEndUser's Id is equal to its related subscription entity's EntityReferenceId.\n\nHow are dependent entity filtering parameters formed?\n\nDependent entity filtering parameters are used in Get-BT_* cmdlets.\n\nA dependent entity filtering parameter is built by combining the dependent entity's name and the dependent entity property's name.\n\ne.g. CustomerEndUser has a dependent entity: Subscription, which has a property named SubscriptionEndDate, so Get-BT_CustomerEndUser has a parameter -SubscriptionSubscriptionEndDate.\n\nHow does dependent entity filtering work?\n\nUnlike normal filtering parameters, dependent entity filtering allows retrieval of entities based on the dependent entity's properties.\n\n# This script illustrates how to retrieve entities with dependent entity filtering # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential -Message \"Enter BitTitan credentials\" $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan # To get a workgroup that has a customer named BitTitan $workgroup = Get-BT_Workgroup -Ticket $ticket -CustomerCompanyName 'BitTitan' # To get all customer end users with unprocessed subscriptions $customerEndUsers = Get-BT_CustomerEndUser -Ticket $ticket -SubscriptionSubscriptionProcessState NotProcessed\n\nWhich entities support dependent entity filtering?\n\nDependent entity filtering is available for the list of entities below:\n\nMain EntityDependent EntitiesCustomerProjectStats, ExtendedPropertyCustomerApplicationExtendedPropertyCustomerDeviceCustomerDeviceUser, CustomerDeviceUserModule, ExtendedPropertyCustomerEndUserCustomerDeviceUser, CustomerDeviceUserModule, Subscription, Customer, ExtendedPropertyCustomerGroupExtendedPropertyCustomerResourceExtendedPropertyEndpointExtendedPropertyOfferingInstanceSystemUser, OfferingMetadata, CustomerOrganizationMemberSystemUser, WorkgroupTeamMembershipSystemUserWorkgroupCustomer\n\nSorting\n\nSort parameters perform sorting on the server side to improve performance. If performance is not a concern, you can perform sorting on the client side using the Sort-Object cmdlet.\n\nSort parameters are available for numbers and dates. The format is Sort_By_<PropertyName>_<Order> and only one sort parameter can be specified.\n\nThis example shows how to retrieve entities sorted by a property:\n\n# This script illustrates how to sort entities when retrieving them # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan # Retrieve endpoints, sorted by created date $endpoints = Get-BT_Endpoint -Ticket $ticket -SortBy_Created_Descending\n\nPipelined Input\n\nIn PowerShell, a pipeline is a series of commands connected by pipeline operators ( | ) and is used commonly. Each pipeline operator sends the results of the preceding command to the next command.\n\nThe SDK supports pipelined input for any Set-BT_* and Remove-BT_* cmdlet.\n\nThe following is an example of how to use BT cmdlets in a pipeline:\n\n# This script illustrates how to use pipelines with the BitTitan SDK # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan # Get a customer ticket $customer = Get-BT_Customer -Ticket $ticket -CompanyName \"Default\" $customerTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Ticket $ticket -OrganizationId $customer.OrganizationId # Get all users associated to the customer and archive them Get-BT_CustomerEndUser -Ticket $customerTicket -IsDeleted $false -RetrieveAll | Set-BT_CustomerEndUser -Ticket $customerTicket -IsArchived $true # Get all devices associated to the customer and delete them Get-BT_CustomerDevice -Ticket $customerTicket -IsDeleted $false -RetrieveAll | Remove-BT_CustomerDevice -Ticket $customerTicket -Force\n\nError handling\n\nA typical PowerShell error looks like this:\n\n$endpoints = Get-BT_Endpoint -Ticket $btTicket -SortBy_Version_Ascending -SortBy_Created_Ascending\n\nGet-BT_Endpoint : Only one SortBy_ switch should be specified. At line:1 char:14 + ... endpoints = Get-BT_Endpoint -Ticket $btTicket -SortBy_Version_Ascendi... + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + CategoryInfo : NotSpecified: (:) [Get-BT_Endpoint], Exception + FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.Exception,BitTitan.Powershell.Cmdlets.GetBTEndpoint\n\nFollowing is a list of common error messages you might encounter:\n\n\"Set-BT_Customer: Update failed with 'Error: EntityInstanceNotFound'\": The object has been deleted from the database and cannot be updated.\n\n\"Add-BT_Customer: Create failed with 'Error: PropertyMustBeSet,{ property : CompanyName },{ value : }'\": The CompanyName is mandatory and you need to specify the value of CompanyName to create the object.\n\n\"Add-BT_Customer: Create failed with 'Error: Unknown.

A service is divided into tasks\n\nTask: represents an IT task, which belongs to an IT service you can launch from MSPComplete\n\nFeed: represents alerts, warning and information related to your account and to your workgroup\n\nSubscription: represents an end user subscription that is required to run MSPComplete services for this user\n\nWorkgroups and Customers\n\nWorkgroups\n\nA workgroup represents an environment containing sets of customers, end users, teams, and member information. More information about workgroups is available in the Help Center article, Add, edit, and switch workgroups.\n\nEvery BitTitan account is associated with at least one workgroup.\n\nThis example shows how to retrieve and create workgroups, using the Get-BT_Workgroup and Add-BT_Workgroup cmdlets:\n\n# This script illustrates how to retrieve and create workgroups # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan # Retrieve workgroups $workgroups = Get-BT_Workgroup -Ticket $ticket Write-Output $workgroups # Create a new workgroup $newWorkgroup = Add-BT_Workgroup -Ticket $ticket -Name \"Test Workgroup\" Write-Output $newWorkgroup\n\nCustomers\n\nCustomers are the companies whose IT and cloud infrastructure you manage and to whom you deliver a customized array of managed services. You can retrieve and/or create new customers as illustrated in this sample script:\n\n# This script illustrates how to create a customer # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential -Message \"Enter BitTitan credentials\" $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan # Initialize variables $primaryDomain = \"an-it-company.com\" $companyName = \"IT Company\" $countryName = \"Italy\" # Optional # Retrieve the workgroup that the customer should be created under $workgroupId = [GUID](Read-Host -Prompt 'Workgroup ID') $workgroup = Get-BT_Workgroup -Ticket $ticket -Id $workgroupId # Check if a customer with the same domain already exists under this workgroup $existingCustomer = Get-BT_Customer -Ticket $ticket -WorkgroupId $workgroup.Id -PrimaryDomain $primaryDomain if ( $existingCustomer -ne $null ) { # Write a warning if a customer already exists Write-warning \"Customer with primary domain $primaryDomain already exists. A new customer was not created.\" } else { # Add a new customer # Additional parameters can be set such as CityName, IndustryType, CompanySize and more # Use Get-Help Add-BT_Customer to see all parameters Add-BT_Customer -Ticket $ticket -WorkgroupId $workgroup.Id -PrimaryDomain $primaryDomain -CompanyName $companyName -CountryName $countryName }\n\nTicket organization\n\nA ticket is always bound to a BitTitan account and can also be scoped to an organization. An organization is associated with either a workgroup or a customer.\n\nA ticket scoped to a workgroup organization will only have access to the customers, end users, services, teams and information belonging to that workgroup\n\nA ticket scoped a customer organization will only have access to the end users, services and information related to the customer.\n\nA ticket that does not have an organization ID has access to all the workgroups and customers associated with the BitTitan account.\n\nThe following example shows how to create a ticket scoped to a workgroup and one scoped to a customer.\n\n# This script shows how to get an authentication ticket # 1) Scoped to a customer # 2) Scoped to a workgroup # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan # 1) Get a ticket scoped to a customer $customerId = [GUID](Read-Host -Prompt 'Customer ID') $customer = Get-BT_Customer -Ticket $ticket -Id $customerId $customerTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Ticket $ticket -OrganizationId $customer.OrganizationId # 2) Get a ticket scoped to a workgroup $workgroupId = [GUID](Read-Host -Prompt 'Workgroup ID') $workgroup = Get-BT_Workgroup -Ticket $ticket -Id $workgroupId $workgroupTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Ticket $ticket -OrganizationId $workgroup.WorkgroupOrganizationId\n\nFollowing is an example of organizations and system users (also known as BitTitan accounts) that have access to these organizations:\n\nSystemUser A and SystemUser B are members of Organization 1\n\nThey have access to Workgroup 1\n\nThey have access to all the entities under Workgroup 1 (Teams, PaymentProfiles, Subscriptions, etc.)\n\nThey have access to Customer 1 and Customer 2\n\nThey have access to all the entities under Customer 1 and Customer 2 (Devices, Endpoints, Groups, etc.)\n\nSystemUser A is not a member of Organization 2\n\nSystemUser A doesn't have access to Workgroup 2\n\nSystemUser A doesn't have access to any entity under Workgroup 2 (Teams, PaymentProfiles, Subscriptions, etc.)\n\nSystemUser A doesn't have access to Customer 3 nor Customer 4\n\nSystemUser A doesn't have access to any entity under Customer 3 nor Customer 4 (Devices, Endpoints, Groups, etc.)\n\nAgents and Teams\n\nAgents\n\nThe following script shows how to retrieve the members of a workgroup, a.k.a agents. You can find more information about agents in the Help Center article View, add, and edit agents.\n\n# This script illustrates how to retrieve agents in a workgroup # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan # Retrieve a workgroup and get a ticket for it $workgroupId = [GUID](Read-Host -Prompt 'Workgroup ID') $workgroup = Get-BT_Workgroup -Ticket $ticket -Id $workgroupId $workgroupTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Ticket $ticket -OrganizationId $workgroup.WorkgroupOrganizationId # Retrieve the IDs of the agents in the workgroup $agentIDs = (Get-BT_OrganizationMember -Ticket $workgroupTicket).SystemUserId Write-Output $agentIDs\n\nTeams\n\nA team is a set of agents who can be assigned to an MSPComplete task or service.\n\nThe following example shows how to manage teams:\n\nTo retrieve the teams of a workgroup, you can use the Get-BT_Team cmdlet and either filter the results on the workgroup organization id, or use a ticket scoped to the workgroup.\n\nTo create a team, you can use the Add-BT_Team cmdlet, with a ticket scoped to the workgroup\n\n# This script illustrates how to manage teams # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan # Retrieve a workgroup and get a ticket for it $workgroupId = [GUID](Read-Host -Prompt 'Workgroup ID') $workgroup = Get-BT_Workgroup -Ticket $ticket -Id $workgroupId $workgroupTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Ticket $ticket -OrganizationId $workgroup.WorkgroupOrganizationId # Retrieve teams in the workgroup $teams = Get-BT_Team -Ticket $workgroupTicket Write-Output $teams # Create a new team under the workgroup $team = Add-BT_Team -Ticket $workgroupTicket -Name \"Test Team\" -AssignmentType LeastLoad Write-Output $team\n\nTeam Members\n\nTo retrieve the members of a team, you can use the Get-BT_TeamMembership cmdlet and filter the results on the team id. The example below shows how to retrieve, add or remove agents from a team:\n\n# This script illustrates how to manage team members # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan # Retrieve a workgroup and get a ticket for it $workgroupId = [GUID](Read-Host -Prompt 'Workgroup ID') $workgroup = Get-BT_Workgroup -Ticket $ticket -Id $workgroupId $workgroupTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Ticket $ticket -OrganizationId $workgroup.WorkgroupOrganizationId # Retrieve a team $team = Get-BT_Team -Ticket $workgroupTicket -Name \"Test Team\" # Retrieve the IDs of the agents in the workgroup $agentIDs = (Get-BT_OrganizationMember -Ticket $workgroupTicket).SystemUserId # Add one agent to the team $newTeamMember = Add-BT_TeamMembership -Ticket $workgroupTicket -TeamId $team.Id -SystemUserId $agentIDs[0] # Retrieve the team members $teamMembers = Get-BT_TeamMembership -Ticket $ticket -TeamId $team.Id Write-Output $teamMembers # Remove the agent from the team Remove-BT_TeamMembership -Ticket $workgroupTicket -Id $newTeamMember.Id\n\nEndpoints, End Users and Subscriptions\n\nEndpoints\n\nAn endpoint encapsulates connection information and credentials to allow MSPComplete to connect to an external server or service. More information about endpoints can be found in the Help Center article View, add, and edit customer endpoints . The script in the following example shows how to create an endpoint under a customer.\n\n# This script illustrates how to create an endpoint # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan # Retrieve a customer and get a ticket for it $customerId = [GUID](Read-Host -Prompt 'Customer ID') $customer = Get-BT_Customer -Ticket $ticket -Id $customerId $customerTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Ticket $ticket -OrganizationId $customer.OrganizationId # Initialize a configuration (in this case an Exchange configuration) $endpointConfiguraton = New-BT_ExchangeConfiguration -AdministrativeUsername \"TestUserName\" -AdministrativePassword \"TestPassword\" -UseAdministrativeCredentials $True -ExchangeItemType Mail # Create a new endpoint $endpoint = Add-BT_Endpoint -Ticket $customerTicket -Configuration $endpointConfiguraton -Type ExchangeOnline2 -Name \"Test Endpoint\" Write-Output $endpoint\n\nEnd Users\n\nAn end user, also referred to as \"user\", is an employee of one of your customers. The following example shows how to manage end users:\n\nTo retrieve the end users of a customer, you can use the Get-BT_CustomerEndUser cmdlet and either filter the results on the customer organization id, or use a ticket scoped to this customer.\n\nTo create an end user, you can use the Add-BT_CustomerEndUser cmdlet, with a ticket scoped to the customer.\n\n# This script illustrates how to manage customer end users # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan # Retrieve a customer and get a ticket for it $customerId = [GUID](Read-Host -Prompt 'Customer ID') $customer = Get-BT_Customer -Ticket $ticket -Id $customerId $customerTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Ticket $ticket -OrganizationId $customer.OrganizationId # Create a new end user under that customer $newEndUser = Add-BT_CustomerEndUser -Ticket $customerTicket -PrimaryEmailAddress \"user@test.com\" -FirstName John -LastName Smith Write-Output $newEndUser # Retrieve the end users under that customer $endUsers = Get-BT_CustomerEndUser -Ticket $customerTicket Write-Output $endUsers\n\nSubscriptions\n\nA subscription represents a user subscription that is required to run MSPComplete services for this user. For more information about subscriptions, see the Help Center article Subscription and licensing FAQ .\n\nThe script that follows shows how to retrieve and assign subscriptions to end users.\n\n# This script shows how to assign subscriptions to customer end users # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential -Message \"Enter BitTitan credentials\" $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan # Retrieve a customer and its workgroup $customerId = [GUID](Read-Host -Prompt 'Customer ID') $customer = Get-BT_Customer -Ticket $ticket -Id $customerId $workgroup = Get-BT_Workgroup -Ticket $ticket -Id $customer.WorkgroupId # Initialize additional tickets $customerTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Ticket $ticket -OrganizationId $customer.OrganizationId $workgroupTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Ticket $ticket -OrganizationId $workgroup.WorkgroupOrganizationId # Get the end users under that customer (this example retrieves the top 100) $customerEndUsers = Get-BT_CustomerEndUser -Ticket $customerTicket -IsDeleted $False -PageSize 100 if ( $customerEndUsers ) { # Check for existing subscriptions $existingSubscriptions = Get-BT_Subscription -Ticket $workgroupTicket -ReferenceEntityType CustomerEndUser -ReferenceEntityId $customerEndUsers.Id -IsDeleted $False # Filter out end users who already have a subscription $customerEndUsersToSubscribe = $customerEndUsers | Where { $existingSubscriptions.ReferenceEntityId -notcontains $_.Id } # Get the product sku id for the MSPC yearly subscription $productSkuId = Get-BT_ProductSkuId -Ticket $ticket -ProductName MspcEndUserYearlySubscription # Assign subscriptions to each customer end user $customerEndUsersToSubscribe | ForEach { Add-BT_Subscription -Ticket $workgroupTicket -ReferenceEntityType CustomerEndUser -ReferenceEntityId $_.Id -ProductSkuId $productSkuId } $assignedSubscriptionCount = $customerEndUsersToSubscribe.Length Write-Verbose \"Successfully assigned subscription to $assignedSubscriptionCount end users.\" }\n\nExtended properties\n\nMSPComplete allows agents to set their own custom properties (a.k.a extended properties) on entities. Custom properties are included automatically when records are retrieved using the BitTitan SDK.\n\nThe following is an example of how to manage extended properties on entities:\n\n# This script illustrates how to manage extended properties on entities # Extended properties can be added to various entities. Examples include 'Customer', 'CustomerDevice' and 'CustomerEndUser'. # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential -Message \"Enter BitTitan credentials\" $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan # Retrieve a customer $customer = Get-BT_Customer -Ticket $ticket -CompanyName \"Default\" $customerTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Ticket $ticket -OrganizationId $customer.OrganizationId # Add two extended properties to this customer $customer.ExtendedProperties.SomeProperty = 'SomeValue' $customer.ExtendedProperties.AnotherProperty = 'AnotherValue' $customer = Set-BT_Customer -customer $customer -Ticket $customerTicket # Lookup the current extended properties Write-Output \"The customer has the following custom properties:\" $customer.ExtendedProperties Write-Output \"The value of the custom property with name 'SomeProperty' is '$($customer.ExtendedProperties.SomeProperty)'.\" # Update one extended property, delete the other one $customer.ExtendedProperties.SomeProperty = 'SomeNewValue' $customer.ExtendedProperties.Remove('AnotherProperty') $customer = Set-BT_Customer -customer $customer -Ticket $customerTicket # Lookup the updated extended properties again Write-Output \"The customer now has the following custom properties:\" $customer.ExtendedProperties\n\nOther entities\n\nFeeds\n\nA feed represents notification pertaining to your customersâ service activities and changes. There are two feeds available in the platform: a personal feed and a customer feed. For more information about feeds, see the Help Center article MSPComplete feeds and notifications .\n\nThere are two different types of entities for feeds:\n\nThe metadata, called FeedMetadata, which contains information about the feed, such as the name and type of feed.\n\nThe instance, called FeedInstance, which contains information about one of your instantiations of the feed, such as the content of the feed and the event date.\n\nTo retrieve the list of feed instances, use the Get-BT_FeedInstance cmdlet, as shown in the example below:\n\n# This script illustrates how to retrieve feeds for a given workgroup # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential # Initialize variables $workgroupId = [GUID](Read-Host -Prompt 'Workgroup ID') # Retrieve the top 10 most recent feeds under the workgroup $ticketWithWorkgroupId = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan -WorkgroupId $workgroupId $feedInstances = Get-BT_FeedInstance -Ticket $ticketWithWorkgroupId -PageSize 10 -SortBy_Created_Descending # Retrieve the corresponding feed metadata $feedMetadata = Get-BT_FeedMetadata -Ticket $ticketWithWorkgroupId -Id $feedInstances.FeedMetadataId # Display the feeds ForEach ($feedInstance in $feedInstances) { # Retrieve the metadata of the current feed instance $metadata = $feedMetadata | Where { $feedInstance.FeedMetadataId -eq $_.Id } # Display the feed keyname and parameters $parameterStrings = @() For ($i=0; $i -lt $feedInstance.Parameters.Length; $i++) { $parameterStrings += \"$($feedInstance.Parameters[$i].Name)=$($feedInstance.Parameters[$i].Value)\" } Write-Output \"$($feedInstance.EventDate) - $($metadata.KeyName): $([string]::Join(\", \", $parameterStrings))\" }\n\nReports\n\nA report represents a snapshots of current state of your business and helps you track it over time. For more information about reports, see the Help Center article View and add workgroup reports .\n\nTo retrieve a generated report, you need to be the administrator of the workgroup. Use the Get-BT_ReportInstance cmdlet to list the reports and then use Get-BT_ReportWithData to get the data for a specific report.\n\nThe example below shows how to retrieve a report and its data:\n\n# This script illustrates how to retrieve report data # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan # Retrieve a workgroup and get a ticket for it $workgroupId = [GUID](Read-Host -Prompt 'Workgroup ID') $workgroup = Get-BT_Workgroup -Ticket $ticket -Id $workgroupId $workgroupTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Ticket $ticket -OrganizationId $workgroup.WorkgroupOrganizationId # Retrieve the last generated report and its data. $reportInstance = Get-BT_ReportInstance -Ticket $workgroupTicket -PageSize 1 -SortBy_GeneratedOn_Descending $reportWithData = Get-BT_ReportWithData -Ticket $workgroupTicket -ReportInstanceId $reportInstance.Id Write-Output $reportWithData\n\nServices and Tasks\n\nOverview\n\nThis section illustrates how to run MSPComplete services and simulate user inputs using BitTitan cmdlets. To understand the main MSPComplete concepts, we advise you to read the \"MSPComplete concepts\" section first.\n\nKey Terminology\n\nInstructional task: represents an MSPComplete task that only contains instructions and images. Also known as a manual or prescriptive guidance task\n\nInput task: represents an MSPComplete task that asks the user for some input information. Input tasks can contain instructions and images\n\nValidation task: represents an MSPComplete task that validates the user input information\n\nConfirmation task: represents an MSPComplete task that asks the user to confirm the input information\n\nProcessing parent task: represents an MSPComplete task associated with one or multiple background jobs. The background jobs will start running once the task has been started.\n\nProcessing child task: represents an MSPComplete sub-task associated with a unique background job.\n\nProperty bag: represents a set of text input information (for example, email address, mailbox size)\n\nReference: represents some input information referencing data available in MSPComplete (for example, endpoints or end users)\n\nTask target: represents an association between a task instance and a reference, a property bag, or another task instance\n\nConcepts\n\nServices\n\nA service represents an IT service you can deliver to your customers with MSPComplete. A service is divided into tasks. For more information about services and tasks, see the Help Center article Introduction to services and tasks.\n\nThere are two types of entities for services:\n\nThe service metadata, called OfferingMetadata, which contains information about the service, such as the vendor and keywords\n\nThe service instance, called OfferingInstance, which contains information about one of your executions of the service, such as the execution status and the customer organization id\n\nTo retrieve the details of a service, use the Get-BT_OfferingMetadata cmdlet.\n\n$credentials = Get-Credential $btTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $credentials -ServiceType BitTitan $offeringMetadata = Get-BT_OfferingMetadata -Ticket $btTicket -Name \"Assess Azure ROI\"\n\nTo retrieve the list of existing instances of the services, you can use the Get-BT_OfferingInstance cmdlet.\n\n$credentials = Get-Credential $btTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $credentials -ServiceType BitTitan $offeringInstances = Get-BT_OfferingInstance -Ticket $btTicket\n\nThe section below describes how to deploy a Service.\n\nTasks\n\nA task represents an IT task, a single step in a service, which belongs to an IT service that you can launch from MSPComplete.\n\nThere are two different types of entities for tasks:\n\nThe task metadata, called TaskMetadata, which contains information about the task, such as the name and the type of the task\n\nThe task instance, called TaskInstance, which contains information about one of your executions of the task, such as the execution status and the customer organization id\n\nTo retrieve the list of tasks associated to a service, use the Get-BT_OfferingMetadataToTaskMetadata cmdlet. Once you have the task metadata ids, you can retrieve the details of the tasks using the Get-BT_TaskMetadata cmdlet.\n\n$credentials = Get-Credential $btTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $credentials -ServiceType BitTitan $offeringMetadata = Get-BT_OfferingMetadata -Ticket $btTicket -Name \"Assess Azure ROI\" $offeringMetadataToTaskMetadataEntities = Get-BT_OfferingMetadataToTaskMetadata -Ticket $btTicket -OfferingMetadataId $offeringMetadata.Id -SortBy_TaskDefaultExecutionOrder_Ascending $taskMetadataEntities = New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList foreach ($offeringMetadataToTaskMetadata in $offeringMetadataToTaskMetadataEntities) { $taskMetadata = Get-BT_TaskMetadata -Ticket $btTicket -Id $offeringMetadataToTaskMetadata.TaskMetadataId $taskMetadataEntities.Add($taskMetadata) }\n\nTo retrieve the list of existing instances of the tasks belonging to a given service, use the Get-BT_TaskInstance cmdlet.\n\n$credentials = Get-Credential $btTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $credentials -ServiceType BitTitan $offeringMetadata = Get-BT_OfferingMetadata -Ticket $btTicket -Name \"Assess Azure ROI\" $offeringInstances = Get-BT_OfferingInstance -Ticket $btTicket -OfferingMetadataId $offeringMetadata.Id $taskInstanceEntities = Get-BT_TaskInstance -Ticket $btTicket -OfferingInstanceId $offeringInstances[0].Id -SortBy_ExecutionOrder_Ascending\n\nProperty Bags\n\nA property bag represents a set of text input information (e.g. email address, mailbox size).\n\nYou can retrieve the list of property bags with the Get-BT_PropertyBag cmdlet.\n\n$credentials = Get-Credential $btTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $credentials -ServiceType BitTitan $propertyBags = Get-BT_PropertyBag -Ticket $btTicket\n\nThe section below shows an example of how to create a property bag when executing an input task programmatically.\n\nTask Targets\n\nA task target represents an association between a task instance and a reference, a property bag, or another task instance.\n\nYou can retrieve the list of task targets using the Get-BT_TaskTarget cmdlet.\n\n$credentials = Get-Credential $btTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $credentials -ServiceType BitTitan $taskTargets = Get-BT_TaskTarget -Ticket $btTicket\n\nThe section below shows an example of how to create a task target when executing an input task programmatically.\n\nDeploying a Service\n\nTo deploy a service, you simply instantiate a service instance with a ticket scoped to a customer and the Add-BT_OfferingInstance cmdlet.\n\n# This script shows how to deploy a runbook to a customer # Authenticate $creds = Get-Credential -Message \"Enter BitTitan credentials\" $ticket = Get-BT_Ticket -Credentials $creds -ServiceType BitTitan # Initialize variables $offeringMetadataId = [GUID](Read-Host -Prompt 'Runbook ID') $customerId = [GUID](Read-Host -Prompt 'Customer ID') # Retrieve the customer to deploy the runbook to # And get a ticket for it $customer = Get-BT_Customer -Ticket $ticket -Id $customerId $customerTicket = Get-BT_Ticket -Ticket $ticket -OrganizationId $customer.OrganizationId # Deploy the runbook Add-BT_OfferingInstance -Ticket $customerTicket -OfferingMetadataId $offeringMetadataId Write-Verbose \"Deployed runbook: $offeringMetadataId to customer: $($customer.CompanyName).\"\n\nOnce the MSPComplete service has been deployed, the following entities have been created:\n\nEach instructional, input, validation, and processing parent task is created.\n\nA processing task can depend on one or multiple input tasks. For each dependency, a task target associating the processing parent task instance and the input task instance is created.\n\nExecuting the input Tasks\n\nTo execute an input task, select the input, then complete the task. To select the input, use one of the two cmdlets:\n\nAdd-BT_TaskTarget cmdlet to select a reference as an input\n\nAdd-BT_PropertyBag cmdlet to create a text input\n\nOnce the input has been selected, you can use the Complete-BT_TaskInstance cmdlet to complete the input task and go to the next task.\n\n# This script follows the previous script (Add-BT_OfferingInstance cmdlet script) $taskInstances = Get-BT_TaskInstance -Ticket $customerTicket -OfferingInstanceId $offeringInstance.Id -SortBy_ExecutionOrder_Ascending # Execute the endpoint input task $endpoints = Get-BT_Endpoint -Ticket $customerTicket $endpointTaskTarget = Add-BT_TaskTarget -Ticket $customerTicket -ReferenceEntityType \"Endpoint\" -ReferenceEntityId $endpoints[0].Id -TaskInstanceId $taskInstances[0].Id Complete-BT_TaskInstance -Ticket $customerTicket -TaskInstanceId $taskInstances[0].Id # Execute the user input task $groupMembers = Get-BT_GroupMembership -Ticket $customerTicket -GroupId $endpoints[0].GroupId $endUsers = Get-BT_CustomerEndUser -Ticket $customerTicket -Id $groupMembers.EndUserId -SubscriptionType \"ne None\" $endUserTaskTarget = Add-BT_TaskTarget -Ticket $customerTicket -ReferenceEntityType \"CustomerEndUser\" -ReferenceEntityId $endUsers[0].Id -TaskInstanceId $taskInstances[1].Id Complete-BT_TaskInstance -Ticket $customerTicket -TaskInstanceId $taskInstances[1].Id # Execute the proxy email address input task $emailProperty = New-Object -TypeName ManagementProxy.ManagementService.PropertyString $emailProperty.Value = \"alias@company.com\" $emailProperty.Name = \"ProxyEmailAddress\" $properties = @($emailProperty) $propertyBag = Add-BT_PropertyBag -Ticket $customerTicket -Properties $properties -ReferenceEntityType \"TaskInstance\" -ReferenceEntityId $taskInstances[2].Id Complete-BT_TaskInstance -Ticket $customerTicket -TaskInstanceId $taskInstances[2].Id\n\nOnce the input tasks have been executed, the following entities have been created:\n\nNote that each input task is associated with either a property bag or a reference via a task target.\n\nExecuting the processing Task\n\nTo execute a processing task, use the Complete-BT_TaskInstance cmdlet once the input tasks have been executed:\n\n# This script follows the previous script (Complete-BT_TaskInstance cmdlet script for input tasks) Complete-BT_TaskInstance -Ticket $customerTicket -TaskInstanceId $taskInstances[3].Id\n\nOnce the processing task has been executed, the following entities have been created:\n\nA processing child task is created for each background job. The AddProxyOffice365 cmdlet from our example requires one background job per user while other processing parent tasks only require a unique background job.\n\nOne task target is created for each input task and is associated with either a reference or a property bag. Most of the task targets are associated with the processing parent task but some task targets might be associated with the processing children tasks when the data is only relevant to a particular child task (for example, one end user).\n\nExporting / Importing a Service\n\nThe SDK can be used to export/import a service to/from a ZIP file.

If you send an email, you may get a reply  3-4 days later with weblinks that we have already read. \n\nHere is our issue. We have no problem creating the Project in BitTitan for GSuite email to Office 365 migration. It works as advertised. \n\nIf we create a New Project  for Documents (GDrive to OneDrive), we do not have an option to select Google Drive (Own Service Account), upload a JSON file and enter Super Admin credentials. We can only select Google Drive, then One Drive (Destination) and Advanced Options. Because of this, it will fail validation.\n\nThanks in advance\n\n## Comment ID i77g43s with +14 score by [(yothhedgedigger, Reddit, 2022-05-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/uhp9r0/bittitan_support_is_a_mess_need_insight_on/i77g43s/) (in reply to ID uhp9r0):\nI'm sorry I don't have an answer, but I did want to confirm that support is almost nonexistent there now.

Single domain, exchange mailboxes to a new 365 tenant for example, almost 100% self serve via their portal, not likely to be an issue.

      "# Post ID 5r7lcv: Burned by BitTitan, need new ideas for O365 Migrations with +11 score by [(tommucha, Reddit, 2017-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5r7lcv/burned_by_bittitan_need_new_ideas_for_o365/)\n**TL;DR - DeploymentPro is broken on the back end, what else do people use for Outlook profile migrations, either standalone or a full migration product?**\n\nWe've used SkyKick before and for more than double the price of BitTitan, I wasn't happy with what it does.  Any other 3rd party tools out there that at least can do Outlook profile migrations?  I'm going to look more into the minimal hybrid option and use MRS moves, but documentation is very limited on the new minimal hybrid so I need to lab it out with some MS Partner hours to help.  While the minimal hybrid may be my answer, it won't be a fit for all projects.  \n.\n\nThe story below:\n\nWe've used the BitTitan family of products for 20 or so Office 365 migrations so we're fairly comfortable with the software. On our last project, DeploymentPro left us standing there with having to manually configure 100 Outlook profiles.  If you don't know what DeploymentPro is, it reconfigures Outlook profiles on the desktop, saving lots of time in a migration.\n\nYesterday was cutover day.  MigrationWiz worked fine, but DeploymentPro was throwing errors on the client side and the management website.  Check the status page - Degraded Performance for DeploymentPro with no other details.\n\nWith no phone number to call to talk to a person, we start a chat.  Can't help in chat, someone will followup in 24-48hrs.  After letting that soak in, we shelled out the $250  to get someone on the phone only to find out there is a known issue with the SQL server used for DepoymentPro losing connectivity/going offline and there is no ETA on the fix.  If it's not back up, they'll refund the money for DeploymentPro, and hopefully the $250 premium support.  I'm not going to rant about the practice of leaving something that's broken in production, that's reserved for a cold beer at the pub.\n\nSo now its a mad rush to configure 100 PCs over 3 locations.  It happens, suck it up and get the job done.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID dd5uxnt with +10 score by [(bittitansupport, Reddit, 2017-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5r7lcv/burned_by_bittitan_need_new_ideas_for_o365/dd5uxnt/) (in reply to ID 5r7lcv):\nHi Tom, Dominic with BitTitan Support.\n\nFirst of all, I'm terribly sorry you had a bad experience using DeploymentPro and had to manually reconfigure ~100 desktops.\n\nYour money will be 100% promptly refunded. Regarding premium phone support licenses, we always refund those if the issue is on our end of things (which is the case here).\n\nOur investigation showed the following:\n\t1. You are using the legacy version of Deployment Pro (https://community.bittitan.com/partners/Pages/Partner%20Portal/Miscellaneous/DeploymentPro.aspx).\n\t2. We recommend switching to the new version for future projects (http://blog.bittitan.com/preview-snazzy-new-deploymentpro) - see benefits.\n\t3. We acknowledge and understand the root cause of the issue you experienced. It is related to a Microsoft SQL performance issue. We've contacted the vendor (Microsoft) and posted a notification as soon as we were aware of the issue (http://status.bittitan.com).\n\nIn addition to your full refund, we've also deposited 25 free Deployment Pro licenses to your account.\n\nAgain, we're sorry about the inconvenience and are confident you will have an improved experience using new version of Deployment Pro.\n\n### Comment ID dd6bst3 with +2 score by [(emeffinsteve, Reddit, 2017-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5r7lcv/burned_by_bittitan_need_new_ideas_for_o365/dd6bst3/) (in reply to ID dd5uxnt):\nI've got a potential project migrating 14 mailboxes from one Office 365 account to another.

It was for the new version using DMA, not the legacy one. I was migrating 300 users from Exchange hosted to Office 365. Testing on a couple of machines went perfectly.\n\nFirst, the DMA agent used up all of the available drive space on every workstation. The agent had a bug that kept generating new log files. That was a major problem that we had to deal with. I called BitTitan support and they told us to delete the log files and told me they were knew about the bug and were working on an update that would get automatically pushed down to the workstations when it was available.\n\nSecond, the new updated DMA agent that BitTitan released that night to fix the bug, was never reporting back to the BitTitan DMA servers. We had no idea because you have to look in a different area of the portal to see this info. The DeploymentPro console showed the agent successfully installed but under they only show the last heartbeat received under the DMA console. Very confusing and unintuitive interface.\n\nThird, we had a made a change to the naming convention for our Office 365 users after this MigrationWiz/BitTitan project was created. Support showed me how to change the destination address in the DeploymentPro console for each user, manually. But when you made the change it was never reflected in the console. It continues to show the previous name. Support told me that is a bug in the interface but he was sure thru his testing that the backend was successfully updated. And because it did not reflect the proper destination name after making the change, I had to schedule the agent to run instead of kicking it off when I was ready. Not ideal in this situation.\n\nNo fast forward a couple of days to the day of the cutover and all of these bugs made for the perfect storm for my customer. The schedule never started on half of the machines and on the other half the agent would hang and never continue. We had about an 80% failure rate.\n\nIt turns out that the new updated agent never checked in to the BitTitan servers so it never received the updated destination name or the schedule that I set. Support said we would have to wait 24 hours for a call back. I checked with support again an hour later when we were getting no where with our efforts to get Outlook working again. I was told this time that we could pay $250 for priority phone support. By the time we got support we needed and got to the root of the problem it was too little, too late. The whole day was shot. We got everyone back online after visiting most workstations but many of them did not get their nickname cache or their rules migrated over.\n\nI believe the customer was able to get a refund from BitTitan for DeploymentPro but the product really killed us and I would not feel comfortable using it again in the future.\n\n### Comment ID dd9f8fa with +2 score by [(tommucha, Reddit, 2017-02-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5r7lcv/burned_by_bittitan_need_new_ideas_for_o365/dd9f8fa/) (in reply to ID dd8tksx):\nWow that doesn't sound like a good time, thanks for sharing your story.

Hopefully next time I use it they have worked the bugs out and I will also know better what to keep an eye on.\n\nThat was about a month ago and I haven't had a need for a 3rd party migration tool like that since. Friends of mine have used Skykick and love it but it is more expensive. Skykick does everything for you. It is especially good for an Office 365 tenant to tenant migration because it will deprovision the domain from the old tenant and add it to the new tenant for you. I have also heard good things about a product called Cloud Migrator 365 or something like that but haven't seen it myself yet.\n\n## Comment ID l0vrke4 with +1 score by [(Awkward_Baseball4564, Reddit, 2024-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5r7lcv/burned_by_bittitan_need_new_ideas_for_o365/l0vrke4/) (in reply to ID 5r7lcv):\nAVOID AT ALL COST!

      "# Post ID 1ebzo7d: BitTitan/MigrationWiz is broken; no public comment and no refund. with +31 score by [(L0ngpants, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ebzo7d/bittitanmigrationwiz_is_broken_no_public_comment/)\nIn the same vein as Intel's recent behavior being hush-hush about defects until public backlash, BitTitan is covering up massive problems with their Gmail API integration.\n\nEDIT: for clarity, Google Workspace is the destination in this case. It is a Workspace->Workspace migration.\n\nI had to fight tooth-and-nail to force them to investigate far enough to recognize the issue is on their end. They admitted it was their problem and their dev team was engaged in working on a fix, but that has gone on for 60 days now. Despite insisting several times, they refuse to provide any timeline.\n\nHere are the main points underlining their unacceptable response to this issue:\n\n1. They flippantly suggest switching to imap, but \"note that this will duplicate content\". They're joking, right? They know that clients won't be happy with this and a massive amount of effort will go into cleaning out the old content to start fresh.\n2. They're dragging their feet and taking no responsibility. Any org worth their salt would have proactively offered a refund before we reached 60 days of no resolution.\n3. They refuse a refund. The \"Technical Support Manager for US Region\" (and now the \"head of support for the whole org\") themselves stated \"refunding the license is not possible because I could see that you have already migrated some data\". Can't make this stuff up, folks.\n4. Licenses are still on sale, with no warning posted on product page; no warning at checkout; no warning during project setup; no warning on blog, website, support site, or status dashboard. They do not care that their product is broken, and that many others will spin up projects only to get half way through before discovering this disaster; I'm sure they will be refused refunds, as well.\n\nIt has been a long time coming with MigrationWiz, but I think this is the last straw. I cannot in good faith ever recommend this product again. It has consistently gone down-hill year after year.\n\nAMA, leave your condolences, or let me know what alternatives you're liking better. I'm going to be trying AvePoint Fly shortly. It's going to be an annoying few weeks while I clean this mess up.\n\nUPDATE: supposedly my ticket made it to the head of support across the whole org. Still refusing refund. Apologized for the frustration but still offered no timeline or commitment to resolution. Offered me 2x the licenses in lieu of the refund... totally tone deaf. What am I going to do with free licenses for a product I can't trust?\n\n  \nUPDATE 2: they replied to my ticket to let me know that a status message is now posted on their status dashboard here [https://status.bittitan.com/](https://status.bittitan.com/) . Unfortunately, they knew about this issue for at least 60 days but have only begun showing this message now. I can confirm that I checked this status page prior to writing this post.\n\n## Comment ID lewbh8u with +27 score by [(BawdyLotion, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ebzo7d/bittitanmigrationwiz_is_broken_no_public_comment/lewbh8u/) (in reply to ID 1ebzo7d):\nSorry it's my fault.\n\nEvery time I've used BitTitan they have an outage the day I go to use it.\n\nI had the start of a gsuite to 365 migration meeting scheduled literally 5 minutes from now that I was planning to use BitTitan for.

However, recently I had one user complain that his entire 2020 year of his calendar was missing. I reported this to MigrationWiz, who recommended I reset statistics and run a full migration again. This time, it found more than 6000 items that were missed the first time. So, I reset statistics again, and ran it again, and it found hundreds of items missed. I had zero errors. I would not recommend anyone use this product ever again.\n\nI spent about 2 weeks recently writing a program using AI that helps me migrate mail using Graph API and I have successfully tested it on some test mailboxes. I am not experienced enough to use it for any production environments, but I would love it if someone with actual programming skills can make some competition here. I definitely cannot use an app that is moving hundreds of thousands of emails, and will miss things.\n\nAlso, their documentation is bad. I saw someone saying they have good documentation, but it is definitely not good. I have been in IT for 20 years and was an Exchange tier 7 for many years. I liked the convenience of something like MigrationWiz, but when the mailboxes appear to be the same on both sides, only missing a handful of items in each mailbox, what exactly am I supposed to do when the scan says all the files are the same? I trusted the system too much and became complacent!

I did a prestage migration for everything up to 30 days, and on the day of final migration. I ran the final migration multiple times to be safe. However, recently I had one user complain that his entire 2020 year of his calendar was missing. I reported this to MigrationWiz, who recommended I reset statistics and run a full migration again. This time, it found more than 6000 items that were missed the first time. So, I reset statistics again, and ran it again, and it found hundreds of items missed. I had zero errors. I would not recommend anyone use this product ever again.\n\nI spent about 2 weeks recently writing a program using AI that helps me migrate mail using Graph API and I have successfully tested it on some test mailboxes. I am not experienced enough to use it for any production environments, but I would love it if someone with actual programming skills can make some competition here. I definitely cannot use an app that is moving hundreds of thousands of emails, and will miss things.\n\nAlso, their documentation is bad. I saw someone saying they have good documentation, but it is definitely not good. I have been in IT for 20 years and was an Exchange tier 7 for many years. I liked the convenience of something like MigrationWiz, but when the mailboxes appear to be the same on both sides, only missing a handful of items in each mailbox, what exactly am I supposed to do when the scan says all the files are the same? I trusted the system too much and became complacent! I should have checked the actual number of items, but some of my these users have hundreds of folders, which is wild to say the least.\n\n## Comment ID lljztby with +1 score by [(Tech_saviy, Reddit, 2024-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1d80w5s/dont_use_bittitan_migrationwiz_any_other_good/lljztby/) (in reply to ID 1d80w5s):\nThey have a lot of good videos.

This may be a result of a large number of files, total size of files, depth of folder structure, etc. \n\nWhen you exceed this limit, the copy stops, and the Web UI shows that the job is complete and 100% successful. Subsequent updates fail silently, with no error in the Web UI.\n\nThe only way to discover that you have exceeded this limit is if you have exported the unpublished detail log to an SQL target. Or to check the stats between the old and new sites.\n\nThis means that you may have thousands of files that fail copy or fail to update after your final sync.\n\n**NONE OF THIS IS DOCUMENTED**\n\nTHERE IS NO WARNING\n\nIf you do use BitTitan, be sure to check your site item counts and document size totals to make sure you have copied everything\n\n## Comment ID i3hh2qs with +3 score by [(ekix, Reddit, 2022-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/twqa1c/it_bittitans_support_always_incompetent_or_am_i/i3hh2qs/) (in reply to ID twqa1c):\nI can recommend the built-in Sharepoint Migration Tool it works great for G-suite.\n\nHowever I always prefer to use BitTitan or Skykick when migrating mail.\n\n### Comment ID i3hr4ac with +1 score by [(RipRapRob, Reddit, 2022-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/twqa1c/it_bittitans_support_always_incompetent_or_am_i/i3hr4ac/) (in reply to ID i3hh2qs):\nWe use this all the time, when migrating from a server, but I don't think it supports migrating directly from Google Drive?\n\n#### Comment ID i3j1vhq with +1 score by [(Nordon, Reddit, 2022-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/twqa1c/it_bittitans_support_always_incompetent_or_am_i/i3j1vhq/) (in reply to ID i3hr4ac):\nIt does! Both the built in mail and drive migration clients in the O365 portal work pretty well! The Drive to SP migration is not ideal, but they will take you there!\n\n## Comment ID i3hxscm with +3 score by [(travelingnerd10, Reddit, 2022-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/twqa1c/it_bittitans_support_always_incompetent_or_am_i/i3hxscm/) (in reply to ID twqa1c):\nA while back, Microsoft bought https://mover.io, which supports several cloud sources for documents to move into SharePoint/OneDrive. They list GDrive, Box, Dropbox, Egnyte, Amazon S3, and Google Cloud Storage, amongst others, as sources for transfer. The destination, however, is only a Microsoft-owned one (after all, Microsoft bought this product for a reason).\n\nI honestly cannot recall if the cost is included in your SharePoint subscription, but it is a useful tool.\n\nBitTitan support does suck eggs, though. I did a move over a weekend, and opened a case with high priority on the Friday night at the start of the migration. Crickets.\n\nEnded up resolving / working around the issue on our own. It wasn't until the Tuesday *after* the move when we heard the *first* response from them over email. Maybe there's a paid support option that gets you help faster but this is bordering on ridiculous.\n\nMost of my mail migrations are Exchange Online to Exchange Online, so I'm planning on playing around with the built in migration tools there. They aren't as elegant or simple to use, but I know that I can get faster support for them.\n\n## Comment ID i3kusfg with +2 score by [(chedstrom, Reddit, 2022-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/twqa1c/it_bittitans_support_always_incompetent_or_am_i/i3kusfg/) (in reply to ID twqa1c):\nBitTitan was purcahsed  by a private equity firm last fall. Since then they have outsourced enigneering, helpdesk, and some other areas to overseas.

Ended up using Microsoft's own Migration Tool - https://[redacted]-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/online/AdminHome.aspx#/migration instead (this might include Mover.io tech?), and it worked like a charm.\n\nA big THANK YOU to all of you that tried to help me.

There is no accountability back to upper management.

The CEO is determined and single minded but lacks any leadership instincts or abilities.  He blamed his developers for the failure of his incubation product MSPC even though he would not let the idea fail fast and die after there was no demand. As soon as someone left the company the CEO would waste no time in telling as many current employees as he could that the former employee did not know what they were doing or didn't do something right. Not very professional and not behaviour fitting of someone in the CEO position, let alone any management position.\r\n- Lacks emotional intelligence. Cannot keep his cool or help but yell when he gets upset, which is much of the time. Does not listen, but merely tells so any meeting with the CEO becomes a painful listening experience for you and one in which an actual conversation does not occur. \r\n- Clearly narcissistic. I think he believes he truly knows everything about everything and if he could, he would fire everyone in the company and go back to being a company of one employee.\r\n- Has majority vote in the company",

I'm sorry you didn't have a good experience working for BitTitan, but I'm also not sure how you (as a web developer) ended up working on API integration. \r\n\r\nRegarding web development and the technology stack, we were among the earliest adopters of Ember.js and made a strong bet on the technology when it was in its infancy. For example, our FE team has been attending the Ember conference for the past 2 years. Why? Because we see huge value in making sure we use front-end technology that is both modern and relevant. I also think it's pretty easy for everyone to get to the truth. Login and take a look (right click, view source welcome). You'll find a modern web interface - all built using Ember.js, localizable in multiple languages, based on well-designed REST web services. No heavy API integration there.\r\n\r\nNow, it's absolutely true that our back end team has deep expertise in enterprise API integration. This is not for everyone, but it is what it takes to migrate the world's data, to connect to thousands of systems, or to enable migration of archives worth hundreds of terabytes. However API integration has never been a requirement for FE software engineering at BitTitan.\r\n\r\nFinally, based on similar logic, U-Haul should go bankrupt because \"people barely move to a new home\" (U-Haul is a 4 billion, 18,000 employee company). And while most people who leave a company think of themselves as top talent, the reality is that our attrition is less than a third of the industry's average. Our development team is made of strong developers. It is because of their passion and hard work that BitTitan is growing, and that we're adding value to our customers and our company every day.",

If the company made a mistake terminating your employment, we're confident you will move on to greener pastures (versus spending your spare time posting the same thing over and over again).\r\n\r\nSecond, regarding the fact that &lt;1% of employees are family members of our CEO, it is factually true. However, I am confident that any employee would take offense to the accusation of nepotism. If anything, those 2 people are held to a higher standard, and are well recognized as some of the hardest working employees in the company. I'm sorry, but it's not like building maintenance is a glamorous position!\r\n\r\nFor the record, those are the same people who, when BitTitan was a 4 person company, volunteered their personal time to help paint the walls...

CEO has a reputation for name calling, bullying, and intimidation, and I have personally sat in many meetings that ended with several minutes of shouting and bullying from the CEO. Many key positions are understaffed, because the company pays significantly less than market salary. Employees who do stay are often forced to work long hours to make up for lack of staffing in key areas, such as engineering. Many serious challenges exist for management, and while I emphasize in many cases, ultimately this leads to a poor work environment for most employees and many talented people are unhappy.",

Absolutely, and this happens in any company. Obviously some people just can't deal with a bruised ego...\r\n\r\nAbout being understaffed, this is 100% a side effect of growth. Here at BitTitan, we move fast and have big plans. As a company, our employee count has consistently doubled every year. This alone proves that we're always eager to hire more talented people who meet our bar. In 2017, we'll be doubling our office space once again (moving to downtown Bellevue after reaching almost 100% office capacity).\r\n\r\nRegarding employees being unhappy... I am sorry but employees would not remain at BitTitan if they were unhappy. There are too many interesting opportunities in the area for this. And it turns out that we have a proven, ridiculously low attrition rate for our industry. Not to mention being repeatedly nominated as one of the best company to work for.",

Third, as some have pointed out, I'm sure some of these reviews are reposts under throwaway accounts. \r\n\r\nHere is the reality:\r\nBitTitan continues to dominate its market\r\nBitTitan just won the NextTech Titan in Geekwire, a huge honor",

At this time, our engineering team includes American, Belarusian, British, Canadian, Chinese, French, German, Pakistani, Russian, Singaporean and Spanish nationals. Our culture is naturally diverse because of our two office locations (Seattle and Singapore). Second speed. We've consistently doubled in size every year within our short history. It's impossible to sustain this kind of speed without engineering keeping pace. At the same time, the way we develop new features is probably more organized than the chaos you'd find in a \"typical\" startup. Within the last year, our speed has allowed us to transform from a leader in mailbox migrations to a leader in migration of all types of electronic content, as well as new automation solutions. Third talent. Our retention is several orders of magnitude higher than average for the industry. Our team is definitely not made of \"cheap developers\" but includes a wide spectrum of experience levels (from new college graduates, to senior developers with 20 years of industry experience). Many of our employees graduated at the top of their class, come from top-ranked universities, or had significant levels of responsibilities before joining BitTitan (see employee profiles on LinkedIn). Regarding our compensation package, we use industry surveys to ensure that our compensation matches market expectations. Our package also includes excellent benefits (including unlimited PTO, free health care, free dental, free vision). At the same time, we do believe that stock and performance-based incentives should be important factors in any employee's compensation. Taking everything into account, our compensation packages are most definitely competitive. Finally, profitability is important to us because it keeps us honest. If you want to work for a \"cool\", unprofitable startup, then we're definitely not a good choice.",

Marketing is at the top of this list. \r\n\r\nVery low pay for cloud across the board. \r\n\r\nCEO is egotistical and thinks he can do everything better himself. \r\n\r\n0% of products are fully tested with a QA team so most products fail \r\n\r\nHR begs everyone to fill out contest forms for best company voting. Then send themselves with execs to collect the awards. \r\n\r\nUnlimited PTO is a gimmick to not have to give employees real vacation time but have them always working. Any vacation can be declined  \r\n\r\nDouble standard for HQ employees and remote employees. \r\n\r\nCEO stated he would like to replace the entire several departments staff with robots / automation\r\n\r\nLeadership in remote locations while majority of staff sit in HQ",

The new solution simplifies end users’ ability to transfer identities and organizational unit (OU) structures, including user accounts, groups, and other related objects, from one AD environment to another. This new feature allows IT professionals to not only migrate AD objects, but also easily transition to other workload migrations such as mailboxes or shared files for easier migrations and greater data fidelity.\n\nWith no disruption in work or access during the migration process, end users can now automate migrations within MigrationWiz for a continuous transition of AD data and configurations to a new or existing on-premises AD environment, setting the stage for synchronization to Entra ID, formally known as Azure AD.\n\nAs a cost-effective solution compared to manual migration processes, the MigrationWiz AD migration tool offers minimal downtime so users can access their data as soon as possible. In addition, it provides a seamless migration process that preserves data integrity while reducing the need for manual intervention and reduces the risks of errors.\n\n“When it comes to our migration needs, we need a tool that is reliable, efficient, and practical,” said Mark Rochester, Cloud Architect, The Cloud Geezer YouTube Channel, and Industry Expert. “This new functionality significantly automates the Active Directory migration process for our customers, enabling us to easily provision everything we need for the migration to the new destination. With this new AD migration tool, we can execute even more migrations effectively, helping to meet our business goals and improve user experience for our IT teams.”\n\nMigrationWiz’s new Active Directory migration solution offers several features and capabilities to end users, including:\n\nAutomatic discovery and migration of AD objects, including users, groups, and sub-OUs.\n\nPassword synchronization between the old and new AD environments for a seamless user experience.\n\nReal-time progress tracking that allows administrators to monitor migration status and identify issues or errors.\n\nAdvanced mapping and filtering for administrators to map source and target AD objects and filter out unwanted data.\n\nIntegration with other MigrationWiz tools that migrate Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive for a comprehensive migration solution. Users migrated through the tool are automatically set up for a mailbox or document project if needed.\n\n“As mergers, acquisitions, and cloud consolidation persist, the demand for migration solutions continues to grow, compelling companies to seek reliable tools to effortlessly streamline these processes and accommodate diverse migration needs,” said Shane Daugherty, Manager, Technical Services Specialist Team at BitTitan. “Our new advanced solution enables IT professionals to complete Active Directory migrations without headaches or stress. MigrationWiz AD Migration provides the ability to complete Microsoft 365 migration projects with one single tool, automating the process while improving end results and user experience.”\n\nThe Active Directory migration license is priced per user and is an efficient first step to migrating mailboxes and OneDrive with BitTitan’s User Migration Bundle (UMB). For more information about MigrationWiz, available licenses, and pricing, please visit BitTitan.com.\n\nAbout BitTitan\n\nBitTitan® empowers IT service professionals to successfully deploy and manage cloud technologies through automation.

      "# [BitTitan T2T Migration Without MPN ID by techcommunity.microsoft.com, user-id](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365/bittitan-t2t-migration-without-mpn-id/td-p/4140152)\nHello Community. I am trying to migrate a handful of users from an M365 tenant with a custom domain, to another M365 tenant without a custom domain. After migration we'll release the domain from tenant A and pick it up in tenant B. In other words, we want to keep the domain from the source and apply it to the target. I am getting errors with BitTitan setting up the project.\n\nIt is a generic error that tells me to contact support, which I did and opened a ticket. While I'm waiting, wanted to see if the community has any experience with this type of migration. I see a warning in the application settings in Azure and wondered if it's relevant. Does anyone know if BitTitan MigrationWiz works with onmicrosoft.com email domain (no MPN ID)?\n\nThe BitTitan error.\n\nMany thanks for sharing any experience you have in this topic.",

      "# [Nine factors to consider when choosing Google Workspace by Nabeel Mukhtar on 2024-01-16](https://itbrief.com.au/story/nine-factors-to-consider-when-choosing-google-workspace)\nShould an organisation move to Google Workspace? Maybe. The answer should be based on an evaluation of multiple factors specific to how the organisation does business. It's not an easy yes or no.\n\nWhat is easy is how to get there, and the answer is via a dedicated migration app.\n\nMore than mail and calendars, Google Workspace boosts cloud collaboration with tools for messaging and meetings; multiple options for creating, storing and sharing work; and ways to unleash a team's creativity with presentations and collaborative whiteboards.\n\nWhile Microsoft 365 has long held major mind space when it comes to business productivity platforms, Google Workspace is a favourite solution for many organisations.\n\nSo how do you choose?\n\nThere's no definitive answer when it comes to deciding which platform is right for any business. The choice should be based on a thoughtful analysis of the current and future needs of your organisation.\n\nIt can be tempting to simply compare Google Workspace pricing and cloud storage with what Microsoft offers. But don't stop there. Consider the following questions in the analysis:\n\nWhat fits the size of an organization? Don't buy a solution that's outsized for its needs, but don't think too small if it's a growing organisation. It probably won't make sense to use a free version long-term, especially because it doesn't come with human support.\n\nHow do the people work? Are they more solitary, or is daily collaboration fundamental to business success? If collaboration is a must, be sure the chosen platform provides lots of options to interact, brainstorm, share and document ideas.\n\nWhere are the people located? A cloud solution like Google Workspace makes remote teamwork easy, even across time zones and geographies.\n\nWhat is the team used to? A productivity platform that's intuitive and easy to adopt saves time and frustration. An organisation may find that many of its employees use Google tools in their personal lives, or became familiar with them in school.\n\nAre certain features important to the business model? For example, if a team needs to conduct webinars, multimedia presentations, or interactive brainstorming sessions easily, these will become decision drivers. On the other hand, look carefully at features that only seem 'nice to have'.\n\nDo you need to integrate third-party tools? While Google Workspace includes an impressive array of tools, most organisations have a few specialised applications as well. Be sure to choose the platform that plays well with third-party integrations.\n\nWhat do the clients or vendors use? While this shouldn't be the top reason for choosing Google versus Microsoft, having compatible platforms can remove friction in client and vendor relationships.\n\nWhy are you changing platforms? Some IT environments have evolved into a patchwork of tools over time. Others have divisions using different platforms after a merger or acquisition.\n\nIt may be tempting to choose the platform that's been around the longest, or the one used at headquarters, but it's worth doing a deeper analysis to match the platform with today's needs.\n\nAre there any dealbreakers? Put the organisation's must-haves at the top of the list and research how their preferred solutions do on those items. This will save a lot of headaches (and complaints) in the long run.\n\nSo, do the analysis, then make the move. Take time to compare the benefits each productivity platform being considered. With Google Workspace, organisations can add a lot of checks in the 'yes' column. Just be sure to match those features with current and future needs.\n\nIt may take a little more time to complete a thorough analysis, but your migration will happen quickly when you use a specialist migration app such as my own company's.\n\nSeek a tool that makes cross-platform migrations easy, whether moving to the cloud or between cloud tenants. Learn more about migrating to Google Workspace or contact us for help setting up the migration project. If you're ready to migrate, check the available licences.\n\nAs a is a technical pre-sales specialist at BitTitan the author, Nabeel Mukhtar, specialises in data migration across Office 365, Google environments and other platforms.\n\nWith a background in managing SaaS tools and native migration solutions, he navigates tenant-to-tenant transitions expertly, ensuring seamless integration for clients.

      "# [Software-Focused Growth Equity](https://tvccapital.com/)\n“When we went looking for an investment partner, I wasn’t interested in having another boss. We were seeking a partner who would leverage their expertise to improve our company’s bottom line. For BitTitan, TVC is more than an investor. They understand that running and growing a company is hard and their advice enables our success as we navigate uncharted territories. The team at TVC is always accessible for anything we need. We consider TVC a trusted business partner.”\n\n“Throughout the lifecycle of the investment, TVC was a great partner for me as CEO and for the business itself. Their operating experience provided great insights and enabled us to better plan, measure, and grow the business to achieve a significant increase in valuation.”\n\n“Partnering with TVC Capital was game-changing for Limeade. They provide real operating insights in ways most venture investors can’t. Every day, they put their reputation, connections and experience to work for us — whether we ask or not. They are investors, but also friends and mentors.”\n\n“I’ve had the good fortune of working with TVC Capital twice as a CEO. During my first experience working with TVC Capital, they represented our first and only institutional capital and, over the course of five years, they proved essential in helping us execute on our business plan and ultimately exit the company successfully with a sale to Polycom in 2011. When I joined MediaPlatform as CEO in 2015, TVC Capital was the first prospective investor I approached and, thankfully, we’re working together again. Over the 10+ years I’ve worked with them, their capabilities continue to get more and more impressive, but they still maintain a critical level of accessibility and involvement of a trusted partner.”\n\n“TVC Capital is not just an investor, they are a trusted partner. TVC consistently provides useful guidance and is always available to provide direct feedback on an approach. They deliver a sense of ‘patient urgency’ in our interactions bringing a healthy blend of experience from real challenges and encouraging push for accomplishments. ReverseVision is my second firm with TVC as an investor. Given all the options available, this second round indicates how highly valued the relationship has become. I would not hesitate to participate with them again in the future.”"

The company has successfully migrated over 19 million users to the cloud for 43,000 customers across 187 countries, supporting major cloud ecosystems including Microsoft, Google, and Dropbox [(Garg, 2024-04-02)](https://get.bittitan.com/blog/bittitan-news/bittitan-launches-migrationwiz-active-directory-migration-solution/). BitTitan's flagship product, MigrationWiz, is recognized as the industry-leading SaaS solution for various types of data migrations, including mailboxes, documents, and Microsoft Teams [(Cary, 2024-06-05)](https://get.bittitan.com/blog/bittitan-news/bittitan-announces-aaron-wadsworth-as-general-manager/).\n\n## Recent Developments\n### New Product Launch\nOn April 2, 2024, BitTitan announced the launch of its Active Directory (AD) migration tool within MigrationWiz. This new feature allows IT professionals to transfer identities and organizational unit structures seamlessly from one AD environment to another, enhancing the migration process for users. The tool is designed to minimize downtime and preserve data integrity, making it a cost-effective alternative to manual migration processes [(Garg, 2024-04-02)](https://get.bittitan.com/blog/bittitan-news/bittitan-launches-migrationwiz-active-directory-migration-solution/).\n\n### Leadership Changes\nOn June 5, 2024, BitTitan appointed Aaron Wadsworth as General Manager. Wadsworth, who has been with the company since 2020, previously held roles in business development and enterprise sales. His appointment is expected to drive BitTitan's mission forward, focusing on innovation and customer success [(Cary, 2024-06-05)](https://get.bittitan.com/blog/bittitan-news/bittitan-announces-aaron-wadsworth-as-general-manager/).\n\n## Product Information\n### MigrationWiz\nMigrationWiz is BitTitan's primary product, facilitating the migration of data across various platforms. The tool supports migrations for Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and other cloud environments. Key features of MigrationWiz include:\n- **Automatic Discovery and Migration**: Users can automatically discover and migrate AD objects, including users and groups.\n- **Password Synchronization**: This feature ensures a seamless user experience during the migration process.\n- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Administrators can monitor migration status and identify issues in real-time.\n- **Advanced Mapping and Filtering**: Administrators can map source and target AD objects and filter out unwanted data [(Garg, 2024-04-02)](https://get.bittitan.com/blog/bittitan-news/bittitan-launches-migrationwiz-active-directory-migration-solution/).\n\n### Pricing\nThe Active Directory migration license is priced per user, and BitTitan offers various bundles, including the User Migration Bundle (UMB), which allows for mailbox and OneDrive migrations as part of a comprehensive solution [(Garg, 2024-04-02)](https://get.bittitan.com/blog/bittitan-news/bittitan-launches-migrationwiz-active-directory-migration-solution/).\n\n## Market Position and Competitors\nBitTitan is recognized as a market leader in migration automation, but it faces competition from other providers like Cloudiway, which offers a suite of migration services that some users claim outshine BitTitan in terms of quality and support. For instance, Cloudiway reportedly guarantees faster response times and offers more advanced functionalities for specific migration needs [(Cloudiway, 2024-04-15)](https://cloudiway.com/the-best-bittitan-alternative-why-choose-cloudiway/).\n\n## Customer Feedback\nCustomer feedback on MigrationWiz has been generally positive, with users praising its ease of use and effective support. One user noted, \"The MigrationWiz product has assisted us in multiple migration projects... resulting in better profit margins for our company\" [(ISO Certificate, 2024-10-03)](https://now.bittitan.com/lp-migrationwiz-kit-ISOcertifications). However, some users have reported challenges, particularly with specific migration scenarios, indicating that while the tool is powerful, it may not be without its issues [(techcommunity.microsoft.com, 2024-07-13)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365/bittitan-t2t-migration-without-mpn-id/td-p/4140152).\n\n## Conclusion\nBitTitan continues to innovate and expand its offerings in the managed services automation space, particularly with the recent launch of its Active Directory migration tool. The company's leadership changes and commitment to customer success position it well for future growth. However, prospective candidates and investors should consider the competitive landscape and customer feedback when evaluating BitTitan's market position and product effectiveness. \n\nFor more information about BitTitan and its products, visit [BitTitan's official website](https://www.bittitan.com)."
