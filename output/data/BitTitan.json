  "summary_markdown": "# About BitTitan\n\nBitTitan, founded on January 1, 2007, is a prominent technology company specializing in cloud migration solutions. The company is best known for its flagship product, MigrationWiz, which facilitates the migration of data such as mailboxes, documents, and user settings across various platforms, including Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace. BitTitan's solutions are designed to simplify complex migration processes, making them accessible to Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and IT professionals.\n\nBitTitan operates on a B2B model, serving a global customer base that includes over 36,000 customers in 187 countries. The company has successfully migrated more than 13 million users to the cloud, supporting major cloud ecosystems like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Dropbox [(Crunchbase, 2024)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bittitan-2).\n\nThe company's revenue details are not explicitly mentioned, but it has received significant funding, totaling $45 million, with $30 million raised in June 2021 and $15 million in June 2016 [(Crunchbase, 2024)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bittitan-2). BitTitan's products are distributed as Software as a Service (SaaS), allowing for easy access and scalability.\n\nBitTitan has evolved by enhancing its partnerships and expanding its market reach, supported by investments from TVC Capital, which provides strategic insights and support for growth [(TVC Capital, 2023)](https://tvccapital.com/).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Aaron Wadsworth**: Appointed as General Manager in June 2024, Aaron Wadsworth is a seasoned tech leader with a background in managing and scaling technology companies [(Business Wire, 2024-06-03)](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240605055425/en/BitTitan-Announces-Seasoned-Tech-Leader-Aaron-Wadsworth-as-General-Manager).\n\n- **Tim O’Neill**: Appointed for APAC sales in August 2023, Tim O’Neill is responsible for expanding BitTitan's presence in the Asia-Pacific region [(Sasha Karen (ARN), 2023-08-28)](https://www.arnnet.com.au/article/708509/bittitan-taps-tim-o-neill-apac-sales/?fp=2&fpid=1).\n\n# News\n\n## Leadership and Appointments\n\n- **Aaron Wadsworth as General Manager**: In June 2024, BitTitan announced the appointment of Aaron Wadsworth as General Manager, highlighting the company's focus on strengthening its leadership team [(Business Wire, 2024-06-03)](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240605055425/en/BitTitan-Announces-Seasoned-Tech-Leader-Aaron-Wadsworth-as-General-Manager).\n\n- **Tim O’Neill for APAC Sales**: In August 2023, BitTitan appointed Tim O’Neill to lead sales efforts in the Asia-Pacific region, indicating a strategic push to expand its market reach in this area [(Sasha Karen (ARN), 2023-08-28)](https://www.arnnet.com.au/article/708509/bittitan-taps-tim-o-neill-apac-sales/?fp=2&fpid=1).\n\n## Product and Market Developments\n\n- **End of Support for Certain Migrations**: BitTitan announced that it would end support for low-instance migrations from Groupwise, Lotus Notes, and Dropbox using MigrationWiz by March 31, 2025. This move is part of the company's strategy to modernize its offerings [(Cary, 2024)](https://get.bittitan.com/blog/bittitan-news/end-of-support-for-lotus-notes-groupwise-and-dropbox/).\n\n- **Cloud Services Brokerage Market Growth**: BitTitan is part of the rapidly growing Cloud Services Brokerage market, which is expected to see significant developments in the coming years [(Future of Media, 2024-01-14)](https://www.futureofmediaevents.com/markets/cloud-services-brokerage-csb-rapidly-growing-market-globally-accenture-doublehorn-jamcracker-ibm-hpe/103007/).\n\n## Industry and Market Position\n\n- **Competitive Landscape**: BitTitan operates in a competitive market with other migration tools like ShareGate and Quest On Demand Migration. While MigrationWiz is praised for its ease of use, it may lack some comprehensive reporting features compared to competitors [(ShareGate Team, 2024)](https://sharegate.com/blog/whats-the-best-tool-for-your-google-workspace-to-microsoft-365-migration).\n\n- **Pricing Model**: BitTitan's pricing is based on a pay-per-user and/or per-GB basis, which can be more expensive for larger migrations compared to flat-rate pricing models offered by some competitors [(ShareGate Team, 2024)](https://sharegate.com/blog/whats-the-best-tool-for-your-google-workspace-to-microsoft-365-migration).\n\nIn conclusion, BitTitan, through its MigrationWiz product, remains a key player in the cloud migration industry, offering user-friendly and automated solutions for IT professionals and MSPs. The company's strategic appointments and focus on modernizing its offerings position it well for continued growth, although potential customers should carefully consider its pricing structure relative to competitors.",

If you send an email, you may get a reply  3-4 days later with weblinks that we have already read. \n\nHere is our issue. We have no problem creating the Project in BitTitan for GSuite email to Office 365 migration. It works as advertised. \n\nIf we create a New Project  for Documents (GDrive to OneDrive), we do not have an option to select Google Drive (Own Service Account), upload a JSON file and enter Super Admin credentials. We can only select Google Drive, then One Drive (Destination) and Advanced Options. Because of this, it will fail validation.\n\nThanks in advance\n\n## Comment ID i77g43s with +15 score by [(yothhedgedigger, Reddit, 2022-05-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/uhp9r0/bittitan_support_is_a_mess_need_insight_on/i77g43s/) (in reply to ID uhp9r0):\nI'm sorry I don't have an answer, but I did want to confirm that support is almost nonexistent there now.

      "# Post ID 5r7lcv: Burned by BitTitan, need new ideas for O365 Migrations with +9 score by [(tommucha, Reddit, 2017-01-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5r7lcv/burned_by_bittitan_need_new_ideas_for_o365/)\n**TL;DR - DeploymentPro is broken on the back end, what else do people use for Outlook profile migrations, either standalone or a full migration product?**\n\nWe've used SkyKick before and for more than double the price of BitTitan, I wasn't happy with what it does.  Any other 3rd party tools out there that at least can do Outlook profile migrations?  I'm going to look more into the minimal hybrid option and use MRS moves, but documentation is very limited on the new minimal hybrid so I need to lab it out with some MS Partner hours to help.  While the minimal hybrid may be my answer, it won't be a fit for all projects.  \n.\n\nThe story below:\n\nWe've used the BitTitan family of products for 20 or so Office 365 migrations so we're fairly comfortable with the software. On our last project, DeploymentPro left us standing there with having to manually configure 100 Outlook profiles.  If you don't know what DeploymentPro is, it reconfigures Outlook profiles on the desktop, saving lots of time in a migration.\n\nYesterday was cutover day.  MigrationWiz worked fine, but DeploymentPro was throwing errors on the client side and the management website.  Check the status page - Degraded Performance for DeploymentPro with no other details.\n\nWith no phone number to call to talk to a person, we start a chat.  Can't help in chat, someone will followup in 24-48hrs.  After letting that soak in, we shelled out the $250  to get someone on the phone only to find out there is a known issue with the SQL server used for DepoymentPro losing connectivity/going offline and there is no ETA on the fix.  If it's not back up, they'll refund the money for DeploymentPro, and hopefully the $250 premium support.  I'm not going to rant about the practice of leaving something that's broken in production, that's reserved for a cold beer at the pub.\n\nSo now its a mad rush to configure 100 PCs over 3 locations.

Regarding premium phone support licenses, we always refund those if the issue is on our end of things (which is the case here).\n\nOur investigation showed the following:\n\t1. You are using the legacy version of Deployment Pro (https://community.bittitan.com/partners/Pages/Partner%20Portal/Miscellaneous/DeploymentPro.aspx).\n\t2. We recommend switching to the new version for future projects (http://blog.bittitan.com/preview-snazzy-new-deploymentpro) - see benefits.\n\t3. We acknowledge and understand the root cause of the issue you experienced. It is related to a Microsoft SQL performance issue. We've contacted the vendor (Microsoft) and posted a notification as soon as we were aware of the issue (http://status.bittitan.com).\n\nIn addition to your full refund, we've also deposited 25 free Deployment Pro licenses to your account.\n\nAgain, we're sorry about the inconvenience and are confident you will have an improved experience using new version of Deployment Pro.\n\n### Comment ID dd6bst3 with +2 score by [(emeffinsteve, Reddit, 2017-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5r7lcv/burned_by_bittitan_need_new_ideas_for_o365/dd6bst3/) (in reply to ID dd5uxnt):\nI've got a potential project migrating 14 mailboxes from one Office 365 account to another.

As I've said in my post, we've used you guys for a bunch of deployments and BitTitan has been our go to.  We're not big fish in the sea of email migrations, so a response like this is a nice touch.  \n\nI'll be honest that this is the first time I've heard of a new version of DeploymentPro and that we're using a legacy version.  We would setup DP through the portal after getting the MigrationWiz project configured,  and when I just ran through it, I saw no mention of this being a legacy version.  I'll review the links you've provided and review the steps with the team to make sure this doesn't happen again.  \n\nWhen we go kick off migrations, we normally don't go checking the status pages to make sure everything is in the green,  I'll be adding that to our checklist.  Would you recommend any other steps for us to perform some kind of pre-flight check to make sure all the back end systems are chugging along happily?\n\n#### Comment ID dd6fufg with +3 score by [(bittitansupport, Reddit, 2017-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5r7lcv/burned_by_bittitan_need_new_ideas_for_o365/dd6fufg/) (in reply to ID dd642rk):\nHi Tom, really appreciate your response.

I don't remember the error/ issue but DP completely failed even though it worked for my previous tests. (I will find the support ticket today and share it). I contacted them right away via chat. They said 1-2 day response. No good. I bought a premium support ticket and someone called me in about 1.5 hours. They looked at it and said \"I see there is an issue with our server.\" They didnt have an ETA though. So I contacted the client and pushed migration by a week. Ugh. HOPING DP would be working.

It was for the new version using DMA, not the legacy one. I was migrating 300 users from Exchange hosted to Office 365. Testing on a couple of machines went perfectly.\n\nFirst, the DMA agent used up all of the available drive space on every workstation. The agent had a bug that kept generating new log files. That was a major problem that we had to deal with. I called BitTitan support and they told us to delete the log files and told me they were knew about the bug and were working on an update that would get automatically pushed down to the workstations when it was available.\n\nSecond, the new updated DMA agent that BitTitan released that night to fix the bug, was never reporting back to the BitTitan DMA servers. We had no idea because you have to look in a different area of the portal to see this info. The DeploymentPro console showed the agent successfully installed but under they only show the last heartbeat received under the DMA console. Very confusing and unintuitive interface.\n\nThird, we had a made a change to the naming convention for our Office 365 users after this MigrationWiz/BitTitan project was created. Support showed me how to change the destination address in the DeploymentPro console for each user, manually. But when you made the change it was never reflected in the console. It continues to show the previous name. Support told me that is a bug in the interface but he was sure thru his testing that the backend was successfully updated. And because it did not reflect the proper destination name after making the change, I had to schedule the agent to run instead of kicking it off when I was ready. Not ideal in this situation.\n\nNo fast forward a couple of days to the day of the cutover and all of these bugs made for the perfect storm for my customer. The schedule never started on half of the machines and on the other half the agent would hang and never continue. We had about an 80% failure rate.\n\nIt turns out that the new updated agent never checked in to the BitTitan servers so it never received the updated destination name or the schedule that I set. Support said we would have to wait 24 hours for a call back. I checked with support again an hour later when we were getting no where with our efforts to get Outlook working again. I was told this time that we could pay $250 for priority phone support. By the time we got support we needed and got to the root of the problem it was too little, too late. The whole day was shot. We got everyone back online after visiting most workstations but many of them did not get their nickname cache or their rules migrated over.\n\nI believe the customer was able to get a refund from BitTitan for DeploymentPro but the product really killed us and I would not feel comfortable using it again in the future.\n\n### Comment ID dd9f8fa with +2 score by [(tommucha, Reddit, 2017-02-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5r7lcv/burned_by_bittitan_need_new_ideas_for_o365/dd9f8fa/) (in reply to ID dd8tksx):\nWow that doesn't sound like a good time, thanks for sharing your story.

Hopefully next time I use it they have worked the bugs out and I will also know better what to keep an eye on.\n\nThat was about a month ago and I haven't had a need for a 3rd party migration tool like that since. Friends of mine have used Skykick and love it but it is more expensive. Skykick does everything for you. It is especially good for an Office 365 tenant to tenant migration because it will deprovision the domain from the old tenant and add it to the new tenant for you.

It is a Workspace->Workspace migration.\n\nI had to fight tooth-and-nail to force them to investigate far enough to recognize the issue is on their end. They admitted it was their problem and their dev team was engaged in working on a fix, but that has gone on for 60 days now. Despite insisting several times, they refuse to provide any timeline.\n\nHere are the main points underlining their unacceptable response to this issue:\n\n1. They flippantly suggest switching to imap, but \"note that this will duplicate content\". They're joking, right? They know that clients won't be happy with this and a massive amount of effort will go into cleaning out the old content to start fresh.\n2. They're dragging their feet and taking no responsibility. Any org worth their salt would have proactively offered a refund before we reached 60 days of no resolution.\n3. They refuse a refund. The \"Technical Support Manager for US Region\" (and now the \"head of support for the whole org\") themselves stated \"refunding the license is not possible because I could see that you have already migrated some data\". Can't make this stuff up, folks.\n4. Licenses are still on sale, with no warning posted on product page; no warning at checkout; no warning during project setup; no warning on blog, website, support site, or status dashboard. They do not care that their product is broken, and that many others will spin up projects only to get half way through before discovering this disaster; I'm sure they will be refused refunds, as well.\n\nIt has been a long time coming with MigrationWiz, but I think this is the last straw. I cannot in good faith ever recommend this product again. It has consistently gone down-hill year after year.\n\nAMA, leave your condolences, or let me know what alternatives you're liking better. I'm going to be trying AvePoint Fly shortly. It's going to be an annoying few weeks while I clean this mess up.\n\nUPDATE: supposedly my ticket made it to the head of support across the whole org. Still refusing refund. Apologized for the frustration but still offered no timeline or commitment to resolution. Offered me 2x the licenses in lieu of the refund... totally tone deaf. What am I going to do with free licenses for a product I can't trust?\n\n  \nUPDATE 2: they replied to my ticket to let me know that a status message is now posted on their status dashboard here [https://status.bittitan.com/](https://status.bittitan.com/) . Unfortunately, they knew about this issue for at least 60 days but have only begun showing this message now.

I did a prestage migration for everything up to 30 days, and on the day of final migration. I ran the final migration multiple times to be safe. However, recently I had one user complain that his entire 2020 year of his calendar was missing. I reported this to MigrationWiz, who recommended I reset statistics and run a full migration again. This time, it found more than 6000 items that were missed the first time. So, I reset statistics again, and ran it again, and it found hundreds of items missed. I had zero errors. I would not recommend anyone use this product ever again.\n\nI spent about 2 weeks recently writing a program using AI that helps me migrate mail using Graph API and I have successfully tested it on some test mailboxes. I am not experienced enough to use it for any production environments, but I would love it if someone with actual programming skills can make some competition here. I definitely cannot use an app that is moving hundreds of thousands of emails, and will miss things.\n\nAlso, their documentation is bad. I saw someone saying they have good documentation, but it is definitely not good. I have been in IT for 20 years and was an Exchange tier 7 for many years. I liked the convenience of something like MigrationWiz, but when the mailboxes appear to be the same on both sides, only missing a handful of items in each mailbox, what exactly am I supposed to do when the scan says all the files are the same? I trusted the system too much and became complacent! I should have checked the actual number of items, but some of my these users have hundreds of folders, which is wild to say the least.\n\n## Comment ID lewuwca with +1 score by [(djweis, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ebzo7d/bittitanmigrationwiz_is_broken_no_public_comment/lewuwca/) (in reply to ID 1ebzo7d):\nI figured out the built in 365 migration tool and moved a customer over in the time it took for BitTitan support to reply to a similar issue I was having.\n\n## Comment ID lewxceo with +1 score by [(PEBKAC-Live, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ebzo7d/bittitanmigrationwiz_is_broken_no_public_comment/lewxceo/) (in reply to ID 1ebzo7d):\nWell this is very interesting, I have just sent an email to them today requesting a refund for a failed GSuite to SharePoint migration.\n\n\nOur engineer has been battling with as their support as it has taken 2 weeks for 300Gb of data to migrate.\n\n\nYet we have cancelled and manually migrated the data and did 300gb in a day.\n\n\nI got involved today as our client was hugely unhappy with how long it is taking, so have now asked for a full refund.\n\n### Comment ID lewzty4 with +1 score by [(L0ngpants, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ebzo7d/bittitanmigrationwiz_is_broken_no_public_comment/lewzty4/) (in reply to ID lewxceo):\nGood luck, I'd love to hear what the result is...\n\nMy issue was Gmail-specific but based on how they handled this, I would not be surprised if their whole system is held together with duct tape and bubblegum.\n\n#### Comment ID lfgiaxs with +1 score by [(PEBKAC-Live, Reddit, 2024-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1ebzo7d/bittitanmigrationwiz_is_broken_no_public_comment/lfgiaxs/) (in reply to ID lewzty4):\nWe got an email Friday night asking for a Teams meeting on Monday.

This may be a result of a large number of files, total size of files, depth of folder structure, etc. \n\nWhen you exceed this limit, the copy stops, and the Web UI shows that the job is complete and 100% successful. Subsequent updates fail silently, with no error in the Web UI.\n\nThe only way to discover that you have exceeded this limit is if you have exported the unpublished detail log to an SQL target. Or to check the stats between the old and new sites.\n\nThis means that you may have thousands of files that fail copy or fail to update after your final sync.\n\n**NONE OF THIS IS DOCUMENTED**\n\nTHERE IS NO WARNING\n\nIf you do use BitTitan, be sure to check your site item counts and document size totals to make sure you have copied everything\n\n## Comment ID i3hh2qs with +3 score by [(ekix, Reddit, 2022-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/twqa1c/it_bittitans_support_always_incompetent_or_am_i/i3hh2qs/) (in reply to ID twqa1c):\nI can recommend the built-in Sharepoint Migration Tool it works great for G-suite.\n\nHowever I always prefer to use BitTitan or Skykick when migrating mail.\n\n### Comment ID i3hr4ac with +1 score by [(RipRapRob, Reddit, 2022-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/twqa1c/it_bittitans_support_always_incompetent_or_am_i/i3hr4ac/) (in reply to ID i3hh2qs):\nWe use this all the time, when migrating from a server, but I don't think it supports migrating directly from Google Drive?\n\n#### Comment ID i3j1vhq with +1 score by [(Nordon, Reddit, 2022-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/twqa1c/it_bittitans_support_always_incompetent_or_am_i/i3j1vhq/) (in reply to ID i3hr4ac):\nIt does!

They list GDrive, Box, Dropbox, Egnyte, Amazon S3, and Google Cloud Storage, amongst others, as sources for transfer. The destination, however, is only a Microsoft-owned one (after all, Microsoft bought this product for a reason).\n\nI honestly cannot recall if the cost is included in your SharePoint subscription, but it is a useful tool.\n\nBitTitan support does suck eggs, though. I did a move over a weekend, and opened a case with high priority on the Friday night at the start of the migration. Crickets.\n\nEnded up resolving / working around the issue on our own. It wasn't until the Tuesday *after* the move when we heard the *first* response from them over email. Maybe there's a paid support option that gets you help faster but this is bordering on ridiculous.\n\nMost of my mail migrations are Exchange Online to Exchange Online, so I'm planning on playing around with the built in migration tools there.

Used MigrationWiz for many years. Haven't done one in a bit since all the changes on the O365 side. I went through their extensive documentation and ran into an error complaining that the secret key for app XXX is expired. However, nowhere do I have an app XXX (mine is YYY, for example). And nowhere in their documentation does it say to even create a secret key. I have set up a few things with other products with the API permissions, so I was suprised when it didn't say to create a key. I have made one, but no luck.  \n\n\nI haven't gotten the licenses yet, so I might actually try the MS direct one.

      "# [How to Migrate from Intermedia to Microsoft 365 using BitTitan by Isabel Claassen on 2024-10-25](https://moremax.net/intermedia-microsoft-migration/)\nMigrating email and data from Intermedia to Microsoft 365 might feel overwhelming, especially when dealing with multiple mailboxes, user permissions, and data integrity. Fortunately, BitTitan’s MigrationWiz tool simplifies this complex process by automating key steps and providing a straightforward approach to data transfer.\n\nWith the right preparation and tools, you can ensure minimal disruption to your team and maintain full control over the migration.\n\nBelow, we’ve outlined a detailed, step-by-step guide to help you transition smoothly, so you can start leveraging the full power of Microsoft 365 without the hassle.\n\nStep 1: Set Up a Migration User on Intermedia\n\nStart by creating a dedicated user account on Intermedia that has access to all the mailboxes you plan to migrate. This migration user needs the correct permissions to access each mailbox, ensuring a seamless data transfer.\n\nStep 2: Create an Account on BitTitan\n\nNext, sign up or log in to BitTitan at [MigrationWiz]\n\nMigrationWiz is BitTitan’s powerful, cloud-based migration tool that supports a wide range of data transfer needs, from mailboxes to documents and personal archives.\n\nStep 3: Set Up Your Project in BitTitan\n\nWithin the MigrationWiz dashboard, create a new migration project:\n\n1. Configure Source and Destination Settings\n\n– Source: Select ‘Exchange Server 2003+’ as your source type. You’ll need your Outlook Web Access (OWA) URL to ensure MigrationWiz can access the data on Intermedia.\n\n– Destination: Choose ‘Microsoft 365’ for the destination. Here, you’ll set up a dedicated migration account with administrative access in Microsoft 365.\n\n2. Gather Required Information\n\n– For the Microsoft 365 connection, you’ll need your **Application ID** and **Tenant ID**. These credentials link MigrationWiz to your Microsoft 365 environment, giving it the permissions needed for data migration.\n\nStep 4: Save and Review Your Project\n\nOnce the project is configured, save it and review the mailboxes that have been populated within MigrationWiz. Take a moment to ensure all intended mailboxes are listed to avoid any gaps in data transfer.\n\nStep 5: Prepare Microsoft 365 Accounts\n\nIn Microsoft 365, create users that match the Intermedia mailboxes and assign appropriate licenses. This setup prepares the destination environment to receive data from Intermedia. Without assigned licenses, users won’t have active mailboxes.\n\nStep 6: Verify Credentials\n\nWith users in place, run a “Verify Credentials” check within MigrationWiz to ensure all connections and permissions are working correctly. Once completed, you’ll know if any access or connection adjustments are needed.\n\nStep 7: Conduct a Trial Migration\n\nTo minimize risk, start with a trial migration. MigrationWiz allows you to migrate a small amount of data first, so you can identify and resolve any potential issues. This trial is essential for fine-tuning before the full migration.\n\nStep 8: Purchase BitTitan Licenses\n\nOnce you’re satisfied with the setup, purchase the appropriate BitTitan licenses. The number and type of licenses depend on your specific needs, and MoreMax can assist with selecting the right option to ensure cost-effectiveness.\n\nStep 9: Migration Roadmap\n\nAfter a successful connection test, follow this roadmap for the full migration:\n\n1. Pre-stage Migration for All Accounts\n\nA pre-stage migration will move most data initially, making the final cutover faster and easier for users. This phase is particularly useful for large mailboxes, as it reduces downtime when users switch to Microsoft 365.\n\n2. Change MX Records\n\nUpdate your MX records to direct new email traffic to Microsoft 365. This change is essential for a seamless cutover and ensures that incoming mail reaches the correct destination once users start using Microsoft 365 exclusively.\n\n3. Run the Full Migration\n\nComplete the migration by running the full transfer. Monitor for any errors and resolve them before rerunning migrations if necessary. This final step ensures all data has been transferred accurately, with no missing messages or disruptions.\n\nFollowing this step-by-step guide will help ensure a successful migration from Intermedia to Microsoft 365 using BitTitan’s MigrationWiz. Taking the time to set up correctly, test, and review each phase reduces risks and ensures a smooth experience for all users.\n\nYou are welcome to reach out if you need any help or have any questions.",
      "# [What’s the best tool for your Google Workspace to Microsoft 365 migration? by ShareGate Team on 2024-11-12](https://sharegate.com/blog/whats-the-best-tool-for-your-google-workspace-to-microsoft-365-migration)\nMicrosoft has launched a unified first-party toolset for migrating Google Workspace workloads to Microsoft 365—but is it the best fit for your company’s Google Workspace migration? To answer that question, we explore some of the top cloud migration tools on the market today.\n\nWhile no migration tool can replace a solid strategy and skilled team, the right tech stack can certainly simplify your job as an IT admin, making the process smoother, faster, and more efficient. But with hundreds of cloud migration tools to choose from—ranging from budget-friendly to premium enterprise solutions—it can be overwhelming to sift through them all.\n\nOur engineers did a ton of research into platform-to-platform cloud migration while developing ShareGate’s Google Workspace to Microsoft 365 migration functionality. A big part of that process included looking at Microsoft’s Migration Manager and leading third-party tools to understand their capabilities and limitations.\n\nTo help you assess which migration tool is the right fit for your organization, we decided to share what we learned and walk you through some of the top cloud migration tools currently on the market, helping you identify which is best suited for a seamless transition in your organization.\n\nToday’s cloud migration tools offer a wide range of features, from advanced data handling to real-time monitoring and post-migration support. Each tool brings unique strengths to the table, tailored to meet specific business needs and goals.\n\nUltimately, there’s a data migration tool for every business’s unique needs and goals—and we’re to help you pick the best-fit tool specifically for you.\n\nWe’re going to dive into the nitty gritty details of the Google Workspace migration tools from ShareGate, Microsoft, BitTitan, and AvePoint, but first, let’s do a quick overview!\n\nShareGate Migrate Pro/Essentials\n\nShareGate Migrate’s end-to-end software solution offers several advantages that make it a strong contender for the best Google Workspace to Microsoft 365 migration solution. Designed with IT admins in mind, its Google Workspace migration tool is intuitive and user-friendly. The simple user interface streamlines complicated migration tasks, so your team can migrate faster and meet tight deadlines. Plus, ShareGate’s out-of-the-box features go beyond Microsoft’s built-in tools, offering hassle-free deployments, concurrent migrations, and centralized reporting.\n\nThe ShareGate platform isn’t just about smooth migrations—it also provides security and governance guidance and strong post-migration support. ShareGate’s Migrate Pro and Enterprise plans give you access to our turnkey Microsoft 365 end-user training solution and ShareGate Protect, our SaaS solution for ongoing security and compliance. But no matter which plan you choose, you’ll always get unlimited data, workloads, and end users for one flat price.\n\nWhile ShareGate Migrate is a powerful cloud migration tool, it does come with a few limitations. For instance, it’s not free—though it offers a straightforward flat-rate pricing model, which can simplify budgeting for IT teams. Additionally, ShareGate does not currently support Gmail migrations. However, this gap can be easily managed with the help of Microsoft’s free migration tools for Gmail transfers to Exchange Online, making ShareGate an excellent option for the bulk of your data migration needs.\n\nPros:\n\nUser-friendly interface suitable for all experience levels\n\nPowerful, trusted migration engine that leaves nothing behind and has the ability to run concurrent migrations while mitigating throttling to help you meet deadlines\n\nPost-migration optimization in Microsoft 365 with granular reporting, permissions management, security, and ongoing governance\n\nUnlimited end users, data, workflows, and support at a fixed price\n\nTurnkey Microsoft 365 end-user training resources to boost adoption\n\nCons:\n\nNot free, though priced at a flat rate\n\nDoes not support mailbox migrations (can be supplemented with Microsoft’s free tool)\n\nMicrosoft’s built-in migration solutions\n\nThe primary appeal of Microsoft’s in-house solution is that it’s free, making it a cost-effective choice for those with tight budgets. Additionally, Microsoft’s first-party tools are capable of migrating mailboxes, a key feature for many businesses looking to transfer email histories seamlessly from Gmail to Exchange Online.\n\nWith the retirement of Mover.io, Microsoft has also introduced a new comprehensive data migration toolset designed to assist with the transition from Google Workspace to Microsoft 365. The unified toolset, accessible via the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, assists with migrating mailbox data (emails, contacts, and calendars) to Microsoft Exchange and moving content (files, metadata, and permissions) to OneDrive or SharePoint Online, making the process more straightforward for tenant administrators.\n\nScreenshot of the Microsoft Migration Manager experience\n\nOne of the standout features is the Simplified Gmail Migration (SGM), tailored for small to medium-sized businesses with up to 1,000 users. This feature enables direct and seamless mailbox migrations, bypassing the need for complex batching processes, email-only IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocols) migrations, or PowerShell.\n\nDespite these improvements, some limitations remain. The built-in tools may still require manual configurations and a higher degree of technical expertise, which can extend the preparation and execution timelines. Additionally, they don’t offer the advanced reporting and monitoring functionalities available in third-party solutions — capabilities that can be vital for tracking progress and promptly resolving issues during and after the migration process.\n\nBitTitan MigrationWiz\n\nBitTitan MigrationWiz is a popular choice for migrating data between platforms, particularly for its ability to migrate mailboxes. This feature can be an advantage for organizations if they need to transfer extensive email histories and user settings. For IT teams looking for a tool specifically to handle Gmail migrations, BitTitan offers a reliable solution.\n\nHowever, BitTitan’s scope of capabilities doesn’t match the comprehensiveness found in tools like ShareGate. While it can manage straightforward data migrations, BitTitan lacks the in-depth reporting, monitoring, and customization options that make ShareGate so versatile. This can be a drawback for organizations with complex needs or those that require greater control over specific migration elements.\n\nIn addition, BitTitan’s pricing structure—charging per user and/or per GB—can lead to higher costs, especially for large-scale migrations. This pay-per-use model may result in unpredictable costs that exceed ShareGate’s flat-rate pricing, making it a less budget-friendly choice for IT teams managing tight budgets or larger migrations.\n\nPros:\n\nSupports Gmail migrations\n\nFlexible data migration\n\nScalable\n\nCons:\n\nNot a comprehensive end-to-end solution compared to a tool like ShareGate, which has end-user training as well as security and governance features\n\nCharges per user or per GB, often resulting in higher costs, particularly when using custom configuration for flexibility and scaling\n\nAvePoint Fly\n\nAvePoint Fly is another well-regarded tool in the Microsoft 365/Office 365 cloud migration space, known for its ability to handle large-scale, complex migrations, including detailed pre-migration analysis and high-speed data transfers. With AvePoint, IT teams can effectively manage complex data structures and maintain consistency throughout the transition process, ensuring minimal disruption and a smooth shift to the new platform. This makes it a strong option for organizations that need to seamlessly move a wide range of data from Google Workspace to Microsoft 365.\n\nHowever, AvePoint does have its limitations, especially when compared to more comprehensive tools like ShareGate. While AvePoint handles standard migrations well, it lacks some of the in-depth reporting, monitoring, and customization features that many IT admins find essential for complex migration projects unless you purchase a new license for each workload. This can be a drawback for organizations with specific data migration needs or those that require a higher level of control and flexibility throughout the process.\n\nAdditionally, AvePoint’s licensing model can make it a more expensive choice over time. Unlike ShareGate’s flat-rate pricing, AvePoint requires the purchase of multiple licenses for various functions, leading to potentially higher and less predictable costs. For larger organizations or those with extensive data to migrate, this multi-license structure can quickly become a budgetary concern.\n\nPros:\n\nSupports Gmail migrations with an additional license purchase\n\nFast and flexible migrations, depending on the number of licenses purchased\n\nHas security and governance features, each with an additional license purchase\n\nExtensive onboarding resources\n\nCons:\n\nDoesn’t migrate permissions, versions, or metadata\n\nRequires multiple licenses, often resulting in higher costs\n\nReady to accelerate your Google Cloud to Microsoft Cloud transition?\n\nWhether your organization is growing fast, merging, or rethinking Google Workspace’s costs—migrating to Microsoft 365 can feel like a big undertaking, especially with tight deadlines and keeping data safe and intact. IT teams are under pressure to make it happen smoothly, but a Google-to-Microsoft migration often means diving into unfamiliar territory. How do you make the move without losing data or hitting compatibility snags?\n\nIf you’re ready to drive your Google migration project to a successful finish, sign up for our upcoming webinar, How to migrate Google Workspace to Microsoft 365: Best Practices, with Microsoft MVP Denis Molodtsov. In this live session, he’ll walk you through the essentials of planning a seamless migration—from licensing to provisioning and storage—and share tips for converting files, identity mapping, and managing permissions and orphaned Google Drives. Plus, he’ll show you how automation with ShareGate’s PowerShell module can save you hours of manual work",
      "# [Software-Focused Growth Equity](https://tvccapital.com/)\n“When we went looking for an investment partner, I wasn’t interested in having another boss. We were seeking a partner who would leverage their expertise to improve our company’s bottom line. For BitTitan, TVC is more than an investor. They understand that running and growing a company is hard and their advice enables our success as we navigate uncharted territories. The team at TVC is always accessible for anything we need. We consider TVC a trusted business partner.”\n\n“Throughout the lifecycle of the investment, TVC was a great partner for me as CEO and for the business itself. Their operating experience provided great insights and enabled us to better plan, measure, and grow the business to achieve a significant increase in valuation.”\n\n“Partnering with TVC Capital was game-changing for Limeade. They provide real operating insights in ways most venture investors can’t. Every day, they put their reputation, connections and experience to work for us — whether we ask or not. They are investors, but also friends and mentors.”\n\n“I’ve had the good fortune of working with TVC Capital twice as a CEO. During my first experience working with TVC Capital, they represented our first and only institutional capital and, over the course of five years, they proved essential in helping us execute on our business plan and ultimately exit the company successfully with a sale to Polycom in 2011. When I joined MediaPlatform as CEO in 2015, TVC Capital was the first prospective investor I approached and, thankfully, we’re working together again. Over the 10+ years I’ve worked with them, their capabilities continue to get more and more impressive, but they still maintain a critical level of accessibility and involvement of a trusted partner.”\n\n“TVC Capital is not just an investor, they are a trusted partner. TVC consistently provides useful guidance and is always available to provide direct feedback on an approach. They deliver a sense of ‘patient urgency’ in our interactions bringing a healthy blend of experience from real challenges and encouraging push for accomplishments. ReverseVision is my second firm with TVC as an investor. Given all the options available, this second round indicates how highly valued the relationship has become. I would not hesitate to participate with them again in the future.”",
      "# [Cross Tenant Microsoft 365 Migration by Uzair Amir, www.facebook.com, AsevenX.foREVer on 2024-03-21](https://hackread.com/cross-tenant-microsoft-365-migration/)\nWhat is a Cross Tenant migration, and why and when do you need it? Cross-tenant migration refers to the process of moving data, applications, and services from one Microsoft 365 tenant (or organization) to another. Whether due to mergers, acquisitions, restructuring, or strategic decisions, businesses often find themselves in situations where they need to consolidate or reorganize their tenant structures.\n\nThe different actors\n\nWhen it comes to tenant-to-tenant migration within Microsoft 365, several key actors play crucial roles in ensuring a successful transition. Let’s explore them:\n\nMicrosoft Consulting Services (MCS): Organizations often collaborate with MCS to plan and execute tenant migrations. Their expertise ensures a smooth transition, addressing complexities and minimizing disruptions1.\n\nMicrosoft Partners: These skilled professionals specialize in tenant migrations. They work closely with organizations, offering tailored solutions and leveraging third-party tools for content migration1.\n\nIT Administrators: Within the organization, IT administrators take charge of technical aspects. They oversee user accounts, data integrity, and configuration adjustments during the migration process.\n\nIdentity Architects: These architects design the identity framework for the new tenant. They handle user authentication, access permissions, and identity synchronization across tenants.\n\nData Migration Specialists: These experts focus on moving data—emails, files, SharePoint sites—from the source to the target tenant. They ensure data fidelity and minimal downtime.\n\nChange Management Teams: Communication is key. Change management teams inform stakeholders about the migration, manage expectations, and guide users through the transition.\n\nThe different solutions: When it comes to cross-tenant Microsoft 365 migrations, several vendors and solutions can assist you in smoothly transitioning your users’ data. Here are some options:\n\nMicrosoft 365 Native Tools: Microsoft provides native tools and interfaces for cross-tenant mailbox and OneDrive migrations.\n\nThird-Party Migration Solutions: Several third-party vendors offer specialized migration tools for Microsoft 365 cross-tenant scenarios. These solutions provide additional features, flexibility, and support.\n\nSome popular vendors include:\n\nCloudiway:\n\nCloudiway specializes in cloud migration services, including Microsoft 365. Their platform is one of the most complete solutions and supports Microsoft cross-tenant migrations for mailboxes, OneDrive, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, Intune and devices. Cloudiway emphasizes ease of use and efficient migration processes.\n\nAvePoint:\n\nAvePoint offers migration solutions for Microsoft 365, including cross-tenant scenarios. Their tools provide features like Mailbox, OneDrive, Microsoft Teams and SharePoint migrations. AvePoint’s solutions are known for their reliability and comprehensive support.\n\nBitTitan:\n\nBitTitan is known for its MigrationWiz tool, which supports cross-tenant migrations for mailboxes, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams.\n\nQuest:\n\nOffers solutions like Quest On Demand Migration and Quest On Demand Migration for Email.\n\nSkyKick:\n\nSkyKick provides automated migration tools for Microsoft 365, including cross-tenant scenarios.\n\nShareGate:\n\nKnown for its ShareGate Desktop and ShareGate Migrate tools, which support SharePoint, Teams and OneDrive migrations.

Whether due to mergers, acquisitions, or strategic realignments, the need to seamlessly transition data between Microsoft 365 tenants is more prevalent than ever.\n\nVendor Selection Matters: Choosing the right migration solution is paramount. Evaluate vendors based on factors such as scope of migration, reliability, scalability, support, and ease of use. Consider both native Microsoft tools and third-party offerings.\n\nPreparation Is Key: Properly prepare your source and target tenants. Establish trust relationships, configure identity mapping, and ensure that users are set up correctly in the destination tenant.\n\nData Integrity and Security: During migration, prioritize data integrity and security. Test thoroughly, monitor progress, and address any issues promptly.\n\nCommunication and Change Management: Keep stakeholders informed throughout the process. Effective communication minimizes disruption and ensures a smooth transition for end-users.\n\nPost-Migration Validation: Validate data integrity, permissions, and functionality post-migration. Address any discrepancies promptly.\n\nRemember, cross-tenant migrations are not just about moving data; they impact user productivity, collaboration, and overall business continuity. By following best practices and leveraging the right tools, organizations can navigate this complex journey successfully.",

      "# [BitTitan MigrationWiz vs Quest On Demand Migration Comparison 2024](https://www.peerspot.com/products/comparisons/bittitan-migrationwiz_vs_quest-on-demand-migration)\nQuest On Demand Migration is a complete Office 365 migration solution that allows users to migrate all of their workloads and Active Directory quickly and securely. On Demand Migration provides the ability to migrate all Office 365 running solutions, like OneDrive, Exchange, Teams SharePoint, and on-premises Active Directory. As a result, users can now streamline Active Directory domain consolidation and migration in the cloud. In addition, direct synchronization supports the ability to maintain migrated and un-migrated users, applications, and devices in sync during a migration.\n\nQuest On Demand Migration offers the ability to track progress in real time and an intuitive dashboard allowing for complete visibility into a migration project. On Demand Migration is an excellent solution for companies in the beginning or midst of a merger and acquisition, as well as organizations looking to consolidate multiple tenants within their organization. The solution simplifies daily tenant-to-tenant migrations while allowing users to communicate and collaborate harmoniously. Additionally, with On Demand Migration, users can now move between various email platforms with a secure SaaS solution.\n\nBenefits of Quest On Demand Migration\n\nQuest On Demand Migration is a powerful migration solution that aims to assist organizations with various workloads. Since few organizations perform daily tenant migrations, Microsoft doesn’t have native tools to assist with these tasks.\n\nIn addition to the security and ease of use the solution provides, On Demand Migration offers many benefits. Some of these include:\n\nMigrate Teams automatically while ensuring continued accessibility and compliance without losing access to valuable data.\n\nProvides a near-zero impact with a complete approach to tenant-to-tenant migration with ease.\n\nDiscover and assess associated data before a migration through the intuitive dashboard.\n\nMigrate Teams and preserve valuable data and channel conversations across the organization without losing content or access.\n\nMerge and rename Teams as the migration takes place to the new tenant.\n\nOn Demand Migration offers several tier solutions to fit an organization's needs and budgets.\n\nReviews from Real Users\n\nQuest On Demand Migration is a favored solution among users for a variety of reasons, such as its stability in mailbox migration. On Demand Migration for Email allows users to seamlessly migrate their mailbox data for a variety of email platforms through a flexible solution. While most users choose the solution for a Gmail migration tool, users can migrate data from Sun Once/iPlanet, Zimbra, POP/IMAP, Exchange, to Office 365, or on-premises or hosted Exchange without installing migration software.",
      "# [Tenant Migration Solutions by Emmanuel Dreux on 2024-05-23](https://www.migrationasaservice.com/top-cloud-migration-tools/top-5-microsoft-cross-tenant-migration-solutions-in-2024/)\nDuring mergers or divestitures, you commonly need the ability to move users and data into a new Microsoft 365 tenant.\n\nThe goal of cross-tenant migration is to consolidate separate tenants into a single one for better and safer IT management. When two organizations merge, they can’t maintain their productivity levels with separate Microsoft 365 tenants. All their data and user accounts must be under a single roof.\n\nIn this article, we’ll learn what Microsoft 365 tenant-to-tenant migration looks like and – most importantly – how to choose the best tenant migration solutions in 2024.\n\nBefore we explore the best migration solutions for companies in 2024, it’s essential to consider what this migration process looks like. Imagine your company merged with another one. You wouldneed to :\n\nRecreate user accounts.\n\nMove content, such as Mailboxes, SharePoint sites, OneDrive files, Planner plans, etc.\n\nMigrateTeams channels from the source tenant to the destination one.\n\nMigrate Intune and security settings.\n\nJoin Laptops to the new tenant.\n\nOrganizations undergoing an M&A must use reliable migration tools able to cover all or part of these needs."

    "# BitTitan Company and Product Analysis\n\n## Company Overview\n\nBitTitan is a technology company specializing in cloud migration solutions, particularly known for its flagship product, MigrationWiz. Founded in 2007, BitTitan has established itself as a leader in the IT services automation space, providing tools that enable Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and IT professionals to efficiently migrate data between various platforms. The company has garnered a reputation for simplifying complex migration processes, making it a go-to solution for organizations transitioning to cloud services.\n\nIn recent developments, BitTitan has been focusing on enhancing its partnerships and expanding its market reach. The company has received investment from TVC Capital, which has been described as a \"trusted partner\" that provides valuable insights and support for BitTitan's growth strategy [(TVC Capital, 2023)](https://tvccapital.com/).\n\n## Product Overview: MigrationWiz\n\nMigrationWiz is BitTitan's primary product, designed to facilitate the migration of data, including emails, documents, and user settings, across various platforms. It supports a wide range of migration scenarios, including from Google Workspace to Microsoft 365, and is particularly noted for its user-friendly interface and automation capabilities [(Claassen, MoreMax, 2024)](https://moremax.net/intermedia-microsoft-migration/).\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Cross-Platform Support**: MigrationWiz allows for seamless data transfers between different platforms, including Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and various on-premises systems [(Amir, Hackread, 2024)](https://hackread.com/cross-tenant-microsoft-365-migration/).\n  \n- **Automation**: The tool automates many of the complex steps involved in data migration, reducing the potential for human error and minimizing downtime for users [(Claassen, MoreMax, 2024)](https://moremax.net/intermedia-microsoft-migration/).\n\n- **User-Friendly Interface**: MigrationWiz is designed with IT administrators in mind, providing a straightforward setup process that simplifies the migration experience [(ShareGate Team, 2024)](https://sharegate.com/blog/whats-the-best-tool-for-your-google-workspace-to-microsoft-365-migration).\n\n### Recent Updates\n\nBitTitan has announced that it will end support for low-instance migrations from Groupwise, Lotus Notes, and Dropbox using MigrationWiz by March 31, 2025. This decision emphasizes the company's focus on modernizing its offerings and encouraging organizations to migrate from outdated systems to more secure and efficient platforms [(Cary, 2024)](https://get.bittitan.com/blog/bittitan-news/end-of-support-for-lotus-notes-groupwise-and-dropbox/).\n\n## Market Position and Competitors\n\nBitTitan operates in a competitive landscape with several other migration tools available, such as ShareGate and Quest On Demand Migration. While MigrationWiz is recognized for its flexibility and ease of use, it has been noted that it may not offer the same level of comprehensive reporting and monitoring features as some of its competitors [(ShareGate Team, 2024)](https://sharegate.com/blog/whats-the-best-tool-for-your-google-workspace-to-microsoft-365-migration). \n\n### Pricing Structure\n\nBitTitan's pricing model is based on a pay-per-user and/or per-GB basis, which can lead to higher costs for larger migrations compared to competitors that offer flat-rate pricing models [(ShareGate Team, 2024)](https://sharegate.com/blog/whats-the-best-tool-for-your-google-workspace-to-microsoft-365-migration).\n\n## Company Scale and Employee Insights\n\nWhile specific employee numbers for BitTitan are not disclosed in the articles reviewed, the company is recognized as a significant player in the IT services automation sector, with a growing customer base that includes numerous MSPs and enterprise clients. The investment from TVC Capital indicates a positive outlook on the company's growth trajectory and operational capabilities [(TVC Capital, 2023)](https://tvccapital.com/).\n\n## Executive Insights\n\nBitTitan's leadership has expressed a commitment to leveraging partnerships and operational insights to enhance the company's offerings. The CEO has highlighted the importance of having a supportive investment partner that understands the challenges of running a technology company and can provide actionable advice [(TVC Capital, 2023)](https://tvccapital.com/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBitTitan, through its MigrationWiz product, continues to be a vital resource for organizations looking to migrate to cloud platforms efficiently. With a focus on automation, user-friendliness, and cross-platform support, BitTitan is well-positioned to meet the evolving needs of IT professionals and MSPs. However, potential customers should consider the pricing structure and compare it with competitors to ensure they choose the best solution for their migration needs. \n\nFor prospective candidates and investors, BitTitan represents a promising opportunity in the growing field of cloud migration and IT services automation, backed by strategic partnerships and a commitment to innovation."
