Our Helping Hands Month of Giving Initiative allows team members to select charities of their choice to provide donations or other forms of assistance.\n\nWhen a major bank boldly decided to retrofit over 4,300 branch units across the United States with LED lighting, it chose Current.\n\nWorking closely and collaboratively with the customer to understand its needs, Current completed the retrofit project and helped the customer realize a significant reduction in kilowatt hours of energy consumption.\n\nThe firm’s pre-retrofit kilowatt hour usage was approximately 213,504,903. After installing Current’s LED lighting and LED luminaires, the customer’s kilowatt hour usage dropped to approximately 92,227,564.\n\nThis represents energy consumption savings of approximately 121,066,831 kilowatt hours—effectively reducing the customer’s energy consumption by more than one half.\n\nWhat does this mean for sustainability?\n\nLowering energy consumption through LED technology contributes to overall lower CO2 emissions, which is critical to reducing the production of greenhouse gases—a significant driver of climate change.\n\nCurrent’s industry-leading LED products are a key component to solving many of the challenges facing customers around the world who are seeking practical and economical methods to promote and achieve energy conservation.\n\nFor example, a major retailer partnered with Current to complete a multiyear outdoor lighting retrofit project.\n\nDuring the span of the retrofit project, the retailer saved more than 3.1 billion cumulative kilowatt hours in energy consumption. What does this mean for our environment?\n\nThat’s the equivalent of:\n\nOur ability to solve some of the most difficult sustainability challenges comes from a legacy of creativity and innovation. With a wide range of capabilities, including light sensors, controls and energy-saving light products, we are able to harvest daylight to offset the need for electric lighting—reducing energy consumption.\n\nCurrent’s occupancy sensors and large array of dimming features can save up to 30% more energy for our customers.\n\nAnd our controls aren’t just for unlocking energy savings in lighting applications. We create customizable and easily deployed enterprise-wide controls software. This software enables the end user to monitor their HVAC system, control physical access to facilities and efficiently recalibrate space utilization to maximize energy conservation and promote safer environments.\n\nOur capabilities were on full display with a well-known food wholesaler in South America.\n\nThe company tapped into our innovative controls portfolio when it began its ambitious goal to obtain Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) v4 certification of its outlets. LEED v4 takes a performance-based approach to design, operations and maintenance that brings smart-grid thinking to the forefront. It rewards projects for incorporating strong demand response programs—a component that plays directly to the strengths of Current’s controls products.\n\nThe first facility the wholesaler picked to certify contained more than 48,000 square feet.

      "# [Current - HLI Brands](https://www.currentlighting.com/inspiration/camperdown-academy)\nCamperdown Academy is a school of need, not of choice. Students with language-based learning differences in grades one through eight learn how to learn, and then successfully transition back to a traditional classroom environment. With a 3:1 student to teacher ratio, individualized instruction cultivates an “I can!” attitude among students that translates to positive self-esteem and productive academic progress.\n\nWhen it opened in 1986, Camperdown Academy was the first of its kind in the Upstate of South Carolina. It was founded by a group of parents who were concerned about the lack of educational opportunities for their bright dyslexic children. The focus of the school was teaching children to compensate for their learning disability through a multi-sensory, individualized approach, with a small student to teacher ratio.\n\nThe successful formula led to the need for a new campus, which opened in August of 2018. The all LED lighting design called for high-quality products that would support the intended experience of the space, meet precise light levels in certain areas, perform as advertised and contribute to building code compliance.\n\nCurrent Lighting features a portfolio of specialized brands that have products and expertise to meet the need of any application. The size and scope of the project required the utilization of a variety of products by multiple brands for specific applications, including:\n\nThe Note 67L LED Pendant Direct from Litecontrol is being used in the collaborative areas to support a welcoming, comfortable space with the appropriate light levels conducive to reading while maintaining visual comfort. The large lobby area serves many functions, including dining.\n\nThe lighting design is driven by the needs of the space to be flexible, and the exact amount of lighting, about 800 lumens per foot, is programmed. Four and eight-foot-long pendants are being used, all featuring the Note’s architectural Bell lens. At 800 lumens per foot, these fixtures provide direct illumination in a slim, contemporary profile that deliver 133 Lumens per Watt and a 3500K color temperature. These fixtures can be dimmed when necessary.\n\nThe DLC® Premium Qualified LCAT from Columbia Lighting is being used throughout the entire footprint of the facility. The architectural appearance ensues there’s no compromise to the aesthetics of the hallways, classrooms and office spaces. The LCAT provides both design and value, with 127 Lumens per Watt, a high efficiency acrylic lens, long projected life and exceptional CRI. These fixtures can be also dimmed when necessary with 0-10V dimming.\n\nA strategic blend of emergency lights and exit signs are used throughout the facility to keep occupants safe while maintaining intended design consistency. This solution includes the SE Series exit sign from Dual-Lite, the Compass CU2 Series emergency light and the Compass CC Series combination exit/emergency fixture.\n\nDual-Lite PG is a wet location listed emergency lighting unit for indoor or outdoor use. It is designed to optimize wide area illumination patterns with no heads to aim or adjustments to make. It includes Spectron® self-testing/self-diagnostic electronics with time-delay retransfer (TDR) standard, which helps the maintenance team with automatic system testing on a monthly and semi-annual basis. The die-cast aluminum construction ensures the fixture will stand the test of time.\n\nSling from Current Outdoor Lighting is a slender, versatile and energy-efficient small wall and flood fixture that comes in four lumen outputs and two sizes. The performance of the Sling is ideal for building entrances, perimeter lighting for schools, apartment buildings or commercial applications. It is highly efficient with up to 110 Lumens per Watt and it is IP65 certified to UL 1598 for use in wet locations up to 40˚C ambient. Camperdown Academy is using the 50 Watt size two version of Sling, which offers 4000K at 70 CRI, forward throw distribution for maximum efficiency and pedestrian safety.",

It is good for you because you are low level, but later on the enchant becomes very weak and barely does any damage. It’s cool to look at visually, but if you want to actually do damage, then just focus on enchants to help out the Thundering Quiver, like Chain Reaction and Multishot. \n\nYou could also get Cooldown Shot instead of Roll Charge so that you can actually spam your artifacts.

      "# Post ID 179s3h0: Anyone know much about Godot 4's current lighting performance and culling point and spot lights? 100s of lights that \"should be cull\" seems like they are not. with +1 score by [(BlueDiamond87, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/)\nSeems Godot's performance drops pretty hard once there's 100s of punctual lights in a 3D scene using the Forward Plus Renderer.  While Unreal Engine seems to hang in there pretty well.  We're talking 30fps compared to 2 fps.  I did a quick and dirty test because I don't have a lot of time to dive deeper at the moment.  So I'm reaching out to see if others know more about it.\n\nFrom what I can tell, the number of objects, draw calls, animation and polygon count seems to be working out pretty well in G4 from the initial test I've ran and others too.\n\nThis lighting test (and maybe physics from what I've seen from others) didn't do well when pushed to a \"great\" numbers.\n\nAnyone have some insights about performance for a high multitude of lights?  If lighting performance a known issue?  Is there any estimates on which version will have it improved?\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n## Comment ID k59m7pw with +3 score by [(jmarceno, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/k59m7pw/) (in reply to ID 179s3h0):\nI've worked with Unreal for some years before coming to Godot and they work very differently. UE automatically culls things for you, without you needing to do anything. In Godot you need an occluder3d node. In UE lights can be very cheap, in Godot they can become expensive depending on how you have them configured, especially shadows. You will need to configure the max range of the lights too.\n\nAnd there is the lighting method, SDFGI is much more expensive than VoxelGI, when I changed methods in my game, it went from 90fps to 300+ (large closed scene with around a hundred lights, all casting shadows)\n\nAnd all the above may be wrong in your specific case 😬. My main point is that if you are trying to understand performance, you will need to go through the docs and read the best practices. If you just set up a scene as you would do in Unreal, my experience is that your performance will suck. Although it is important to understand that 3d performance is worse than in UE, no matter what.\n\n### Comment ID k59s0gp with +2 score by [(BlueDiamond87, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/k59s0gp/) (in reply to ID k59m7pw):\nThanks for the great reply!  If you haven't come across this post already, you might find it interesting. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/godot/s/Se2dveSoIp\n\nOthers and I have done other test, and Godot's rendering is very satisfactory in a variety of cases. And some of the other scenes I've tested, G4 seemed to perform similar or faster than UE \"out the box\" but UE does have better GI. I tested VoxelGI and SDFGI in those comparisons. Im happy enough with G4s GI solutions though. It's great FSR 2 is now in the engine, something that was a complaint stepping into G4. I believe what you're saying overall though. \n\nWhat you are saying is what I was worried about with the lighting. I really want to check it out on the source code but I have another project (in Flutter) I need to finish in my free time first :( \n\nBesides physics issues, G4 is really shaping up to be a great 3D engine. This is the first test I ran that gave me a problem. \n\nOtherwise, texture and geo streaming will be a nice feature...one day :)\n\n## Comment ID k58fq15 with +1 score by [(No_Cook_2493, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/k58fq15/) (in reply to ID 179s3h0):\nIn my 2D project I have 100s of lights with shadows going at once with no issue.

The UI looked a lot cleaner and more refined, and it had medals too. It gave a little notification in the killfeed that your team/enemy team picked up the power weapon. The animations on everything looked more realistic, like someone put a GoPro on a Spartan, that is what it would look like to me, a lot of bobbing whilst running etc. Overall, the game looked much darker, like the feeling we were getting from the initial teasers for Halo. Now it's very eh. Now I know this has nothing to do with the lighting in Halo 5, but I feel like that what happened to Halo 5's story was similar to Destiny's, that it was changed last minute for reasons. From the video of Locke and Arbiter talking in the Phantom in H2A, It seemed like Locke was REALLY going to kill Master Chief because Master Chief had really gone Rogue. His tone of voice, the lighting in the Phantom, the three other Spartans stood behind Locke lurking in the shadows, the intense music. \nTL;DR Halo 5 beta looked mint, Full game looks trash compared, also something happened to Halo 5 story but no-one cares.\n\n## Comment ID d1wahgj with +2 score by [(noseleather, Reddit, 2016-04-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/4e0l1l/beta_vs_current_lighting/d1wahgj/) (in reply to ID 4e0l1l):\nThe beta was 10x better in general.

Third party apps allow you to see and set specific values rather than guessing the color and brightness from the Home app. I think at least one of them let you copy settings from one accessory to a similar one. If the scene you want will be unchanging and used regularly, you can build it out and save it for future use.",

Their goal in d1/d2 with this move is to make the events of evilness taking over and the character themselves be the extra-ordinary events.\n\nFor example The character selection menu is a great example and summary of the problems in d4 being the same in d3. \n\nD2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZR4xWxrI3g&t=1s\n\nD3: https://i.stack.imgur.com/pdlhh.jpg\n\nD4: https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/uploads/monthly\\_2022\\_06/D4\\_Necromancer\\_Campfire\\_001.png.acf6d3f84f8248852dd662bbb3d3dfef.png\n\n**d4 suggestion** of mine (similar to d2/d1) https://i.ibb.co/HtQ3y5P/Campfire-lessfantasy3.png\n\nLook how regular trees make the scene more believable and the character pop out of the scene.\n\nThis is to show you how their mindset in d4 is wrong and still similar to diablo3, it's not believable and too high-fantasy.\n\n## Comment ID ikzyy88 with +1 score by [(atict, Reddit, 2022-08-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wsi5k1/diablo_iv_has_readability_problem_with_main/ikzyy88/) (in reply to ID wsi5k1):\nNah get gud.\n\n## Comment ID ikyeyjn with +1 score by [(lilrabbitfoofoo, Reddit, 2022-08-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wsi5k1/diablo_iv_has_readability_problem_with_main/ikyeyjn/) (in reply to ID wsi5k1):\nGlowing magical weapons that actually generate light, please. :)\n\n### Comment ID ikzse98 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-08-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wsi5k1/diablo_iv_has_readability_problem_with_main/ikzse98/) (in reply to ID ikyeyjn):\nThis is Diablo, not Frozen.\n\n#### Comment ID il0gw9j with +1 score by [(lilrabbitfoofoo, Reddit, 2022-08-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wsi5k1/diablo_iv_has_readability_problem_with_main/il0gw9j/) (in reply to ID ikzse98):\nWow, do you not understand this genre...\n\n## Comment ID ikyuzs3 with +1 score by [(Gizm00, Reddit, 2022-08-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wsi5k1/diablo_iv_has_readability_problem_with_main/ikyuzs3/) (in reply to ID wsi5k1):\ni agree with this - every gameplay, they were blending in way too much.\n\n## Comment ID ikyx3qs with +1 score by [(Sev7th, Reddit, 2022-08-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wsi5k1/diablo_iv_has_readability_problem_with_main/ikyx3qs/) (in reply to ID wsi5k1):\nWith that lighting, there's no point to the armor you ware due to it covered in shadow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID ikz31xf with +1 score by [(saltiestmanindaworld, Reddit, 2022-08-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wsi5k1/diablo_iv_has_readability_problem_with_main/ikz31xf/) (in reply to ID wsi5k1):\nAnd this is why I loathe dark/grey color schemes.\n\n## Comment ID ikzaajk with +1 score by [(Glowshroom, Reddit, 2022-08-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/wsi5k1/diablo_iv_has_readability_problem_with_main/ikzaajk/) (in reply to ID wsi5k1):\nThe balance between realism and readability is a pretty standard part of game development.

It's a bit of a pain having to set everything manually, but you only need to do it once.\n\nOnly issue is that a lot of natural language stuff is reserved by Google, so you can't just call your routine \"dim lights\" because Google will just dim every bulb it can find. So I have \"breakfast lighting\" to turn the kitchen spots to 80%, turn the under-cabinet lights on, etc, etc, or \"dressing lights\" to set the all the bulbs in the bedroom to 'daylight color & 100% brightness. \n\nAt least the routine builder now helps you set your lights, you used to have to type the equivalent voice command into a text field... 😂"

      "# [Current News: Procurement and Payment Services](https://www.northwestern.edu/procurement/about/news/)\nNew Enterprise Affinity Program for Personal Use Rentals\n\nEnterprise has a new affinity program with discounts for faculty, staff, and students for personal use car rentals. Users must be 21 to book. Enterprise has added their subsidiary Alamo Car rental to the program, giving travelers three choices of rental companies: Enterprise, National, and Alamo. Discounts will be a minimum of 5% off retail rates up to 20% off depending on factors at individual locations, like number of cars on hand at the time of booking. Enterprise recommends booking as early as possible to get the highest available discount, especially during peak rental times (holidays, summer vacation time, back-to-school time).\n\nTo receive the special Northwestern discounts, you must book personal use vehicles through the PPS Travel Website under Vehicle Rentals and follow the prompts.\n\nNew Airline Fares in Egencia\n\nA year ago, American Airlines announced that it would no longer distribute their fares through traditional distribution channels. Instead, they wished to market their fares and amenities, like baggage, WiFi, and meals, directly to the travelers through a New Distribution Channel (NDC). This new way of pricing is designed to encourage travelers to book their flights directly through the airline. Therefore, all fares are not displayed through managed travel booking tools like Egencia’s.\n\nEgencia has been working diligently to bring these, and other, NDC fares to users so that users can see the lowest fares on one platform.\n\nBecause the NDC fares are essentially coming directly from the airlines and not a middle distributor, there are some minor service issues that are being worked out as the technology evolves.\n\nWhen users book an NDC flight, users will see a notification that says, “This fare comes with limitations”. Examples of these limitations are below:\n\nLimited Egencia Travel Consultant servicing available: If you need agent assistance with a NDC flight, Egencia agents will send users to a special NDC desk at American/United Airlines.\n\nNo schedule change management and notifications: Schedule changes will be sent to the traveler directly through the airline. If users need to speak with an agent, Egencia will send users to the NDC desk at each airline.\n\nLimited Duty of Care tracking: Any changes made to an NDC flight will not be reflected through Egencia.\n\nLimited reporting and receipts available: The original itinerary will show pricing and can be used as a receipt.\n\nCredits are not possible at this time: Egencia agents can help redeem credits by working with American’s and United’s NDC desk. Travelers need to track their credits through their AA and UA accounts.\n\nMust contact airline for mobility assistance.\n\nIt is important to understand what is purchased when an NDC fare is booked so that the best decision is made when booking air travel.\n\nUsage of Credit Card for Hotel Bookings in Egencia\n\nMost hotels reserved through Egencia are booked using a Northwestern virtual credit card that is automatically assigned to each reservation. The expense for this reservation is then posted to the chart string. A small number of hotels do not accept these virtual cards, however, causing the system to ask users for a credit card to book the rooms. To understand if the hotel does or does not accept the virtual credit card, users will see one of the following options, once a hotel is selected:\n\nIf the hotel accepts the virtual card, the hotel listing will say “Paid by my company”.\n\nIf the hotel does NOT accept the virtual card, it will say “Pay online” or “Pay at Hotel”. If you choose to stay at this hotel, you will have to pay with a corporate card (if authorized) or pay with a personal card and be reimbursed.",
