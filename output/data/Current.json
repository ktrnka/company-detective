After installing Current’s LED lighting and LED luminaires, the customer’s kilowatt hour usage dropped to approximately 92,227,564.\n\nThis represents energy consumption savings of approximately 121,066,831 kilowatt hours—effectively reducing the customer’s energy consumption by more than one half.\n\nWhat does this mean for sustainability?\n\nLowering energy consumption through LED technology contributes to overall lower CO2 emissions, which is critical to reducing the production of greenhouse gases—a significant driver of climate change.\n\nCurrent’s industry-leading LED products are a key component to solving many of the challenges facing customers around the world who are seeking practical and economical methods to promote and achieve energy conservation.\n\nFor example, a major retailer partnered with Current to complete a multiyear outdoor lighting retrofit project.\n\nDuring the span of the retrofit project, the retailer saved more than 3.1 billion cumulative kilowatt hours in energy consumption. What does this mean for our environment?\n\nThat’s the equivalent of:\n\nOur ability to solve some of the most difficult sustainability challenges comes from a legacy of creativity and innovation.

We create customizable and easily deployed enterprise-wide controls software. This software enables the end user to monitor their HVAC system, control physical access to facilities and efficiently recalibrate space utilization to maximize energy conservation and promote safer environments.\n\nOur capabilities were on full display with a well-known food wholesaler in South America.\n\nThe company tapped into our innovative controls portfolio when it began its ambitious goal to obtain Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) v4 certification of its outlets. LEED v4 takes a performance-based approach to design, operations and maintenance that brings smart-grid thinking to the forefront. It rewards projects for incorporating strong demand response programs—a component that plays directly to the strengths of Current’s controls products.\n\nThe first facility the wholesaler picked to certify contained more than 48,000 square feet.

      "# [Current - HLI Brands](https://www.currentlighting.com/inspiration/camperdown-academy)\nCamperdown Academy is a school of need, not of choice. Students with language-based learning differences in grades one through eight learn how to learn, and then successfully transition back to a traditional classroom environment. With a 3:1 student to teacher ratio, individualized instruction cultivates an “I can!” attitude among students that translates to positive self-esteem and productive academic progress.\n\nWhen it opened in 1986, Camperdown Academy was the first of its kind in the Upstate of South Carolina. It was founded by a group of parents who were concerned about the lack of educational opportunities for their bright dyslexic children. The focus of the school was teaching children to compensate for their learning disability through a multi-sensory, individualized approach, with a small student to teacher ratio.\n\nThe successful formula led to the need for a new campus, which opened in August of 2018. The all LED lighting design called for high-quality products that would support the intended experience of the space, meet precise light levels in certain areas, perform as advertised and contribute to building code compliance.\n\nCurrent Lighting features a portfolio of specialized brands that have products and expertise to meet the need of any application. The size and scope of the project required the utilization of a variety of products by multiple brands for specific applications, including:\n\nThe Note 67L LED Pendant Direct from Litecontrol is being used in the collaborative areas to support a welcoming, comfortable space with the appropriate light levels conducive to reading while maintaining visual comfort. The large lobby area serves many functions, including dining.\n\nThe lighting design is driven by the needs of the space to be flexible, and the exact amount of lighting, about 800 lumens per foot, is programmed. Four and eight-foot-long pendants are being used, all featuring the Note’s architectural Bell lens. At 800 lumens per foot, these fixtures provide direct illumination in a slim, contemporary profile that deliver 133 Lumens per Watt and a 3500K color temperature. These fixtures can be dimmed when necessary.\n\nThe DLC® Premium Qualified LCAT from Columbia Lighting is being used throughout the entire footprint of the facility. The architectural appearance ensues there’s no compromise to the aesthetics of the hallways, classrooms and office spaces. The LCAT provides both design and value, with 127 Lumens per Watt, a high efficiency acrylic lens, long projected life and exceptional CRI. These fixtures can be also dimmed when necessary with 0-10V dimming.\n\nA strategic blend of emergency lights and exit signs are used throughout the facility to keep occupants safe while maintaining intended design consistency. This solution includes the SE Series exit sign from Dual-Lite, the Compass CU2 Series emergency light and the Compass CC Series combination exit/emergency fixture.\n\nDual-Lite PG is a wet location listed emergency lighting unit for indoor or outdoor use. It is designed to optimize wide area illumination patterns with no heads to aim or adjustments to make. It includes Spectron® self-testing/self-diagnostic electronics with time-delay retransfer (TDR) standard, which helps the maintenance team with automatic system testing on a monthly and semi-annual basis. The die-cast aluminum construction ensures the fixture will stand the test of time.\n\nSling from Current Outdoor Lighting is a slender, versatile and energy-efficient small wall and flood fixture that comes in four lumen outputs and two sizes. The performance of the Sling is ideal for building entrances, perimeter lighting for schools, apartment buildings or commercial applications. It is highly efficient with up to 110 Lumens per Watt and it is IP65 certified to UL 1598 for use in wet locations up to 40˚C ambient.

It is good for you because you are low level, but later on the enchant becomes very weak and barely does any damage. It’s cool to look at visually, but if you want to actually do damage, then just focus on enchants to help out the Thundering Quiver, like Chain Reaction and Multishot. \n\nYou could also get Cooldown Shot instead of Roll Charge so that you can actually spam your artifacts. And that feather isn’t doing anything if you already have Multiroll and no Cooldown Shot.\n\n### Comment ID kajtz0h with +2 score by [(bigdogdame92, Reddit, 2023-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftDungeons/comments/182m8bd/my_current_lighting_build_what_do_you_think_yall/kajtz0h/) (in reply to ID kajjolr):\nThe damage of shockweb scales with difficulty.

      "# Post ID 18n6lu4: The current lighting engine and daylight cycle necessitates night vision about 75% of the time with +42 score by [(Test_Subject_001, Reddit, 2023-12-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/theisle/comments/18n6lu4/the_current_lighting_engine_and_daylight_cycle/)\nAt first I thought I was experiencing some sort of negativity bias since I personally prefer to play during the day. But after a week of consistently logging on I couldn't ignore the fact that the vast majority of times I loaded in, I found myself in the dark. \n\nI decided to mark the time span I was able to operate without night vision, and found that the window of pure, usable daylight was only about 10:30am to 4:30pm. This means there are about 6 hours of bright playable time, and 18 hours of darkness / night vision. This is further reduced by stormy weather conditions, or being under forest canopies. \n\nI should say that I don't hate night time gameplay, even if I prefer the day. I think The Isle handles nighttime better than many other games and I appreciate that. Nonetheless a 3/1 split in favor of darkness is a bit excessive in my opinion.\n\n## Comment ID ke8unle with +26 score by [(iMaexx_Backup, Reddit, 2023-12-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/theisle/comments/18n6lu4/the_current_lighting_engine_and_daylight_cycle/ke8unle/) (in reply to ID 18n6lu4):\nAnd that’s so sad.

Im not playing any more for other reason but keep tabs.\n\nThe day/night cycle is beyond a joke, just make it like 6-6 and add in the weather cycles as intended. Theres absolutely no reason it needs to be dark and night time for as long as it is. \n\nIts also extremely damaging to the game for advertising, twitch and youtube. \n\nThe amount of isle videos i watch where the person stated they’ve done post game gamma changes to brighten night time to make it watchable. \n\nLive streams are laughable, as soon as its dark its completely unenjoyable to watch. It makes it extremely hard to boost the player base when people who are interested in the game cant even enjoy watching it first.\n\n### Comment ID kecxq8k with +3 score by [(Test_Subject_001, Reddit, 2023-12-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/theisle/comments/18n6lu4/the_current_lighting_engine_and_daylight_cycle/kecxq8k/) (in reply to ID keay1p5):\nThis is actually a really important point, I tried to pitch this game to several friends by streaming to them on Discord, all of them individually commented how every time they watch me it is dark / unpleasant to watch.\n\n## Comment ID ke924ii with +2 score by [(Thugs_of_Ember, Reddit, 2023-12-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/theisle/comments/18n6lu4/the_current_lighting_engine_and_daylight_cycle/ke924ii/) (in reply to ID 18n6lu4):\nYup however Lighting and thunder is perfect\n\n## Comment ID kedrmtx with +2 score by [(hhhnnnnnggggggg, Reddit, 2023-12-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/theisle/comments/18n6lu4/the_current_lighting_engine_and_daylight_cycle/kedrmtx/) (in reply to ID 18n6lu4):\nYeah, I feel like I need to use gamma not to cheat at night but just to see in daylight\n\n## Comment ID kea4zj8 with +1 score by [(Causualgaymr, Reddit, 2023-12-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/theisle/comments/18n6lu4/the_current_lighting_engine_and_daylight_cycle/kea4zj8/) (in reply to ID 18n6lu4):\nDillo will be the most popular carnivore for a while since it’s amazing night vision give people way more time to actually play\n\n## Comment ID kebl49f with +1 score by [(OldCanary, Reddit, 2023-12-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/theisle/comments/18n6lu4/the_current_lighting_engine_and_daylight_cycle/kebl49f/) (in reply to ID 18n6lu4):\nGot tired of starving to death as pure carnivore so went to omni but for some reason it was not able to eat grass in the dark and then died of starvation again.\n\n5.7 hours on record.\n\nLast played Dec 15 2023\n\n### Comment ID kedrv1l with +1 score by [(hhhnnnnnggggggg, Reddit, 2023-12-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/theisle/comments/18n6lu4/the_current_lighting_engine_and_daylight_cycle/kedrv1l/) (in reply to ID kebl49f):\nOmnivores can't graze\n\n## Comment ID keirb37 with +1 score by [(Master_minderrr, Reddit, 2023-12-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/theisle/comments/18n6lu4/the_current_lighting_engine_and_daylight_cycle/keirb37/) (in reply to ID 18n6lu4):\nNot a problem IMO ofc but its just lighting and if you think thats the biggest problem rn oh buddy i got something to tell ya",

While Unreal Engine seems to hang in there pretty well.  We're talking 30fps compared to 2 fps.  I did a quick and dirty test because I don't have a lot of time to dive deeper at the moment.  So I'm reaching out to see if others know more about it.\n\nFrom what I can tell, the number of objects, draw calls, animation and polygon count seems to be working out pretty well in G4 from the initial test I've ran and others too.\n\nThis lighting test (and maybe physics from what I've seen from others) didn't do well when pushed to a \"great\" numbers.\n\nAnyone have some insights about performance for a high multitude of lights?  If lighting performance a known issue?  Is there any estimates on which version will have it improved?\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n## Comment ID k59m7pw with +3 score by [(jmarceno, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/k59m7pw/) (in reply to ID 179s3h0):\nI've worked with Unreal for some years before coming to Godot and they work very differently. UE automatically culls things for you, without you needing to do anything. In Godot you need an occluder3d node. In UE lights can be very cheap, in Godot they can become expensive depending on how you have them configured, especially shadows. You will need to configure the max range of the lights too.\n\nAnd there is the lighting method, SDFGI is much more expensive than VoxelGI, when I changed methods in my game, it went from 90fps to 300+ (large closed scene with around a hundred lights, all casting shadows)\n\nAnd all the above may be wrong in your specific case 😬. My main point is that if you are trying to understand performance, you will need to go through the docs and read the best practices. If you just set up a scene as you would do in Unreal, my experience is that your performance will suck. Although it is important to understand that 3d performance is worse than in UE, no matter what.\n\n### Comment ID k59s0gp with +2 score by [(BlueDiamond87, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/k59s0gp/) (in reply to ID k59m7pw):\nThanks for the great reply!  If you haven't come across this post already, you might find it interesting. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/godot/s/Se2dveSoIp\n\nOthers and I have done other test, and Godot's rendering is very satisfactory in a variety of cases. And some of the other scenes I've tested, G4 seemed to perform similar or faster than UE \"out the box\" but UE does have better GI. I tested VoxelGI and SDFGI in those comparisons. Im happy enough with G4s GI solutions though. It's great FSR 2 is now in the engine, something that was a complaint stepping into G4. I believe what you're saying overall though. \n\nWhat you are saying is what I was worried about with the lighting. I really want to check it out on the source code but I have another project (in Flutter) I need to finish in my free time first :( \n\nBesides physics issues, G4 is really shaping up to be a great 3D engine. This is the first test I ran that gave me a problem. \n\nOtherwise, texture and geo streaming will be a nice feature...one day :)\n\n## Comment ID k58fq15 with +1 score by [(No_Cook_2493, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/k58fq15/) (in reply to ID 179s3h0):\nIn my 2D project I have 100s of lights with shadows going at once with no issue.

The company's lease at its Beachwood location on Science Park Drive ended in August, as reported by Cleveland.com.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD\n\nThe relocation is expected to bring significant economic boost to Mayfield Heights as Current cites a $10.8 million payroll. This figure represents a notable change from the company's projected payroll when it moved to Beachwood in 2022. At that time, according to the City of Beachwood, Ohio, Current was expected to bring 115 employees with an associated payroll of $14.5 million.\n\nThe Mayfield Heights city government confirmed the approval of Ordinance 2024-17, which authorizes the mayor to enter into a memorandum of understanding with Current Lighting, LLC, regarding the Job Retention and Creation Grant Program.\n\nQuestions About Current's Relocation\n\nWhen asked to clarify details surrounding Current Lighting's move to Mayfield Heights, the company offered no comment. Inquiries referenced the Cleveland.com report stating that the company’s Beachwood lease had expired in August and sought clarification on what the company has been doing in the interim. Additionally, we inquired about the reduction in Northeast Ohio payroll from $14.5 million to $10.8 million over the past two years, but the company chose not to provide further details.\n\nCurrent’s Legacy and Recent Changes\n\nCurrent's history in Northeast Ohio is extensive. The company traces its origins to General Electric's Nela Park location in East Cleveland, where it began as GE Lighting. Nela Park, recognized as the world's first industrial park and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was sold in May 2022 for $5 million to Wisconsin-based Phoenix Investors.",

      "# [Services by Julian Ee, Chad Tsubaki](https://lalights.lacity.org/residents/svc_provides.html)\nProperty owners can submit a petition that represents a majority of the properties involved to the Bureau of Street Lighting for new streetlights if a street lighting system does not exist in the neighborhood. This will initiate a new street lighting project that requires a Proposition 218 balloting procedure. Property owners are responsible for their share of the costs of installation and annual maintenance.\n\nLighting Petitions:\n\nOrnamental Lighting Petition\n\nModern Lighting Petition\n\nCurrent construction cost per 50-foot wide lot for a modern lighting system on most residential streets is approximately $5,000 â this is an estimate and special, ornamental lighting systems, or difficult construction environments are typically more expensive. Annual maintenance assessments for newly established streetlights are approximately $90 per residential property calculated in accordance to lot area acreage. Again, this may vary depending on property and special or ornamental lighting systems will result in a higher annual maintenance assessment.\n\nFor more information related to Proposition 218 see:\n\nhttps://lalights.lacity.org/residents/prop_218.html\n\nEvaluating existing street lighting systems\n\nStreet lighting systems are designed and constructed to comply with illumination and Public Works standards at the time of installation. Upon request, the Bureau of Street Lighting will make an evaluation to determine if the current street lighting system is adequate or requires an adjustment in illumination levels. Any requests for special equipment or changes that exceed the current lighting standards may require a majority petition from property owners and a funding source outside the current Street Lighting Assessment.\n\nWooden utility poles are under the jurisdiction of LADWP. A property owner can petition LADWP and request the installation of a utility light on a wooden utility pole. Where requested, a new utilitarian light may be installed if the location meets all of the following criteria:\n\n1. There is an existing wooden utility pole at the requested location.\n\n2. There is no other street light within 300 feet, or, the location is at an unlighted intersection with a wooden utility pole.\n\nTo make a request, do any of the following: Fill in and email the application form to bslutilrequest@lacity.org\n\nThe link to submit a request is the following: GeoForm (arcgis.com). An engineer in charge of the request will do a voltage drop calculation to determine if the attachment will be permitted or not.This is a calculation that determines if the additional power use of the light can be handled by the existing circuit.\n\nGlare shields are accessories for street lamps used to minimize light pollution as it relates to adjacent properties by directing light output to the desired area, preventing glare and trespass of light into unwanted spaces. Glare shields made of metal can be installed on the left, back, and right sides of an existing street light to reduce glare. A glare shield can not be installed on the front portion of the light that illuminates the street. LED lights are designed to have a beam angle and therefore usually do not have glare shields. You can request a shield through our BSL website and a determination will be made if one can be installed. The fee for a Glare Shield is $350 and must be paid by the party requesting the device.\n\nCurrently, due to COVID, the museum is open under certain circumstances and by appointment only. Please contact BSL Community Impact Division to request a tour. To view the different types of streetlights in L.A. you can also take a virtual tour of our Streetlight Museum. Please contact the Community Impact Division at: https://lalights.lacity.org/contact.html and use âGeneralâ as the subject.",

      "# [STATEMENT REGARDING LIGHTING AT ALGONQUIN ROAD SCHOOL by Jessica McKenzie](https://www.dist3.org/article/1378426)\nThe Board of Education of Fox River Grove School District #3 recently became aware of some complaints regarding the outdoor lighting at Algonquin Road School. Specifically, certain individuals within the community have alleged that the lighting is not in compliance with the applicable codes, regulations and ordinances related to school operations. In response, the District administration contacted the Village of Fox River Grove and the District’s architect to provide guidance regarding the current lighting and whether any modifications were required. To date, certain modifications have been made to the lights in the parking lot. The District will continue to work with its architect and a third-party lighting consultant to determine what, if any, additional items need to be addressed."
