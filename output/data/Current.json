It is good for you because you are low level, but later on the enchant becomes very weak and barely does any damage.

      "# Post ID 179s3h0: Anyone know much about Godot 4's current lighting performance and culling point and spot lights? 100s of lights that \"should be cull\" seems like they are not. with +1 score by [(BlueDiamond87, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/)\nSeems Godot's performance drops pretty hard once there's 100s of punctual lights in a 3D scene using the Forward Plus Renderer.  While Unreal Engine seems to hang in there pretty well.  We're talking 30fps compared to 2 fps.  I did a quick and dirty test because I don't have a lot of time to dive deeper at the moment.  So I'm reaching out to see if others know more about it.\n\nFrom what I can tell, the number of objects, draw calls, animation and polygon count seems to be working out pretty well in G4 from the initial test I've ran and others too.\n\nThis lighting test (and maybe physics from what I've seen from others) didn't do well when pushed to a \"great\" numbers.\n\nAnyone have some insights about performance for a high multitude of lights?  If lighting performance a known issue?  Is there any estimates on which version will have it improved?\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n## Comment ID k59m7pw with +3 score by [(jmarceno, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/k59m7pw/) (in reply to ID 179s3h0):\nI've worked with Unreal for some years before coming to Godot and they work very differently. UE automatically culls things for you, without you needing to do anything. In Godot you need an occluder3d node. In UE lights can be very cheap, in Godot they can become expensive depending on how you have them configured, especially shadows. You will need to configure the max range of the lights too.\n\nAnd there is the lighting method, SDFGI is much more expensive than VoxelGI, when I changed methods in my game, it went from 90fps to 300+ (large closed scene with around a hundred lights, all casting shadows)\n\nAnd all the above may be wrong in your specific case 😬. My main point is that if you are trying to understand performance, you will need to go through the docs and read the best practices. If you just set up a scene as you would do in Unreal, my experience is that your performance will suck. Although it is important to understand that 3d performance is worse than in UE, no matter what.\n\n### Comment ID k59s0gp with +2 score by [(BlueDiamond87, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/k59s0gp/) (in reply to ID k59m7pw):\nThanks for the great reply!  If you haven't come across this post already, you might find it interesting. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/godot/s/Se2dveSoIp\n\nOthers and I have done other test, and Godot's rendering is very satisfactory in a variety of cases. And some of the other scenes I've tested, G4 seemed to perform similar or faster than UE \"out the box\" but UE does have better GI. I tested VoxelGI and SDFGI in those comparisons. Im happy enough with G4s GI solutions though. It's great FSR 2 is now in the engine, something that was a complaint stepping into G4. I believe what you're saying overall though. \n\nWhat you are saying is what I was worried about with the lighting. I really want to check it out on the source code but I have another project (in Flutter) I need to finish in my free time first :( \n\nBesides physics issues, G4 is really shaping up to be a great 3D engine. This is the first test I ran that gave me a problem. \n\nOtherwise, texture and geo streaming will be a nice feature...one day :)\n\n## Comment ID k58fq15 with +1 score by [(No_Cook_2493, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/k58fq15/) (in reply to ID 179s3h0):\nIn my 2D project I have 100s of lights with shadows going at once with no issue.

Since lighting controls how you see everything in the game (because you couldn't see in the pitch-black dark), it affects how every single part of the game looks.\n\nBasically: instead of current lighting techniques like using multiple [diffuse textures](http://wiki.splashdamage.com/index.php/Diffuse_Maps)/[specular maps](http://wiki.splashdamage.com/index.php/Specular_Maps) for each part of every object in the game to represent different conditions, they can just create 1 texture for each part then artificially define properties like a [refractive index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index) to help parameterize a physics model that controls how light and shadow work when rendering frames of an in-game scene that contains that object.  \n\nIn most implementations the physics model basically uses a predictive set of converging functions to determine how light from a specific source will reflect/refract off a given surface with different reflectivity and absorption/diffusion characteristics, which then refracts and reflects off other surfaces at a) different angles, with b) reduced intensity and c) a different wavelength, etc.\n\nIn productivity terms: people creating textures for in-game assets now have to spend less time creating multiple maps for each surface because they can just say \"this panel is steel\" or \"this seat cushion is leather\" with specific reflectivity/diffusion/texture/etc. rather than having to create multiple different copies of them that behave differently under different lighting conditions (such as in space, in atmosphere, indoors, etc.)\n\nIn visual terms: different types of surfaces (such as metal, leather, plastic, glass, etc.) should look more photorealistic and more \"natural\" because the way that light reflects off them and the way shadows are created will be more accurate.\n\n### Comment ID cdodsd1 with +15 score by [(HSAR, Reddit, 2013-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1rl7bq/could_somebody_please_explain_physical_based/cdodsd1/) (in reply to ID cdoc9r3):\nA great explanation here, especially as it's hard to find good documentation on it.\n\nFor the most part, I can't understand how this doesn't result in a huge performance hit since this is doing the job of diffuse, specular and environment mapping all at once (and ambient occlusion/global illumination, to a lesser degree).\n\nCutting-edge, indeed.\n\n#### Comment ID cfdmy4f with +5 score by [(SirDigbyChknCaesar, Reddit, 2014-02-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1rl7bq/could_somebody_please_explain_physical_based/cfdmy4f/) (in reply to ID cdodsd1):\nI think it's just an easier way to perform similar lighting functions that already exist.

This is not an artist's conception anymore, it is a numerical simulation. The light sources start in the calculation by emitting with a specific distribution, and the simulation computes the reflections between surfaces until the solution converges. The most popular technique for this computation is usually referred to as \"radiosity\", or flux transfer, and it does this by dividing all the surfaces into patches that exchange light energy within a closed system. This type of calculation is limited for the most part to simple scenes with diffuse surfaces where the visibility calculation and the solution matrix are manageable.\"\n\n### Comment ID cdocvn2 with +4 score by [(Ortekk, Reddit, 2013-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1rl7bq/could_somebody_please_explain_physical_based/cdocvn2/) (in reply to ID cdoc5q0):\nI take it as if I light up a surface, lets say it's red, it will cast of red light around the area?\n\nAnd depending on how the surface looks it spreads the light as it would in real life?

Third party apps allow you to see and set specific values rather than guessing the color and brightness from the Home app. I think at least one of them let you copy settings from one accessory to a similar one. If the scene you want will be unchanging and used regularly, you can build it out and save it for future use."
