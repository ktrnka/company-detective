  "summary_markdown": "# About Current\n\nCurrent Lighting, also known as GE Current, a Daintree Company, was founded on January 1, 2015 [(Crunchbase, 2024)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/current-powered-by-ge). The company specializes in electronics manufacturing, focusing on LED technology integrated with networked sensors and software. This enables various environments, such as commercial buildings, retail stores, industrial facilities, and cities, to optimize energy usage efficiently [(Crunchbase, 2024)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/current-powered-by-ge).\n\nCurrent Lighting operates primarily in the B2B sector, serving a diverse clientele that includes commercial businesses, industrial facilities, residential clients, and government agencies. The company generates significant revenue, estimated to be between $100 million and $1 billion annually [(Current Lighting Company Overview, 2023)](https://leadiq.com/c/current-lighting/632b3605ae533e083f827523). The company's products are distributed through strategic partnerships and a robust sales organization, emphasizing marketing and distributor relationships [(Current Lighting Archives, 2023)](https://electricaltrends.com/tag/current-lighting/).\n\nOver time, Current Lighting has expanded its operations, including opening new offices in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, to enhance its market presence [(Current Lighting Company Overview, 2023)](https://leadiq.com/c/current-lighting/632b3605ae533e083f827523). The company is positioned against larger competitors like Acuity Brands, which presents opportunities for unique value propositions to capture market share [(Current Lighting Company Overview, 2023)](https://leadiq.com/c/current-lighting/632b3605ae533e083f827523).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nCurrent Lighting's leadership team has recently undergone changes, with William Tolley appointed as the Interim CEO following the departure of Manish Bhandari [(Current Lighting Archives, 2023)](https://electricaltrends.com/tag/current-lighting/). This change in leadership may indicate a strategic shift or new focus for the company.\n\n# News\n\n## Strategic Partnerships and Developments\n\nCurrent Lighting has been proactive in forming strategic partnerships to foster innovation and expand its market reach. Notable collaborations include those with Control Solutions LLC and DemandJump Inc. [(Current Lighting Company Overview, 2023)](https://leadiq.com/c/current-lighting/632b3605ae533e083f827523). The company has also strengthened its sales organization by making new hires, highlighting the importance of marketing and distributor relationships [(Current Lighting Archives, 2023)](https://electricaltrends.com/tag/current-lighting/).\n\n## Product Innovations\n\nThe company offers a wide range of LED commercial lighting solutions designed to improve lighting quality, safety, productivity, and energy efficiency [(Commercial Lighting and Lighting Controls, 2023)](https://www.currentlighting.com/). A notable product is the A2LED architectural adjustable lighting, which is versatile and energy-efficient, suitable for various applications such as retail and institutional settings [(A2LED Indoor Lighting, 2023)](https://www.currentlighting.com/indoor-lighting/a2led/212796).\n\n### A2LED Specifications\n\n- **Lumen Range**: 700 - 1,200\n- **Wattage Range**: 12 - 20\n- **Dimming Protocol**: 0-10V Dimming\n- **Color Temperature (CCT)**: 2700K, 3000K, 3500K, 4000K\n- **Color Rendering Index (CRI)**: 80, 90\n- **Warranty**: 5 years limited\n- **Lumen Maintenance Rating**: L70 @ 50,000 hours [(A2LED Indoor Lighting, 2023)](https://www.currentlighting.com/indoor-lighting/a2led/212796).\n\n## Employee Relations\n\nCurrent Lighting has faced challenges in employee relations, particularly at its Christiansburg plant, where workers have rallied over contract negotiations. Union representatives have expressed dissatisfaction due to the lack of raises over the past two years and the expiration of their contract. A mediator from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service is expected to assist in the negotiations [(Employees rally over contract at Christiansburg's Current Lighting, 2024)](https://roanoke.com/news/local/business/employees-rally-over-contract-at-christiansburgs-current-lighting/article_0ecf1a6c-e570-11ee-88d0-2386d00b8887.html). This situation could impact employee morale and productivity, which are crucial for the company's success.\n\n## Industry Context\n\nThe lighting industry is experiencing significant growth, with trends indicating a rise in the LED driver market and human-centric lighting solutions. The global LED driver market is projected to exceed USD 60.8 billion by 2032, with a CAGR of 20.2% [(None, 2024-02-07)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-led-driver-market-size-100000008.html). Additionally, the human-centric lighting market is set to soar past USD 8.18 billion by 2030 [(None, 2024-02-29)](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/02/26/2835291/0/en/Human-Centric-Lighting-Market-Set-to-Soar-Past-USD-8-18-Billion-by-2030-Skyquest-Technology.html).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCurrent Lighting is a strong contender in the commercial lighting industry, with substantial revenue potential and a commitment to innovation through strategic partnerships and product development. However, the company must address employee relations challenges to maintain its competitive edge and ensure a motivated workforce. Prospective candidates and investors should weigh both the growth opportunities and potential risks associated with Current Lighting's current landscape.",

It is good for you because you are low level, but later on the enchant becomes very weak and barely does any damage. It’s cool to look at visually, but if you want to actually do damage, then just focus on enchants to help out the Thundering Quiver, like Chain Reaction and Multishot. \n\nYou could also get Cooldown Shot instead of Roll Charge so that you can actually spam your artifacts. And that feather isn’t doing anything if you already have Multiroll and no Cooldown Shot.\n\n### Comment ID kajtz0h with +2 score by [(bigdogdame92, Reddit, 2023-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftDungeons/comments/182m8bd/my_current_lighting_build_what_do_you_think_yall/kajtz0h/) (in reply to ID kajjolr):\nThe damage of shockweb scales with difficulty.

      "# Post ID 179s3h0: Anyone know much about Godot 4's current lighting performance and culling point and spot lights? 100s of lights that \"should be cull\" seems like they are not. with +1 score by [(BlueDiamond87, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/)\nSeems Godot's performance drops pretty hard once there's 100s of punctual lights in a 3D scene using the Forward Plus Renderer.  While Unreal Engine seems to hang in there pretty well.  We're talking 30fps compared to 2 fps.  I did a quick and dirty test because I don't have a lot of time to dive deeper at the moment.  So I'm reaching out to see if others know more about it.\n\nFrom what I can tell, the number of objects, draw calls, animation and polygon count seems to be working out pretty well in G4 from the initial test I've ran and others too.\n\nThis lighting test (and maybe physics from what I've seen from others) didn't do well when pushed to a \"great\" numbers.\n\nAnyone have some insights about performance for a high multitude of lights?  If lighting performance a known issue?  Is there any estimates on which version will have it improved?\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n## Comment ID k59m7pw with +3 score by [(jmarceno, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/k59m7pw/) (in reply to ID 179s3h0):\nI've worked with Unreal for some years before coming to Godot and they work very differently. UE automatically culls things for you, without you needing to do anything. In Godot you need an occluder3d node. In UE lights can be very cheap, in Godot they can become expensive depending on how you have them configured, especially shadows. You will need to configure the max range of the lights too.\n\nAnd there is the lighting method, SDFGI is much more expensive than VoxelGI, when I changed methods in my game, it went from 90fps to 300+ (large closed scene with around a hundred lights, all casting shadows)\n\nAnd all the above may be wrong in your specific case 😬. My main point is that if you are trying to understand performance, you will need to go through the docs and read the best practices. If you just set up a scene as you would do in Unreal, my experience is that your performance will suck. Although it is important to understand that 3d performance is worse than in UE, no matter what.\n\n### Comment ID k59s0gp with +2 score by [(BlueDiamond87, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/k59s0gp/) (in reply to ID k59m7pw):\nThanks for the great reply!  If you haven't come across this post already, you might find it interesting. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/godot/s/Se2dveSoIp\n\nOthers and I have done other test, and Godot's rendering is very satisfactory in a variety of cases. And some of the other scenes I've tested, G4 seemed to perform similar or faster than UE \"out the box\" but UE does have better GI. I tested VoxelGI and SDFGI in those comparisons. Im happy enough with G4s GI solutions though. It's great FSR 2 is now in the engine, something that was a complaint stepping into G4. I believe what you're saying overall though. \n\nWhat you are saying is what I was worried about with the lighting. I really want to check it out on the source code but I have another project (in Flutter) I need to finish in my free time first :( \n\nBesides physics issues, G4 is really shaping up to be a great 3D engine. This is the first test I ran that gave me a problem. \n\nOtherwise, texture and geo streaming will be a nice feature...one day :)\n\n## Comment ID k58fq15 with +1 score by [(No_Cook_2493, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/k58fq15/) (in reply to ID 179s3h0):\nIn my 2D project I have 100s of lights with shadows going at once with no issue.

Pull the wire out of the box and move it aside. Get a remodel 6in can light housing from Home Depot. Make certain it has the paper template inside of the can light. Put the template up against the ceiling making certain there is nothing like a joist or pipe in the way. Trace and cut out. Make certain to not go outside your traces lines. Pull the wire out of the ceiling(might be stapled so remove the staple to free up the wire). Knockout the prefabricated hole it the can light junction box, add the connector in the hole. Jam the wire through the connector. Green to green or bare cu, White to white and black to black. Close up junction box and push the can light into the hole you cut. Hold the can in the hole and push the black metal tabs in. Once the can holds use a small flathead screwdriver find a lip on the black tabs and bump the tabs up to hold it solid into place.\n\nMake sure the can light housing you get has the screw type bulb fitting not just the led wire connector. This will give you more versatility with what you want to install.\n\nI am in no way telling you to do this but if I had to do this that’s how I would do it... cough.

These partnerships are aimed at fostering innovation and expanding market reach [(Current Lighting Company Overview, 2023)](https://leadiq.com/c/current-lighting/632b3605ae533e083f827523). Additionally, the company has made recent hires to bolster its sales organization, emphasizing the importance of marketing and distributor relationships [(Current Lighting Archives, 2023)](https://electricaltrends.com/tag/current-lighting/).\n\n## Product Overview\n\nCurrent Lighting offers a diverse portfolio of LED commercial lighting solutions designed to enhance lighting quality, safety, productivity, and energy efficiency [(Commercial Lighting and Lighting Controls, 2023)](https://www.currentlighting.com/). One of their notable products is the A2LED architectural adjustable lighting, which is suitable for various applications, including retail and institutional settings.
