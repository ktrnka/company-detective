      "# Post ID 179s3h0: Anyone know much about Godot 4's current lighting performance and culling point and spot lights? 100s of lights that \"should be cull\" seems like they are not. with +1 score by [(BlueDiamond87, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/)\nSeems Godot's performance drops pretty hard once there's 100s of punctual lights in a 3D scene using the Forward Plus Renderer.  While Unreal Engine seems to hang in there pretty well.  We're talking 30fps compared to 2 fps.  I did a quick and dirty test because I don't have a lot of time to dive deeper at the moment.  So I'm reaching out to see if others know more about it.\n\nFrom what I can tell, the number of objects, draw calls, animation and polygon count seems to be working out pretty well in G4 from the initial test I've ran and others too.\n\nThis lighting test (and maybe physics from what I've seen from others) didn't do well when pushed to a \"great\" numbers.\n\nAnyone have some insights about performance for a high multitude of lights?  If lighting performance a known issue?  Is there any estimates on which version will have it improved?\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n## Comment ID k59m7pw with +3 score by [(jmarceno, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/k59m7pw/) (in reply to ID 179s3h0):\nI've worked with Unreal for some years before coming to Godot and they work very differently. UE automatically culls things for you, without you needing to do anything. In Godot you need an occluder3d node. In UE lights can be very cheap, in Godot they can become expensive depending on how you have them configured, especially shadows. You will need to configure the max range of the lights too.\n\nAnd there is the lighting method, SDFGI is much more expensive than VoxelGI, when I changed methods in my game, it went from 90fps to 300+ (large closed scene with around a hundred lights, all casting shadows)\n\nAnd all the above may be wrong in your specific case 😬. My main point is that if you are trying to understand performance, you will need to go through the docs and read the best practices. If you just set up a scene as you would do in Unreal, my experience is that your performance will suck. Although it is important to understand that 3d performance is worse than in UE, no matter what.\n\n### Comment ID k59s0gp with +3 score by [(BlueDiamond87, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/k59s0gp/) (in reply to ID k59m7pw):\nThanks for the great reply!  If you haven't come across this post already, you might find it interesting. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/godot/s/Se2dveSoIp\n\nOthers and I have done other test, and Godot's rendering is very satisfactory in a variety of cases. And some of the other scenes I've tested, G4 seemed to perform similar or faster than UE \"out the box\" but UE does have better GI. I tested VoxelGI and SDFGI in those comparisons. Im happy enough with G4s GI solutions though. It's great FSR 2 is now in the engine, something that was a complaint stepping into G4. I believe what you're saying overall though. \n\nWhat you are saying is what I was worried about with the lighting. I really want to check it out on the source code but I have another project (in Flutter) I need to finish in my free time first :( \n\nBesides physics issues, G4 is really shaping up to be a great 3D engine. This is the first test I ran that gave me a problem. \n\nOtherwise, texture and geo streaming will be a nice feature...one day :)\n\n## Comment ID k58fq15 with +1 score by [(No_Cook_2493, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/k58fq15/) (in reply to ID 179s3h0):\nIn my 2D project I have 100s of lights with shadows going at once with no issue.

It is good for you because you are low level, but later on the enchant becomes very weak and barely does any damage.

Since lighting controls how you see everything in the game (because you couldn't see in the pitch-black dark), it affects how every single part of the game looks.\n\nBasically: instead of current lighting techniques like using multiple [diffuse textures](http://wiki.splashdamage.com/index.php/Diffuse_Maps)/[specular maps](http://wiki.splashdamage.com/index.php/Specular_Maps) for each part of every object in the game to represent different conditions, they can just create 1 texture for each part then artificially define properties like a [refractive index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index) to help parameterize a physics model that controls how light and shadow work when rendering frames of an in-game scene that contains that object.  \n\nIn most implementations the physics model basically uses a predictive set of converging functions to determine how light from a specific source will reflect/refract off a given surface with different reflectivity and absorption/diffusion characteristics, which then refracts and reflects off other surfaces at a) different angles, with b) reduced intensity and c) a different wavelength, etc.\n\nIn productivity terms: people creating textures for in-game assets now have to spend less time creating multiple maps for each surface because they can just say \"this panel is steel\" or \"this seat cushion is leather\" with specific reflectivity/diffusion/texture/etc. rather than having to create multiple different copies of them that behave differently under different lighting conditions (such as in space, in atmosphere, indoors, etc.)\n\nIn visual terms: different types of surfaces (such as metal, leather, plastic, glass, etc.) should look more photorealistic and more \"natural\" because the way that light reflects off them and the way shadows are created will be more accurate.\n\n### Comment ID cdodsd1 with +15 score by [(HSAR, Reddit, 2013-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1rl7bq/could_somebody_please_explain_physical_based/cdodsd1/) (in reply to ID cdoc9r3):\nA great explanation here, especially as it's hard to find good documentation on it.\n\nFor the most part, I can't understand how this doesn't result in a huge performance hit since this is doing the job of diffuse, specular and environment mapping all at once (and ambient occlusion/global illumination, to a lesser degree).\n\nCutting-edge, indeed.\n\n#### Comment ID cfdmy4f with +6 score by [(SirDigbyChknCaesar, Reddit, 2014-02-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1rl7bq/could_somebody_please_explain_physical_based/cfdmy4f/) (in reply to ID cdodsd1):\nI think it's just an easier way to perform similar lighting functions that already exist.

This is not an artist's conception anymore, it is a numerical simulation. The light sources start in the calculation by emitting with a specific distribution, and the simulation computes the reflections between surfaces until the solution converges. The most popular technique for this computation is usually referred to as \"radiosity\", or flux transfer, and it does this by dividing all the surfaces into patches that exchange light energy within a closed system. This type of calculation is limited for the most part to simple scenes with diffuse surfaces where the visibility calculation and the solution matrix are manageable.\"\n\n### Comment ID cdocvn2 with +3 score by [(Ortekk, Reddit, 2013-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1rl7bq/could_somebody_please_explain_physical_based/cdocvn2/) (in reply to ID cdoc5q0):\nI take it as if I light up a surface, lets say it's red, it will cast of red light around the area?\n\nAnd depending on how the surface looks it spreads the light as it would in real life?

      "# [Streetlight Acquisition & Conversion on 2023-12-19](https://bouldercolorado.gov/projects/streetlight-acquisition)\nStreetlights Conversion Map\n\nWhy convert streetlights?\n\nResponsible stewardship of community funds\n\nProvides for the safety and comfort needs of all community members. We previously paid Xcel Energy for streetlight services. These costs have risen significantly. While we had no way to control costs, we were responsible for all costs Xcel incurred. We will save money now that we have acquired the lights and brought them into city control. The project has the potential to see a return on investment within seven years. We will save or reinvest an estimated 1 million per year in operational and maintenance costs.\n\nEnvironment\n\nMany of the streetlights previously owned by Xcel Energy use outdated technology, that is inefficient and provides a lower-quality light. Newer technology, called Light Emitting Diode or LEDs are efficient, dimmable, and provide better light quality along with energy and greenhouse gas reductions. Since LED lights are much more efficient than the lights in current streetlights, we estimate that by converting all city streetlights, we can reduce emissions by about 1,000 metric tons of carbon — which is roughly equivalent to taking 254 gas vehicles off the road.\n\nReliability improvements\n\nHigh-performing and reliable streetlights can self-report outages. Current streetlights don't automatically notify the City when they are out. People must report an outage to get lights fixed or replaced. This system leads to unnecessary, prolonged outages. By purchasing the lights from Xcel, we can now convert them to new technology that automatically lets us know when lights need repairs or replacement.\n\nStay connected\n\nSign up for the city’s Climate Initiatives and Transportation and Mobility e-newsletters for monthly updates on projects and other relevant news.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nStreetlights include lights that are above the public right of way, such as public streets.\n\nThe city does not own or maintain area lights, which are lights over private property, such as at condos or parking lots.\n\nIf there is an issue with a streetlight within city limits, you can make a service request on Inquire Boulder. Your ticket will be closed on Inquire Boulder once we document your request into the maintenance system. Depending on the location and LED conversion timeline, response times may vary from a few weeks to a few months during this transition period. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work through this important upgrade to our streetlighting system.\n\nThe decision was based on what we heard from the community, feedback from Community Connectors, data on costs and efficiency, and other technical considerations.\n\nCommunity Engagement\n\nCommunity engagement is a key part of this project. In 2023, the community weighed in on the selection of the new LED color temperatures — how warm or cool a light appears. Overwhelmingly, participants indicated their preference for warmer lighting at 2700 Kelvin, a conclusion additionally supported by best practices and technical analyses. View a summary of the streetlight color temperatures our community cares about.\n\nWhat do people in Boulder think about streetlights?\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nA consultant that specializes in lighting prepared a comprehensive photometric analysis of the entire streetlight system to ensure that the converted streetlights will properly illuminate roads and sidewalks. This work considered the street layout, pole locations, mounting height, street classification and pedestrian activity for identifying the proper luminaire, or fixture, and target lighting levels. The selection of the proper luminaire encompasses both a wattage/lumen output (quantity of light output) and the distribution type (area of lighting) specification. This includes selecting distribution types to maximize the light on streets and minimize light trespass. The target lighting levels are based on the RP-8 (Recommended Practices for Lighting of Roadways) which is published by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) and is considered the industry’s best practice approach.\n\nWhile the new lights may appear brighter and may take some time to get used to, the newly installed LEDs have comparable lumens to the previous HPS lights.\n\nThe previous lighting provided by Xcel Energy did not meet current lighting standards. The older lighting was far below recommended photometric standards and inconsistent with our citywide initiatives. The target lighting levels are now based on national best practices. Boulder has many older lights, some of which have reached the end of their lifespan and have even turned off entirely, which is another reason why these LEDs seem brighter than what everyone is used to.\n\nA consultant that specializes in lighting prepared a comprehensive photometric analysis of the entire streetlight system. For each streetlight, the analysis identified the type of LED design required, along with the need for shields. The design considered various factors described in the FAQs and we will continue to support these photometric results. Shields will be provided for locations that the photometric analysis identified.\n\nWe recognize that the brightness of the streetlight may feel different from what you are used to. We kindly ask our community to allow some time to adjust to the new LED streetlights.\n\nYes. 3,000K and below is considered dark sky compliant. Additionally, streetlights are one of several exemptions from the outdoor lighting ordinance, as this regulation applies specifically to private property lighting. Streetlights are public lighting, located within the right-of-way. They are essential for maintaining safety on the roads for all forms of transportation.\n\nLEDs offer improved visibility, better color rendering and higher uniformity compared to the previous HPS lights. The LEDs will also help address certain dark spots in the city.\n\nThere are about 5,100 city-owned streetlights.\n\nXcel Energy previously owned and operated about 4,500 of these streetlights while the city owned and operated 600.\n\nColor temperature is how warm or cool a light is, such as whether it appears yellower or bluer. LEDs come in a range of color temperatures.\n\nIn 2023, the community weighed in on the selection of the new LED color temperatures. The pilot included: 2,200K, 2,700K, 3,000K, 4,000K. Overwhelmingly, participants indicated their preference for warmer lighting at 2700 Kelvin, a conclusion additionally supported by best practices and technical analyses. 3,000K and below is considered dark sky compliant. We selected the second lowest of the commonly available product color temperature options (2700k). We will replace lights with this warmer color temperature moving forward.\n\nMost city-owned streetlights will be converted. A few city streetlights will be converted at a later time in the project due to additional complexities, including the types of streetlight fixtures. This includes Pearl Street streetlights.\n\nWe have a map showing where streetlights will be converted.\n\nStreetlight Conversion Map\n\nStreetlight points will appear on the map as they are converted to an LED. There may be several crews working on the light at different times, so there may be delays before a streetlight is marked completed on the map.\n\nWe will gradually convert streetlights during two phases over several years to responsibly fund the project and to work with our contractor’s planned construction schedule.\n\nThe phases prioritize key transportation and equity considerations in the city. The first phase will take place near Boulder’s priority Core Arterial Network initiative, the connected system of transportation improvements along Boulder’s main corridors that will make it safer, more comfortable and convenient for people to get where they need to go no matter how they travel.\n\nThere will be several benefits to our community:\n\nSmart technology to support automated real-time outage reporting to improve response times and support preventative maintenance.\n\nNew dark-sky-friendly light fixtures that will keep light focused where it is needed and reduce spillover affecting night-sky viewing and wildlife, such as migratory birds.\n\nCost-savings over time.\n\nAdditionally, we recognize that the conversion process may have an impact on people who use the street. Before installing new LEDs, we will work to notify impacted community members. There may be different impacts depending on the location:\n\nInstallations may temporarily impact streets, sidewalks, bike lanes and street parking. There may be moving lane closures on major roads. Traffic and on-street parking may be temporarily disrupted in the work area. If parking restrictions are needed, we will post “no parking” signs 72 hours in advance of the work.\n\nIn other locations, we may need to install new electrical infrastructure for the separation or connection of lights in the right of way, which may impact private property.\n\nThe installation, maintenance and removal of streetlights will comply with all city requirements including dust control, work zone safety, and landscaping restoration.\n\nThe streetlight conversion will be a one-for-one replacement. Evaluating the number of streetlights and streetlight locations is not part of this project phase and will take place during a future city process. Currently, this work is anticipated to begin in 2028.\n\nWe provide corridor-style lighting on major streets, which is when there is regular spacing between streetlights. On collector streets, which are streets that move traffic from smaller streets to arterial roads, streetlighting is provided at intersections and busy crossings for people walking and biking.\n\nStreetlighting is normally not provided on local streets except at busy crossings.\n\nThere are very limited financial resources for installing new city streetlights. Requests are evaluated and prioritized. Considerations include adequate visibility for safe travel, energy consumption, operating cost and maintaining dark skies.\n\nGiven the cost savings associated with city ownership, reduced energy costs and other efficiencies, we estimate we can save $1 million per year in operational and maintenance costs. The project would get a return on investment within 6.8 years.\n\nConverting streetlights to city ownership and operation will support community goals reflected in the Sustainability, Equity and Resilience Framework (PDF), including toward safety, saving money and reducing emissions. Savings will be reinvested into streetlights.",
      "# [Active List of U.S. States Banning Fluorescent Lights](https://www.pecnw.com/blog/active-list-of-us-states-banning-fluorescent-lights/)\nAcross the United States, a significant shift towards more sustainable lighting options is underway as an increasing number of states have either enacted or set to officially enact bans on the sale of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and linear fluorescent tubes (T8, T5, T12).\n\nBelow is an active list of U.S. states enacting bans, as well as their respective phase out dates for the sale, offer, or distribution of screw-base, bayonet-base, and pin-base CFLs, as well as linear fluorescent tubes.\n\nCommercial customers in California may also qualify for On-Bill Financing (OBF), depending on their utility provider.\n\nOBF is a fantastic option for eligible projects, allowing customers to make interest payments as low as 0% towards their project on their monthly utility bills.\n\nThe major benefit is that the payments are made with the energy savings captured from the LED upgrade, giving participants a state-of-the-art lighting system that provides long-term energy savings — without needing to allocate any capital.\n\nConnect with our team to discuss if OBF programs are available in your service territory.\n\nAccording to Inside Lighting, the new legislation outlines a comprehensive enforcement mechanism to oversee compliance. The executive director of the state Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) will conduct a verification at least once before January 1, 2026, and again before January 1, 2031, and deliver a report on the method and findings to the Energy and Environment Committee of the House of Representatives and the Transportation and Energy Committee of the Senate. The report will also be posted on the CDPHE’s website within a month after completion.\n\nThe penalties for businesses that fall out of compliance can be substantial:\n\nCivil penalties of up to $500 per violation may be imposed.\n\nEach transaction or online for-sale product listing constitutes a separate violation.\n\nThe maximum penalty for any related series of violations is capped at $500,000.\n\nLegislation source: nysenate.gov\n\nIn June 2023, New York signed and enacted Assembly Bill A10439, enforcing a manufacturing ban on the sale of high CRI (color rendering index), cold temperature, and impact-resistant linear fluorescent lamps that do not meet the current Federal Department of Energy’s efficiency requirements.\n\nAccording to Phillips, any covered lamps manufactured before June 26, 2023, can be sold in the state of New York. Any covered lamps manufactured on or after June 26, 2023, cannot be sold in the state of New York unless they meet the DOE efficiency requirements. A similar manufacturing ban (but only applying to high CRI lamps) began in Oregon on January 1, 2023.\n\nIn July of 2023, the New York Public Service Commission filed an order (Case 18-M-0084) that will eliminate all utility incentive programs for LED lighting upgrades starting in 2026.\n\nCommercial customers of NYSEG and RG&E have the opportunity to capitalize on a Limited Time Year-End Bonus promotion for incentives to be applied towards energy efficiency projects.\n\nEnergy incentives have historically been an extremely valuable resource for LED lighting retrofits, allowing businesses to access funds that often cover substantial portions of the total project cost.\n\nEnergy Trust of Oregon (ETO), one of the top incentive program administrators in the state, has already announced that they will be discontinuing their incentives available for LED Lighting upgrades once bans take effect.\n\nCurrent plans are to keep the incentive for the replacement of pin-base CFL and linear fluorescent tubes in place until July 1, 2025 (or until funds run out)!\n\nAccording to FastDemocracy, the bill was introduced in February 2023 and was signed into law on June 22, 2023.\n\nWhile exact penalties for non-compliance are unclear, the bill states that “Violations of this act would result in civil penalties as enforced by the Department of Environmental Management (DEM).”\n\nSource: dec.vermont.gov\n\nIn November 2023, the state of Vermont enacted a new law that began prohibiting the sales of specific mercury-containing fluorescent lighting bulbs.\n\nIn November 2022, Vermont became the first US state to place bans on the sale or distribution of screw-base CFL bulbs, according to The Hill.\n\nThe legislation introduced in 2023, Act 120, introduced an additional ban specifically on 4-foot fluorescent lamps, bringing the state total bans and effective dates to the following:\n\nScrew-base & bayonet-base CFL: Ban effective February 17, 2023\n\nLinear fluorescent tube (4-foot lamps): Ban effective January 1, 2024\n\nThe first date noted is the sales prohibition start date for new installations. The second date (if noted) is the end of the replacement lamp exemption period. Replacement lamps can only be used in fixtures installed before the bans starts.\n\nThese states are just the beginning, with others expected to announce their own regulations soon.\n\nFluorescent lights, once a common sight in offices and industrial facilities, contain mercury — a toxic heavy metal that is used in CFLs to help them emit light more efficiently.\n\nWhen CFLs break during disposal, that mercury is released into the atmosphere, it is capable of traveling hundreds of miles before depositing into the Earth’s surface. These mercury deposits put both humans and animals at risk of mercury exposure and consumption, which has been shown to cause severe health issues.\n\nThis also creates serious (and costly) waste disposal challenges.\n\nOn top of the mercury concerns, fluorescents are substantially less efficient than LED technology — leading to excessive energy waste.\n\nThis waste creates a lose-lose scenario for both businesses and the environment: the business endures steep energy bills to power a low-performing, high-maintenance lighting system, while the environment endures excessive carbon being released into the atmosphere.\n\nIn terms of maintenance, LED fixtures also offer a significant boost to a fixture’s life expectancy, with high-quality products offering lifespans of 100,000+ hours.\n\nThese factors contribute to the growing consensus that moving away from fluorescent lighting is both an environmental imperative and an economic advantage, leading to the increasing popularity of states instilling sunset timelines for fluorescents.\n\nIncentive & Rebate programs have historically been a significant cost benefit for businesses transitioning to LED — often covering 50%-100% of the total project cost for the LED upgrade, depending on the program and available funds.\n\nThese programs, which are typically offered through utility providers, were put in place to drive greater adoption of energy-efficient technologies (like LED) in an effort to relieve heavy strains being placed on the electrical grid.\n\nHowever, as fluorescent falls out of compliance, several utility providers have already announced plans to discontinue their incentives available for LED once bans take effect.\n\nBusinesses should strongly consider taking advantage of these programs while they are still in place before they expire, as they will be required to make the transition to LED regardless.\n\nRetrofitting existing fixtures to accommodate new technologies, such as LED, can represent a daunting investment — but it can also be a major opportunity if handled with care and long-term consideration. Finding the right LED upgrade for your facility can reduce energy spending by up to 80%, provide payback periods of under 3 years, slash carbon emissions, and dramatically improve the safety and overall environment for employees! Here are some key things to keep in mind to maximize impact on your LED transition:\n\nBeyond the ability to provide more light with less energy, modern LED technology has an improved ability to direct light, leveraging sophisticated optics to distribute light throughout a space in the most energy-efficient manner. Settling for 1:1 fixture replacements may lead to excessive energy consumption, over-lighting your space, and create “hot spots” that lead to visibility challenges for employees.\n\nTubular LED technology can be traced back to the early 2000s at a time when the development of white LEDs made it possible to use LEDs for general lighting. Traditionally designed to be a retrofit replacement for fluorescent tubes in compatible luminaries, LED tubes (TLEDs) were an attractive option offering significant cost and energy savings. When specified and installed correctly, they can reduce electricity consumption by over 50% compared to T8 fluorescent lamp technology.\n\nHowever, understand the safety concerns with TLED bulb swaps.\n\nWe have heard a number of stories from customers who came to us after having bad experiences with TLEDs and substandard LED “solutions” — including severe fires that led to costly production shutdowns.\n\nSee some of the cautionary TLED tales in our blog here »\n\nAs LED has become increasingly more affordable to manufacture, the LED market has become incredibly saturated with new-entrant brands that over-promise and under-deliver. In fact, many manufacturers will offer the same performance criteria on the spec sheet, have a price tag that reflects top-shelf performance, but never have been actually battle-tested in the field — ultimately leading to failures and performance issues down the road.\n\nA big advantage of working with a solution expert like PEC is that we work with clients as a vendor-agnostic service provider. This means that when we design a project, we put together a mix of lumen package options and walk our clients through the pros and cons of each. We help you correlate price and performance, incorporating quality-assured fixture options that we have used in our experience of over +8,000 projects.\n\nLED lighting retrofits make for attractive investments because you can confidently predict your future energy savings and cashflows.\n\nThis is done through an energy audit and photometric analysis.
