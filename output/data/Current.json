This trend is driven by the environmental and economic benefits of LEDs, such as longer lifespans and reduced energy consumption [(PECNW, Active List of U.S. States Banning Fluorescent Lights)](https://www.pecnw.com/blog/active-list-of-us-states-banning-fluorescent-lights/).\n\n## Historical News\n\n- **Acquisition by American Industrial Partners**: In 2019, American Industrial Partners completed the acquisition of Current, powered by GE, marking a significant change in ownership and potentially strategic direction [(Business Wire, 2019-04-02)](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190402005341/en/American-Industrial-Partners-Completes-Acquisition-Current-powered).\n\n- **New Distribution Center**: In 2020, GE Current opened a new distribution center in Atlanta, which likely enhanced its logistics capabilities and customer service in the region [(Dennis Kaiser, 2020-05-07)](https://www.connect.media/ge-current-opens-new-distribution-center-in-atlanta/?utm_source=crunchbase.com&utm_medium=referral).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nCurrent is a prominent player in the commercial lighting industry, with a strong focus on LED technology and strategic partnerships that enhance its market presence. The company's recent office expansion and product innovations, such as the EAP1 Proline Switchable Area Light, position it favorably in a rapidly evolving market. As states continue to phase out fluorescent lighting, Current's offerings are likely to see increased demand, making it an attractive consideration for prospective candidates and investors alike.",

      "# Post ID 179s3h0: Anyone know much about Godot 4's current lighting performance and culling point and spot lights? 100s of lights that \"should be cull\" seems like they are not. with +1 score by [(BlueDiamond87, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/)\nSeems Godot's performance drops pretty hard once there's 100s of punctual lights in a 3D scene using the Forward Plus Renderer.  While Unreal Engine seems to hang in there pretty well.  We're talking 30fps compared to 2 fps.  I did a quick and dirty test because I don't have a lot of time to dive deeper at the moment.  So I'm reaching out to see if others know more about it.\n\nFrom what I can tell, the number of objects, draw calls, animation and polygon count seems to be working out pretty well in G4 from the initial test I've ran and others too.\n\nThis lighting test (and maybe physics from what I've seen from others) didn't do well when pushed to a \"great\" numbers.\n\nAnyone have some insights about performance for a high multitude of lights?  If lighting performance a known issue?  Is there any estimates on which version will have it improved?\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n## Comment ID k59m7pw with +3 score by [(jmarceno, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/k59m7pw/) (in reply to ID 179s3h0):\nI've worked with Unreal for some years before coming to Godot and they work very differently. UE automatically culls things for you, without you needing to do anything. In Godot you need an occluder3d node. In UE lights can be very cheap, in Godot they can become expensive depending on how you have them configured, especially shadows. You will need to configure the max range of the lights too.\n\nAnd there is the lighting method, SDFGI is much more expensive than VoxelGI, when I changed methods in my game, it went from 90fps to 300+ (large closed scene with around a hundred lights, all casting shadows)\n\nAnd all the above may be wrong in your specific case 😬. My main point is that if you are trying to understand performance, you will need to go through the docs and read the best practices. If you just set up a scene as you would do in Unreal, my experience is that your performance will suck. Although it is important to understand that 3d performance is worse than in UE, no matter what.\n\n### Comment ID k59s0gp with +2 score by [(BlueDiamond87, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/k59s0gp/) (in reply to ID k59m7pw):\nThanks for the great reply!  If you haven't come across this post already, you might find it interesting. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/godot/s/Se2dveSoIp\n\nOthers and I have done other test, and Godot's rendering is very satisfactory in a variety of cases. And some of the other scenes I've tested, G4 seemed to perform similar or faster than UE \"out the box\" but UE does have better GI. I tested VoxelGI and SDFGI in those comparisons. Im happy enough with G4s GI solutions though. It's great FSR 2 is now in the engine, something that was a complaint stepping into G4. I believe what you're saying overall though. \n\nWhat you are saying is what I was worried about with the lighting. I really want to check it out on the source code but I have another project (in Flutter) I need to finish in my free time first :( \n\nBesides physics issues, G4 is really shaping up to be a great 3D engine. This is the first test I ran that gave me a problem. \n\nOtherwise, texture and geo streaming will be a nice feature...one day :)\n\n## Comment ID k58fq15 with +1 score by [(No_Cook_2493, Reddit, 2023-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/179s3h0/anyone_know_much_about_godot_4s_current_lighting/k58fq15/) (in reply to ID 179s3h0):\nIn my 2D project I have 100s of lights with shadows going at once with no issue.

I wanted a fantasy/more saturated look, so I have Cathedral Weathers with Pi-Cho, Lux suite and a custom Reshade to boost saturation and add distance blur. Cabbage ENB is very popular right now and looks great. Obsidian+Rudy is nice for a more dramatic/dark fantasy style, and it looks like the setup for Patrician is also in this style.

Since lighting controls how you see everything in the game (because you couldn't see in the pitch-black dark), it affects how every single part of the game looks.\n\nBasically: instead of current lighting techniques like using multiple [diffuse textures](http://wiki.splashdamage.com/index.php/Diffuse_Maps)/[specular maps](http://wiki.splashdamage.com/index.php/Specular_Maps) for each part of every object in the game to represent different conditions, they can just create 1 texture for each part then artificially define properties like a [refractive index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index) to help parameterize a physics model that controls how light and shadow work when rendering frames of an in-game scene that contains that object.  \n\nIn most implementations the physics model basically uses a predictive set of converging functions to determine how light from a specific source will reflect/refract off a given surface with different reflectivity and absorption/diffusion characteristics, which then refracts and reflects off other surfaces at a) different angles, with b) reduced intensity and c) a different wavelength, etc.\n\nIn productivity terms: people creating textures for in-game assets now have to spend less time creating multiple maps for each surface because they can just say \"this panel is steel\" or \"this seat cushion is leather\" with specific reflectivity/diffusion/texture/etc. rather than having to create multiple different copies of them that behave differently under different lighting conditions (such as in space, in atmosphere, indoors, etc.)\n\nIn visual terms: different types of surfaces (such as metal, leather, plastic, glass, etc.) should look more photorealistic and more \"natural\" because the way that light reflects off them and the way shadows are created will be more accurate.\n\n### Comment ID cdodsd1 with +14 score by [(HSAR, Reddit, 2013-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1rl7bq/could_somebody_please_explain_physical_based/cdodsd1/) (in reply to ID cdoc9r3):\nA great explanation here, especially as it's hard to find good documentation on it.\n\nFor the most part, I can't understand how this doesn't result in a huge performance hit since this is doing the job of diffuse, specular and environment mapping all at once (and ambient occlusion/global illumination, to a lesser degree).\n\nCutting-edge, indeed.\n\n#### Comment ID cfdmy4f with +7 score by [(SirDigbyChknCaesar, Reddit, 2014-02-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1rl7bq/could_somebody_please_explain_physical_based/cfdmy4f/) (in reply to ID cdodsd1):\nI think it's just an easier way to perform similar lighting functions that already exist. You're basically baking all the parameters for a material into one texture layer which gives an accuracy down to the texture resolution. It's probably more consistent as well since the same materials will reference the same parameters.\n\n### Comment ID cdodwv5 with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2013-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1rl7bq/could_somebody_please_explain_physical_based/cdodwv5/) (in reply to ID cdoc9r3):\nWhat's the downside?\n\n#### Comment ID cdoe9ke with +10 score by [(iheijoushin, Reddit, 2013-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1rl7bq/could_somebody_please_explain_physical_based/cdoe9ke/) (in reply to ID cdodwv5):\nMy guess, and it is a guess, is that memory is saved not having to store several layers of textures and lighting maps.

This is not an artist's conception anymore, it is a numerical simulation. The light sources start in the calculation by emitting with a specific distribution, and the simulation computes the reflections between surfaces until the solution converges. The most popular technique for this computation is usually referred to as \"radiosity\", or flux transfer, and it does this by dividing all the surfaces into patches that exchange light energy within a closed system. This type of calculation is limited for the most part to simple scenes with diffuse surfaces where the visibility calculation and the solution matrix are manageable.\"\n\n### Comment ID cdocvn2 with +5 score by [(Ortekk, Reddit, 2013-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1rl7bq/could_somebody_please_explain_physical_based/cdocvn2/) (in reply to ID cdoc5q0):\nI take it as if I light up a surface, lets say it's red, it will cast of red light around the area?\n\nAnd depending on how the surface looks it spreads the light as it would in real life?

      "# [The 12 lighting trends we know you'll be seeing everywhere in 2025 by Jennifer Ebert, Zara Stacey, Charlotte Olby, Hebe Hatton on 2023-01-03](https://www.homesandgardens.com/news/lighting-trends-207692)\nIt's no secret that the lighting in your home, both natural and artificial, is super important. We all know that good lighting can make or break a room and should be treated with the same respect as bigger decisions like paint colors or furniture.\n\nThere are so many gorgeous lighting options out there that can add just as much style and drama to your space as a bigger ticket item can. From bold pendants that double as art to creating subtle layers of light, there's some rather exciting lighting ideas on the horizon for 2025.\n\nWe've sat down with interior designers and lighting experts alike to find out what they're backing as the biggest lighting trends for the coming year. Stay tuned as we dive into the key trends reshaping how we'll light our homes in 2025.\n\n12 new lighting trends shaping 2025\n\nWe asked a panel of lighting experts and interior design insiders on what they expect the biggest lighting trends to be in 2025. So read on to discover what is set to brighten our lives next year and beyond...\n\n1. Rattan and organic materials\n\n'Rattan is having its moment right now, a statement pendant one would look beautiful over a dining table,' suggests interior designer Benji Lewis.\n\nWe’re seeing a shift toward softer, more natural tones and textures in 2025. Whether used to create a dramatic focal point or a subtle accent, organic materials are a bright idea for homes this year.\n\n'I’m beginning to see a shift toward softer, layered lighting that enhances the warmth and intimacy of a space,' agrees Lucy Uren, founder & creative director at Rowen & Wren. 'Organic shapes, natural materials, and understated finishes like aged brass are all things I’m beginning to see more and more.'\n\n2. Making a statement\n\nFrom oversized chandeliers to sculptural pendants and unique floor lamps, designers say it is time to size up.\n\n'I see statement lighting having a real moment in 2025,' says interior designer Kathy Kuo. 'I love the way that a really artful piece of statement lighting can add a pop of personality and visual interest to a minimalist space, and it can also be a really effective design element that doesn't need to take up additional square footage in a small space.'\n\nWhether you want to zone a cozy seating area, like above, or simply want to match the scale and size of a room, an oversized pendant or unexpected pop of color can not only efficiently illuminate a space, but can establish a beautiful design statement.\n\n3. Paper lanterns\n\nA trend we've been spotting on Instagram and in some of the coolest interior design projects of late is a love for large, oversized paper lanterns.\n\nCreating a warm and inviting atmosphere, these lightweight fixtures diffuse light beautifully making for a softer alternative to a traditional chandelier or metal fixture. Their organic shapes and delicate textures also add a sense of lightness to a space, which is particularly welcome in smaller or heavily decorated rooms\n\nWhile traditionally associated with minimalist or Japanese-inspired interiors, paper lanterns are finding their place in a variety of design styles, from Scandi to boho and even traditional homes.\n\n4. Vintage Touches\n\nWhether sourced from antique markets or designed with a retro aesthetic in mind, vintage lighting ideas add buckets of personality and uniqueness to a room that something more modern just couldn't muster.\n\n'Trends in lighting design include a more layered approach, in my case distinguished by an infusion of vibrant colors and luxurious materials,' says designer Kati Curtis. 'Our approach to lighting always encompasses a layered scheme, which sidesteps the conventional overhead layout in favor of ambience-enhancing sconces, floor and table lamps.'\n\n'In line with interior design trends in general, there's a growing affinity for collectible floor and table lamps that double as sculptural art pieces, enlivening spaces with their unique artistry and charisma. Brass fixtures are still strong, evoking a blend of timeless elegance and modern sophistication, and we’re using a lot of vintage Murano glass, which always adds a touch of artisanal finesse.' she adds.\n\n5. Unique, bespoke shades\n\n'I’m continually drawn to the use of pattern for adding texture and interest to a room, and lampshades provide the perfect opportunity to experiment – especially for those, like me, that are hesitant to commit to a larger statement piece,' adds Lucy from Rowen & Wren.\n\nWhile going bespoke sounds like a luxury option, simply swapping out shades on standard lamp bases and fixtures can be a surprisingly budget-friendly way to elevate and upgrade an old or even secondhand light.\n\nAs designer Hayley English says, 'We are firm believers in bespoke lampshades as they always provide a softer feel to any space. Custom shades can be applied to overhead lighting, sconces, floor and table lamps!'\n\nAnd the more the better too. 'There's no such thing as too many of these shades in a project because, if created properly, they not only draw on design elements in the space but offer a sophisticated yet lived-in feel.' she adds.\n\n6. Consider adding lighting to joinery\n\nKati Curtis says, a huge lighting trend right now is 'seamlessly integrating lighting into millwork, such as shelves and built-ins, highlights functionality while enhancing the overall aesthetic.'\n\nWhen commissioning bespoke joinery, ask the carpenter to make allowances for internal wiring from the start, this will allow for some lights to be built into the unit, removing the need for trailing wires from standalone lamps or wall lights, resulting in a cleaner finish.\n\nInterior decorator, Sarah Brown, commissioned this pretty bespoke shelving painted in a pale pink gloss with tongue and groove detailing, for a sitting room in London. She says, ‘An interesting room is made up of many layers that allow the eye to travel.'\n\n'Joinery lighting on open shelves looks super, it’s a brilliant way of casting a direction of soft light onto a vase or decorative bowl for example,' adds Benji.\n\n7. Try lampscaping the kitchen\n\nLampscaping is a fairly new term in interiors but one we're really excited about in 2025.\n\nWhile the phrase is a little misleading (you're not just reserved to solely table lamps here), it is simply the idea that lighting should be considered equally as important in the design of a space as choosing a wall color.\n\nThe most important and unexpected lampscaping trend for the coming year is the kitchen countertop lighting trend which encourages you to add a small lamp to a kitchen side or open shelves to introduce a softer, ambient light. It’s a great way to create pockets of cozy light in such an otherwise utilitarian space.\n\n8. Sourcing natural and sustainable materials\n\n'In the pursuit of sustainability and a closer connection to the environment, we anticipate a continued use of natural fabrics in lighting design,' explains Charlie Bowles, Director of Original BTC. 'Materials like linen and cotton not only add tactile appeal but also enhance the diffusion of light, casting a soft and soothing glow.\n\n'The choice of natural fabrics aligns with the broader eco-conscious movement, making it a compelling choice for environmentally-conscious homeowners.'\n\n'And alongside that, as we continue to prioritize wellness and comfort in our homes, lighting that sets a soft, relaxed mood will be key. This involves fixtures designed to create a gentle and calming ambiance. Expect to see more adjustable and dimmable lighting options that allow homeowners to customize the intensity and color temperature of their light sources.' he adds.\n\n9. Embrace timeless, quiet luxury\n\nLess of a trend and more of a style that will last the ages, quiet luxury lighting is an investment that you'll never regret and it will remain stylish and timeless forever.\n\n'The world increasingly feels like a challenging place, so we’re drawn to moments of calm. In our efforts to seek out tranquillity, we try to surround ourselves with beautifully made pieces that evoke a sense of equilibrium and simplicity,' continues Paul.\n\n'The quiet luxury trend is all about considered composure. What these lighting pieces lack in drama, they make up for in detail. Clean lines and simple materials are the starting principles but gain an extra facet of lavishness through thoughtful creative touches. Key to this lighting trend is the beautiful fusion of simplicity and intricacy,' Paul suggests.\n\n10. Sculptural pieces\n\nAs well as looking to make a statement with your lighting – both overhead and on the ground – designers are also predicting more sculptural lights will make their way into our spaces; adding beautiful, artistic touches to a room.\n\nIan Cameron says, 'Sculptural lighting resembling incredibly beautiful and organic shapes from the natural world can add a welcome softness and fluidity to interiors. From the flowing movement of water to the incredible silhouettes of mountain ranges, nature-inspired designs will continue to be a popular trend in our homes.'\n\nWith curvaceous shapes and arch structures set to be popular across architecture and furniture trends, sculptural lighting will work in unison, helping to create relaxed interiors that feel soft, calm and inviting.\n\n11. Layered, mood-enhancing lighting\n\nUsing layered lighting, from cozy table lamps to candle scones and twinkling fairy lights, to establish welcoming pools of light in the home, is renowned for making our spaces feel more relaxing and calm.\n\nFrom the recent TikTok design trends about never using the 'big light', to the importance of our homes being centers for wellness and restoration, Piero de Marchis, director at Detail Lighting, discusses why mood lighting is so important.\n\n'Ambient lighting allows you to set the mood and change the ambiance in a room. A key part of planning a design scheme, homeowners are paying far more attention to the way spaces in the home make us feel, as well as their function. From dim-to-warm technology to discreetly hidden accent and spotlighting, mood-enhancing lighting is set to continue to be a key consideration for 2025 and beyond, in particular in bathrooms, bedrooms, and multifunctional spaces such as open-plan kitchens.'\n\n12. Smart lighting\n\nWith changes in technology and advances in lighting design having an impact on lighting trends year on year, many of us are now kitting out our homes with smart lighting.\n\nPiero de Marchis says, 'Our homes are having to work harder for us than ever before, with an increase in spaces having multiple functions. From open-plan living areas to kitchen-dining zones, the trend for installing multifunctional lighting that can be adapted to suit the room as it’s being used is set to continue to rise.'\n\nFrom voice-activated and motion-sensing lights to multifunctional fittings, as shown on the shelving unit above by John Cullen Lighting, these clever lighting designs are often more energy-efficient and can make the lighting schemes in your space feel more unique as well as incredibly functional.\n\nFAQs\n\nAre pendant lights out of style in 2025?\n\nWhile TikTok has called for the end of the 'big light', pendant lights still remain one of the most versatile and practical lighting options for the home.\n\nIndustville’s managing director, Mara Miller, says 'pendant lighting is an essential part of lighting within your home. This trend can redefine your space by creating focal points and stunning visual impact. By embracing pendant lighting, anyone can achieve their style as various pendant fixtures come in sleek, modern, traditional and industrial finishes.'\n\nChris Pask also supports this and says, 'We are noticing a shift away from spotlights which was very much en vogue several years ago but is becoming less popular, with interior designers taking cues from the world of hospitality and private members clubs, where lighting plays a crucial role in setting the tone of the space. We expect this trend to continue in the residential setting, with a greater shift towards lighting arrangements that are more soothing and aesthetically pleasing rather than harsh, unflattering spotlights.'\n\nAre traditional chandeliers going out of style?\n\nA traditional chandelier will always be timeless and undeniably beautiful, establishing a luxurious atmosphere of grandeur and elegance.\n\nAnd they should not just be reserved for period properties, either. Traditional chandeliers can work wonderfully in more modern settings, creating a unique element of contrast and establishing a stylish mix of the old and the new.\n\nOf course, this classic style of lighting is not for everyone, and many modern chandelier interpretations are proving popular for more contemporary homes; with designs crafted from an array of different materials to form unique shapes and hanging arrangements.\n\nWhether you’re upgrading your current setup or starting fresh, these trends will ensure your home shines brighter than ever in 2025.",
      "# [Active List of U.S. States Banning Fluorescent Lights](https://www.pecnw.com/blog/active-list-of-us-states-banning-fluorescent-lights/)\nAcross the United States, a significant shift towards more sustainable lighting options is underway as an increasing number of states have either enacted or set to officially enact bans on the sale of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and linear fluorescent tubes (T8, T5, T12).\n\nBelow is an active list of U.S. states enacting bans, as well as their respective phase out dates for the sale, offer, or distribution of screw-base, bayonet-base, and pin-base CFLs, as well as linear fluorescent tubes.\n\nCommercial customers in California may also qualify for On-Bill Financing (OBF), depending on their utility provider.\n\nOBF is a fantastic option for eligible projects, allowing customers to make interest payments as low as 0% towards their project on their monthly utility bills.\n\nThe major benefit is that the payments are made with the energy savings captured from the LED upgrade, giving participants a state-of-the-art lighting system that provides long-term energy savings — without needing to allocate any capital.\n\nConnect with our team to discuss if OBF programs are available in your service territory.\n\nAccording to Inside Lighting, the new legislation outlines a comprehensive enforcement mechanism to oversee compliance. The executive director of the state Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) will conduct a verification at least once before January 1, 2026, and again before January 1, 2031, and deliver a report on the method and findings to the Energy and Environment Committee of the House of Representatives and the Transportation and Energy Committee of the Senate. The report will also be posted on the CDPHE’s website within a month after completion.\n\nThe penalties for businesses that fall out of compliance can be substantial:\n\nCivil penalties of up to $500 per violation may be imposed.\n\nEach transaction or online for-sale product listing constitutes a separate violation.\n\nThe maximum penalty for any related series of violations is capped at $500,000.\n\nLegislation source: nysenate.gov\n\nIn June 2023, New York signed and enacted Assembly Bill A10439, enforcing a manufacturing ban on the sale of high CRI (color rendering index), cold temperature, and impact-resistant linear fluorescent lamps that do not meet the current Federal Department of Energy’s efficiency requirements.\n\nAccording to Phillips, any covered lamps manufactured before June 26, 2023, can be sold in the state of New York. Any covered lamps manufactured on or after June 26, 2023, cannot be sold in the state of New York unless they meet the DOE efficiency requirements. A similar manufacturing ban (but only applying to high CRI lamps) began in Oregon on January 1, 2023.\n\nIn July of 2023, the New York Public Service Commission filed an order (Case 18-M-0084) that will eliminate all utility incentive programs for LED lighting upgrades starting in 2026.\n\nCommercial customers of NYSEG and RG&E have the opportunity to capitalize on a Limited Time Year-End Bonus promotion for incentives to be applied towards energy efficiency projects.\n\nEnergy incentives have historically been an extremely valuable resource for LED lighting retrofits, allowing businesses to access funds that often cover substantial portions of the total project cost.\n\nEnergy Trust of Oregon (ETO), one of the top incentive program administrators in the state, has already announced that they will be discontinuing their incentives available for LED Lighting upgrades once bans take effect.\n\nCurrent plans are to keep the incentive for the replacement of pin-base CFL and linear fluorescent tubes in place until July 1, 2025 (or until funds run out)!\n\nAccording to FastDemocracy, the bill was introduced in February 2023 and was signed into law on June 22, 2023.\n\nWhile exact penalties for non-compliance are unclear, the bill states that “Violations of this act would result in civil penalties as enforced by the Department of Environmental Management (DEM).”\n\nSource: dec.vermont.gov\n\nIn November 2023, the state of Vermont enacted a new law that began prohibiting the sales of specific mercury-containing fluorescent lighting bulbs.\n\nIn November 2022, Vermont became the first US state to place bans on the sale or distribution of screw-base CFL bulbs, according to The Hill.\n\nThe legislation introduced in 2023, Act 120, introduced an additional ban specifically on 4-foot fluorescent lamps, bringing the state total bans and effective dates to the following:\n\nScrew-base & bayonet-base CFL: Ban effective February 17, 2023\n\nLinear fluorescent tube (4-foot lamps): Ban effective January 1, 2024\n\nThe first date noted is the sales prohibition start date for new installations. The second date (if noted) is the end of the replacement lamp exemption period. Replacement lamps can only be used in fixtures installed before the bans starts.\n\nThese states are just the beginning, with others expected to announce their own regulations soon.\n\nFluorescent lights, once a common sight in offices and industrial facilities, contain mercury — a toxic heavy metal that is used in CFLs to help them emit light more efficiently.\n\nWhen CFLs break during disposal, that mercury is released into the atmosphere, it is capable of traveling hundreds of miles before depositing into the Earth’s surface. These mercury deposits put both humans and animals at risk of mercury exposure and consumption, which has been shown to cause severe health issues.\n\nThis also creates serious (and costly) waste disposal challenges.\n\nOn top of the mercury concerns, fluorescents are substantially less efficient than LED technology — leading to excessive energy waste.\n\nThis waste creates a lose-lose scenario for both businesses and the environment: the business endures steep energy bills to power a low-performing, high-maintenance lighting system, while the environment endures excessive carbon being released into the atmosphere.\n\nIn terms of maintenance, LED fixtures also offer a significant boost to a fixture’s life expectancy, with high-quality products offering lifespans of 100,000+ hours.\n\nThese factors contribute to the growing consensus that moving away from fluorescent lighting is both an environmental imperative and an economic advantage, leading to the increasing popularity of states instilling sunset timelines for fluorescents.\n\nIncentive & Rebate programs have historically been a significant cost benefit for businesses transitioning to LED — often covering 50%-100% of the total project cost for the LED upgrade, depending on the program and available funds.\n\nThese programs, which are typically offered through utility providers, were put in place to drive greater adoption of energy-efficient technologies (like LED) in an effort to relieve heavy strains being placed on the electrical grid.\n\nHowever, as fluorescent falls out of compliance, several utility providers have already announced plans to discontinue their incentives available for LED once bans take effect.\n\nBusinesses should strongly consider taking advantage of these programs while they are still in place before they expire, as they will be required to make the transition to LED regardless.\n\nRetrofitting existing fixtures to accommodate new technologies, such as LED, can represent a daunting investment — but it can also be a major opportunity if handled with care and long-term consideration. Finding the right LED upgrade for your facility can reduce energy spending by up to 80%, provide payback periods of under 3 years, slash carbon emissions, and dramatically improve the safety and overall environment for employees! Here are some key things to keep in mind to maximize impact on your LED transition:\n\nBeyond the ability to provide more light with less energy, modern LED technology has an improved ability to direct light, leveraging sophisticated optics to distribute light throughout a space in the most energy-efficient manner. Settling for 1:1 fixture replacements may lead to excessive energy consumption, over-lighting your space, and create “hot spots” that lead to visibility challenges for employees.\n\nTubular LED technology can be traced back to the early 2000s at a time when the development of white LEDs made it possible to use LEDs for general lighting. Traditionally designed to be a retrofit replacement for fluorescent tubes in compatible luminaries, LED tubes (TLEDs) were an attractive option offering significant cost and energy savings. When specified and installed correctly, they can reduce electricity consumption by over 50% compared to T8 fluorescent lamp technology.\n\nHowever, understand the safety concerns with TLED bulb swaps.\n\nWe have heard a number of stories from customers who came to us after having bad experiences with TLEDs and substandard LED “solutions” — including severe fires that led to costly production shutdowns.\n\nSee some of the cautionary TLED tales in our blog here »\n\nAs LED has become increasingly more affordable to manufacture, the LED market has become incredibly saturated with new-entrant brands that over-promise and under-deliver. In fact, many manufacturers will offer the same performance criteria on the spec sheet, have a price tag that reflects top-shelf performance, but never have been actually battle-tested in the field — ultimately leading to failures and performance issues down the road.\n\nA big advantage of working with a solution expert like PEC is that we work with clients as a vendor-agnostic service provider. This means that when we design a project, we put together a mix of lumen package options and walk our clients through the pros and cons of each. We help you correlate price and performance, incorporating quality-assured fixture options that we have used in our experience of over +8,000 projects.\n\nLED lighting retrofits make for attractive investments because you can confidently predict your future energy savings and cashflows.\n\nThis is done through an energy audit and photometric analysis. Experienced auditors and lighting designers will record your current lighting technology and light levels through an on-site audit, correlate that audit data with your monthly energy consumption, and determine what your new energy spend will be based on the proposed new system.\n\nThis analysis allows you to accurately forecast your project payback period (often less than 3 years) and your project your future added cash flow from energy and maintenance savings over time.\n\nLearn more about PEC Energy Audits »\n\nYour transition to LED could be a massive, unrealized opportunity for your business. We don’t think about the power improved lighting can have on our business, but we all recognize a nice, motivating space to work when we see it.
