Customer’s rights to use the Products are limited to those expressly set forth in this Agreement, including any license parameters specified in the Order Schedule. DataStax and its licensors retain all rights, title and interest in and to the Products and all related intellectual property rights, including without limitation any modifications, updates, or other add-ons.\n\n1.2 Restrictions.

Customer is responsible and liable for (1) keeping secure all account credentials for the Products issued to (or created by) Customer and Authorized Users, and (2) all Authorized Users' acts and omissions in connection with the Products and compliance with the Agreement. Customer should promptly contact DataStax in writing if Customer believes that the account credentials of Customer or its Authorized Users’ have been compromised or if there has been any unauthorized use of the Products. DataStax reserves the right to reset or terminate any account login credentials if DataStax reasonably believes there has been unauthorized access or activity on a Customer's account. DataStax shall, if applicable, give Customer reasonable prior notice before resetting or terminating login credentials pursuant to this Section, and shall issue new login credentials promptly once any unauthorized use or activity is remedied, so as to avoid disruption to Customer’s and/or Authorized Users’ use of or access to the Products.\n\n1.4 Feedback and Usage Analytics. Customer may provide feedback to DataStax about the Products (e.g. technical support input, suggestions, or enhancement requests) (“Feedback”) and generate usage analytics, including but not limited to aggregated technical data and metadata from the Products (“Usage Analytics”). Subject always to DataStax’s obligations under Section 5 (Confidentiality) DataStax shall have all right, title, and interest in and to such Feedback, and Customer agrees to assign to DataStax all right, title, and interest in and to such Feedback. DataStax may develop, modify, and improve the Products based on Customer’s Feedback and Usage Analytics without any obligation to Customer. In no event may DataStax sell, license or otherwise externally distribute Customer’s Usage Analytics or Customer Confidential Information.\n\n1.5 No-Fee License. DataStax may make certain Products available for trial, proof of concept, preview, beta testing, demo, or other similar purposes. Products provided to Customer for such purposes are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis and without any warranty or indemnity and may be used solely for non-production purposes (“No-Fee License”), without the right to Support. No-Fee License Products may contain bugs, errors, or other defects and Customer uses at its sole risk. DataStax may discontinue or terminate such offerings at any time in its sole discretion without notice. DataStax shall not be liable for any damages arising out of or in connection with a No-Fee License.\n\n1.6 Affiliate Use. Customer's Affiliates may purchase Products from DataStax by executing an Order Schedule that incorporates by reference the terms of this Agreement.\n\n2. Customer Data, Privacy, and Security\n\n2.1 Customer Data. As between DataStax and Customer, all title and intellectual property rights in and to the Customer Data is owned by Customer. In connection with its provision of certain Products and in order to provide Support and exit assistance pursuant to Section 4.6 (“Exit Assistance”), Customer grants DataStax a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license during the Product Term and during any period of Exit Assistance to access, process, copy, archive, or store Customer Data solely for the purpose of (and only to the extent necessary for) providing Products, Support, and Exit Assistance under this Agreement.\n\n2.2 Account Information. DataStax may collect, process and store contact information and related billing information (“Account Information”).

With respect to any Customer Personal Data processed by DataStax, and insofar as DataStax has access to such Customer Personal Data, DataStax shall comply with the Data Processing Agreement. With respect to any Customer Personal Data obtained by DataStax as a controller, DataStax shall comply with the DataStax’s Privacy Notice.\n\n3. Payment\n\n3.1 Fees. Customer will pay all fees (the “Fees”) as specified in the Order Schedule and any applicable Taxes. If the due date is not otherwise specified in the Order Schedule, all Fees are due 30 days from the date of receipt of invoice. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, all Fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable. Unless otherwise specified in the Order Schedule, all Fees are in U.S. dollars. If Customer requires a purchase order to complete its purchase and notifies DataStax prior to the effectiveness of the applicable Order Schedule, then the Products will not be provided until Customer delivers a conforming purchase order unless agreed otherwise in writing.\n\n3.2 Taxes. Customer is responsible for any duties, customs fees, or taxes (other than DataStax’s income tax) associated with the purchase of the Products provided by DataStax, (including any related penalties or interest) (“Taxes”), and shall pay the listed fees without deduction for Taxes. If Customer is required by applicable law to withhold any amount from any payments specified in the Order Schedule, then Customer will pay DataStax the listed fees as if no withholding were required, and shall remit the withholding to the appropriate governmental authorities on behalf of DataStax, with a copy of the tax receipt or certificate forwarded to DataStax.\n\n3.3 Delinquencies. Any late payments of undisputed amounts will accrue late charges at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per annum, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower. If Customer utilizes a credit card to pay for the Product(s) and if a Customer's credit card expires or is canceled or the charge is otherwise denied, DataStax will attempt to reprocess the charges. Customer is responsible for updating its credit card or bank information to ensure payment can be made. Customer shall be responsible for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by DataStax in collecting the unpaid Fees, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees, court costs, and collection agency fees.\n\n3.4 Disputes. If Customer believes that DataStax has incorrectly billed Customer, Customer shall use reasonable endeavors to contact DataStax in writing within 60 days of the date of receipt of invoice (“Dispute Period”) for the charge in dispute, specifying the error. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Customer waives any and all claims relating to the Fees unless Customer has properly notified DataStax of the dispute within the Dispute Period.

If a Suspension Event is due to Customer’s or an Authorized User’s negligence or act of omission, DataStax shall provide Customer with reasonable information in DataStax’s possession so that Customer may investigate the cause of the Suspension Event. DataStax shall reinstate Customer’s access promptly after Customer has remedied the Suspension Event, or demonstrated to DataStax’s reasonable satisfaction (DataStax acting reasonably) that Customer has taken commercially reasonable steps to minimize recurrence of that Suspension Event.\n\n4.4.2. If a Suspension Event is due to Customer’s or an Authorized User’s fraudulent use of the Products, breach of applicable laws or regulations, gross negligence or willful misconduct, DataStax shall have the right to terminate this Agreement (without the ability to cure) and any applicable Order Schedule without any rights of reinstatement.\n\n4.5 Effect of Termination or Expiration.

      "# [Adding and removing data in Astra tables on 2020-06-01](https://www.datastax.com/blog/2020/06/adding-and-removing-data-astra-tables)\nIn the last post, you used the DataStax Astra API to generate data for our Better Botz database. When DataStax Astra was made generally available, GraphQL was added as a feature for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.\n\nGraphQL uses queries and mutations to retrieve and change data.\n\nGoal 1: See the status of current products\n\nBetter Botz has created a new and improved Heavy Lift Arms. While planning when to add Heavy Lift Arms II, Better Botz needs to know if the existing Heavy Lift Arms are already listed.\n\nIf necessary, get a fresh authorization token using the DataStax Astra API. Replace {auth-token} with the value for your database.\n\ncurl --request POST \\\n\n--url https://{databaseid}-{region}.apps.astra.datastax.com/api/rest/v1/auth \\\n\n--header 'accept: */*' \\\n\n--header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n\n--header 'x-cassandra-request-id: {auth-token}'\n\nUsing GraphQL, run a query to see if you already have the Heavy Lift Arms II.\n\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://{databaseid}-{region}.apps.astra.datastax.com/api/graphql' \\\n\n--header 'accept: */*' \\\n\n--header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n\n--header 'x-cassandra-request-id: {unique-UUID}' \\\n\n--header 'X-Cassandra-Token: {auth-token}' \\\n\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n\n--data-raw '{\"query\":\"query {products(value: {id:\\\"Heavy Lift Arms\\\"}) {values {id name price description created}}}\"}'\n\nReplace the following values with the values for your database:\n\nReplace {databaseid} with the UUID of your database, copied from the Astra URL.\n\nReplace {region} with the cloud region where your database is located, as listed on the Database Details page in Astra. For example, us-east1.\n\nEnter a {unique-UUID} for the request and the {auth-token} you created earlier.\n\nCheck for an existing “Heavy Lift Arms II”. This should verify that you do not have an existing “Heavy Lift Arms II” product.\n\nGoal 2: Add a new product\n\nNow that you know there aren’t any Heavy Lift Arms in the products table, you want to add the new and improved product to our table for customers to be able to order.\n\nUse the following cURL command:\n\ncurl --request POST \\\n\n--url https://{databaseid}-{region}.apps.astra.datastax.com/api/rest/v1/keyspaces/{my_keyspace}/tables/{table_name}/rows \\\n\n--header 'accept: application/json' \\\n\n--header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n\n--header 'x-cassandra-request-id: {unique-UUID}' \\\n\n--header 'x-cassandra-token: {auth-token}' \\\n\n--data-raw '{\"query\":\"mutation {superarms: insertProducts(value:{id:\\\"65cad0df-4fc8-42df-90e5-4effcd221ef7\\\"\\n name:\\\"Arm Spec A2\\\" description:\\\"Heavy Lift Arms II\\\"price: \\\"9999.99\\\" created: \\\"2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z\\\"}){value {name description price created}}}\",\"variables\":{}}'\n\nReplace the following values with the values for your database:\n\nReplace {databaseid} with the UUID of your database, copied from the Astra URL.\n\nReplace {region} with the cloud region where your database is located, as listed on the Database Details page in Astra. For example, us-east1.\n\nModify {my_keyspace} to match the name of your keyspace.\n\nReplace table_name with the name of the table you want to create. In this example, enter products as the table name.\n\nEnter a {unique-UUID} for the request and the {auth-token} you created earlier.\n\nThe --data-raw option defines the new product, including a description, price, and created timestamp.\n\nUsing a GraphQL query, confirm the new product is available in the database:\n\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://{databaseid}-{region}.apps.astra.datastax.com/api/graphql' \\\n\n--header 'accept: */*' \\\n\n--header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n\n--header 'x-cassandra-request-id: {unique-UUID}' \\\n\n--header 'X-Cassandra-Token: {auth-token}' \\\n\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n\n--data-raw '{\"query\":\"query {products(value: {id:\\\"Heavy Lift Arms II\\\"}) {values {id name price description created}}}\"}'\n\nReplace the following values with the values for your database:\n\nReplace {databaseid} with the UUID of your database, copied from the Astra URL.\n\nReplace {region} with the cloud region where your database is located, as listed on the Database Details page in Astra. For example, us-east1.\n\nEnter a {unique-UUID} for the request and the {auth-token} you created earlier."

If you compare 5 to Astra, you are looking at the current state-of-the-art thinking around SAI, and the code there is constantly updated and released. I outlined how that process works for all the large contributors to Cassandra and how we upstream changes. [https://www.datastax.com/blog/apache-cassandra-5-0-and-datastax-the-benefits-of-staying-in-sync](https://www.datastax.com/blog/apache-cassandra-5-0-and-datastax-the-benefits-of-staying-in-sync)\n\n  \nIf you are on the project mailing list, you'll see some recent activity from Caleb Rackliffe(Apple) on how he is working to make it even faster. SAI will continue improving over the years, and Cassandra releases will be the home of the most stable version contributors upstream.\n\n### Comment ID ls8bnd3 with +1 score by [(ParticularFickle3154, Reddit, 2024-10-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cassandra/comments/1g52i5p/is_apache_cassandra_and_datastax_cassanras_sai/ls8bnd3/) (in reply to ID ls8acsg):\nThank you!",

DataStax has raised over $80M and has over 300 customers (including over 25 of the Fortune 100), and we were recently named the [top Big Data company by employee satisfaction](http://readwrite.com/2014/04/04/10-big-data-startups-employees-glassdoor).\n\nUnfortunately, we only have about 30 employees in Austin.  Partly this is a consequence of a good thing: we are willing to hire good people anywhere, and I have people on my team in France, Belarus, Scotland, England, and Sweden.  But partly this is because we have lots of people in California after moving the HQ there in 2011, which is kind of a downer.  (I'm still based in Austin.)\n\nWe're hiring here in [both sales and engineering](http://www.datastax.com/company/careers).

Business requirements that entail georeplication often present some of the same challenges even if it would otherwise be \"small data.\"\n\nBig data systems can be broadly categorized as analytical (data warehouses like hadoop) or operational (databases like Cassandra that run large applications).  It's the data warehouse people that are hiring \"data scientists,\" which is basically applied statistics with a willingness to experiment with new technology.\n\n#### Comment ID ch26avz with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2014-04-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/23yp7a/i_started_datastax_in_austin_4_years_ago_this/ch26avz/) (in reply to ID ch25vp9):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID ch1uzp8 with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2014-04-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/23yp7a/i_started_datastax_in_austin_4_years_ago_this/ch1uzp8/) (in reply to ID 23yp7a):\nHello jbellis,\n\nCongratulations on your success. Employee satisfaction earns mad respect in my field.\n\nThat said, I am curious on your thoughts of many global economists right now. Who better to ask than a big data guy, right? What are your thoughts and future forecasts on a US tech bubble? Your firm identifies as a start-up and so it goes without saying that you are part of this bubble.\n\nDoes your firm 1) believe there's a bubble and 2) how is it preparing other than going on a hiring spree?\n\n### Comment ID ch1v8im with +3 score by [(jbellis, Reddit, 2014-04-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/23yp7a/i_started_datastax_in_austin_4_years_ago_this/ch1v8im/) (in reply to ID ch1uzp8):\nI would not be surprised to see a downturn in the near future.  I'm kind of looking forward to it; right now, there's a lot of noise in the market since so many me-too companies have jumped on the Big Data bandwagon.  A downturn would shake out the weaker players, and also make Oracle customers take a hard look at more cost-effective options.\n\n#### Comment ID ch1vi63 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2014-04-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/23yp7a/i_started_datastax_in_austin_4_years_ago_this/ch1vi63/) (in reply to ID ch1v8im):\nThat's actually surprising to hear from you. I agree, there's a lot of noise in the Big Data market but those falling out from the field due to a bubble would likely be those that aren't entrenched already. There are much bigger and much older firms in Austin that can outlive and outlast a lot of the start-up population.\n\nCost-prohibitive DaaS solutions aren't the only thing Oracle has going against them but their market share will make it hard to move them. I agree that they aren't the best solution but they *are* entrenched.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for your time.\n\n### Comment ID ch1z035 with +1 score by [(rubber_band_man_, Reddit, 2014-04-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/23yp7a/i_started_datastax_in_austin_4_years_ago_this/ch1z035/) (in reply to ID ch1uzp8):\nBubble talk is all the rage now in days but overblown imo. \n\nHere are 2 recent and well received links about the 'tech bubble'.

I joined a research group as a undergrad assistant. No one in the group really knows much about Cassandra, including me, so they tasked me to dig a bit deeper. We currently use mongoDB.\n\nSpecifically, they want me to get a general idea of cassandra (pro/con, why we should or shouldn't use it based on what we currently have) and also play around with basic functions (figuring out installation, data input/output, how it works with python, etc.)\n\nBefore coming to this lab, I didn't know much about database and systems. However, I thought I would be able to find some tutorial/books and get a grasp.\n\n1) So my first question is, can anyone recommend a beginner friendly (emphasis on beginner) course/book/tutorial that I can learn from that literally starts from step 0? \n\nThis is really important to me because my first task was to simply install Cassandra and it was way more frustrating than I thought it would be. I couldn't find a comprehensive tutorial and had to piece together different bits of info from various webpages or videos.\n\nSo now, I've finally able to start a cassandra server through cmd (cassandra -f), use python CQL shell, and downloaded the cassandra driver for python. It was frustrating trying to figure this all out without a solid guide so that's why I'm asking for recommendations of good source to pick up from from this point on.\n\n\n2) what does it actually mean to install cassandra? In other words, I'm not sure I'm doing everything correctly. I just started reading tutorials and troubleshooting until I stopped seeing so many error messages. So now that I got the cqlsh, a server, and python drivers running, what else do I need to do? Kind of lost there\n\n3) To be specific, when I mean python driver, I mean the datastax python driver that I installed using pip. So what exactly is the python driver and the CQL shell? Are these means to communicate data to casssandra? and if so, then what is cassandra? Is it a database, language, etc?\n\n4)I've read that the data in cassandra spans many machines and devices.

Because unless you have very specific use cases where a relational database does not fit, you should just go for a relational database. Since you're currently using MongoDB which isn't really good at anything I would strongly urge you to try to figure out what problem you're solving first. \n\n> So my first question is, can anyone recommend a beginner friendly (emphasis on beginner) course/book/tutorial that I can learn from that literally starts from step 0?\n\nThere isn't really \"beginner friendly\" material. But what cassandra basically is, is a distributed hash-map. You retrieve and store stuff by key. If your access patterns don't fit that you probably should not use it.\n\nOther than that; read the [Datastax documentation](http://docs.datastax.com/en/landing_page/doc/landing_page/current.html). \n\n> what does it actually mean to install cassandra? \n\nCassandra, like most databases, is just an application. So it needs to be running somewhere for your application to be able to access it. So that's what you're doing. \n\n> To be specific, when I mean python driver, I mean the datastax python driver that I installed using pip. So what exactly is the python driver and the CQL shell? Are these means to communicate data to casssandra? and if so, then what is cassandra? Is it a database, language, etc?\n\nYou really really should not be using Cassandra. Start with a normal relational database like Postgres or MySQL. You're a complete beginner.\n\nLike I said; Cassandra, like most databases, is just an application that runs somewhere that manages your data. Typically you connect through TCP/IP to it. The python driver makes that bit easier for you when you use Python to access your database. CQLSH is just a command line tool that also connects to your database and lets you query the database.\n\n> I've read that the data in cassandra spans many machines and devices. But how do I make it more permanent and widespread than just my laptop right now? \n\nSetting up a Cassandra cluster is complex. How to do it is all in the documentation. But like I said; you guys should not even be using it so I'm not going to even try to explain stuff like how Cassandra nodes operate in a ring and how partitions matter if you don't know the database basics yet, sorry.\n\nAgain: start with SQL and a normal relational database for now. It is a LOT more flexible than Cassandra is. \n\nSorry for being a bit blunt but I am just trying to help you avoid using NoSQL if you don't actually have a need for it.\n\n### Comment ID dqhtaa5 with +1 score by [(BLlMBLAMTHEALlEN, Reddit, 2017-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7fkmvq/how_can_i_continue_to_learn_and_code_with/dqhtaa5/) (in reply to ID dqcpyok):\nThanks for the very thorough reply. It seems you really emphasize the complexity of Cassandra. In all honesty, I joined the research group quite recently and just went with what they initially told me. I thought since they've been doing this for a while, they probably have their reasons for using MongoDB.\n\nI'm guessing I need to understand the *why* better. I'll be meeting with the group again soon so what questions/discussion points should I bring up that are really relevant to the normal database vs non-relation argument? I just wanna get a better grasp of the whole thing.\n\n#### Comment ID dqhvomy with +1 score by [(nutrecht, Reddit, 2017-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7fkmvq/how_can_i_continue_to_learn_and_code_with/dqhvomy/) (in reply to ID dqhtaa5):\nA large part of our work is figuring out what kind of tool we need to use to solve a particular problem. In general if you don't have specific requirements for specialised NoSQL stores (as evident by their use of Mongo; it's pure marketing that doesn't really have any strengths) you should go for a relational store. You can model pretty much anything you can think of, both in storage and in how you want to query the data, in a relational database. \n\nSo definitely; bring this up and try to get an answer to the 'why'. Feel free to poke me if you have more questions. And be ready for people, especially rather junior devs, being rather defensive of their choices.\n\n## Comment ID dqcorc3 with +1 score by [(ordnance1987, Reddit, 2017-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7fkmvq/how_can_i_continue_to_learn_and_code_with/dqcorc3/) (in reply to ID 7fkmvq):\nDid you read the [Getting Started](http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/getting_started/index.html) section in the documentation?\n\n## Comment ID dqcp5ao with +1 score by [(notbrandonzink, Reddit, 2017-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7fkmvq/how_can_i_continue_to_learn_and_code_with/dqcp5ao/) (in reply to ID 7fkmvq):\nI just recently did a project in a library the implemented Cassandra using C using a command line interface.

Primary differentiator for Astra is it is much more than just a Vector database.  Astra is a real-time data and AI platform that is able to handle mixed workloads that include vector, non-vector, and streaming data. For example, it's designed for scenarios where real-time updates to the dataset happen simultaneously with queries, ensuring ultra-low latency and highly relevant vector results.\n\nThis is unlike standalone vector databases, which are designed for simple operations and batch workloads. Astra excels in handling production data that's constantly updating in real time. It leverages Cassandra’s Storage Attached Indexing (SAI) technology, on top of which the vector indexes have been built, providing unparalleled I/O throughput for vector search.\n\nEven with that differentiation, Astra doesn't shortcut on what you expect from a great vector database. It integrates seamlessly with various Large Language Model (LLM) frameworks, making it an ideal choice for developing LLM-powered applications. It also supports querying vector data with a supplied Python library or even with the Cassandra Query Language (CQL) or one of the many other APIs built on Stargate to offer freedom of language choice to developers.\n\nLastly, Astra is a powerful, scalable and highly available database being built on Apache Cassandra. It's designed and proven to power enterprise, production  applications and allows you to bring AI and Vectors to the data and not the other way around.\n\n## Comment ID k414hy3 with +1 score by [(ddematheu, Reddit, 2023-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/170jigz/my_strategy_for_picking_a_vector_database_a/k414hy3/) (in reply to ID 170jigz):\nVery cool comparison.

I'm sorry you found something in my talk interesting but then hit a brick wall. I've been working on Cassandra for 12 years now and when I started, I was energized solving the hard problems that everyone was having then. Scaling up data, having it distributed everywhere and staying available through some terrible conditions. I think our community solved that problem and has built one of the most reliable DBs you can use today. I will admit, usability took a back seat and we've been playing catch up for a while. Astra is like alien technology if you came from that world. Now my mission is to help developers with the most important thing. How fast you can put an app into production. It's clear we we have more work to do, but that is work getting done and why your honest feedback is critical and appreciated in our community. (If you want to see that in action, check out the Cassandra mailing list! A lot of unfiltered happening there)\n\nI know you have been talking to David who drives the Astra developer experience and has already been working on many things you outlined. For anyone reading this later, those changes are in how you load data and how you connect to the database. All of those experiences will changing and as of me writing this, many are available in a beta. I'm going to especially call out the secure connect bundle(SCB). It made a lot of sense if you were a bank and accustomed to using Cassandra in a secure environment. Everybody else? 🤷‍♂️ That's going away. \n\nI would love for you to check out our updates and ask for your feedback, but it's your time and I can understand if you have moved on.

Essentially, semantically-relevant documents are retrieved via vector similarity and then injected into an LLM prompt (in-context learning). You can basically talk to your own documents without fine tuning models. See here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/jumpstart-foundation-models-customize-rag.html\n\nThis is exactly what many businesses want. Frameworks for RAG do exist on both Azure and AWS (+open source) but anecdotally the adoption doesn’t seem that mature. Hardly anyone seems to know about it.\n\nWhat am I missing? Will RAG soon become commonplace and I’m just a bit ahead of the curve? Or are there practical considerations that I’m overlooking? What’s the catch?\n\n## Comment ID jzdfp9m with +18 score by [(fabkosta, Reddit, 2023-09-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/16bja0s/why_is_retrieval_augmented_generation_rag_not/jzdfp9m/) (in reply to ID 16bja0s):\nThere are several downsides to RAG.\n\n1. You need a (typically paid) service such as Azure OpenAI to create embedding vectors. This can become expensive for large numbers of documents.\n2. In comparison to traditional text search engines there is no measure of correctness how many documents to retrieve per query.\n3. Furthermore, if you want to guarantee to find the n nearest neighbours of vectors in a vector space that contains many vectors you'll end up sequentially scanning through all vectors for each query. That's very inefficient.

Quantitative questions are also difficult because quantitative data is often structured. RAG is best for unstructured text since anything uploaded will ultimately be converted to markdown (not great for spreadsheets).   \n\n\nMost companies could benefit from RAG, but there is no solution that can be properly tailored for every business. Because of this, we will see two types of companies born. The first is the retrieval companies that have an API. They focus on high-performance RAG and allow developers to build unique products that solve problems for specific subindustries. From there, we'll see a boom of companies that hone in on a specific use case of RAG, and use the RAG APIs to construct their platforms.   \n\n\nThere are already a bunch of legal-specific firms trying this, but their internal (standard) RAG solutions aren't cutting it. That will improve as they discover RAG providers.   \n\n\nHealthcare will be a fantastic use case, as long as HIPAA compliance is met. Imagine having knowledge bases of patient-specific information that can be accessed by both the patient and the healthcare provider (doctor), and having that data accessible via natural language (simple conversation).   \n\n\nFinance is tricky, but regulations within the financial space will work great with RAG. This falls under the legal use case, but a fin-reg platform would be pretty useful (especially for fintech since fintech startups don't have the capital to cover fintech legal fees).   \n\n\nCustomer service is a no-brainer for RAG, but companies will want to use high-quality RAG (and good foundational models) to make sure they impress their users, rather than offering a neat toy that responds quickly with half-assed information. If companies redirect resources toward high-quality tech and downsize their allocation to human agents, I think we'll all get to enjoy better customer service.\n\n## Comment ID jze2xvy with +2 score by [(Error_Tasty, Reddit, 2023-09-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/16bja0s/why_is_retrieval_augmented_generation_rag_not/jze2xvy/) (in reply to ID 16bja0s):\nYes it will be everywhere soon since it is almost never cost effective to continuously train or fine tune foundationals.\n\n## Comment ID jzep8ph with +2 score by [(MisterMindful, Reddit, 2023-09-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/16bja0s/why_is_retrieval_augmented_generation_rag_not/jzep8ph/) (in reply to ID 16bja0s):\nIf I am recalling correctly the recent releases of elastic search now support RAG so I would say we’re on the horizon of seeing this more commonly implemented as the ecosystem supports it.\n\n## Comment ID k3bevey with +2 score by [(Mammoth-Doughnut-160, Reddit, 2023-10-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/16bja0s/why_is_retrieval_augmented_generation_rag_not/k3bevey/) (in reply to ID 16bja0s):\nRAG does not need paid service to create embedding vectors.

If you need open source, you could run Cassandra 5.x which includes the vector search capabilites.   You can also easily switch between Cassandra for OSS and Astra (for paid managed service) depending on your needs.\n\nThe datastax managed service is not free, and includes a broader set of APIs and drivers than the OSS database version which might help with some of what you were asking (getting away from writing query language code).  When using Cassandra you'll have to write queries in CQL (very similar to SQL).\n\nThe langchain/llama index adapters for PGVector or Astra, make things simpler and force your tables into a certain structure that works with those frameworks, however you can also access the tables directly, if you want.  You just need to be careful to not alter the table structure from what llama index or langchain expects, because then things will start to break.\n\nDepending on the size of your data and query performance needs, you can often get better performance by remodeling the data in a way the DB prefers over how something like the langchain integration works.\n\n## Comment ID kk4xn5z with +1 score by [(NefariousnessSad2208, Reddit, 2024-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1adf3o6/looking_for_a_production_level_vector_db/kk4xn5z/) (in reply to ID 1adf3o6):\nCheck qdrant.."

Everyone was authentic and honest about their challenges at the company and what they really loved. The same theme kept re-appearing, which was that everyone really enjoyed working with the people that DataStax hired.\n\nThis was enough to draw me away from my former employer (who is a partner of DataStax) as they, by contrast, hire for competence only without doing a deep dive on the personality traits of their candidates. The People Team here at DataStax have it down to a science, and as a result- I really do like everyone that I work with directly and indirectly, which makes it easy to stay on-mission.",

Working here you will be exposed to every sort of underhanded, toxic management technique. You will make no money due to predatory comp plans. You will not build lasting customer relationships due to inept sales management constantly trying to save the quarter on the backs of a lonely 1-2 deals a quarter. The stock options are worthless here and there is no option to liquidate anything that you’ve vested. I really cannot stress enough that you can find something far far better for your mental well-being and career progression than a job at DataStax.

No real mystery. If I have a question I ask and I get an answer.\n* No sugar coating. Things are said as they are. I prefer that type of communication personally. Part of being part of a growing company with great products . Sometimes we employees also have to be patient with our Managers and listen to them.\n* I came to DataStax with a lot of experience/ Skills and Knowledge and I learn something on a regular basis. I find that pretty exhilarating. \n* Wellness Program perks. \n* Other perks when you are productive and contribute. \n* I work with happy people and I love what I do.

Does he think professional technologists are just here for the excitement of his weekly ruminations? We are here to make money just like him. When you look at his net worth you know that statement is questionable. It means, \"We won't go public so don't hold your breath\". The loss of key employees who are known in the Cassandra world is concerning. The continuous shift of strategy adds to the confusion. And the snarky comments flung out by the CEO to the staff is uncomfortable, to say the least. I should have paid attention to my instincts as I watched the slow-motion clip of the CEO in the Zoom Sales Kickoff sipping from a bourbon glass. I was expecting to see Ron Burgundy walk in and toast him. I ignored the other disturbing reviews along with this cheesy video. Always trust your instincts.",

      "# [DataStax Acquires Langflow to Accelerate Making AI Awesome by Carter Rabasa on 2024-04-04](https://www.datastax.com/blog/datastax-acquires-langflow-to-accelerate-generative-ai-app-development)\nWe're excited to announce DataStax's acquisition of Langflow. You can read more about the details in our press release and Langflow's announcement on their blog.\n\nAI has completely changed what is possible with software. From ChatGPT to GitHub Copilot, we’re experiencing a shift in how developers build software, and how people use it. We're moving away from a world of drop-downs and radio buttons and hurtling toward a world of conversational interfaces and intelligent apps.\n\nThis has happened before. Consider the shift to cloud, and the shift to mobile before it. One thing that both of those transitions had in common was the rapid improvement in the accessibility of developer tooling and the subsequent explosion in the number of people able to create and build new things. There are more than 26 million developers in the world today largely because technologies like the web and JavaScript have lowered the barriers to entry to build software.\n\nBut AI has completely changed how apps are built. There is a new programming stack for AI being created on the foundations of large language models (LLMs), vector databases, and frameworks like LangChain. The learning curve is steep and developers spend too much time on tasks that can’t directly relate to what they care about: building apps and experiences that people love.\n\nLangflow is the solution. Langflow is a new way of building AI apps built on top of LangChain that integrates with the full breadth of the new AI programming stack. Its interface enables rapid experimentation, testing, and iteration, and its ease of use has opened up AI to a whole new class of developers who have made Langflow one of the fastest growing communities in open source.\n\nDataStax and Langflow: Building a better AI stack\n\nInstead of talking about Langflow, let's dive into a hands-on example of how developers can build a fully functional RAG application in five minutes or less. House of the Dragon is coming back to HBO for season 2 on June 16 (I'm kind of a fan), so let's use the HOTD Wikipedia page as an example of building an AI-powered app using Langflow and DataStax Astra DB.\n\nSo what's happening here? Langflow enables us to create something called a “flow.” These flows are composed of components, and in this example we use four of them: URL, OpenAI Embeddings, Recursive Character Text Splitter, and Astra DB. Here's how the data flows in our example:\n\nThe URL component fetches the webpage text\n\nThis text is passed to our Recursive Text Splitter, which breaks the text into chunks\n\nThese chunks are passed to the Astra DB component\n\nEach chunk is passed to OpenAI to compute the embedding\n\nThe source text and the embedding vector are then stored in Astra DB\n\nUnder the hood, each of these components is built on top of LangChain primitives. The URL component is just a LangChain WebBaseLoader:\n\nIf this feels like a visual way of building AI applications with LangChain, you're right! The insight of LangChain that made them the de facto framework for building AI applications was that developers needed a new set of composable, chainable programming primitives to work with when interacting with LLMs. Langflow makes it easier than ever to build on LangChain and tap effortlessly into the new AI stack.\n\nBut the fun doesn't stop there! Let's head back over to Castle Dragonstone and breath some fire into this example by building a fully functional RAG application that can answer our burning trivia questions about House of the Dragons:\n\nYes, that's right. We've got a fully functional RAG application built on top of customizable Langflow components, all underpinned by the power of LangChain. It took under a minute to set up and you can swap components in and out effortlessly, modify your prompts, and dial in your chunking strategy as you debug and fine-tune your AI application. Langflow makes it 100x easier to get started, iterate, and get your app to production.\n\nLangflow, powered by open source and powered by community\n\nLangflow co-founders Rodrigo Nader and Gabriel Almeida had a vision for an easier and more powerful way for developers to build AI applications. From the beginning, Langflow has been completely open source and its marketplace of tools and integrations has been open to anyone and everyone. This commitment to being easy to use and completely open has fueled one of the fastest growing developer communities in the world.\n\nAnd while change is a constant in our industry, some things will not change: Langflow will continue to be open source, will continue to operate an open and neutral marketplace of integrations, and will continue to be powered by its amazing community of contributors and users. We're excited to work with them to make all developers AI developers, and we can't wait to see what amazing things you’ll build with it.\n\nHere are some resources to help you get started:",

      "# [IBM acquires DataStax to boost watsonx’s generative AI capabilities by Anirban Ghoshal, Anirban Ghoshal Senior on 2025-02-25](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3832704/ibm-acquires-datastax-to-boost-watsonxs-generative-ai-capabilities.html)\nIBM has announced its intent to acquire database and related services provider DataStax for an undisclosed sum in an effort to boost watsonx’s generative AI capabilities.\n\n“DataStax’s technology will enhance IBM’s watsonx portfolio of products accelerating the use of generative AI, helping companies unlock value from vast amounts of unstructured data,” the company said in a statement, adding that the acquisition also builds on IBM’s commitment to open source AI offerings.\n\nIBM’s commitment to open-source AI includes the open-source IBM Granite foundation models and Instruct Lab, which the company describes as a new approach to advancing open-source innovation around large language models (LLMs).\n\nSanta Clara-based DataStax currently offers Apache Cassandra-powered AstraDB NoSQL database-as-a-service, Astra Streaming, and Langflow, an a open-source, web-based, no-code, graphical user interface (GUI) that allows developers to visually prototype LangChain flows and iterate them to develop applications faster.\n\nBig Blue believes that AstraDB’s vector database will help its customer enterprise unlock insights from unstructured data. Vector search, or vectorization, especially in the wake of generative AI proliferation, is seen as a key capability by database vendors as it can reduce the time required to train AI models by cutting down the need to structure data—a practice prevalent with current search technologies. In contrast, vector searches can read the required or necessary property attribute of a data point that is being queried.\n\nAs for Langflow, IBM believes that the tool will help facilitate collaboration across diverse skill sets inside customer enterprises. DataStax acquired Langflow with Logspace, creator of the open source package, for an undisclosed sum in April of last year, with the aim of helping developers accelerate generative AI-based application development.\n\nThe database services provider said at the time that Langflow integrates with its RAGStack, an offering released in November last year to simplify the implementation of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications built with LangChain.\n\nSeparately, IBM pointed out that it will continue to support and engage with the open source Apache Cassandra, Langflow, and Apache Pulsar communities as DataStax has done.\n\nDataStax is IBM’s second acquisition this year. In January, IBM announced its intent to acquire Applications Software Technology LLC, a global Oracle consultancy. The company has been on an acquisition spree since CEO Arvind Krishna took charge in April 2020. Last year, Big Blue was involved in a flurry of acquisitions, including HashiCorp, Prescinto, Kubecost, Accelalpha, SiXworks, Skyarch Networks, Pliant, and Advanced.\n\nIn 2023, IBM acquired Indonesia-based ERP specialist and cloud consulting services provider Equine Global in a bid to boost its consulting business in the Asia Pacific region. In the same month, the company acquired Manta Software, a data lineage platform, to complement its capabilities within watsonx.ai.\n\nPrior to that, IBM had acquired software provider Apptio for $4.6 billion to help enterprises optimize their IT expenditure, particularly cloud costs. The year 2023 also saw Big Blue acquire SaaS-based PrestoDB provider Ahana in April.",
      "# [Sequential Tasks Agent by DataStax](https://docs.datastax.com/en/langflow/examples/sequential-tasks-agent.html)\nBuild a Sequential Tasks Agent flow for a multi-agent application using multiple Agent components.\n\nEach agent has an LLM model and a unique set of tools at its disposal, with Prompt components connected to the Agent Instructions fields to control the agent’s behavior. For example, the Researcher Agent has a Tavily AI Search component connected as a tool. The Prompt instructs the agent how to answer your query, format the response, and pass the query and research results on to the next agent in the flow.\n\nEach successive agent in the flow builds on the work of the previous agent, creating a chain of reasoning for solving complex problems.\n\nThis opens a starter template with the necessary components to run the flow.\n\nThe Sequential Tasks Agent flow consists of these components:\n\nTo create your own multi-agent flow, see Create a problem-solving agent.",
      "# [IBM to Enhance Watsonx Portfolio Through DataStax Acquisition by About the Author, John K. Waters on 2025-02-28](https://campustechnology.com/Articles/2025/02/28/IBM-to-Enhance-Watsonx-Portfolio-Through-DataStax-Acquisition.aspx?admgarea=news)\nIBM has announced it will acquire AI and data solutions provider DataStax, in a move aimed at enhancing its watsonx portfolio and advancing generative artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities for enterprises. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nThe acquisition will integrate DataStax's vector database and AI-driven data management capabilities into IBM's expanding AI ecosystem, addressing the challenge enterprises face in unlocking value from vast amounts of unstructured data.\n\n\"Businesses cannot realize the full potential of generative AI without the right infrastructure — open source tools and technologies that empower developers, harness unstructured data, and provide a strong foundation for AI applications,\" said Dinesh Nirmal, senior vice president of IBM Software, in a statement. \"DataStax possesses deep competency in this area and shares IBM's relentless commitment to simplifying and scaling generative AI for the enterprise.\"\n\nDataStax is known for AstraDB and DataStax Enterprise, its NoSQL and vector database solutions built on Apache Cassandra, as well as Langflow, an open source tool for low-code AI application development. IBM said it plans to continue supporting and developing Apache Cassandra, Langflow, and other open source initiatives such as Apache Pulsar and OpenSearch, reinforcing its commitment to open AI ecosystems.\n\n\"I've had the awesome privilege to be part of the DataStax journey for the last five-plus years and I couldn't be more excited for our next chapter,\" said Chet Kapoor, chairman and CEO at DataStax, in a post on LinkedIn. \"We have long said that there is no AI without data, and this vision will now be amplified with IBM.\"\n\nWith AI adoption increasing across industries, IBM's acquisition of DataStax aims to bridge a critical gap in enterprise AI deployment. The industry analysts at McKinsey estimate that only 1% of enterprise data is currently utilized in AI models, while 70% of companies with high-performing AI initiatives still face data-related challenges. DataStax's technology is expected to enhance IBM watsonx.data, IBM's hybrid data lakehouse for AI and analytics, by enabling enterprises to manage and leverage unstructured data more effectively.\n\nDataStax's solutions are used by major corporations, including FedEx, Capital One, The Home Depot, and Verizon.

Our combined technology will capture richer, more nuanced representations of knowledge, ultimately leading to more efficient and accurate outcomes,” Gunnar said.\n\n“We have long said that there is no AI without data, and this vision will now be propelled as DataStax joins IBM,” DataStax CEO Chet Kapoor said in his own blog post about the acquisition deal. “With our technologies and IBM’s Watsonx.data, their hybrid, open data lakehouse, we will be able to bring vector and AI search to the entire data estate and make IBM’s capabilities available to every developer.”\n\nIn addition to its database, DataStax’s product portfolio also includes Astra Streaming for building real-time data pipelines, the DataStax AI Platform for building and deploying AI applications, and an enterprise AI platform that incorporates Nvidia AI technology.\n\n“By harnessing DataStax's expertise in managing large-scale, unstructured data and combining it with Watsonx's innovative data AI solutions, we will provide enterprise ready data for AI with better data performance, search relevancy, and overall operational efficiency,” Gunnar said.\n\nAnother key attraction for IBM is DataStax’s Langflow open-source, low-code tools for developing AI applications that use retrieval augmented generation (RAG). DataStax acquired those tools in April 2024 when it bought Langflow, the company.\n\n“Langflow empowers developers to rapidly prototype, build, and deploy RAG and multi-agent AI applications with simplicity,” Gunnar wrote. “By providing a low-code interface, it simplifies the complex integration of generative AI models, data processing, and AI workflows, enabling developers to focus on creating intelligent generative AI applications rather than managing technical integrations and complexity associated with building AI applications.”\n\nIBM did not disclose financial details of the planned acquisition, which is expected to be completed sometime in the second quarter of this year, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.\n\nDataStax, founded in 2010 and headquartered in Santa Clara, Calif., is privately held. The company raised $115 million in a private equity funding round led by Goldman Sachs in June 2022. Altogether the company raised $342.6 million, according to the Crunchbase website.",
      "# [IBM to buy open source data platform and AI vendor DataStax by Shaun Sutner, Adrian Bridgwater, Antony Adshead on 2025-02-25](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/news/366619511/IBM-to-buy-open-source-data-platform-and-AI-vendor-DataStax)\nOpen source strategy\n\nWhile the Watsonx line is not fully open source, it provides users with access to open source models. Some of IBM's Granite large language models (LLMs) are open source.\n\nFor its part, DataStax has long played an active role in the open source database community. Its Astra DB and DataStax Enterprise databases and NoSQL and vector database capabilities are based on Apache Cassandra and, except DataStax Enterprise, Langflow, the open source tool and community for low-code AI application development.\n\nAmong DataStax's key capabilities are built-in and easy-to-use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) features for retrieving and generating data for LLMs.\n\n\"IBM has supported the open source Langflow tool for a while. But with the combination of the DataStax hybrid vector database and ... RAG capabilities, IBM is hoping to gear enterprise RAG adoption more easily,\" said Andy Thurai, an analyst at Constellation Research. \"While this solidifies IBM's position in the open source AI space, it will be interesting to see how they will license DataStax going forward to fit with their open source model.\"\n\nThe acquisition will strengthen IBM's efforts to scale generative AI applications for enterprise data, according to the vendor. DataStax's vector database excels at harnessing unstructured enterprise data. And Langflow supplies a graphical, low-code design environment and component orchestration for generative AI applications, IBM said.\n\nIBM said it will continue to support the Apache Cassandra, Langflow, Apache Pulsar and OpenSearch communities, in which DataStax is involved.\n\nData-driven\n\nDoug Henschen, another Constellation Research analyst, noted that DataStax provides the data underpinning for online giants such as Netflix, Overstock, Priceline and Intuit, among others.\n\nWhile IBM's announcement of the planned purchase of DataStax mostly emphasized generative AI opportunities because of DataStax's introduction last year of vector storage and embedding capabilities, DataStax's \"underlying platform is solid and geared to massive, global-scale deployments,\" Henschen said.\n\nHowever, Henschen noted that DataStax has faced increasing competition in recent years, mostly from the big cloud providers -- particularly AWS, with its DynamoDB scalable NoSQL database and Amazon Keyspaces for Apache Cassandra.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see whether big, cloud-native companies with skilled engineering teams turn to self-managing Cassandra in the wake of this acquisition,\" Henschen said.\n\nDataStax started calling itself a \"real-time AI company\" in 2023, after it acquired machine learning vendor Kaskada.\n\nBuilding enterprise AI applications requires a faster and more intelligent way for enterprises to train LLMs with RAG, Thurai said.\n\nDataStax's technology \"will help IBM solve vectorizing and retrieving data as RAG to feed LLMs with large-scale unstructured data,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Subbu Iyer, CEO of longtime DataStax competitor Aerospike, said IBM's planned acquisition highlights the critical importance of data in the age of generative AI. Aerospike, a vendor of a NoSQL database, raised $109 million in a funding round last year.\n\n\"It's clear that data drives the AI revolution. For AI to realize its potential, organizations need massive amounts of real-time data to provide timely, accurate and meaningful results,\" Iyer said.\n\nShaun Sutner is senior news director for Informa TechTarget's information management team, driving coverage of artificial intelligence, unified communications, analytics and data management technologies.

According to reports the global generative AI market size was valued at $43.87 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to $967.65 billion by 2032.\n\nHowever, despite the interest and demand IBM believes businesses are not realizing the full potential of Generative AI. That’s because, according to IBM, they don’t have the right infrastructure, open-source tools and technologies that allow them to create AI applications. “Enterprises want to deliver production AI fast, but are still struggling to unlock the value in their data,” said Chet Kapoor, Chairman and CEO of DataStax. “There is no AI without data.”\n\nOpen Source Commitment\n\nIBM said the deal also built on its commitment to open-source AI. That’s because DataStax is the creator of AstraDB and DataStax Enterprise, NoSQL and vector database capabilities powered by Apache Cassandra; and Langflow, the open-source tool and community for low-code AI application development.\n\nFinancial details of the deal were not disclosed.

DataStax’s technology strengthens IBM’s watsonx portfolio and accelerates the use of generative AI.\n\nThe acquisition fits into IBM’s open-source portfolio. DataStax is the developer of AstraDB and DataStax Enterprise, NoSQL and vector database solutions based on Apache Cassandra, and Langflow. That is an open-source tool and community for low-code AI application development.\n\nIBM continues to support and engage the open-source communities around Apache Cassandra, Langflow, Apache Pulsar and OpenSearch for innovations. IBM’s commitment to open-source AI also includes the IBM Granite foundation models and Instruct Lab, an innovative approach to open-source innovation on Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nLeveraging untapped unstructured data\n\nCompanies struggle with effectively leveraging unstructured data, essential for generative AI. Without the right tools to process and manage this data properly, costly AI projects do not reach their full potential. According to McKinsey, even 70% of companies with successful generative AI initiatives experience data-related challenges. Moreover, researchers estimate companies only leverage 1% of their data in AI models.\n\nIBM helps organizations adopt generative AI at scale and transform their business operations with enterprise data. The acquisition of DataStax strengthens these efforts. For example, DataStax’s vector database makes it easier to leverage unstructured data and accelerates value creation. Langflow provides a visual, low-code design tool and component orchestration for generative AI apps, facilitating collaboration among diverse teams.\n\nProduct-ready GenAI applications.\n\nAstraDB and DataStax Enterprise provide NoSQL and vector database capabilities based on Apache Cassandra. This enables production-ready generative AI applications. AstraDB extends the existing vector functionality of IBM watsonx.data – IBM’s hybrid, open data lakehouse for AI and analytics. Many organisations already use Apache Cassandra, including big names in the software, retail, financial and e-commerce sectors. Apache Cassandra is increasingly used for AI workloads thanks to its scalability, availability, fault tolerance and support for hybrid cloud environments.\n\nIn this context, DataStax combines a database solution with vector and graphRAG functionalities to maximize the use of unstructured data for generative AI.\n\nLangflow, a low-code open-source app builder for RAG and multi-agent AI applications, is Python-based and compatible with various models, APIs and databases. Langflow will add additional middleware functionality to IBM watsonx.ai, IBM’s integrated AI development studio for generative AI applications.",
      "# [IBM to Buy DataStax for Database, GenAI Capabilities by Alex Woodie on 2025-02-25](https://www.bigdatawire.com/2025/02/25/ibm-to-buy-datastax-for-database-genai-capabilities/)\nIBM today announced its intent to acquire DataStax, the longtime backer of the Apache Cassandra database that has recently broadened its reach into streaming data and generative AI. IBM cited DataStax’s capability to manage unstructured data as well as its vector database, which is used for developing RAG solutions.\n\nApache Cassandra was originally developed at Facebook in 2008 to serve the fledgling social network’s need for a highly scalable, fault-tolerant database to store big data generated by users on its website. Facebook was a big user and creator in the nascent big data ecosystem, building its social media empire atop non-relational technology like Apache Hadoop and HBase, another NoSQL data store, as well as Apache Hive, which it created to make Hadoop look like a relational database. (Facebook would eventually move back to using relational databases, specifically Postgres, but that is another story.)\n\nCassandra, which technically is a wide-column store that favors data availability and reliability (at the expense of data consistency), became a top-level project at the Apache Software Foundation in 2010. That is the same year that Jonathan Ellis and Matt Pfeil co-founded a company in Austin, Texas called Riptano, which it quickly renamed DataStax.\n\nAt first, DataStax followed the typical commercial open-source business model, offering an enterprise version of Apache Cassandra called DataStax Enterprise (DSE). The company, which had moved to Santa Clara, California by 2014, attracted customers from the Fortune 500, such as FedEx, Capital One, and Verizon. It has raised $106 million in venture capital at a $830 valuation, and was on pace for an IPO in the 2015 or 2016 timeframe.\n\nThat IPO never happened, as MongoDB dominated the NoSQL space and went public in 2017. In May 2020, DataStax launched Astra DB, a fully managed version of Cassandra running in the cloud atop Kassandra, giving customers the scalability and availability benefits of the NoSQL database but without the management responsibilities (like many distributed systems, Cassandra can be difficult to manage). Later that year, it released K8ssandra, an open source version of the database running atop the resource manager.\n\nSoon, the company started branching beyond NoSQL databases. In 2021, it launched Astra Streaming, an event streaming platform based on Apache Pulsar, a publish and subscribe (pub-sub) data platform that competes with Apache Kafka. In 2023, DataStax bought Kaskada, an AI startup that helped to automate tedious feature engineering tasks, and made the software open source under the Luna ML brand.\n\nDataStax further bolstered its generative AI capabilities in 2023 with the launch of a vector store in Astra DB. Vector stores emerged as critical tools for building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines to bolster the accuracy of large language model (LLM) output in generative AI applications. Then in 2024, DataStax further fleshed out its RAG story when it nabbed Langflow, which developed an open source framework for building RAG pipelines.\n\nAll of the accumulated capabilities that DataStax built and bought obviously caught the eye of IBM. Big Blue, which has been rallying its business to some degree on the back of its watsonx AI offerings, cited open source projects like Apache Cassandra, Apache Pulsar, Langflow, and OpenSearch (a branch of Elasticsearch and Kibana) in its press release announcing the acquisition.\n\nIBM is particularly enamored of how DataStax has built its unstructured data management capabilities under a single product. While it didn’t mention DataStax’s Hyper-Converged Data Platform (HCDP) by name, it seems clear that IBM is banking on harnessing the tech to help customers turn unstructured data into winning AI applications.\n\n“Unstructured data represents a treasure trove of untapped business intelligence, representing 93% of all enterprise data in 2024, according to IDC,” Ritika Gunnar, IBM’s general manager of data and AI, says in a blog post. “Harnessing the power of this data within generative AI applications is essential. But to do that, enterprises must first make order out of data chaos.”\n\nAccording to Gunnar, IBM wants to bring DataStax’s open source offerings together with its watsonx portfolio of products, specifically Apache Iceberg, Apache Spark, Velox, and Presto, to help customers leverage large amounts of unstructured data.\n\n“The data infrastructure required for AI is much more than just vector,’” Gunnar writes. “Many modalities of data–JSON, time-series, key/value, tabular, graph–need to come together to make the data ingest and search accurate and relevant. By having them built into a simplified and scalable solution (thanks to generative AI) users don’t have to stitch together a multitude of data representations to gain value from their enterprise data.)\n\nIn his own blog post, DataStax CEO Chet Kapoor discussed how DataStax and IBM have worked together with open source software (OSS) since 2020, including deploying DataStax products atop the IBM OpenShift platform.\n\n“We respect the leadership and stewardship that IBM has demonstrated with OSS and the great OSS companies that have found a home at IBM, like Red Hat and others, and we’re excited to become part of a company that understands the power of openness,” Kapoor writes. “With our technologies and IBM’s watsonx.data, their hybrid, open data lakehouse, we will be able to bring vector and AI search to the entire data estate and make IBM’s capabilities available to every developer.”\n\nTerms of the deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter, were not disclosed. DataStax was valued at $1.6 billion during its most recent funding round, in June 2022. The company has raised $342.6 million over several rounds. It has hundreds of paying customers, according to IBM.\n\nRelated Items:\n\nDataStax Rolls Out Vector Search for Astra DB to Support Gen AI\n\nDataStax Announces New K8ssandra Operator",

Integral to the release are Nvidia microservices and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) capability.\n\nHCDP is not hyper-converged infrastructure in the sense of being a hardware appliance or combined storage and server software, but is intended by DataStax to be deployed cloud-like and virtual in the customer environment.\n\nDataStax started out in 2010, and is rooted in the NoSQL database space. It also provides the cloud-based Astra DB database-as-a-service and DataStax Enterprise (DSE) for on-premise deployments. Version 6.9 of DSE comes alongside the launch of HCDP. Astra DB and DSE are both built on the Apache Cassandra NoSQL database.\n\nHCDP is aimed at customers that want to build their own GenAI infrastructure on-premise, said Bill McLane, chief technology officer for cloud at DataStax.\n\n“HCDP brings together generative AI and vector search capabilities to self-managed, enterprise data workloads,” he said. “So, companies that want to deliver generative AI services but don’t want to run in the cloud can achieve the same kinds of goals as cloud services can achieve.”\n\nMcLane said the product targets companies that want to run their own datacentres and ensure full control over how data is used in GenAI.\n\n“With this in place, companies can use generative AI with their own data and large language models, but without handing that data over to a third party where they are not in control over how that data gets used in practice,” said McLane.\n\nHCDP makes use of OpenSearch search and visualisation capabilities, as well as Apache Pulsar, a messaging platform used to build data pipelines, and load and distribute data.\n\nCore to HCDP and DataStax’s functionality is the use of vectors in GenAI, said McLane. “Generative AI systems pull data together in response to potential questions based on vector search queries,” he explained. “These queries are turned into vectors – mathematical representations of the words or concepts involved – and then compared with the existing set of vector data that the company has. This information is then provided back to the large language model and used to prepare the response back to the user.”\n\nAny data can be turned into vectors – product catalogues, previous customer histories or other unstructured data records – and can be stored ready for search.\n\nCustomers that want to use their own data in a GenAI system that uses a vector database alongside their transactional database can stream new data across to create and update vector data.",

      "# [IBM targets AI application growth with DataStax buy by michael_cooney, Michael Cooney, Anirban Ghoshal, Michael Cooney Senior Editor on 2025-02-25](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3832713/ibm-targets-ai-application-growth-with-datastax-buy.html)\nLooking to bolster its AI data handling and storage capabilities, IBM said it had entered an agreement to buy open-source database developer DataStax for an undisclosed amount.\n\nDataStax is known for Apache Cassandra, the firm’s open-source NoSQL database project featured in its AstraDB, DataStax Enterprise software portfolio.\n\nAccording to DataStax, Cassandra is a high-availability system that lets server clusters continue operating in the event of failure—an important consideration for generative AI and AI analytics development, IBM stated.\n\nIn particular, IBM said DataStax’s technology would be built into its watsonx portfolio of genAI products to help manage the vast amounts of unstructured data used in genAI application development.\n\nThousands of organizations including FedEx, Capital One, The Home Depot, and Verizon use Apache Cassandra. It offers scalability, availability, fault tolerance, high performance, and multi-data-center and hybrid cloud support, IBM stated. “Increasingly, Apache Cassandra users are leveraging the database for AI workloads. In this context, DataStax brings together a mature datastore with vector and graphRAG capabilities—a critical combination for harnessing unstructured data for [genAI],” IBM stated.\n\n“Businesses cannot realize the full potential of [genAI] without the right infrastructure—open-source tools and technologies that empower developers, harness unstructured data, and provide a strong foundation for AI applications,” Dinesh Nirmal, senior vice president of IBM Software, said in a statement.\n\nThe system supports Langflow a low-code, open-source app builder for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and multi-agent AI applications, IBM stated. “It is Python-based and model-, API-, and database-agnostic. Langflow adds additional flexible middleware capabilities to IBM watsonx.ai, the integrated, end-to-end AI development studio for building [genAI] applications,” IBM stated.\n\nDataStax competes with a variety of large database vendors including Oracle and MongoDB and has development partnerships with core cloud vendors such as Amazon, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. The company recently teamed with Nvidia to integrate its technology with the Nvidia AI Enterprise platform.\n\n“The acquisition of a prominent NoSQL database vendor focused on unstructured data management should nicely complement IBM’s long-time Db2 relational database offering,” equity research firm William Blair wrote in a report about the acquisition. “With respect to genAI, the deal should broaden the core capabilities of IBM’s Watsonx genAI platform, especially around managing unstructured and semi-structured data and simplifying an enterprise’s ability to develop cutting-edge AI applications around that data.”\n\nThe acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025.",
      "# [IBM Acquires DataStax to Enhance watsonx AI Platform and Solve Enterprise Data Challenges by International Business Machines Corp, StockTitan on 2025-02-25](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/IBM/ibm-to-acquire-data-stax-deepening-watsonx-capabilities-and-wj779l9ftqcz.html)\nIBM's planned acquisition of DataStax represents a strategic enhancement to its AI portfolio at a critical inflection point in enterprise AI adoption. This move directly addresses the data bottleneck plaguing generative AI implementations – with McKinsey reporting that 70% of companies with high-performing AI initiatives still struggle with data challenges.\n\nThe acquisition strengthens IBM's competitive positioning in the rapidly growing AI infrastructure market. DataStax's vector database capabilities are particularly valuable as they enable more efficient processing of unstructured data (like text, images, and audio) – essential for building effective generative AI applications. In practical terms, this means IBM clients can more easily integrate their vast stores of enterprise data into AI workflows, potentially accelerating AI ROI.\n\nThis transaction aligns with IBM's broader strategy of building a comprehensive AI platform while embracing open-source technologies. IBM has been systematically expanding its watsonx portfolio through both internal development and targeted acquisitions. The addition of DataStax's Apache Cassandra-based technologies complements IBM's existing data offerings while adding specialized vector search capabilities important for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, while terms weren't disclosed, this appears to be a technology-focused acquisition rather than a significant revenue driver in the near term. DataStax is privately held with hundreds of enterprise customers, suggesting modest but quality revenue. The real value lies in how these capabilities can accelerate adoption of IBM's broader AI platform and potentially increase the average revenue per customer.\n\nFor investors, this acquisition reinforces IBM's commitment to building a comprehensive enterprise AI stack and suggests the company is executing its AI strategy methodically. The transaction timing – expected to close in Q2 2025 – indicates standard regulatory review without anticipated complications. This acquisition should be viewed as part of IBM's ongoing transformation into a hybrid cloud and AI-focused enterprise, with potential to accelerate growth in its software segment, which has been a priority under CEO Arvind Krishna.\n\nIBM's acquisition of DataStax represents a strategic technology enhancement that addresses one of the most pressing challenges in enterprise AI adoption: efficiently utilizing vast stores of unstructured data. This move significantly strengthens IBM's AI infrastructure stack at a critical moment in the market.\n\nVector databases – DataStax's core technology – are the missing link many enterprises need for effective generative AI implementation. Unlike traditional databases optimized for structured data, vector databases excel at storing and retrieving the mathematical representations (embeddings) of text, images, and other unstructured content that power modern AI systems. This capability is essential for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which grounds AI responses in factual data rather than hallucinated information.\n\nThe integration of AstraDB into watsonx.data creates a more comprehensive data foundation for IBM's AI offerings. While IBM already had some vector capabilities, DataStax brings mature, enterprise-grade technology with proven scalability across massive datasets. The addition of graphRAG – which creates connections between related pieces of information – enables more sophisticated reasoning capabilities that basic RAG implementations lack.\n\nLangflow provides IBM with a critical tool for democratizing AI development. This low-code environment allows domain experts and developers with varying skill levels to collaborate on AI application development without deep machine learning expertise. This addresses a significant skills gap in the enterprise market and could accelerate adoption of IBM's broader AI platform.\n\nTechnologically, this acquisition positions IBM more competitively against both cloud hyperscalers (AWS, Microsoft, Google) and specialized AI infrastructure providers. While competitors offer vector database capabilities, IBM's integration of these technologies with its existing enterprise data management tools creates a more cohesive solution specifically designed for large organizations with complex data environments.\n\nThe commitment to maintaining open-source support is technically significant as it preserves compatibility with the broader ecosystem while allowing IBM to offer enterprise-grade enhancements. This hybrid approach mirrors IBM's successful Red Hat strategy and could accelerate adoption among organizations already invested in Apache Cassandra and related technologies.",
      "# [IBM to buy Cassandra specialist DataStax by Edward Targett on 2025-02-25](https://www.thestack.technology/ibm-to-buy-cassandra-specialist-datastax/)\nIBM has agreed to buy DataStax, a provider of managed and cloud-hosted Apache Cassandra database and Pulsar data streaming services.\n\nPrincipal technical strategist at DataStax Patrick McFadin said the deal “signals a strategic bet on the future of Cassandra” (an open-source NoSQL database deployed by the likes of Apple and Netflix.)\n\nThe deal is something of a triumph for CEO Chet Kapoor, who joined five years ago at a low point for DataStax. This will be the second company that he has sold to IBM; Kapoor was CEO of Gluecode when IBM bought it in 2005. As CEO he also successfully sold Apigee to Google in 2016.\n\nDataStax’s blue chip customers include Fedex, Home Depot, and T-Mobile. The terms of the deal were not initially disclosed. DataStax employees have been promised an information pack “later” today (February 25). The Stack will update this article if we hear more details on deal size.\n\nIBM’s proposed DataStax acquisition follows its $34 billion buyout of Red Hat in 2019 and its $6.4 billion bid* for Terraform creator HashiCorp – which British competition regulators approved today.\n\n“The project needs a lot of friends”\n\nThe proposed deal will leave many in the open-source community somewhat anxious: DataStax has had a complex relationship with the OSS Cassandra community but in recent years rebuilt partnerships and been a sustained, active contributor upstream, even as it also builds premium “enterprise” features separately for its “Astra” set of managed services.\n\nRitika Gunnar, General Manager, Data and AI, IBM, played up Big Blue’s commitment to open-source in a blog on the news, writing: “At IBM, we believe in the power of open source and the innovation driven by community collaboration… We share this belief with DataStax, who has continued to expand their stewardship of open source including Apache Cassandra, Langflow, OpenSearch, and more… we look forward to supporting and innovating alongside these communities, helping shape the future of enterprise data management and AI-driven solutions.”\n\nPosting on LinkedIn, McFadin wrote: “In 2011, the realistic question was whether Cassandra would survive the expansion and contraction of NoSQL. In 2025, the new question is whether Cassandra can be the default database for a generation. To get there, the project needs a lot of friends, and it has some great ones. Netflix, Apple, Bloomberg, Uber.\n\n“It’s a long list. Today, IBM joined the chorus. The Cassandra project momentum has been picking up and just got some big blue jet boots.”\n\nSee: \"DataStax Astra took Cassandra serverless. That's a game-changer\"\n\nDataStax CEO Chet Kapoor wrote: “DataStax’s NoSQL products—our cloud service, Astra DB, and self-managed DataStax Enterprise—have been the standard for scale-out data delivered on top of Cassandra.\n\n“DataStax and IBM have collaborated in the market since 2020, serving customers such as T-Mobile, Audi, The Home Depot, and Intuit.\n\n“Over the last year, DataStax introduced HCD and Mission Control, further bringing Cassandra into the cloud-native era, deployed on top of IBM OpenShift. We’re excited to continue making Cassandra the standard for scaling out cloud-native data for our existing and future customers.”\n\nThe deal follows DataStax’s April 2024 acquisition of Langflow, which provides a GUI for building retrieval augmented generation and other AI applications with LangChain. IBM said it sees Langflow as helping it add middleware development capabilities to its watsonx.ai platform.\n\nIt comes amid a busy week in the database space, with MongoDB yesterday unveiling plans to buy AI model/RAG specialist Voyage AI for $220 million in a cash and shares deal.\n\nReaction and more details to follow. Views? Pop us a line.\n\n*That latter deal was dubbed “Red Hash” by some; a moniker that arguably makes this one “Red Cass”, or perhaps “Red Stax\"; take your pick.",
