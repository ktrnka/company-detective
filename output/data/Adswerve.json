      "# [Results | World Surf League | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/wsl)\nWorld Surf League (WSL) is a digital-first sports league by design because no one knows exactly when the wave conditions will be right. They plan events around a two-week time window at locations around the globe. When the surf is up, the competition begins. Being all-digital allows WSL to publish content fast and stream surfing events as they occur. Fans can use a mobile app to watch live broadcasts and keep up to date with their favorite WSL athletes anywhere, anytime.\n\nAfter consolidating several live events from major surfing brands onto its own video streaming platform, WSL needed better answers to questions about viewership. How many fans engage regularly? How many tune in to multiple events? Who are the superfans — the ones who drive the majority of consumption and engagement— and which new users are most likely to become superfans?\n\nTo better understand fan behavior, WSL began using Google Analytics 360 to gather data from a variety of customer touchpoints and worked with us to accelerate time to value and keep data quality high.\n\nWe combined and cleaned data from Analytics 360, Facebook and WSL’s internal system into a single data lake and modeled superfan attributes using machine learning algorithms. We then applied early engagement attributes of superfans so WSL could focus its marketing on new users.\n\nThe fan insights WSL gained using Google Analytics 360 with Google BigQuery allowed the organization to reduce cost per conversion by more than 50%, which more than doubled the efficiency of ad spend aimed at driving fan engagement and content viewership.\n\nBy focusing on higher ROI customers, WSL drives greater fan engagement with live events and digital content—without increasing its marketing budget. When weather conditions deliver the best waves and large numbers of fans are looking at content, WSL can easily scale its analytics on demand. And during the offseason, it can scale down, which has allowed it to reduce infrastructure costs by 70%.\n\nNow its team can ask more sophisticated questions of its data: How do wave conditions affect viewership? How do athletes’ scores correlate with other factors such as wave height, time of day, or level of competition? And what exactly is a superfan worth to the business?\n\nDownload the full case study.",

      "# Post ID 14x7g7d: Is there a way to view GA4 events in the Chrome Developer Tools? with +1 score by [(maestro_man, Reddit, 2023-07-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleAnalytics/comments/14x7g7d/is_there_a_way_to_view_ga4_events_in_the_chrome/)\nHowdy! I'm a frontend dev working for an agency and a number of clients, and as would be expected, we are now beginning to implement a lot more custom metrics in GA4. \n\nMy question is: Assuming we do *not* have access to the GA4 dashboard/login itself, is there a way I can view GA4 events in the Chrome Dev Tools? For UA events, I could look at the \\`collect\\` calls in the Network tab, or I could use the \"Google Analytics Debugger\" Chrome extension and see logs in the console. I've tried the \"Debugger for Google Analytics 4\" extension and am having no luck, or mixed luck at best (not seeing any custom metrics at all, but some page view events and whatnot). \n\nAny help or insight would be greatly appreciated! Cheers!\n\n\n\n## Comment ID jrm2j6g with +5 score by [(Falcon_nz, Reddit, 2023-07-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleAnalytics/comments/14x7g7d/is_there_a_way_to_view_ga4_events_in_the_chrome/jrm2j6g/) (in reply to ID 14x7g7d):\nI use ga4 debugger extension\n\n### Comment ID kqiho9m with +1 score by [(Frequent_Meeting_743, Reddit, 2024-02-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleAnalytics/comments/14x7g7d/is_there_a_way_to_view_ga4_events_in_the_chrome/kqiho9m/) (in reply to ID jrm2j6g):\nI don't want to use any extension.

Have never used this tool. This could be something to explore. As I mentioned elsewhere, it's more of a workflow issue, as I'd love for something to log right in my face or in the console as I click around a site to check buttons, links, add to carts, etc. This is intriguing and I'll def give it a proper look, but the idea of having to open up this additional window in a fresh incognito window (when I'm testing changes) in order to see events in a separate tab feels a little clunky. Will 100% give it a run, though!

The issue is more around workflow. I work with a lot of ecommerce companies, so I'm checking a lot of custom metrics on button/link clicks, modals opening, adds to cart, etc., and having these actions logged out in front of me as I click around the site would be ideal. Also, I won't be able to check the dataLayer if a link click navigates me away from the current page (unless the link allows me to cmd+click to open a new tab, but that's still annoying). May toy with writing my own little solution to leverage the dataLayer.\n\nAlso not seeing any GA4 calls in the Network tab filtered by \"google\" or the measurement ID. :shrug:\n\nI'm still learning, so I may totally be screwing something up haha!

That would help narrow the scope. \n\nMost of the \\*good\\* DSPs have minimums of some sort, whether that is the monthly or annual spend commitment, or minimum per buy. All of the ones you listed have fairly hefty annual commitments, but are mostly recognized as being in the upper class of DSPs in terms of features, inventory, and integrations (DV360 and TTD usually at the very top of that list, as well as for cost.) Others worth mentioning in this class are Basis and Adobe Ad Cloud -- both require commitments. If you can justify an annual commitment of $250k, you can get in the door with Basis, MediaMath, maybe Xandr? \n\nSome of the DSPs have resellers, who can hook you up with a seat without the monstrous commitment. There are a number of them for DV360, but you still need to be spending quite a bit per month to justify it. \n\nA few other lower tier DSPs can still get you a lot of what you want -- depending on what your requirements are. There's always Google Ads as the default -- this gets you display and YouTube. \n\nI really like StackAdapt. No commitments, but is fully featured in a nice UI. Lots of integrations with other platforms. Display, video, native. \n\nPontiac Media is a pretty solid offering. The UI isn't great, but the tech underneath is built upon Xandr, so is fairly robust. It has a small monthly fee of like $25 if you aren't actively spending anything, but otherwise no commitment.\n\n### Comment ID jm8jljf with +5 score by [(doug_kaplan, Reddit, 2023-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/13vw8sy/best_entry_level_dsp/jm8jljf/) (in reply to ID jm8hxcs):\nI second StackAdapt, no minimum monthly spend and no contract so makes it easy to dip your toes in or leave with ease and is fairly full featured.\n\n### Comment ID jmb49lb with +1 score by [(MirsadZ, Reddit, 2023-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/13vw8sy/best_entry_level_dsp/jmb49lb/) (in reply to ID jm8hxcs):\nThanks so much for the detailed explanation.\nFor context we still don't know the exact budget.

So, here are a few things I would try.\n\n- Make sure there isn't anything blocking the firing of GA4, like deferring the JS load or any other site speed attempts. I've seen this happen where it'll track during my testing and all default GA4 events fire, but my custom stuff doesn't. \n\n- Really odd and depends on the site/CMS, but clear any cache on the site as well. You'd think it shouldn't matter since you are using GTM, but I was able to resolve a similar issue by flushing the cache in the CMS. Odd for sure, but it worked. \n\n- If you are talking about \"key events/conversions,\" you need to actually toggle those on. but if they are not firing to begin with, that's a bit more challenging.\n\n- Really, really small thing (but I've done it before, especially if you are working with a large amount of sites), double check that the GA4 ID you have in GTM matches the account you except them to be under. Like I said, small, but we've all done that from time to time.\n\nHope that helps and good luck!\n\n## Comment ID lfo5unm with +2 score by [(CO_PC_Parts, Reddit, 2024-07-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/1efqipk/events_from_gtm_not_showing_in_the_ga4_reports/lfo5unm/) (in reply to ID 1efqipk):\nDid you publish the gtm container?

So if you wanted to pick first touch attribution, it should (in theory) lower the value of any last touch paid search exposure.. How would google know how I measure success?\n\nAlso from a technical level, are we talking about floodlight containers integration on a site/app level? because then theres really no way that google would know what the business value is of those pixel fires (unless you declare them as transactions & pass custom variables back). If a search term leads someone to a contact us page, how would google know this has value or not? Maybe my lead goes offline and i dont pass any event data back?  \n\nFrom a high up pixel fire view, how would they be able to distinguish a pixel event that has a business value, looking into the path to conversion to determine how i measure success, find the associate keyword ID from google ads (this negates broad match too), and increase the cost of those keywords?\n\n### Comment ID k3u8bex with +1 score by [(SucksAtGaming, Reddit, 2023-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/171id5w/alternatives_to_amazon_ad_serversizmek/k3u8bex/) (in reply to ID k3rgvc0):\nTheir CPM rates for ad serving are pretty high though compared to Sizmek, don't know about CM.\n\n## Comment ID k3tyv1a with +3 score by [(Charming_Beginning_4, Reddit, 2023-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/171id5w/alternatives_to_amazon_ad_serversizmek/k3tyv1a/) (in reply to ID 171id5w):\nAdform or Campaign Manager.

Could you elaborate on #9?\n\nWhat sort of automation should every advanced Google Ads manager know?\n\nDoes knowledge of the specialized industries in #11 improve overall knowledge of Google Ads' ability to pull in leads or are the experience gained with those accounts just good to have under your belt?\n\n#### Comment ID looy4i2 with +1 score by [(josiahlyoung, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1ceqv2p/advanced_paid_search_skills/looy4i2/) (in reply to ID l1p0u53):\nu/MFSkunk17 I think #9 is referring to cookie consent (CMP) platforms\n\n## Comment ID l1ogi41 with +1 score by [(DenuncioCohaero236, Reddit, 2024-04-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1ceqv2p/advanced_paid_search_skills/l1ogi41/) (in reply to ID 1ceqv2p):\n9 years in and you're feeling stagnant? Impressive! I'd love to see more discussion on this. One advanced skill that comes to mind is leveraging custom audiences and segmented bidding strategies. Anyone else have some hidden gems to share?\n\n### Comment ID l1p032d with +1 score by [(MFSkunk17, Reddit, 2024-04-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1ceqv2p/advanced_paid_search_skills/l1p032d/) (in reply to ID l1ogi41):\nTrue! However, do bid adjustments on audiences/segments actually do anything within a Manual CPC bidding strategy? If so, I haven't seen it!\n\n## Comment ID l1kw6zw with +1 score by [(vizoo, Reddit, 2024-04-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1ceqv2p/advanced_paid_search_skills/l1kw6zw/) (in reply to ID 1ceqv2p):\nThis is the way I see it.\n\nBeginning - knowing what the platform is\n\nPro - being able to successfully implement strategies and work with things that affect the platform (ex: Landing Page CRO)\n\nAdvanced - Being able to come up with strategies (including the above)\n\n### Comment ID l1ln590 with +1 score by [(MFSkunk17, Reddit, 2024-04-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1ceqv2p/advanced_paid_search_skills/l1ln590/) (in reply to ID l1kw6zw):\nVery true. I guess these skills get taken for granted once we've been doing them long enough. I've never had a mentor or coworker to learn from so I have no idea where I stack up."

Lots of third-hand feedback delivered through your boss because people are too cowardly to say what's on their mind. \n-Clueless, unaccountable leadership: Company touts that they didn't lay anyone off during the pandemic, then lays off 5% of the company last year, then continues to tout that they didn't lay anyone off!\n-Backstabbing Culture: No one is willing to deliver DIRECT feedback. Get used to having someone talk to your boss about you! It squashes any attempt at asking for help out of fear that someone will perceive it as weakness, resulting in termination. \n-High turnover: People disappear under \"suspicious circumstances\" (often at terrible times for client and project health). Executives are not exempt from this either. The company lost their COO and chief salesperson recently, then worked to spin their departure as a coincidence instead of a reflection of the company. Womp womp. \n-Inconsistent and contradictory goal requirements: There is no incentive to do strategic work that could make the company better when all of the company's goals and OKRs are about sales and billable time. Templates for docs like SOWs and legal-approved contracts desperately need overhauling, but no one has time or bandwidth to work on those tasks over client work. \n-Awful clients: Adswerve lives off its relationships with companies like Google and Adobe, so they often get the dregs that can't or won't pay for a real consulting firm. \n-Sneaky HR Practices: I've never heard of a company treating cost-of-living increases as \"merit\" increases. This is insulting, especially during a time of record inflation.",

As we navigate through economic fluctuations, know that we remain committed to fair and competitive total rewards practices that recognize the hard work and achievement of our team members.\n\nWe strive to create a positive and supportive work environment and are disappointed to learn that we’ve fallen short in your case. Your feedback is important, and we’d like to discuss your concerns further. If you’re open to it, we’d like to talk to you about this in more detail - please reach out to your HRBP.",

          "cons": "If I could, I would give this organization zero stars. I also need to call out the blatantly fake review left on 11/16/24 titled “Great company.” It’s obvious this was written by executives to boost ratings. If you’re going to resort to leaving fake reviews, at least put some effort into making them believable.\n\nOver the past year, the organization has drastically declined, losing any redeeming qualities it once had. The people-first culture we prided ourselves on is now completely absent.\n\nDespite claiming a lack of budget for promotions, leadership decided to allocate funds toward a poorly executed summit. This event was not only meaningless and cheaply run but also a blatant misallocation of resources. The money spent on the summit could have been used for employee bonuses or well-deserved promotions. Instead, it became a waste of time and a demoralizing reminder for employees who were told promotions weren’t feasible due to budget constraints.\n\nMedia leadership implemented one of the most poorly planned and executed reorgs, and the fallout has affected everyone. Morale is at an all-time low, employees are stretched impossibly thin, and micromanagement has become the norm. While reorgs are rarely perfect, this one was carelessly conceived and disastrously implemented, with employees left to bear the brunt of its failure. Many were reassigned to new roles without clarity or job descriptions—an unethical move that created confusion and resentment. Others were left juggling both their previous responsibilities and new, undefined workloads.\n\nTo make matters worse, a major KPI was retroactively increased four months into the year. This left employees scrambling not only to hit an increased target going forward but also to make up for the gap retroactively. The decision lacked fairness, foresight, and consideration\n\nWhile the department’s employees continue to support one another, senior leaders and executives should be deeply ashamed of their actions. Their decisions have left employees overworked, undervalued, and utterly demoralized. \n\nPay is below market rate, leadership is reckless, morale is low, and growth opportunities are scarce.",

This will also throw off any career planning you had, so say goodbye to any chance at that promotion that seemed in reach. You aren’t gonna see it!\n- Our top leadership is insufferable. To lay people off weeks before Christmas, drop our yearly performance raises, just to turn around two months into the new year with the great news that we acquired another company….. has anyone looked up the definition of “tone deaf” in their life? To be told that I should be “lucky” to be receiving a 1% raise???

You'll probably get more knowledge in your first year here than you would in your typical Master's Degree.  The starting pay is competitive and the benefits are the best I've ever had.  As you grow within the company hard work is generously rewarded with regular raises and bonuses.  The success of the company is shared with all employees, which is a pretty rare thing these days.  \r\n\r\nWork life balance is a big deal and while an especially busy time or a unique circumstance might have you checking in on something in the evening or on a weekend there's an expectation to leave your work at the office and enjoy your life.  Full-time means 40 hours, which is rare in a lot of agencies where this can be seen as more of a 'starting place'.\r\n\r\nThe holiday parties are a blast, snacks and drinks are provided, ping pong and Nintendo during the slower times.",

You are rated as an employee according to how many billable hours you have per quarter. It incentivizes you to not take time off because if you do you get the added stress of worrying about when you will make up the time you took off. Pretty messed up.",

This is only a small issue compared to the bigger issue below which is focused around gaining job experience and growth. \n\n- Extremely slow to grow from an entry-level standpoint and KPI’s for billable hours (1300 per year which isn’t a lot) unable to be met. This is mostly due to a combination of bottleneck in client work (not enough to go around) as well as preference for skilled workers to be put on client work opposed to ones that don’t have much experience. My feedback here would be to allow the hire to shadow these working sessions and maybe even get them involved in some way so that the opportunity for growth is still there. \n\nThey don’t necessarily have to bill the client for it; but it’ll help facilitate learning as opposed to just being shut out of projects due to lack of skill and being placed on the back burner.\n\n- Sometimes, leadership will have disagreements in what feedback they give to an employee. A director will say one thing whilst approaching employee separately without manager, and a manager will say another in a separate meeting. It’s hard to tell what exactly leadership wants.",

This is mostly due to a combination of bottleneck in client work (not enough to go around) as well as preference for skilled workers to be put on client work opposed to ones that don’t have much experience. My feedback here would be to allow the hire to shadow these working sessions and maybe even get them involved in some way so that the opportunity for growth is still there. \n\nThey don’t necessarily have to bill the client for it; but it’ll help facilitate learning as opposed to just being shut out of projects due to lack of skill and being placed on the back burner.\n\n- Sometimes, leadership will have disagreements in what feedback they give to an employee.

Get used to having someone talk to your boss about you! It squashes any attempt at asking for help out of fear that someone will perceive it as weakness, resulting in termination. \n-High turnover: People disappear under \"suspicious circumstances\" (often at terrible times for client and project health).

Womp womp. \n-Inconsistent and contradictory goal requirements: There is no incentive to do strategic work that could make the company better when all of the company's goals and OKRs are about sales and billable time. Templates for docs like SOWs and legal-approved contracts desperately need overhauling, but no one has time or bandwidth to work on those tasks over client work. \n-Awful clients: Adswerve lives off its relationships with companies like Google and Adobe, so they often get the dregs that can't or won't pay for a real consulting firm. \n-Sneaky HR Practices: I've never heard of a company treating cost-of-living increases as \"merit\" increases.

Instead, it became a waste of time and a demoralizing reminder for employees who were told promotions weren’t feasible due to budget constraints.\n\nMedia leadership implemented one of the most poorly planned and executed reorgs, and the fallout has affected everyone. Morale is at an all-time low, employees are stretched impossibly thin, and micromanagement has become the norm.

      "# [Third-Party Cookie Delay: A Reprieve, Not a Respite for Marketers on 2024-04-25](https://adswerve.com/blog/third-party-cookie-delay-a-reprieve-not-a-respite-for-marketers)\nGoogle has pushed back the end of third-party cookies (3PC) in Chrome yet again, with a new target of early 2025. This news offers a sigh of relief for some, but it's crucial to remember this is a delay and not a cancellation. Let's unpack what this means for the industry, and how you can make the most of this reprieve using the additional resources provided below.\n\nA Shifting Timeline\n\nRemember when 2020 was supposed to be the year of the 3PC apocalypse? The industry spoke, and Google listened. Here's the revised timeline:\n\nJanuary 2020: Google initially announced plans to phase out 3PC within two years.\n\nFebruary 2022: The first delay hit, with the sunset pushed to late 2023.\n\nJanuary 2024: The timeline shifted again, targeting a mid-2024 deprecation.\n\nApril 2024: Google’s most recent update places the official end date in early 2025.\n\nWhy the Delay?\n\nTwo key factors contributed to Google's decision:\n\nIndustry Concerns: Marketers and developers expressed a need for more time to adapt and explore alternatives. Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative, designed to replace 3PC tracking, needed further refinement.\n\nRegulatory Scrutiny: Antitrust investigations, particularly from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), prompted Google to address competition concerns before completely phasing out 3PC.\n\nWhat This Means for the Privacy Sandbox Initiatives\n\nWhile the phase-out of third-party cookies (3PC) has been pushed back to early 2025, most initiatives within the Privacy Sandbox, including the Topics API, Protected Audience API and Attribution Reporting API, are still on track for a Q3 2024 rollout.\n\nTesting Time Extended: The delay offers valuable extra time for developers and testers to refine Privacy Sandbox solutions within Chrome. This translates to potentially smoother functionality and a more seamless transition for advertisers when 3PC finally sunsets. Solutions in development include:\n\nEnhanced Cohort Targeting: Refining how advertisers target audience segments based on similar interests or browsing behaviors without relying on individual user identifiers.\n\nImproved Contextual Targeting: Testing methods for analyzing the context of webpages and content to deliver relevant ads without user tracking.\n\nPrivacy-Preserving Attribution: Developing solutions that accurately measure campaign effectiveness while upholding user privacy standards.\n\nIntegration Focus: Expect continued development on integrating these Sandbox solutions with Google Marketing Platform (GMP) products like Display & Video 360 (DV360) and Campaign Manager 360 (CM360). This will ensure a streamlined workflow for managing campaigns after 3PC deprecation.\n\nAddressing Industry Feedback: Google can use the additional time to incorporate valuable industry feedback. This could lead to increased transparency around how the Sandbox works, more open collaboration with stakeholders and potential adjustments to features based on advertiser needs.\n\nBonus time for website owners:\n\nThe delay also offers an advantage for website owners. Here are two proposals where you can take action:\n\nRelated Website Sets (RWS): Do you have a company with websites on multiple domains (e.g., brandx.com and fly-brandx.com) or domains for different countries (such as example.com, example.rs, example.uk, etc.)? RWS lets these sites share cookies. With the delay, you have more time to submit your domains for approval within RWS. Pro Tip: Make sure your domains meet the RWS guidelines before Q3 2024.\n\nCHIPS (SameSite=Lax for Cookies with Partitioned Storage): Do you use embedded services like chat widgets? CHIPS allows these services to use cookies with your main website. The extra time allows you to test and implement CHIPS if it works for your website.\n\n“While 2025 is now the official 3PC end date, acting now is the smart move. At Adswerve, we’re constantly testing solutions that will work best for advertisers and website owners while prioritizing user privacy. We’re also aggressively exploring Privacy Sandbox initiatives and finding ways to best utilize those solutions for our clients. The time for complacency is over; let’s get to work.”\n\n- Luka Cempre, Senior Data Scientist\n\nWhat This Means for Marketers\n\nMore Time to Adapt: This delay offers a valuable window to test and refine cookieless marketing strategies. Focus on collecting first-party (1P) data directly from your users. Integrate this with data from your own systems (like your CMS) to create a powerful, unified customer picture. Leverage user modeling and contextual targeting to deliver relevant experiences, and explore alternative identifiers to enhance your reach.\n\nUrgency Still Exists: While the deadline shifts, the cookieless future is inevitable. Don't get complacent. Prioritize building a sustainable, privacy-first marketing approach.\n\n“The viability of 3PC has been degrading for years. The playbook for how to respond is the same today as it was before this delay. Marketers should continue moving ahead with their plans as if 3rd party cookies are already gone.”\n\n- Jake Winter, Principal Lead\n\nWhat This Means for Agencies\n\nUpskilling Opportunity: Invest in training your team on cookieless solutions, data privacy regulations and alternative targeting methods.\n\nClient Education Is Key: Guide your clients through the upcoming changes and their impact on campaigns.\n\nNew Revenue Streams Emerge: Expertise in 1P data and privacy-compliant measurement can be a valuable asset for agencies.\n\n“Time is a finite thing, and I implore our agency partners to look at the extra time as an opportunity to focus on actioning the long-term plans that pertain to cookie deprecation rather than short-term fixes. Agencies should continue working with their clients to test and learn durable cookieless solutions, so they have more concrete and proven strategies in place when the deadline comes. Keep pushing forward; 2025 will be here faster than we think.”- Kelly Hayes, Director of Account Management, Agency\n\nWhat This Means for The Google Marketing Platform (GMP)\n\nFocus on Privacy Sandbox: Expect to see continued development and testing of Privacy Sandbox integrations within DV360, CM360 and other platforms. These solutions will leverage technologies like Conversion Domains and Floodlight Conversion Categories to help you reach your target audiences effectively while respecting user privacy.\n\n1P Data Takes Center Stage: Look for further development of tools within GMP to streamline 1P data collection and campaign integration. Focus on collaborating with internal teams to gather as much 1P data as possible and leverage GMP for seamless data utilization.\n\nGA4 Remains Central: Expect ongoing development of GA4's functionalities for collecting and analyzing privacy-compliant data. Use the extended timeframe to test and refine existing workflows and explore new possibilities within GA4, including:\n\nSetting up GA4 for media measurement.\n\nEstablishing audience segmentation strategies.\n\nConfiguring BigQuery data exports.\n\nImplementing event-based bidding tactics.\n\n“The net result is unaffected. We were just given a little gift of being able to connect and align more between upcoming Summer PTOs and hectic calendars. We have the opportunity to feel a little less anxious, but media and analytics teams shouldn’t cancel 3PCD-related items like team meetings, roadmap developments or strategy change approvals. Instead, use the given time to double down and really think about what GMP strategies will be the best suited for your goals and needs, rather than rushing to accomplish a baseline ‘good enough’ because there wasn’t enough time.\"\n\n- Mary Kotara, Lead Consultant, Media\n\n“Cookies will live on into 2025, but focusing on your 3PCD readiness shouldn’t change. Taking actionable steps within the respective GMP platforms, dialing in your 1P data strategy and shaping your overall mindset to make sure you’re prepared should remain top priorities.”\n\n- Jeff Collins, Associate Director, Media Activation\n\nA Final Note\n\nWhile Google extends the timeline for phasing out 3PC, it's important to remember that other browsers like Safari and Firefox have already blocked 3PC. Use this delay to your advantage — experiment, build a strong data foundation and emerge from this shift stronger than ever.\n\nDon't wait until the very last minute — the future is now, and it's privacy-focused.\n\n\"This delay gives the industry a brief reprieve, but it doesn’t mean you should slow down or sideline any efforts you have in development. Anything done now to build a 1P data strategy is only going to get you further ahead of the curve!\"\n\n- Lars von Sneidern, Sr. Director of Analytics / Services Product Manager\n\nNeed help developing and executing your strategy for 3PC deprecation?

      "# [Adswerve DataLayer Inspector+ (2024 Version Update) by Adswerve on 2024-11-07](https://adswerve.com/resources/adswerve-datalayer-inspector-plus)\nWe are pleased to launch the latest version of the dataLayer Inspector+.\n\nLatest Version\n\nUpdate Notes: v2024.11.1.1\n\nDue to new restrictions on external script tags in Chrome extensions, the \"Insert GTM Container\" option has been removed from dataLayer Inspector+. Follow these steps to insert a GTM container into a web page with the \"Inject Code\" feature instead:\n\n1) Go to tagmanager.google.com.\n\n2) Under the Admin tab for your container, select \"Install Google Tag Manager.\"\n\n3) As shown in the screenshot below, where it says \"Paste this code as high in the <head> of the page as possible,\" copy just the snippet code content. Note: Do not include <script> or </script>, only the code between them.\n\n4) In the DataLayer Inspector popup, under \"Add Functionality,\" check \"Inject Code.\"\n\n5) Paste the code snippet from Tag Manager into the text box that appears.\n\n6) Click the button to \"Save Settings & Reload.\"\n\nThe GTM container will be inserted until the \"Inject Code\" box is unchecked and \"Save Settings & Reload\" is clicked again. Be sure to do this when you've finished testing.\n\nOverview\n\nWhat is the Inspector+?\n\nThe dataLayer Inspector+ is a Chrome extension that provides real-time, information-rich viewing of data layer activity and Google Analytics hits as they happen in the Developer Tools console. In addition, it has other features that support development and web analytics debugging.\n\nSummary\n\nThe UI packs all the features into a compact, easy-to-use set of options.\n\nAdd functionality\n\nProvides additional abilities beyond the basic features: e.g., intercept the console (show Inspector+ output when console logging is blocked by a site), push events to the data layer, and add code to the page.\n\nControl output\n\nEnhance or hide outputs: e.g., console highlights, specific events, and specific properties.\n\nAdditional options are available under \"Control output\" by expanding the \"Developer Output\" submenu. These include Show Mouse Events, Show Timing, Show postMessage, Show Mutations, and Hide Call Stack.\n\nOther analytics\n\nObserve code and network activity for other analytics implementations: Google Marketing, Facebook, Tealium, Adobe DTM, Adobe Analytics, Segment, GTM Server-Side, and Custom.\n\nHandy links\n\nGet links to relevant documentation and resources.\n\nBasic use\n\nThe badge will indicate current settings with color and short text.\n\n- On\n\n- Off\n\n- Classic Mode\n\n- dataLayer.push\n\n- Code Inserted\n\nConsole output\n\nBanner\n\nHRef\n\nHref is document.location.href at the time the Inspector loads on the page, and could be different from what is in the address bar or what is sent in DL and DP, especially when the page is a Single Page Application (SPA). Shortcut: Clicking on the HRef will take you to the source code in the Sources tab. Similar to right-clicking and selecting View Source, but you can \"Pretty Print\" the source in the developer tools view.\n\nReferrer\n\nThis is document.referrer when the Inspector loads on the page. It may not be the same as seen in the GA hit in the dr parameter. Analytics.js does not include the referrer from the same domain and single page applications Notes: In Single Page Applications (SPA), this banner remains at the top, and the HRef and referrer do not change.\n\nFilter\n\nUse the Tilde (~) to exclude non-Inspector console logs. Make sure you have \"All levels\" selected.\n\nCollapsed banner\n\nIf you'd like to save space in the console, you can select \"Collapse banner\" in the \"Control output\" options. This will hide the hint and filter note.\n\nData Layer Pushes\n\nAnatomy of dataLayer.pushes (and other analytics calls)\n\nSummary - console.groupCollapsed(...)\n\nThe summary includes a logo, brand, object, function, key and value. If there is no event, and multiple keys, \"Object - Expand for details\" is displayed.\n\nDetails\n\nEach push contains details of the push: e.g., stringified object, pointer to the push currently in memory (it will not be there on the next page when preserve log is checked), and the call stack. When showing timing, it will include seconds to the thousandth since Document Start (when the Inspector was first loaded). Uses: See the stringified content of the data layer push. See evaluations when the Summary is not green. Access the Call Stack. See timing when turned on.\n\nObject Pushed (or Arguments)\n\nThe stringified object shows the type of entity pushed to the data layer (Object or Arguments) and a formatted version of the entity (that will be there on the next page, when preserve log is checked, and can be copied and pasted into the console to replay). Use: See the values of the push, even from previous pages.\n\nCurrently in memory\n\nThis is a link to the actual object in memory. The topmost line is accurate for when the object was pushed to the data layer. When you click on the arrow to the left of the object, (after the colon), the object will expand and an information symbol will display. This indicates that the value of the object was evaluated on the click. Notice that the event value in the top line is different from the second line. This is because the event value was modified after the push and before the click.\n\nUses: To see what is in the data layer push when the object is too large or too complex to stringify.\n\nCall stack\n\nLinks to the code that executed from the start to the console.log are shown in the expanded \"Call Stack.\" The top links are inside the Inspector+. The bottom link is to the line of code that initiated the push. The link before function [as push], is to the code that called dataLayer.push. Uses: Understanding where the data layer push comes from or what code initiated the push.\n\nCommon Data Layer pushes\n\nThese pushes are seen on every page when GTM is installed and only once per page. Gotchas: Using these events in a Single Page Application. For example, using gtm.js as a pageview in a SPA will only send a pageview when the page first loads.\n\ngtm.js\n\nPushed from gtm and gtag snippets.\n\ngtm.start is the time the push was made MDN - \"the numeric value corresponding to the current time - the number of milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC with leap seconds ignored.\" The stack is not available when the script runs before the Inspector was loaded.\n\n(function(w,d,s,l,i) {\n\nw[l] = w[l] || [];\n\nw[l].push({\n\n'gtm.start': new Date().getTime(),\n\nevent: 'gtm.js'\n\n});\n\nvar f = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],\n\nj = d.createElement(s),\n\ndl = l != 'dataLayer' ? '&l=' + l : '';\n\nj.defer=true;\n\nj.src= '//www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;\n\nf.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);\n\n})(window,document,'script','gdGlobals','GTM-XXXXX');\n\nGotchas: 1. gtag and gtm pushes look different in the data layer, but are seen as the same in GTM. A data layer push from gtag with Arguments containing js and the date/time will be evaluated by GTM the same as the above event: 'gtm.js'\n\nNeeded data in the hit that isn't there when the event triggers.\n\nUses: Understanding when the GTM Pageview is triggered and, when the call stack is available, seeing the code that pushes the event.\n\ngtm.dom\n\nPushed from GTM when \"The DOMContentLoaded event fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.\" MDN The document object is ready. Uses: When you need to access the DOM.\n\ngtm.load\n\n\"The load event is fired when a resource and its dependent resources have finished loading.\" MDN Gotchas: gtm.load is not a reliable event in some sites, especially publication sites, because resources may load very slowly and sometimes get blocked.\n\nNetwork hits: anatomy of network hits\n\nSummary\n\nThe summary includes a logo, brand, type and more information. The Google Tag ID appears after the event name. The brand and type are color-coded with three levels: green is good, brown is worth noting and red is an error.\n\nData sent\n\nThe stringified object shows the data sent (that will be there on the next page, when preserve log is checked).\n\nEvaluations\n\nGeneral conventions\n\nGreen is good\n\nPageview hit is valid and contains recommended CD(s)\n\nBrown is a notice\n\nPushes should have an event key:\n\nMultiple GTM containers push gtm.js\n\nSnippet not in the head, as per spec\n\nRed is bad\n\nDuplicate Pageviews, dataLayer reset\n\nExamples of evaluations\n\nData Layer Reset\n\nSometimes, data layers are initialized incorrectly, and after data has been pushed to the data layer. When the data layer has data and is reset using syntax like dataLayer = [], and the Inspector is observing the data layer, you will see the following error in the console. NOTE: This evaluation can only happen if the Inspector+ is observing the data layer at the time of the reset.\n\nDemonstration: Inject this code into a site with a dataLayer.\n\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\",(event) => { window.dataLayer = [{stuff: 'stuffing'}] });\n\nGTM Snippet Location\n\nThe GTM snippet should be installed in the HEAD element. If it is not, you’ll see a console log of a notice with a link to the script. You can click the arrow to see the script. Right-click on the script to \"Reveal in Elements Panel\".\n\nGTM and gtag Configuration Evaluated\n\nThese evaluations are in early alpha. The evaluation is done on gtm.load (when all should have been loaded). Sorting through the implementation combinations and the implications is an emerging effort.\n\nMultiple containers using the same data layer\n\nMultiple GTM Containers\n\nControls\n\nInspect\n\nOn/off Auto detect dataLayer\n\nNaming the dataLayer can provide better sequencing of pushes and hits\n\nOptions\n\nClassic Mode\n\nThe Original Version\n\nUse: When you feel nostalgic about the simple days of Digital Analytics.\n\nJSON-ld\n\nAdd Functionality\n\n- .push({})\n\nPushes an object to the dataLayer (or named data layer) when the Inspector+ is loaded on the page. Usually used when testing GTM and the data needs to be in the data layer asap.\n\nTo use, add quoted key (e.g. \"event\") and value (e.g. \"dataLayer-push\") pairs with colon in between, separated by commas for multiple sets.\n\nInject Code\n\nInserts a script tag into the head. The code will run immediately upon insertion.\n\nUse: When you want to add code to the page immediately or on an event. Hint: To delay until the DOM is ready, use addEventListener: e.g.\n\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\",(event) => {\n\n// Do your stuff here: e.g. dataLayer.push…\n\nwindow.dataLayer.push({\n\nevent: 'example-event',\n\nstuff: 'stuffing'\n\n})\n\n});\n\nControl output\n\nCollapse Banner\n\nReduces the space taken up by the banner.\n\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\nUses: When you don’t need to be reminded about the console filter: e.g., a tilde(~) excludes non-Inspector+ console messages.\n\nShow Client ID\n\nAppends the client ID (cid) after the property ID of the pageview hit.\n\nHide Highlights\n\nTurns off the highlights for hits.\n\nUses: When you don't care if you don't see the hits and the highlights distract you.\n\nHide specific events\n\nSometimes developers get verbose with data layer pushes and you may want to ignore one or more events. This uses a Regex match, so you can block multiple events you want with a well-formed regex. Use: Hide data layer push events.\n\nShow hits to a specific property\n\nThis will limit the GA output to one specific property. Use: When there are multiple properties and you are only interested in one.\n\nAdditional options under \"Developer Output\"\n\nShow postMessage\n\nListens to window.message and pushes to the dataLayer the origin, data and the MessageEvent.\n\nUses: Communication monitoring from iFrames is a common use case: e.g., cross-domain tracking, video events and ads.\n\nShow Mutations\n\nSets listeners on the head and body element of the DOM and logs the array of changes when they happen.\n\nUses: Answering the questions \"What is changing, and when is it changing?\"\n\nHide Call Stack\n\nDoes not retrieve and display the call stack in the data layer push details. Use: Declutter the data layer push details.\n\nShow Timing\n\nThe number of seconds since the document start (when the Inspector+ was first loaded), in thousands of seconds.\n\nDoes not retrieve and display the call stack in the dataLayer.push details.\n\nUse: Declutter the dataLayer push details. Show Timing dataLayer.push The number of seconds since the document start (when the Inspector+ was first loaded), in thousands of seconds.\n\nUse: Measure how long it takes for an event to happen or the duration of tag processing: push processing time. The number of milliseconds the code takes to process the push; from push to callback.\n\nNOTE : Both gtag and GTM process data layer pushes.\n\nOther analytics\n\nGoogle Marketing\n\nFloodlight and other Google Marketing hits are displayed in the console.\n\nAdobe _satelite\n\nAdobe's legacy tag management system, Dynamic Tag Manager, is being replaced by Launch. The feature is early Alpha, meaning it’s incomplete and may not be reliable.\n\nAdobe Analytics\n\nLike Google Analytics, Adobe sends tracking hits to their own platform. The Inspector+ will monitor the hits and display them in the console similarly to how GA hits are displayed. The feature is early Alpha, meaning it’s incomplete and may not be reliable.\n\nTealium\n\nThis is a tag management system (TMS) that is agnostic to the analytics platform. The inspector monitors view and link calls and displays the calls in the console, similarly to data layer pushes. This feature is in advanced beta and is planned to be released to the public.\n\nFacebook\n\nLike Google Analytics and Adobe, Facebook sends hits to their own platform. Like GA and Adobe hits, these are displayed in the console.\n\nCustom Analytics\n\nThis feature will add a \"monkey patch\" to a function on an object and when the function is called, it will log to the console something similar to dataLayer.push. Examples: window.addEventListener, dataLayer.push\n\nA common question\n\nWhy does the dataLayer.push NOT expand when clicked?\n\nThis is usually due to the console filter either having something other than a tilde (~) or when the levels are too strict.\n\nRemedy: Use the tilde (~) for a filter and select \"Default levels\".\n\nKnown issue\n\nConsole output\n\nIncomplete output when DevTools is opened\n\nOn some sites, when you open the console, the output is incomplete. Refresh the page to see the complete output.",

Here’s a quick recap of the story.\n\nThe Story\n\nFull-service advertising and marketing firm Love Communications works across an extensive range of industries and markets, so it uses Facebook Ads for several clients—more than 30 at any given time.\n\nUtilizing Adswerve’s Data Transfer App with the Facebook Ads Connector they were able to transfer Facebook Ads data into BigQuery and then integrate it with other datasets like Google Analytics. Love Communications had full ownership and control of the data transfers, including the ability to stop and start transfers at any time.

      "# [Results | Six Flags | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/six-flags)\nEntertainment giant Six Flags operates theme parks and attractions throughout North America. Their marketing team relies heavily on data from its web, app and sales platforms to monitor sales and marketing metrics and make informed decisions about park operations and guest experiences.\n\nSix Flags partnered with Google Cloud and Adswerve for a marketing analytics workshop to help identify untapped opportunities in their data. Through that process, the teams pinpointed an initiative to explore expanding Six Flags’ existing social sentiment initiative.\n\nTheir legacy sentiment tool was limited to providing a high-level brand score and couldn’t connect to Reddit, which was a big ask from senior leadership. Both the marketing team and the C-suite wanted the ability to go deeper to create and monitor scores by park location and key categories so they could better understand what products and experiences visitors enjoy — and uncover friction points they need to act on.\n\nUltimately, the Six Flags marketing team wanted to understand their guests’ perceptions of the brand, parks and customer experience to see what works and what doesn’t — and easily share the findings with the C-suite for visibility, investigation and quick action.\n\nAdswerve got to work, diving into Six Flags' robust social sentiment solution needs. The team uncovered that Six Flags wanted to monitor sentiment in five core categories: entertainment, food & beverage, price, cleanliness, wait times and customer experience for each of its 27 parks across five social platforms: Google Reviews, Trip Advisor, Instagram, Facebook and Reddit. Because Six Flags operates parks in Canada and Mexico, they also needed the ability to translate French and Spanish social posts into English.\n\nAfter thoroughly investigating Six Flags' solution requirements, we began building a new, more robust social sentiment tool. We used Apify to connect the five social sources in Google Cloud Platform’s data warehouse, BigQuery, reducing the need for custom API development and shortening implementation time.\n\nOnce we connected the data, our data engineers leveraged the full power of Google Cloud to automate data pulls, transform data (including translating other languages into English), assign sentiment scores and categories, create trend summaries using generative AI and push the synthesized information to Looker in real time. It all happens from one platform with one SQL query.\n\nSix Flags can now view and share a Looker dashboard that includes overall and park-specific sentiment scores and uses generative AI to surface the top five positive and negative trends in a \"week in review\" summary. They can easily see performance and insights — and the social comments driving them — and monitor them over time.\n\nThe power of this data was realized shortly into the project while the dashboard was still in development. A park approached marketing to update its highly trafficked park homepage, theorizing visitors were unhappy with recent maintenance impacting ride availability. Six Flags marketing was able to quickly validate the topic was trending for the park in the initial data sets and move forward confidently with the site update to better set expectations for visitors. And while seasonality and completed maintenance both play a part, the park has seen fewer negative posts and its customer experience sentiment score climb month-over-month since implementing the change.\n\nToday, Six Flags can easily view and understand overall customer sentiment and drill in by park across the five main performance categories in their Looker dashboard to uncover additional opportunities to improve the customer experience. If sentiment drops in a particular park in a specific category over time, they can explore the reasons and quickly remedy them. Similarly, they can identify why sudden dips or spikes are happening and quantify how critical an issue is by how many people are discussing it. The Six Flags marketing team can also see the immediate impact price changes, new or updated rides, events, seasonality and more have on sentiment in the short and long term, and make appropriate changes to their digital marketing programs, park operations and more.\n\nBeyond providing powerful insights, the new solution saves Six Flags time. What used to be a manual process, taking 15 people two to three hours per week each, is now fully automated, incorporates the latest AI technology and is easily shareable with organization stakeholders.\n\nUp next? Six Flags is entering their busy events season and plans to use the new social sentiment tool to see how national events stack up against park-specific ones. They’ll incorporate their learning into their future events strategy. The team also plans to add X (formerly Twitter) to their selected social platform sources.",
      "# [Results | FTD | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/ftd)\nLeading online floral retailer FTD has multiple customer touchpoints across radio, linear, connected TV (CTV), social, search engine marketing (SEM) and programmatic display channels. Ultimately, FTD wants to reach its target audiences and deepen relationships with them in their preferred channels in the most cost-effective and efficient way possible. To accomplish this, they need access to the insights through an intuitive, prescriptive interface.\n\nAs one of the most trusted online floral retailers in the world, FTD took an industry-leading approach to prepare for a cookieless future. The company used advanced data engineering techniques to consolidate their data into Google Cloud and BigQuery. From there, FTD prioritized building a new privacy-centric attribution model that could allow its marketing team to determine the most effective media mix. For this, they turned to Adswerve to help build a modeling solution that will meet today’s (and tomorrow’s) privacy standards, understand its customers' preferences, and see how to optimally allocate its marketing budget across its many online and offline touchpoints.\n\nUsing Google Cloud technology, Adswerve data scientists built a multifaceted, durable modeling solution to determine which media touchpoints will impact FTD’s revenue the most.\n\nThe FTD data estate is in an advanced state which made it easy for Adswerve to review and validate FTD's Google Analytics dataset and then create, train and optimize a model using Python to help FTD understand how its media spend affects sales and to learn more about its spend allocation across media.\n\nAdswerve’s data scientists also used machine learning (ML) to predict which channels will reach select audiences and allow the FTD team to target its messaging to the right customers at the right times without oversaturation.\n\nOnce the model was up and running, the Adswerve team developed channel attribution, adstock effects, and diminishing returns visualizations for the FTD team to see the insights the model gleaned from the data.\n\nFinally, Adswerve developed a proprietary budget tool that offers FTD weekly model-derived insights with recommended budget allocation. The easy-to-use app is available to FTD’s entire marketing organization and secured using Google Cloud.\n\nWith off-the-shelf MMM products, you can’t see how the models work or customize them, and they often take an enormous amount of time and effort to implement. But using Google Cloud gave Adswerve the power, speed and flexibility to tailor models to FTD’s needs seamlessly.\n\nAbout Mixed Media Models\n\nWith a mixed-media model, you can:\n\nSee how each media channel impacts your target KPIs\n\nUnderstand how media channels perform with a change in spend\n\nEstimate the optimal budget allocation across your media channels\n\nPlus, see how much additional spend will improve channel performance and how long-lasting the effects will be.\n\nAdswerve’s Google Cloud modeling solution delivered value right from the start. When it first tested the modeling solution, FTD determined its television campaign spend wasn’t optimal. Since then, the marketing team has reduced its TV campaign budget by 30% while still reaching the same audience. They were able to reallocate the savings into other channels that had more opportunity to grow.\n\nMoving forward, this new durable technology will drive FTD’s data-informed decisions about media purchasing. Every member of its marketing organization can easily access and seamlessly use Google Cloud’s machine learning models and insights using Adswerve’s app to make quick, revenue-boosting media decisions."
