      "# [Results | World Surf League | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/wsl)\nWorld Surf League (WSL) is a digital-first sports league by design because no one knows exactly when the wave conditions will be right. They plan events around a two-week time window at locations around the globe. When the surf is up, the competition begins. Being all-digital allows WSL to publish content fast and stream surfing events as they occur. Fans can use a mobile app to watch live broadcasts and keep up to date with their favorite WSL athletes anywhere, anytime.\n\nAfter consolidating several live events from major surfing brands onto its own video streaming platform, WSL needed better answers to questions about viewership. How many fans engage regularly? How many tune in to multiple events? Who are the superfans — the ones who drive the majority of consumption and engagement— and which new users are most likely to become superfans?\n\nTo better understand fan behavior, WSL began using Google Analytics 360 to gather data from a variety of customer touchpoints and worked with us to accelerate time to value and keep data quality high.\n\nWe combined and cleaned data from Analytics 360, Facebook and WSL’s internal system into a single data lake and modeled superfan attributes using machine learning algorithms. We then applied early engagement attributes of superfans so WSL could focus its marketing on new users.\n\nThe fan insights WSL gained using Google Analytics 360 with Google BigQuery allowed the organization to reduce cost per conversion by more than 50%, which more than doubled the efficiency of ad spend aimed at driving fan engagement and content viewership.\n\nBy focusing on higher ROI customers, WSL drives greater fan engagement with live events and digital content—without increasing its marketing budget. When weather conditions deliver the best waves and large numbers of fans are looking at content, WSL can easily scale its analytics on demand. And during the offseason, it can scale down, which has allowed it to reduce infrastructure costs by 70%.\n\nNow its team can ask more sophisticated questions of its data: How do wave conditions affect viewership? How do athletes’ scores correlate with other factors such as wave height, time of day, or level of competition? And what exactly is a superfan worth to the business?\n\nDownload the full case study.",

      "# [Gannet Case Study by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/gannett)\nGannett, one of the largest publishers of locally based print and digital media in the United States, partnered with Adswerve to better understand audience behavior and identify opportunities to drive memberships and decrease churn. Because membership numbers remain a critical revenue component for media companies, Gannett had three primary goals:\n\nIncrease digital memberships using propensity scoring\n\nIdentify users at risk of unsubscribing and target with interventions to retain them\n\nBuild a recommendation engine to determine the best content to drive action\n\nThe publisher wanted to employ BigQuery as their marketing data warehouse to power machine learning insights and interventions. They also needed to go beyond summary aggregates and use machine learning processing for more detailed analysis.\n\nGannett came to us with the idea of building scoring models to inform what they needed to meet their goals. Armed with this information, Gannett would be able to intercept users with relevant content or actions to increase memberships and retention.\n\nWe collaborated with the strategic development team, headed by VP of Digital Operations and Product Development Chris Biondi, to bring this project to fruition. The project team, led by Director of Corporate Consumer Data Strategy Rich Forsgren, relied on Adswerve team members to help shape and refine the strategy. We approached the initiative with five workstreams: Data Preparation and Exploratory Data Analysis, Propensity Modeling, Churn Modeling, Content Recommendations and Intervention Identification.\n\nNow that the modeling and workflows are set up, Gannett can:\n\nUse propensity scoring to increase digital subscriptions\n\nRetain users at risk of unsubscribing\n\nCreate compelling, targeted content that converts\n\nThe team has a solid foundation for other activities, too, including building and leveraging audiences across the Google Marketing Platform, surfacing new reporting dimensions, and building more real-time scoring to dynamically alter user experiences and develop new content personalization offerings\n\nThe project continues to evolve as the team reviews results.",
      "# [Results | FTD | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/ftd)\nLeading online floral retailer FTD has multiple customer touchpoints across radio, linear, connected TV (CTV), social, search engine marketing (SEM) and programmatic display channels. Ultimately, FTD wants to reach its target audiences and deepen relationships with them in their preferred channels in the most cost-effective and efficient way possible. To accomplish this, they need access to the insights through an intuitive, prescriptive interface.\n\nAs one of the most trusted online floral retailers in the world, FTD took an industry-leading approach to prepare for a cookieless future. The company used advanced data engineering techniques to consolidate their data into Google Cloud and BigQuery. From there, FTD prioritized building a new privacy-centric attribution model that could allow its marketing team to determine the most effective media mix. For this, they turned to Adswerve to help build a modeling solution that will meet today’s (and tomorrow’s) privacy standards, understand its customers' preferences, and see how to optimally allocate its marketing budget across its many online and offline touchpoints.\n\nUsing Google Cloud technology, Adswerve data scientists built a multifaceted, durable modeling solution to determine which media touchpoints will impact FTD’s revenue the most.\n\nThe FTD data estate is in an advanced state which made it easy for Adswerve to review and validate FTD's Google Analytics dataset and then create, train and optimize a model using Python to help FTD understand how its media spend affects sales and to learn more about its spend allocation across media.\n\nAdswerve’s data scientists also used machine learning (ML) to predict which channels will reach select audiences and allow the FTD team to target its messaging to the right customers at the right times without oversaturation.\n\nOnce the model was up and running, the Adswerve team developed channel attribution, adstock effects, and diminishing returns visualizations for the FTD team to see the insights the model gleaned from the data.\n\nFinally, Adswerve developed a proprietary budget tool that offers FTD weekly model-derived insights with recommended budget allocation. The easy-to-use app is available to FTD’s entire marketing organization and secured using Google Cloud.\n\nWith off-the-shelf MMM products, you can’t see how the models work or customize them, and they often take an enormous amount of time and effort to implement. But using Google Cloud gave Adswerve the power, speed and flexibility to tailor models to FTD’s needs seamlessly.\n\nAbout Mixed Media Models\n\nWith a mixed-media model, you can:\n\nSee how each media channel impacts your target KPIs\n\nUnderstand how media channels perform with a change in spend\n\nEstimate the optimal budget allocation across your media channels\n\nPlus, see how much additional spend will improve channel performance and how long-lasting the effects will be.\n\nAdswerve’s Google Cloud modeling solution delivered value right from the start. When it first tested the modeling solution, FTD determined its television campaign spend wasn’t optimal. Since then, the marketing team has reduced its TV campaign budget by 30% while still reaching the same audience. They were able to reallocate the savings into other channels that had more opportunity to grow.\n\nMoving forward, this new durable technology will drive FTD’s data-informed decisions about media purchasing. Every member of its marketing organization can easily access and seamlessly use Google Cloud’s machine learning models and insights using Adswerve’s app to make quick, revenue-boosting media decisions.",

      "# [Ovative Group Case Study by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/ovative-group)\nAdswerve client Ovative Group is the agency of record for online meat delivery service Crowd Cow. Tasked with managing Crowd Cow’s paid search and shopping campaigns, Ovative needed to generate new customer orders with a CPA lower than their average.\n\nOvative knew email registrations were a valuable component of driving new customer acquisition and it wanted to try using new weighted formulas, taking into account email registrations, new customer orders and subscriptions to understand how the right combination could drive additional new customer volume at the same — or lower — CPA.\n\nOvative turned to us to help them dive into Google Search Ads 360 and develop unique column formulas by ad tactics and bid strategies based on campaign-driven values. Working closely, our teams set up and solved issues in order to ensure all the formulas were properly weighted and working seamlessly.\n\nIn the six weeks after implementing the formulas and new bid strategies, the teams generated a 108% increase in conversions in six weeks on an 86% increase in spend and lowered CPA by 9%.",
      "# [Results | Alaska Airlines | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/alaska-airlines)\nAs the fifth-largest airline in the United States, Alaska Airlines collects many first-party data points across different repositories. The company turned to us when it needed to bring it all together and securely house it in one location while streamlining processes.\n\nWe built a marketing data warehouse using BigQuery in Google Cloud, which tied Alaska’s first-party data together across CRM, media and site analytics. Next, we created predictive lifetime value (pLTV) models using Google Cloud AutoML. Then we fed the predictive scores into the Campaign Manager Conversions API. This connection enabled us to use that data in Search Ads 360 and set up an Auction Time Bid Strategy to quickly, predictively and programmatically bid to pLTV.\n\nAlong the way, we uncovered some interesting insights about the values tied to customers’ origin and destination (O&D) airports, travel days, ages, loyalty program membership and more.\n\nUsing the advanced infrastructure and modeling has helped Alaska achieve a higher ROAS. In fact, activating the information across its Google platforms led to a 30% increase in ROAS for O&D campaigns and helped the company earn $1 more per paid search click.",

      "# [Campaign Trafficking Guide on 2018-08-17](https://staging.adswerve.com/trafficking-guide/)\nCampaign Hierarchy Explained\n\nThe Campaign Manager 360 platform consists of a stack of hierarchical levels with the Advertiser sitting on top. An Advertiser can have many Campaigns to represent different strategies. At the Campaign level, your goal is to traffick your media plan to generate Placement Tags to provide to your Publishers who will deliver your ad inventory. The objects included within a Campaign are defined below and are listed in the order that they appear in the Campaign hierarchy.\n\nSites are the websites, networks or mobile apps where ad inventory has been purchased from and can have many Placements assigned to it.\n\nPlacements represent the ad slots that have been purchased with a media buy and can have many Ads assigned to it.\n\nCreatives are the art or creative assets that will be shown to users when an Ad is served. Creative can be shared across Campaigns and assigned to many Ads.\n\nAds serve as a bridge between Placements and Creative and control how or when Creative is served. Ads can have multiple creative versions assigned to it and can be assigned to multiple Placements across different Sites.\n\nTrafficking Workflow\n\nWe recommend to traffick your Campaign following the described workflow to help you stay organized. However, once the process and hierarchy become more familiar, the workflow may be modified to fit the best process for your team.\n\nStep 1: Create a Campaign\n\nCreate the shell of your Campaign that you would like to create under your Advertiser. Each Campaign can have different Placements and Ads for your marketing strategy. The properties define your run dates and can control other default settings to apply to your Campaign.\n\nSelect Campaigns from the navigation bar at the top of CM360.\n\nClick on the New button.\n\nEnter the name for the Campaign.\n\nAssign the Campaign to an Advertiser.\n\nEnter the Campaign Start and End Dates.\n\nCreate a Default Landing Page URL.\n\nClick Save.\n\nStep 2: Create Placements\n\nThe purpose of creating Placements is to represent what was purchased within your media buy. For each Placement that is created, CM360 will generate a code snippet or Placement tag to provide to your Publishers for implementation.\n\nClick on the New button and select Placement.\n\nSelect Current account or Site Directory to access the list of Sites.\n\nSearch and select the Publisher Site from step 2.\n\nEnter a name for the Placement. The name should represent what was purchased within your media buy.\n\nSet all required Placement property settings.\n\nClick Save.\n\nStep 3: Upload Creative\n\nWhen you upload Creative at the Campaign level, it will automatically be added to the Creatives tab at the Advertiser level which allows it to be shared across other Campaigns. We recommend uploading Creatives at the Campaign level using the Batch upload option described below. However, if you need to add existing Creative from your Advertiser to your Campaign, you may use the Add from Advertiser option instead. Learn more about options to upload Creative.\n\nClick on the New button and select Batch upload.\n\nSelect Creative Assets if you have creative files to upload into CM360. You can also choose to batch upload third-party asset URLs.\n\nSelect files to upload.\n\nYou can select multiple files or a .zip file of all your assets. When uploading HTML5 creative, you will be required to upload a .zip file and a backup static image to associate with it.\n\nClick Next.\n\nIf you are uploading a static image of a particular size for the first time, CM360 will prompt you to select Default creative to generate Default Ads. Default Ads are system Ads that can serve if there are no other eligible Ads available. It is recommended to use brand-neutral creative for your Default Creative.\n\nClick Next and Save.\n\nStep 4: Create Ads\n\nAds function as the bridge between your Placements and Creative and control when your creative is served. Create at least 1 Standard Ad for each Placement for CM360 to serve. Learn more about all available Ad types.\n\nClick New and Standard.\n\nEnter a name for the Ad. The naming convention should help you identify the Ad in reporting.\n\nSet the Ad Status to Active.\n\nEnter the Ad Start and End Dates to indicate when the Ad is eligible to serve. It is recommended to set the Ad Start date to the current date to allow for testing.\n\nSet any other desired Ad Delivery properties (optional).\n\nExpand the Creative assignments section and click Edit creative assignments.\n\nSelect the Creative(s) you would like to serve/rotate.\n\nScroll to the right of the Creative name to select or set landing page.\n\nExpand the Placement assignments section and click Edit placement assignments.\n\nSelect the Placement(s) you would like the Ad to serve to.\n\nClick Save.\n\nStep 5: Download tags\n\nExport the relevant Placement Tags to provide to your Publishers for implementation. Export all available tag types to allow your Publishers to select an acceptable tag type.\n\nClick Tags and select Download tags.\n\nSelect Excel as the Format (recommended).\n\nClick Download.\n\nStep 6: Verify Impressions (recommended)\n\nAfter Placement tags have been implemented or tested, we strongly recommend monitoring performance data 24 hours after a Campaign has gone live by viewing reports from Reporting.\n\nHelpful Resources\n\nTo access the Campaign Manager 360 Help Center, please click here.\n\nFor additional training on Campaign Manager 360, please access self-paced modules and certification via the Skillshop.\n\nStay on top of the latest updates by subscribing to the Google Marketing Platform Blog.",

      "# [Results | Six Flags | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/six-flags)\nEntertainment giant Six Flags operates theme parks and attractions throughout North America. Their marketing team relies heavily on data from its web, app and sales platforms to monitor sales and marketing metrics and make informed decisions about park operations and guest experiences.\n\nSix Flags partnered with Google Cloud and Adswerve for a marketing analytics workshop to help identify untapped opportunities in their data. Through that process, the teams pinpointed an initiative to explore expanding Six Flags’ existing social sentiment initiative.\n\nTheir legacy sentiment tool was limited to providing a high-level brand score and couldn’t connect to Reddit, which was a big ask from senior leadership. Both the marketing team and the C-suite wanted the ability to go deeper to create and monitor scores by park location and key categories so they could better understand what products and experiences visitors enjoy — and uncover friction points they need to act on.\n\nUltimately, the Six Flags marketing team wanted to understand their guests’ perceptions of the brand, parks and customer experience to see what works and what doesn’t — and easily share the findings with the C-suite for visibility, investigation and quick action.\n\nAdswerve got to work, diving into Six Flags' robust social sentiment solution needs. The team uncovered that Six Flags wanted to monitor sentiment in five core categories: entertainment, food & beverage, price, cleanliness, wait times and customer experience for each of its 27 parks across five social platforms: Google Reviews, Trip Advisor, Instagram, Facebook and Reddit. Because Six Flags operates parks in Canada and Mexico, they also needed the ability to translate French and Spanish social posts into English.\n\nAfter thoroughly investigating Six Flags' solution requirements, we began building a new, more robust social sentiment tool. We used Amplify to connect the five social sources in Google Cloud Platform’s data warehouse, BigQuery, reducing the need for custom API development and shortening implementation time.\n\nOnce we connected the data, our data engineers leveraged the full power of Google Cloud to automate data pulls, transform data (including translating other languages into English), assign sentiment scores and categories, create trend summaries using generative AI and push the synthesized information to Looker in real time. It all happens from one platform with one SQL query.\n\nSix Flags can now view and share a Looker dashboard that includes overall and park-specific sentiment scores and uses generative AI to surface the top five positive and negative trends in a \"week in review\" summary. They can easily see performance and insights — and the social comments driving them — and monitor them over time.\n\nThe power of this data was realized shortly into the project while the dashboard was still in development. A park approached marketing to update its highly trafficked park homepage, theorizing visitors were unhappy with recent maintenance impacting ride availability. Six Flags marketing was able to quickly validate the topic was trending for the park in the initial data sets and move forward confidently with the site update to better set expectations for visitors. And while seasonality and completed maintenance both play a part, the park has seen fewer negative posts and its customer experience sentiment score climb month-over-month since implementing the change.\n\nToday, Six Flags can easily view and understand overall customer sentiment and drill in by park across the five main performance categories in their Looker dashboard to uncover additional opportunities to improve the customer experience. If sentiment drops in a particular park in a specific category over time, they can explore the reasons and quickly remedy them. Similarly, they can identify why sudden dips or spikes are happening and quantify how critical an issue is by how many people are discussing it. The Six Flags marketing team can also see the immediate impact price changes, new or updated rides, events, seasonality and more have on sentiment in the short and long term, and make appropriate changes to their digital marketing programs, park operations and more.\n\nBeyond providing powerful insights, the new solution saves Six Flags time. What used to be a manual process, taking 15 people two to three hours per week each, is now fully automated, incorporates the latest AI technology and is easily shareable with organization stakeholders.\n\nUp next? Six Flags is entering their busy events season and plans to use the new social sentiment tool to see how national events stack up against park-specific ones. They’ll incorporate their learning into their future events strategy. The team also plans to add X (formerly Twitter) to their selected social platform sources.",
      "# [Case Study - Cedars Sinai by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/cedars-sinai)\nLeveraging Adobe Customer Journey Analytics to Create a Long-Term, Privacy-Safe, Foundation for Omnichannel Analytics and Personalization for Cedars-Sinai\n\nProblem\n\nLeading healthcare organization Cedars-Sinai strives to be at the forefront of care and deliver an exceptional patient experience. This extends to its digital experience and the Cedar’s Consumer Digital Innovation (CDI) team's efforts to advance and innovate its analytics and personalization strategy — a daunting challenge in healthcare due to complex patient privacy requirements.\n\nTo gain deeper insights into patient interactions across various channels, Cedars-Sinai's CDI team sought a modern analytics platform that extends beyond basic product and funnel analytics. They needed a solution that could map consumer and patient journeys across channels and identify specific user segments requiring actionable engagement. Viewing this as a strategic opportunity, the CDI team aimed to find a long-term solution that not only adheres to Cedars-Sinai’s stringent patient privacy requirements but also advances the organization's goal of delivering large-scale, compliant, omnichannel personalization for patients and users.\n\nTo develop this modern analytics infrastructure based on consistent tracking and accurate, HIPAA-compliant data collection across the patient journey, the CDI team selected Adobe’s Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) to replace Adobe Analytics.\n\nWith the platform selected, Cedars-Sinai needed a partner to help implement CJA properly and create consistency across several disparate web properties and mobile applications (website domains, email, MyChart and virtual care, and offline touchpoints, like call centers) and lay the foundation for its long-term omnichannel personalization strategy.\n\n\"We always aimed to transition to a more advanced analytics platform like CJA to bridge the gap between channels, gain better consumer insights, and deliver a more personalized experience while ensuring HIPAA compliance. With Adswerve’s deep expertise in analytics and technology, we’ve had a partner solely focused on delivering that value and helping us keep moving forward.\"\n\nTara Konar\n\nDirector, Technology Development\n\nCedars-Sinai\n\n\"I wanted to leverage the CJA project to develop an analytics strategy that we can really hone in on moving forward. Previously, our attribution strategy was often tied to a project's immediate needs, causing fragmented results in our tracking. Our conversations with Adswerve helped us validate our realizations, gain external feedback and insights to develop and evolve a new tracking strategy and architecture for the future.\"\n\nRyan Achzet\n\nManager, Technology Development\n\nCedars-Sinai\n\nSolution\n\nConsulting with Adobe led the CDI team to connect with potential implementation partners. The team ultimately selected Adswerve to advise on and implement CJA because of the consultancy’s expertise and experience. From the initial conversation to the seamless discovery and scoping process, it was clear that Adswerve could help the CDI team not only implement CJA but also collaborate on the strategic foundation it needed for its long-term plans. Once Adswerve was on board, the teams collaborated to develop and execute a multi-phase implementation plan.\n\nIn phase one, Adswerve served as both a technical and strategic partner to the CDI team. Adswerve completed the initial CJA implementation to connect Cedars-Sinai’s primary domain, five sub-domains and iOS and Android apps, and deliver new insights into the patient journey across their web and app assets.\n\nAdswerve also collaborated to set the foundations for a new data governance strategy at Cedars-Sinai, helping them evolve from disparate systems and tracking approaches to a more holistic strategy. The strategic framework and new tracking documentation were key to implementing CJA to be scalable, consistent and HIPAA-compliant across the organization's tools and teams for years to come. The Adswerve team also helped align workstreams as the CDI team worked in tandem to implement the Adobe Client Data Layer internally.\n\nWith CJA implemented and currently in beta, the CDI team plans to make it the organization’s analytics platform of record in mid-2024. Adswerve will continue partnering with the CDI team to ensure Cedars-Sinai can fully leverage the new tools and insights from phase one as it expands CJA to connect additional domains, the MyChart patient portal and offline sources.\n\n\"We approached the project as a technical team, thinking of it as an implementation engagement, not a strategy-level engagement. But then we saw that the Adswerve team was on it, talking about every specific point and guiding us to discover new things that we hadn't even thought about. That was big for us.\"\n\nTara Konar\n\nDirector, Technology Development\n\nCedars-Sinai\n\n\"I’ve had a really good experience with Adswerve. There is a level of collaboration that does not exist elsewhere that I've really enjoyed. Their dialogue helps us guide our team to arrive at the best solution for Cedars.\"\n\nRyan Achzet\n\nManager, Technology Development\n\nCedars-Sinai\n\n2\n\nWork Streams\n\nMoving in Tandem\n\n1\n\nImplementation\n\nPhase Completed\n\n8\n\nDomains & Apps Integrated\n\n100%\n\nconfidence in\n\nHIPaA COMPLIANce\n\nResults\n\nHaving CJA properly implemented and updated data governance underway allows Cedars-Sinai to collect accurate data across its many web and mobile assets on its journey to full omnichannel analytics and personalization. Cedars can now leverage its data to glean new insights about the user journey — especially between mobile and web — to help it better segment audiences, create more personalized marketing campaigns for patients and guests, and have clearer visibility into performance. And the organization can evolve and mature its tech stack by layering additional tools and technologies on top of CJA, like Adobe Journey Optimizer, which will further its goal to be a leader in delivering scalable, omnichannel, personalized customer experiences.\n\n\"With the strategy and underlying work in place in partnership with Adswerve, we’re in a position to improve reporting and push towards personalization. It sets us up for the next three to five years to easily bring on new tools and leverage CJA capabilities vs. starting from ground zero with each new integration.\"\n\nRyan Achzet\n\nManager, Technology Development\n\nCedars-Sinai\n\n\"I’m excited to leverage CJA to provide deeper insights into the overall patient journey to the organization, which is a very new concept at Cedars, and move forward on our journey of personalization while balancing our requirements around compliance. The deep analytics and technology expertise brought by Adswerve have helped get us to this point, and now we’re in a position to continue innovating and improving.\"\n\nTara Konar\n\nDirector, Technology Development\n\nCedars-Sinai\n\nAll case studies\n\nHave a similar project you'd\n\nlike to talk about?",

      "# [YOUR GUIDE TO TRAFFICKING IN CAMPAIGN MANAGER 360 by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/cm-trafficking-guide)\nBefore beginning to traffick your Campaign, it is important to understand the Campaign hierarchy to help you traffick efficiently to stay organized and save you time!\n\nCAMPAIGN HIERARCHY EXPLAINED\n\nThe Campaign Manager 360 platform consists of a stack of hierarchical levels with the Advertiser sitting on top. An Advertiser can have many Campaigns to represent different strategies. At the Campaign level, your goal is to traffick your media plan to generate Placement Tags to provide to your Publishers who will deliver your ad inventory. The objects included within a Campaign are defined below and are listed in the order that they appear in the Campaign hierarchy.\n\nSites are the websites, networks or mobile apps where ad inventory has been purchased from and can have many Placements assigned to it.\n\nPlacements represent the ad slots that have been purchased with a media buy and can have many Ads assigned to it.\n\nCreatives are the art or creative assets that will be shown to users when an Ad is served. Creative can be shared across Campaigns and assigned to many Ads.\n\nAds serve as a bridge between Placements and Creative and control how or when Creative is served. Ads can have multiple creative versions assigned to it and can be assigned to multiple Placements across different Sites.\n\nTRAFFICKING WORKFLOW\n\nWe recommend to traffick your Campaign following the described workflow to help you stay organized. However, once the process and hierarchy become more familiar, the workflow may be modified to fit the best process for your team.\n\nSTEP 1: CREATE A CAMPAIGN\n\nCreate the shell of your Campaign that you would like to create under your Advertiser. Each Campaign can have different Placements and Ads for your marketing strategy. The properties define your run dates and can control other default settings to apply to your Campaign.\n\nSelect Campaigns from the navigation bar at the top of CM360.\n\nClick on the New button.\n\nEnter the name for the Campaign.\n\nAssign the Campaign to an Advertiser.\n\nEnter the Campaign Start and End Dates.\n\nCreate a Default Landing Page URL.\n\nClick Save.\n\nSTEP 2: CREATE PLACEMENTS\n\nThe purpose of creating Placements is to represent what was purchased within your media buy. For each Placement that is created, CM360 will generate a code snippet or Placement tag to provide to your Publishers for implementation.\n\nClick on the New button and select Placement.\n\nSelect Current account or Site Directory to access the list of Sites.\n\nSearch and select the Publisher Site from step 2.\n\nEnter a name for the Placement. The name should represent what was purchased within your media buy.\n\nSet all required Placement property settings.\n\nClick Save.\n\nSTEP 3: UPLOAD CREATIVE\n\nWhen you upload Creative at the Campaign level, it will automatically be added to the Creatives tab at the Advertiser level which allows it to be shared across other Campaigns. We recommend uploading Creatives at the Campaign level using the Batch upload option described below. However, if you need to add existing Creative from your Advertiser to your Campaign, you may use the Add from Advertiser option instead. Learn more about options to upload Creative.\n\nClick on the New button and select Batch upload.\n\nSelect Creative Assets if you have creative files to upload into CM360. You can also choose to batch upload third-party asset URLs.\n\nSelect files to upload.\n\nYou can select multiple files or a .zip file of all your assets. When uploading HTML5 creative, you will be required to upload a .zip file and a backup static image to associate with it.\n\nClick Next.\n\nIf you are uploading a static image of a particular size for the first time, CM360 will prompt you to select Default creative to generate Default Ads. Default Ads are system Ads that can serve if there are no other eligible Ads available. It is recommended to use brand-neutral creative for your Default Creative.\n\nClick Next and Save.\n\nSTEP 4: CREATE ADS\n\nAds function as the bridge between your Placements and Creative and control when your creative is served. Create at least 1 Standard Ad for each Placement for CM360 to serve. Learn more about all available Ad types.\n\nClick New and Standard.\n\nEnter a name for the Ad. The naming convention should help you identify the Ad in reporting.\n\nSet the Ad Status to Active.\n\nEnter the Ad Start and End Dates to indicate when the Ad is eligible to serve. It is recommended to set the Ad Start date to the current date to allow for testing.\n\nSet any other desired Ad Delivery properties (optional).\n\nExpand the Creative assignments section and click Edit creative assignments.\n\nSelect the Creative(s) you would like to serve/rotate.\n\nScroll to the right of the Creative name to select or set landing page.\n\nExpand the Placement assignments section and click Edit placement assignments.\n\nSelect the Placement(s) you would like the Ad to serve to.\n\nClick Save.\n\nSTEP 5: DOWNLOAD TAGS\n\nExport the relevant Placement Tags to provide to your Publishers for implementation. Export all available tag types to allow your Publishers to select an acceptable tag type.\n\nClick Tags and select Download tags.\n\nSelect Excel as the Format (recommended).\n\nClick Download.\n\nSTEP 6: VERIFY IMPRESSIONS (RECOMMENDED)\n\nAfter Placement tags have been implemented or tested, we strongly recommend monitoring performance data 24 hours after a Campaign has gone live by viewing reports from Reporting.\n\nHELPFUL RESOURCES\n\nTo access the Campaign Manager 360 Help Center, please click here.\n\nFor additional training on Campaign Manager 360, please access self-paced modules and certification via the Skillshop.\n\nStay on top of the latest updates by subscribing to the Google Marketing Platform Blog.\n\nFor additional questions, please contact us via support@adswerve.com.",
      "# [Urchin Retirement Party by Caleb Whitmore on 2012-01-22](https://adswerve.com/blog/urchin-retirement)\nOn January 20th Google announced it will be ceasing any new development for the Urchin Software product line and ending new purchases or upgrades after March 28th, 2012. So, what better thing to do than throw a retirement party for Urchin! It seemed fitting to us. In this post I've reviewed our take on what this means and what you should (or shouldn't) do about it. Enjoy, and don't forget to have a slice of cake before leaving.\n\nWhat Does the Retirement of Urchin Really Mean?\n\nThe team here at Analytics Pros was surprised by this announcement like you may be. But let's face it, Urchin has been around a long time, been a pioneer in the web analytics industry, and it's offspring has become arguably the most used web analytics platform on the planet. Not a bad record, eh? That said, the Google notice and the FAQ on the Urchin website leave a bit to be explained. While I can't speak for Google, I will try to clarify our understanding of Google's decision and its impact on you. First, I see three primary user groups this announcement impacts:\n\nCurrent Urchin 7.x license owners. Read more here.\n\nOwners of licenses to previous Urchin versions (5.x, 6.x). Read more here.\n\nProspective buyers of Urchin. Read more here.\n\nThe announcement of Urchin's end-of-life by Google is sure to impact each of these groups differently. As resellers, it impacts us too as we use the software ourselves and support hundreds who use it worldwide. Second, I'm thankful to hear a certain plan for Urchin's future, although dismayed it is one leading to discontinuation. Since Google acquired Urchin Software back in 2005 there has been much speculation about the future of Urchin Software products. Speculation was abruptly stopped when version 6 of Urchin was released in 2008. With version 7 coming out in 2010 it looked like Urchin Software was on a slow but forward-moving path. Google's announcement clarifies that path is ending with no new updates and no new sales after March 28th of 2012. Third, I know you'll have questions, want answers, and need to make a plan to deal with this news. We're here to help. We may not have answers for every question, but we're happy to hear your questions and concerns and respond as best we can. If you're our customer having purchased Urchin from us, we are continuing to support the product as long as we have customers running it and will continue to provide training for those wishing to receive it. Additionally, we're beginning work on ways to better support continuation or Urchin operations using our Urchin Hosting service as well as development of a means for supporting automated data extraction and permanent archival using Urchin 7's fantastic data export API.\n\nSo, What are Your Options with Urchin?\n\nDepending on which of the three groups above that you fall into, here are my thoughts and recommendations on your options from here forward.\n\nCurrent 7.x Owners\n\nIf are owner of a 7.x version of Urchin Software, here's what I think about how Google's announcement might impact you and what you should do about it.\n\nGood news with bad - version 7 just got an upgrade to 7.2 with many bug fixes! The bad news is that this is the last update the software will receive.\n\nWhile Google is \"discontinuing\" the Urchin product line, that doesn't mean Urchin dead. Urchin Software is lightweight and doesn't require much to keep running smoothly, so you're not going to just lose your software investment or data overnight. We have some customers still running Urchin versions 5 and 6, and have even seen an ancient version 3 or 4 installation from time to time. Keep your installation server well-maintained, move to a stable platform before the March 28th sales-cutoff, or migrate to our cloud-based solution, and your Urchin server can continue to run happily for years to come.\n\nThe biggest threat to running Urchin forever is the pace of OS change and a changing security landscape. For organizations that run Urchin entirely within their networks (no outside access), keeping an older OS around for years to come is viable (albeit perhaps annoying). If you must expose Urchin to the web, separating it from your network provides some insulation from security threats that might arise. Urchin 5 (circa 2004) still runs in many places (many large web hosts included), so the planning horizon for retiring Urchin probably doesn't need to be critical.\n\nThat said, as your planning and budgeting cycles allow, begin working on a migration plan for your web analytics needs. Google Analytics (standard or premium) may be good option. I've seen many of our customers already using GA while still running Urchin. Talk to your stakeholders and data users to explore whether or not this is a viable route. If not, or if you want/need to continue to analyze server logfiles, then you'll need to evaluate other software options. Our team has begun a search for comparable solutions in the software-based analytics space, so stay tuned to our blog and Twitter feed for updates on this.\n\nFor organizations with significant investments in customization and integration of Urchin we understand the news of Urchin's retirement may be harder to take in. I encourage you not to give up - as noted above, Urchin is resilient and will continue to run happily just as it does now for years to come. It's still the same software you purchased and use and will continue to operate in its current state so long as you choose to maintain its environment.\n\nIf you have any questions about Urchin's discontinuation and how it might impact you, planning for migration, support needs, or interest in our services for cloud archival of your Urchin server and data, simply contact us.\n\nOlder Version Owners\n\nFor owners of older Urchin license versions, here are my thoughts on Google's Urchin discontinuation announcement.\n\nIf you want to upgrade, now is the time. You will be forever unable to upgrade after the March 28th 2012 sales cut-off date. Urchin version 7 has many benefits over older versions, like faster processing, a data export API, an update user interface, and advanced segments to name a few. Plus, Urchin 7.2 (the latest and final release) will ensure you are set with what's most current before the upgrade window closes. Upgrading now to Urchin 7 will extend the life of your Urchin operation longer than remaining on an older version will allow.\n\nThat said, if you are happy with Urchin as-is, you don't need to do anything. So long as you can continue to maintain the Urchin operating environment, Urchin will continue to run. You're already running badly outdated software if you're using 6.x or older, and if that works for you, then there's no need to worry.\n\nPerhaps the main reason to upgrade to 7.2 before the sales cut-off date is the Data Export API in Urchin 7. The API is quite powerful and presents the most comprehensive option for exporting your data held within Urchin into another, more usable, format that will live beyond the limits of Urchin's reporting interface.\n\nIf you have any questions about Urchin's discontinuation, upgrading before license sales are ended, planning for migration, support needs, or interest in our services for cloud archival of your Urchin server and data, simply contact us.\n\nProspective Buyers\n\nIf you're currently evaluating a purchase of web analytics software, what are your options? Urchin was a great tool for in-house, software-based analytics and we think the analytics world is a little worse off without it around. That said, there are a few options for you to consider:\n\nBuy Urchin now, before it's too late. Now that future plans for Urchin are crystal clear, you can make an informed decision about purchase, taking into account the future for the software. Why buy a software platform that's going into retirement? Well, as I discussed above, we wouldn't call \"retirement\" of Urchin the end. It will be the software it is today as long as it runs. The only area where is is likely to become unusable is with AdWords API integration. If you really need this capability, you probably shouldn't be using Urchin for it anyway (Google Analytics is just plain way better for this). Details about purchase options can be found here.\n\nGo Google. Chances are you or some other area within your organization already uses Google Analytics. GA is extremely deep and powerful and can do just about everything Urchin can (and much more) with only a few areas where it falls short (logfile analysis of server-side errors being the chief shortcoming). Our services team are experts in making Google Analytics meet client needs, so perhaps GA is a viable option once it is fully setup to your organizations needs.\n\nLook for another option. Urchin isn't the only show in town. There are other options out there, however the list of analytics software providers has dwindled sharply in recent years. There are some open-source options, and some paid options. At the time of this writing we do not have a list of strong Urchin alternatives available, but we are working on researching and vetting comparable platforms and will be sure to share those as soon as we have it available.\n\nIf you have any questions about Urchin's discontinuation, buying before the sales cut-off, or interest in Google Analytics standard or premium, simply contact us.\n\nIn Closing - Thanks to the Urchin Team at Google\n\nWhile we are all sad to see an end come to the Urchin era, we are thankful for what Urchin has been and appreciate the work of those at Google who have advanced the product line over the last 7 years. Thank you!",
      "# [Results | Twiddy & Company | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/twiddy-company)\nSince its start in 1978, Twiddy & Company has provided visitors to North Carolina’s Outer Banks with a personal slice of classic southern hospitality. The family-owned vacation group offers more than 1,000 rental homes throughout the area to vacationers and manages the entire rental process from routine property upkeep to greeting guests during check-in. After more than 40 years in business, the Twiddy recipe of regional knowledge combined with premium customer service had already produced a lot of success for the company, but the Twiddy team knew they could take the business further.\n\nThe company had always maintained a sizable database that included years’ worth of past customer bookings but only kept this information around in archival storage that was rarely accessed. Twiddy needed a way to access and analyze visitor data and identify, connect with and convert potential customers for its vacation rentals.\n\nWe implemented Google Cloud giving Twiddy a powerful platform that connects data points with offline information, such as phone bookings and call times, to unlock in-depth marketing insights on customer behavior that drive growth.\n\nBigQuery provides a highly secure hub for the platform’s analytics processing needs. Twiddy only needs a single developer to run the platform and can even have non-IT staff pull data directly from the warehouse when needed, producing additional time and cost savings. Google Apps Script helps automate web query sourcing for BigQuery, while Data Studio powers data visualization for the platform, allowing property owners to better understand data such as listing traffic and conversion rates. This also gives Twiddy team members a real-time look at which homes and weeks are converting.\n\nApps Script automatically generates Sheets files that save team members time on data entry and analysis and give them real-time information for more informed customer interactions and improved customer experiences.\n\nBy working with us to build its analytics strategy on Google Cloud, Twiddy has transformed how it understands and reaches out to customers. Previously, Twiddy relied on calling customers based on collected rental histories, but by using its data warehouse, the company can better understand a customer’s specific interests and show them vacation properties that fit their exact needs.\n\nFor instance, one targeted landing page that sent exclusive deals to site visitors who searched for properties in a specific price range produced a 17% percent jump in email click-throughs compared to standard Twiddy marketing emails. Informed experimentation like this also yielded success across other campaigns thanks to the enhanced accessibility of data related to countless variables.\n\nWeb user behavior data from Google Analytics, as well as offline data, is imported into BigQuery, where it’s stored and processed. All of this vital information further informs Twiddy’s various approaches to marketing and guest services.\n\nWith intelligent campaigns and other new analytics capabilities powered by Adswerve and Google Cloud Platform, Twiddy also saw its sales close rate increase by an impressive 200%, a 36 percent year-over-year increase in transactions and site browsing session length, along with a conversation rate boost of 76 percent and 31 percent higher revenues, within campaigns."

Ads with Click Tracker A got approved, Ads with Click Tracker B got rejected (\"malicious software\"). We figured that they do not like click tracker B so we removed the click tracking redirect and had people land directly on the landing page.\n\nThey rejected the 2 new ads (4 rejected due to \"malicious software\" in total out of 6 submitted) and then the whole Partner ID got suspended due to \"Circumventing systems policies\" without having bought a single impression. \n\nOnly after this did we get feedback from DV360 support that there is a specific domain that is in the LP related to Click Tracker B that they deemed \"malware\" and wanted removed. That was removed from the LP and new ads using Click Tracker B posted to Adswerve's internal test account did properly get approved\n\nWe immediately appealed as recommended by Adswerve. 20 days later Adswerve inform us that Google has decided to keep the suspension:\n\n\"...*the context they were suspended by 'mistake' unfortunately does not meet our criteria of a reasonable appeal.”*\n\n*“DV360  has detected malware or suspicious activity within Advertiser's  account. Based on signals, we believe their intent was to violate  Google’s Abusive Experiences policies by cloaking or concealing their  ads' true destination and/or behavior and evade our policy review  systems.”*\n\nAdswerve says it is what it is and there is nothing that could be done.   \n\n\nThis sounds so ridiculous that it is unbelievable.

Have adswerve loop in their google account team to conduct a manual review and they should be able to tell you if the landing page is safe and approved by google.

That would help narrow the scope. \n\nMost of the \\*good\\* DSPs have minimums of some sort, whether that is the monthly or annual spend commitment, or minimum per buy. All of the ones you listed have fairly hefty annual commitments, but are mostly recognized as being in the upper class of DSPs in terms of features, inventory, and integrations (DV360 and TTD usually at the very top of that list, as well as for cost.) Others worth mentioning in this class are Basis and Adobe Ad Cloud -- both require commitments. If you can justify an annual commitment of $250k, you can get in the door with Basis, MediaMath, maybe Xandr? \n\nSome of the DSPs have resellers, who can hook you up with a seat without the monstrous commitment. There are a number of them for DV360, but you still need to be spending quite a bit per month to justify it. \n\nA few other lower tier DSPs can still get you a lot of what you want -- depending on what your requirements are. There's always Google Ads as the default -- this gets you display and YouTube. \n\nI really like StackAdapt. No commitments, but is fully featured in a nice UI. Lots of integrations with other platforms. Display, video, native. \n\nPontiac Media is a pretty solid offering. The UI isn't great, but the tech underneath is built upon Xandr, so is fairly robust. It has a small monthly fee of like $25 if you aren't actively spending anything, but otherwise no commitment.\n\n### Comment ID jm8jljf with +5 score by [(doug_kaplan, Reddit, 2023-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/13vw8sy/best_entry_level_dsp/jm8jljf/) (in reply to ID jm8hxcs):\nI second StackAdapt, no minimum monthly spend and no contract so makes it easy to dip your toes in or leave with ease and is fairly full featured.\n\n### Comment ID jmb49lb with +1 score by [(MirsadZ, Reddit, 2023-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/13vw8sy/best_entry_level_dsp/jmb49lb/) (in reply to ID jm8hxcs):\nThanks so much for the detailed explanation.\nFor context we still don't know the exact budget.

However, Cliniko has made it difficult to track user's sales conversion whenever a booking is made on our website. Once a booking is made, the page does not reload or redirect to a confirmation page as everything happens within the iframe.\n\n  \nUpon further investigation, we found out that Cliniko blacklisted Google Analytics due to the UK-EU GDPR laws. We, therefore, need to create a workaround, which has partially been made by inserting a listening event script on the page, which is then picked up on Google Tag Manager.\n\n  \nHowever, the issue with that is that we have no way of tracking what service was booked and how much it was.

Then listening for changes in the 'parent' browser dataLayer. So it would not be an issue of blocking Google Analytics. Could it be that Cliniko is blocking either the postMessage method or maybe Javascript entirely?\n\n## Comment ID kaz1qob with +1 score by [(StefanAtWork, Reddit, 2023-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/180xbte/iframe_conversion_tracking_workaround/kaz1qob/) (in reply to ID 180xbte):\nIf you want to see a real-world implementation of Iframe tracking, see [https://www.theritzlondon.com/](https://www.theritzlondon.com/) and go to the \"Dine With Us\" option and click into e.g. \"The Ritz Restaurant\".\n\nThe Iframe embed contains its own GTM container we were allowed to place there by the booking service provider [www.sevenrooms.com](https://www.sevenrooms.com)\n\nThe GTM container hosts a single Custom HTML tag (fired on All Pages) and that tag was built using the info here: [https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/cookieless-tracking-cross-site-iframes/](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/cookieless-tracking-cross-site-iframes/)\n\nIf you have a suitable debugging extension (AdSwerve dataLayer Inspector+ is great), you'll easily be able to see the events being sent from the Iframe to the \"parent\" GTM, as they are all prefixed with `sriframe.`\n\nThere are still limitations.

Server-side is great, but it has some limitations. The implementations I've seen all involve double tagging. One set for standard web and another for server-side. Separate ID's.\n\nIt's really your call whether you want to have server-side sending data to a separate measurement ID than the standard web tag, or only have server-side send data to GA4.\n\nYou need to make sure your GA4 configuration tag fires before any other GA4 tags. Google say to fire the config tag using the \"initialization\" trigger, but you can also use tag sequencing on the other GA4 tags to always run the config tag first.\n\nThe measurement ID in your config tag (the one that sends data to server-side) is irrelevant, unless you choose to pass it through from server-side.\n\nI don't. I send a dummy measurement ID and I set the measurement ID myself in the sGTM container.\n\n\"Google Signals\" is apparently not compatible with server-side, so if you want GA4 audience building, you will still need a data stream collecting data using the standard web tag.\n\n### Comment ID ixqrnpt with +3 score by [(Swiss_Mike, Reddit, 2022-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/z4ahh0/serverside_ga4_implementation_question/ixqrnpt/) (in reply to ID ixqgy20):\nThank you for taking the time in responding! Doing some further debug my duplicate event issue is definitely coming from my Web container after i enable \"Send to server container\" on my Web GA4 base tag.\n\nI think my issue is likely linked to me having separate GA4 config tags that were setup in wGTM that are sending Facebook CAPI data to the server using the GA4 client... So likely  i am duplicating the event streaming into sGTM via multiple GA4 config tags .. more debug required.

In-fact isnt there an advantage to it so i can control what i send into GA and how? \n\nFor example one of the markets we operate in (in EU) only allow for GA to be used if done server-side, in that case the answer can only be to only have a valid Measurement ID in the server-side tag, right?\n\nThanks appreciate the help, i'm new to this so trying to sponge it all up!",

Lots of third-hand feedback delivered through your boss because people are too cowardly to say what's on their mind. \n-Clueless, unaccountable leadership: Company touts that they didn't lay anyone off during the pandemic, then lays off 5% of the company last year, then continues to tout that they didn't lay anyone off!\n-Backstabbing Culture: No one is willing to deliver DIRECT feedback. Get used to having someone talk to your boss about you! It squashes any attempt at asking for help out of fear that someone will perceive it as weakness, resulting in termination. \n-High turnover: People disappear under \"suspicious circumstances\" (often at terrible times for client and project health). Executives are not exempt from this either. The company lost their COO and chief salesperson recently, then worked to spin their departure as a coincidence instead of a reflection of the company. Womp womp. \n-Inconsistent and contradictory goal requirements: There is no incentive to do strategic work that could make the company better when all of the company's goals and OKRs are about sales and billable time. Templates for docs like SOWs and legal-approved contracts desperately need overhauling, but no one has time or bandwidth to work on those tasks over client work. \n-Awful clients: Adswerve lives off its relationships with companies like Google and Adobe, so they often get the dregs that can't or won't pay for a real consulting firm. \n-Sneaky HR Practices: I've never heard of a company treating cost-of-living increases as \"merit\" increases. This is insulting, especially during a time of record inflation.",

Full-time means 40 hours, which is rare in a lot of agencies where this can be seen as more of a 'starting place'.\r\n\r\nThe holiday parties are a blast, snacks and drinks are provided, ping pong and Nintendo during the slower times.",

This is mostly due to a combination of bottleneck in client work (not enough to go around) as well as preference for skilled workers to be put on client work opposed to ones that don’t have much experience. My feedback here would be to allow the hire to shadow these working sessions and maybe even get them involved in some way so that the opportunity for growth is still there. \n\nThey don’t necessarily have to bill the client for it; but it’ll help facilitate learning as opposed to just being shut out of projects due to lack of skill and being placed on the back burner.\n\n- Sometimes, leadership will have disagreements in what feedback they give to an employee. A director will say one thing whilst approaching employee separately without manager, and a manager will say another in a separate meeting. It’s hard to tell what exactly leadership wants.",

Get used to having someone talk to your boss about you! It squashes any attempt at asking for help out of fear that someone will perceive it as weakness, resulting in termination. \n-High turnover: People disappear under \"suspicious circumstances\" (often at terrible times for client and project health). Executives are not exempt from this either. The company lost their COO and chief salesperson recently, then worked to spin their departure as a coincidence instead of a reflection of the company. Womp womp. \n-Inconsistent and contradictory goal requirements: There is no incentive to do strategic work that could make the company better when all of the company's goals and OKRs are about sales and billable time. Templates for docs like SOWs and legal-approved contracts desperately need overhauling, but no one has time or bandwidth to work on those tasks over client work. \n-Awful clients: Adswerve lives off its relationships with companies like Google and Adobe, so they often get the dregs that can't or won't pay for a real consulting firm. \n-Sneaky HR Practices: I've never heard of a company treating cost-of-living increases as \"merit\" increases.

      "# [A New Approach to Attribution: How Marketers Can Adapt by Jake Woodburn on 2024-03-26](https://adswerve.com/blog/a-new-approach-to-attribution-how-marketers-can-adapt)\nIn the ever-evolving digital marketing landscape, staying ahead of the curve is not just an option—it's a necessity. As we sail into the future, the Google Marketing Platform is preparing for a seismic shift in its attribution strategies, setting the stage for a new era in online advertising. Today, we delve into the intricacies of Google's Attribution Odyssey and the impending changes, particularly those involving cookies.\n\nThe Current Attribution Landscape\n\nThe Google Marketing Platform has long been a beacon for marketers seeking accurate and insightful attribution data. The platform's current model relies heavily on cookies, those tiny bits of data that follow users as they traverse the vast landscape of the internet. Cookies have been the unsung heroes, silently collecting information about user interactions and helping marketers understand the customer journey.\n\nHowever, the attribution playbook is about to undergo a rewrite.\n\nThe Cookie Chronicles\n\nEnter the era of change. As privacy concerns gain prominence and regulatory landscapes shift, cookies face increased scrutiny. Google is poised to respond with a series of platform changes designed to prioritize user privacy without sacrificing the quality of attribution data.\n\nThe Sunset of Third-Party Cookies\n\nGoogle has announced plans to phase out third-party cookies on its Chrome browser in 2024. This move aims to bolster user privacy by limiting cross-site tracking, but it also prompts marketers to rethink their attribution strategies.\n\nFirst-Party Data Renaissance\n\nWith third-party cookies on the way out, first-party data becomes more valuable than ever. Google Marketing Platform encourages marketers to cultivate and leverage their first-party data to maintain a robust understanding of user behavior.\n\nAI and Machine Learning Integration\n\nEmbracing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning, Google is enhancing its attribution models. These technologies will play a pivotal role in filling the void left by traditional tracking methods, providing more accurate insights into customer touchpoints.\n\nHow Will Marketers Leverage Tools to Help Them?\n\nThe Privacy Sandbox\n\nMost marketers don’t — and won’t — have access to the Privacy Sandbox. However, they can leverage learnings from it. As the Privacy Sandbox develops more advanced use cases, marketers will gain the ability to replicate some of the current use cases that rely on third-party cookies or other tracking mechanisms. This evolution will enable marketers to continue to leverage sophisticated targeting, attribution and measurement techniques while ensuring greater privacy protection for users. By embracing the Privacy Sandbox outcomes and its innovative solutions, marketers can adapt to the changing digital landscape and maintain effective advertising strategies that respect user privacy preferences.\n\nFor those looking for additional guidance or wanting to explore the Privacy Sandbox, don’t be afraid to seek out additional help. Knowledgeable partners like Adswerve have access to the Privacy Sandbox and can help explore potential solutions tailored to our customers' journey through the evolving digital landscape. A single conversation might be the starting point for clarity and direction. Please reach out if you’re interested in how this could benefit your strategy.\n\nGoogle Attribution Reporting API\n\nThe Google Attribution Reporting API is a programming interface that allows developers to access and retrieve attribution data from Google Ads and other Google marketing products. This API enables users to programmatically access and integrate attribution data, such as conversion metrics and attribution models, into their reporting tools or systems. With the Attribution Reporting API, developers can automate the retrieval of attribution data, allowing for more efficient analysis and reporting of marketing campaign performance across different channels and touchpoints.\n\nMulti-Touch Attribution Models and Marketing Mix Modeling\n\nMulti-touch attribution (MTA) models, especially Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM), will be crucial in navigating digital media attribution's future. MMM is a statistical analysis technique that helps marketers understand the impact of various marketing channels and tactics on overall performance and outcomes, such as sales or conversions.\n\nClients have successfully employed the power of MMM/MTA for a multitude of use cases to understand their digital media performance across various channels. Some real-life examples throughout the last year include guidance for optimizations, bidding and budgeting based on a customer acquisition cost (CAC). Using CAC from multiple data sources, advertisers can gain a more holistic view of their customer acquisition efforts and identify opportunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Use cases may vary by each client’s needs, whether a long-term analysis as the source of truth or a short-term test against other measurement tools.\n\nClient examples utilizing MMM/MTA over the past year have varied — from heavy reliance on the modeled data to dictate monthly budgets based on the impact of ROI from each media channel to head-to-head A/B testing measuring cohort analysis to further understand audience control.\n\nServer Side Tagging in Google Tag Manager\n\nServer-side cookies are cookies set, managed and accessed by a server rather than a user's browser. They are often used with client-side cookies to enhance security, improve performance and manage user sessions more effectively. In the context of first-party data, server-side cookies can be crucial in helping websites and applications collect and manage user data. Advanced use cases of this setup could ultimately help the durability of 1st-party cookies.\n\nPreparing for the Transition\n\nAdapting to the forthcoming changes in the Google Marketing Platform's attribution landscape requires a proactive approach:\n\nEducate Your Team\n\nEnsure that your marketing team is well-versed in the upcoming changes. Understanding the evolving attribution models will empower them to make informed decisions.\n\nAudit Your Data Sources\n\nTake stock of your existing data sources and evaluate their compliance with the changing privacy standards. Diversify your data collection methods and prioritize first-party data.\n\nExplore New Attribution Models\n\nThe Google Marketing Platform is likely to introduce alternative attribution models. Experiment with different approaches to discover what aligns best with your campaign goals and audience.\n\nThe Journey to Come\n\nThe attribution journey is on the brink of a revolution, and Google Marketing Platform is at the helm. By embracing these changes and adapting your strategies accordingly, you can confidently navigate the evolving landscape. As we bid farewell to third-party cookies and usher in a new era of attribution, the key lies in staying agile, informed and ready for the marketing adventures ahead.",

      "# [Third-Party Cookie Delay: A Reprieve, Not a Respite for Marketers on 2024-04-25](https://adswerve.com/blog/third-party-cookie-delay-a-reprieve-not-a-respite-for-marketers)\nGoogle has pushed back the end of third-party cookies (3PC) in Chrome yet again, with a new target of early 2025. This news offers a sigh of relief for some, but it's crucial to remember this is a delay and not a cancellation. Let's unpack what this means for the industry, and how you can make the most of this reprieve using the additional resources provided below.\n\nA Shifting Timeline\n\nRemember when 2020 was supposed to be the year of the 3PC apocalypse? The industry spoke, and Google listened. Here's the revised timeline:\n\nJanuary 2020: Google initially announced plans to phase out 3PC within two years.\n\nFebruary 2022: The first delay hit, with the sunset pushed to late 2023.\n\nJanuary 2024: The timeline shifted again, targeting a mid-2024 deprecation.\n\nApril 2024: Google’s most recent update places the official end date in early 2025.\n\nWhy the Delay?\n\nTwo key factors contributed to Google's decision:\n\nIndustry Concerns: Marketers and developers expressed a need for more time to adapt and explore alternatives. Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative, designed to replace 3PC tracking, needed further refinement.\n\nRegulatory Scrutiny: Antitrust investigations, particularly from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), prompted Google to address competition concerns before completely phasing out 3PC.\n\nWhat This Means for the Privacy Sandbox Initiatives\n\nWhile the phase-out of third-party cookies (3PC) has been pushed back to early 2025, most initiatives within the Privacy Sandbox, including the Topics API, Protected Audience API and Attribution Reporting API, are still on track for a Q3 2024 rollout.\n\nTesting Time Extended: The delay offers valuable extra time for developers and testers to refine Privacy Sandbox solutions within Chrome. This translates to potentially smoother functionality and a more seamless transition for advertisers when 3PC finally sunsets. Solutions in development include:\n\nEnhanced Cohort Targeting: Refining how advertisers target audience segments based on similar interests or browsing behaviors without relying on individual user identifiers.\n\nImproved Contextual Targeting: Testing methods for analyzing the context of webpages and content to deliver relevant ads without user tracking.\n\nPrivacy-Preserving Attribution: Developing solutions that accurately measure campaign effectiveness while upholding user privacy standards.\n\nIntegration Focus: Expect continued development on integrating these Sandbox solutions with Google Marketing Platform (GMP) products like Display & Video 360 (DV360) and Campaign Manager 360 (CM360). This will ensure a streamlined workflow for managing campaigns after 3PC deprecation.\n\nAddressing Industry Feedback: Google can use the additional time to incorporate valuable industry feedback. This could lead to increased transparency around how the Sandbox works, more open collaboration with stakeholders and potential adjustments to features based on advertiser needs.\n\nBonus time for website owners:\n\nThe delay also offers an advantage for website owners. Here are two proposals where you can take action:\n\nRelated Website Sets (RWS): Do you have a company with websites on multiple domains (e.g., brandx.com and fly-brandx.com) or domains for different countries (such as example.com, example.rs, example.uk, etc.)? RWS lets these sites share cookies. With the delay, you have more time to submit your domains for approval within RWS. Pro Tip: Make sure your domains meet the RWS guidelines before Q3 2024.\n\nCHIPS (SameSite=Lax for Cookies with Partitioned Storage): Do you use embedded services like chat widgets? CHIPS allows these services to use cookies with your main website. The extra time allows you to test and implement CHIPS if it works for your website.\n\n“While 2025 is now the official 3PC end date, acting now is the smart move. At Adswerve, we’re constantly testing solutions that will work best for advertisers and website owners while prioritizing user privacy. We’re also aggressively exploring Privacy Sandbox initiatives and finding ways to best utilize those solutions for our clients. The time for complacency is over; let’s get to work.”\n\n- Luka Cempre, Senior Data Scientist\n\nWhat This Means for Marketers\n\nMore Time to Adapt: This delay offers a valuable window to test and refine cookieless marketing strategies. Focus on collecting first-party (1P) data directly from your users. Integrate this with data from your own systems (like your CMS) to create a powerful, unified customer picture. Leverage user modeling and contextual targeting to deliver relevant experiences, and explore alternative identifiers to enhance your reach.\n\nUrgency Still Exists: While the deadline shifts, the cookieless future is inevitable. Don't get complacent. Prioritize building a sustainable, privacy-first marketing approach.\n\n“The viability of 3PC has been degrading for years. The playbook for how to respond is the same today as it was before this delay. Marketers should continue moving ahead with their plans as if 3rd party cookies are already gone.”\n\n- Jake Winter, Principal Lead\n\nWhat This Means for Agencies\n\nUpskilling Opportunity: Invest in training your team on cookieless solutions, data privacy regulations and alternative targeting methods.\n\nClient Education Is Key: Guide your clients through the upcoming changes and their impact on campaigns.\n\nNew Revenue Streams Emerge: Expertise in 1P data and privacy-compliant measurement can be a valuable asset for agencies.\n\n“Time is a finite thing, and I implore our agency partners to look at the extra time as an opportunity to focus on actioning the long-term plans that pertain to cookie deprecation rather than short-term fixes. Agencies should continue working with their clients to test and learn durable cookieless solutions, so they have more concrete and proven strategies in place when the deadline comes. Keep pushing forward; 2025 will be here faster than we think.”- Kelly Hayes, Director of Account Management, Agency\n\nWhat This Means for The Google Marketing Platform (GMP)\n\nFocus on Privacy Sandbox: Expect to see continued development and testing of Privacy Sandbox integrations within DV360, CM360 and other platforms. These solutions will leverage technologies like Conversion Domains and Floodlight Conversion Categories to help you reach your target audiences effectively while respecting user privacy.\n\n1P Data Takes Center Stage: Look for further development of tools within GMP to streamline 1P data collection and campaign integration. Focus on collaborating with internal teams to gather as much 1P data as possible and leverage GMP for seamless data utilization.\n\nGA4 Remains Central: Expect ongoing development of GA4's functionalities for collecting and analyzing privacy-compliant data. Use the extended timeframe to test and refine existing workflows and explore new possibilities within GA4, including:\n\nSetting up GA4 for media measurement.\n\nEstablishing audience segmentation strategies.\n\nConfiguring BigQuery data exports.\n\nImplementing event-based bidding tactics.\n\n“The net result is unaffected. We were just given a little gift of being able to connect and align more between upcoming Summer PTOs and hectic calendars. We have the opportunity to feel a little less anxious, but media and analytics teams shouldn’t cancel 3PCD-related items like team meetings, roadmap developments or strategy change approvals. Instead, use the given time to double down and really think about what GMP strategies will be the best suited for your goals and needs, rather than rushing to accomplish a baseline ‘good enough’ because there wasn’t enough time.\"\n\n- Mary Kotara, Lead Consultant, Media\n\n“Cookies will live on into 2025, but focusing on your 3PCD readiness shouldn’t change. Taking actionable steps within the respective GMP platforms, dialing in your 1P data strategy and shaping your overall mindset to make sure you’re prepared should remain top priorities.”\n\n- Jeff Collins, Associate Director, Media Activation\n\nA Final Note\n\nWhile Google extends the timeline for phasing out 3PC, it's important to remember that other browsers like Safari and Firefox have already blocked 3PC. Use this delay to your advantage — experiment, build a strong data foundation and emerge from this shift stronger than ever.\n\nDon't wait until the very last minute — the future is now, and it's privacy-focused.\n\n\"This delay gives the industry a brief reprieve, but it doesn’t mean you should slow down or sideline any efforts you have in development. Anything done now to build a 1P data strategy is only going to get you further ahead of the curve!\"\n\n- Lars von Sneidern, Sr. Director of Analytics / Services Product Manager\n\nNeed help developing and executing your strategy for 3PC deprecation?

      "# [Results | Six Flags | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/six-flags)\nEntertainment giant Six Flags operates theme parks and attractions throughout North America. Their marketing team relies heavily on data from its web, app and sales platforms to monitor sales and marketing metrics and make informed decisions about park operations and guest experiences.\n\nSix Flags partnered with Google Cloud and Adswerve for a marketing analytics workshop to help identify untapped opportunities in their data. Through that process, the teams pinpointed an initiative to explore expanding Six Flags’ existing social sentiment initiative.\n\nTheir legacy sentiment tool was limited to providing a high-level brand score and couldn’t connect to Reddit, which was a big ask from senior leadership. Both the marketing team and the C-suite wanted the ability to go deeper to create and monitor scores by park location and key categories so they could better understand what products and experiences visitors enjoy — and uncover friction points they need to act on.\n\nUltimately, the Six Flags marketing team wanted to understand their guests’ perceptions of the brand, parks and customer experience to see what works and what doesn’t — and easily share the findings with the C-suite for visibility, investigation and quick action.\n\nAdswerve got to work, diving into Six Flags' robust social sentiment solution needs. The team uncovered that Six Flags wanted to monitor sentiment in five core categories: entertainment, food & beverage, price, cleanliness, wait times and customer experience for each of its 27 parks across five social platforms: Google Reviews, Trip Advisor, Instagram, Facebook and Reddit. Because Six Flags operates parks in Canada and Mexico, they also needed the ability to translate French and Spanish social posts into English.\n\nAfter thoroughly investigating Six Flags' solution requirements, we began building a new, more robust social sentiment tool. We used Amplify to connect the five social sources in Google Cloud Platform’s data warehouse, BigQuery, reducing the need for custom API development and shortening implementation time.\n\nOnce we connected the data, our data engineers leveraged the full power of Google Cloud to automate data pulls, transform data (including translating other languages into English), assign sentiment scores and categories, create trend summaries using generative AI and push the synthesized information to Looker in real time. It all happens from one platform with one SQL query.\n\nSix Flags can now view and share a Looker dashboard that includes overall and park-specific sentiment scores and uses generative AI to surface the top five positive and negative trends in a \"week in review\" summary. They can easily see performance and insights — and the social comments driving them — and monitor them over time.\n\nThe power of this data was realized shortly into the project while the dashboard was still in development. A park approached marketing to update its highly trafficked park homepage, theorizing visitors were unhappy with recent maintenance impacting ride availability. Six Flags marketing was able to quickly validate the topic was trending for the park in the initial data sets and move forward confidently with the site update to better set expectations for visitors. And while seasonality and completed maintenance both play a part, the park has seen fewer negative posts and its customer experience sentiment score climb month-over-month since implementing the change.\n\nToday, Six Flags can easily view and understand overall customer sentiment and drill in by park across the five main performance categories in their Looker dashboard to uncover additional opportunities to improve the customer experience. If sentiment drops in a particular park in a specific category over time, they can explore the reasons and quickly remedy them. Similarly, they can identify why sudden dips or spikes are happening and quantify how critical an issue is by how many people are discussing it. The Six Flags marketing team can also see the immediate impact price changes, new or updated rides, events, seasonality and more have on sentiment in the short and long term, and make appropriate changes to their digital marketing programs, park operations and more.\n\nBeyond providing powerful insights, the new solution saves Six Flags time. What used to be a manual process, taking 15 people two to three hours per week each, is now fully automated, incorporates the latest AI technology and is easily shareable with organization stakeholders.\n\nUp next? Six Flags is entering their busy events season and plans to use the new social sentiment tool to see how national events stack up against park-specific ones. They’ll incorporate their learning into their future events strategy. The team also plans to add X (formerly Twitter) to their selected social platform sources.",

      "# [Life after Server Calls: Comparing Adobe Analytics and CJA Licensing by Jake Winter on 2024-03-19](https://adswerve.com/blog/life-after-server-calls-comparing-adobe-analytics-and-cja-licensing)\nAdobe Analytics gets a lot of love from its users for its deep feature set, ability to explore clickstream data and curate self-serve reports and dashboards. Yet when it comes to the person responsible for the Adobe Analytics contract (especially finance), if you ask what gives them heartburn, you’ll get an almost unanimous answer: server calls.\n\nNo matter how robust your model, how thorough your server call audit or how big of a buffer you bake into your contract, there always seems to be something to derail your server call budget. A runaway site monitoring bot. Scroll tracking that triggered four milestones on page load that no one found for a month. Or, that new widget that went viral after an influencer mentioned it. Now, you’re crawling back to your leaders and procurement to approve an(other) overage.\n\nWith all of the airtime Adobe gives to Customer Journey Analytics (CJA), you have very likely heard about the benefits of its first-party data and cross-channel capabilities. Less discussed is how CJA can also handle most Adobe Analytics use cases, while using modern data platform capabilities and a new licensing model to put to bed angst associated with server calls.\n\nFor those needing a refresher, a server call represents every event sent from your website or mobile app to Adobe’s collection server. In contrast, Adobe Customer Journey Analytics uses the number of rows or events that are available for use (or “reportable”) in CJA. Big whoop, right? They may sound similar, but the difference is significant.\n\nThink of your website and the flow of events coming from it as a spigot. When you purchase Adobe Analytics (AA) and tag your site, you connect a hose to it and turn on the events that flow directly into Adobe’s servers. With AA, you pay for everything that comes from the hose, regardless of what it is. If a bunch of gunk (e.g., bots, QA data) unexpectedly starts coming out, your primary option is to turn off the spigot (i.e., turn off your tag). Otherwise, you have to start an investigation with IT or purchase tools to prevent the gunk from getting in the hose. And you still have to pay for the gunk that already came out.\n\nWith CJA, that hose of events goes into the Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) data lake first. Adobe includes access to AEP with every CJA license. In our analogy, it’s a trough to dump data into first. When configuring CJA, you pick and choose which events from AEP you’ll bring into CJA. If there’s gunk in AEP, you can remove it and the updates cascade to CJA. Every quarter, the number of reportable events in CJA is averaged and considered your contracted “rows.” In other words, in AA you pay for what comes out of the hose and with CJA you pay for the size of the bucket.\n\nThe result is far more value-based, incentivizing data quality over quantity. With the “rows” model, you have a handful of options to control and curate the data that appears in CJA and ultimately hits your budget. Here are four of those critical levers.\n\nFour Critical Levers to Curate Data for CJA\n\nCJA Connection: Rolling Data Windows\n\nLevel of complexity: Low\n\nLevel of control: Medium\n\nLicense considerations: None\n\nYour first line of defense is a blunt but effective option to avoid overages. If row counts run up against your contract, CJA allows you to dial forward a Connection’s retention to effectively purge the oldest data from the CJA bucket. The underlying data remains in AEP and you can bring it back in if you renegotiate or free up rows. Keep in mind that if you have multiple datasets in a single Connection, all of the datasets will share the same retention.\n\nAEP APIs: Dataset Pruning\n\nLevel of complexity: Medium\n\nLevel of control: Medium\n\nLicense considerations: Foundation SKU does not have ad hoc Query Service access\n\nUnlike the first option that changes data in CJA, this is a permanent change in the AEP data lake, so use it carefully. As mentioned above, the Connection level retention in CJA is uniform across all datasets. Utilizing the AEP Batch Ingestion API, you can manually remove older batches from AEP datasets.\n\nFor example, let's say you want to bring in high-volume impression data and only have use cases for the prior six months, but you want to keep your other website data at a 24-month retention in the Connection. You could use Query Service to retrieve the batch IDs (_acp_system_metadata.acp_sourceBatchId) older than six months, then use the API to delete those batch IDs. Again, this one is permanent, so use it carefully, but it can help you more precisely manage retention.\n\nComing Soon:Data Lifecycle “delete records” capabilities may help simplify this task, eliminating the need to retrieve batch IDs via query.\n\nAEP Query Service Data Distiller\n\nLevel of complexity: Medium\n\nLevel of control: Medium\n\nLicense considerations: Requires Data Distiller Add-On SKU\n\nData Distiller encompasses the SQL commands within Query Service required to transform existing data and schedule them to be completed on a regular cadence in AEP. The functions it enables generally require a more advanced level of SQL skills. If you’re familiar with the Data Repair API in AA, Data Distiller addresses those use cases and more. Some potential options to control rows include:\n\nStoring raw event collection in a separate dataset than the one used for CJA. This can allow you to run hourly batch queries to cleanse and filter the raw data and output a clean dataset for CJA. The downside is the introduction of additional latency for end users, but in the context of customer journeys, cleaner data can often provide more value than fast data.\n\nRunning an archiving process on your data that moves it from an ongoing dataset to a historical one. As part of the archiving, you can apply bots and other filters. With this approach, you’d have to be diligent about creating filters at the Data View to ensure that the bots excluded as part of the archiving process are similarly excluded from your ongoing dataset to prevent big shifts after the archive process runs. One downside for this option would be that you would have to process all your events into CJA two times: once for the initial ongoing ingest and again for archiving.\n\nOne-off data cleansing tasks to remove unwanted QA data, bots or sensitive PII. This can be achieved by running a query on the affected time period and using the Create Table As (CTAS) function to save a new table with the clean data. Then, with the above batch removal process, you can remove the bad batches and bring the clean ones back in.\n\nThese examples scratch the surface of what’s possible with SQL transformation and scheduling. Adding Data Distiller is a substantial upgrade in how you can control your data within the walls of AEP.\n\nCapturing Events in an External Cloud\n\nLevel of complexity: High\n\nLevel of control: High\n\nLicense considerations: None\n\nLastly, the most flexible approach you can take to control how many rows are consumed is to collect your events outside of Adobe in another cloud platform. While this can be a major change in how you collect and use digital analytics data, it provides maximum control over what you choose to put into AEP. Unsurprisingly, it also requires the most resources and careful planning. This is actually possible with Adobe Analytics via APIs, as well, and used by a small number of AA users, but the AEP source connectors and schemas have made this architectural pattern even more accessible and convenient for CJA.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nIt gives you full control over the filtering of bots or other unwanted data\n\nYou can transform data, including the ability to stitch identities across events\n\nYou can collapse separate events (impressions, scroll tracking, etc.) into single events to optimize row count.\n\nWhen an event occurs, you can enrich it with other data within your cloud data warehouse, such as product, company or demographic information.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nYou need significant data engineering resources to build and maintain pipelines.\n\nIt may impact latency due to additional hops across platforms, performing transformations and applying filters.\n\nYou need to be aware of storage and consumption costs within cloud platforms. Without oversight and optimization, these can exceed any potential savings.\n\nIP and User Agent enrichments are built into the Edge Network and ingest into AEP, so those either need to be recreated or ingest must be routed through the Edge Network Server API.\n\nThe approach can impact real-time personalization use cases with other Adobe products, depending on how you implement it.\n\nRegardless of the approaches you take to curate your data, the fact that you have options is a refreshing change of pace. Your finance and procurement partners will value the stability and predictability. Costs can and will go up, but the looming threat of overages should be more manageable and you’ll be able to forecast and plan for increases using the levers afforded to you in AEP.\n\nAdditional Pricing Model Considerations\n\nThere are a few stipulations and guardrails that Adobe has put in place to prevent customers from taking advantage of the rows pricing model:\n\nWhen getting to the contracting details, CJA rows are broken into two buckets. The first is the current rolling 13 months and is considered your CJA licensed rows. A second bucket can be purchased with an add-on SKU for events older than 13 months. Keep this in mind when deciding how much history you want to make available in CJA.\n\nTo keep you from cramming too much into a single row, the average row size can’t exceed 2 KB. A typical web or mobile implementation generally stays under 1 KB per event.\n\nThere’s a limit of 3X your contracted rows that can be ingested into CJA in one year. This could become relevant if you frequently remove data, clean it and reload it.\n\nAEP storage is limited to 5 KB per contracted row in CJA. The longer you're using AEP, the more important it will be to make sure you remove unnecessary data in AEP. As you start making copies of large event datasets, the gigabytes can quickly start turning into terabytes. An additional AEP storage add-on SKU is available to expand storage if needed.\n\nAdobe is in the business of making money, so they’ll continue to evolve how they license their products to make sure they’re profitable. The details from contract to contract can differ, so always read the fine print and be open about how you plan to bring data into CJA during the negotiation process. For example, if you plan to create a process with Data Distiller that prevents bots from being brought into CJA as rows, be transparent, and Adobe can make sure you have the capacity within AEP to facilitate that approach.",

      "# [Giving the Modern Data Stack a Boost With Adobe CJA by Jake Winter on 2024-02-13](https://adswerve.com/blog/giving-the-modern-data-stack-a-boost-with-adobe-cja)\nBeing in the data and analytics field rarely inspires excitement. You can only rearrange data, charts and tables in so many ways before things start to get repetitive. When the latest and greatest hot new skill everyone should learn is SQL (btw happy 50th birthday!), it becomes obvious that real change and innovation is a rare occurrence in this field.\n\nTo that point, a big part of why I get so excited about Adobe Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) is because it may be the most innovative analytics product in the market right now. To be clear, that’s not specific to digital analytics and adjacent tools — that’s all analytics and BI tools.\n\nThe State of the Modern Data Stack\n\nWhy do I feel so strongly? It has a lot to do with the current state of the buzzwordy “modern data stack” and where data teams are currently experiencing challenges. To oversimplify, the modern data stack is the set of tools enabling data warehousing in the cloud.\n\nWith the migration to the cloud, many teams took the opportunity to reassess the classic Extract-Transform-Load pattern, or ETL, to bring data into a data warehouse for analytics use. Instead, many opted to flip the last two steps into ELT. This shortened the path to getting data loaded into the cloud and took advantage of the expanded amount of storage and compute offered by the cloud. Additionally, it offered flexibility by decoupling transformations from the loading of data. In the ETL days, combining columns and applying logic to create a new column involved complicated redeployments of entire pipelines. With ELT, using a tool like dbt, it can be a few SQL updates.\n\nIn the modern data stack, turning raw data into usable data models has become the new gold, but because it requires a high level of domain expertise, it’s also people and process-intensive. This has resulted in the bottleneck moving downstream to the SQL and analytics engineers preparing data for BI use. As data in the cloud proliferates, the questions increase, the mashups of datasets become more complex and there are only so many SQL developers. The reality remains that not everyone who needs insights can learn SQL. Because of this, data exploration, discovery and insight generation haven’t been able to scale with the cloud warehouses.\n\nWhat does any of this have to do with CJA? CJA’s predecessor, Adobe Analytics, is a self-contained, purpose-built digital analytics tool with a built-in data model optimized to rapidly explore and visualize a specific type of data: streaming events from digital experiences, AKA clickstream. Its biggest strength has been a self-service, no-code Workspace user interface that allows analysts and business users to rapidly generate and test hypotheses about user behaviors, uncovering insights across a sprawling clickstream dataset without any knowledge of SQL.\n\nWith CJA, Adobe has blown out the backend of the Adobe Analytics data model and opened it to event datasets of any schema. As long as there is a consistent Person ID and a timestamp, even physical events can be brought in, including appointments, phone calls, in-store purchases, etc. Here, you can start to see where the two worlds of the modern data stack and CJA may converge. By constructing a highly interactive and optimized data model with the sole purpose of rapidly finding relationships between dimensions and metrics, CJA solves a lot of transformation problems. Those relationships are pre-calculated as they’re processed into the data model to keep reading the results performant.\n\nNot all data are events, and CJA is not an answer for those. However, the innovation that it signals is the idea that purpose-built data models can be placed over cloud data warehouses and, without much more than some schema mapping, suck up data and create use case-specific tools to aid rapid data exploration. Additionally, with Amplitude announcing a Snowflake-native version of its tool, it becomes obvious that this is a space that analytics vendors see as an opportunity. Outside of event data and customer journeys, I could see tailored tools for other domains, such as supply chain, people/HR, health care and more.\n\nTransformational Derived Fields\n\nWhere CJA further differentiated itself this past year was with the introduction of derived fields. The feature allows data ingested into the tool’s data model to be transformed on the fly. If you think about the earlier task of combining a few columns and adding some logic, this is the perfect application of derived fields.\n\nIn SQL, if the change is simple enough, it might be able to be done with a view, but it will likely require changes to the data model and a replay. In Adobe Analytics, you can achieve this through some combination of a tag manager or processing rules, but this would only be applied going forward from when you made the change.\n\nIn CJA, using derived fields, this type of transformation is constructed in a drag-and-drop user interface and is fully retroactive and applied instantaneously. You can create your derived field by manipulating other fields within an event using a set of predefined functions and see a live update of how it affects the output. Then, publish it as a dimension or metric for immediate use across the full timeline of events contained within CJA for any user to pick up and use in their analysis. It’s an innovation that’s truly groundbreaking. Use cases that stand out include:\n\nData cleansing\n\nApplying business logic (e.g., marketing channels, product finding method, etc.)\n\nClassifications or data grouping\n\nCombining or parsing data (e.g., URL query strings)\n\nIn the modern data stack context, this feature alone significantly closes the gap in time-to-insight. Data transformations are rarely right the first time and often need to be applied to an entire dataset before an analyst can really see whether they behave as expected. This results in a lot of iterations and time wasted. With the ability to adjust transformations on the fly, fine-tune them and uncover an insight without an engineer or SQL developer, data and analytics teams can both enjoy efficiencies as a result. As a repeatable pattern, it has incredible potential power.\n\nOpportunities for Iteration\n\nAs this space matures, I expect competition to start looking at how each other are approaching the problems and adapting. For example, there is an opportunity with how CJA is currently architected. It currently requires data to be loaded into Adobe Experience Platform in the form of their JSON Schema-based XDM specification. There are a plethora of connectors to facilitate that ingest, but it’s a necessary step. To slot CJA nicely into the ideal data stack, it could connect directly to the cloud data warehouse and consume it into the CJA data model.\n\nAdditionally, those slick, fully retroactive derived fields have limits on the number of times you can apply a function to a single derived field, the number of fields you can evaluate and the number of derived fields in a connection. These limits are to be expected to keep a feature like this performant and don’t significantly impact the majority of transformations. The good news is that the full weight of Adobe’s product and engineering is behind CJA and it’s iterating quickly with new features and optimizations each month.\n\nLastly, this doesn’t replace the need for hardened and vetted data models that serve as the semantic layer for BI tools. Those are necessary for financial and business reporting that requires a higher level of rigor. Instead, CJA can relieve the strain on the teams supporting them, keep them focused on what matters, and divert many of the ad hoc, deep-dive and exploratory tasks to CJA.\n\nConclusion\n\nGoing forward, a tool like Adobe CJA has the potential to be the tip of the spear. Facilitating self-serve and immediate exploration within a purpose-built data model, consuming from the cloud. Being tuned for speed and on-the-fly transformations, it can become a complementary component of the modern data stack. It’s still in a nascent stage and has some kinks to iron out, but the move toward more rapidly visualizing and exploring data in the cloud can be the next big advancement in the field of analytics.",
      "# [Maximizing DV360's Optimized Targeting: Operational Insights and Pitfalls by Scott Kelly on 2024-01-30](https://adswerve.com/blog/mastering-dv360-optimized-targeting-best-practices-and-tips)\nIf you are an avid Display and Video 360 (DV360) user, you have likely heard of, seen or used a new feature in DV360 called “optimized targeting.” This feature is an evolution of Google's audience expansion solution, and Adswerve is here to guide you through how to use this new feature effectively.\n\nWhat is Optimized Targeting?\n\nOptimized targeting is DV360’s latest lookalike iteration that leverages Google’s machine learning. It utilizes a wide range of signals, which are also employed in Google's automated bidding process. This innovative approach helps identify incremental reach with audiences that are more likely to take the desired KPI action.\n\nWith the release of this feature, you have the opportunity to optimize your programmatic campaign’s performance by expanding your audience while optimizing toward custom performance goals without the availability of third-party cookies. (The deprecation of third-party cookies is on the horizon for 2H 2024).\n\nOptimized targeting is a powerful tool that can help reach audiences beyond your current first-party targeted segments while always working to achieve your campaign’s goals. As with any automated AI tool, it’s best to have a well-thought-out approach before you enable optimized targeting in DV360.\n\nWhether or not you’ve tested optimized targeting, below are some helpful tips and considerations to keep in mind when using the feature.\n\nBest Practices for Optimized Targeting:\n\nEnsure that you have all your necessary targeting applied to your line Items before you enable optimized targeting.\n\nReview the current setup of your line item prior to enabling optimized targeting to help avoid overspending:\n\nBe mindful of your line item’s available impressions to ensure you do not have too large of a reach.\n\nKeep in mind the size of your intended first-party audience list/s.\n\nPRO TIP: Use the “reach widget” to the right of your line Item settings to view its total reach potential prior to turning on optimized targeting. (Note: the reach widget will not take into account or reflect any increase in available impressions that optimized targeting may generate).\n\nPRO TIP: Review your audience size under the “All Audiences” tab in the advertiser view.\n\nOptimized targeting functions similarly to how automated bidding models work. Allow up to two weeks for the algorithm to learn and calibrate, as spend/performance may fluctuate when you initially turn on the feature.\n\nOptimized targeting should not exceed spend or Target CPA (tCPA) goals, although it may, in some instances due to setup. Carefully observe these line Items as the system continues to learn by pulling campaign performance reports throughout your campaign fight.\n\nGenerate a report in DV360 using the optimized targeting dimension to measure which impressions come from optimized targeting and which come from your selected segments.\n\nYes: Impressions that come from optimized targeting.\n\nNo: Impressions that come from your selected segments.\n\nNot Recommended for Optimized Targeting:\n\nImpression-based budgets: there are system limitations when using impression-based budgets and optimized targeting together.
