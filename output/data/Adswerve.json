      "# [Results | World Surf League | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/wsl)\nWorld Surf League (WSL) is a digital-first sports league by design because no one knows exactly when the wave conditions will be right. They plan events around a two-week time window at locations around the globe. When the surf is up, the competition begins. Being all-digital allows WSL to publish content fast and stream surfing events as they occur. Fans can use a mobile app to watch live broadcasts and keep up to date with their favorite WSL athletes anywhere, anytime.\n\nAfter consolidating several live events from major surfing brands onto its own video streaming platform, WSL needed better answers to questions about viewership. How many fans engage regularly? How many tune in to multiple events? Who are the superfans — the ones who drive the majority of consumption and engagement— and which new users are most likely to become superfans?\n\nTo better understand fan behavior, WSL began using Google Analytics 360 to gather data from a variety of customer touchpoints and worked with us to accelerate time to value and keep data quality high.\n\nWe combined and cleaned data from Analytics 360, Facebook and WSL’s internal system into a single data lake and modeled superfan attributes using machine learning algorithms. We then applied early engagement attributes of superfans so WSL could focus its marketing on new users.\n\nThe fan insights WSL gained using Google Analytics 360 with Google BigQuery allowed the organization to reduce cost per conversion by more than 50%, which more than doubled the efficiency of ad spend aimed at driving fan engagement and content viewership.\n\nBy focusing on higher ROI customers, WSL drives greater fan engagement with live events and digital content—without increasing its marketing budget. When weather conditions deliver the best waves and large numbers of fans are looking at content, WSL can easily scale its analytics on demand. And during the offseason, it can scale down, which has allowed it to reduce infrastructure costs by 70%.\n\nNow its team can ask more sophisticated questions of its data: How do wave conditions affect viewership? How do athletes’ scores correlate with other factors such as wave height, time of day, or level of competition? And what exactly is a superfan worth to the business?\n\nDownload the full case study.",

      "# [GTM Update: Google Tags Required for Google Ads and Floodlights By Early April by Monica Hare on 2025-03-26](https://adswerve.com/blog/april-update-google-tags-for-google-ads-and-floodlights-required-in-gtm)\nGoogle announced this month that starting April 10, 2025, Google Tag Manager containers with Google Ads tags and/or Campaign Manager Floodlight tags implemented will automatically load a Google Tag first before those tags fire. While this announcement may feel a little rushed, luckily, we’re here to help provide action items and considerations for your teams and agencies to take to prepare for this update. Read on to learn more about the update and what you can do.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nGoogle has said that the Google Tag is a prerequisite for sending events to Google services, such as GA4, Google Ads and Campaign Manager Floodlights. However, this “rule” hasn’t been enforced, in that, if you had Google Ads tags and/or Campaign Manager Floodlight tags in your GTM container and didn’t have an associated Google Tag with each, your data wasn’t adversely affected.\n\nNot so for GA4 users – If your GA4 Google Tag didn’t fire before your GA4 event tags, you would see rather severe data attribution issues. But that wasn’t the case for Google Ads or Floodlights tag data in those platforms.\n\nUntil now. For those platforms, the associated Google Tag will have the same benefits as it does for GA4: Improve data quality, improve conversion attribution and provide more control over data collection settings. To take advantage of those benefits, it is necessary to fire that Google Tag before any Google Ads and/or Floodlight event tags in GTM.\n\nIf you don’t have a Google Tag implemented in your GTM container to fire before your Google Ads tags, or likewise with CM Floodlights, Google will automatically fire a Google Tag for them before those tags fire.\n\nWhat you can do.\n\nWe recommend implementing the Google Tag(s) for these platforms rather than waiting for the automation solution so that you have more control over the data collection and tag behavior.\n\nSteps to prepare:\n\n1. Check your GTM container for an update in the Container diagnostics banner referring to Missing Google tags.\n\n2. When you click Add Google Tags, you’re given the predefined Google Tags with the correct Measurement ID and trigger of Initialization - All Pages. The GTM user will need to click through the tags to confirm that the Google Ads measurement IDs (AW-xxxxx) and/or the Floodlight measurement IDs (DC-xxxxxx) are correct.\n\n3. These tags aren’t automatically added and published; the GTM user will need to add the changes to the Workspace, and then publish.\n\n4. Update complete!\n\nNot quite. There are a number of considerations to keep in mind and review before these new Google Tag(s) are published in your GTM container.\n\nConsiderations\n\nOne of the benefits of implementing a Google Tag for Google Ads and Floodlights is more control over data collection settings. One of these settings is “Allow user-provided data capabilities,” where you configure whether your Google Tag should allow user-provided data to be included in measurement.\n\n(Google Ads Google Tag configuration)\n\nIn order to take advantage of this feature, the platform user would need to accept the Google Terms of Service for User-Provided Data, enable the feature in the Google Tag settings in the platform, and then check the “Include user-provided data from your website” option in the individual Google Ads or Floodlight tags, as well as in the individual Floodlights Enhanced Conversions option in platform.\n\n(Campaign Manager Floodlight tag in Google Tag Manager)\n\n(Floodlight settings in Campaign Manager)\n\nIn addition, your legal team will need to review this feature, what data it collects and how it is collected, as your user data privacy policy will need to be updated if this is enabled.\n\nWe recommend reviewing the Google Tag settings and GTM tag settings to confirm this feature is not enabled if you do not have all of the privacy requirements and TOS accepted prior to publishing the new Google Tags.\n\nAnother important consideration is data privacy rules compliance. The predefined Google Tags have the Measurement ID input and the trigger attached, but they are not compliant with data privacy laws such as CPRA or GDPR as is.\n\nBefore publishing, you should review with your legal team what cookie categorization these Google Tags would fall under, and then apply the appropriate blocking triggers for that category. So if a user opts out of that category on your site, i.e., they don’t want to be tracked by marketing campaigns, then the Google Tag won't fire.\n\nThese considerations will mean a lot of communication among many teams, internally and externally to be compliant when these Google Tags are published or if you choose to use Google’s automation.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nI already have a Google Tag for GA4 in my GTM container, why do I need another one (or two)?\n\nGoogle Tags have a field for Measurement ID, where they send data to that specific Google platform. You cannot combine Google Tags in GTM for multiple platforms. It is possible to do this in Google Tag settings, but we recommend separate Google Tags for separate platforms. In this case, that would be one for GA4, one for Google Ads and one for Floodlights.\n\nDoes this affect my GA4 Google Tag or my GA4 event tags in GTM?\n\nNo, this update is only for Google Ads and Floodlight tags in GTM.\n\nIf I do nothing, what happens?\n\nGoogle will automatically send a Google Tag before any of your Google Ads or Floodlight tags fire. It’s not an option you turn on or configure, it will be done automatically. We recommend manually adding the Google Tags to have more control over the settings and tag behavior.",

      "# [The Latest on PMax: Greater Control, Smarter Insights by Kaysen Jacobelli on 2025-02-25](https://adswerve.com/blog/the-latest-on-pmax-greater-control-smarter-insights)\nSince the full rollout of Performance Max (PMax) campaigns in 2022, advertisers have loved the tool’s versatility but felt a bit sidelined by its AI-driven automation. Google heard your feedback and is stepping up in 2025 to put even more control in your hands. New features are on the way that will allow you to fine-tune your PMax campaigns like never before, helping you keep up the strong results while steering your campaigns in the direction that matters most to you.\n\nThese updates include powerful new tools that boost control, improve reporting and provide more transparency — and this is just the beginning.\n\nAs with most feature rollouts, these updates will first be available for testing in Google Ads and then expand to Search Ads 360 (SA360). In the meantime, SA360 will respect the PMax configurations set in Google Ads.\n\nNow, let’s dive into what’s new and how these updates can supercharge your campaigns to start the year strong.\n\nTake the Driver’s Seat: More Ways to Guide AI\n\nAs advertising enters the Generative AI era, maintaining control will be crucial to building a balanced partnership. With the rollout of these new features for PMax, Google is empowering advertisers to begin \"Automation Layering.\" This concept introduces a blend of manual and automated tools that set boundaries for AI, allowing it to operate with the flexibility it needs to perform, while keeping you — the expert — behind the wheel.\n\nSmarter Targeting & Campaign Control\n\nSoon, advertisers will be able to fine-tune their Performance Max campaigns as Google introduces:\n\nCampaign-level negative keywords (Beta)\n\nMore control over new customer acquisition\n\nBrand exclusions by format\n\n“URL contains” rules for campaigns with product feeds\n\nDemographic exclusions (Beta)\n\nDevice targeting (Beta)\n\nTake Control of Negative Keywords\n\nAfter months of gathering feedback on the current negative keyword configuration process, Google is finally rolling out campaign-level negative keyword controls for Pmax. This update allows advertisers to bypass support chats and manual requests, giving them the ability to manage negative keywords for Pmax campaigns directly within the Google Ads UI. This long-awaited feature streamlines campaign management, making it easier than ever to exclude irrelevant queries on your own terms, in real time.\n\nMaximizing High-Value Customer Acquisition\n\nLast year, Google introduced a beta feature for new customer acquisition goals designed specifically to target high-value new customers. This feature has now been fully released and is available to all advertisers.\n\nWith the high-value acquisition goal, you can define what constitutes a high-value customer based on their long-term value using Customer Match. Leveraging Google AI and your first-party data, the system predicts new users with the highest potential lifetime value (LTV) for your brand and adjusts bids accordingly to maximize their acquisition.\n\nMore Flexible Brand Exclusions in Product Feeds\n\nAdvertisers can now exclude specific brands from Search ads while still including them in Shopping campaigns. In the past, brand exclusions in PMax affected both types of ads, which restricted flexibility. This new update enhances control over budget and messaging, all while maintaining the ability to attract high-intent branded traffic in Shopping ads.\n\nRefining Performance With URL-Based Targeting\n\nIf your campaigns rely on product feeds, PMax now supports \"URL contains\" rules to help advertisers target specific sections of their site.\n\nUpcoming Betas for Improved Targeting Functions\n\nTwo exciting betas are set to launch for PMax. The first is a demographic beta that enables the exclusion of specific age groups, like \"18-24\" or \"65+.\" The second is a device targeting beta that facilitates customized targeting based on traffic from desktop, mobile devices or tablets.\n\nAsset Group Reporting: More Granular Insights, Now Downloadable\n\nCampaign performance is about more than just the big picture; it’s about understanding how different assets contribute to conversions. That’s why Google is introducing:\n\nAsset group segmentation: Analyze conversions by device, time of day and other key factors.\n\nDownloadable asset group performance reports: Share and analyze outside the Google Ads UI.\n\nThese features allow you to track and refine specific creative elements, ensuring that your best-performing assets get the visibility they deserve.\n\nWant to Take Control Today?\n\nIn addition to the new built-in features rolling out this year, Adswerve can help you create an out-of-the-box solution to optimize your campaigns.

      "# Post ID 14x7g7d: Is there a way to view GA4 events in the Chrome Developer Tools? with +1 score by [(maestro_man, Reddit, 2023-07-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleAnalytics/comments/14x7g7d/is_there_a_way_to_view_ga4_events_in_the_chrome/)\nHowdy! I'm a frontend dev working for an agency and a number of clients, and as would be expected, we are now beginning to implement a lot more custom metrics in GA4. \n\nMy question is: Assuming we do *not* have access to the GA4 dashboard/login itself, is there a way I can view GA4 events in the Chrome Dev Tools? For UA events, I could look at the \\`collect\\` calls in the Network tab, or I could use the \"Google Analytics Debugger\" Chrome extension and see logs in the console. I've tried the \"Debugger for Google Analytics 4\" extension and am having no luck, or mixed luck at best (not seeing any custom metrics at all, but some page view events and whatnot). \n\nAny help or insight would be greatly appreciated! Cheers!\n\n\n\n## Comment ID jrm2j6g with +4 score by [(Falcon_nz, Reddit, 2023-07-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleAnalytics/comments/14x7g7d/is_there_a_way_to_view_ga4_events_in_the_chrome/jrm2j6g/) (in reply to ID 14x7g7d):\nI use ga4 debugger extension\n\n### Comment ID kqiho9m with +1 score by [(Frequent_Meeting_743, Reddit, 2024-02-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleAnalytics/comments/14x7g7d/is_there_a_way_to_view_ga4_events_in_the_chrome/kqiho9m/) (in reply to ID jrm2j6g):\nI don't want to use any extension.

Have never used this tool. This could be something to explore. As I mentioned elsewhere, it's more of a workflow issue, as I'd love for something to log right in my face or in the console as I click around a site to check buttons, links, add to carts, etc. This is intriguing and I'll def give it a proper look, but the idea of having to open up this additional window in a fresh incognito window (when I'm testing changes) in order to see events in a separate tab feels a little clunky. Will 100% give it a run, though!

The issue is more around workflow. I work with a lot of ecommerce companies, so I'm checking a lot of custom metrics on button/link clicks, modals opening, adds to cart, etc., and having these actions logged out in front of me as I click around the site would be ideal. Also, I won't be able to check the dataLayer if a link click navigates me away from the current page (unless the link allows me to cmd+click to open a new tab, but that's still annoying). May toy with writing my own little solution to leverage the dataLayer.\n\nAlso not seeing any GA4 calls in the Network tab filtered by \"google\" or the measurement ID. :shrug:\n\nI'm still learning, so I may totally be screwing something up haha!

That would help narrow the scope. \n\nMost of the \\*good\\* DSPs have minimums of some sort, whether that is the monthly or annual spend commitment, or minimum per buy. All of the ones you listed have fairly hefty annual commitments, but are mostly recognized as being in the upper class of DSPs in terms of features, inventory, and integrations (DV360 and TTD usually at the very top of that list, as well as for cost.) Others worth mentioning in this class are Basis and Adobe Ad Cloud -- both require commitments. If you can justify an annual commitment of $250k, you can get in the door with Basis, MediaMath, maybe Xandr? \n\nSome of the DSPs have resellers, who can hook you up with a seat without the monstrous commitment. There are a number of them for DV360, but you still need to be spending quite a bit per month to justify it. \n\nA few other lower tier DSPs can still get you a lot of what you want -- depending on what your requirements are. There's always Google Ads as the default -- this gets you display and YouTube. \n\nI really like StackAdapt. No commitments, but is fully featured in a nice UI. Lots of integrations with other platforms. Display, video, native. \n\nPontiac Media is a pretty solid offering. The UI isn't great, but the tech underneath is built upon Xandr, so is fairly robust. It has a small monthly fee of like $25 if you aren't actively spending anything, but otherwise no commitment.\n\n### Comment ID jm8jljf with +5 score by [(doug_kaplan, Reddit, 2023-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/13vw8sy/best_entry_level_dsp/jm8jljf/) (in reply to ID jm8hxcs):\nI second StackAdapt, no minimum monthly spend and no contract so makes it easy to dip your toes in or leave with ease and is fairly full featured.\n\n### Comment ID jmb49lb with +1 score by [(MirsadZ, Reddit, 2023-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/13vw8sy/best_entry_level_dsp/jmb49lb/) (in reply to ID jm8hxcs):\nThanks so much for the detailed explanation.\nFor context we still don't know the exact budget.

Server-side is great, but it has some limitations. The implementations I've seen all involve double tagging. One set for standard web and another for server-side. Separate ID's.\n\nIt's really your call whether you want to have server-side sending data to a separate measurement ID than the standard web tag, or only have server-side send data to GA4.\n\nYou need to make sure your GA4 configuration tag fires before any other GA4 tags. Google say to fire the config tag using the \"initialization\" trigger, but you can also use tag sequencing on the other GA4 tags to always run the config tag first.\n\nThe measurement ID in your config tag (the one that sends data to server-side) is irrelevant, unless you choose to pass it through from server-side.\n\nI don't. I send a dummy measurement ID and I set the measurement ID myself in the sGTM container.\n\n\"Google Signals\" is apparently not compatible with server-side, so if you want GA4 audience building, you will still need a data stream collecting data using the standard web tag.\n\n### Comment ID ixqrnpt with +3 score by [(Swiss_Mike, Reddit, 2022-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/z4ahh0/serverside_ga4_implementation_question/ixqrnpt/) (in reply to ID ixqgy20):\nThank you for taking the time in responding!

However, Cliniko has made it difficult to track user's sales conversion whenever a booking is made on our website. Once a booking is made, the page does not reload or redirect to a confirmation page as everything happens within the iframe.\n\n  \nUpon further investigation, we found out that Cliniko blacklisted Google Analytics due to the UK-EU GDPR laws. We, therefore, need to create a workaround, which has partially been made by inserting a listening event script on the page, which is then picked up on Google Tag Manager.\n\n  \nHowever, the issue with that is that we have no way of tracking what service was booked and how much it was. This would pose a problem as we'd be unable to identify how much a campaign has generated in sales conversion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nlet me know if you have any know solution to this headache i'm having. \n\n\n\n## Comment ID lz5juoh with +1 score by [(Alert-Look-8363, Reddit, 2024-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/180xbte/iframe_conversion_tracking_workaround/lz5juoh/) (in reply to ID 180xbte):\nDid you manage to find a solution to this?

Then listening for changes in the 'parent' browser dataLayer. So it would not be an issue of blocking Google Analytics. Could it be that Cliniko is blocking either the postMessage method or maybe Javascript entirely?\n\n## Comment ID kaz1qob with +1 score by [(StefanAtWork, Reddit, 2023-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/180xbte/iframe_conversion_tracking_workaround/kaz1qob/) (in reply to ID 180xbte):\nIf you want to see a real-world implementation of Iframe tracking, see [https://www.theritzlondon.com/](https://www.theritzlondon.com/) and go to the \"Dine With Us\" option and click into e.g. \"The Ritz Restaurant\".\n\nThe Iframe embed contains its own GTM container we were allowed to place there by the booking service provider [www.sevenrooms.com](https://www.sevenrooms.com)\n\nThe GTM container hosts a single Custom HTML tag (fired on All Pages) and that tag was built using the info here: [https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/cookieless-tracking-cross-site-iframes/](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/cookieless-tracking-cross-site-iframes/)\n\nIf you have a suitable debugging extension (AdSwerve dataLayer Inspector+ is great), you'll easily be able to see the events being sent from the Iframe to the \"parent\" GTM, as they are all prefixed with `sriframe.`\n\nThere are still limitations. In this instance Sevenrooms have taken steps to block Click events from firing, so the only events that can be tracked are those created by the booking system itself.\n\n### Comment ID kcdsf5l with +1 score by [(Beneficial_Egg_5465, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/180xbte/iframe_conversion_tracking_workaround/kcdsf5l/) (in reply to ID kaz1qob):\nI have a similar issue with a booking platform called Vagaro.

So, here are a few things I would try.\n\n- Make sure there isn't anything blocking the firing of GA4, like deferring the JS load or any other site speed attempts. I've seen this happen where it'll track during my testing and all default GA4 events fire, but my custom stuff doesn't. \n\n- Really odd and depends on the site/CMS, but clear any cache on the site as well. You'd think it shouldn't matter since you are using GTM, but I was able to resolve a similar issue by flushing the cache in the CMS. Odd for sure, but it worked. \n\n- If you are talking about \"key events/conversions,\" you need to actually toggle those on. but if they are not firing to begin with, that's a bit more challenging.\n\n- Really, really small thing (but I've done it before, especially if you are working with a large amount of sites), double check that the GA4 ID you have in GTM matches the account you except them to be under. Like I said, small, but we've all done that from time to time.\n\nHope that helps and good luck!\n\n## Comment ID lfo5unm with +2 score by [(CO_PC_Parts, Reddit, 2024-07-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/1efqipk/events_from_gtm_not_showing_in_the_ga4_reports/lfo5unm/) (in reply to ID 1efqipk):\nDid you publish the gtm container?

Lots of third-hand feedback delivered through your boss because people are too cowardly to say what's on their mind. \n-Clueless, unaccountable leadership: Company touts that they didn't lay anyone off during the pandemic, then lays off 5% of the company last year, then continues to tout that they didn't lay anyone off!\n-Backstabbing Culture: No one is willing to deliver DIRECT feedback. Get used to having someone talk to your boss about you! It squashes any attempt at asking for help out of fear that someone will perceive it as weakness, resulting in termination. \n-High turnover: People disappear under \"suspicious circumstances\" (often at terrible times for client and project health). Executives are not exempt from this either. The company lost their COO and chief salesperson recently, then worked to spin their departure as a coincidence instead of a reflection of the company. Womp womp. \n-Inconsistent and contradictory goal requirements: There is no incentive to do strategic work that could make the company better when all of the company's goals and OKRs are about sales and billable time. Templates for docs like SOWs and legal-approved contracts desperately need overhauling, but no one has time or bandwidth to work on those tasks over client work. \n-Awful clients: Adswerve lives off its relationships with companies like Google and Adobe, so they often get the dregs that can't or won't pay for a real consulting firm. \n-Sneaky HR Practices: I've never heard of a company treating cost-of-living increases as \"merit\" increases. This is insulting, especially during a time of record inflation.",

I also need to call out the blatantly fake review left on 11/16/24 titled “Great company.” It’s obvious this was written by executives to boost ratings. If you’re going to resort to leaving fake reviews, at least put some effort into making them believable.\n\nOver the past year, the organization has drastically declined, losing any redeeming qualities it once had. The people-first culture we prided ourselves on is now completely absent.\n\nDespite claiming a lack of budget for promotions, leadership decided to allocate funds toward a poorly executed summit. This event was not only meaningless and cheaply run but also a blatant misallocation of resources. The money spent on the summit could have been used for employee bonuses or well-deserved promotions. Instead, it became a waste of time and a demoralizing reminder for employees who were told promotions weren’t feasible due to budget constraints.\n\nMedia leadership implemented one of the most poorly planned and executed reorgs, and the fallout has affected everyone. Morale is at an all-time low, employees are stretched impossibly thin, and micromanagement has become the norm. While reorgs are rarely perfect, this one was carelessly conceived and disastrously implemented, with employees left to bear the brunt of its failure. Many were reassigned to new roles without clarity or job descriptions—an unethical move that created confusion and resentment. Others were left juggling both their previous responsibilities and new, undefined workloads.\n\nTo make matters worse, a major KPI was retroactively increased four months into the year. This left employees scrambling not only to hit an increased target going forward but also to make up for the gap retroactively. The decision lacked fairness, foresight, and consideration\n\nWhile the department’s employees continue to support one another, senior leaders and executives should be deeply ashamed of their actions. Their decisions have left employees overworked, undervalued, and utterly demoralized. \n\nPay is below market rate, leadership is reckless, morale is low, and growth opportunities are scarce.",

If an employee isn’t able to fulfill billable hours due to things outside of their control, offer a different avenue where they can feel recognized for their achievements.",

This is only a small issue compared to the bigger issue below which is focused around gaining job experience and growth. \n\n- Extremely slow to grow from an entry-level standpoint and KPI’s for billable hours (1300 per year which isn’t a lot) unable to be met. This is mostly due to a combination of bottleneck in client work (not enough to go around) as well as preference for skilled workers to be put on client work opposed to ones that don’t have much experience. My feedback here would be to allow the hire to shadow these working sessions and maybe even get them involved in some way so that the opportunity for growth is still there. \n\nThey don’t necessarily have to bill the client for it; but it’ll help facilitate learning as opposed to just being shut out of projects due to lack of skill and being placed on the back burner.\n\n- Sometimes, leadership will have disagreements in what feedback they give to an employee. A director will say one thing whilst approaching employee separately without manager, and a manager will say another in a separate meeting. It’s hard to tell what exactly leadership wants.",

As you grow within the company hard work is generously rewarded with regular raises and bonuses.  The success of the company is shared with all employees, which is a pretty rare thing these days.  \r\n\r\nWork life balance is a big deal and while an especially busy time or a unique circumstance might have you checking in on something in the evening or on a weekend there's an expectation to leave your work at the office and enjoy your life.  Full-time means 40 hours, which is rare in a lot of agencies where this can be seen as more of a 'starting place'.\r\n\r\nThe holiday parties are a blast, snacks and drinks are provided, ping pong and Nintendo during the slower times.",

Full-time means 40 hours, which is rare in a lot of agencies where this can be seen as more of a 'starting place'.\r\n\r\nThe holiday parties are a blast, snacks and drinks are provided, ping pong and Nintendo during the slower times.",

Good luck trying to figure out a plan now that you’ve overburdened your employees and caused us to lose trust .",
        "cons": "If I could, I would give this organization zero stars. I also need to call out the blatantly fake review left on 11/16/24 titled “Great company.” It’s obvious this was written by executives to boost ratings. If you’re going to resort to leaving fake reviews, at least put some effort into making them believable.\n\nOver the past year, the organization has drastically declined, losing any redeeming qualities it once had. The people-first culture we prided ourselves on is now completely absent.\n\nDespite claiming a lack of budget for promotions, leadership decided to allocate funds toward a poorly executed summit. This event was not only meaningless and cheaply run but also a blatant misallocation of resources. The money spent on the summit could have been used for employee bonuses or well-deserved promotions. Instead, it became a waste of time and a demoralizing reminder for employees who were told promotions weren’t feasible due to budget constraints.\n\nMedia leadership implemented one of the most poorly planned and executed reorgs, and the fallout has affected everyone. Morale is at an all-time low, employees are stretched impossibly thin, and micromanagement has become the norm. While reorgs are rarely perfect, this one was carelessly conceived and disastrously implemented, with employees left to bear the brunt of its failure. Many were reassigned to new roles without clarity or job descriptions—an unethical move that created confusion and resentment. Others were left juggling both their previous responsibilities and new, undefined workloads.\n\nTo make matters worse, a major KPI was retroactively increased four months into the year. This left employees scrambling not only to hit an increased target going forward but also to make up for the gap retroactively. The decision lacked fairness, foresight, and consideration\n\nWhile the department’s employees continue to support one another, senior leaders and executives should be deeply ashamed of their actions. Their decisions have left employees overworked, undervalued, and utterly demoralized. \n\nPay is below market rate, leadership is reckless, morale is low, and growth opportunities are scarce.",

      "# [GTM Update: Google Tags Required for Google Ads and Floodlights By Early April by Monica Hare on 2025-03-26](https://adswerve.com/blog/april-update-google-tags-for-google-ads-and-floodlights-required-in-gtm)\nGoogle announced this month that starting April 10, 2025, Google Tag Manager containers with Google Ads tags and/or Campaign Manager Floodlight tags implemented will automatically load a Google Tag first before those tags fire. While this announcement may feel a little rushed, luckily, we’re here to help provide action items and considerations for your teams and agencies to take to prepare for this update. Read on to learn more about the update and what you can do.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nGoogle has said that the Google Tag is a prerequisite for sending events to Google services, such as GA4, Google Ads and Campaign Manager Floodlights. However, this “rule” hasn’t been enforced, in that, if you had Google Ads tags and/or Campaign Manager Floodlight tags in your GTM container and didn’t have an associated Google Tag with each, your data wasn’t adversely affected.\n\nNot so for GA4 users – If your GA4 Google Tag didn’t fire before your GA4 event tags, you would see rather severe data attribution issues. But that wasn’t the case for Google Ads or Floodlights tag data in those platforms.\n\nUntil now. For those platforms, the associated Google Tag will have the same benefits as it does for GA4: Improve data quality, improve conversion attribution and provide more control over data collection settings. To take advantage of those benefits, it is necessary to fire that Google Tag before any Google Ads and/or Floodlight event tags in GTM.\n\nIf you don’t have a Google Tag implemented in your GTM container to fire before your Google Ads tags, or likewise with CM Floodlights, Google will automatically fire a Google Tag for them before those tags fire.\n\nWhat you can do.\n\nWe recommend implementing the Google Tag(s) for these platforms rather than waiting for the automation solution so that you have more control over the data collection and tag behavior.\n\nSteps to prepare:\n\n1. Check your GTM container for an update in the Container diagnostics banner referring to Missing Google tags.\n\n2. When you click Add Google Tags, you’re given the predefined Google Tags with the correct Measurement ID and trigger of Initialization - All Pages. The GTM user will need to click through the tags to confirm that the Google Ads measurement IDs (AW-xxxxx) and/or the Floodlight measurement IDs (DC-xxxxxx) are correct.\n\n3. These tags aren’t automatically added and published; the GTM user will need to add the changes to the Workspace, and then publish.\n\n4. Update complete!\n\nNot quite. There are a number of considerations to keep in mind and review before these new Google Tag(s) are published in your GTM container.\n\nConsiderations\n\nOne of the benefits of implementing a Google Tag for Google Ads and Floodlights is more control over data collection settings. One of these settings is “Allow user-provided data capabilities,” where you configure whether your Google Tag should allow user-provided data to be included in measurement.\n\n(Google Ads Google Tag configuration)\n\nIn order to take advantage of this feature, the platform user would need to accept the Google Terms of Service for User-Provided Data, enable the feature in the Google Tag settings in the platform, and then check the “Include user-provided data from your website” option in the individual Google Ads or Floodlight tags, as well as in the individual Floodlights Enhanced Conversions option in platform.\n\n(Campaign Manager Floodlight tag in Google Tag Manager)\n\n(Floodlight settings in Campaign Manager)\n\nIn addition, your legal team will need to review this feature, what data it collects and how it is collected, as your user data privacy policy will need to be updated if this is enabled.\n\nWe recommend reviewing the Google Tag settings and GTM tag settings to confirm this feature is not enabled if you do not have all of the privacy requirements and TOS accepted prior to publishing the new Google Tags.\n\nAnother important consideration is data privacy rules compliance. The predefined Google Tags have the Measurement ID input and the trigger attached, but they are not compliant with data privacy laws such as CPRA or GDPR as is.\n\nBefore publishing, you should review with your legal team what cookie categorization these Google Tags would fall under, and then apply the appropriate blocking triggers for that category. So if a user opts out of that category on your site, i.e., they don’t want to be tracked by marketing campaigns, then the Google Tag won't fire.\n\nThese considerations will mean a lot of communication among many teams, internally and externally to be compliant when these Google Tags are published or if you choose to use Google’s automation.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nI already have a Google Tag for GA4 in my GTM container, why do I need another one (or two)?\n\nGoogle Tags have a field for Measurement ID, where they send data to that specific Google platform. You cannot combine Google Tags in GTM for multiple platforms. It is possible to do this in Google Tag settings, but we recommend separate Google Tags for separate platforms. In this case, that would be one for GA4, one for Google Ads and one for Floodlights.\n\nDoes this affect my GA4 Google Tag or my GA4 event tags in GTM?\n\nNo, this update is only for Google Ads and Floodlight tags in GTM.\n\nIf I do nothing, what happens?\n\nGoogle will automatically send a Google Tag before any of your Google Ads or Floodlight tags fire. It’s not an option you turn on or configure, it will be done automatically. We recommend manually adding the Google Tags to have more control over the settings and tag behavior.",

      "# [Third-Party Cookie Delay: A Reprieve, Not a Respite for Marketers on 2024-04-25](https://adswerve.com/blog/third-party-cookie-delay-a-reprieve-not-a-respite-for-marketers)\nGoogle has pushed back the end of third-party cookies (3PC) in Chrome yet again, with a new target of early 2025. This news offers a sigh of relief for some, but it's crucial to remember this is a delay and not a cancellation. Let's unpack what this means for the industry, and how you can make the most of this reprieve using the additional resources provided below.\n\nA Shifting Timeline\n\nRemember when 2020 was supposed to be the year of the 3PC apocalypse? The industry spoke, and Google listened. Here's the revised timeline:\n\nJanuary 2020: Google initially announced plans to phase out 3PC within two years.\n\nFebruary 2022: The first delay hit, with the sunset pushed to late 2023.\n\nJanuary 2024: The timeline shifted again, targeting a mid-2024 deprecation.\n\nApril 2024: Google’s most recent update places the official end date in early 2025.\n\nWhy the Delay?\n\nTwo key factors contributed to Google's decision:\n\nIndustry Concerns: Marketers and developers expressed a need for more time to adapt and explore alternatives. Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative, designed to replace 3PC tracking, needed further refinement.\n\nRegulatory Scrutiny: Antitrust investigations, particularly from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), prompted Google to address competition concerns before completely phasing out 3PC.\n\nWhat This Means for the Privacy Sandbox Initiatives\n\nWhile the phase-out of third-party cookies (3PC) has been pushed back to early 2025, most initiatives within the Privacy Sandbox, including the Topics API, Protected Audience API and Attribution Reporting API, are still on track for a Q3 2024 rollout.\n\nTesting Time Extended: The delay offers valuable extra time for developers and testers to refine Privacy Sandbox solutions within Chrome. This translates to potentially smoother functionality and a more seamless transition for advertisers when 3PC finally sunsets. Solutions in development include:\n\nEnhanced Cohort Targeting: Refining how advertisers target audience segments based on similar interests or browsing behaviors without relying on individual user identifiers.\n\nImproved Contextual Targeting: Testing methods for analyzing the context of webpages and content to deliver relevant ads without user tracking.\n\nPrivacy-Preserving Attribution: Developing solutions that accurately measure campaign effectiveness while upholding user privacy standards.\n\nIntegration Focus: Expect continued development on integrating these Sandbox solutions with Google Marketing Platform (GMP) products like Display & Video 360 (DV360) and Campaign Manager 360 (CM360). This will ensure a streamlined workflow for managing campaigns after 3PC deprecation.\n\nAddressing Industry Feedback: Google can use the additional time to incorporate valuable industry feedback. This could lead to increased transparency around how the Sandbox works, more open collaboration with stakeholders and potential adjustments to features based on advertiser needs.\n\nBonus time for website owners:\n\nThe delay also offers an advantage for website owners. Here are two proposals where you can take action:\n\nRelated Website Sets (RWS): Do you have a company with websites on multiple domains (e.g., brandx.com and fly-brandx.com) or domains for different countries (such as example.com, example.rs, example.uk, etc.)? RWS lets these sites share cookies. With the delay, you have more time to submit your domains for approval within RWS. Pro Tip: Make sure your domains meet the RWS guidelines before Q3 2024.\n\nCHIPS (SameSite=Lax for Cookies with Partitioned Storage): Do you use embedded services like chat widgets? CHIPS allows these services to use cookies with your main website. The extra time allows you to test and implement CHIPS if it works for your website.\n\n“While 2025 is now the official 3PC end date, acting now is the smart move. At Adswerve, we’re constantly testing solutions that will work best for advertisers and website owners while prioritizing user privacy. We’re also aggressively exploring Privacy Sandbox initiatives and finding ways to best utilize those solutions for our clients. The time for complacency is over; let’s get to work.”\n\n- Luka Cempre, Senior Data Scientist\n\nWhat This Means for Marketers\n\nMore Time to Adapt: This delay offers a valuable window to test and refine cookieless marketing strategies. Focus on collecting first-party (1P) data directly from your users. Integrate this with data from your own systems (like your CMS) to create a powerful, unified customer picture. Leverage user modeling and contextual targeting to deliver relevant experiences, and explore alternative identifiers to enhance your reach.\n\nUrgency Still Exists: While the deadline shifts, the cookieless future is inevitable. Don't get complacent. Prioritize building a sustainable, privacy-first marketing approach.\n\n“The viability of 3PC has been degrading for years. The playbook for how to respond is the same today as it was before this delay. Marketers should continue moving ahead with their plans as if 3rd party cookies are already gone.”\n\n- Jake Winter, Principal Lead\n\nWhat This Means for Agencies\n\nUpskilling Opportunity: Invest in training your team on cookieless solutions, data privacy regulations and alternative targeting methods.\n\nClient Education Is Key: Guide your clients through the upcoming changes and their impact on campaigns.\n\nNew Revenue Streams Emerge: Expertise in 1P data and privacy-compliant measurement can be a valuable asset for agencies.\n\n“Time is a finite thing, and I implore our agency partners to look at the extra time as an opportunity to focus on actioning the long-term plans that pertain to cookie deprecation rather than short-term fixes. Agencies should continue working with their clients to test and learn durable cookieless solutions, so they have more concrete and proven strategies in place when the deadline comes. Keep pushing forward; 2025 will be here faster than we think.”- Kelly Hayes, Director of Account Management, Agency\n\nWhat This Means for The Google Marketing Platform (GMP)\n\nFocus on Privacy Sandbox: Expect to see continued development and testing of Privacy Sandbox integrations within DV360, CM360 and other platforms. These solutions will leverage technologies like Conversion Domains and Floodlight Conversion Categories to help you reach your target audiences effectively while respecting user privacy.\n\n1P Data Takes Center Stage: Look for further development of tools within GMP to streamline 1P data collection and campaign integration. Focus on collaborating with internal teams to gather as much 1P data as possible and leverage GMP for seamless data utilization.\n\nGA4 Remains Central: Expect ongoing development of GA4's functionalities for collecting and analyzing privacy-compliant data. Use the extended timeframe to test and refine existing workflows and explore new possibilities within GA4, including:\n\nSetting up GA4 for media measurement.\n\nEstablishing audience segmentation strategies.\n\nConfiguring BigQuery data exports.\n\nImplementing event-based bidding tactics.\n\n“The net result is unaffected. We were just given a little gift of being able to connect and align more between upcoming Summer PTOs and hectic calendars. We have the opportunity to feel a little less anxious, but media and analytics teams shouldn’t cancel 3PCD-related items like team meetings, roadmap developments or strategy change approvals. Instead, use the given time to double down and really think about what GMP strategies will be the best suited for your goals and needs, rather than rushing to accomplish a baseline ‘good enough’ because there wasn’t enough time.\"\n\n- Mary Kotara, Lead Consultant, Media\n\n“Cookies will live on into 2025, but focusing on your 3PCD readiness shouldn’t change. Taking actionable steps within the respective GMP platforms, dialing in your 1P data strategy and shaping your overall mindset to make sure you’re prepared should remain top priorities.”\n\n- Jeff Collins, Associate Director, Media Activation\n\nA Final Note\n\nWhile Google extends the timeline for phasing out 3PC, it's important to remember that other browsers like Safari and Firefox have already blocked 3PC. Use this delay to your advantage — experiment, build a strong data foundation and emerge from this shift stronger than ever.\n\nDon't wait until the very last minute — the future is now, and it's privacy-focused.\n\n\"This delay gives the industry a brief reprieve, but it doesn’t mean you should slow down or sideline any efforts you have in development. Anything done now to build a 1P data strategy is only going to get you further ahead of the curve!\"\n\n- Lars von Sneidern, Sr. Director of Analytics / Services Product Manager\n\nNeed help developing and executing your strategy for 3PC deprecation?

      "# [Unlocking The Power of First-Party Data: Future-Proof Solutions in CM360, GA4 and the GMP by Mary Kotara on 2024-08-22](https://adswerve.com/blog/future-proof-your-marketing-leveraging-first-party-data-solutions-in-cm360-ga4-and-gmp)\nThe future of Google’s Chrome browser will now focus on user control rather than user privacy — and the Google Marketing Plattform (GMP) is well-positioned to help. It offers durable solutions for brands and agencies to dive into first-party (1P) data opportunities for any media campaign.\n\nThe power of the GMP comes from its strength in solidifying two critical elements in a privacy-first initiative: audience segmentation and conversion attribution. These elements are integral to driving campaign success and directly influencing key objectives like awareness, retention and brand adoption.\n\nBy solidifying 1P solutions to accurately segment your audience and attribute conversions, you can durably create more personalized and relevant experiences that resonate with your audience, thereby enhancing brand loyalty and long-term growth. Let’s take a closer look at what this looks like in the GMP.\n\nCampaign Manager 360 is your 1P data media hub\n\nDue to the power of its measurement data — and connection to the GMP — Campaign Manager 360 (CM360) plays a critical role in your media campaigns. CM360 is an invaluable platform for media buyers to traffic ad tags across multiple publishers while leveraging a single source of truth through its floodlight capabilities. And Google continues to release new CM360 features to drive cost savings, workflow efficiencies and data alignment, like:\n\nFloodlight creation for conversion pixels or audience creation\n\nDirect integrations with third-party (3P) measurement vendors, Google Analytics 4 (GA4), and Google Tag Manager (GTM)\n\nThis includes Consent Mode compatibility!\n\nInstant Reporting to glean data insights immediately, including the ability to pivot, filter and apply conditional formatting\n\nConversion domain bulk editing Cross-device CTV measurement, including YouTube\n\nThe future of CM360 includes strong connections with the GMP, Chrome's Privacy Sandbox and industry APIs to drive automation, data integrations and data reliability during a time when users have more control over their data usage, making the industry more fragmented and modeled.\n\nCM360 simplifies and prepares your campaigns for privacy-safe enablement by giving you:\n\nWays to connect with GA4 for Floodlight linkage\n\nOffline Conversions API for audiences and conversion measurement\n\nEnhanced Conversions enablement\n\nConversion modeling\n\nAutomatic UserID redaction and gTag formatting\n\nNote: Read more on Adswerve’s stance on Google’s latest news.\n\nGoogle Analytics 4 can help, too\n\nA brand’s web and app data is an additional slab in the foundation of durable 1P data that easily connects to digital environments. GA4 is one of the main platforms brands lean on. It serves as a central hub for analytics teams, as CM360 does for media teams, and is a valuable addition to your stack. GA4 seamlessly integrates with CM360 for floodlights, Display & Video 360 (DV360) for audiences and bidding, and Search Ads 360 (SA360) for reporting and bidding.\n\nThese integrations also support your audience segmentation and conversion attribution strategies, enabling 1P data targeting, suppression, and expansion within media campaigns. They also centralize measurement by aligning with a GA4 source of truth model, ensuring consistency and accuracy across your analytics.\n\nWhat to do once the data is in your platforms\n\nWhen your data is in your platforms and ready to leverage, experiment with these tactics:\n\nSearch Bidding: Value-Based Bidding: Import your GA4, Adobe Analytics or advanced BigQuery (BQ) data into Google Ads or SA360 to leverage a value-based bidding strategy.\n\nProgrammatic Bidding - Custom Bidding or Automated Bidding: Write a custom script, or use in-line settings with your GA4, CM360 or BQ data to bid toward your 1P data signals.\n\nAudience Capabilities - Targeting, Suppression and Expansion: Upload and share your Customer Match, LiveRamp, GA4, CM360 or BQ audience sets with DV360 to target new, suppress existing or expand current 1P data audiences to achieve your KPIs.\n\nBut….what about PAIR?\n\nPublisher Advertiser Identity Resolution (PAIR) “gives publishers and advertisers the option to securely and privately reconcile their first-party data for audiences who have visited both an advertiser’s and a publisher’s site.” Essentially, it allows brands to match their 1P data with publishers to buy more aligned and effective media. LiveRamp, NBCU and Disney’s DRAX are some of the industry players with offerings compatible with PAIR. And DV360 is an activation hub for these integrations and connected audiences.\n\nPAIR allows brands and publishers to match data like never before, making your programmatic media targeting stronger than through 3P cookies. Even though 3P cookies are staying, it doesn’t mean they are the best opportunity for brands to leverage. We’ve already seen buyers begin to implement these new, cookieless strategies and expect more to follow.",
      "# [Results | Six Flags | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/six-flags)\nEntertainment giant Six Flags operates theme parks and attractions throughout North America. Their marketing team relies heavily on data from its web, app and sales platforms to monitor sales and marketing metrics and make informed decisions about park operations and guest experiences.\n\nSix Flags partnered with Google Cloud and Adswerve for a marketing analytics workshop to help identify untapped opportunities in their data. Through that process, the teams pinpointed an initiative to explore expanding Six Flags’ existing social sentiment initiative.\n\nTheir legacy sentiment tool was limited to providing a high-level brand score and couldn’t connect to Reddit, which was a big ask from senior leadership. Both the marketing team and the C-suite wanted the ability to go deeper to create and monitor scores by park location and key categories so they could better understand what products and experiences visitors enjoy — and uncover friction points they need to act on.\n\nUltimately, the Six Flags marketing team wanted to understand their guests’ perceptions of the brand, parks and customer experience to see what works and what doesn’t — and easily share the findings with the C-suite for visibility, investigation and quick action.\n\nAdswerve got to work, diving into Six Flags' robust social sentiment solution needs. The team uncovered that Six Flags wanted to monitor sentiment in five core categories: entertainment, food & beverage, price, cleanliness, wait times and customer experience for each of its 27 parks across five social platforms: Google Reviews, Trip Advisor, Instagram, Facebook and Reddit. Because Six Flags operates parks in Canada and Mexico, they also needed the ability to translate French and Spanish social posts into English.\n\nAfter thoroughly investigating Six Flags' solution requirements, we began building a new, more robust social sentiment tool. We used Apify to connect the five social sources in Google Cloud Platform’s data warehouse, BigQuery, reducing the need for custom API development and shortening implementation time.\n\nOnce we connected the data, our data engineers leveraged the full power of Google Cloud to automate data pulls, transform data (including translating other languages into English), assign sentiment scores and categories, create trend summaries using generative AI and push the synthesized information to Looker in real time. It all happens from one platform with one SQL query.\n\nSix Flags can now view and share a Looker dashboard that includes overall and park-specific sentiment scores and uses generative AI to surface the top five positive and negative trends in a \"week in review\" summary. They can easily see performance and insights — and the social comments driving them — and monitor them over time.\n\nThe power of this data was realized shortly into the project while the dashboard was still in development. A park approached marketing to update its highly trafficked park homepage, theorizing visitors were unhappy with recent maintenance impacting ride availability. Six Flags marketing was able to quickly validate the topic was trending for the park in the initial data sets and move forward confidently with the site update to better set expectations for visitors. And while seasonality and completed maintenance both play a part, the park has seen fewer negative posts and its customer experience sentiment score climb month-over-month since implementing the change.\n\nToday, Six Flags can easily view and understand overall customer sentiment and drill in by park across the five main performance categories in their Looker dashboard to uncover additional opportunities to improve the customer experience. If sentiment drops in a particular park in a specific category over time, they can explore the reasons and quickly remedy them. Similarly, they can identify why sudden dips or spikes are happening and quantify how critical an issue is by how many people are discussing it. The Six Flags marketing team can also see the immediate impact price changes, new or updated rides, events, seasonality and more have on sentiment in the short and long term, and make appropriate changes to their digital marketing programs, park operations and more.\n\nBeyond providing powerful insights, the new solution saves Six Flags time. What used to be a manual process, taking 15 people two to three hours per week each, is now fully automated, incorporates the latest AI technology and is easily shareable with organization stakeholders.\n\nUp next? Six Flags is entering their busy events season and plans to use the new social sentiment tool to see how national events stack up against park-specific ones. They’ll incorporate their learning into their future events strategy. The team also plans to add X (formerly Twitter) to their selected social platform sources.",

      "# [8 Ways to Maximize Your DV360 CTV Strategy: From Inventory Packages to Netflix Deals and Beyond by Brittany Medina on 2024-09-13](https://adswerve.com/blog/8-ways-to-maximize-your-dv360-ctv-strategy)\nConnected TV (CTV) has been transforming the advertising landscape for years, but as we venture deeper in the second half of 2024, it brings new opportunities that advertisers can’t afford to miss. With more viewers shifting from traditional cable to streaming services, platforms like Display & Video 360 (DV360) offer a unique and dynamic way to engage your target audience on a larger scale. The recent addition of Netflix as premium inventory within DV360 is one of the more recent standout developments, providing a powerful tool to reach consumers in a highly interactive environment.\n\nAs CTV continues to evolve, it’s crucial to develop a comprehensive strategy that includes clear objectives, a well-defined budget and a deep understanding of the available tools and inventory packages. This post is designed to help you navigate the complexities of CTV advertising, from setting strategic goals and budgeting effectively to leveraging advanced targeting options and maximizing cross-device measurement.\n\n1. Set Clear Goals, Budget and Implement High-Funnel Strategies\n\nBefore diving into your CTV campaign, ensure you have clear goals and an appropriate budget. Define what success looks like for your campaign. Are you aiming for brand awareness, user engagement or direct conversions? Once you have your goals set, allocate a budget that aligns with these objectives.\n\nCTV is particularly effective for high-funnel strategies, which focus on increasing awareness and interest. Consider the following metrics for your CTV campaigns:\n\nCompleted View Rate (CVR)\n\nAudible and Visible on Complete (AVOC)\n\nTarget CPM (Cost per Thousand Impressions)\n\nCPV (Cost per View)\n\nReach and Frequency\n\nThese metrics help ensure your ads are seen and heard, maximizing the impact of your brand message.\n\n2. Use High-Level Floodlight Tags for Awareness and Cross-Device Measurement\n\nLeverage high-level floodlight tags, such as those on your home page or product description pages, to track users across devices. This allows you to measure the effectiveness of your CTV ads when users convert on other devices, such as their phones. With cross-device measurement now available in Campaign Manager 360 (CM360) and DV360, you can now capture users who saw your CTV ad and converted or went to your site on any device. Then, if you want to expand beyond awareness and into performance, build a new insertion order that remarkets to users with fresh CTV ads that measure purchases/lower funnel floodlights. Or you can even serve display ads targeting the same home page/description page audience and measuring sales, guiding users further down the funnel.\n\nThis strategy enables the platform to have individual goals by focusing one CTV tactic on awareness while a second CTV (or display tactic) focuses on driving performance, contributing to the campaign's overall efficacy. Think of it similarly to display goals and strategies for prospecting and retargeting, but apply it to CTV.\n\n3. Target Remarketing Ads Effectively\n\nWhen remarketing to an audience, use a high-volume list of users and target the open exchange or private marketplaces (PMPs) rather than individual publishers for broader reach across CTV screens. This approach ensures you reach a larger audience, enhancing the effectiveness of your remarketing efforts.\n\nIf you’re only targeting one publisher, either with a direct Preferred deal or a Programmatic Guaranteed deal, layer your audience on the supply side (if possible). Note: This may incur additional costs, so be sure to ask.\n\n4. Leverage Existing Inventory Packages\n\nInventory packages can simplify the process of buying CTV ads. Here are some recommendations when shopping for inventory:\n\nAlways-0n Run of Network (RON) CTV packages by exchange: These packages provide a wide array of publishers and scalability. They’re ideal for layering audiences from the DSP side.\n\nContextual CTV packages: Tailor your campaigns to specific contexts such as Home & Garden, Travel, or News. This is particularly useful during the political season for election-related ads.\n\nConsider packages from leading providers like Google Ad Manager, FreeWheel, Magnite and Xandr. These providers offer extensive catalogs of packages, including RON deals that encompass numerous publishers, providing broad reach and scale.\n\nWhy would you package all your inventory this way? In summary, leveraging economies of scale in programmatic media and ensuring a large inventory supply are critical for achieving cost efficiency, broader reach, precise targeting and overall better performance in advertising campaigns. By understanding and applying these principles, advertisers can maximize their return on investment, drive substantial growth in their CTV strategies and drive users down the funnel.\n\n5. Create Your Own PMPs or Programmatic Guaranteed Deal\n\nFor more control, create your own Programmatic Guaranteed deal, Preferred deal, or Private Marketplace (PMP) deals. Curate your inventory by:\n\nPublisher/Media Owner: Access to premium content providers like Netflix (see below), Hulu, Disney properties, Warner Brothers media (CNN, Discovery) and HBO (MAX).\n\nCurate custom 1:1 deals with select publishers or networks to reach a specific audience or type of content.\n\nDevice: Target ads on Roku, Samsung TVs and VIZIO TVs.\n\nSee if these providers have any second-party data you can leverage off-the-shelf for more precise audience targeting.\n\nVirtual Multi-Video Programming Distributor: Utilize platforms like Sling TV, YouTube TV and Hulu Live to target cord-cutters who get cable-like content via streaming.\n\nGet more effective reach with multi-channel distributors.\n\nBuyers should break these deals out into their own Line Items or Insertion Orders to keep bidding and reporting clean.\n\nIf you're planning to run a Programmatic Guaranteed deal, be aware of the publisher’s minimum spend requirement. Make sure you account only for pure media spend dollars and not the gross budget to avoid discrepancies. Knowing these details upfront will help you meet the necessary thresholds without any surprises.\n\n6. Tap into Netflix’s Premium Inventory for Maximum Impact\n\nStarting August 1, 2024, DV360 buyers can access Netflix’s direct deal inventory. As a leading streaming platform with a massive, dedicated audience, Netflix offers an unparalleled opportunity to place your brand in front of viewers who are fully engaged in their favorite shows and movies. This addition makes DV360 an even more powerful tool for CTV media buying, providing access to top-tier content that resonates with viewers. Whether your focus is on building brand awareness or driving conversions, integrating Netflix’s inventory into your strategy ensures your ads are seen by a wide and attentive audience.\n\n7. Utilize YouTube TV and YouTube CTV Inventory\n\nYouTube TV offers exclusive access to a wide range of television networks with ad-supported subscription options. DV360 is the only DSP with access to this inventory, providing personalized ads on live TV, on-demand videos and cloud-based DVRs.\n\nFootball season is just around the corner, and only YouTube TV offers NFL’s Sunday Ticket. Take advantage of this by targeting YouTube TV Sports content only. Magnite also now offers Programmatic Guaranteed Live TV sports inventory! This allows buyers to maximize their reach.\n\nFor more affordable CTV ads, differentiate YouTube on CTV devices from YouTube TV. YouTube on CTV devices offers traditional YouTube app content at lower CPMs ($10-$15 range) compared to regular CTV prices ($25-$35 CPM range). This is a great way to dip your toes into CTV at a cost affordable price if you’re new to CTV or are working with a lower budget.\n\n8. Use GA4 Audiences and DV360’s Audience Tools\n\nFor advanced audience targeting, utilize GA4’s predictive and propensity audiences.\n\nPredictive audiences in GA4 use machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and predict future behavior. This allows advertisers to identify segments of users likely to take specific actions, such as making a purchase or returning to the site.\n\nPropensity modeling is a sophisticated analytical approach used to predict the likelihood that a user will take a specific action, such as making a purchase, subscribing to a service or engaging with content. By leveraging data science and machine learning, propensity models allow advertisers to target high-value users more effectively, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of their marketing campaigns.\n\nIf GA4 audiences aren’t available use floodlights or audiences created from floodlight tags for remarketing. Combine these with DV360’s audience expansion tool to increase scale and reach potential customers.\n\nBe sure to layer these audiences on the DSP side when implementing.\n\nWhat Next?\n\nBy adopting these eight strategies, media buyers can significantly enhance their CTV advertising, ensuring that they effectively reach their target audience and achieve campaign objectives. Staying informed about the latest tools, technologies and industry trends is crucial for continuously refining and optimizing your CTV strategy.\n\nStaying up to date on new developments allows buyers to leverage emerging opportunities, tackle challenges and maintain a competitive edge in the dynamic world of CTV advertising. This proactive approach will not only help meet immediate goals but also ensure long-term success and growth in your CTV campaigns.",
