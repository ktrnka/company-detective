      "# [Results | World Surf League | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/wsl)\nWorld Surf League (WSL) is a digital-first sports league by design because no one knows exactly when the wave conditions will be right. They plan events around a two-week time window at locations around the globe. When the surf is up, the competition begins. Being all-digital allows WSL to publish content fast and stream surfing events as they occur. Fans can use a mobile app to watch live broadcasts and keep up to date with their favorite WSL athletes anywhere, anytime.\n\nAfter consolidating several live events from major surfing brands onto its own video streaming platform, WSL needed better answers to questions about viewership. How many fans engage regularly? How many tune in to multiple events? Who are the superfans — the ones who drive the majority of consumption and engagement— and which new users are most likely to become superfans?\n\nTo better understand fan behavior, WSL began using Google Analytics 360 to gather data from a variety of customer touchpoints and worked with us to accelerate time to value and keep data quality high.\n\nWe combined and cleaned data from Analytics 360, Facebook and WSL’s internal system into a single data lake and modeled superfan attributes using machine learning algorithms. We then applied early engagement attributes of superfans so WSL could focus its marketing on new users.\n\nThe fan insights WSL gained using Google Analytics 360 with Google BigQuery allowed the organization to reduce cost per conversion by more than 50%, which more than doubled the efficiency of ad spend aimed at driving fan engagement and content viewership.\n\nBy focusing on higher ROI customers, WSL drives greater fan engagement with live events and digital content—without increasing its marketing budget. When weather conditions deliver the best waves and large numbers of fans are looking at content, WSL can easily scale its analytics on demand. And during the offseason, it can scale down, which has allowed it to reduce infrastructure costs by 70%.\n\nNow its team can ask more sophisticated questions of its data: How do wave conditions affect viewership? How do athletes’ scores correlate with other factors such as wave height, time of day, or level of competition? And what exactly is a superfan worth to the business?\n\nDownload the full case study.",

      "# [Gannet Case Study by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/gannett)\nGannett, one of the largest publishers of locally based print and digital media in the United States, partnered with Adswerve to better understand audience behavior and identify opportunities to drive memberships and decrease churn. Because membership numbers remain a critical revenue component for media companies, Gannett had three primary goals:\n\nIncrease digital memberships using propensity scoring\n\nIdentify users at risk of unsubscribing and target with interventions to retain them\n\nBuild a recommendation engine to determine the best content to drive action\n\nThe publisher wanted to employ BigQuery as their marketing data warehouse to power machine learning insights and interventions. They also needed to go beyond summary aggregates and use machine learning processing for more detailed analysis.\n\nGannett came to us with the idea of building scoring models to inform what they needed to meet their goals. Armed with this information, Gannett would be able to intercept users with relevant content or actions to increase memberships and retention.\n\nWe collaborated with the strategic development team, headed by VP of Digital Operations and Product Development Chris Biondi, to bring this project to fruition. The project team, led by Director of Corporate Consumer Data Strategy Rich Forsgren, relied on Adswerve team members to help shape and refine the strategy. We approached the initiative with five workstreams: Data Preparation and Exploratory Data Analysis, Propensity Modeling, Churn Modeling, Content Recommendations and Intervention Identification.\n\nNow that the modeling and workflows are set up, Gannett can:\n\nUse propensity scoring to increase digital subscriptions\n\nRetain users at risk of unsubscribing\n\nCreate compelling, targeted content that converts\n\nThe team has a solid foundation for other activities, too, including building and leveraging audiences across the Google Marketing Platform, surfacing new reporting dimensions, and building more real-time scoring to dynamically alter user experiences and develop new content personalization offerings\n\nThe project continues to evolve as the team reviews results.",
      "# [Results | FTD | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/ftd)\nLeading online floral retailer FTD has multiple customer touchpoints across radio, linear, connected TV (CTV), social, search engine marketing (SEM) and programmatic display channels. Ultimately, FTD wants to reach its target audiences and deepen relationships with them in their preferred channels in the most cost-effective and efficient way possible. To accomplish this, they need access to the insights through an intuitive, prescriptive interface.\n\nAs one of the most trusted online floral retailers in the world, FTD took an industry-leading approach to prepare for a cookieless future. The company used advanced data engineering techniques to consolidate their data into Google Cloud and BigQuery. From there, FTD prioritized building a new privacy-centric attribution model that could allow its marketing team to determine the most effective media mix. For this, they turned to Adswerve to help build a modeling solution that will meet today’s (and tomorrow’s) privacy standards, understand its customers' preferences, and see how to optimally allocate its marketing budget across its many online and offline touchpoints.\n\nUsing Google Cloud technology, Adswerve data scientists built a multifaceted, durable modeling solution to determine which media touchpoints will impact FTD’s revenue the most.\n\nThe FTD data estate is in an advanced state which made it easy for Adswerve to review and validate FTD's Google Analytics dataset and then create, train and optimize a model using Python to help FTD understand how its media spend affects sales and to learn more about its spend allocation across media.\n\nAdswerve’s data scientists also used machine learning (ML) to predict which channels will reach select audiences and allow the FTD team to target its messaging to the right customers at the right times without oversaturation.\n\nOnce the model was up and running, the Adswerve team developed channel attribution, adstock effects, and diminishing returns visualizations for the FTD team to see the insights the model gleaned from the data.\n\nFinally, Adswerve developed a proprietary budget tool that offers FTD weekly model-derived insights with recommended budget allocation. The easy-to-use app is available to FTD’s entire marketing organization and secured using Google Cloud.\n\nWith off-the-shelf MMM products, you can’t see how the models work or customize them, and they often take an enormous amount of time and effort to implement. But using Google Cloud gave Adswerve the power, speed and flexibility to tailor models to FTD’s needs seamlessly.\n\nAbout Mixed Media Models\n\nWith a mixed-media model, you can:\n\nSee how each media channel impacts your target KPIs\n\nUnderstand how media channels perform with a change in spend\n\nEstimate the optimal budget allocation across your media channels\n\nPlus, see how much additional spend will improve channel performance and how long-lasting the effects will be.\n\nAdswerve’s Google Cloud modeling solution delivered value right from the start. When it first tested the modeling solution, FTD determined its television campaign spend wasn’t optimal. Since then, the marketing team has reduced its TV campaign budget by 30% while still reaching the same audience. They were able to reallocate the savings into other channels that had more opportunity to grow.\n\nMoving forward, this new durable technology will drive FTD’s data-informed decisions about media purchasing. Every member of its marketing organization can easily access and seamlessly use Google Cloud’s machine learning models and insights using Adswerve’s app to make quick, revenue-boosting media decisions.",

Tasked with managing Crowd Cow’s paid search and shopping campaigns, Ovative needed to generate new customer orders with a CPA lower than their average.\n\nOvative knew email registrations were a valuable component of driving new customer acquisition and it wanted to try using new weighted formulas, taking into account email registrations, new customer orders and subscriptions to understand how the right combination could drive additional new customer volume at the same — or lower — CPA.\n\nOvative turned to us to help them dive into Google Search Ads 360 and develop unique column formulas by ad tactics and bid strategies based on campaign-driven values. Working closely, our teams set up and solved issues in order to ensure all the formulas were properly weighted and working seamlessly.\n\nIn the six weeks after implementing the formulas and new bid strategies, the teams generated a 108% increase in conversions in six weeks on an 86% increase in spend and lowered CPA by 9%.",

The company turned to us when it needed to bring it all together and securely house it in one location while streamlining processes.\n\nWe built a marketing data warehouse using BigQuery in Google Cloud, which tied Alaska’s first-party data together across CRM, media and site analytics. Next, we created predictive lifetime value (pLTV) models using Google Cloud AutoML. Then we fed the predictive scores into the Campaign Manager Conversions API. This connection enabled us to use that data in Search Ads 360 and set up an Auction Time Bid Strategy to quickly, predictively and programmatically bid to pLTV.\n\nAlong the way, we uncovered some interesting insights about the values tied to customers’ origin and destination (O&D) airports, travel days, ages, loyalty program membership and more.\n\nUsing the advanced infrastructure and modeling has helped Alaska achieve a higher ROAS. In fact, activating the information across its Google platforms led to a 30% increase in ROAS for O&D campaigns and helped the company earn $1 more per paid search click.",

      "# [Campaign Trafficking Guide on 2018-08-17](https://staging.adswerve.com/trafficking-guide/)\nCampaign Hierarchy Explained\n\nThe Campaign Manager 360 platform consists of a stack of hierarchical levels with the Advertiser sitting on top. An Advertiser can have many Campaigns to represent different strategies. At the Campaign level, your goal is to traffick your media plan to generate Placement Tags to provide to your Publishers who will deliver your ad inventory. The objects included within a Campaign are defined below and are listed in the order that they appear in the Campaign hierarchy.\n\nSites are the websites, networks or mobile apps where ad inventory has been purchased from and can have many Placements assigned to it.\n\nPlacements represent the ad slots that have been purchased with a media buy and can have many Ads assigned to it.\n\nCreatives are the art or creative assets that will be shown to users when an Ad is served. Creative can be shared across Campaigns and assigned to many Ads.\n\nAds serve as a bridge between Placements and Creative and control how or when Creative is served. Ads can have multiple creative versions assigned to it and can be assigned to multiple Placements across different Sites.\n\nTrafficking Workflow\n\nWe recommend to traffick your Campaign following the described workflow to help you stay organized. However, once the process and hierarchy become more familiar, the workflow may be modified to fit the best process for your team.\n\nStep 1: Create a Campaign\n\nCreate the shell of your Campaign that you would like to create under your Advertiser. Each Campaign can have different Placements and Ads for your marketing strategy. The properties define your run dates and can control other default settings to apply to your Campaign.\n\nSelect Campaigns from the navigation bar at the top of CM360.\n\nClick on the New button.\n\nEnter the name for the Campaign.\n\nAssign the Campaign to an Advertiser.\n\nEnter the Campaign Start and End Dates.\n\nCreate a Default Landing Page URL.\n\nClick Save.\n\nStep 2: Create Placements\n\nThe purpose of creating Placements is to represent what was purchased within your media buy. For each Placement that is created, CM360 will generate a code snippet or Placement tag to provide to your Publishers for implementation.\n\nClick on the New button and select Placement.\n\nSelect Current account or Site Directory to access the list of Sites.\n\nSearch and select the Publisher Site from step 2.\n\nEnter a name for the Placement. The name should represent what was purchased within your media buy.\n\nSet all required Placement property settings.\n\nClick Save.\n\nStep 3: Upload Creative\n\nWhen you upload Creative at the Campaign level, it will automatically be added to the Creatives tab at the Advertiser level which allows it to be shared across other Campaigns. We recommend uploading Creatives at the Campaign level using the Batch upload option described below. However, if you need to add existing Creative from your Advertiser to your Campaign, you may use the Add from Advertiser option instead. Learn more about options to upload Creative.\n\nClick on the New button and select Batch upload.\n\nSelect Creative Assets if you have creative files to upload into CM360. You can also choose to batch upload third-party asset URLs.\n\nSelect files to upload.\n\nYou can select multiple files or a .zip file of all your assets. When uploading HTML5 creative, you will be required to upload a .zip file and a backup static image to associate with it.\n\nClick Next.\n\nIf you are uploading a static image of a particular size for the first time, CM360 will prompt you to select Default creative to generate Default Ads. Default Ads are system Ads that can serve if there are no other eligible Ads available. It is recommended to use brand-neutral creative for your Default Creative.\n\nClick Next and Save.\n\nStep 4: Create Ads\n\nAds function as the bridge between your Placements and Creative and control when your creative is served. Create at least 1 Standard Ad for each Placement for CM360 to serve. Learn more about all available Ad types.\n\nClick New and Standard.\n\nEnter a name for the Ad. The naming convention should help you identify the Ad in reporting.\n\nSet the Ad Status to Active.\n\nEnter the Ad Start and End Dates to indicate when the Ad is eligible to serve. It is recommended to set the Ad Start date to the current date to allow for testing.\n\nSet any other desired Ad Delivery properties (optional).\n\nExpand the Creative assignments section and click Edit creative assignments.\n\nSelect the Creative(s) you would like to serve/rotate.\n\nScroll to the right of the Creative name to select or set landing page.\n\nExpand the Placement assignments section and click Edit placement assignments.\n\nSelect the Placement(s) you would like the Ad to serve to.\n\nClick Save.\n\nStep 5: Download tags\n\nExport the relevant Placement Tags to provide to your Publishers for implementation. Export all available tag types to allow your Publishers to select an acceptable tag type.\n\nClick Tags and select Download tags.\n\nSelect Excel as the Format (recommended).\n\nClick Download.\n\nStep 6: Verify Impressions (recommended)\n\nAfter Placement tags have been implemented or tested, we strongly recommend monitoring performance data 24 hours after a Campaign has gone live by viewing reports from Reporting.\n\nHelpful Resources\n\nTo access the Campaign Manager 360 Help Center, please click here.\n\nFor additional training on Campaign Manager 360, please access self-paced modules and certification via the Skillshop.\n\nStay on top of the latest updates by subscribing to the Google Marketing Platform Blog.",

      "# [Results | Six Flags | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/six-flags)\nEntertainment giant Six Flags operates theme parks and attractions throughout North America. Their marketing team relies heavily on data from its web, app and sales platforms to monitor sales and marketing metrics and make informed decisions about park operations and guest experiences.\n\nSix Flags partnered with Google Cloud and Adswerve for a marketing analytics workshop to help identify untapped opportunities in their data. Through that process, the teams pinpointed an initiative to explore expanding Six Flags’ existing social sentiment initiative.\n\nTheir legacy sentiment tool was limited to providing a high-level brand score and couldn’t connect to Reddit, which was a big ask from senior leadership. Both the marketing team and the C-suite wanted the ability to go deeper to create and monitor scores by park location and key categories so they could better understand what products and experiences visitors enjoy — and uncover friction points they need to act on.\n\nUltimately, the Six Flags marketing team wanted to understand their guests’ perceptions of the brand, parks and customer experience to see what works and what doesn’t — and easily share the findings with the C-suite for visibility, investigation and quick action.\n\nAdswerve got to work, diving into Six Flags' robust social sentiment solution needs. The team uncovered that Six Flags wanted to monitor sentiment in five core categories: entertainment, food & beverage, price, cleanliness, wait times and customer experience for each of its 27 parks across five social platforms: Google Reviews, Trip Advisor, Instagram, Facebook and Reddit. Because Six Flags operates parks in Canada and Mexico, they also needed the ability to translate French and Spanish social posts into English.\n\nAfter thoroughly investigating Six Flags' solution requirements, we began building a new, more robust social sentiment tool. We used Amplify to connect the five social sources in Google Cloud Platform’s data warehouse, BigQuery, reducing the need for custom API development and shortening implementation time.\n\nOnce we connected the data, our data engineers leveraged the full power of Google Cloud to automate data pulls, transform data (including translating other languages into English), assign sentiment scores and categories, create trend summaries using generative AI and push the synthesized information to Looker in real time. It all happens from one platform with one SQL query.\n\nSix Flags can now view and share a Looker dashboard that includes overall and park-specific sentiment scores and uses generative AI to surface the top five positive and negative trends in a \"week in review\" summary. They can easily see performance and insights — and the social comments driving them — and monitor them over time.\n\nThe power of this data was realized shortly into the project while the dashboard was still in development. A park approached marketing to update its highly trafficked park homepage, theorizing visitors were unhappy with recent maintenance impacting ride availability. Six Flags marketing was able to quickly validate the topic was trending for the park in the initial data sets and move forward confidently with the site update to better set expectations for visitors. And while seasonality and completed maintenance both play a part, the park has seen fewer negative posts and its customer experience sentiment score climb month-over-month since implementing the change.\n\nToday, Six Flags can easily view and understand overall customer sentiment and drill in by park across the five main performance categories in their Looker dashboard to uncover additional opportunities to improve the customer experience. If sentiment drops in a particular park in a specific category over time, they can explore the reasons and quickly remedy them. Similarly, they can identify why sudden dips or spikes are happening and quantify how critical an issue is by how many people are discussing it. The Six Flags marketing team can also see the immediate impact price changes, new or updated rides, events, seasonality and more have on sentiment in the short and long term, and make appropriate changes to their digital marketing programs, park operations and more.\n\nBeyond providing powerful insights, the new solution saves Six Flags time. What used to be a manual process, taking 15 people two to three hours per week each, is now fully automated, incorporates the latest AI technology and is easily shareable with organization stakeholders.\n\nUp next? Six Flags is entering their busy events season and plans to use the new social sentiment tool to see how national events stack up against park-specific ones. They’ll incorporate their learning into their future events strategy. The team also plans to add X (formerly Twitter) to their selected social platform sources.",
      "# [Case Study - Cedars Sinai by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/cedars-sinai)\nLeveraging Adobe Customer Journey Analytics to Create a Long-Term, Privacy-Safe, Foundation for Omnichannel Analytics and Personalization for Cedars-Sinai\n\nProblem\n\nLeading healthcare organization Cedars-Sinai strives to be at the forefront of care and deliver an exceptional patient experience. This extends to its digital experience and the Cedar’s Consumer Digital Innovation (CDI) team's efforts to advance and innovate its analytics and personalization strategy — a daunting challenge in healthcare due to complex patient privacy requirements.\n\nTo gain deeper insights into patient interactions across various channels, Cedars-Sinai's CDI team sought a modern analytics platform that extends beyond basic product and funnel analytics. They needed a solution that could map consumer and patient journeys across channels and identify specific user segments requiring actionable engagement. Viewing this as a strategic opportunity, the CDI team aimed to find a long-term solution that not only adheres to Cedars-Sinai’s stringent patient privacy requirements but also advances the organization's goal of delivering large-scale, compliant, omnichannel personalization for patients and users.\n\nTo develop this modern analytics infrastructure based on consistent tracking and accurate, HIPAA-compliant data collection across the patient journey, the CDI team selected Adobe’s Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) to replace Adobe Analytics.\n\nWith the platform selected, Cedars-Sinai needed a partner to help implement CJA properly and create consistency across several disparate web properties and mobile applications (website domains, email, MyChart and virtual care, and offline touchpoints, like call centers) and lay the foundation for its long-term omnichannel personalization strategy.\n\n\"We always aimed to transition to a more advanced analytics platform like CJA to bridge the gap between channels, gain better consumer insights, and deliver a more personalized experience while ensuring HIPAA compliance. With Adswerve’s deep expertise in analytics and technology, we’ve had a partner solely focused on delivering that value and helping us keep moving forward.\"\n\nTara Konar\n\nDirector, Technology Development\n\nCedars-Sinai\n\n\"I wanted to leverage the CJA project to develop an analytics strategy that we can really hone in on moving forward. Previously, our attribution strategy was often tied to a project's immediate needs, causing fragmented results in our tracking. Our conversations with Adswerve helped us validate our realizations, gain external feedback and insights to develop and evolve a new tracking strategy and architecture for the future.\"\n\nRyan Achzet\n\nManager, Technology Development\n\nCedars-Sinai\n\nSolution\n\nConsulting with Adobe led the CDI team to connect with potential implementation partners. The team ultimately selected Adswerve to advise on and implement CJA because of the consultancy’s expertise and experience. From the initial conversation to the seamless discovery and scoping process, it was clear that Adswerve could help the CDI team not only implement CJA but also collaborate on the strategic foundation it needed for its long-term plans. Once Adswerve was on board, the teams collaborated to develop and execute a multi-phase implementation plan.\n\nIn phase one, Adswerve served as both a technical and strategic partner to the CDI team. Adswerve completed the initial CJA implementation to connect Cedars-Sinai’s primary domain, five sub-domains and iOS and Android apps, and deliver new insights into the patient journey across their web and app assets.\n\nAdswerve also collaborated to set the foundations for a new data governance strategy at Cedars-Sinai, helping them evolve from disparate systems and tracking approaches to a more holistic strategy. The strategic framework and new tracking documentation were key to implementing CJA to be scalable, consistent and HIPAA-compliant across the organization's tools and teams for years to come. The Adswerve team also helped align workstreams as the CDI team worked in tandem to implement the Adobe Client Data Layer internally.\n\nWith CJA implemented and currently in beta, the CDI team plans to make it the organization’s analytics platform of record in mid-2024. Adswerve will continue partnering with the CDI team to ensure Cedars-Sinai can fully leverage the new tools and insights from phase one as it expands CJA to connect additional domains, the MyChart patient portal and offline sources.\n\n\"We approached the project as a technical team, thinking of it as an implementation engagement, not a strategy-level engagement. But then we saw that the Adswerve team was on it, talking about every specific point and guiding us to discover new things that we hadn't even thought about. That was big for us.\"\n\nTara Konar\n\nDirector, Technology Development\n\nCedars-Sinai\n\n\"I’ve had a really good experience with Adswerve. There is a level of collaboration that does not exist elsewhere that I've really enjoyed. Their dialogue helps us guide our team to arrive at the best solution for Cedars.\"\n\nRyan Achzet\n\nManager, Technology Development\n\nCedars-Sinai\n\n2\n\nWork Streams\n\nMoving in Tandem\n\n1\n\nImplementation\n\nPhase Completed\n\n8\n\nDomains & Apps Integrated\n\n100%\n\nconfidence in\n\nHIPaA COMPLIANce\n\nResults\n\nHaving CJA properly implemented and updated data governance underway allows Cedars-Sinai to collect accurate data across its many web and mobile assets on its journey to full omnichannel analytics and personalization. Cedars can now leverage its data to glean new insights about the user journey — especially between mobile and web — to help it better segment audiences, create more personalized marketing campaigns for patients and guests, and have clearer visibility into performance. And the organization can evolve and mature its tech stack by layering additional tools and technologies on top of CJA, like Adobe Journey Optimizer, which will further its goal to be a leader in delivering scalable, omnichannel, personalized customer experiences.\n\n\"With the strategy and underlying work in place in partnership with Adswerve, we’re in a position to improve reporting and push towards personalization. It sets us up for the next three to five years to easily bring on new tools and leverage CJA capabilities vs. starting from ground zero with each new integration.\"\n\nRyan Achzet\n\nManager, Technology Development\n\nCedars-Sinai\n\n\"I’m excited to leverage CJA to provide deeper insights into the overall patient journey to the organization, which is a very new concept at Cedars, and move forward on our journey of personalization while balancing our requirements around compliance. The deep analytics and technology expertise brought by Adswerve have helped get us to this point, and now we’re in a position to continue innovating and improving.\"\n\nTara Konar\n\nDirector, Technology Development\n\nCedars-Sinai\n\nAll case studies\n\nHave a similar project you'd\n\nlike to talk about?",

      "# [YOUR GUIDE TO TRAFFICKING IN CAMPAIGN MANAGER 360 by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/cm-trafficking-guide)\nBefore beginning to traffick your Campaign, it is important to understand the Campaign hierarchy to help you traffick efficiently to stay organized and save you time!\n\nCAMPAIGN HIERARCHY EXPLAINED\n\nThe Campaign Manager 360 platform consists of a stack of hierarchical levels with the Advertiser sitting on top. An Advertiser can have many Campaigns to represent different strategies. At the Campaign level, your goal is to traffick your media plan to generate Placement Tags to provide to your Publishers who will deliver your ad inventory. The objects included within a Campaign are defined below and are listed in the order that they appear in the Campaign hierarchy.\n\nSites are the websites, networks or mobile apps where ad inventory has been purchased from and can have many Placements assigned to it.\n\nPlacements represent the ad slots that have been purchased with a media buy and can have many Ads assigned to it.\n\nCreatives are the art or creative assets that will be shown to users when an Ad is served. Creative can be shared across Campaigns and assigned to many Ads.\n\nAds serve as a bridge between Placements and Creative and control how or when Creative is served. Ads can have multiple creative versions assigned to it and can be assigned to multiple Placements across different Sites.\n\nTRAFFICKING WORKFLOW\n\nWe recommend to traffick your Campaign following the described workflow to help you stay organized. However, once the process and hierarchy become more familiar, the workflow may be modified to fit the best process for your team.\n\nSTEP 1: CREATE A CAMPAIGN\n\nCreate the shell of your Campaign that you would like to create under your Advertiser. Each Campaign can have different Placements and Ads for your marketing strategy. The properties define your run dates and can control other default settings to apply to your Campaign.\n\nSelect Campaigns from the navigation bar at the top of CM360.\n\nClick on the New button.\n\nEnter the name for the Campaign.\n\nAssign the Campaign to an Advertiser.\n\nEnter the Campaign Start and End Dates.\n\nCreate a Default Landing Page URL.\n\nClick Save.\n\nSTEP 2: CREATE PLACEMENTS\n\nThe purpose of creating Placements is to represent what was purchased within your media buy. For each Placement that is created, CM360 will generate a code snippet or Placement tag to provide to your Publishers for implementation.\n\nClick on the New button and select Placement.\n\nSelect Current account or Site Directory to access the list of Sites.\n\nSearch and select the Publisher Site from step 2.\n\nEnter a name for the Placement. The name should represent what was purchased within your media buy.\n\nSet all required Placement property settings.\n\nClick Save.\n\nSTEP 3: UPLOAD CREATIVE\n\nWhen you upload Creative at the Campaign level, it will automatically be added to the Creatives tab at the Advertiser level which allows it to be shared across other Campaigns. We recommend uploading Creatives at the Campaign level using the Batch upload option described below. However, if you need to add existing Creative from your Advertiser to your Campaign, you may use the Add from Advertiser option instead. Learn more about options to upload Creative.\n\nClick on the New button and select Batch upload.\n\nSelect Creative Assets if you have creative files to upload into CM360. You can also choose to batch upload third-party asset URLs.\n\nSelect files to upload.\n\nYou can select multiple files or a .zip file of all your assets. When uploading HTML5 creative, you will be required to upload a .zip file and a backup static image to associate with it.\n\nClick Next.\n\nIf you are uploading a static image of a particular size for the first time, CM360 will prompt you to select Default creative to generate Default Ads. Default Ads are system Ads that can serve if there are no other eligible Ads available. It is recommended to use brand-neutral creative for your Default Creative.\n\nClick Next and Save.\n\nSTEP 4: CREATE ADS\n\nAds function as the bridge between your Placements and Creative and control when your creative is served. Create at least 1 Standard Ad for each Placement for CM360 to serve. Learn more about all available Ad types.\n\nClick New and Standard.\n\nEnter a name for the Ad. The naming convention should help you identify the Ad in reporting.\n\nSet the Ad Status to Active.\n\nEnter the Ad Start and End Dates to indicate when the Ad is eligible to serve. It is recommended to set the Ad Start date to the current date to allow for testing.\n\nSet any other desired Ad Delivery properties (optional).\n\nExpand the Creative assignments section and click Edit creative assignments.\n\nSelect the Creative(s) you would like to serve/rotate.\n\nScroll to the right of the Creative name to select or set landing page.\n\nExpand the Placement assignments section and click Edit placement assignments.\n\nSelect the Placement(s) you would like the Ad to serve to.\n\nClick Save.\n\nSTEP 5: DOWNLOAD TAGS\n\nExport the relevant Placement Tags to provide to your Publishers for implementation. Export all available tag types to allow your Publishers to select an acceptable tag type.\n\nClick Tags and select Download tags.\n\nSelect Excel as the Format (recommended).\n\nClick Download.\n\nSTEP 6: VERIFY IMPRESSIONS (RECOMMENDED)\n\nAfter Placement tags have been implemented or tested, we strongly recommend monitoring performance data 24 hours after a Campaign has gone live by viewing reports from Reporting.\n\nHELPFUL RESOURCES\n\nTo access the Campaign Manager 360 Help Center, please click here.\n\nFor additional training on Campaign Manager 360, please access self-paced modules and certification via the Skillshop.\n\nStay on top of the latest updates by subscribing to the Google Marketing Platform Blog.\n\nFor additional questions, please contact us via support@adswerve.com.",
      "# [Urchin Retirement Party by Caleb Whitmore on 2012-01-22](https://adswerve.com/blog/urchin-retirement)\nOn January 20th Google announced it will be ceasing any new development for the Urchin Software product line and ending new purchases or upgrades after March 28th, 2012. So, what better thing to do than throw a retirement party for Urchin! It seemed fitting to us. In this post I've reviewed our take on what this means and what you should (or shouldn't) do about it. Enjoy, and don't forget to have a slice of cake before leaving.\n\nWhat Does the Retirement of Urchin Really Mean?\n\nThe team here at Analytics Pros was surprised by this announcement like you may be. But let's face it, Urchin has been around a long time, been a pioneer in the web analytics industry, and it's offspring has become arguably the most used web analytics platform on the planet. Not a bad record, eh? That said, the Google notice and the FAQ on the Urchin website leave a bit to be explained. While I can't speak for Google, I will try to clarify our understanding of Google's decision and its impact on you. First, I see three primary user groups this announcement impacts:\n\nCurrent Urchin 7.x license owners. Read more here.\n\nOwners of licenses to previous Urchin versions (5.x, 6.x). Read more here.\n\nProspective buyers of Urchin. Read more here.\n\nThe announcement of Urchin's end-of-life by Google is sure to impact each of these groups differently. As resellers, it impacts us too as we use the software ourselves and support hundreds who use it worldwide. Second, I'm thankful to hear a certain plan for Urchin's future, although dismayed it is one leading to discontinuation. Since Google acquired Urchin Software back in 2005 there has been much speculation about the future of Urchin Software products. Speculation was abruptly stopped when version 6 of Urchin was released in 2008. With version 7 coming out in 2010 it looked like Urchin Software was on a slow but forward-moving path. Google's announcement clarifies that path is ending with no new updates and no new sales after March 28th of 2012. Third, I know you'll have questions, want answers, and need to make a plan to deal with this news. We're here to help. We may not have answers for every question, but we're happy to hear your questions and concerns and respond as best we can. If you're our customer having purchased Urchin from us, we are continuing to support the product as long as we have customers running it and will continue to provide training for those wishing to receive it. Additionally, we're beginning work on ways to better support continuation or Urchin operations using our Urchin Hosting service as well as development of a means for supporting automated data extraction and permanent archival using Urchin 7's fantastic data export API.\n\nSo, What are Your Options with Urchin?\n\nDepending on which of the three groups above that you fall into, here are my thoughts and recommendations on your options from here forward.\n\nCurrent 7.x Owners\n\nIf are owner of a 7.x version of Urchin Software, here's what I think about how Google's announcement might impact you and what you should do about it.\n\nGood news with bad - version 7 just got an upgrade to 7.2 with many bug fixes! The bad news is that this is the last update the software will receive.\n\nWhile Google is \"discontinuing\" the Urchin product line, that doesn't mean Urchin dead. Urchin Software is lightweight and doesn't require much to keep running smoothly, so you're not going to just lose your software investment or data overnight. We have some customers still running Urchin versions 5 and 6, and have even seen an ancient version 3 or 4 installation from time to time. Keep your installation server well-maintained, move to a stable platform before the March 28th sales-cutoff, or migrate to our cloud-based solution, and your Urchin server can continue to run happily for years to come.\n\nThe biggest threat to running Urchin forever is the pace of OS change and a changing security landscape. For organizations that run Urchin entirely within their networks (no outside access), keeping an older OS around for years to come is viable (albeit perhaps annoying). If you must expose Urchin to the web, separating it from your network provides some insulation from security threats that might arise. Urchin 5 (circa 2004) still runs in many places (many large web hosts included), so the planning horizon for retiring Urchin probably doesn't need to be critical.\n\nThat said, as your planning and budgeting cycles allow, begin working on a migration plan for your web analytics needs. Google Analytics (standard or premium) may be good option. I've seen many of our customers already using GA while still running Urchin. Talk to your stakeholders and data users to explore whether or not this is a viable route. If not, or if you want/need to continue to analyze server logfiles, then you'll need to evaluate other software options. Our team has begun a search for comparable solutions in the software-based analytics space, so stay tuned to our blog and Twitter feed for updates on this.\n\nFor organizations with significant investments in customization and integration of Urchin we understand the news of Urchin's retirement may be harder to take in. I encourage you not to give up - as noted above, Urchin is resilient and will continue to run happily just as it does now for years to come. It's still the same software you purchased and use and will continue to operate in its current state so long as you choose to maintain its environment.\n\nIf you have any questions about Urchin's discontinuation and how it might impact you, planning for migration, support needs, or interest in our services for cloud archival of your Urchin server and data, simply contact us.\n\nOlder Version Owners\n\nFor owners of older Urchin license versions, here are my thoughts on Google's Urchin discontinuation announcement.\n\nIf you want to upgrade, now is the time. You will be forever unable to upgrade after the March 28th 2012 sales cut-off date. Urchin version 7 has many benefits over older versions, like faster processing, a data export API, an update user interface, and advanced segments to name a few. Plus, Urchin 7.2 (the latest and final release) will ensure you are set with what's most current before the upgrade window closes. Upgrading now to Urchin 7 will extend the life of your Urchin operation longer than remaining on an older version will allow.\n\nThat said, if you are happy with Urchin as-is, you don't need to do anything. So long as you can continue to maintain the Urchin operating environment, Urchin will continue to run. You're already running badly outdated software if you're using 6.x or older, and if that works for you, then there's no need to worry.\n\nPerhaps the main reason to upgrade to 7.2 before the sales cut-off date is the Data Export API in Urchin 7. The API is quite powerful and presents the most comprehensive option for exporting your data held within Urchin into another, more usable, format that will live beyond the limits of Urchin's reporting interface.\n\nIf you have any questions about Urchin's discontinuation, upgrading before license sales are ended, planning for migration, support needs, or interest in our services for cloud archival of your Urchin server and data, simply contact us.\n\nProspective Buyers\n\nIf you're currently evaluating a purchase of web analytics software, what are your options? Urchin was a great tool for in-house, software-based analytics and we think the analytics world is a little worse off without it around. That said, there are a few options for you to consider:\n\nBuy Urchin now, before it's too late. Now that future plans for Urchin are crystal clear, you can make an informed decision about purchase, taking into account the future for the software. Why buy a software platform that's going into retirement? Well, as I discussed above, we wouldn't call \"retirement\" of Urchin the end. It will be the software it is today as long as it runs. The only area where is is likely to become unusable is with AdWords API integration. If you really need this capability, you probably shouldn't be using Urchin for it anyway (Google Analytics is just plain way better for this). Details about purchase options can be found here.\n\nGo Google. Chances are you or some other area within your organization already uses Google Analytics. GA is extremely deep and powerful and can do just about everything Urchin can (and much more) with only a few areas where it falls short (logfile analysis of server-side errors being the chief shortcoming). Our services team are experts in making Google Analytics meet client needs, so perhaps GA is a viable option once it is fully setup to your organizations needs.\n\nLook for another option. Urchin isn't the only show in town. There are other options out there, however the list of analytics software providers has dwindled sharply in recent years. There are some open-source options, and some paid options. At the time of this writing we do not have a list of strong Urchin alternatives available, but we are working on researching and vetting comparable platforms and will be sure to share those as soon as we have it available.\n\nIf you have any questions about Urchin's discontinuation, buying before the sales cut-off, or interest in Google Analytics standard or premium, simply contact us.\n\nIn Closing - Thanks to the Urchin Team at Google\n\nWhile we are all sad to see an end come to the Urchin era, we are thankful for what Urchin has been and appreciate the work of those at Google who have advanced the product line over the last 7 years. Thank you!",
      "# [Results | Twiddy & Company | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/twiddy-company)\nSince its start in 1978, Twiddy & Company has provided visitors to North Carolina’s Outer Banks with a personal slice of classic southern hospitality. The family-owned vacation group offers more than 1,000 rental homes throughout the area to vacationers and manages the entire rental process from routine property upkeep to greeting guests during check-in. After more than 40 years in business, the Twiddy recipe of regional knowledge combined with premium customer service had already produced a lot of success for the company, but the Twiddy team knew they could take the business further.\n\nThe company had always maintained a sizable database that included years’ worth of past customer bookings but only kept this information around in archival storage that was rarely accessed. Twiddy needed a way to access and analyze visitor data and identify, connect with and convert potential customers for its vacation rentals.\n\nWe implemented Google Cloud giving Twiddy a powerful platform that connects data points with offline information, such as phone bookings and call times, to unlock in-depth marketing insights on customer behavior that drive growth.\n\nBigQuery provides a highly secure hub for the platform’s analytics processing needs. Twiddy only needs a single developer to run the platform and can even have non-IT staff pull data directly from the warehouse when needed, producing additional time and cost savings. Google Apps Script helps automate web query sourcing for BigQuery, while Data Studio powers data visualization for the platform, allowing property owners to better understand data such as listing traffic and conversion rates. This also gives Twiddy team members a real-time look at which homes and weeks are converting.\n\nApps Script automatically generates Sheets files that save team members time on data entry and analysis and give them real-time information for more informed customer interactions and improved customer experiences.\n\nBy working with us to build its analytics strategy on Google Cloud, Twiddy has transformed how it understands and reaches out to customers. Previously, Twiddy relied on calling customers based on collected rental histories, but by using its data warehouse, the company can better understand a customer’s specific interests and show them vacation properties that fit their exact needs.\n\nFor instance, one targeted landing page that sent exclusive deals to site visitors who searched for properties in a specific price range produced a 17% percent jump in email click-throughs compared to standard Twiddy marketing emails. Informed experimentation like this also yielded success across other campaigns thanks to the enhanced accessibility of data related to countless variables.\n\nWeb user behavior data from Google Analytics, as well as offline data, is imported into BigQuery, where it’s stored and processed. All of this vital information further informs Twiddy’s various approaches to marketing and guest services.\n\nWith intelligent campaigns and other new analytics capabilities powered by Adswerve and Google Cloud Platform, Twiddy also saw its sales close rate increase by an impressive 200%, a 36 percent year-over-year increase in transactions and site browsing session length, along with a conversation rate boost of 76 percent and 31 percent higher revenues, within campaigns."

I appreciate inserting analytics code in a webpage can be tested easily, but how about when you're using a GA4 measurement ID on a site you can't insert/mbed code (e.g. within substack).

I'm a frontend dev working for an agency and a number of clients, and as would be expected, we are now beginning to implement a lot more custom metrics in GA4. \n\nMy question is: Assuming we do *not* have access to the GA4 dashboard/login itself, is there a way I can view GA4 events in the Chrome Dev Tools? For UA events, I could look at the \\`collect\\` calls in the Network tab, or I could use the \"Google Analytics Debugger\" Chrome extension and see logs in the console. I've tried the \"Debugger for Google Analytics 4\" extension and am having no luck, or mixed luck at best (not seeing any custom metrics at all, but some page view events and whatnot). \n\nAny help or insight would be greatly appreciated!

Have never used this tool. This could be something to explore. As I mentioned elsewhere, it's more of a workflow issue, as I'd love for something to log right in my face or in the console as I click around a site to check buttons, links, add to carts, etc. This is intriguing and I'll def give it a proper look, but the idea of having to open up this additional window in a fresh incognito window (when I'm testing changes) in order to see events in a separate tab feels a little clunky.

The issue is more around workflow. I work with a lot of ecommerce companies, so I'm checking a lot of custom metrics on button/link clicks, modals opening, adds to cart, etc., and having these actions logged out in front of me as I click around the site would be ideal. Also, I won't be able to check the dataLayer if a link click navigates me away from the current page (unless the link allows me to cmd+click to open a new tab, but that's still annoying). May toy with writing my own little solution to leverage the dataLayer.\n\nAlso not seeing any GA4 calls in the Network tab filtered by \"google\" or the measurement ID. :shrug:\n\nI'm still learning, so I may totally be screwing something up haha!

Ads with Click Tracker A got approved, Ads with Click Tracker B got rejected (\"malicious software\"). We figured that they do not like click tracker B so we removed the click tracking redirect and had people land directly on the landing page.\n\nThey rejected the 2 new ads (4 rejected due to \"malicious software\" in total out of 6 submitted) and then the whole Partner ID got suspended due to \"Circumventing systems policies\" without having bought a single impression. \n\nOnly after this did we get feedback from DV360 support that there is a specific domain that is in the LP related to Click Tracker B that they deemed \"malware\" and wanted removed. That was removed from the LP and new ads using Click Tracker B posted to Adswerve's internal test account did properly get approved\n\nWe immediately appealed as recommended by Adswerve. 20 days later Adswerve inform us that Google has decided to keep the suspension:\n\n\"...*the context they were suspended by 'mistake' unfortunately does not meet our criteria of a reasonable appeal.”*\n\n*“DV360  has detected malware or suspicious activity within Advertiser's  account. Based on signals, we believe their intent was to violate  Google’s Abusive Experiences policies by cloaking or concealing their  ads' true destination and/or behavior and evade our policy review  systems.”*\n\nAdswerve says it is what it is and there is nothing that could be done.   \n\n\nThis sounds so ridiculous that it is unbelievable.

The ads were flagged as malware because of pixels on the landing page iirc. Have adswerve loop in their google account team to conduct a manual review and they should be able to tell you if the landing page is safe and approved by google. Be prepared to receive the same rejection error even after google approves the ads, and take screenshots of any errors you receive and solves you attempt on your end.\n\n### Comment ID jxsxjix with +1 score by [(gambino4nat, Reddit, 2023-08-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1617h6c/dv360_suspended_partner_id_any_idea_how_to_get_it/jxsxjix/) (in reply to ID jxrt3h9):\nThanks man.

I’m currently evaluating DSP options for my company and would love to get a demo of the platform or at least a trial run to test it out. Posting this here as this thread seems to get more daily action than the programmatic one. Any help/thoughts would be appreciated.\n\n## Comment ID f4sbktg with +3 score by [(takethatadops, Reddit, 2019-10-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/dlckqb/dv360_reseller_thoughts/f4sbktg/) (in reply to ID dlckqb):\nAdswerve is a smaller reseller with a bit better rates then some of the larger resellers.\n\n### Comment ID f4t7b5q with +1 score by [(digitaladwarrior, Reddit, 2019-10-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/dlckqb/dv360_reseller_thoughts/f4t7b5q/) (in reply to ID f4sbktg):\nThanks - will def reach out to them\n\n#### Comment ID f4v4fs6 with +1 score by [(scooter700, Reddit, 2019-10-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/dlckqb/dv360_reseller_thoughts/f4v4fs6/) (in reply to ID f4t7b5q):\nI work for Adswerve and we would welcome the opportunity to talk with you further about DV360.

That would help narrow the scope. \n\nMost of the \\*good\\* DSPs have minimums of some sort, whether that is the monthly or annual spend commitment, or minimum per buy. All of the ones you listed have fairly hefty annual commitments, but are mostly recognized as being in the upper class of DSPs in terms of features, inventory, and integrations (DV360 and TTD usually at the very top of that list, as well as for cost.) Others worth mentioning in this class are Basis and Adobe Ad Cloud -- both require commitments. If you can justify an annual commitment of $250k, you can get in the door with Basis, MediaMath, maybe Xandr? \n\nSome of the DSPs have resellers, who can hook you up with a seat without the monstrous commitment. There are a number of them for DV360, but you still need to be spending quite a bit per month to justify it. \n\nA few other lower tier DSPs can still get you a lot of what you want -- depending on what your requirements are. There's always Google Ads as the default -- this gets you display and YouTube. \n\nI really like StackAdapt. No commitments, but is fully featured in a nice UI. Lots of integrations with other platforms. Display, video, native. \n\nPontiac Media is a pretty solid offering. The UI isn't great, but the tech underneath is built upon Xandr, so is fairly robust. It has a small monthly fee of like $25 if you aren't actively spending anything, but otherwise no commitment.\n\n### Comment ID jm8jljf with +5 score by [(doug_kaplan, Reddit, 2023-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/13vw8sy/best_entry_level_dsp/jm8jljf/) (in reply to ID jm8hxcs):\nI second StackAdapt, no minimum monthly spend and no contract so makes it easy to dip your toes in or leave with ease and is fairly full featured.\n\n### Comment ID jmb49lb with +1 score by [(MirsadZ, Reddit, 2023-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/13vw8sy/best_entry_level_dsp/jmb49lb/) (in reply to ID jm8hxcs):\nThanks so much for the detailed explanation.\nFor context we still don't know the exact budget.

On top of that, they charge 15% of commission on your ad budget. \n\nSo you’d want to spend $50k/mo+ to get some minimum amount of value from the platform. \n\nI’d consider scaling your GA campaigns, adding Meta/Linkedin Ads or going for video/content strategies.\n\n## Comment ID kfgepz9 with +1 score by [(New_Contract_1070, Reddit, 2023-12-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/18tr0tn/looking_for_a_seat_at_dv360/kfgepz9/) (in reply to ID 18tr0tn):\nTry a reseller like: AudienceX.

      "# Post ID 180xbte: iFrame Conversion Tracking Workaround with +1 score by [(soundextv, Reddit, 2023-11-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/180xbte/iframe_conversion_tracking_workaround/)\nHi everyone,  \nI am in need of some google tag manager help.  \nI have a booking system installed on a clients website (embedded using an iframe), which operates from a from a third-party website called Cliniko. However, Cliniko has made it difficult to track user's sales conversion whenever a booking is made on our website. Once a booking is made, the page does not reload or redirect to a confirmation page as everything happens within the iframe.\n\n  \nUpon further investigation, we found out that Cliniko blacklisted Google Analytics due to the UK-EU GDPR laws. We, therefore, need to create a workaround, which has partially been made by inserting a listening event script on the page, which is then picked up on Google Tag Manager.\n\n  \nHowever, the issue with that is that we have no way of tracking what service was booked and how much it was. This would pose a problem as we'd be unable to identify how much a campaign has generated in sales conversion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nlet me know if you have any know solution to this headache i'm having. \n\n\n\n## Comment ID ka8phz1 with +1 score by [(AutoModerator, Reddit, 2023-11-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/180xbte/iframe_conversion_tracking_workaround/ka8phz1/) (in reply to ID 180xbte):\nAre you a marketing professional and have 15 minutes to share your insights?

I’ve watched this video 100 times doesn’t work.

Then listening for changes in the 'parent' browser dataLayer. So it would not be an issue of blocking Google Analytics. Could it be that Cliniko is blocking either the postMessage method or maybe Javascript entirely?\n\n## Comment ID kaz1qob with +1 score by [(StefanAtWork, Reddit, 2023-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/180xbte/iframe_conversion_tracking_workaround/kaz1qob/) (in reply to ID 180xbte):\nIf you want to see a real-world implementation of Iframe tracking, see [https://www.theritzlondon.com/](https://www.theritzlondon.com/) and go to the \"Dine With Us\" option and click into e.g. \"The Ritz Restaurant\".\n\nThe Iframe embed contains its own GTM container we were allowed to place there by the booking service provider [www.sevenrooms.com](https://www.sevenrooms.com)\n\nThe GTM container hosts a single Custom HTML tag (fired on All Pages) and that tag was built using the info here: [https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/cookieless-tracking-cross-site-iframes/](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/cookieless-tracking-cross-site-iframes/)\n\nIf you have a suitable debugging extension (AdSwerve dataLayer Inspector+ is great), you'll easily be able to see the events being sent from the Iframe to the \"parent\" GTM, as they are all prefixed with `sriframe.`\n\nThere are still limitations. In this instance Sevenrooms have taken steps to block Click events from firing, so the only events that can be tracked are those created by the booking system itself.\n\n### Comment ID kcdsf5l with +1 score by [(Beneficial_Egg_5465, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/180xbte/iframe_conversion_tracking_workaround/kcdsf5l/) (in reply to ID kaz1qob):\nI have a similar issue with a booking platform called Vagaro. How did they embed the GTM container on the Iframe?   \nIs there a way without contacting the devs of the booking platform ? \\* already contacted them, they said that ga4 can be set up on their platform, but traffic doesn't show as paid\n\n#### Comment ID keav4l6 with +1 score by [(StefanAtWork, Reddit, 2023-12-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/180xbte/iframe_conversion_tracking_workaround/keav4l6/) (in reply to ID kcdsf5l):\nSorry for late reply. Haven't logged into my work Reddit account for 2 weeks.\n\nSevenrooms were happy to add the GTM code snippet to their site (the iframe) for us.\n\nSolution has been in place for many months now and is collecting nice data.\n\nIf Vagaroy can add the GA4 code snippet, I don't see why they couldn't add the GTM code.\n\n## Comment ID kb0iiy9 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/180xbte/iframe_conversion_tracking_workaround/kb0iiy9/) (in reply to ID 180xbte):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID kce7284 with +1 score by [(Beneficial_Egg_5465, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/180xbte/iframe_conversion_tracking_workaround/kce7284/) (in reply to ID kb0iiy9):\nDo you have any resources for a listener code?"

Get used to having someone talk to your boss about you! It squashes any attempt at asking for help out of fear that someone will perceive it as weakness, resulting in termination. \n-High turnover: People disappear under \"suspicious circumstances\" (often at terrible times for client and project health). Executives are not exempt from this either. The company lost their COO and chief salesperson recently, then worked to spin their departure as a coincidence instead of a reflection of the company. Womp womp. \n-Inconsistent and contradictory goal requirements: There is no incentive to do strategic work that could make the company better when all of the company's goals and OKRs are about sales and billable time. Templates for docs like SOWs and legal-approved contracts desperately need overhauling, but no one has time or bandwidth to work on those tasks over client work. \n-Awful clients: Adswerve lives off its relationships with companies like Google and Adobe, so they often get the dregs that can't or won't pay for a real consulting firm. \n-Sneaky HR Practices: I've never heard of a company treating cost-of-living increases as \"merit\" increases.

As you grow within the company hard work is generously rewarded with regular raises and bonuses.  The success of the company is shared with all employees, which is a pretty rare thing these days.  \r\n\r\nWork life balance is a big deal and while an especially busy time or a unique circumstance might have you checking in on something in the evening or on a weekend there's an expectation to leave your work at the office and enjoy your life.  Full-time means 40 hours, which is rare in a lot of agencies where this can be seen as more of a 'starting place'.\r\n\r\nThe holiday parties are a blast, snacks and drinks are provided, ping pong and Nintendo during the slower times.",

This is mostly due to a combination of bottleneck in client work (not enough to go around) as well as preference for skilled workers to be put on client work opposed to ones that don’t have much experience. My feedback here would be to allow the hire to shadow these working sessions and maybe even get them involved in some way so that the opportunity for growth is still there. \n\nThey don’t necessarily have to bill the client for it; but it’ll help facilitate learning as opposed to just being shut out of projects due to lack of skill and being placed on the back burner.\n\n- Sometimes, leadership will have disagreements in what feedback they give to an employee. A director will say one thing whilst approaching employee separately without manager, and a manager will say another in a separate meeting. It’s hard to tell what exactly leadership wants.",

It squashes any attempt at asking for help out of fear that someone will perceive it as weakness, resulting in termination. \n-High turnover: People disappear under \"suspicious circumstances\" (often at terrible times for client and project health). Executives are not exempt from this either. The company lost their COO and chief salesperson recently, then worked to spin their departure as a coincidence instead of a reflection of the company. Womp womp. \n-Inconsistent and contradictory goal requirements: There is no incentive to do strategic work that could make the company better when all of the company's goals and OKRs are about sales and billable time. Templates for docs like SOWs and legal-approved contracts desperately need overhauling, but no one has time or bandwidth to work on those tasks over client work. \n-Awful clients: Adswerve lives off its relationships with companies like Google and Adobe, so they often get the dregs that can't or won't pay for a real consulting firm. \n-Sneaky HR Practices: I've never heard of a company treating cost-of-living increases as \"merit\" increases. This is insulting, especially during a time of record inflation.",

      "# [A New Approach to Attribution: How Marketers Can Adapt by Jake Woodburn on 2024-03-26](https://adswerve.com/blog/a-new-approach-to-attribution-how-marketers-can-adapt)\nIn the ever-evolving digital marketing landscape, staying ahead of the curve is not just an option—it's a necessity. As we sail into the future, the Google Marketing Platform is preparing for a seismic shift in its attribution strategies, setting the stage for a new era in online advertising. Today, we delve into the intricacies of Google's Attribution Odyssey and the impending changes, particularly those involving cookies.\n\nThe Current Attribution Landscape\n\nThe Google Marketing Platform has long been a beacon for marketers seeking accurate and insightful attribution data. The platform's current model relies heavily on cookies, those tiny bits of data that follow users as they traverse the vast landscape of the internet. Cookies have been the unsung heroes, silently collecting information about user interactions and helping marketers understand the customer journey.\n\nHowever, the attribution playbook is about to undergo a rewrite.\n\nThe Cookie Chronicles\n\nEnter the era of change. As privacy concerns gain prominence and regulatory landscapes shift, cookies face increased scrutiny. Google is poised to respond with a series of platform changes designed to prioritize user privacy without sacrificing the quality of attribution data.\n\nThe Sunset of Third-Party Cookies\n\nGoogle has announced plans to phase out third-party cookies on its Chrome browser in 2024. This move aims to bolster user privacy by limiting cross-site tracking, but it also prompts marketers to rethink their attribution strategies.\n\nFirst-Party Data Renaissance\n\nWith third-party cookies on the way out, first-party data becomes more valuable than ever. Google Marketing Platform encourages marketers to cultivate and leverage their first-party data to maintain a robust understanding of user behavior.\n\nAI and Machine Learning Integration\n\nEmbracing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning, Google is enhancing its attribution models. These technologies will play a pivotal role in filling the void left by traditional tracking methods, providing more accurate insights into customer touchpoints.\n\nHow Will Marketers Leverage Tools to Help Them?\n\nThe Privacy Sandbox\n\nMost marketers don’t — and won’t — have access to the Privacy Sandbox. However, they can leverage learnings from it. As the Privacy Sandbox develops more advanced use cases, marketers will gain the ability to replicate some of the current use cases that rely on third-party cookies or other tracking mechanisms. This evolution will enable marketers to continue to leverage sophisticated targeting, attribution and measurement techniques while ensuring greater privacy protection for users. By embracing the Privacy Sandbox outcomes and its innovative solutions, marketers can adapt to the changing digital landscape and maintain effective advertising strategies that respect user privacy preferences.\n\nFor those looking for additional guidance or wanting to explore the Privacy Sandbox, don’t be afraid to seek out additional help. Knowledgeable partners like Adswerve have access to the Privacy Sandbox and can help explore potential solutions tailored to our customers' journey through the evolving digital landscape. A single conversation might be the starting point for clarity and direction. Please reach out if you’re interested in how this could benefit your strategy.\n\nGoogle Attribution Reporting API\n\nThe Google Attribution Reporting API is a programming interface that allows developers to access and retrieve attribution data from Google Ads and other Google marketing products. This API enables users to programmatically access and integrate attribution data, such as conversion metrics and attribution models, into their reporting tools or systems. With the Attribution Reporting API, developers can automate the retrieval of attribution data, allowing for more efficient analysis and reporting of marketing campaign performance across different channels and touchpoints.\n\nMulti-Touch Attribution Models and Marketing Mix Modeling\n\nMulti-touch attribution (MTA) models, especially Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM), will be crucial in navigating digital media attribution's future. MMM is a statistical analysis technique that helps marketers understand the impact of various marketing channels and tactics on overall performance and outcomes, such as sales or conversions.\n\nClients have successfully employed the power of MMM/MTA for a multitude of use cases to understand their digital media performance across various channels. Some real-life examples throughout the last year include guidance for optimizations, bidding and budgeting based on a customer acquisition cost (CAC). Using CAC from multiple data sources, advertisers can gain a more holistic view of their customer acquisition efforts and identify opportunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Use cases may vary by each client’s needs, whether a long-term analysis as the source of truth or a short-term test against other measurement tools.\n\nClient examples utilizing MMM/MTA over the past year have varied — from heavy reliance on the modeled data to dictate monthly budgets based on the impact of ROI from each media channel to head-to-head A/B testing measuring cohort analysis to further understand audience control.\n\nServer Side Tagging in Google Tag Manager\n\nServer-side cookies are cookies set, managed and accessed by a server rather than a user's browser. They are often used with client-side cookies to enhance security, improve performance and manage user sessions more effectively. In the context of first-party data, server-side cookies can be crucial in helping websites and applications collect and manage user data. Advanced use cases of this setup could ultimately help the durability of 1st-party cookies.\n\nPreparing for the Transition\n\nAdapting to the forthcoming changes in the Google Marketing Platform's attribution landscape requires a proactive approach:\n\nEducate Your Team\n\nEnsure that your marketing team is well-versed in the upcoming changes. Understanding the evolving attribution models will empower them to make informed decisions.\n\nAudit Your Data Sources\n\nTake stock of your existing data sources and evaluate their compliance with the changing privacy standards. Diversify your data collection methods and prioritize first-party data.\n\nExplore New Attribution Models\n\nThe Google Marketing Platform is likely to introduce alternative attribution models. Experiment with different approaches to discover what aligns best with your campaign goals and audience.\n\nThe Journey to Come\n\nThe attribution journey is on the brink of a revolution, and Google Marketing Platform is at the helm. By embracing these changes and adapting your strategies accordingly, you can confidently navigate the evolving landscape. As we bid farewell to third-party cookies and usher in a new era of attribution, the key lies in staying agile, informed and ready for the marketing adventures ahead.",

This strategic move enhances Adswerve’s digital marketing capabilities and harnesses the wealth of expertise and cutting-edge technologies developed under MiaProva’s founder, Brian Hawkins.\n\n“We are thrilled to welcome Brian Hawkins and the MiaProva team to Adswerve,” said Roger Berdusco, CEO at Adswerve. “Brian’s leadership and expertise, combined with MiaProva’s innovative technology, strengthens our position as the industry’s premier digital consultancy and ensures our clients continue to unlock the full power of their martech investments.”\n\nHawkins, a seasoned marketing technology professional and former Senior Partner at Analytics Demystified, brings nearly two decades of unparalleled experience, including his pivotal role as an early member of Offermatica, now integrated into Adobe Target. Hawkins is a recognized authority in client success, architecting solutions and advocating best practices in testing technologies for hundreds of organizations. He is also the co-author of the book, “Adobe Target: Classroom in a Book,” and has authored several popular white papers about testing and optimization.\n\nIn addition to Hawkin’s expertise, the acquisition spotlights MiaProva’s proprietary technologies, such as its widely adopted Chrome extension used by nearly two thousand Adobe Target end users and MiaProva’s optimization and personalization management application. With more than 500 enterprise users spread across multiple data centers, the application is a robust optimization solution atop Adobe’s API infrastructure, promoting value-based testing, offering risk-mitigating alerts and a framework centered on program ROI and visibility.\n\n“Joining forces with Adswerve is a natural progression for MiaProva’s growth as an Adobe partner and martech solution provider,” said Brian Hawkins, Co-Founder and CEO of MiaProva. “Our technologies underscore our commitment to optimizing organizations’ testing programs.

      "# [How Connectivity, Community and Creativity Power Adswerve’s Virtual-First Culture by Brigid Hogan on 2023-11-22](https://builtin.com/articles/how-connectivity-community-and-creativity-power-adswerves-virtual-first-culture)\nWhen Nílber Remón logs on to work each day from their home in Brooklyn, they aren't expecting an immediate message from their manager or mentor — they’re each working time zones away in Hawaii and Slovenia, respectively.\n\nAnd while Courtney Reed knows some of her colleagues thrive working in the buzz of a coffee shop or coworking space, she prefers to sit down at the desk in her home office, with a restorative view out of a large window.\n\nFor both Remón, Reed and their colleagues at Adswerve, a virtual-first approach offers more than flexibility — it also helps support a diverse, distributed team by accommodating talent based on geography or work environment.\n\nAt Adswerve, “three Cs” form the foundation for strong culture and thriving teams — connectivity, community and creativity.\n\n“The three Cs are our guiding light to ensure we feel connected no matter our location, role or team, rally around shared interests and spend time together, and solve problems creatively and innovatively,” said CEO Roger Berdusco.\n\nInvesting in a virtual-first environment is crucial to one of Berdusco’s central priorities: making Adswerve a place for every team member to thrive.\n\n“We value our people above all else, so we strive to ensure that all our team members feel welcome, comfortable, excited and proud to be here. The remote work culture is constantly evolving, and my goal is to ensure that Adswerve continues protecting its valued culture through changing workplace trends,” he said. “We seek to bring the best possible people onto our team who will enhance culture, help us live up to our DEI values and meet our high capability standards.”\n\n“My goal is to ensure that Adswerve continues protecting its valued culture through changing workplace trends.”\n\nFor Remón, joining Adswerve as a data engineer was their first foray into virtual work — one that quickly revealed the value of Adswerve’s commitment to connectivity, community and creativity.\n\n“Working from home has provided flexibility around my schedule and facilitated greater autonomy over my time, including focused time in flow when developing software engineering solutions,” they said. “Much of our distributed work has been facilitated by the successful implementation of asynchronous work and communication.”\n\nConnectivity\n\nStaying connected in a distributed environment can be challenging, but keeping connectivity at the heart of company culture and ways of working allows Adswerve’s team to retain a strong sense of belonging.\n\nIn her role as DEI manager, Reed is focused on finding ways to foster that sense of belonging by helping employees build strong ties and thrive personally and professionally while part of the Adswerve team.\n\n“One of the initiatives I am most looking forward to is the launch of our employee resource groups,” she said. “The ERG program will continue to foster an inclusive culture and allow our team to build community across shared identities and interests. When employees feel they belong, they are more engaged, motivated and better equipped to bring their best selves to work everyday.”\n\nAnother project sparking connection at Adswerve is the Spark Initiative, which, according to Berdusco, “provides avenues for our team members to bring new ideas forward for consideration and exploration.” Within the initiative, Berdusco hosts listening sessions to hear from employees, which allows him to hear personally and directly from the Adswerve team.\n\n“We want to empower every employee to seek and voice new ideas — regardless of role, title, or any other label,” he said. “We encourage our team members to listen to each other without judgment and with respect, curiosity, open minds and a willingness to support and advocate for one another.”\n\nCommunity\n\nWithin the regular cadence of life at Adswerve, opportunities to meet and collaborate with team members abound: monthly all-hands and regular in-person and virtual events that include summits, face-to-face department meetings, volunteer opportunities and regional social meetups.\n\n“Adswerve really values opportunities for our team to come together, which leads to enhanced productivity for our team, but we know these connection points are more than just a time to work and achieve our business goals. They allow us to see and feel our company culture come to life,” Reed said.\n\nBeyond the opportunities to come together to build community, Adswerve’s virtual-first approach allows a more diverse and inclusive community to flourish at the company.\n\n“A virtual-first approach allows us to reduce bias in our hiring process, significantly increase our talent pool and create more inclusive meeting structures with a number of accessibility features to support members of our team with disabilities. It also allows us to make the majority of our training and development opportunities accessible to our entire team at their own pace,” Reed noted.\n\nCreativity\n\nWhile working virtually offers Remón the opportunity to find their flow state on their own, Adswerve also creates space for the team to come together in person and build the deep relationships that help support creative collaboration.\n\n“In-person engagements build upon the relationships we’ve developed at a distance and facilitate an unstructured space for conversations, creative outlets and thoughtful interactions. These engagements range from the formal organizational summits to all of the informal, social gatherings in between which foster connections outside the traditional work sphere,” they said.\n\n“In-person engagements build upon the relationships we’ve developed at a distance and facilitate an unstructured space for conversations, creative outlets and thoughtful interactions.”\n\nAccording to Remón, Adswerve’s culture serves to catalyze an atmosphere of diverse ideas in which everyone is encouraged to pursue new interests and explore the edges of their abilities.\n\n“Adswerve actively and intentionally cultivates an engaging learning environment and the space to pursue professional development paths without the enforced siloed specialization endemic to larger-scaled organizations,” they said.\n\nAccording to Reed, setting team members on that path to growth and success at Adswerve starts on day one, and every new hire starts their first day with the tools they need to be successful, a clear path ahead and a buddy to provide mentorship and support along the way.",

      "# [Marketing Automation](https://sp-edge.com/industry/62)\nAdTech and Marketing Campaign Automation remains the most active pieces of the MarTech Stack, while Data & Analytics have witnessed accelerated growth\n\nAdTech and Marketing campaign Automation are the most established parts of the MarTech stack with search engine optimization (SEO) and email marketing remaining staple tools for marketers. With respect to AdTech, while investor interest in SEOs and search engine based marketing has been relatively muted with respect to fund raising activities, adTech tools such as account based marketing (ABM) and ad personalization tools have witnessed growing demand.\n\nIn addition, the Marketing Data & Analytics segment, in particular the CDP subsegment, has been experiencing an accelerated growth in response to the challenges brought about due to new regulations surrounding customer data privacy.\n\nIn contrast, disruptors activity is comparatively low in the marketing intelligence & management segment which typically faces competition from incumbents. Most incumbents position themselves as an all-in-one marketing solution, with a few disruptors compete in this space offering a cheaper and flexible alternative.\n\nERP and CRM giants offer marketing automation as part of their broader offerings\n\nGlobal enterprise resource and planning (ERP) services have been extending the capabilities of their cloud computing platforms to include marketing solutions. Most of these platforms have been pieced together by both in-house developments and acquisitions, offering customers an all-in-one marketing solution. Most firms focus on business-to-business (B2B) solutions while some firms, such as Adobe, Oracle, and SAP, have extended their capabilities into the business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing space. ERP firms tend to have an edge over pure-play MarTech firms (particularly in the B2B space), given their ability to offer an integrated platform that connects to a firm’s sales, operations, accounting, and other functions provided by the ERP.\n\nPopular customer relationship management (CRM) services, such as Salesforce, HubSpot, Sugar CRM, and Zoho, have also introduced solutions specific to marketing. As the unification of sales and marketing roles is a growing trend, CRMs (popular among sales teams) help bridge the information gap between the two teams via a single platform, giving such firms an edge.\n\nSearch engine operators such as Google and Bing (Microsoft), in addition to providing ad placement services, also offer their data analytics platforms. These have access to large customer data reserves for marketing teams. Meanwhile, ecommerce firms like Amazon and social media sites like Facebook have been improving the data analytics capabilities of their products to offer a more complete package.\n\nA note on ad and marketing agencies: Ad and marketing agencies are external firms specializing in providing professional marketing services and have been mainstays in the marketing landscape for decades. Traditional marketing agencies (agencies that focus on traditional media channels and are typically owned by large holding companies) have witnessed a slowdown in their performance, while marketing automation has complemented the services of digital marketing agencies rather than completely replacing them. Many independent digital marketing agencies have positioned themselves to provide complete marketing solutions by developing their in-house marketing automation tools or partnering with marketing automation startups; others specialize in providing strategic consultancy services for marketing. A case in point is the marketing agency 3Q Digital, which provides complete digital market management solutions and strategic consulting.\n\nAnother service offered by marketing agencies is the implementation and training of marketers in the use of marketing automation, which has grown in complexity, while firms have cited a lack of know-how as a barrier to implementation. Adswerve is one such agency, offering a licensed marketing automation platform as well as implementation and onboarding services.\n\nAs such firms do not directly compete with the services offered by startups in the marketing automation space, we have excluded them as incumbents.",
      "# [Twiddy & Company in the News](https://www.twiddy.com/about/press/)\nIn 1978, Doug Twiddy started shucking oysters in the little town of Duck, North Carolina, with a few of his visiting friends. Over time, and as the bonds between them strengthened, his friends would often talk about what it would take to make their dreams of owning a home on North Carolina's Outer Banks come true. Doug built a company around what he heard over these many conversations. Today, Twiddy and Company partners with more than one thousand homeowners and welcomes hundreds of thousands of guests annually to the Outer Banks.\n\nToday's company is a campus-style collection of more than six professional offices that stretch from Duck to Corolla and a dozen historically preserved and active buildings. Most importantly, Twiddy and Company is home to a group of bright individuals who combine world-class professionalism with an authentically local Outer Banks approach. The teams inside of the company work diligently to ensure guests have the knowledge, support, and connections they need to create beautiful memories that last a lifetime.\n\nWhile today's company is noticeably different than the one Doug started more than forty years ago around an oyster shucking table, its values and commitment to delivering southern hospitality to every guest and homeowner remain the same."
