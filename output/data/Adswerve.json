      "# [Results | World Surf League | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/wsl)\nWorld Surf League (WSL) is a digital-first sports league by design because no one knows exactly when the wave conditions will be right. They plan events around a two-week time window at locations around the globe. When the surf is up, the competition begins. Being all-digital allows WSL to publish content fast and stream surfing events as they occur. Fans can use a mobile app to watch live broadcasts and keep up to date with their favorite WSL athletes anywhere, anytime.\n\nAfter consolidating several live events from major surfing brands onto its own video streaming platform, WSL needed better answers to questions about viewership. How many fans engage regularly? How many tune in to multiple events? Who are the superfans — the ones who drive the majority of consumption and engagement— and which new users are most likely to become superfans?\n\nTo better understand fan behavior, WSL began using Google Analytics 360 to gather data from a variety of customer touchpoints and worked with us to accelerate time to value and keep data quality high.\n\nWe combined and cleaned data from Analytics 360, Facebook and WSL’s internal system into a single data lake and modeled superfan attributes using machine learning algorithms. We then applied early engagement attributes of superfans so WSL could focus its marketing on new users.\n\nThe fan insights WSL gained using Google Analytics 360 with Google BigQuery allowed the organization to reduce cost per conversion by more than 50%, which more than doubled the efficiency of ad spend aimed at driving fan engagement and content viewership.\n\nBy focusing on higher ROI customers, WSL drives greater fan engagement with live events and digital content—without increasing its marketing budget. When weather conditions deliver the best waves and large numbers of fans are looking at content, WSL can easily scale its analytics on demand. And during the offseason, it can scale down, which has allowed it to reduce infrastructure costs by 70%.\n\nNow its team can ask more sophisticated questions of its data: How do wave conditions affect viewership? How do athletes’ scores correlate with other factors such as wave height, time of day, or level of competition? And what exactly is a superfan worth to the business?\n\nDownload the full case study.",

I'm a frontend dev working for an agency and a number of clients, and as would be expected, we are now beginning to implement a lot more custom metrics in GA4. \n\nMy question is: Assuming we do *not* have access to the GA4 dashboard/login itself, is there a way I can view GA4 events in the Chrome Dev Tools? For UA events, I could look at the \\`collect\\` calls in the Network tab, or I could use the \"Google Analytics Debugger\" Chrome extension and see logs in the console. I've tried the \"Debugger for Google Analytics 4\" extension and am having no luck, or mixed luck at best (not seeing any custom metrics at all, but some page view events and whatnot). \n\nAny help or insight would be greatly appreciated!

Have never used this tool. This could be something to explore. As I mentioned elsewhere, it's more of a workflow issue, as I'd love for something to log right in my face or in the console as I click around a site to check buttons, links, add to carts, etc. This is intriguing and I'll def give it a proper look, but the idea of having to open up this additional window in a fresh incognito window (when I'm testing changes) in order to see events in a separate tab feels a little clunky. Will 100% give it a run, though!

The issue is more around workflow. I work with a lot of ecommerce companies, so I'm checking a lot of custom metrics on button/link clicks, modals opening, adds to cart, etc., and having these actions logged out in front of me as I click around the site would be ideal. Also, I won't be able to check the dataLayer if a link click navigates me away from the current page (unless the link allows me to cmd+click to open a new tab, but that's still annoying). May toy with writing my own little solution to leverage the dataLayer.\n\nAlso not seeing any GA4 calls in the Network tab filtered by \"google\" or the measurement ID. :shrug:\n\nI'm still learning, so I may totally be screwing something up haha!

We are a GMP reseller, we offer licenses to all Google platforms such as DV360, CM360, SA360 and GA4. CM360 is primarily used for ad serving, trafficking creatives and measurement. Will you be using CM360 to run ads directly with a publisher or will you be using a DSP in tandem? If so are you looking at DV360 or a different DSP? If you want to DM me your information, I'd be happy to pass it along to our sales team who can set up a call with you to go over our offerings! Ultimately, we offer a lot of support services such as 5 hours of platform support per platform license from our Adswerve support team, access to our propriety platform Adswerve Connect which has a vast array of videos and resources to understand all the platform fundamentals and some basic tips and tricks. We also offer media activation for running campaigns hands-on keyboard or offer blocks of hours for consultative support.

So, here are a few things I would try.\n\n- Make sure there isn't anything blocking the firing of GA4, like deferring the JS load or any other site speed attempts. I've seen this happen where it'll track during my testing and all default GA4 events fire, but my custom stuff doesn't. \n\n- Really odd and depends on the site/CMS, but clear any cache on the site as well. You'd think it shouldn't matter since you are using GTM, but I was able to resolve a similar issue by flushing the cache in the CMS. Odd for sure, but it worked. \n\n- If you are talking about \"key events/conversions,\" you need to actually toggle those on. but if they are not firing to begin with, that's a bit more challenging.\n\n- Really, really small thing (but I've done it before, especially if you are working with a large amount of sites), double check that the GA4 ID you have in GTM matches the account you except them to be under.

Server-side is great, but it has some limitations. The implementations I've seen all involve double tagging. One set for standard web and another for server-side. Separate ID's.\n\nIt's really your call whether you want to have server-side sending data to a separate measurement ID than the standard web tag, or only have server-side send data to GA4.\n\nYou need to make sure your GA4 configuration tag fires before any other GA4 tags. Google say to fire the config tag using the \"initialization\" trigger, but you can also use tag sequencing on the other GA4 tags to always run the config tag first.\n\nThe measurement ID in your config tag (the one that sends data to server-side) is irrelevant, unless you choose to pass it through from server-side.\n\nI don't. I send a dummy measurement ID and I set the measurement ID myself in the sGTM container.\n\n\"Google Signals\" is apparently not compatible with server-side, so if you want GA4 audience building, you will still need a data stream collecting data using the standard web tag.\n\n### Comment ID ixqrnpt with +3 score by [(Swiss_Mike, Reddit, 2022-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/z4ahh0/serverside_ga4_implementation_question/ixqrnpt/) (in reply to ID ixqgy20):\nThank you for taking the time in responding! Doing some further debug my duplicate event issue is definitely coming from my Web container after i enable \"Send to server container\" on my Web GA4 base tag.\n\nI think my issue is likely linked to me having separate GA4 config tags that were setup in wGTM that are sending Facebook CAPI data to the server using the GA4 client... So likely  i am duplicating the event streaming into sGTM via multiple GA4 config tags .. more debug required.

However, Cliniko has made it difficult to track user's sales conversion whenever a booking is made on our website. Once a booking is made, the page does not reload or redirect to a confirmation page as everything happens within the iframe.\n\n  \nUpon further investigation, we found out that Cliniko blacklisted Google Analytics due to the UK-EU GDPR laws. We, therefore, need to create a workaround, which has partially been made by inserting a listening event script on the page, which is then picked up on Google Tag Manager.\n\n  \nHowever, the issue with that is that we have no way of tracking what service was booked and how much it was. This would pose a problem as we'd be unable to identify how much a campaign has generated in sales conversion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nlet me know if you have any know solution to this headache i'm having. \n\n\n\n## Comment ID lz5juoh with +1 score by [(Alert-Look-8363, Reddit, 2024-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/180xbte/iframe_conversion_tracking_workaround/lz5juoh/) (in reply to ID 180xbte):\nDid you manage to find a solution to this?

That would help narrow the scope. \n\nMost of the \\*good\\* DSPs have minimums of some sort, whether that is the monthly or annual spend commitment, or minimum per buy. All of the ones you listed have fairly hefty annual commitments, but are mostly recognized as being in the upper class of DSPs in terms of features, inventory, and integrations (DV360 and TTD usually at the very top of that list, as well as for cost.) Others worth mentioning in this class are Basis and Adobe Ad Cloud -- both require commitments. If you can justify an annual commitment of $250k, you can get in the door with Basis, MediaMath, maybe Xandr? \n\nSome of the DSPs have resellers, who can hook you up with a seat without the monstrous commitment. There are a number of them for DV360, but you still need to be spending quite a bit per month to justify it. \n\nA few other lower tier DSPs can still get you a lot of what you want -- depending on what your requirements are. There's always Google Ads as the default -- this gets you display and YouTube. \n\nI really like StackAdapt. No commitments, but is fully featured in a nice UI. Lots of integrations with other platforms. Display, video, native. \n\nPontiac Media is a pretty solid offering. The UI isn't great, but the tech underneath is built upon Xandr, so is fairly robust. It has a small monthly fee of like $25 if you aren't actively spending anything, but otherwise no commitment.\n\n### Comment ID jm8jljf with +6 score by [(doug_kaplan, Reddit, 2023-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/13vw8sy/best_entry_level_dsp/jm8jljf/) (in reply to ID jm8hxcs):\nI second StackAdapt, no minimum monthly spend and no contract so makes it easy to dip your toes in or leave with ease and is fairly full featured.\n\n### Comment ID jmb49lb with +1 score by [(MirsadZ, Reddit, 2023-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/13vw8sy/best_entry_level_dsp/jmb49lb/) (in reply to ID jm8hxcs):\nThanks so much for the detailed explanation.\nFor context we still don't know the exact budget.

Management takes every opportunity to stiff people out of bonuses or extra pay for hard work.\n- Middle-to-upper management is also pretty terrible, among the worst I've worked for. I've never worked anywhere that had this many people in positions of power working against their employees.\n- Next to no opportunities for growth aside from company-mandated certifications. Want to take a course to prepare for those certifications? Too bad.\n- VERY political and VERY petty. Make one mistake and you'll be sure to hear about it from your manager who heard about it from someone else's manager.\n- Mediocre pay relative to the amount of work they demand. Adswerve has some real leaders in their fields at the company, but doesn't pay like it.\n- Ridiculous bonus structure. 1% pay raise for stellar performance during record inflation? Cool, thanks.\n- Lip service to diversity and inclusion. Great place to work if you want to just work with a bunch of petty white nerds.\n- Did I mention senior leadership and management? Just the worst. I wish I could give negative stars just for this review.",

I also need to call out the blatantly fake review left on 11/16/24 titled “Great company.” It’s obvious this was written by executives to boost ratings. If you’re going to resort to leaving fake reviews, at least put some effort into making them believable.\n\nOver the past year, the organization has drastically declined, losing any redeeming qualities it once had. The people-first culture we prided ourselves on is now completely absent.\n\nDespite claiming a lack of budget for promotions, leadership decided to allocate funds toward a poorly executed summit. This event was not only meaningless and cheaply run but also a blatant misallocation of resources. The money spent on the summit could have been used for employee bonuses or well-deserved promotions. Instead, it became a waste of time and a demoralizing reminder for employees who were told promotions weren’t feasible due to budget constraints.\n\nMedia leadership implemented one of the most poorly planned and executed reorgs, and the fallout has affected everyone. Morale is at an all-time low, employees are stretched impossibly thin, and micromanagement has become the norm. While reorgs are rarely perfect, this one was carelessly conceived and disastrously implemented, with employees left to bear the brunt of its failure. Many were reassigned to new roles without clarity or job descriptions—an unethical move that created confusion and resentment. Others were left juggling both their previous responsibilities and new, undefined workloads.\n\nTo make matters worse, a major KPI was retroactively increased four months into the year. This left employees scrambling not only to hit an increased target going forward but also to make up for the gap retroactively. The decision lacked fairness, foresight, and consideration\n\nWhile the department’s employees continue to support one another, senior leaders and executives should be deeply ashamed of their actions. Their decisions have left employees overworked, undervalued, and utterly demoralized. \n\nPay is below market rate, leadership is reckless, morale is low, and growth opportunities are scarce.",

Lots of third-hand feedback delivered through your boss because people are too cowardly to say what's on their mind. \n-Clueless, unaccountable leadership: Company touts that they didn't lay anyone off during the pandemic, then lays off 5% of the company last year, then continues to tout that they didn't lay anyone off!\n-Backstabbing Culture: No one is willing to deliver DIRECT feedback. Get used to having someone talk to your boss about you! It squashes any attempt at asking for help out of fear that someone will perceive it as weakness, resulting in termination. \n-High turnover: People disappear under \"suspicious circumstances\" (often at terrible times for client and project health). Executives are not exempt from this either. The company lost their COO and chief salesperson recently, then worked to spin their departure as a coincidence instead of a reflection of the company. Womp womp. \n-Inconsistent and contradictory goal requirements: There is no incentive to do strategic work that could make the company better when all of the company's goals and OKRs are about sales and billable time. Templates for docs like SOWs and legal-approved contracts desperately need overhauling, but no one has time or bandwidth to work on those tasks over client work. \n-Awful clients: Adswerve lives off its relationships with companies like Google and Adobe, so they often get the dregs that can't or won't pay for a real consulting firm. \n-Sneaky HR Practices: I've never heard of a company treating cost-of-living increases as \"merit\" increases. This is insulting, especially during a time of record inflation.",

The amount of knowledge that the staff has is staggering and the environment is one where learning and personal development are built into the foundation of the company.  You'll probably get more knowledge in your first year here than you would in your typical Master's Degree.  The starting pay is competitive and the benefits are the best I've ever had.  As you grow within the company hard work is generously rewarded with regular raises and bonuses.  The success of the company is shared with all employees, which is a pretty rare thing these days.  \r\n\r\nWork life balance is a big deal and while an especially busy time or a unique circumstance might have you checking in on something in the evening or on a weekend there's an expectation to leave your work at the office and enjoy your life.  Full-time means 40 hours, which is rare in a lot of agencies where this can be seen as more of a 'starting place'.\r\n\r\nThe holiday parties are a blast, snacks and drinks are provided, ping pong and Nintendo during the slower times.",

This is only a small issue compared to the bigger issue below which is focused around gaining job experience and growth. \n\n- Extremely slow to grow from an entry-level standpoint and KPI’s for billable hours (1300 per year which isn’t a lot) unable to be met. This is mostly due to a combination of bottleneck in client work (not enough to go around) as well as preference for skilled workers to be put on client work opposed to ones that don’t have much experience. My feedback here would be to allow the hire to shadow these working sessions and maybe even get them involved in some way so that the opportunity for growth is still there. \n\nThey don’t necessarily have to bill the client for it; but it’ll help facilitate learning as opposed to just being shut out of projects due to lack of skill and being placed on the back burner.\n\n- Sometimes, leadership will have disagreements in what feedback they give to an employee. A director will say one thing whilst approaching employee separately without manager, and a manager will say another in a separate meeting. It’s hard to tell what exactly leadership wants.",

Good luck trying to figure out a plan now that you’ve overburdened your employees and caused us to lose trust .",
        "cons": "If I could, I would give this organization zero stars. I also need to call out the blatantly fake review left on 11/16/24 titled “Great company.” It’s obvious this was written by executives to boost ratings. If you’re going to resort to leaving fake reviews, at least put some effort into making them believable.\n\nOver the past year, the organization has drastically declined, losing any redeeming qualities it once had. The people-first culture we prided ourselves on is now completely absent.\n\nDespite claiming a lack of budget for promotions, leadership decided to allocate funds toward a poorly executed summit. This event was not only meaningless and cheaply run but also a blatant misallocation of resources. The money spent on the summit could have been used for employee bonuses or well-deserved promotions. Instead, it became a waste of time and a demoralizing reminder for employees who were told promotions weren’t feasible due to budget constraints.\n\nMedia leadership implemented one of the most poorly planned and executed reorgs, and the fallout has affected everyone. Morale is at an all-time low, employees are stretched impossibly thin, and micromanagement has become the norm. While reorgs are rarely perfect, this one was carelessly conceived and disastrously implemented, with employees left to bear the brunt of its failure. Many were reassigned to new roles without clarity or job descriptions—an unethical move that created confusion and resentment. Others were left juggling both their previous responsibilities and new, undefined workloads.\n\nTo make matters worse, a major KPI was retroactively increased four months into the year. This left employees scrambling not only to hit an increased target going forward but also to make up for the gap retroactively. The decision lacked fairness, foresight, and consideration\n\nWhile the department’s employees continue to support one another, senior leaders and executives should be deeply ashamed of their actions. Their decisions have left employees overworked, undervalued, and utterly demoralized. \n\nPay is below market rate, leadership is reckless, morale is low, and growth opportunities are scarce.",

      "# [A New Approach to Attribution: How Marketers Can Adapt by Jake Woodburn on 2024-03-26](https://adswerve.com/blog/a-new-approach-to-attribution-how-marketers-can-adapt)\nIn the ever-evolving digital marketing landscape, staying ahead of the curve is not just an option—it's a necessity. As we sail into the future, the Google Marketing Platform is preparing for a seismic shift in its attribution strategies, setting the stage for a new era in online advertising. Today, we delve into the intricacies of Google's Attribution Odyssey and the impending changes, particularly those involving cookies.\n\nThe Current Attribution Landscape\n\nThe Google Marketing Platform has long been a beacon for marketers seeking accurate and insightful attribution data. The platform's current model relies heavily on cookies, those tiny bits of data that follow users as they traverse the vast landscape of the internet. Cookies have been the unsung heroes, silently collecting information about user interactions and helping marketers understand the customer journey.\n\nHowever, the attribution playbook is about to undergo a rewrite.\n\nThe Cookie Chronicles\n\nEnter the era of change. As privacy concerns gain prominence and regulatory landscapes shift, cookies face increased scrutiny. Google is poised to respond with a series of platform changes designed to prioritize user privacy without sacrificing the quality of attribution data.\n\nThe Sunset of Third-Party Cookies\n\nGoogle has announced plans to phase out third-party cookies on its Chrome browser in 2024. This move aims to bolster user privacy by limiting cross-site tracking, but it also prompts marketers to rethink their attribution strategies.\n\nFirst-Party Data Renaissance\n\nWith third-party cookies on the way out, first-party data becomes more valuable than ever. Google Marketing Platform encourages marketers to cultivate and leverage their first-party data to maintain a robust understanding of user behavior.\n\nAI and Machine Learning Integration\n\nEmbracing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning, Google is enhancing its attribution models. These technologies will play a pivotal role in filling the void left by traditional tracking methods, providing more accurate insights into customer touchpoints.\n\nHow Will Marketers Leverage Tools to Help Them?\n\nThe Privacy Sandbox\n\nMost marketers don’t — and won’t — have access to the Privacy Sandbox. However, they can leverage learnings from it. As the Privacy Sandbox develops more advanced use cases, marketers will gain the ability to replicate some of the current use cases that rely on third-party cookies or other tracking mechanisms. This evolution will enable marketers to continue to leverage sophisticated targeting, attribution and measurement techniques while ensuring greater privacy protection for users. By embracing the Privacy Sandbox outcomes and its innovative solutions, marketers can adapt to the changing digital landscape and maintain effective advertising strategies that respect user privacy preferences.\n\nFor those looking for additional guidance or wanting to explore the Privacy Sandbox, don’t be afraid to seek out additional help. Knowledgeable partners like Adswerve have access to the Privacy Sandbox and can help explore potential solutions tailored to our customers' journey through the evolving digital landscape. A single conversation might be the starting point for clarity and direction. Please reach out if you’re interested in how this could benefit your strategy.\n\nGoogle Attribution Reporting API\n\nThe Google Attribution Reporting API is a programming interface that allows developers to access and retrieve attribution data from Google Ads and other Google marketing products. This API enables users to programmatically access and integrate attribution data, such as conversion metrics and attribution models, into their reporting tools or systems. With the Attribution Reporting API, developers can automate the retrieval of attribution data, allowing for more efficient analysis and reporting of marketing campaign performance across different channels and touchpoints.\n\nMulti-Touch Attribution Models and Marketing Mix Modeling\n\nMulti-touch attribution (MTA) models, especially Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM), will be crucial in navigating digital media attribution's future. MMM is a statistical analysis technique that helps marketers understand the impact of various marketing channels and tactics on overall performance and outcomes, such as sales or conversions.\n\nClients have successfully employed the power of MMM/MTA for a multitude of use cases to understand their digital media performance across various channels. Some real-life examples throughout the last year include guidance for optimizations, bidding and budgeting based on a customer acquisition cost (CAC). Using CAC from multiple data sources, advertisers can gain a more holistic view of their customer acquisition efforts and identify opportunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Use cases may vary by each client’s needs, whether a long-term analysis as the source of truth or a short-term test against other measurement tools.\n\nClient examples utilizing MMM/MTA over the past year have varied — from heavy reliance on the modeled data to dictate monthly budgets based on the impact of ROI from each media channel to head-to-head A/B testing measuring cohort analysis to further understand audience control.\n\nServer Side Tagging in Google Tag Manager\n\nServer-side cookies are cookies set, managed and accessed by a server rather than a user's browser. They are often used with client-side cookies to enhance security, improve performance and manage user sessions more effectively. In the context of first-party data, server-side cookies can be crucial in helping websites and applications collect and manage user data. Advanced use cases of this setup could ultimately help the durability of 1st-party cookies.\n\nPreparing for the Transition\n\nAdapting to the forthcoming changes in the Google Marketing Platform's attribution landscape requires a proactive approach:\n\nEducate Your Team\n\nEnsure that your marketing team is well-versed in the upcoming changes. Understanding the evolving attribution models will empower them to make informed decisions.\n\nAudit Your Data Sources\n\nTake stock of your existing data sources and evaluate their compliance with the changing privacy standards. Diversify your data collection methods and prioritize first-party data.\n\nExplore New Attribution Models\n\nThe Google Marketing Platform is likely to introduce alternative attribution models. Experiment with different approaches to discover what aligns best with your campaign goals and audience.\n\nThe Journey to Come\n\nThe attribution journey is on the brink of a revolution, and Google Marketing Platform is at the helm. By embracing these changes and adapting your strategies accordingly, you can confidently navigate the evolving landscape. As we bid farewell to third-party cookies and usher in a new era of attribution, the key lies in staying agile, informed and ready for the marketing adventures ahead.",
      "# [Third-Party Cookie Delay: A Reprieve, Not a Respite for Marketers on 2024-04-25](https://adswerve.com/blog/third-party-cookie-delay-a-reprieve-not-a-respite-for-marketers)\nGoogle has pushed back the end of third-party cookies (3PC) in Chrome yet again, with a new target of early 2025. This news offers a sigh of relief for some, but it's crucial to remember this is a delay and not a cancellation. Let's unpack what this means for the industry, and how you can make the most of this reprieve using the additional resources provided below.\n\nA Shifting Timeline\n\nRemember when 2020 was supposed to be the year of the 3PC apocalypse? The industry spoke, and Google listened. Here's the revised timeline:\n\nJanuary 2020: Google initially announced plans to phase out 3PC within two years.\n\nFebruary 2022: The first delay hit, with the sunset pushed to late 2023.\n\nJanuary 2024: The timeline shifted again, targeting a mid-2024 deprecation.\n\nApril 2024: Google’s most recent update places the official end date in early 2025.\n\nWhy the Delay?\n\nTwo key factors contributed to Google's decision:\n\nIndustry Concerns: Marketers and developers expressed a need for more time to adapt and explore alternatives. Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative, designed to replace 3PC tracking, needed further refinement.\n\nRegulatory Scrutiny: Antitrust investigations, particularly from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), prompted Google to address competition concerns before completely phasing out 3PC.\n\nWhat This Means for the Privacy Sandbox Initiatives\n\nWhile the phase-out of third-party cookies (3PC) has been pushed back to early 2025, most initiatives within the Privacy Sandbox, including the Topics API, Protected Audience API and Attribution Reporting API, are still on track for a Q3 2024 rollout.\n\nTesting Time Extended: The delay offers valuable extra time for developers and testers to refine Privacy Sandbox solutions within Chrome. This translates to potentially smoother functionality and a more seamless transition for advertisers when 3PC finally sunsets. Solutions in development include:\n\nEnhanced Cohort Targeting: Refining how advertisers target audience segments based on similar interests or browsing behaviors without relying on individual user identifiers.\n\nImproved Contextual Targeting: Testing methods for analyzing the context of webpages and content to deliver relevant ads without user tracking.\n\nPrivacy-Preserving Attribution: Developing solutions that accurately measure campaign effectiveness while upholding user privacy standards.\n\nIntegration Focus: Expect continued development on integrating these Sandbox solutions with Google Marketing Platform (GMP) products like Display & Video 360 (DV360) and Campaign Manager 360 (CM360). This will ensure a streamlined workflow for managing campaigns after 3PC deprecation.\n\nAddressing Industry Feedback: Google can use the additional time to incorporate valuable industry feedback. This could lead to increased transparency around how the Sandbox works, more open collaboration with stakeholders and potential adjustments to features based on advertiser needs.\n\nBonus time for website owners:\n\nThe delay also offers an advantage for website owners. Here are two proposals where you can take action:\n\nRelated Website Sets (RWS): Do you have a company with websites on multiple domains (e.g., brandx.com and fly-brandx.com) or domains for different countries (such as example.com, example.rs, example.uk, etc.)? RWS lets these sites share cookies. With the delay, you have more time to submit your domains for approval within RWS. Pro Tip: Make sure your domains meet the RWS guidelines before Q3 2024.\n\nCHIPS (SameSite=Lax for Cookies with Partitioned Storage): Do you use embedded services like chat widgets? CHIPS allows these services to use cookies with your main website. The extra time allows you to test and implement CHIPS if it works for your website.\n\n“While 2025 is now the official 3PC end date, acting now is the smart move. At Adswerve, we’re constantly testing solutions that will work best for advertisers and website owners while prioritizing user privacy. We’re also aggressively exploring Privacy Sandbox initiatives and finding ways to best utilize those solutions for our clients. The time for complacency is over; let’s get to work.”\n\n- Luka Cempre, Senior Data Scientist\n\nWhat This Means for Marketers\n\nMore Time to Adapt: This delay offers a valuable window to test and refine cookieless marketing strategies. Focus on collecting first-party (1P) data directly from your users. Integrate this with data from your own systems (like your CMS) to create a powerful, unified customer picture. Leverage user modeling and contextual targeting to deliver relevant experiences, and explore alternative identifiers to enhance your reach.\n\nUrgency Still Exists: While the deadline shifts, the cookieless future is inevitable. Don't get complacent. Prioritize building a sustainable, privacy-first marketing approach.\n\n“The viability of 3PC has been degrading for years. The playbook for how to respond is the same today as it was before this delay. Marketers should continue moving ahead with their plans as if 3rd party cookies are already gone.”\n\n- Jake Winter, Principal Lead\n\nWhat This Means for Agencies\n\nUpskilling Opportunity: Invest in training your team on cookieless solutions, data privacy regulations and alternative targeting methods.\n\nClient Education Is Key: Guide your clients through the upcoming changes and their impact on campaigns.\n\nNew Revenue Streams Emerge: Expertise in 1P data and privacy-compliant measurement can be a valuable asset for agencies.\n\n“Time is a finite thing, and I implore our agency partners to look at the extra time as an opportunity to focus on actioning the long-term plans that pertain to cookie deprecation rather than short-term fixes. Agencies should continue working with their clients to test and learn durable cookieless solutions, so they have more concrete and proven strategies in place when the deadline comes. Keep pushing forward; 2025 will be here faster than we think.”- Kelly Hayes, Director of Account Management, Agency\n\nWhat This Means for The Google Marketing Platform (GMP)\n\nFocus on Privacy Sandbox: Expect to see continued development and testing of Privacy Sandbox integrations within DV360, CM360 and other platforms. These solutions will leverage technologies like Conversion Domains and Floodlight Conversion Categories to help you reach your target audiences effectively while respecting user privacy.\n\n1P Data Takes Center Stage: Look for further development of tools within GMP to streamline 1P data collection and campaign integration. Focus on collaborating with internal teams to gather as much 1P data as possible and leverage GMP for seamless data utilization.\n\nGA4 Remains Central: Expect ongoing development of GA4's functionalities for collecting and analyzing privacy-compliant data. Use the extended timeframe to test and refine existing workflows and explore new possibilities within GA4, including:\n\nSetting up GA4 for media measurement.\n\nEstablishing audience segmentation strategies.\n\nConfiguring BigQuery data exports.\n\nImplementing event-based bidding tactics.\n\n“The net result is unaffected. We were just given a little gift of being able to connect and align more between upcoming Summer PTOs and hectic calendars. We have the opportunity to feel a little less anxious, but media and analytics teams shouldn’t cancel 3PCD-related items like team meetings, roadmap developments or strategy change approvals. Instead, use the given time to double down and really think about what GMP strategies will be the best suited for your goals and needs, rather than rushing to accomplish a baseline ‘good enough’ because there wasn’t enough time.\"\n\n- Mary Kotara, Lead Consultant, Media\n\n“Cookies will live on into 2025, but focusing on your 3PCD readiness shouldn’t change. Taking actionable steps within the respective GMP platforms, dialing in your 1P data strategy and shaping your overall mindset to make sure you’re prepared should remain top priorities.”\n\n- Jeff Collins, Associate Director, Media Activation\n\nA Final Note\n\nWhile Google extends the timeline for phasing out 3PC, it's important to remember that other browsers like Safari and Firefox have already blocked 3PC. Use this delay to your advantage — experiment, build a strong data foundation and emerge from this shift stronger than ever.\n\nDon't wait until the very last minute — the future is now, and it's privacy-focused.\n\n\"This delay gives the industry a brief reprieve, but it doesn’t mean you should slow down or sideline any efforts you have in development. Anything done now to build a 1P data strategy is only going to get you further ahead of the curve!\"\n\n- Lars von Sneidern, Sr. Director of Analytics / Services Product Manager\n\nNeed help developing and executing your strategy for 3PC deprecation?

      "# [Adswerve DataLayer Inspector+ (2024 Version Update) by Adswerve on 2024-11-07](https://adswerve.com/resources/adswerve-datalayer-inspector-plus)\nWe are pleased to launch the latest version of the dataLayer Inspector+.\n\nLatest Version\n\nUpdate Notes: v2024.11.1.1\n\nDue to new restrictions on external script tags in Chrome extensions, the \"Insert GTM Container\" option has been removed from dataLayer Inspector+. Follow these steps to insert a GTM container into a web page with the \"Inject Code\" feature instead:\n\n1) Go to tagmanager.google.com.\n\n2) Under the Admin tab for your container, select \"Install Google Tag Manager.\"\n\n3) As shown in the screenshot below, where it says \"Paste this code as high in the <head> of the page as possible,\" copy just the snippet code content. Note: Do not include <script> or </script>, only the code between them.\n\n4) In the DataLayer Inspector popup, under \"Add Functionality,\" check \"Inject Code.\"\n\n5) Paste the code snippet from Tag Manager into the text box that appears.\n\n6) Click the button to \"Save Settings & Reload.\"\n\nThe GTM container will be inserted until the \"Inject Code\" box is unchecked and \"Save Settings & Reload\" is clicked again. Be sure to do this when you've finished testing.\n\nOverview\n\nWhat is the Inspector+?\n\nThe dataLayer Inspector+ is a Chrome extension that provides real-time, information-rich viewing of data layer activity and Google Analytics hits as they happen in the Developer Tools console. In addition, it has other features that support development and web analytics debugging.\n\nSummary\n\nThe UI packs all the features into a compact, easy-to-use set of options.\n\nAdd functionality\n\nProvides additional abilities beyond the basic features: e.g., intercept the console (show Inspector+ output when console logging is blocked by a site), push events to the data layer, and add code to the page.\n\nControl output\n\nEnhance or hide outputs: e.g., console highlights, specific events, and specific properties.\n\nAdditional options are available under \"Control output\" by expanding the \"Developer Output\" submenu. These include Show Mouse Events, Show Timing, Show postMessage, Show Mutations, and Hide Call Stack.\n\nOther analytics\n\nObserve code and network activity for other analytics implementations: Google Marketing, Facebook, Tealium, Adobe DTM, Adobe Analytics, Segment, GTM Server-Side, and Custom.\n\nHandy links\n\nGet links to relevant documentation and resources.\n\nBasic use\n\nThe badge will indicate current settings with color and short text.\n\n- On\n\n- Off\n\n- Classic Mode\n\n- dataLayer.push\n\n- Code Inserted\n\nConsole output\n\nBanner\n\nHRef\n\nHref is document.location.href at the time the Inspector loads on the page, and could be different from what is in the address bar or what is sent in DL and DP, especially when the page is a Single Page Application (SPA). Shortcut: Clicking on the HRef will take you to the source code in the Sources tab. Similar to right-clicking and selecting View Source, but you can \"Pretty Print\" the source in the developer tools view.\n\nReferrer\n\nThis is document.referrer when the Inspector loads on the page. It may not be the same as seen in the GA hit in the dr parameter. Analytics.js does not include the referrer from the same domain and single page applications Notes: In Single Page Applications (SPA), this banner remains at the top, and the HRef and referrer do not change.\n\nFilter\n\nUse the Tilde (~) to exclude non-Inspector console logs. Make sure you have \"All levels\" selected.\n\nCollapsed banner\n\nIf you'd like to save space in the console, you can select \"Collapse banner\" in the \"Control output\" options. This will hide the hint and filter note.\n\nData Layer Pushes\n\nAnatomy of dataLayer.pushes (and other analytics calls)\n\nSummary - console.groupCollapsed(...)\n\nThe summary includes a logo, brand, object, function, key and value. If there is no event, and multiple keys, \"Object - Expand for details\" is displayed.\n\nDetails\n\nEach push contains details of the push: e.g., stringified object, pointer to the push currently in memory (it will not be there on the next page when preserve log is checked), and the call stack. When showing timing, it will include seconds to the thousandth since Document Start (when the Inspector was first loaded). Uses: See the stringified content of the data layer push. See evaluations when the Summary is not green. Access the Call Stack. See timing when turned on.\n\nObject Pushed (or Arguments)\n\nThe stringified object shows the type of entity pushed to the data layer (Object or Arguments) and a formatted version of the entity (that will be there on the next page, when preserve log is checked, and can be copied and pasted into the console to replay). Use: See the values of the push, even from previous pages.\n\nCurrently in memory\n\nThis is a link to the actual object in memory. The topmost line is accurate for when the object was pushed to the data layer. When you click on the arrow to the left of the object, (after the colon), the object will expand and an information symbol will display. This indicates that the value of the object was evaluated on the click. Notice that the event value in the top line is different from the second line. This is because the event value was modified after the push and before the click.\n\nUses: To see what is in the data layer push when the object is too large or too complex to stringify.\n\nCall stack\n\nLinks to the code that executed from the start to the console.log are shown in the expanded \"Call Stack.\" The top links are inside the Inspector+. The bottom link is to the line of code that initiated the push. The link before function [as push], is to the code that called dataLayer.push. Uses: Understanding where the data layer push comes from or what code initiated the push.\n\nCommon Data Layer pushes\n\nThese pushes are seen on every page when GTM is installed and only once per page. Gotchas: Using these events in a Single Page Application. For example, using gtm.js as a pageview in a SPA will only send a pageview when the page first loads.\n\ngtm.js\n\nPushed from gtm and gtag snippets.\n\ngtm.start is the time the push was made MDN - \"the numeric value corresponding to the current time - the number of milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC with leap seconds ignored.\" The stack is not available when the script runs before the Inspector was loaded.\n\n(function(w,d,s,l,i) {\n\nw[l] = w[l] || [];\n\nw[l].push({\n\n'gtm.start': new Date().getTime(),\n\nevent: 'gtm.js'\n\n});\n\nvar f = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],\n\nj = d.createElement(s),\n\ndl = l != 'dataLayer' ? '&l=' + l : '';\n\nj.defer=true;\n\nj.src= '//www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;\n\nf.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);\n\n})(window,document,'script','gdGlobals','GTM-XXXXX');\n\nGotchas: 1. gtag and gtm pushes look different in the data layer, but are seen as the same in GTM. A data layer push from gtag with Arguments containing js and the date/time will be evaluated by GTM the same as the above event: 'gtm.js'\n\nNeeded data in the hit that isn't there when the event triggers.\n\nUses: Understanding when the GTM Pageview is triggered and, when the call stack is available, seeing the code that pushes the event.\n\ngtm.dom\n\nPushed from GTM when \"The DOMContentLoaded event fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.\" MDN The document object is ready. Uses: When you need to access the DOM.\n\ngtm.load\n\n\"The load event is fired when a resource and its dependent resources have finished loading.\" MDN Gotchas: gtm.load is not a reliable event in some sites, especially publication sites, because resources may load very slowly and sometimes get blocked.\n\nNetwork hits: anatomy of network hits\n\nSummary\n\nThe summary includes a logo, brand, type and more information. The Google Tag ID appears after the event name. The brand and type are color-coded with three levels: green is good, brown is worth noting and red is an error.\n\nData sent\n\nThe stringified object shows the data sent (that will be there on the next page, when preserve log is checked).\n\nEvaluations\n\nGeneral conventions\n\nGreen is good\n\nPageview hit is valid and contains recommended CD(s)\n\nBrown is a notice\n\nPushes should have an event key:\n\nMultiple GTM containers push gtm.js\n\nSnippet not in the head, as per spec\n\nRed is bad\n\nDuplicate Pageviews, dataLayer reset\n\nExamples of evaluations\n\nData Layer Reset\n\nSometimes, data layers are initialized incorrectly, and after data has been pushed to the data layer. When the data layer has data and is reset using syntax like dataLayer = [], and the Inspector is observing the data layer, you will see the following error in the console. NOTE: This evaluation can only happen if the Inspector+ is observing the data layer at the time of the reset.\n\nDemonstration: Inject this code into a site with a dataLayer.\n\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\",(event) => { window.dataLayer = [{stuff: 'stuffing'}] });\n\nGTM Snippet Location\n\nThe GTM snippet should be installed in the HEAD element. If it is not, you’ll see a console log of a notice with a link to the script. You can click the arrow to see the script. Right-click on the script to \"Reveal in Elements Panel\".\n\nGTM and gtag Configuration Evaluated\n\nThese evaluations are in early alpha. The evaluation is done on gtm.load (when all should have been loaded). Sorting through the implementation combinations and the implications is an emerging effort.\n\nMultiple containers using the same data layer\n\nMultiple GTM Containers\n\nControls\n\nInspect\n\nOn/off Auto detect dataLayer\n\nNaming the dataLayer can provide better sequencing of pushes and hits\n\nOptions\n\nClassic Mode\n\nThe Original Version\n\nUse: When you feel nostalgic about the simple days of Digital Analytics.\n\nJSON-ld\n\nAdd Functionality\n\n- .push({})\n\nPushes an object to the dataLayer (or named data layer) when the Inspector+ is loaded on the page. Usually used when testing GTM and the data needs to be in the data layer asap.\n\nTo use, add quoted key (e.g. \"event\") and value (e.g. \"dataLayer-push\") pairs with colon in between, separated by commas for multiple sets.\n\nInject Code\n\nInserts a script tag into the head. The code will run immediately upon insertion.\n\nUse: When you want to add code to the page immediately or on an event. Hint: To delay until the DOM is ready, use addEventListener: e.g.\n\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\",(event) => {\n\n// Do your stuff here: e.g. dataLayer.push…\n\nwindow.dataLayer.push({\n\nevent: 'example-event',\n\nstuff: 'stuffing'\n\n})\n\n});\n\nControl output\n\nCollapse Banner\n\nReduces the space taken up by the banner.\n\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\nUses: When you don’t need to be reminded about the console filter: e.g., a tilde(~) excludes non-Inspector+ console messages.\n\nShow Client ID\n\nAppends the client ID (cid) after the property ID of the pageview hit.\n\nHide Highlights\n\nTurns off the highlights for hits.\n\nUses: When you don't care if you don't see the hits and the highlights distract you.\n\nHide specific events\n\nSometimes developers get verbose with data layer pushes and you may want to ignore one or more events. This uses a Regex match, so you can block multiple events you want with a well-formed regex. Use: Hide data layer push events.\n\nShow hits to a specific property\n\nThis will limit the GA output to one specific property. Use: When there are multiple properties and you are only interested in one.\n\nAdditional options under \"Developer Output\"\n\nShow postMessage\n\nListens to window.message and pushes to the dataLayer the origin, data and the MessageEvent.\n\nUses: Communication monitoring from iFrames is a common use case: e.g., cross-domain tracking, video events and ads.\n\nShow Mutations\n\nSets listeners on the head and body element of the DOM and logs the array of changes when they happen.\n\nUses: Answering the questions \"What is changing, and when is it changing?\"\n\nHide Call Stack\n\nDoes not retrieve and display the call stack in the data layer push details. Use: Declutter the data layer push details.\n\nShow Timing\n\nThe number of seconds since the document start (when the Inspector+ was first loaded), in thousands of seconds.\n\nDoes not retrieve and display the call stack in the dataLayer.push details.\n\nUse: Declutter the dataLayer push details. Show Timing dataLayer.push The number of seconds since the document start (when the Inspector+ was first loaded), in thousands of seconds.\n\nUse: Measure how long it takes for an event to happen or the duration of tag processing: push processing time. The number of milliseconds the code takes to process the push; from push to callback.\n\nNOTE : Both gtag and GTM process data layer pushes.\n\nOther analytics\n\nGoogle Marketing\n\nFloodlight and other Google Marketing hits are displayed in the console.\n\nAdobe _satelite\n\nAdobe's legacy tag management system, Dynamic Tag Manager, is being replaced by Launch. The feature is early Alpha, meaning it’s incomplete and may not be reliable.\n\nAdobe Analytics\n\nLike Google Analytics, Adobe sends tracking hits to their own platform. The Inspector+ will monitor the hits and display them in the console similarly to how GA hits are displayed. The feature is early Alpha, meaning it’s incomplete and may not be reliable.\n\nTealium\n\nThis is a tag management system (TMS) that is agnostic to the analytics platform. The inspector monitors view and link calls and displays the calls in the console, similarly to data layer pushes. This feature is in advanced beta and is planned to be released to the public.\n\nFacebook\n\nLike Google Analytics and Adobe, Facebook sends hits to their own platform. Like GA and Adobe hits, these are displayed in the console.\n\nCustom Analytics\n\nThis feature will add a \"monkey patch\" to a function on an object and when the function is called, it will log to the console something similar to dataLayer.push.
