      "# [Results | World Surf League | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/wsl)\nWorld Surf League (WSL) is a digital-first sports league by design because no one knows exactly when the wave conditions will be right. They plan events around a two-week time window at locations around the globe. When the surf is up, the competition begins. Being all-digital allows WSL to publish content fast and stream surfing events as they occur. Fans can use a mobile app to watch live broadcasts and keep up to date with their favorite WSL athletes anywhere, anytime.\n\nAfter consolidating several live events from major surfing brands onto its own video streaming platform, WSL needed better answers to questions about viewership. How many fans engage regularly? How many tune in to multiple events? Who are the superfans — the ones who drive the majority of consumption and engagement— and which new users are most likely to become superfans?\n\nTo better understand fan behavior, WSL began using Google Analytics 360 to gather data from a variety of customer touchpoints and worked with us to accelerate time to value and keep data quality high.\n\nWe combined and cleaned data from Analytics 360, Facebook and WSL’s internal system into a single data lake and modeled superfan attributes using machine learning algorithms. We then applied early engagement attributes of superfans so WSL could focus its marketing on new users.\n\nThe fan insights WSL gained using Google Analytics 360 with Google BigQuery allowed the organization to reduce cost per conversion by more than 50%, which more than doubled the efficiency of ad spend aimed at driving fan engagement and content viewership.\n\nBy focusing on higher ROI customers, WSL drives greater fan engagement with live events and digital content—without increasing its marketing budget. When weather conditions deliver the best waves and large numbers of fans are looking at content, WSL can easily scale its analytics on demand. And during the offseason, it can scale down, which has allowed it to reduce infrastructure costs by 70%.\n\nNow its team can ask more sophisticated questions of its data: How do wave conditions affect viewership? How do athletes’ scores correlate with other factors such as wave height, time of day, or level of competition? And what exactly is a superfan worth to the business?\n\nDownload the full case study.",

      "# [TikTok’s Potential Ban: What This Means for Your Marketing Strategy on 2025-01-17](https://adswerve.com/blog/tiktoks-potential-ban-what-this-means-for-your-marketing-strategy)\nJanuary 17, 2025\n\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter to get the latest updates in your inbox\n\n(Updated 10/21/2025) The potential ban of TikTok in the US continues to stir uncertainty in the marketing world. Although President Trump recently signed an executive order temporarily holding off the ban for 75 days, marketers remain in limbo as negotiations evolve. With billions of ad dollars at stake, brands and agencies must still consider reallocating budgets and revisiting their channel mix.\n\nAccording to Insider Intelligence, US advertisers spent an estimated $12.34 billion on TikTok in 2024, underscoring its undeniable importance in the digital advertising ecosystem. This significant investment highlights the scale of the challenge marketers face as they navigate this rapidly evolving landscape and seek alternative channels to reach their target audiences.\n\nThis isn't just about losing a single channel; it's about understanding the broader implications for your marketing mix and ensuring your strategies are resilient in the face of uncertainty.\n\nIndustry-Specific Considerations\n\nThe impact of the TikTok ban will vary significantly across industries, with some feeling the pinch more than others. Here's a breakdown of potential consequences:\n\nE-commerce: E-commerce businesses heavily reliant on TikTok for product discovery, influencer marketing, and direct sales will face the most immediate challenges.\n\nFashion & Beauty: These industries have seen significant success on TikTok, leveraging trends, user-generated content and influencer marketing.\n\nTravel & Tourism: TikTok has been a powerful tool for brands to showcase destinations, inspire travel plans and reach younger audiences.\n\nFood & Beverage: Restaurants and food brands have effectively used TikTok to showcase their offerings, engage with customers and generate viral trends.\n\nUnderstanding Your Channel Mix: A Critical First Step\n\nBefore panicking, marketers must take stock of their current situation.\n\nConduct a thorough marketing mix analysis: Assess the performance of all your marketing channels – social media, search, email, display, etc. – and understand their individual contributions to key metrics like website traffic, conversions, and ROI.\n\nUtilize marketing mix modeling (MMM). MMM provides a sophisticated approach to understanding the true impact of each channel. By analyzing historical data and isolating each channel's impact, you gain a clear picture of which channels are driving the most value.\n\nFocus on audience understanding: Deepen your knowledge of your target audience. Where do they spend their time online? What content resonates with them? This data will guide your channel selection and content strategy.\n\nPro Tip: Google Analytics 4’s cross-platform measurement and User-ID capabilities help you track user behavior across websites and apps, providing a holistic view. This helps you identify alternative platforms to reach your audience if TikTok is unavailable.\n\nWhere Will the Ad Dollars Go?\n\nReallocating ad spend requires a strategic approach. While the specific channels will vary depending on your target audience and marketing goals, here are four insights to consider:\n\nConsider Meta and YouTube: According to eMarketer, Meta and YouTube could capture a significant portion of reallocated US TikTok ad dollars. Instagram is projected to be the single largest financial beneficiary, attracting an average of 22.4% of reallocated spend. Facebook is expected to capture 17.1%, while YouTube could see a 10.7% increase in ad revenue.\n\nExplore Emerging Platforms: Explore emerging platforms like Snap or YouTube Shorts, which offer similar short-form video formats and are gaining traction with younger demographics.\n\nPro Tip: YouTube Shorts are now integrated into Google’s Display & Video 360, where you can effortlessly enhance your campaigns by forecasting, reserving and securing guaranteed impressions using the Instant Reserve tool.\n\n\"Over the past year, we've engaged with numerous agencies focused on boosting their clients' presence on YouTube, specifically YouTube TV and YouTube Shorts. This strategic shift puts these agencies in a strong position for immediate success, especially as the TikTok ban looms. With the search for viable alternatives intensifying, YouTube Shorts is emerging as a promising option—particularly for marketers who are encountering difficulties scaling efforts on Meta platforms. For clients who have access to YouTube Shorts, the time to act is now. By embracing proactive experimentation and developing a clear strategy, they can gain a significant edge over competitors who are still uncertain about their short-term direction.\"\n\n- Kelly Hayes, Director of Account Management, Agency\n\nDouble Down on Proven Channels: Prioritize high-performing channels based on your MMM analysis. This might involve increasing spend on Google Ads or Meta platforms to maintain reach and engagement.\n\nEmbrace Flexibility: The social media landscape is constantly evolving. Be prepared to adjust your strategies quickly based on platform changes, algorithm updates and emerging trends.\n\nThe Road Ahead: A Call for Agility\n\nThe TikTok ban serves as a reminder of the dynamic nature of the digital landscape. Marketers who can adapt quickly, leverage data-driven insights and maintain a flexible approach will be best positioned to navigate this evolving environment. Beyond staying agile with your budget, here are three other areas to help you stay ahead:\n\nYour Creative Approach: TikTok’s hallmark is snackable, highly shareable content. If you move campaigns elsewhere, adapt your creative formats, posting cadence and influencer partnerships to align with each platform’s unique style and user expectations.\n\nAudience Segmentation: Gen Z strongly favors short-form, interactive content. If you shift budget away from TikTok, pinpoint where your core demographics are heading and develop updated personas or audience segments for other social platforms.\n\nLean on Your Durable Measurement Solution: By unifying data from search, display, video and social into one ecosystem—such as the Google Marketing Platform (GMP)—you’ll gain holistic visibility, consistent attribution and robust reporting. This empowers you to quickly spotlight other areas of opportunity to reallocate budget without sacrificing performance.\n\nEven with negotiations ongoing, waiting until the last minute can leave your marketing strategy vulnerable. Start evaluating your options now. Schedule a consultation with our team to discover how we can help you pinpoint high-performing channels, optimize your budget, and stay agile in this rapidly evolving landscape.",

      "# Post ID 14x7g7d: Is there a way to view GA4 events in the Chrome Developer Tools? with +1 score by [(maestro_man, Reddit, 2023-07-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleAnalytics/comments/14x7g7d/is_there_a_way_to_view_ga4_events_in_the_chrome/)\nHowdy! I'm a frontend dev working for an agency and a number of clients, and as would be expected, we are now beginning to implement a lot more custom metrics in GA4. \n\nMy question is: Assuming we do *not* have access to the GA4 dashboard/login itself, is there a way I can view GA4 events in the Chrome Dev Tools? For UA events, I could look at the \\`collect\\` calls in the Network tab, or I could use the \"Google Analytics Debugger\" Chrome extension and see logs in the console. I've tried the \"Debugger for Google Analytics 4\" extension and am having no luck, or mixed luck at best (not seeing any custom metrics at all, but some page view events and whatnot). \n\nAny help or insight would be greatly appreciated!

Also, I won't be able to check the dataLayer if a link click navigates me away from the current page (unless the link allows me to cmd+click to open a new tab, but that's still annoying). May toy with writing my own little solution to leverage the dataLayer.\n\nAlso not seeing any GA4 calls in the Network tab filtered by \"google\" or the measurement ID. :shrug:\n\nI'm still learning, so I may totally be screwing something up haha!

However, Cliniko has made it difficult to track user's sales conversion whenever a booking is made on our website. Once a booking is made, the page does not reload or redirect to a confirmation page as everything happens within the iframe.\n\n  \nUpon further investigation, we found out that Cliniko blacklisted Google Analytics due to the UK-EU GDPR laws. We, therefore, need to create a workaround, which has partially been made by inserting a listening event script on the page, which is then picked up on Google Tag Manager.\n\n  \nHowever, the issue with that is that we have no way of tracking what service was booked and how much it was. This would pose a problem as we'd be unable to identify how much a campaign has generated in sales conversion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nlet me know if you have any know solution to this headache i'm having. \n\n\n\n## Comment ID lz5juoh with +1 score by [(Alert-Look-8363, Reddit, 2024-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/180xbte/iframe_conversion_tracking_workaround/lz5juoh/) (in reply to ID 180xbte):\nDid you manage to find a solution to this?

In this instance Sevenrooms have taken steps to block Click events from firing, so the only events that can be tracked are those created by the booking system itself.\n\n### Comment ID kcdsf5l with +1 score by [(Beneficial_Egg_5465, Reddit, 2023-12-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/180xbte/iframe_conversion_tracking_workaround/kcdsf5l/) (in reply to ID kaz1qob):\nI have a similar issue with a booking platform called Vagaro.

That would help narrow the scope. \n\nMost of the \\*good\\* DSPs have minimums of some sort, whether that is the monthly or annual spend commitment, or minimum per buy. All of the ones you listed have fairly hefty annual commitments, but are mostly recognized as being in the upper class of DSPs in terms of features, inventory, and integrations (DV360 and TTD usually at the very top of that list, as well as for cost.) Others worth mentioning in this class are Basis and Adobe Ad Cloud -- both require commitments. If you can justify an annual commitment of $250k, you can get in the door with Basis, MediaMath, maybe Xandr? \n\nSome of the DSPs have resellers, who can hook you up with a seat without the monstrous commitment. There are a number of them for DV360, but you still need to be spending quite a bit per month to justify it. \n\nA few other lower tier DSPs can still get you a lot of what you want -- depending on what your requirements are. There's always Google Ads as the default -- this gets you display and YouTube. \n\nI really like StackAdapt. No commitments, but is fully featured in a nice UI. Lots of integrations with other platforms. Display, video, native. \n\nPontiac Media is a pretty solid offering. The UI isn't great, but the tech underneath is built upon Xandr, so is fairly robust. It has a small monthly fee of like $25 if you aren't actively spending anything, but otherwise no commitment.\n\n### Comment ID jm8jljf with +4 score by [(doug_kaplan, Reddit, 2023-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/13vw8sy/best_entry_level_dsp/jm8jljf/) (in reply to ID jm8hxcs):\nI second StackAdapt, no minimum monthly spend and no contract so makes it easy to dip your toes in or leave with ease and is fairly full featured.\n\n### Comment ID jmb49lb with +1 score by [(MirsadZ, Reddit, 2023-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/13vw8sy/best_entry_level_dsp/jmb49lb/) (in reply to ID jm8hxcs):\nThanks so much for the detailed explanation.\nFor context we still don't know the exact budget.

So, here are a few things I would try.\n\n- Make sure there isn't anything blocking the firing of GA4, like deferring the JS load or any other site speed attempts. I've seen this happen where it'll track during my testing and all default GA4 events fire, but my custom stuff doesn't. \n\n- Really odd and depends on the site/CMS, but clear any cache on the site as well. You'd think it shouldn't matter since you are using GTM, but I was able to resolve a similar issue by flushing the cache in the CMS. Odd for sure, but it worked. \n\n- If you are talking about \"key events/conversions,\" you need to actually toggle those on. but if they are not firing to begin with, that's a bit more challenging.\n\n- Really, really small thing (but I've done it before, especially if you are working with a large amount of sites), double check that the GA4 ID you have in GTM matches the account you except them to be under. Like I said, small, but we've all done that from time to time.\n\nHope that helps and good luck!\n\n## Comment ID lfo5unm with +2 score by [(CO_PC_Parts, Reddit, 2024-07-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/1efqipk/events_from_gtm_not_showing_in_the_ga4_reports/lfo5unm/) (in reply to ID 1efqipk):\nDid you publish the gtm container?

Server-side is great, but it has some limitations. The implementations I've seen all involve double tagging. One set for standard web and another for server-side. Separate ID's.\n\nIt's really your call whether you want to have server-side sending data to a separate measurement ID than the standard web tag, or only have server-side send data to GA4.\n\nYou need to make sure your GA4 configuration tag fires before any other GA4 tags. Google say to fire the config tag using the \"initialization\" trigger, but you can also use tag sequencing on the other GA4 tags to always run the config tag first.\n\nThe measurement ID in your config tag (the one that sends data to server-side) is irrelevant, unless you choose to pass it through from server-side.\n\nI don't. I send a dummy measurement ID and I set the measurement ID myself in the sGTM container.\n\n\"Google Signals\" is apparently not compatible with server-side, so if you want GA4 audience building, you will still need a data stream collecting data using the standard web tag.\n\n### Comment ID ixqrnpt with +3 score by [(Swiss_Mike, Reddit, 2022-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/z4ahh0/serverside_ga4_implementation_question/ixqrnpt/) (in reply to ID ixqgy20):\nThank you for taking the time in responding!

This is not about an analytics platform being able to detect your real identity from your browser session, but about the website already knowing who you are, e.g. because you logged in to your account there. The presenter isn't amazed about the ability to tie analytics data back to individuals, but about now being allowed to do that directly within this Adobe Customer Journey Analytics platform, which is used to combine analytics data with additional data sets.\n\nEven though the presenter has said \"consent\" about three times in that clip, that doesn't mean visitors actually know what's going on. Information about such non-de-identified tracking is often buried multiple levels deep within a cookie consent notice. At least in Europe, I'd have my doubts whether such tracking would really be legal.\n\nI also cannot 100% reconcile the presenter's claims with the current [Adobe Experience Cloud terms](https://www.adobe.com/legal/terms/enterprise-licensing/ec-product-terms.html), most of which have an absolute prohibition against linking analytics data with additional identifying info. But (a) I'm not a lawyer so I might be misinterpreting those terms, and (b) there's a gazillion different Adobe analytics products with slightly different names, and I might have been looking at the wrong ones.\n\n## Comment ID lrgy11n with +48 score by [(link_cleaner_bot, Reddit, 2024-10-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1g1jpps/adobe_found_a_legal_loophole_to_show_user_first/lrgy11n/) (in reply to ID 1g1jpps):\nBeep.

He's stated that many times. It does a join against your CRM, to acquire the PII. The base analytics is only going to have a unique but non-PII user identifier for tracking. So there's no violation of the google analytics or adobe or other tracking ToS or your privacy policy. He went the wrong direction IMHO to claim that somehow it's now \"legal\" to violate those ToS.\n\nThis has existed in many forms for a long time, it's not new. I mean what adobe is bringing here with the user journey feels new, but RUM and other kinds of tools have done this for ages and can attribute all actions to an identified individual.\n\nHe also even states that this is not unlike what you can get with Tableau and PowerBI. (well you wouldn't get the journey from those, I don't think, and he's specifically demoing user journey here.)\n\nYou can even do similar things with simpler tools like Intercom.\n\n## Comment ID lrir96j with +2 score by [(whoopdedo, Reddit, 2024-10-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1g1jpps/adobe_found_a_legal_loophole_to_show_user_first/lrir96j/) (in reply to ID 1g1jpps):\nReminder that Loom uses the videos you upload for AI training with Databricks and OpenAI.\n\n(For that matter, so is Reddit.)\n\n## Comment ID lrha71p with +2 score by [(gba__, Reddit, 2024-10-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1g1jpps/adobe_found_a_legal_loophole_to_show_user_first/lrha71p/) (in reply to ID 1g1jpps):\nDon't they say in the video that they do that based on consent?\n\nIt seems either for people who click \"Agree\" or for those services that claim to have obtained consent from their users...\n\nNot to mention that in many countries no consent would be needed\n\n### Comment ID lrhbab0 with +11 score by [(WantMoreCookies, Reddit, 2024-10-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1g1jpps/adobe_found_a_legal_loophole_to_show_user_first/lrhbab0/) (in reply to ID lrha71p):\nThe “agree” they are referring to is the cookie banners you see in websites that never go into specifics of what you are “agreeing” to. \n\nAlso who’s to say companies are even administering to this rule?

Get used to having someone talk to your boss about you! It squashes any attempt at asking for help out of fear that someone will perceive it as weakness, resulting in termination. \n-High turnover: People disappear under \"suspicious circumstances\" (often at terrible times for client and project health). Executives are not exempt from this either. The company lost their COO and chief salesperson recently, then worked to spin their departure as a coincidence instead of a reflection of the company. Womp womp. \n-Inconsistent and contradictory goal requirements: There is no incentive to do strategic work that could make the company better when all of the company's goals and OKRs are about sales and billable time. Templates for docs like SOWs and legal-approved contracts desperately need overhauling, but no one has time or bandwidth to work on those tasks over client work. \n-Awful clients: Adswerve lives off its relationships with companies like Google and Adobe, so they often get the dregs that can't or won't pay for a real consulting firm. \n-Sneaky HR Practices: I've never heard of a company treating cost-of-living increases as \"merit\" increases. This is insulting, especially during a time of record inflation.",

I also need to call out the blatantly fake review left on 11/16/24 titled “Great company.” It’s obvious this was written by executives to boost ratings. If you’re going to resort to leaving fake reviews, at least put some effort into making them believable.\n\nOver the past year, the organization has drastically declined, losing any redeeming qualities it once had. The people-first culture we prided ourselves on is now completely absent.\n\nDespite claiming a lack of budget for promotions, leadership decided to allocate funds toward a poorly executed summit. This event was not only meaningless and cheaply run but also a blatant misallocation of resources. The money spent on the summit could have been used for employee bonuses or well-deserved promotions. Instead, it became a waste of time and a demoralizing reminder for employees who were told promotions weren’t feasible due to budget constraints.\n\nMedia leadership implemented one of the most poorly planned and executed reorgs, and the fallout has affected everyone. Morale is at an all-time low, employees are stretched impossibly thin, and micromanagement has become the norm. While reorgs are rarely perfect, this one was carelessly conceived and disastrously implemented, with employees left to bear the brunt of its failure. Many were reassigned to new roles without clarity or job descriptions—an unethical move that created confusion and resentment. Others were left juggling both their previous responsibilities and new, undefined workloads.\n\nTo make matters worse, a major KPI was retroactively increased four months into the year. This left employees scrambling not only to hit an increased target going forward but also to make up for the gap retroactively. The decision lacked fairness, foresight, and consideration\n\nWhile the department’s employees continue to support one another, senior leaders and executives should be deeply ashamed of their actions. Their decisions have left employees overworked, undervalued, and utterly demoralized. \n\nPay is below market rate, leadership is reckless, morale is low, and growth opportunities are scarce.",

This will also throw off any career planning you had, so say goodbye to any chance at that promotion that seemed in reach. You aren’t gonna see it!\n- Our top leadership is insufferable. To lay people off weeks before Christmas, drop our yearly performance raises, just to turn around two months into the new year with the great news that we acquired another company….. has anyone looked up the definition of “tone deaf” in their life? To be told that I should be “lucky” to be receiving a 1% raise???

The amount of knowledge that the staff has is staggering and the environment is one where learning and personal development are built into the foundation of the company.  You'll probably get more knowledge in your first year here than you would in your typical Master's Degree.  The starting pay is competitive and the benefits are the best I've ever had.  As you grow within the company hard work is generously rewarded with regular raises and bonuses.  The success of the company is shared with all employees, which is a pretty rare thing these days.  \r\n\r\nWork life balance is a big deal and while an especially busy time or a unique circumstance might have you checking in on something in the evening or on a weekend there's an expectation to leave your work at the office and enjoy your life.  Full-time means 40 hours, which is rare in a lot of agencies where this can be seen as more of a 'starting place'.\r\n\r\nThe holiday parties are a blast, snacks and drinks are provided, ping pong and Nintendo during the slower times.",

We are also rolling out new feedback channels that will give team members additional options in how they share their ideas and opinions. As a company, we find employee feedback highly valuable, and want to ensure that each team member feels comfortable in their ability to share their thoughts and opinions with leadership.",

This is mostly due to a combination of bottleneck in client work (not enough to go around) as well as preference for skilled workers to be put on client work opposed to ones that don’t have much experience. My feedback here would be to allow the hire to shadow these working sessions and maybe even get them involved in some way so that the opportunity for growth is still there. \n\nThey don’t necessarily have to bill the client for it; but it’ll help facilitate learning as opposed to just being shut out of projects due to lack of skill and being placed on the back burner.\n\n- Sometimes, leadership will have disagreements in what feedback they give to an employee. A director will say one thing whilst approaching employee separately without manager, and a manager will say another in a separate meeting. It’s hard to tell what exactly leadership wants.",

This is mostly due to a combination of bottleneck in client work (not enough to go around) as well as preference for skilled workers to be put on client work opposed to ones that don’t have much experience. My feedback here would be to allow the hire to shadow these working sessions and maybe even get them involved in some way so that the opportunity for growth is still there. \n\nThey don’t necessarily have to bill the client for it; but it’ll help facilitate learning as opposed to just being shut out of projects due to lack of skill and being placed on the back burner.\n\n- Sometimes, leadership will have disagreements in what feedback they give to an employee.

Lots of third-hand feedback delivered through your boss because people are too cowardly to say what's on their mind. \n-Clueless, unaccountable leadership: Company touts that they didn't lay anyone off during the pandemic, then lays off 5% of the company last year, then continues to tout that they didn't lay anyone off!\n-Backstabbing Culture: No one is willing to deliver DIRECT feedback. Get used to having someone talk to your boss about you! It squashes any attempt at asking for help out of fear that someone will perceive it as weakness, resulting in termination. \n-High turnover: People disappear under \"suspicious circumstances\" (often at terrible times for client and project health). Executives are not exempt from this either. The company lost their COO and chief salesperson recently, then worked to spin their departure as a coincidence instead of a reflection of the company. Womp womp. \n-Inconsistent and contradictory goal requirements: There is no incentive to do strategic work that could make the company better when all of the company's goals and OKRs are about sales and billable time. Templates for docs like SOWs and legal-approved contracts desperately need overhauling, but no one has time or bandwidth to work on those tasks over client work. \n-Awful clients: Adswerve lives off its relationships with companies like Google and Adobe, so they often get the dregs that can't or won't pay for a real consulting firm. \n-Sneaky HR Practices: I've never heard of a company treating cost-of-living increases as \"merit\" increases. This is insulting, especially during a time of record inflation.",

This will also throw off any career planning you had, so say goodbye to any chance at that promotion that seemed in reach. You aren’t gonna see it!\n- Our top leadership is insufferable. To lay people off weeks before Christmas, drop our yearly performance raises, just to turn around two months into the new year with the great news that we acquired another company….. has anyone looked up the definition of “tone deaf” in their life? To be told that I should be “lucky” to be receiving a 1% raise???

        "cons": "If I could, I would give this organization zero stars. I also need to call out the blatantly fake review left on 11/16/24 titled “Great company.” It’s obvious this was written by executives to boost ratings. If you’re going to resort to leaving fake reviews, at least put some effort into making them believable.\n\nOver the past year, the organization has drastically declined, losing any redeeming qualities it once had. The people-first culture we prided ourselves on is now completely absent.\n\nDespite claiming a lack of budget for promotions, leadership decided to allocate funds toward a poorly executed summit. This event was not only meaningless and cheaply run but also a blatant misallocation of resources. The money spent on the summit could have been used for employee bonuses or well-deserved promotions. Instead, it became a waste of time and a demoralizing reminder for employees who were told promotions weren’t feasible due to budget constraints.\n\nMedia leadership implemented one of the most poorly planned and executed reorgs, and the fallout has affected everyone. Morale is at an all-time low, employees are stretched impossibly thin, and micromanagement has become the norm. While reorgs are rarely perfect, this one was carelessly conceived and disastrously implemented, with employees left to bear the brunt of its failure. Many were reassigned to new roles without clarity or job descriptions—an unethical move that created confusion and resentment. Others were left juggling both their previous responsibilities and new, undefined workloads.\n\nTo make matters worse, a major KPI was retroactively increased four months into the year. This left employees scrambling not only to hit an increased target going forward but also to make up for the gap retroactively. The decision lacked fairness, foresight, and consideration\n\nWhile the department’s employees continue to support one another, senior leaders and executives should be deeply ashamed of their actions. Their decisions have left employees overworked, undervalued, and utterly demoralized. \n\nPay is below market rate, leadership is reckless, morale is low, and growth opportunities are scarce.",

      "# [Third-Party Cookie Delay: A Reprieve, Not a Respite for Marketers on 2024-04-25](https://adswerve.com/blog/third-party-cookie-delay-a-reprieve-not-a-respite-for-marketers)\nGoogle has pushed back the end of third-party cookies (3PC) in Chrome yet again, with a new target of early 2025. This news offers a sigh of relief for some, but it's crucial to remember this is a delay and not a cancellation. Let's unpack what this means for the industry, and how you can make the most of this reprieve using the additional resources provided below.\n\nA Shifting Timeline\n\nRemember when 2020 was supposed to be the year of the 3PC apocalypse? The industry spoke, and Google listened. Here's the revised timeline:\n\nJanuary 2020: Google initially announced plans to phase out 3PC within two years.\n\nFebruary 2022: The first delay hit, with the sunset pushed to late 2023.\n\nJanuary 2024: The timeline shifted again, targeting a mid-2024 deprecation.\n\nApril 2024: Google’s most recent update places the official end date in early 2025.\n\nWhy the Delay?\n\nTwo key factors contributed to Google's decision:\n\nIndustry Concerns: Marketers and developers expressed a need for more time to adapt and explore alternatives. Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative, designed to replace 3PC tracking, needed further refinement.\n\nRegulatory Scrutiny: Antitrust investigations, particularly from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), prompted Google to address competition concerns before completely phasing out 3PC.\n\nWhat This Means for the Privacy Sandbox Initiatives\n\nWhile the phase-out of third-party cookies (3PC) has been pushed back to early 2025, most initiatives within the Privacy Sandbox, including the Topics API, Protected Audience API and Attribution Reporting API, are still on track for a Q3 2024 rollout.\n\nTesting Time Extended: The delay offers valuable extra time for developers and testers to refine Privacy Sandbox solutions within Chrome. This translates to potentially smoother functionality and a more seamless transition for advertisers when 3PC finally sunsets. Solutions in development include:\n\nEnhanced Cohort Targeting: Refining how advertisers target audience segments based on similar interests or browsing behaviors without relying on individual user identifiers.\n\nImproved Contextual Targeting: Testing methods for analyzing the context of webpages and content to deliver relevant ads without user tracking.\n\nPrivacy-Preserving Attribution: Developing solutions that accurately measure campaign effectiveness while upholding user privacy standards.\n\nIntegration Focus: Expect continued development on integrating these Sandbox solutions with Google Marketing Platform (GMP) products like Display & Video 360 (DV360) and Campaign Manager 360 (CM360). This will ensure a streamlined workflow for managing campaigns after 3PC deprecation.\n\nAddressing Industry Feedback: Google can use the additional time to incorporate valuable industry feedback. This could lead to increased transparency around how the Sandbox works, more open collaboration with stakeholders and potential adjustments to features based on advertiser needs.\n\nBonus time for website owners:\n\nThe delay also offers an advantage for website owners. Here are two proposals where you can take action:\n\nRelated Website Sets (RWS): Do you have a company with websites on multiple domains (e.g., brandx.com and fly-brandx.com) or domains for different countries (such as example.com, example.rs, example.uk, etc.)? RWS lets these sites share cookies. With the delay, you have more time to submit your domains for approval within RWS. Pro Tip: Make sure your domains meet the RWS guidelines before Q3 2024.\n\nCHIPS (SameSite=Lax for Cookies with Partitioned Storage): Do you use embedded services like chat widgets? CHIPS allows these services to use cookies with your main website. The extra time allows you to test and implement CHIPS if it works for your website.\n\n“While 2025 is now the official 3PC end date, acting now is the smart move. At Adswerve, we’re constantly testing solutions that will work best for advertisers and website owners while prioritizing user privacy. We’re also aggressively exploring Privacy Sandbox initiatives and finding ways to best utilize those solutions for our clients. The time for complacency is over; let’s get to work.”\n\n- Luka Cempre, Senior Data Scientist\n\nWhat This Means for Marketers\n\nMore Time to Adapt: This delay offers a valuable window to test and refine cookieless marketing strategies. Focus on collecting first-party (1P) data directly from your users. Integrate this with data from your own systems (like your CMS) to create a powerful, unified customer picture. Leverage user modeling and contextual targeting to deliver relevant experiences, and explore alternative identifiers to enhance your reach.\n\nUrgency Still Exists: While the deadline shifts, the cookieless future is inevitable. Don't get complacent. Prioritize building a sustainable, privacy-first marketing approach.\n\n“The viability of 3PC has been degrading for years. The playbook for how to respond is the same today as it was before this delay. Marketers should continue moving ahead with their plans as if 3rd party cookies are already gone.”\n\n- Jake Winter, Principal Lead\n\nWhat This Means for Agencies\n\nUpskilling Opportunity: Invest in training your team on cookieless solutions, data privacy regulations and alternative targeting methods.\n\nClient Education Is Key: Guide your clients through the upcoming changes and their impact on campaigns.\n\nNew Revenue Streams Emerge: Expertise in 1P data and privacy-compliant measurement can be a valuable asset for agencies.\n\n“Time is a finite thing, and I implore our agency partners to look at the extra time as an opportunity to focus on actioning the long-term plans that pertain to cookie deprecation rather than short-term fixes. Agencies should continue working with their clients to test and learn durable cookieless solutions, so they have more concrete and proven strategies in place when the deadline comes. Keep pushing forward; 2025 will be here faster than we think.”- Kelly Hayes, Director of Account Management, Agency\n\nWhat This Means for The Google Marketing Platform (GMP)\n\nFocus on Privacy Sandbox: Expect to see continued development and testing of Privacy Sandbox integrations within DV360, CM360 and other platforms. These solutions will leverage technologies like Conversion Domains and Floodlight Conversion Categories to help you reach your target audiences effectively while respecting user privacy.\n\n1P Data Takes Center Stage: Look for further development of tools within GMP to streamline 1P data collection and campaign integration. Focus on collaborating with internal teams to gather as much 1P data as possible and leverage GMP for seamless data utilization.\n\nGA4 Remains Central: Expect ongoing development of GA4's functionalities for collecting and analyzing privacy-compliant data. Use the extended timeframe to test and refine existing workflows and explore new possibilities within GA4, including:\n\nSetting up GA4 for media measurement.\n\nEstablishing audience segmentation strategies.\n\nConfiguring BigQuery data exports.\n\nImplementing event-based bidding tactics.\n\n“The net result is unaffected. We were just given a little gift of being able to connect and align more between upcoming Summer PTOs and hectic calendars. We have the opportunity to feel a little less anxious, but media and analytics teams shouldn’t cancel 3PCD-related items like team meetings, roadmap developments or strategy change approvals. Instead, use the given time to double down and really think about what GMP strategies will be the best suited for your goals and needs, rather than rushing to accomplish a baseline ‘good enough’ because there wasn’t enough time.\"\n\n- Mary Kotara, Lead Consultant, Media\n\n“Cookies will live on into 2025, but focusing on your 3PCD readiness shouldn’t change. Taking actionable steps within the respective GMP platforms, dialing in your 1P data strategy and shaping your overall mindset to make sure you’re prepared should remain top priorities.”\n\n- Jeff Collins, Associate Director, Media Activation\n\nA Final Note\n\nWhile Google extends the timeline for phasing out 3PC, it's important to remember that other browsers like Safari and Firefox have already blocked 3PC. Use this delay to your advantage — experiment, build a strong data foundation and emerge from this shift stronger than ever.\n\nDon't wait until the very last minute — the future is now, and it's privacy-focused.\n\n\"This delay gives the industry a brief reprieve, but it doesn’t mean you should slow down or sideline any efforts you have in development. Anything done now to build a 1P data strategy is only going to get you further ahead of the curve!\"\n\n- Lars von Sneidern, Sr. Director of Analytics / Services Product Manager\n\nNeed help developing and executing your strategy for 3PC deprecation?

      "# [Giving the Modern Data Stack a Boost With Adobe CJA by Jake Winter on 2024-02-13](https://adswerve.com/blog/giving-the-modern-data-stack-a-boost-with-adobe-cja)\nBeing in the data and analytics field rarely inspires excitement. You can only rearrange data, charts and tables in so many ways before things start to get repetitive. When the latest and greatest hot new skill everyone should learn is SQL (btw happy 50th birthday!), it becomes obvious that real change and innovation is a rare occurrence in this field.\n\nTo that point, a big part of why I get so excited about Adobe Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) is because it may be the most innovative analytics product in the market right now. To be clear, that’s not specific to digital analytics and adjacent tools — that’s all analytics and BI tools.\n\nThe State of the Modern Data Stack\n\nWhy do I feel so strongly? It has a lot to do with the current state of the buzzwordy “modern data stack” and where data teams are currently experiencing challenges. To oversimplify, the modern data stack is the set of tools enabling data warehousing in the cloud.\n\nWith the migration to the cloud, many teams took the opportunity to reassess the classic Extract-Transform-Load pattern, or ETL, to bring data into a data warehouse for analytics use. Instead, many opted to flip the last two steps into ELT. This shortened the path to getting data loaded into the cloud and took advantage of the expanded amount of storage and compute offered by the cloud. Additionally, it offered flexibility by decoupling transformations from the loading of data. In the ETL days, combining columns and applying logic to create a new column involved complicated redeployments of entire pipelines. With ELT, using a tool like dbt, it can be a few SQL updates.\n\nIn the modern data stack, turning raw data into usable data models has become the new gold, but because it requires a high level of domain expertise, it’s also people and process-intensive. This has resulted in the bottleneck moving downstream to the SQL and analytics engineers preparing data for BI use. As data in the cloud proliferates, the questions increase, the mashups of datasets become more complex and there are only so many SQL developers. The reality remains that not everyone who needs insights can learn SQL. Because of this, data exploration, discovery and insight generation haven’t been able to scale with the cloud warehouses.\n\nWhat does any of this have to do with CJA? CJA’s predecessor, Adobe Analytics, is a self-contained, purpose-built digital analytics tool with a built-in data model optimized to rapidly explore and visualize a specific type of data: streaming events from digital experiences, AKA clickstream. Its biggest strength has been a self-service, no-code Workspace user interface that allows analysts and business users to rapidly generate and test hypotheses about user behaviors, uncovering insights across a sprawling clickstream dataset without any knowledge of SQL.\n\nWith CJA, Adobe has blown out the backend of the Adobe Analytics data model and opened it to event datasets of any schema. As long as there is a consistent Person ID and a timestamp, even physical events can be brought in, including appointments, phone calls, in-store purchases, etc. Here, you can start to see where the two worlds of the modern data stack and CJA may converge. By constructing a highly interactive and optimized data model with the sole purpose of rapidly finding relationships between dimensions and metrics, CJA solves a lot of transformation problems. Those relationships are pre-calculated as they’re processed into the data model to keep reading the results performant.\n\nNot all data are events, and CJA is not an answer for those. However, the innovation that it signals is the idea that purpose-built data models can be placed over cloud data warehouses and, without much more than some schema mapping, suck up data and create use case-specific tools to aid rapid data exploration. Additionally, with Amplitude announcing a Snowflake-native version of its tool, it becomes obvious that this is a space that analytics vendors see as an opportunity. Outside of event data and customer journeys, I could see tailored tools for other domains, such as supply chain, people/HR, health care and more.\n\nTransformational Derived Fields\n\nWhere CJA further differentiated itself this past year was with the introduction of derived fields. The feature allows data ingested into the tool’s data model to be transformed on the fly. If you think about the earlier task of combining a few columns and adding some logic, this is the perfect application of derived fields.\n\nIn SQL, if the change is simple enough, it might be able to be done with a view, but it will likely require changes to the data model and a replay. In Adobe Analytics, you can achieve this through some combination of a tag manager or processing rules, but this would only be applied going forward from when you made the change.\n\nIn CJA, using derived fields, this type of transformation is constructed in a drag-and-drop user interface and is fully retroactive and applied instantaneously. You can create your derived field by manipulating other fields within an event using a set of predefined functions and see a live update of how it affects the output. Then, publish it as a dimension or metric for immediate use across the full timeline of events contained within CJA for any user to pick up and use in their analysis. It’s an innovation that’s truly groundbreaking. Use cases that stand out include:\n\nData cleansing\n\nApplying business logic (e.g., marketing channels, product finding method, etc.)\n\nClassifications or data grouping\n\nCombining or parsing data (e.g., URL query strings)\n\nIn the modern data stack context, this feature alone significantly closes the gap in time-to-insight. Data transformations are rarely right the first time and often need to be applied to an entire dataset before an analyst can really see whether they behave as expected. This results in a lot of iterations and time wasted. With the ability to adjust transformations on the fly, fine-tune them and uncover an insight without an engineer or SQL developer, data and analytics teams can both enjoy efficiencies as a result. As a repeatable pattern, it has incredible potential power.\n\nOpportunities for Iteration\n\nAs this space matures, I expect competition to start looking at how each other are approaching the problems and adapting. For example, there is an opportunity with how CJA is currently architected. It currently requires data to be loaded into Adobe Experience Platform in the form of their JSON Schema-based XDM specification. There are a plethora of connectors to facilitate that ingest, but it’s a necessary step. To slot CJA nicely into the ideal data stack, it could connect directly to the cloud data warehouse and consume it into the CJA data model.\n\nAdditionally, those slick, fully retroactive derived fields have limits on the number of times you can apply a function to a single derived field, the number of fields you can evaluate and the number of derived fields in a connection. These limits are to be expected to keep a feature like this performant and don’t significantly impact the majority of transformations. The good news is that the full weight of Adobe’s product and engineering is behind CJA and it’s iterating quickly with new features and optimizations each month.\n\nLastly, this doesn’t replace the need for hardened and vetted data models that serve as the semantic layer for BI tools. Those are necessary for financial and business reporting that requires a higher level of rigor. Instead, CJA can relieve the strain on the teams supporting them, keep them focused on what matters, and divert many of the ad hoc, deep-dive and exploratory tasks to CJA.\n\nConclusion\n\nGoing forward, a tool like Adobe CJA has the potential to be the tip of the spear. Facilitating self-serve and immediate exploration within a purpose-built data model, consuming from the cloud. Being tuned for speed and on-the-fly transformations, it can become a complementary component of the modern data stack. It’s still in a nascent stage and has some kinks to iron out, but the move toward more rapidly visualizing and exploring data in the cloud can be the next big advancement in the field of analytics.",

      "# [Results | Six Flags | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/six-flags)\nEntertainment giant Six Flags operates theme parks and attractions throughout North America. Their marketing team relies heavily on data from its web, app and sales platforms to monitor sales and marketing metrics and make informed decisions about park operations and guest experiences.\n\nSix Flags partnered with Google Cloud and Adswerve for a marketing analytics workshop to help identify untapped opportunities in their data. Through that process, the teams pinpointed an initiative to explore expanding Six Flags’ existing social sentiment initiative.\n\nTheir legacy sentiment tool was limited to providing a high-level brand score and couldn’t connect to Reddit, which was a big ask from senior leadership. Both the marketing team and the C-suite wanted the ability to go deeper to create and monitor scores by park location and key categories so they could better understand what products and experiences visitors enjoy — and uncover friction points they need to act on.\n\nUltimately, the Six Flags marketing team wanted to understand their guests’ perceptions of the brand, parks and customer experience to see what works and what doesn’t — and easily share the findings with the C-suite for visibility, investigation and quick action.\n\nAdswerve got to work, diving into Six Flags' robust social sentiment solution needs. The team uncovered that Six Flags wanted to monitor sentiment in five core categories: entertainment, food & beverage, price, cleanliness, wait times and customer experience for each of its 27 parks across five social platforms: Google Reviews, Trip Advisor, Instagram, Facebook and Reddit. Because Six Flags operates parks in Canada and Mexico, they also needed the ability to translate French and Spanish social posts into English.\n\nAfter thoroughly investigating Six Flags' solution requirements, we began building a new, more robust social sentiment tool. We used Apify to connect the five social sources in Google Cloud Platform’s data warehouse, BigQuery, reducing the need for custom API development and shortening implementation time.\n\nOnce we connected the data, our data engineers leveraged the full power of Google Cloud to automate data pulls, transform data (including translating other languages into English), assign sentiment scores and categories, create trend summaries using generative AI and push the synthesized information to Looker in real time. It all happens from one platform with one SQL query.\n\nSix Flags can now view and share a Looker dashboard that includes overall and park-specific sentiment scores and uses generative AI to surface the top five positive and negative trends in a \"week in review\" summary. They can easily see performance and insights — and the social comments driving them — and monitor them over time.\n\nThe power of this data was realized shortly into the project while the dashboard was still in development. A park approached marketing to update its highly trafficked park homepage, theorizing visitors were unhappy with recent maintenance impacting ride availability. Six Flags marketing was able to quickly validate the topic was trending for the park in the initial data sets and move forward confidently with the site update to better set expectations for visitors. And while seasonality and completed maintenance both play a part, the park has seen fewer negative posts and its customer experience sentiment score climb month-over-month since implementing the change.\n\nToday, Six Flags can easily view and understand overall customer sentiment and drill in by park across the five main performance categories in their Looker dashboard to uncover additional opportunities to improve the customer experience. If sentiment drops in a particular park in a specific category over time, they can explore the reasons and quickly remedy them. Similarly, they can identify why sudden dips or spikes are happening and quantify how critical an issue is by how many people are discussing it. The Six Flags marketing team can also see the immediate impact price changes, new or updated rides, events, seasonality and more have on sentiment in the short and long term, and make appropriate changes to their digital marketing programs, park operations and more.\n\nBeyond providing powerful insights, the new solution saves Six Flags time. What used to be a manual process, taking 15 people two to three hours per week each, is now fully automated, incorporates the latest AI technology and is easily shareable with organization stakeholders.\n\nUp next? Six Flags is entering their busy events season and plans to use the new social sentiment tool to see how national events stack up against park-specific ones. They’ll incorporate their learning into their future events strategy. The team also plans to add X (formerly Twitter) to their selected social platform sources.",

      "# [8 Ways to Maximize Your DV360 CTV Strategy: From Inventory Packages to Netflix Deals and Beyond by Brittany Medina on 2024-09-13](https://adswerve.com/blog/8-ways-to-maximize-your-dv360-ctv-strategy)\nConnected TV (CTV) has been transforming the advertising landscape for years, but as we venture deeper in the second half of 2024, it brings new opportunities that advertisers can’t afford to miss. With more viewers shifting from traditional cable to streaming services, platforms like Display & Video 360 (DV360) offer a unique and dynamic way to engage your target audience on a larger scale. The recent addition of Netflix as premium inventory within DV360 is one of the more recent standout developments, providing a powerful tool to reach consumers in a highly interactive environment.\n\nAs CTV continues to evolve, it’s crucial to develop a comprehensive strategy that includes clear objectives, a well-defined budget and a deep understanding of the available tools and inventory packages. This post is designed to help you navigate the complexities of CTV advertising, from setting strategic goals and budgeting effectively to leveraging advanced targeting options and maximizing cross-device measurement.\n\n1. Set Clear Goals, Budget and Implement High-Funnel Strategies\n\nBefore diving into your CTV campaign, ensure you have clear goals and an appropriate budget. Define what success looks like for your campaign. Are you aiming for brand awareness, user engagement or direct conversions? Once you have your goals set, allocate a budget that aligns with these objectives.\n\nCTV is particularly effective for high-funnel strategies, which focus on increasing awareness and interest. Consider the following metrics for your CTV campaigns:\n\nCompleted View Rate (CVR)\n\nAudible and Visible on Complete (AVOC)\n\nTarget CPM (Cost per Thousand Impressions)\n\nCPV (Cost per View)\n\nReach and Frequency\n\nThese metrics help ensure your ads are seen and heard, maximizing the impact of your brand message.\n\n2. Use High-Level Floodlight Tags for Awareness and Cross-Device Measurement\n\nLeverage high-level floodlight tags, such as those on your home page or product description pages, to track users across devices. This allows you to measure the effectiveness of your CTV ads when users convert on other devices, such as their phones. With cross-device measurement now available in Campaign Manager 360 (CM360) and DV360, you can now capture users who saw your CTV ad and converted or went to your site on any device. Then, if you want to expand beyond awareness and into performance, build a new insertion order that remarkets to users with fresh CTV ads that measure purchases/lower funnel floodlights. Or you can even serve display ads targeting the same home page/description page audience and measuring sales, guiding users further down the funnel.\n\nThis strategy enables the platform to have individual goals by focusing one CTV tactic on awareness while a second CTV (or display tactic) focuses on driving performance, contributing to the campaign's overall efficacy. Think of it similarly to display goals and strategies for prospecting and retargeting, but apply it to CTV.\n\n3. Target Remarketing Ads Effectively\n\nWhen remarketing to an audience, use a high-volume list of users and target the open exchange or private marketplaces (PMPs) rather than individual publishers for broader reach across CTV screens. This approach ensures you reach a larger audience, enhancing the effectiveness of your remarketing efforts.\n\nIf you’re only targeting one publisher, either with a direct Preferred deal or a Programmatic Guaranteed deal, layer your audience on the supply side (if possible). Note: This may incur additional costs, so be sure to ask.\n\n4. Leverage Existing Inventory Packages\n\nInventory packages can simplify the process of buying CTV ads. Here are some recommendations when shopping for inventory:\n\nAlways-0n Run of Network (RON) CTV packages by exchange: These packages provide a wide array of publishers and scalability. They’re ideal for layering audiences from the DSP side.\n\nContextual CTV packages: Tailor your campaigns to specific contexts such as Home & Garden, Travel, or News. This is particularly useful during the political season for election-related ads.\n\nConsider packages from leading providers like Google Ad Manager, FreeWheel, Magnite and Xandr. These providers offer extensive catalogs of packages, including RON deals that encompass numerous publishers, providing broad reach and scale.\n\nWhy would you package all your inventory this way? In summary, leveraging economies of scale in programmatic media and ensuring a large inventory supply are critical for achieving cost efficiency, broader reach, precise targeting and overall better performance in advertising campaigns. By understanding and applying these principles, advertisers can maximize their return on investment, drive substantial growth in their CTV strategies and drive users down the funnel.\n\n5. Create Your Own PMPs or Programmatic Guaranteed Deal\n\nFor more control, create your own Programmatic Guaranteed deal, Preferred deal, or Private Marketplace (PMP) deals. Curate your inventory by:\n\nPublisher/Media Owner: Access to premium content providers like Netflix (see below), Hulu, Disney properties, Warner Brothers media (CNN, Discovery) and HBO (MAX).\n\nCurate custom 1:1 deals with select publishers or networks to reach a specific audience or type of content.\n\nDevice: Target ads on Roku, Samsung TVs and VIZIO TVs.\n\nSee if these providers have any second-party data you can leverage off-the-shelf for more precise audience targeting.\n\nVirtual Multi-Video Programming Distributor: Utilize platforms like Sling TV, YouTube TV and Hulu Live to target cord-cutters who get cable-like content via streaming.\n\nGet more effective reach with multi-channel distributors.\n\nBuyers should break these deals out into their own Line Items or Insertion Orders to keep bidding and reporting clean.\n\nIf you're planning to run a Programmatic Guaranteed deal, be aware of the publisher’s minimum spend requirement. Make sure you account only for pure media spend dollars and not the gross budget to avoid discrepancies. Knowing these details upfront will help you meet the necessary thresholds without any surprises.\n\n6. Tap into Netflix’s Premium Inventory for Maximum Impact\n\nStarting August 1, 2024, DV360 buyers can access Netflix’s direct deal inventory. As a leading streaming platform with a massive, dedicated audience, Netflix offers an unparalleled opportunity to place your brand in front of viewers who are fully engaged in their favorite shows and movies. This addition makes DV360 an even more powerful tool for CTV media buying, providing access to top-tier content that resonates with viewers. Whether your focus is on building brand awareness or driving conversions, integrating Netflix’s inventory into your strategy ensures your ads are seen by a wide and attentive audience.\n\n7. Utilize YouTube TV and YouTube CTV Inventory\n\nYouTube TV offers exclusive access to a wide range of television networks with ad-supported subscription options. DV360 is the only DSP with access to this inventory, providing personalized ads on live TV, on-demand videos and cloud-based DVRs.\n\nFootball season is just around the corner, and only YouTube TV offers NFL’s Sunday Ticket. Take advantage of this by targeting YouTube TV Sports content only. Magnite also now offers Programmatic Guaranteed Live TV sports inventory! This allows buyers to maximize their reach.\n\nFor more affordable CTV ads, differentiate YouTube on CTV devices from YouTube TV. YouTube on CTV devices offers traditional YouTube app content at lower CPMs ($10-$15 range) compared to regular CTV prices ($25-$35 CPM range). This is a great way to dip your toes into CTV at a cost affordable price if you’re new to CTV or are working with a lower budget.\n\n8. Use GA4 Audiences and DV360’s Audience Tools\n\nFor advanced audience targeting, utilize GA4’s predictive and propensity audiences.\n\nPredictive audiences in GA4 use machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and predict future behavior. This allows advertisers to identify segments of users likely to take specific actions, such as making a purchase or returning to the site.\n\nPropensity modeling is a sophisticated analytical approach used to predict the likelihood that a user will take a specific action, such as making a purchase, subscribing to a service or engaging with content. By leveraging data science and machine learning, propensity models allow advertisers to target high-value users more effectively, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of their marketing campaigns.\n\nIf GA4 audiences aren’t available use floodlights or audiences created from floodlight tags for remarketing. Combine these with DV360’s audience expansion tool to increase scale and reach potential customers.\n\nBe sure to layer these audiences on the DSP side when implementing.\n\nWhat Next?\n\nBy adopting these eight strategies, media buyers can significantly enhance their CTV advertising, ensuring that they effectively reach their target audience and achieve campaign objectives. Staying informed about the latest tools, technologies and industry trends is crucial for continuously refining and optimizing your CTV strategy.\n\nStaying up to date on new developments allows buyers to leverage emerging opportunities, tackle challenges and maintain a competitive edge in the dynamic world of CTV advertising. This proactive approach will not only help meet immediate goals but also ensure long-term success and growth in your CTV campaigns.",
