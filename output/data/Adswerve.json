      "# [Results | World Surf League | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/wsl)\nWorld Surf League (WSL) is a digital-first sports league by design because no one knows exactly when the wave conditions will be right. They plan events around a two-week time window at locations around the globe. When the surf is up, the competition begins. Being all-digital allows WSL to publish content fast and stream surfing events as they occur. Fans can use a mobile app to watch live broadcasts and keep up to date with their favorite WSL athletes anywhere, anytime.\n\nAfter consolidating several live events from major surfing brands onto its own video streaming platform, WSL needed better answers to questions about viewership. How many fans engage regularly? How many tune in to multiple events? Who are the superfans — the ones who drive the majority of consumption and engagement— and which new users are most likely to become superfans?\n\nTo better understand fan behavior, WSL began using Google Analytics 360 to gather data from a variety of customer touchpoints and worked with us to accelerate time to value and keep data quality high.\n\nWe combined and cleaned data from Analytics 360, Facebook and WSL’s internal system into a single data lake and modeled superfan attributes using machine learning algorithms. We then applied early engagement attributes of superfans so WSL could focus its marketing on new users.\n\nThe fan insights WSL gained using Google Analytics 360 with Google BigQuery allowed the organization to reduce cost per conversion by more than 50%, which more than doubled the efficiency of ad spend aimed at driving fan engagement and content viewership.\n\nBy focusing on higher ROI customers, WSL drives greater fan engagement with live events and digital content—without increasing its marketing budget. When weather conditions deliver the best waves and large numbers of fans are looking at content, WSL can easily scale its analytics on demand. And during the offseason, it can scale down, which has allowed it to reduce infrastructure costs by 70%.\n\nNow its team can ask more sophisticated questions of its data: How do wave conditions affect viewership? How do athletes’ scores correlate with other factors such as wave height, time of day, or level of competition? And what exactly is a superfan worth to the business?\n\nDownload the full case study.",

      "# [Gannet Case Study by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/gannett)\nGannett, one of the largest publishers of locally based print and digital media in the United States, partnered with Adswerve to better understand audience behavior and identify opportunities to drive memberships and decrease churn. Because membership numbers remain a critical revenue component for media companies, Gannett had three primary goals:\n\nIncrease digital memberships using propensity scoring\n\nIdentify users at risk of unsubscribing and target with interventions to retain them\n\nBuild a recommendation engine to determine the best content to drive action\n\nThe publisher wanted to employ BigQuery as their marketing data warehouse to power machine learning insights and interventions. They also needed to go beyond summary aggregates and use machine learning processing for more detailed analysis.\n\nGannett came to us with the idea of building scoring models to inform what they needed to meet their goals. Armed with this information, Gannett would be able to intercept users with relevant content or actions to increase memberships and retention.\n\nWe collaborated with the strategic development team, headed by VP of Digital Operations and Product Development Chris Biondi, to bring this project to fruition. The project team, led by Director of Corporate Consumer Data Strategy Rich Forsgren, relied on Adswerve team members to help shape and refine the strategy. We approached the initiative with five workstreams: Data Preparation and Exploratory Data Analysis, Propensity Modeling, Churn Modeling, Content Recommendations and Intervention Identification.\n\nNow that the modeling and workflows are set up, Gannett can:\n\nUse propensity scoring to increase digital subscriptions\n\nRetain users at risk of unsubscribing\n\nCreate compelling, targeted content that converts\n\nThe team has a solid foundation for other activities, too, including building and leveraging audiences across the Google Marketing Platform, surfacing new reporting dimensions, and building more real-time scoring to dynamically alter user experiences and develop new content personalization offerings\n\nThe project continues to evolve as the team reviews results.",

For this, they turned to Adswerve to help build a modeling solution that will meet today’s (and tomorrow’s) privacy standards, understand its customers' preferences, and see how to optimally allocate its marketing budget across its many online and offline touchpoints.\n\nUsing Google Cloud technology, Adswerve data scientists built a multifaceted, durable modeling solution to determine which media touchpoints will impact FTD’s revenue the most.\n\nThe FTD data estate is in an advanced state which made it easy for Adswerve to review and validate FTD's Google Analytics dataset and then create, train and optimize a model using Python to help FTD understand how its media spend affects sales and to learn more about its spend allocation across media.\n\nAdswerve’s data scientists also used machine learning (ML) to predict which channels will reach select audiences and allow the FTD team to target its messaging to the right customers at the right times without oversaturation.\n\nOnce the model was up and running, the Adswerve team developed channel attribution, adstock effects, and diminishing returns visualizations for the FTD team to see the insights the model gleaned from the data.\n\nFinally, Adswerve developed a proprietary budget tool that offers FTD weekly model-derived insights with recommended budget allocation. The easy-to-use app is available to FTD’s entire marketing organization and secured using Google Cloud.\n\nWith off-the-shelf MMM products, you can’t see how the models work or customize them, and they often take an enormous amount of time and effort to implement. But using Google Cloud gave Adswerve the power, speed and flexibility to tailor models to FTD’s needs seamlessly.\n\nAbout Mixed Media Models\n\nWith a mixed-media model, you can:\n\nSee how each media channel impacts your target KPIs\n\nUnderstand how media channels perform with a change in spend\n\nEstimate the optimal budget allocation across your media channels\n\nPlus, see how much additional spend will improve channel performance and how long-lasting the effects will be.\n\nAdswerve’s Google Cloud modeling solution delivered value right from the start. When it first tested the modeling solution, FTD determined its television campaign spend wasn’t optimal. Since then, the marketing team has reduced its TV campaign budget by 30% while still reaching the same audience. They were able to reallocate the savings into other channels that had more opportunity to grow.\n\nMoving forward, this new durable technology will drive FTD’s data-informed decisions about media purchasing. Every member of its marketing organization can easily access and seamlessly use Google Cloud’s machine learning models and insights using Adswerve’s app to make quick, revenue-boosting media decisions.",

The company turned to us when it needed to bring it all together and securely house it in one location while streamlining processes.\n\nWe built a marketing data warehouse using BigQuery in Google Cloud, which tied Alaska’s first-party data together across CRM, media and site analytics. Next, we created predictive lifetime value (pLTV) models using Google Cloud AutoML. Then we fed the predictive scores into the Campaign Manager Conversions API. This connection enabled us to use that data in Search Ads 360 and set up an Auction Time Bid Strategy to quickly, predictively and programmatically bid to pLTV.\n\nAlong the way, we uncovered some interesting insights about the values tied to customers’ origin and destination (O&D) airports, travel days, ages, loyalty program membership and more.\n\nUsing the advanced infrastructure and modeling has helped Alaska achieve a higher ROAS. In fact, activating the information across its Google platforms led to a 30% increase in ROAS for O&D campaigns and helped the company earn $1 more per paid search click.",

      "# [Campaign Trafficking Guide on 2018-08-17](https://staging.adswerve.com/trafficking-guide/)\nCampaign Hierarchy Explained\n\nThe Campaign Manager 360 platform consists of a stack of hierarchical levels with the Advertiser sitting on top. An Advertiser can have many Campaigns to represent different strategies. At the Campaign level, your goal is to traffick your media plan to generate Placement Tags to provide to your Publishers who will deliver your ad inventory. The objects included within a Campaign are defined below and are listed in the order that they appear in the Campaign hierarchy.\n\nSites are the websites, networks or mobile apps where ad inventory has been purchased from and can have many Placements assigned to it.\n\nPlacements represent the ad slots that have been purchased with a media buy and can have many Ads assigned to it.\n\nCreatives are the art or creative assets that will be shown to users when an Ad is served. Creative can be shared across Campaigns and assigned to many Ads.\n\nAds serve as a bridge between Placements and Creative and control how or when Creative is served. Ads can have multiple creative versions assigned to it and can be assigned to multiple Placements across different Sites.\n\nTrafficking Workflow\n\nWe recommend to traffick your Campaign following the described workflow to help you stay organized. However, once the process and hierarchy become more familiar, the workflow may be modified to fit the best process for your team.\n\nStep 1: Create a Campaign\n\nCreate the shell of your Campaign that you would like to create under your Advertiser. Each Campaign can have different Placements and Ads for your marketing strategy. The properties define your run dates and can control other default settings to apply to your Campaign.\n\nSelect Campaigns from the navigation bar at the top of CM360.\n\nClick on the New button.\n\nEnter the name for the Campaign.\n\nAssign the Campaign to an Advertiser.\n\nEnter the Campaign Start and End Dates.\n\nCreate a Default Landing Page URL.\n\nClick Save.\n\nStep 2: Create Placements\n\nThe purpose of creating Placements is to represent what was purchased within your media buy. For each Placement that is created, CM360 will generate a code snippet or Placement tag to provide to your Publishers for implementation.\n\nClick on the New button and select Placement.\n\nSelect Current account or Site Directory to access the list of Sites.\n\nSearch and select the Publisher Site from step 2.\n\nEnter a name for the Placement. The name should represent what was purchased within your media buy.\n\nSet all required Placement property settings.\n\nClick Save.\n\nStep 3: Upload Creative\n\nWhen you upload Creative at the Campaign level, it will automatically be added to the Creatives tab at the Advertiser level which allows it to be shared across other Campaigns. We recommend uploading Creatives at the Campaign level using the Batch upload option described below. However, if you need to add existing Creative from your Advertiser to your Campaign, you may use the Add from Advertiser option instead. Learn more about options to upload Creative.\n\nClick on the New button and select Batch upload.\n\nSelect Creative Assets if you have creative files to upload into CM360. You can also choose to batch upload third-party asset URLs.\n\nSelect files to upload.\n\nYou can select multiple files or a .zip file of all your assets. When uploading HTML5 creative, you will be required to upload a .zip file and a backup static image to associate with it.\n\nClick Next.\n\nIf you are uploading a static image of a particular size for the first time, CM360 will prompt you to select Default creative to generate Default Ads. Default Ads are system Ads that can serve if there are no other eligible Ads available. It is recommended to use brand-neutral creative for your Default Creative.\n\nClick Next and Save.\n\nStep 4: Create Ads\n\nAds function as the bridge between your Placements and Creative and control when your creative is served. Create at least 1 Standard Ad for each Placement for CM360 to serve. Learn more about all available Ad types.\n\nClick New and Standard.\n\nEnter a name for the Ad. The naming convention should help you identify the Ad in reporting.\n\nSet the Ad Status to Active.\n\nEnter the Ad Start and End Dates to indicate when the Ad is eligible to serve. It is recommended to set the Ad Start date to the current date to allow for testing.\n\nSet any other desired Ad Delivery properties (optional).\n\nExpand the Creative assignments section and click Edit creative assignments.\n\nSelect the Creative(s) you would like to serve/rotate.\n\nScroll to the right of the Creative name to select or set landing page.\n\nExpand the Placement assignments section and click Edit placement assignments.\n\nSelect the Placement(s) you would like the Ad to serve to.\n\nClick Save.\n\nStep 5: Download tags\n\nExport the relevant Placement Tags to provide to your Publishers for implementation. Export all available tag types to allow your Publishers to select an acceptable tag type.\n\nClick Tags and select Download tags.\n\nSelect Excel as the Format (recommended).\n\nClick Download.\n\nStep 6: Verify Impressions (recommended)\n\nAfter Placement tags have been implemented or tested, we strongly recommend monitoring performance data 24 hours after a Campaign has gone live by viewing reports from Reporting.\n\nHelpful Resources\n\nTo access the Campaign Manager 360 Help Center, please click here.\n\nFor additional training on Campaign Manager 360, please access self-paced modules and certification via the Skillshop.\n\nStay on top of the latest updates by subscribing to the Google Marketing Platform Blog.",

      "# [Results | Six Flags | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/six-flags)\nEntertainment giant Six Flags operates theme parks and attractions throughout North America. Their marketing team relies heavily on data from its web, app and sales platforms to monitor sales and marketing metrics and make informed decisions about park operations and guest experiences.\n\nSix Flags partnered with Google Cloud and Adswerve for a marketing analytics workshop to help identify untapped opportunities in their data. Through that process, the teams pinpointed an initiative to explore expanding Six Flags’ existing social sentiment initiative.\n\nTheir legacy sentiment tool was limited to providing a high-level brand score and couldn’t connect to Reddit, which was a big ask from senior leadership. Both the marketing team and the C-suite wanted the ability to go deeper to create and monitor scores by park location and key categories so they could better understand what products and experiences visitors enjoy — and uncover friction points they need to act on.\n\nUltimately, the Six Flags marketing team wanted to understand their guests’ perceptions of the brand, parks and customer experience to see what works and what doesn’t — and easily share the findings with the C-suite for visibility, investigation and quick action.\n\nAdswerve got to work, diving into Six Flags' robust social sentiment solution needs. The team uncovered that Six Flags wanted to monitor sentiment in five core categories: entertainment, food & beverage, price, cleanliness, wait times and customer experience for each of its 27 parks across five social platforms: Google Reviews, Trip Advisor, Instagram, Facebook and Reddit. Because Six Flags operates parks in Canada and Mexico, they also needed the ability to translate French and Spanish social posts into English.\n\nAfter thoroughly investigating Six Flags' solution requirements, we began building a new, more robust social sentiment tool. We used Amplify to connect the five social sources in Google Cloud Platform’s data warehouse, BigQuery, reducing the need for custom API development and shortening implementation time.\n\nOnce we connected the data, our data engineers leveraged the full power of Google Cloud to automate data pulls, transform data (including translating other languages into English), assign sentiment scores and categories, create trend summaries using generative AI and push the synthesized information to Looker in real time. It all happens from one platform with one SQL query.\n\nSix Flags can now view and share a Looker dashboard that includes overall and park-specific sentiment scores and uses generative AI to surface the top five positive and negative trends in a \"week in review\" summary. They can easily see performance and insights — and the social comments driving them — and monitor them over time.\n\nThe power of this data was realized shortly into the project while the dashboard was still in development. A park approached marketing to update its highly trafficked park homepage, theorizing visitors were unhappy with recent maintenance impacting ride availability. Six Flags marketing was able to quickly validate the topic was trending for the park in the initial data sets and move forward confidently with the site update to better set expectations for visitors. And while seasonality and completed maintenance both play a part, the park has seen fewer negative posts and its customer experience sentiment score climb month-over-month since implementing the change.\n\nToday, Six Flags can easily view and understand overall customer sentiment and drill in by park across the five main performance categories in their Looker dashboard to uncover additional opportunities to improve the customer experience. If sentiment drops in a particular park in a specific category over time, they can explore the reasons and quickly remedy them. Similarly, they can identify why sudden dips or spikes are happening and quantify how critical an issue is by how many people are discussing it. The Six Flags marketing team can also see the immediate impact price changes, new or updated rides, events, seasonality and more have on sentiment in the short and long term, and make appropriate changes to their digital marketing programs, park operations and more.\n\nBeyond providing powerful insights, the new solution saves Six Flags time. What used to be a manual process, taking 15 people two to three hours per week each, is now fully automated, incorporates the latest AI technology and is easily shareable with organization stakeholders.\n\nUp next? Six Flags is entering their busy events season and plans to use the new social sentiment tool to see how national events stack up against park-specific ones. They’ll incorporate their learning into their future events strategy. The team also plans to add X (formerly Twitter) to their selected social platform sources.",
      "# [Case Study - Cedars Sinai by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/cedars-sinai)\nLeveraging Adobe Customer Journey Analytics to Create a Long-Term, Privacy-Safe, Foundation for Omnichannel Analytics and Personalization for Cedars-Sinai\n\nProblem\n\nLeading healthcare organization Cedars-Sinai strives to be at the forefront of care and deliver an exceptional patient experience. This extends to its digital experience and the Cedar’s Consumer Digital Innovation (CDI) team's efforts to advance and innovate its analytics and personalization strategy — a daunting challenge in healthcare due to complex patient privacy requirements.\n\nTo gain deeper insights into patient interactions across various channels, Cedars-Sinai's CDI team sought a modern analytics platform that extends beyond basic product and funnel analytics. They needed a solution that could map consumer and patient journeys across channels and identify specific user segments requiring actionable engagement. Viewing this as a strategic opportunity, the CDI team aimed to find a long-term solution that not only adheres to Cedars-Sinai’s stringent patient privacy requirements but also advances the organization's goal of delivering large-scale, compliant, omnichannel personalization for patients and users.\n\nTo develop this modern analytics infrastructure based on consistent tracking and accurate, HIPAA-compliant data collection across the patient journey, the CDI team selected Adobe’s Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) to replace Adobe Analytics.\n\nWith the platform selected, Cedars-Sinai needed a partner to help implement CJA properly and create consistency across several disparate web properties and mobile applications (website domains, email, MyChart and virtual care, and offline touchpoints, like call centers) and lay the foundation for its long-term omnichannel personalization strategy.\n\n\"We always aimed to transition to a more advanced analytics platform like CJA to bridge the gap between channels, gain better consumer insights, and deliver a more personalized experience while ensuring HIPAA compliance. With Adswerve’s deep expertise in analytics and technology, we’ve had a partner solely focused on delivering that value and helping us keep moving forward.\"\n\nTara Konar\n\nDirector, Technology Development\n\nCedars-Sinai\n\n\"I wanted to leverage the CJA project to develop an analytics strategy that we can really hone in on moving forward. Previously, our attribution strategy was often tied to a project's immediate needs, causing fragmented results in our tracking. Our conversations with Adswerve helped us validate our realizations, gain external feedback and insights to develop and evolve a new tracking strategy and architecture for the future.\"\n\nRyan Achzet\n\nManager, Technology Development\n\nCedars-Sinai\n\nSolution\n\nConsulting with Adobe led the CDI team to connect with potential implementation partners. The team ultimately selected Adswerve to advise on and implement CJA because of the consultancy’s expertise and experience. From the initial conversation to the seamless discovery and scoping process, it was clear that Adswerve could help the CDI team not only implement CJA but also collaborate on the strategic foundation it needed for its long-term plans. Once Adswerve was on board, the teams collaborated to develop and execute a multi-phase implementation plan.\n\nIn phase one, Adswerve served as both a technical and strategic partner to the CDI team. Adswerve completed the initial CJA implementation to connect Cedars-Sinai’s primary domain, five sub-domains and iOS and Android apps, and deliver new insights into the patient journey across their web and app assets.\n\nAdswerve also collaborated to set the foundations for a new data governance strategy at Cedars-Sinai, helping them evolve from disparate systems and tracking approaches to a more holistic strategy. The strategic framework and new tracking documentation were key to implementing CJA to be scalable, consistent and HIPAA-compliant across the organization's tools and teams for years to come. The Adswerve team also helped align workstreams as the CDI team worked in tandem to implement the Adobe Client Data Layer internally.\n\nWith CJA implemented and currently in beta, the CDI team plans to make it the organization’s analytics platform of record in mid-2024. Adswerve will continue partnering with the CDI team to ensure Cedars-Sinai can fully leverage the new tools and insights from phase one as it expands CJA to connect additional domains, the MyChart patient portal and offline sources.\n\n\"We approached the project as a technical team, thinking of it as an implementation engagement, not a strategy-level engagement. But then we saw that the Adswerve team was on it, talking about every specific point and guiding us to discover new things that we hadn't even thought about. That was big for us.\"\n\nTara Konar\n\nDirector, Technology Development\n\nCedars-Sinai\n\n\"I’ve had a really good experience with Adswerve. There is a level of collaboration that does not exist elsewhere that I've really enjoyed. Their dialogue helps us guide our team to arrive at the best solution for Cedars.\"\n\nRyan Achzet\n\nManager, Technology Development\n\nCedars-Sinai\n\n2\n\nWork Streams\n\nMoving in Tandem\n\n1\n\nImplementation\n\nPhase Completed\n\n8\n\nDomains & Apps Integrated\n\n100%\n\nconfidence in\n\nHIPaA COMPLIANce\n\nResults\n\nHaving CJA properly implemented and updated data governance underway allows Cedars-Sinai to collect accurate data across its many web and mobile assets on its journey to full omnichannel analytics and personalization. Cedars can now leverage its data to glean new insights about the user journey — especially between mobile and web — to help it better segment audiences, create more personalized marketing campaigns for patients and guests, and have clearer visibility into performance. And the organization can evolve and mature its tech stack by layering additional tools and technologies on top of CJA, like Adobe Journey Optimizer, which will further its goal to be a leader in delivering scalable, omnichannel, personalized customer experiences.\n\n\"With the strategy and underlying work in place in partnership with Adswerve, we’re in a position to improve reporting and push towards personalization. It sets us up for the next three to five years to easily bring on new tools and leverage CJA capabilities vs. starting from ground zero with each new integration.\"\n\nRyan Achzet\n\nManager, Technology Development\n\nCedars-Sinai\n\n\"I’m excited to leverage CJA to provide deeper insights into the overall patient journey to the organization, which is a very new concept at Cedars, and move forward on our journey of personalization while balancing our requirements around compliance. The deep analytics and technology expertise brought by Adswerve have helped get us to this point, and now we’re in a position to continue innovating and improving.\"\n\nTara Konar\n\nDirector, Technology Development\n\nCedars-Sinai\n\nAll case studies\n\nHave a similar project you'd\n\nlike to talk about?",

      "# Post ID 14x7g7d: Is there a way to view GA4 events in the Chrome Developer Tools? with +1 score by [(maestro_man, Reddit, 2023-07-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleAnalytics/comments/14x7g7d/is_there_a_way_to_view_ga4_events_in_the_chrome/)\nHowdy! I'm a frontend dev working for an agency and a number of clients, and as would be expected, we are now beginning to implement a lot more custom metrics in GA4. \n\nMy question is: Assuming we do *not* have access to the GA4 dashboard/login itself, is there a way I can view GA4 events in the Chrome Dev Tools? For UA events, I could look at the \\`collect\\` calls in the Network tab, or I could use the \"Google Analytics Debugger\" Chrome extension and see logs in the console. I've tried the \"Debugger for Google Analytics 4\" extension and am having no luck, or mixed luck at best (not seeing any custom metrics at all, but some page view events and whatnot). \n\nAny help or insight would be greatly appreciated! Cheers!\n\n\n\n## Comment ID jrm2j6g with +4 score by [(Falcon_nz, Reddit, 2023-07-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleAnalytics/comments/14x7g7d/is_there_a_way_to_view_ga4_events_in_the_chrome/jrm2j6g/) (in reply to ID 14x7g7d):\nI use ga4 debugger extension\n\n### Comment ID kqiho9m with +1 score by [(Frequent_Meeting_743, Reddit, 2024-02-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleAnalytics/comments/14x7g7d/is_there_a_way_to_view_ga4_events_in_the_chrome/kqiho9m/) (in reply to ID jrm2j6g):\nI don't want to use any extension.

Have never used this tool. This could be something to explore. As I mentioned elsewhere, it's more of a workflow issue, as I'd love for something to log right in my face or in the console as I click around a site to check buttons, links, add to carts, etc. This is intriguing and I'll def give it a proper look, but the idea of having to open up this additional window in a fresh incognito window (when I'm testing changes) in order to see events in a separate tab feels a little clunky.

The issue is more around workflow. I work with a lot of ecommerce companies, so I'm checking a lot of custom metrics on button/link clicks, modals opening, adds to cart, etc., and having these actions logged out in front of me as I click around the site would be ideal. Also, I won't be able to check the dataLayer if a link click navigates me away from the current page (unless the link allows me to cmd+click to open a new tab, but that's still annoying). May toy with writing my own little solution to leverage the dataLayer.\n\nAlso not seeing any GA4 calls in the Network tab filtered by \"google\" or the measurement ID. :shrug:\n\nI'm still learning, so I may totally be screwing something up haha!

Ads with Click Tracker A got approved, Ads with Click Tracker B got rejected (\"malicious software\"). We figured that they do not like click tracker B so we removed the click tracking redirect and had people land directly on the landing page.\n\nThey rejected the 2 new ads (4 rejected due to \"malicious software\" in total out of 6 submitted) and then the whole Partner ID got suspended due to \"Circumventing systems policies\" without having bought a single impression. \n\nOnly after this did we get feedback from DV360 support that there is a specific domain that is in the LP related to Click Tracker B that they deemed \"malware\" and wanted removed. That was removed from the LP and new ads using Click Tracker B posted to Adswerve's internal test account did properly get approved\n\nWe immediately appealed as recommended by Adswerve. 20 days later Adswerve inform us that Google has decided to keep the suspension:\n\n\"...*the context they were suspended by 'mistake' unfortunately does not meet our criteria of a reasonable appeal.”*\n\n*“DV360  has detected malware or suspicious activity within Advertiser's  account. Based on signals, we believe their intent was to violate  Google’s Abusive Experiences policies by cloaking or concealing their  ads' true destination and/or behavior and evade our policy review  systems.”*\n\nAdswerve says it is what it is and there is nothing that could be done.   \n\n\nThis sounds so ridiculous that it is unbelievable. Any idea who we could reach out or what we could do to get the Partner ID reinstated and even be able to buy impressions?\n\n## Comment ID jxrt3h9 with +2 score by [(vibepods, Reddit, 2023-08-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1617h6c/dv360_suspended_partner_id_any_idea_how_to_get_it/jxrt3h9/) (in reply to ID 1617h6c):\nThis has happened to me before also through Adswerve and it was like two weeks of back and forth with google, salesforce and adswerve to troubleshoot on Google’s end. The ads were flagged as malware because of pixels on the landing page iirc. Have adswerve loop in their google account team to conduct a manual review and they should be able to tell you if the landing page is safe and approved by google. Be prepared to receive the same rejection error even after google approves the ads, and take screenshots of any errors you receive and solves you attempt on your end.\n\n### Comment ID jxsxjix with +1 score by [(gambino4nat, Reddit, 2023-08-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/1617h6c/dv360_suspended_partner_id_any_idea_how_to_get_it/jxsxjix/) (in reply to ID jxrt3h9):\nThanks man.

Ultimately, we offer a lot of support services such as 5 hours of platform support per platform license from our Adswerve support team, access to our propriety platform Adswerve Connect which has a vast array of videos and resources to understand all the platform fundamentals and some basic tips and tricks.

That would help narrow the scope. \n\nMost of the \\*good\\* DSPs have minimums of some sort, whether that is the monthly or annual spend commitment, or minimum per buy. All of the ones you listed have fairly hefty annual commitments, but are mostly recognized as being in the upper class of DSPs in terms of features, inventory, and integrations (DV360 and TTD usually at the very top of that list, as well as for cost.) Others worth mentioning in this class are Basis and Adobe Ad Cloud -- both require commitments. If you can justify an annual commitment of $250k, you can get in the door with Basis, MediaMath, maybe Xandr? \n\nSome of the DSPs have resellers, who can hook you up with a seat without the monstrous commitment. There are a number of them for DV360, but you still need to be spending quite a bit per month to justify it. \n\nA few other lower tier DSPs can still get you a lot of what you want -- depending on what your requirements are. There's always Google Ads as the default -- this gets you display and YouTube. \n\nI really like StackAdapt. No commitments, but is fully featured in a nice UI. Lots of integrations with other platforms. Display, video, native. \n\nPontiac Media is a pretty solid offering. The UI isn't great, but the tech underneath is built upon Xandr, so is fairly robust. It has a small monthly fee of like $25 if you aren't actively spending anything, but otherwise no commitment.\n\n### Comment ID jm8jljf with +6 score by [(doug_kaplan, Reddit, 2023-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/13vw8sy/best_entry_level_dsp/jm8jljf/) (in reply to ID jm8hxcs):\nI second StackAdapt, no minimum monthly spend and no contract so makes it easy to dip your toes in or leave with ease and is fairly full featured.\n\n### Comment ID jmb49lb with +1 score by [(MirsadZ, Reddit, 2023-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmatic/comments/13vw8sy/best_entry_level_dsp/jmb49lb/) (in reply to ID jm8hxcs):\nThanks so much for the detailed explanation.\nFor context we still don't know the exact budget.

However, Cliniko has made it difficult to track user's sales conversion whenever a booking is made on our website. Once a booking is made, the page does not reload or redirect to a confirmation page as everything happens within the iframe.\n\n  \nUpon further investigation, we found out that Cliniko blacklisted Google Analytics due to the UK-EU GDPR laws. We, therefore, need to create a workaround, which has partially been made by inserting a listening event script on the page, which is then picked up on Google Tag Manager.\n\n  \nHowever, the issue with that is that we have no way of tracking what service was booked and how much it was. This would pose a problem as we'd be unable to identify how much a campaign has generated in sales conversion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nlet me know if you have any know solution to this headache i'm having. \n\n\n\n## Comment ID ka8phz1 with +1 score by [(AutoModerator, Reddit, 2023-11-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/180xbte/iframe_conversion_tracking_workaround/ka8phz1/) (in reply to ID 180xbte):\nAre you a marketing professional and have 15 minutes to share your insights?

Separate ID's.\n\nIt's really your call whether you want to have server-side sending data to a separate measurement ID than the standard web tag, or only have server-side send data to GA4.\n\nYou need to make sure your GA4 configuration tag fires before any other GA4 tags. Google say to fire the config tag using the \"initialization\" trigger, but you can also use tag sequencing on the other GA4 tags to always run the config tag first.\n\nThe measurement ID in your config tag (the one that sends data to server-side) is irrelevant, unless you choose to pass it through from server-side.\n\nI don't. I send a dummy measurement ID and I set the measurement ID myself in the sGTM container.\n\n\"Google Signals\" is apparently not compatible with server-side, so if you want GA4 audience building, you will still need a data stream collecting data using the standard web tag.\n\n### Comment ID ixqrnpt with +3 score by [(Swiss_Mike, Reddit, 2022-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/z4ahh0/serverside_ga4_implementation_question/ixqrnpt/) (in reply to ID ixqgy20):\nThank you for taking the time in responding! Doing some further debug my duplicate event issue is definitely coming from my Web container after i enable \"Send to server container\" on my Web GA4 base tag.\n\nI think my issue is likely linked to me having separate GA4 config tags that were setup in wGTM that are sending Facebook CAPI data to the server using the GA4 client... So likely  i am duplicating the event streaming into sGTM via multiple GA4 config tags .. more debug required. Thanks again\n\n#### Comment ID iy87wmb with +1 score by [(StefanAtWork, Reddit, 2022-11-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/z4ahh0/serverside_ga4_implementation_question/iy87wmb/) (in reply to ID ixqrnpt):\nHow are you getting on with this?

What is the point of that out of curiosity?\n\nIs there any downside to me entering a dummy Measurement ID in the Web tag and only collecting the Server-side events inside a single property ? In-fact isnt there an advantage to it so i can control what i send into GA and how? \n\nFor example one of the markets we operate in (in EU) only allow for GA to be used if done server-side, in that case the answer can only be to only have a valid Measurement ID in the server-side tag, right?\n\nThanks appreciate the help, i'm new to this so trying to sponge it all up!",

Adswerve has some real leaders in their fields at the company, but doesn't pay like it.\n- Ridiculous bonus structure. 1% pay raise for stellar performance during record inflation? Cool, thanks.\n- Lip service to diversity and inclusion. Great place to work if you want to just work with a bunch of petty white nerds.\n- Did I mention senior leadership and management? Just the worst. I wish I could give negative stars just for this review.",

In 2025, we’ll continue leadership and management training to managers and leaders. \n\nThis has been a challenging year for many tech companies, and while we’ve made positive strides, we were not exempt from challenges. As we know, continued growth fuels opportunities. \n\nWe value open communication and feedback. As mentioned in other responses, we’ve just completed our Employee Engagement Survey to gather insights and feedback from the team.

Lots of third-hand feedback delivered through your boss because people are too cowardly to say what's on their mind. \n-Clueless, unaccountable leadership: Company touts that they didn't lay anyone off during the pandemic, then lays off 5% of the company last year, then continues to tout that they didn't lay anyone off!\n-Backstabbing Culture: No one is willing to deliver DIRECT feedback. Get used to having someone talk to your boss about you! It squashes any attempt at asking for help out of fear that someone will perceive it as weakness, resulting in termination. \n-High turnover: People disappear under \"suspicious circumstances\" (often at terrible times for client and project health). Executives are not exempt from this either. The company lost their COO and chief salesperson recently, then worked to spin their departure as a coincidence instead of a reflection of the company. Womp womp. \n-Inconsistent and contradictory goal requirements: There is no incentive to do strategic work that could make the company better when all of the company's goals and OKRs are about sales and billable time. Templates for docs like SOWs and legal-approved contracts desperately need overhauling, but no one has time or bandwidth to work on those tasks over client work. \n-Awful clients: Adswerve lives off its relationships with companies like Google and Adobe, so they often get the dregs that can't or won't pay for a real consulting firm. \n-Sneaky HR Practices: I've never heard of a company treating cost-of-living increases as \"merit\" increases. This is insulting, especially during a time of record inflation.",

Get used to having someone talk to your boss about you!

Womp womp. \n-Inconsistent and contradictory goal requirements: There is no incentive to do strategic work that could make the company better when all of the company's goals and OKRs are about sales and billable time. Templates for docs like SOWs and legal-approved contracts desperately need overhauling, but no one has time or bandwidth to work on those tasks over client work. \n-Awful clients: Adswerve lives off its relationships with companies like Google and Adobe, so they often get the dregs that can't or won't pay for a real consulting firm. \n-Sneaky HR Practices: I've never heard of a company treating cost-of-living increases as \"merit\" increases.

It’s like whatever you tell them goes in one ear out the other, they don’t care what you have to say unless you’re praising them. And HR will back them at every turn, so no use bringing it up to them.\n- Pay is lacking. They will change your entire job and title and expect more work out of you but no compensation for it. This will also throw off any career planning you had, so say goodbye to any chance at that promotion that seemed in reach. You aren’t gonna see it!\n- Our top leadership is insufferable. To lay people off weeks before Christmas, drop our yearly performance raises, just to turn around two months into the new year with the great news that we acquired another company….. has anyone looked up the definition of “tone deaf” in their life? To be told that I should be “lucky” to be receiving a 1% raise??? Action after action from this group of people has been a slap in the face to everyone working for Adswerve and showing up for it day after day and giving it their all.",

Management takes every opportunity to stiff people out of bonuses or extra pay for hard work.\n- Middle-to-upper management is also pretty terrible, among the worst I've worked for. I've never worked anywhere that had this many people in positions of power working against their employees.\n- Next to no opportunities for growth aside from company-mandated certifications. Want to take a course to prepare for those certifications? Too bad.\n- VERY political and VERY petty. Make one mistake and you'll be sure to hear about it from your manager who heard about it from someone else's manager.\n- Mediocre pay relative to the amount of work they demand. Adswerve has some real leaders in their fields at the company, but doesn't pay like it.\n- Ridiculous bonus structure. 1% pay raise for stellar performance during record inflation? Cool, thanks.\n- Lip service to diversity and inclusion. Great place to work if you want to just work with a bunch of petty white nerds.\n- Did I mention senior leadership and management? Just the worst. I wish I could give negative stars just for this review.",

      "# [A New Approach to Attribution: How Marketers Can Adapt by Jake Woodburn on 2024-03-26](https://adswerve.com/blog/a-new-approach-to-attribution-how-marketers-can-adapt)\nIn the ever-evolving digital marketing landscape, staying ahead of the curve is not just an option—it's a necessity. As we sail into the future, the Google Marketing Platform is preparing for a seismic shift in its attribution strategies, setting the stage for a new era in online advertising. Today, we delve into the intricacies of Google's Attribution Odyssey and the impending changes, particularly those involving cookies.\n\nThe Current Attribution Landscape\n\nThe Google Marketing Platform has long been a beacon for marketers seeking accurate and insightful attribution data. The platform's current model relies heavily on cookies, those tiny bits of data that follow users as they traverse the vast landscape of the internet. Cookies have been the unsung heroes, silently collecting information about user interactions and helping marketers understand the customer journey.\n\nHowever, the attribution playbook is about to undergo a rewrite.\n\nThe Cookie Chronicles\n\nEnter the era of change. As privacy concerns gain prominence and regulatory landscapes shift, cookies face increased scrutiny. Google is poised to respond with a series of platform changes designed to prioritize user privacy without sacrificing the quality of attribution data.\n\nThe Sunset of Third-Party Cookies\n\nGoogle has announced plans to phase out third-party cookies on its Chrome browser in 2024. This move aims to bolster user privacy by limiting cross-site tracking, but it also prompts marketers to rethink their attribution strategies.\n\nFirst-Party Data Renaissance\n\nWith third-party cookies on the way out, first-party data becomes more valuable than ever. Google Marketing Platform encourages marketers to cultivate and leverage their first-party data to maintain a robust understanding of user behavior.\n\nAI and Machine Learning Integration\n\nEmbracing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning, Google is enhancing its attribution models. These technologies will play a pivotal role in filling the void left by traditional tracking methods, providing more accurate insights into customer touchpoints.\n\nHow Will Marketers Leverage Tools to Help Them?\n\nThe Privacy Sandbox\n\nMost marketers don’t — and won’t — have access to the Privacy Sandbox. However, they can leverage learnings from it. As the Privacy Sandbox develops more advanced use cases, marketers will gain the ability to replicate some of the current use cases that rely on third-party cookies or other tracking mechanisms. This evolution will enable marketers to continue to leverage sophisticated targeting, attribution and measurement techniques while ensuring greater privacy protection for users. By embracing the Privacy Sandbox outcomes and its innovative solutions, marketers can adapt to the changing digital landscape and maintain effective advertising strategies that respect user privacy preferences.\n\nFor those looking for additional guidance or wanting to explore the Privacy Sandbox, don’t be afraid to seek out additional help. Knowledgeable partners like Adswerve have access to the Privacy Sandbox and can help explore potential solutions tailored to our customers' journey through the evolving digital landscape. A single conversation might be the starting point for clarity and direction. Please reach out if you’re interested in how this could benefit your strategy.\n\nGoogle Attribution Reporting API\n\nThe Google Attribution Reporting API is a programming interface that allows developers to access and retrieve attribution data from Google Ads and other Google marketing products. This API enables users to programmatically access and integrate attribution data, such as conversion metrics and attribution models, into their reporting tools or systems. With the Attribution Reporting API, developers can automate the retrieval of attribution data, allowing for more efficient analysis and reporting of marketing campaign performance across different channels and touchpoints.\n\nMulti-Touch Attribution Models and Marketing Mix Modeling\n\nMulti-touch attribution (MTA) models, especially Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM), will be crucial in navigating digital media attribution's future. MMM is a statistical analysis technique that helps marketers understand the impact of various marketing channels and tactics on overall performance and outcomes, such as sales or conversions.\n\nClients have successfully employed the power of MMM/MTA for a multitude of use cases to understand their digital media performance across various channels. Some real-life examples throughout the last year include guidance for optimizations, bidding and budgeting based on a customer acquisition cost (CAC). Using CAC from multiple data sources, advertisers can gain a more holistic view of their customer acquisition efforts and identify opportunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Use cases may vary by each client’s needs, whether a long-term analysis as the source of truth or a short-term test against other measurement tools.\n\nClient examples utilizing MMM/MTA over the past year have varied — from heavy reliance on the modeled data to dictate monthly budgets based on the impact of ROI from each media channel to head-to-head A/B testing measuring cohort analysis to further understand audience control.\n\nServer Side Tagging in Google Tag Manager\n\nServer-side cookies are cookies set, managed and accessed by a server rather than a user's browser. They are often used with client-side cookies to enhance security, improve performance and manage user sessions more effectively. In the context of first-party data, server-side cookies can be crucial in helping websites and applications collect and manage user data. Advanced use cases of this setup could ultimately help the durability of 1st-party cookies.\n\nPreparing for the Transition\n\nAdapting to the forthcoming changes in the Google Marketing Platform's attribution landscape requires a proactive approach:\n\nEducate Your Team\n\nEnsure that your marketing team is well-versed in the upcoming changes. Understanding the evolving attribution models will empower them to make informed decisions.\n\nAudit Your Data Sources\n\nTake stock of your existing data sources and evaluate their compliance with the changing privacy standards. Diversify your data collection methods and prioritize first-party data.\n\nExplore New Attribution Models\n\nThe Google Marketing Platform is likely to introduce alternative attribution models. Experiment with different approaches to discover what aligns best with your campaign goals and audience.\n\nThe Journey to Come\n\nThe attribution journey is on the brink of a revolution, and Google Marketing Platform is at the helm. By embracing these changes and adapting your strategies accordingly, you can confidently navigate the evolving landscape. As we bid farewell to third-party cookies and usher in a new era of attribution, the key lies in staying agile, informed and ready for the marketing adventures ahead.",
      "# [Third-Party Cookie Delay: A Reprieve, Not a Respite for Marketers on 2024-04-25](https://adswerve.com/blog/third-party-cookie-delay-a-reprieve-not-a-respite-for-marketers)\nGoogle has pushed back the end of third-party cookies (3PC) in Chrome yet again, with a new target of early 2025. This news offers a sigh of relief for some, but it's crucial to remember this is a delay and not a cancellation. Let's unpack what this means for the industry, and how you can make the most of this reprieve using the additional resources provided below.\n\nA Shifting Timeline\n\nRemember when 2020 was supposed to be the year of the 3PC apocalypse? The industry spoke, and Google listened. Here's the revised timeline:\n\nJanuary 2020: Google initially announced plans to phase out 3PC within two years.\n\nFebruary 2022: The first delay hit, with the sunset pushed to late 2023.\n\nJanuary 2024: The timeline shifted again, targeting a mid-2024 deprecation.\n\nApril 2024: Google’s most recent update places the official end date in early 2025.\n\nWhy the Delay?\n\nTwo key factors contributed to Google's decision:\n\nIndustry Concerns: Marketers and developers expressed a need for more time to adapt and explore alternatives. Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative, designed to replace 3PC tracking, needed further refinement.\n\nRegulatory Scrutiny: Antitrust investigations, particularly from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), prompted Google to address competition concerns before completely phasing out 3PC.\n\nWhat This Means for the Privacy Sandbox Initiatives\n\nWhile the phase-out of third-party cookies (3PC) has been pushed back to early 2025, most initiatives within the Privacy Sandbox, including the Topics API, Protected Audience API and Attribution Reporting API, are still on track for a Q3 2024 rollout.\n\nTesting Time Extended: The delay offers valuable extra time for developers and testers to refine Privacy Sandbox solutions within Chrome. This translates to potentially smoother functionality and a more seamless transition for advertisers when 3PC finally sunsets. Solutions in development include:\n\nEnhanced Cohort Targeting: Refining how advertisers target audience segments based on similar interests or browsing behaviors without relying on individual user identifiers.\n\nImproved Contextual Targeting: Testing methods for analyzing the context of webpages and content to deliver relevant ads without user tracking.\n\nPrivacy-Preserving Attribution: Developing solutions that accurately measure campaign effectiveness while upholding user privacy standards.\n\nIntegration Focus: Expect continued development on integrating these Sandbox solutions with Google Marketing Platform (GMP) products like Display & Video 360 (DV360) and Campaign Manager 360 (CM360). This will ensure a streamlined workflow for managing campaigns after 3PC deprecation.\n\nAddressing Industry Feedback: Google can use the additional time to incorporate valuable industry feedback. This could lead to increased transparency around how the Sandbox works, more open collaboration with stakeholders and potential adjustments to features based on advertiser needs.\n\nBonus time for website owners:\n\nThe delay also offers an advantage for website owners. Here are two proposals where you can take action:\n\nRelated Website Sets (RWS): Do you have a company with websites on multiple domains (e.g., brandx.com and fly-brandx.com) or domains for different countries (such as example.com, example.rs, example.uk, etc.)? RWS lets these sites share cookies. With the delay, you have more time to submit your domains for approval within RWS. Pro Tip: Make sure your domains meet the RWS guidelines before Q3 2024.\n\nCHIPS (SameSite=Lax for Cookies with Partitioned Storage): Do you use embedded services like chat widgets? CHIPS allows these services to use cookies with your main website. The extra time allows you to test and implement CHIPS if it works for your website.\n\n“While 2025 is now the official 3PC end date, acting now is the smart move. At Adswerve, we’re constantly testing solutions that will work best for advertisers and website owners while prioritizing user privacy. We’re also aggressively exploring Privacy Sandbox initiatives and finding ways to best utilize those solutions for our clients. The time for complacency is over; let’s get to work.”\n\n- Luka Cempre, Senior Data Scientist\n\nWhat This Means for Marketers\n\nMore Time to Adapt: This delay offers a valuable window to test and refine cookieless marketing strategies. Focus on collecting first-party (1P) data directly from your users. Integrate this with data from your own systems (like your CMS) to create a powerful, unified customer picture. Leverage user modeling and contextual targeting to deliver relevant experiences, and explore alternative identifiers to enhance your reach.\n\nUrgency Still Exists: While the deadline shifts, the cookieless future is inevitable. Don't get complacent. Prioritize building a sustainable, privacy-first marketing approach.\n\n“The viability of 3PC has been degrading for years. The playbook for how to respond is the same today as it was before this delay. Marketers should continue moving ahead with their plans as if 3rd party cookies are already gone.”\n\n- Jake Winter, Principal Lead\n\nWhat This Means for Agencies\n\nUpskilling Opportunity: Invest in training your team on cookieless solutions, data privacy regulations and alternative targeting methods.\n\nClient Education Is Key: Guide your clients through the upcoming changes and their impact on campaigns.\n\nNew Revenue Streams Emerge: Expertise in 1P data and privacy-compliant measurement can be a valuable asset for agencies.\n\n“Time is a finite thing, and I implore our agency partners to look at the extra time as an opportunity to focus on actioning the long-term plans that pertain to cookie deprecation rather than short-term fixes. Agencies should continue working with their clients to test and learn durable cookieless solutions, so they have more concrete and proven strategies in place when the deadline comes. Keep pushing forward; 2025 will be here faster than we think.”- Kelly Hayes, Director of Account Management, Agency\n\nWhat This Means for The Google Marketing Platform (GMP)\n\nFocus on Privacy Sandbox: Expect to see continued development and testing of Privacy Sandbox integrations within DV360, CM360 and other platforms. These solutions will leverage technologies like Conversion Domains and Floodlight Conversion Categories to help you reach your target audiences effectively while respecting user privacy.\n\n1P Data Takes Center Stage: Look for further development of tools within GMP to streamline 1P data collection and campaign integration. Focus on collaborating with internal teams to gather as much 1P data as possible and leverage GMP for seamless data utilization.\n\nGA4 Remains Central: Expect ongoing development of GA4's functionalities for collecting and analyzing privacy-compliant data. Use the extended timeframe to test and refine existing workflows and explore new possibilities within GA4, including:\n\nSetting up GA4 for media measurement.\n\nEstablishing audience segmentation strategies.\n\nConfiguring BigQuery data exports.\n\nImplementing event-based bidding tactics.\n\n“The net result is unaffected. We were just given a little gift of being able to connect and align more between upcoming Summer PTOs and hectic calendars. We have the opportunity to feel a little less anxious, but media and analytics teams shouldn’t cancel 3PCD-related items like team meetings, roadmap developments or strategy change approvals. Instead, use the given time to double down and really think about what GMP strategies will be the best suited for your goals and needs, rather than rushing to accomplish a baseline ‘good enough’ because there wasn’t enough time.\"\n\n- Mary Kotara, Lead Consultant, Media\n\n“Cookies will live on into 2025, but focusing on your 3PCD readiness shouldn’t change. Taking actionable steps within the respective GMP platforms, dialing in your 1P data strategy and shaping your overall mindset to make sure you’re prepared should remain top priorities.”\n\n- Jeff Collins, Associate Director, Media Activation\n\nA Final Note\n\nWhile Google extends the timeline for phasing out 3PC, it's important to remember that other browsers like Safari and Firefox have already blocked 3PC. Use this delay to your advantage — experiment, build a strong data foundation and emerge from this shift stronger than ever.\n\nDon't wait until the very last minute — the future is now, and it's privacy-focused.\n\n\"This delay gives the industry a brief reprieve, but it doesn’t mean you should slow down or sideline any efforts you have in development. Anything done now to build a 1P data strategy is only going to get you further ahead of the curve!\"\n\n- Lars von Sneidern, Sr. Director of Analytics / Services Product Manager\n\nNeed help developing and executing your strategy for 3PC deprecation?

      "# [Results | Six Flags | Adswerve by Adswerve Inc](https://adswerve.com/results/six-flags)\nEntertainment giant Six Flags operates theme parks and attractions throughout North America. Their marketing team relies heavily on data from its web, app and sales platforms to monitor sales and marketing metrics and make informed decisions about park operations and guest experiences.\n\nSix Flags partnered with Google Cloud and Adswerve for a marketing analytics workshop to help identify untapped opportunities in their data. Through that process, the teams pinpointed an initiative to explore expanding Six Flags’ existing social sentiment initiative.\n\nTheir legacy sentiment tool was limited to providing a high-level brand score and couldn’t connect to Reddit, which was a big ask from senior leadership. Both the marketing team and the C-suite wanted the ability to go deeper to create and monitor scores by park location and key categories so they could better understand what products and experiences visitors enjoy — and uncover friction points they need to act on.\n\nUltimately, the Six Flags marketing team wanted to understand their guests’ perceptions of the brand, parks and customer experience to see what works and what doesn’t — and easily share the findings with the C-suite for visibility, investigation and quick action.\n\nAdswerve got to work, diving into Six Flags' robust social sentiment solution needs. The team uncovered that Six Flags wanted to monitor sentiment in five core categories: entertainment, food & beverage, price, cleanliness, wait times and customer experience for each of its 27 parks across five social platforms: Google Reviews, Trip Advisor, Instagram, Facebook and Reddit. Because Six Flags operates parks in Canada and Mexico, they also needed the ability to translate French and Spanish social posts into English.\n\nAfter thoroughly investigating Six Flags' solution requirements, we began building a new, more robust social sentiment tool. We used Amplify to connect the five social sources in Google Cloud Platform’s data warehouse, BigQuery, reducing the need for custom API development and shortening implementation time.\n\nOnce we connected the data, our data engineers leveraged the full power of Google Cloud to automate data pulls, transform data (including translating other languages into English), assign sentiment scores and categories, create trend summaries using generative AI and push the synthesized information to Looker in real time. It all happens from one platform with one SQL query.\n\nSix Flags can now view and share a Looker dashboard that includes overall and park-specific sentiment scores and uses generative AI to surface the top five positive and negative trends in a \"week in review\" summary. They can easily see performance and insights — and the social comments driving them — and monitor them over time.\n\nThe power of this data was realized shortly into the project while the dashboard was still in development. A park approached marketing to update its highly trafficked park homepage, theorizing visitors were unhappy with recent maintenance impacting ride availability. Six Flags marketing was able to quickly validate the topic was trending for the park in the initial data sets and move forward confidently with the site update to better set expectations for visitors. And while seasonality and completed maintenance both play a part, the park has seen fewer negative posts and its customer experience sentiment score climb month-over-month since implementing the change.\n\nToday, Six Flags can easily view and understand overall customer sentiment and drill in by park across the five main performance categories in their Looker dashboard to uncover additional opportunities to improve the customer experience. If sentiment drops in a particular park in a specific category over time, they can explore the reasons and quickly remedy them. Similarly, they can identify why sudden dips or spikes are happening and quantify how critical an issue is by how many people are discussing it. The Six Flags marketing team can also see the immediate impact price changes, new or updated rides, events, seasonality and more have on sentiment in the short and long term, and make appropriate changes to their digital marketing programs, park operations and more.\n\nBeyond providing powerful insights, the new solution saves Six Flags time. What used to be a manual process, taking 15 people two to three hours per week each, is now fully automated, incorporates the latest AI technology and is easily shareable with organization stakeholders.\n\nUp next? Six Flags is entering their busy events season and plans to use the new social sentiment tool to see how national events stack up against park-specific ones. They’ll incorporate their learning into their future events strategy. The team also plans to add X (formerly Twitter) to their selected social platform sources.",

      "# [How Cedars-Sinai and Adswerve Built a Privacy-First, Omnichannel Analytics Strategy with Adobe CJA on 2024-08-13](https://adswerve.com/blog/how-cedars-sinai-and-adswerve-built-a-privacy-first-omnichannel-analytics-strategy-with-adobe-cja)\nLeading healthcare organization Cedars-Sinai strives to be at the forefront of care and deliver an exceptional patient experience. This extends to its digital experience and the Cedars Consumer Digital Innovation (CDI) team’s efforts to advance and innovate its analytics and personalization strategy — a daunting challenge in healthcare due to complex patient privacy requirements.\n\nTo gain deeper insights into patient interactions across various channels, Cedars-Sinai’s CDI team sought a modern analytics platform that extends beyond basic product and funnel analytics. They needed a solution that could map consumer and patient journeys across channels and identify specific user segments requiring actionable engagement. Viewing this as a strategic opportunity, the CDI team aimed to find a long-term solution that not only adheres to Cedars-Sinai’s stringent patient privacy requirements but also advances the organization’s goal of delivering large-scale, compliant, omnichannel personalization for patients and users.\n\nTo develop this modern analytics infrastructure based on consistent tracking and accurate, HIPAA-compliant data collection across the patient journey, the CDI team selected Adobe’s Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) to replace Adobe Analytics.\n\nWith the platform selected, Cedars-Sinai needed a partner to help implement CJA properly and create consistency across several disparate web properties and mobile applications (website domains, email, MyChart and virtual care, and offline touchpoints, like call centers) and lay the foundation for its long-term omnichannel personalization strategy.\n\nBuilding a Long-Term Solution\n\nConsulting with Adobe led the CDI team to connect with potential implementation partners. The team ultimately selected Adswerve to advise on and implement CJA because of the consultancy’s expertise and experience. From the initial conversation to the seamless discovery and scoping process, it was clear that Adswerve could help the CDI team not only implement CJA but also collaborate on the strategic foundation it needed for its long-term plans. Once Adswerve was on board, the teams collaborated to develop and execute a multi-phase implementation plan.\n\nIn phase one, Adswerve served as both a technical and strategic partner to the CDI team. Adswerve completed the initial CJA implementation to connect Cedars-Sinai’s primary domain, five sub-domains and iOS and Android apps, and deliver new insights into the patient journey across their web and app assets.\n\nAdswerve also collaborated to set the foundations for a new data governance strategy at Cedars-Sinai, helping them evolve from disparate systems and tracking approaches to a more holistic strategy. The strategic framework and new tracking documentation were key to implementing CJA to be scalable, consistent and HIPAA-compliant across the organization’s tools and teams for years to come.

      "# [Maximizing DV360's Optimized Targeting: Operational Insights and Pitfalls by Scott Kelly on 2024-01-30](https://adswerve.com/blog/mastering-dv360-optimized-targeting-best-practices-and-tips)\nIf you are an avid Display and Video 360 (DV360) user, you have likely heard of, seen or used a new feature in DV360 called “optimized targeting.” This feature is an evolution of Google's audience expansion solution, and Adswerve is here to guide you through how to use this new feature effectively.\n\nWhat is Optimized Targeting?\n\nOptimized targeting is DV360’s latest lookalike iteration that leverages Google’s machine learning. It utilizes a wide range of signals, which are also employed in Google's automated bidding process. This innovative approach helps identify incremental reach with audiences that are more likely to take the desired KPI action.\n\nWith the release of this feature, you have the opportunity to optimize your programmatic campaign’s performance by expanding your audience while optimizing toward custom performance goals without the availability of third-party cookies. (The deprecation of third-party cookies is on the horizon for 2H 2024).\n\nOptimized targeting is a powerful tool that can help reach audiences beyond your current first-party targeted segments while always working to achieve your campaign’s goals. As with any automated AI tool, it’s best to have a well-thought-out approach before you enable optimized targeting in DV360.\n\nWhether or not you’ve tested optimized targeting, below are some helpful tips and considerations to keep in mind when using the feature.\n\nBest Practices for Optimized Targeting:\n\nEnsure that you have all your necessary targeting applied to your line Items before you enable optimized targeting.\n\nReview the current setup of your line item prior to enabling optimized targeting to help avoid overspending:\n\nBe mindful of your line item’s available impressions to ensure you do not have too large of a reach.\n\nKeep in mind the size of your intended first-party audience list/s.\n\nPRO TIP: Use the “reach widget” to the right of your line Item settings to view its total reach potential prior to turning on optimized targeting. (Note: the reach widget will not take into account or reflect any increase in available impressions that optimized targeting may generate).\n\nPRO TIP: Review your audience size under the “All Audiences” tab in the advertiser view.\n\nOptimized targeting functions similarly to how automated bidding models work. Allow up to two weeks for the algorithm to learn and calibrate, as spend/performance may fluctuate when you initially turn on the feature.\n\nOptimized targeting should not exceed spend or Target CPA (tCPA) goals, although it may, in some instances due to setup. Carefully observe these line Items as the system continues to learn by pulling campaign performance reports throughout your campaign fight.\n\nGenerate a report in DV360 using the optimized targeting dimension to measure which impressions come from optimized targeting and which come from your selected segments.\n\nYes: Impressions that come from optimized targeting.\n\nNo: Impressions that come from your selected segments.\n\nNot Recommended for Optimized Targeting:\n\nImpression-based budgets: there are system limitations when using impression-based budgets and optimized targeting together. Often, a line Item will overspend in DV360 when these two are combined, even with tight targeting and a relatively smaller reach.\n\nNote: Google does not offer any credits for impression-based budgets.\n\nBroad targeting with a high available impression reach.\n\nDMA targeting: this geo-targeting approach combined with optimized targeting may result in inventory targeted outside of the set DMA targeting.\n\nLimitations:\n\nOptimized targeting is not currently available for Connected TV (CTV) line Items.\n\nYou can still widen your reach for Connected TV (CTV) in DV360 with audience expansion.\n\nOptimized targeting is currently available for YouTube Action line Items only. This feature is currently not available for all other YouTube line Item types. You can still use Audience Expansion for these YouTube Line Items.\n\nTargeting a first-party audience list positively and negatively at the same time.\n\nBe Aware of System Default:\n\nOptimized targeting will be automatically enabled for new display, video, and audio line items using automated bid strategies when targeting the following audiences:\n\nGoogle Affinity audiences\n\nGoogle In-market audiences\n\nGoogle Custom audiences\n\nNote: If you have new line items where optimized targeting is automatically turned on, and you do not want this feature enabled, then you must manually disable OT in line item settings.\n\nWhere Can I Find More Information?\n\nAdswerve Blog: Out With Similar Audiences and Targeting Expansion, In With Optimized Targeting\n\nGoogle Marketing Platform PDF: Optimized Targeting - Introducing Google’s latest AI-powered technology\n\nDV360 Help Center: Optimized Targeting for DV360\n\nDV360 Help Center: Optimized Targeting - FAQs",

      "# [Four Key Questions to Sharpen Your Q4 Programmatic Strategy by Megan Folkmann on 2024-10-24](https://adswerve.com/blog/four-key-questions-to-sharpen-your-q4-programmatic-strategy)\nHave the “Q4 scaries” started yet? Media buyers anticipating the competitive surge of CPMs and limited inventory find that this time of year never seems to get any easier. Especially as they’re met with waves of heavy election spending, routine holiday demand, and heightened competition for premium placements (looking at you, connected TV).\n\nYou’re likely prioritizing share of voice for the final stretch of the year to maximize your return on ad spend (ROAS), leads or other KPIs while being mindful of using your media dollars.\n\nGoogle’s Display & Video 360 (DV360) can help with its transparent cost structure, media format consolidation and exclusive inventory available within one interface. With DV30, you have the freedom to bring any Q4 media plan to life. So as you strategize for 2025, here are four questions to consider while honing your campaign checklist for Q4 and beyond:\n\n1. Who’s included in your first-party data, and how is it compiled?\n\nFirst-party data (1PD) will always be the cherry on top of every media plan. It’s cost-effective, relevant to your brand and can be utilized for precise audience targeting or suppression. You can collect 1PD through a variety of methods like web analytics, cookies, mobile apps, customer relationship management (CRM) systems and more. Having a mix of data sources can mean a higher likelihood of capturing new prospects and retaining loyal customers while protecting your users’ privacy.\n\nWant to extend the reach of your 1PD Consider tapping into Google’s Publisher Advertiser Identity Reconciliation (PAIR), which matches the data through encryption without relying on third-party (3P) cookies.\n\nAnd make sure to explore LiveRamp. Its direct integration with DV360 makes it a preferred clean-room provider for uploading and managing data. Reach out to your Adswerve account manager to learn more about LiveRamp and its additional capabilities.\n\n2. Are your media fees updated and accurate?\n\nMedia cost calculations can vary dramatically depending on inventory, targeting and the ad-serving fees required to set a campaign into action. Before setting your campaign live, you need to assign and QA all fees required to ensure there aren’t any surprise costs added to the total that could be deducted from your reported ROI. DV360’s cost settings allow you to capture all fees equated to a gross budget, such as revenue markup for agencies, third-party integration fees, platform fees, service fees and CPM fees.\n\nBe sure to check that these are accurately applied and at the correct rate, as they can adjust based on the total impressions served (special reduction rates may apply for the volume of impressions served) or the negotiation type (direct buys vs. RTB). Setting fees at a rate higher than necessary can eat into your net media costs, while setting them at a lower rate can incur unaccounted costs and lead to campaign overspending.\n\n3. What type of brand-safe content should you include or avoid?\n\nThe 2024 political season offers two options: leaning into the ever-evolving news content or excluding it altogether. Even within the last year, advertisers have shifted to more contextual strategies in anticipation of 3P cookie deprecation and privacy consent changes, along with quick pivots after reading the eye-opening articles highlighting MFA sites that are far from desired premium content.\n\nTaking it a step further, you can manage content you consider unsuitable for your brand primarily through blocklists, category and keyword targeting, or using a third-party partner for a more customizable approach to managing ad–fraud and content avoidance. DV360 offers free brand safety content labels and sensitive category exclusions, including an easily accessible pre-bid integration with Adloox, IAS and DoubleVerify.\n\n4. Does your plan support a full-funnel approach?\n\nDV360 is ideal for reaching and engaging audiences throughout the entire customer journey, from brand awareness to final conversion. With its robust suite of targeting, creative optimization and reporting tools across display, video, audio and connected TV, DV360 covers a wide approach.\n\nYou can build unified, data-driven strategies by aligning top-of-funnel awareness efforts with mid-funnel consideration and bottom-funnel conversion campaigns, And you’ll be able to tailor messaging to your user's intent at each stage, driving stronger performance, higher engagement and more conversions."
