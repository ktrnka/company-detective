      "# [7 Surprising Facts You Need to Know About Guinea’s Currency by Growth Machine on 2024-07-22](https://blog.remitly.com/currencies/guinea-currency/)\nThe Guinean franc (GNF) is the official currency of the Republic of Guinea, a country in West Africa in the Guinea geographical region. Occasionally, it goes by the hyphenated name “Guinea-Conakry” to differentiate it from other nearby countries.\n\nAlthough many of Guinea’s neighbors use the West African CFA franc, Guinea has had its own currency since 1959. Before sending money to friends or family in Guinea, let’s brush up on the history of the Guinea franc, including its banknotes and coinage.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Guinea currency, and how to look up the real-time exchange rate using a currency converter.\n\nGuinea currency basics\n\nThe Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea is responsible for issuing the Guinea franc, with seven banknote denominations commonly seen in circulation:\n\n100 francs\n\n500 francs\n\n1,000 francs\n\n2,000 francs\n\n5,000 francs\n\n10,000 francs\n\n20,000 francs\n\nThere are also 25 franc and 50 franc banknotes, but these are less common due to their low value. As for coins, you’ll find 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 franc denominations.\n\nThe design of the Guinea franc changes with every issue, and there have been several commemorative editions to mark occasions like the 50th anniversary of the Guinea franc.\n\nThey all feature the Guinean coat of arms, as well as culturally significant images such as a banana harvest, Mount Nimba, the Kaleta hydroelectric dam, or a bauxite mine.\n\nIf you’re looking to exchange the Guinea franc for a foreign currency, you can use the currency code GNF to look it up on foreign exchange markets.\n\nWithin the country, you may see the abbreviations FG‎, Fr, or GFr to denote Guinean money.\n\nHistory of Guinea’s currency\n\nThe country that’s now Guinea has a shared history with other West African countries, with the Ghana, Mali, and Songhai empires all exerting their influence on the region from as early as the 3rd century.\n\nGold played a major role from the start, both for decorative purposes and as currency in the form of gold dust, wire, and nuggets.\n\nPortuguese traders established ports in the 15th century, and France claimed the territory as part of the French Empire in the late 1800s. The French military called the colony Rivières du Sud, meaning “southern rivers,” before changing the name to French Guinea.\n\nFrance introduced the CFA franc in 1945 to provide a common currency throughout its West and Central African territories, including Guinea. You’ll find other versions of this currency in countries like Senegal and Cameroon.\n\nAfter gaining its independence in 1958, the Republic of Guinea developed its own legal tender, and the first Guinea franc arrived on the scene in 1959.\n\n7 surprising facts about Guinean currency\n\nDue to its geographical location and natural resources, the Republic of Guinea has had a major role in the economy of the region—and an effect on other currencies of the world.\n\nHere are seven surprising facts about Guinea’s currency that you may not know:\n\n1. ‘Guinea’ is also the name of an old English coin.\n\nIf you hear someone mention a “Guinea coin” in a historical context, chances are they aren’t talking about the Guinea franc. The guinea is the name of a gold coin that was first minted in 1663 and used throughout the British Empire until 1814.\n\nSo, why was it called the guinea? They made the coin with gold from the Guinea region, and then it became the name of the coin itself.\n\nAt one point, a guinea was worth 21 shillings or 1.05 pounds. The guinea is no longer legal tender in the United Kingdom, but it was valid until Decimal Day in 1971, when decimalisation changed the way money was represented in the U.K. system.\n\n2. The Republic of Guinea previously used the CFA franc.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1958, Guinea used the French colonial currency, the CFA franc. After the end of the colonial period, the CFA franc evolved into two different currencies: the West African CFA franc and the Central African CFA franc.\n\nThese two currencies have the same value and are interchangeable in all 14 countries that use them. Since they’re pegged to the euro (EUR), they don’t float freely on global currency markets and have a fixed value of €1 to 655.957 CFA francs.\n\nThe Republic of Guinea, however, never joined the currency union that uses the CFA franc. It issues its own currency with its own free-floating exchange rate.\n\n3. There are no centimes in circulation.\n\nLike the CFA francs, one Guinea franc consists of 100 centimes—but you won’t find centimes anywhere in Guinea.\n\nThat’s because the value of the centime is so low that the Central Bank has never issued any denomination smaller than 1 GNF.\n\n4. Guinea briefly switched to the syli in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1971, the country introduced the syli, a currency made up of 100 cauris. Although the Central Bank issued syli coins and banknotes, at 10 francs to 1 syli, they didn’t last long: In 1985, Guinea switched back to the franc, with 1 franc equal to 1 syli.\n\n5. Guinea banknotes use the French language.\n\nIf you look at a Guinea banknote, you’ll notice that most of the writing is in French. For example, 20,000 francs is written as “vingt mille francs guinéens.”\n\nThis is because Guinea was a French territory until 1958. In fact, the official language of the Republic of Guinea is still French.\n\n6. A British printing house designed the early Guinean franc.\n\nDespite getting its name from French currency, several early print runs of the Guinean franc happened in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe iconic De La Rue printing house, which is the largest company of its kind in the world, designed an early set of banknotes.\n\nDe La Rue has worked with at least 140 countries and has designed over one-third of the world’s currency denominations.\n\n7. Guinean banknotes have numerous security features.\n\nIn addition to their beautiful designs, Guinean banknotes contain holographic patches, security strips, and other advanced features to prevent fraud.\n\nOver the years, these have included various watermarks, diamond-shaped patches, and the letters “RG” (Republic of Guinea) to denote their authenticity.\n\nUnderstanding Guinea franc exchange rates\n\nThe Guinea franc is a free-floating currency, which means its value fluctuates compared to other global currencies, such as the U.S. dollar (USD) or the Canadian dollar (CAD).\n\nIn recent years, Guinea’s economy has experienced high inflation—12.60% in 2021—but the country remains a major exporter of gold, bauxite, and other natural resources.\n\nIf you intend to travel to Guinea, you’ll likely want to take cash with you in your local currency and convert it to Guinea francs when you arrive, since ATMs have small withdrawal limits and credit card transactions are rare.\n\nYou can also use a money transfer service to send money to Guinea, with options for receiving funds via a bank deposit, mobile money, or cash pickup.\n\nSend money to Guinea from overseas\n\nWhen you need to send funds to loved ones in Guinea, Remitly makes it easy with a secure mobile app and transparent transaction fees.\n\nYou can send your transfer with a debit card or credit card and track it every step of the way.\n\nDownload the app, and we’ll show you how to get started today.\n\nFurther reading",

He only gave his first name , I asked about his last name, as I would assume that maybe there is more than one Joel working at Remitly! He said that he is not comfortable with giving his last name !! He even got sort of offended, But has the nerve to ask me to upload a photo of someone else’s ID!! \n\nMrs Joel seems to understand PI privacy very well when it comes to his own privacy but other people PI/he doesn’t care!!\n\nRemitly!! What is going on! Are you being hacked !!\n\nCan you please hire people with nice soft skills also!! That  mysterious person who has first name only called Joel is very rude person, talking to him almost turned into a fight, while all what I’m trying to is use your do business.\n\nIf it’s true that all of the sudden it’s mandatory to provide a copy of the receiver ID, then ask the  receiver  to do so when they receive the money. What usually happens at the time of receiving money. The receiver would show ID.\n\nBut keeping a copy of a government official ID is in violation of federal laws in this scenario!! Receiver only required to show ID when receiving money that matches the info on the transaction!\n\nCan someone look into this seriously and update me!\nI’m seriously concerned, this seems to be a fraud!\nI’m going to file a complain to FTC!\n\nI work in fintech!!

I see people stating that they will receive their refund within three months. I see that there is no way to reach someone that could help us through the company. That there is only customer service that are not fully trained to help us, except to say that somebody will call us. Nobody has called me. This is my first time using this. The computer says everything is great, but nothing is good. I have talked to the bank my girlfriend and I said money to has talked with the bank. It never went through, but it says it’s there. How could they lie about this? Why would they fraud and then when I asked for the money returned they’re gonna keep pushing forward. I have seen on your site numbers to call in case fraud or anything like this happens. We are protective by our government so I will make that call. I will send that letter about this company. Should not be allowed for them to do this return the money don’t play the game with your users. It is my money that you were playing with. That’s not fair. You are hurting so many people. I’m usually very careful, but I’m going back to MoneyGram. At least I know I can reach their customer service that can actually help me at that moment.\n\nSecond part: \nFind a way to complete transactions correctly. Not state it is complete when never fully completed into bank account . \n\nExplain better process of how you can help a first time deposit . \n\nContact bank and assist transaction . \n\nThis is no way to send money if not correct . \n\nWill go back to MONEYGRAM . \n\nOnly good you have is one representative stated to wait a few days for us to investigate. \n\nSecond representative seen the investigation and noticed no way to help so refund was completed within one minute . \n\nRemitly can hire good hearted people but as a company they are not ready to serve the demand that is needed to process transfers .",

And sent many transactions  to my family members .\nToday I tried to send to my nephew for the first time as a gift for his birthday.\nSo I get a call from Remitly, few mins right after I submitted my transaction, someone named Joel , he refused to tell me his last name !!!\n\nHe asked me to upload a photo of my nephew’s ID to complete the transactions.\n\nIt does not sound right that I have the right to upload a photo of someone else’s ID, which it has their personal info, such as birthdate, full address, full name, etc.\n\nWhy would “Joel” assume that I even have a photo of someone else’s ID, even if that person is a family member!!!\nwhy “Joel” thinks it’s right for someone to provide a photo of someone else’s ID!!\n\nMind you this is the first time this has happened.\n\nIt ironic!!!  when I asked “Joel” to identify himself. He only gave his first name , I asked about his last name, as I would assume that maybe there is more than one Joel working at Remitly! He said that he is not comfortable with giving his last name !! He even got sort of offended, But has the nerve to ask me to upload a photo of someone else’s ID!! \n\nMrs Joel seems to understand PI privacy very well when it comes to his own privacy but other people PI/he doesn’t care!!\n\nRemitly!! What is going on! Are you being hacked !!\n\nCan you please hire people with nice soft skills also!! That  mysterious person who has first name only called Joel is very rude person, talking to him almost turned into a fight, while all what I’m trying to is use your do business.\n\nIf it’s true that all of the sudden it’s mandatory to provide a copy of the receiver ID, then ask the  receiver  to do so when they receive the money. What usually happens at the time of receiving money. The receiver would show ID.\n\nBut keeping a copy of a government official ID is in violation of federal laws in this scenario!! Receiver only required to show ID when receiving money that matches the info on the transaction!\n\nCan someone look into this seriously and update me!\nI’m seriously concerned, this seems to be a fraud!\nI’m going to file a complain to FTC!\n\nI work in fintech!!

We had used a different cash transfer system, but the fees on our end and especially on his end, were so high that he was losing 20% of the money we would send him to fees. Remitly has been much better on both ends. We get lower fees and he gets much lower fees, so we will be using Remitly from now on.",

They literally took my money but did not deliver to my recipient Mobile money wallet within 10 minutes as promised during the time of transaction. As I am typing I have spent the last 2 days of my busy time with their customer service but yet there is no solution. My final course of action is to file a report with the Florida Office of Financial Regulation. This is unacceptable and should not be allowed to happen. Do not say I did not warn you.",

I see people stating that they will receive their refund within three months. I see that there is no way to reach someone that could help us through the company. That there is only customer service that are not fully trained to help us, except to say that somebody will call us. Nobody has called me. This is my first time using this. The computer says everything is great, but nothing is good. I have talked to the bank my girlfriend and I said money to has talked with the bank. It never went through, but it says it’s there. How could they lie about this? Why would they fraud and then when I asked for the money returned they’re gonna keep pushing forward. I have seen on your site numbers to call in case fraud or anything like this happens. We are protective by our government so I will make that call. I will send that letter about this company. Should not be allowed for them to do this return the money don’t play the game with your users. It is my money that you were playing with. That’s not fair. You are hurting so many people. I’m usually very careful, but I’m going back to MoneyGram. At least I know I can reach their customer service that can actually help me at that moment.\n\nSecond part: \nFind a way to complete transactions correctly. Not state it is complete when never fully completed into bank account . \n\nExplain better process of how you can help a first time deposit . \n\nContact bank and assist transaction . \n\nThis is no way to send money if not correct . \n\nWill go back to MONEYGRAM . \n\nOnly good you have is one representative stated to wait a few days for us to investigate. \n\nSecond representative seen the investigation and noticed no way to help so refund was completed within one minute . \n\nRemitly can hire good hearted people but as a company they are not ready to serve the demand that is needed to process transfers .",

In my case i had a fraudulent charge show up from them on my bank account.  They couldn't provide me any information on the charge.

Other people had sent this person money before with no problem.  I called Remitly to try to resolve this but it didn't help.

When I created an account, they did nothing to verify my identity other than confirm my email.  They did nothing to confirm the accuracy or ownership of my bank account used for the transfer.  So security doesn't seem to be their strength.\n\nI also set up a Wise account.  When I wanted to do a transfer, they verify my email, they send 2FA verification codes with every sign-in.  They require more frequent sign-in and more frequent verification codes.  They require a picture of my identification and a selfie of myself.  They verify my ownership of the bank account I use for withdrawals.  Much tighter security.

I also asked that they refund the late fees incurred because of them and they did(in the form of a credit). I immediately used the credit and vowed not to use their service again.\n\n\n\nEDIT: I submitted complaints via the BBB and CFBP shortly after my original post.\n\nToday 1/12/2023 the status of the transaction magically changed from \"completed\" to on hold.\n\nI called and Remitly couldn't tell me why the transaction was on hold or why they had initially marked it as completed to begin with.\n\nAfter reconfirming that all the information was correct their resolution was to change the \"banking partner\" on the transaction to a different banking partner. I asked who the previous one was and who the new one would be and the rep said he couldn't share that info. Mind you I have been asking about these \"banking partners\" since the beginning because something about the whole thing seems fishy but Remitly won't share who these partners are and what they do exactly.\n\nAnyways instead of doing that I asked to cancel the transaction so I can get a refund. As soon as the money is back in my account I'm resending using my bank's wire transfer and I'm closing the Remitly account for good. I don't need these headaches in my life.\n\nTLDR; I sent a transaction of more than $3,000. Remitly didn't deliver the money but are claiming that they did. Every time I call they tell me they'll escalate the case and conduct an investigation. It's been 2 weeks and they keep telling me the same thing.\n\n\n\nOn 12/28/2023 1 initiated a transfer of $3154.57 from my US account to my international\n\naccount.\n\nOn 1/03/2024 I received a notification that the transfer had been completed. As of 1/10/2024, the money has not been delivered to the account.\n\nI have called Remitly on 8 different occations and have been told different stories about what's going on, including:\n\n* The transaction is complete and I'm incorrect\n* My bank is closed(lt's not)\n* Remitly is conducting an investigation and I'll hear back in 24 hours(l haven't)\n\nI have provived Remitly with copies of my official bank statement that clearly show the money was never received. Depending on who picks up the phone or chat, the Remitly rep states either of the following:\n\n* They spoke with my bank and my bank told them the money was deposited into my\n\naccount\n\n* They are doing an investigation(again)\n\nI have checked with my bank multiple times and they have told m e they have not been contacted by Remitly, and they have no received any funds from them so Remitly is clearly lying and refusing to provide any useful information. I have asked Remitly repeatedly to provide me with the emails they claim to have received from my bank stating the funds were deposited but they can't/won't. I have also asked to speak with the \"internal department\" conducting the investigation but have been told that I can't speak with them and that they will contact me once the investigation is completed.\n\nLast week I was told the investigation would be completed and I would get a resolution today 1/10/2024. When I called today I was told all of the above again and now they are\n\nsupposedly conducting a new investigation...\n\nI just filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau but other than that I don't know what I can do here.

Basically, if your full name and/or other information doesn't closely match, that could be part of the issue. Not saying it is, but very commonly people move and don't promptly update their state id / driver's license, etc. One is supposed to even if they just move down the street. While states generally don't enforce such stuff, it causes problems with automated verification many services use.\n\nIf your full name matches up and not moved at all, then something else triggered the review. Even how you accessed the website, such as through a VPN.

I've already researched the bank address and SWIFT code of Maya Bank, but just wanted to confirm if tama.\n\n## Comment ID k8dx923 with +2 score by [(LetsbuildPh, Reddit, 2023-11-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalbanksPh/comments/17qqk1l/remitly_or_wise_to_maya_question/k8dx923/) (in reply to ID 17qqk1l):\nHave you seen this already OP?

      "# Post ID yussir: Is Remitly a scam? with +2 score by [(staydiligent, Reddit, 2022-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/yussir/is_remitly_a_scam/)\nI have never heard of Remitly before. Someone signed up using my email address. \n\nI received an email saying a transaction was canceled due to lack of providing further information. \n\nI looked into Remitly and they have a decent rating on trustpilot. \n\nI went to their website and started chatting with their customer service requesting that the account associated with my email be banned/deleted as its fraud. \n\nThey are asking me for too much personal information including my physical address.\n\nIs Remitly a legit company?\n\n## Comment ID iwbdf71 with +3 score by [(cyberiangringo, Reddit, 2022-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/yussir/is_remitly_a_scam/iwbdf71/) (in reply to ID yussir):\nI just registered with Remitly to  test the process.\n\nThe email account I used was sent a notification of this registration.  Thus at some point your email account likely was as well.  However, it did not seem like an email that was a verification, but rather a fait accompli notification.\n\nRather than give Remitly your personal info, since you control the email address for the account, have you considered resetting the password to something ridiculously crazy, such that the scammer could never get back into that account?  Once you did that, and you have control of the account, then maybe you could block any and all emails from remitly(.)com?  And with a crazy password, and no desire to ever use Remitly, you could simply not give a F that this account exists.\n\n## Comment ID iwbqjyj with +3 score by [(nimble2, Reddit, 2022-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/yussir/is_remitly_a_scam/iwbqjyj/) (in reply to ID yussir):\nRemitly is a legitimate money transfer platform.  It is mostly used for \"remittances\" which is to say that it is a way for people working in a foreign country to send money home to friends and relatives.\n\n## Comment ID iwb1p3d with +2 score by [(music_man1959, Reddit, 2022-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/yussir/is_remitly_a_scam/iwb1p3d/) (in reply to ID yussir):\nGuessing this - [https://www.remitly.com/](https://www.remitly.com/) will be what you are talking about.

      "# Post ID 1c21ae0: Is someone using my info to commit fraud (remitly)? - with phone number with +8 score by [(Hmhowboutno, Reddit, 2024-04-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/1c21ae0/is_someone_using_my_info_to_commit_fraud_remitly/)\nMany months ago I kept getting texts from Remitly that someone has transferred money to China and Vietnam. I thought these were fake scammer numbers until one day I had enough and made a Remitly account myself. I ended up getting a text from the same number, so I realized these were legitimate texts from Remitly. I called Remitly and they said I had two accounts - which I clearly did not authorize anyone to use my phone number. It could be someone mistakenly using my number but it seems suspicious, since my debit card and people in my family’s debit was hacked a while back. I don’t know how they were even able to add my phone number in the first place, without being able to read my texts, so I’m concerned they might have access to my texts. Should I be concerned? What steps should I take? Thank you.\n\n## Comment ID kzttqub with +3 score by [(HeySoulClassics, Reddit, 2024-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/1c21ae0/is_someone_using_my_info_to_commit_fraud_remitly/kzttqub/) (in reply to ID 1c21ae0):\nSorry, I don't have an answer for you. I'm commenting because over the last few days Remitly has started sending automated calls and texts asking me to verify information they need to complete a transfer. The number they call from seems legitimate as it appears on their website. I have no record of ever creating an account with them or confirmation email of sending a transfer.\n\n### Comment ID l1bfwbq with +1 score by [(Hmhowboutno, Reddit, 2024-04-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/1c21ae0/is_someone_using_my_info_to_commit_fraud_remitly/l1bfwbq/) (in reply to ID kzttqub):\nIt’s so easy for people to use other’s numbers mistakenly using Remitly, I feel like they should verify phone numbers beforehand to be honest. Thanks for sharing and good luck trying to contact Remitly to get those automated texts/calls to stop!\n\n#### Comment ID ln9m365 with +3 score by [(BaloogaJoe, Reddit, 2024-09-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/1c21ae0/is_someone_using_my_info_to_commit_fraud_remitly/ln9m365/) (in reply to ID l1bfwbq):\nAnd they don’t validate emails either, I’ve been getting emails for someone’s declined transactions but never once received an email validation request. I can see the persons name, address and phone number as well as the phone number for patron they’re attempting to send money to. This is extremely poor security measures for a fintech that must comply with US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Rule 2090. Remitly seems like a disreputable in my eyes company even if they aren’t a scam or fraudulent if they can allow this to occur. Their customer service was little help. They wanted me to verify the birthdate on the account to delete the email from the account. I told them I cannot do this because I didn’t create the account, I’m only receiving the emails. It took me requesting to speak to someone in fraud (through chat) and a total of 45 minutes of my time to get the email removed from the account."

He only gave his first name , I asked about his last name, as I would assume that maybe there is more than one Joel working at Remitly! He said that he is not comfortable with giving his last name !! He even got sort of offended, But has the nerve to ask me to upload a photo of someone else’s ID!! \n\nMrs Joel seems to understand PI privacy very well when it comes to his own privacy but other people PI/he doesn’t care!!\n\nRemitly!! What is going on! Are you being hacked !!\n\nCan you please hire people with nice soft skills also!! That  mysterious person who has first name only called Joel is very rude person, talking to him almost turned into a fight, while all what I’m trying to is use your do business.\n\nIf it’s true that all of the sudden it’s mandatory to provide a copy of the receiver ID, then ask the  receiver  to do so when they receive the money. What usually happens at the time of receiving money. The receiver would show ID.\n\nBut keeping a copy of a government official ID is in violation of federal laws in this scenario!! Receiver only required to show ID when receiving money that matches the info on the transaction!\n\nCan someone look into this seriously and update me!\nI’m seriously concerned, this seems to be a fraud!\nI’m going to file a complain to FTC!\n\nI work in fintech!! This definitely seems to be a fraud!!",

I see people stating that they will receive their refund within three months. I see that there is no way to reach someone that could help us through the company. That there is only customer service that are not fully trained to help us, except to say that somebody will call us. Nobody has called me. This is my first time using this. The computer says everything is great, but nothing is good. I have talked to the bank my girlfriend and I said money to has talked with the bank. It never went through, but it says it’s there. How could they lie about this? Why would they fraud and then when I asked for the money returned they’re gonna keep pushing forward. I have seen on your site numbers to call in case fraud or anything like this happens. We are protective by our government so I will make that call. I will send that letter about this company. Should not be allowed for them to do this return the money don’t play the game with your users. It is my money that you were playing with. That’s not fair. You are hurting so many people. I’m usually very careful, but I’m going back to MoneyGram. At least I know I can reach their customer service that can actually help me at that moment.\n\nSecond part: \nFind a way to complete transactions correctly. Not state it is complete when never fully completed into bank account . \n\nExplain better process of how you can help a first time deposit . \n\nContact bank and assist transaction . \n\nThis is no way to send money if not correct . \n\nWill go back to MONEYGRAM . \n\nOnly good you have is one representative stated to wait a few days for us to investigate. \n\nSecond representative seen the investigation and noticed no way to help so refund was completed within one minute . \n\nRemitly can hire good hearted people but as a company they are not ready to serve the demand that is needed to process transfers .",

For God’s sake its a really small transaction Imagine what you guys would do to a large transaction? Have a fit, close the company or call your therapist? Whenever I chatted to customer service they didn’t have an answer, they even don’t tell you where is the problem, their answer is “we have talked to the proper department and it will be done” What is proper department Seriously pathetic Cancelled the transfer and will never use this service again!!!!!!",

          "advice": "COO’s goodwill tour is well-intended, but not working.\r\n Analytics / Analytics Engineering / Data Engineering functions &amp; tools are not well aligned to the market; lack of a VP+ leader in this space means that no one is representing these interests at the executive level. \r\nYou can’t fix the product or the cultural decay if you don’t fix the issues at the top. \r\nIt’s a public company now, we need to hold a higher bar than this for our managers and leaders.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "Product/business \r\nCore product is not up to par with competitors. PMs get the blame for this, but 1) leadership is unclear on its priorities 2) Many Engineering teams have been understaffed (1-3 engineers for core parts of the product) for years. Choice to move many Engineering teams to cheaper markets (Poland, elsewhere) has strained communication between Engineering &amp; US-based PMs and the organization has been slow to do anything to respond to complaints about the risk &amp; inefficiency this creates. New initiatives have all fizzled so far (though maybe it’s good that the business is willing to recognize a sunk cost fallacy, at some point). \r\n\r\nData \r\nUnclear what the relationship between Data Engineering/ML Analytics is supposed to be. The leadership of the former does their own thing and only brings in Analytics when their plans are 90% done. No VP+ role in data, no career progression for Data Scientists, roles not aligned to industry standards. Just not a mature organization from a data standpoint. \r\n\r\nCustomer Centricity \r\nIt seems like the business is getting further away from customers, not closer. Passbook (closed neobank initiative) was targeted at Mexican immigrants to the US, but run by an all-white team. North America markets drive the business, but over the past year, now very few people in the Business team have ever lived in North America (no one in leadership; run from London). Understanding of customer needs, lives is super uneven across teams.\r\n\r\n Leadership \r\nAlmost everyone is in their first-ever C-level role. “Stay paranoid” attitude is not playing out in a healthy way. Infighting, scapegoating, excusing bad behavior &amp; mismanagement for favorite directors/VPs is spilling over and corrupting the great culture the company was known for in recent years. \r\n\r\nHR\r\n Chaotic. Rife with personal conflicts, toxic personalities allowed to flourish. Turnover is incredibly high in the recruiting, HR Business Partner, and HR ops groups. HR representatives seem to be lacking in some core training around employee conflict resolution, DEI, even labor laws (some HR reps supervise staff in multiple countries). Tendency is for HR reps to make immediate problems go away for Management at the expense of protecting the company. If you’re Level 4 or below, asking HR for help will probably only make things worse.\r\n\r\n DEI \r\n“Diverse” candidates be warned. The fact that most of the DEI team left this year tells you what you need to know. Smooth-talking men from well-represented backgrounds &amp; elite schools are strongly encouraged to apply. The company has plenty of data on how bad attrition for women, POC, and people who have taken FMLA is at &amp; above Level 3, they just won’t talk about it. Is it worse than other corporations? TBD, but it’s certainly not better. The progress the former DEI team was making stalled out around IPO time. Being in an employee resource group, particularly in leadership, can feel like wearing a “Troublemaker” label. \r\n\r\nGender: Most engineering teams are all men; where there’s a woman on the team, she’s definitely the one being asked to do all of the team lunch reservations. Women can enjoy the comments about how great their smile is, how emotional they are, but how they’re not very strategic in their performance reviews. It's definitely not like this in every team, but these things happen way more often than they should, and employees have no recourse when they do.  Men can get satisfactory performance reviews for shipping nothing, so long as their boss likes them. Underperforming men leave when they get new external jobs. High-performing women get assigned additional tasks like mentoring, recruiting, cultural centricity promotion, &amp; emotional labor-type work that the company will never reward, and then be told they did not drive enough business value at their next review. The departure rate for women at L3 and above (across functions) has visibly accelerated since Q4 2022. Multiple well-respected women who have complained about gender bias issues in the past year have mysteriously had their roles eliminated. \r\n\r\nRace: Management has expressed skepticism that ‘diverse’ teams can actually “perform” to managers that make an effort to make the company more representative of the customer base (immigrants). Only a few VP+ leaders are past the ‘I don’t see race and gender’ and ‘I have a black friend/I have a daughter’ level on their DEI learning. \r\n\r\nFMLA &amp; Disability, new parents: As another review said, if you need disability accommodations, good luck. Nursing mothers pressured to do non-essential travel, managers told that covid illnesses are not an acceptable reason to push back non-business-critical work. New mothers have had it made clear to them that having a baby and taking leave is the reason they weren’t promoted.",

        "cons": "Product/business \r\nCore product is not up to par with competitors. PMs get the blame for this, but 1) leadership is unclear on its priorities 2) Many Engineering teams have been understaffed (1-3 engineers for core parts of the product) for years. Choice to move many Engineering teams to cheaper markets (Poland, elsewhere) has strained communication between Engineering &amp; US-based PMs and the organization has been slow to do anything to respond to complaints about the risk &amp; inefficiency this creates. New initiatives have all fizzled so far (though maybe it’s good that the business is willing to recognize a sunk cost fallacy, at some point). \r\n\r\nData \r\nUnclear what the relationship between Data Engineering/ML Analytics is supposed to be. The leadership of the former does their own thing and only brings in Analytics when their plans are 90% done. No VP+ role in data, no career progression for Data Scientists, roles not aligned to industry standards. Just not a mature organization from a data standpoint. \r\n\r\nCustomer Centricity \r\nIt seems like the business is getting further away from customers, not closer. Passbook (closed neobank initiative) was targeted at Mexican immigrants to the US, but run by an all-white team. North America markets drive the business, but over the past year, now very few people in the Business team have ever lived in North America (no one in leadership; run from London). Understanding of customer needs, lives is super uneven across teams.\r\n\r\n Leadership \r\nAlmost everyone is in their first-ever C-level role. “Stay paranoid” attitude is not playing out in a healthy way. Infighting, scapegoating, excusing bad behavior &amp; mismanagement for favorite directors/VPs is spilling over and corrupting the great culture the company was known for in recent years. \r\n\r\nHR\r\n Chaotic. Rife with personal conflicts, toxic personalities allowed to flourish. Turnover is incredibly high in the recruiting, HR Business Partner, and HR ops groups. HR representatives seem to be lacking in some core training around employee conflict resolution, DEI, even labor laws (some HR reps supervise staff in multiple countries). Tendency is for HR reps to make immediate problems go away for Management at the expense of protecting the company. If you’re Level 4 or below, asking HR for help will probably only make things worse.\r\n\r\n DEI \r\n“Diverse” candidates be warned. The fact that most of the DEI team left this year tells you what you need to know. Smooth-talking men from well-represented backgrounds &amp; elite schools are strongly encouraged to apply. The company has plenty of data on how bad attrition for women, POC, and people who have taken FMLA is at &amp; above Level 3, they just won’t talk about it. Is it worse than other corporations? TBD, but it’s certainly not better. The progress the former DEI team was making stalled out around IPO time. Being in an employee resource group, particularly in leadership, can feel like wearing a “Troublemaker” label. \r\n\r\nGender: Most engineering teams are all men; where there’s a woman on the team, she’s definitely the one being asked to do all of the team lunch reservations. Women can enjoy the comments about how great their smile is, how emotional they are, but how they’re not very strategic in their performance reviews. It's definitely not like this in every team, but these things happen way more often than they should, and employees have no recourse when they do.  Men can get satisfactory performance reviews for shipping nothing, so long as their boss likes them. Underperforming men leave when they get new external jobs. High-performing women get assigned additional tasks like mentoring, recruiting, cultural centricity promotion, &amp; emotional labor-type work that the company will never reward, and then be told they did not drive enough business value at their next review. The departure rate for women at L3 and above (across functions) has visibly accelerated since Q4 2022. Multiple well-respected women who have complained about gender bias issues in the past year have mysteriously had their roles eliminated. \r\n\r\nRace: Management has expressed skepticism that ‘diverse’ teams can actually “perform” to managers that make an effort to make the company more representative of the customer base (immigrants). Only a few VP+ leaders are past the ‘I don’t see race and gender’ and ‘I have a black friend/I have a daughter’ level on their DEI learning. \r\n\r\nFMLA &amp; Disability, new parents: As another review said, if you need disability accommodations, good luck. Nursing mothers pressured to do non-essential travel, managers told that covid illnesses are not an acceptable reason to push back non-business-critical work. New mothers have had it made clear to them that having a baby and taking leave is the reason they weren’t promoted.",

A lot of people really do want to do right by their colleagues, but more and more, incentives don't encourage that.

      "# [Remitly Releases Second Annual Global Impact Report by Ali Mollhoff on 2024-06-18](https://news.remitly.com/community-social-impact/2023-global-impact-report/)\nRemitly is proud to announce the launch of our second annual Global Impact Report, highlighting the progress we made in 2023 toward our global impact vision to transform lives across borders by creating financial inclusion and strengthening community resilience.\n\nThis vision reflects the positive impact that our products can have on the customers and communities we serve, as well as our responsibility to protect people, our operations, and the planet for the long term. To achieve this, our ethos is to do good with what we’re good at—tackling the challenges we are uniquely positioned to solve through our products, business practices, and in partnerships with our people and global communities.\n\nA few highlights across each of our impact priorities:\n\nFinancial Inclusion and Innovation In 2023, Remitly connected communities across borders by facilitating nearly $40 billion in transactions, at costs that are rapidly approaching— and in many cases achieving—the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal of 3%. Additionally, we are proud to offer our services in 17 languages, connecting customers to over 4.2 billion bank accounts, over 1.2 billion mobile wallets, and approximately 460,000 cash pick-up options worldwide.\n\nSecure and Ethical TransactionsWe’re committed to building trusted financial products that protect our customers and deliver secure and ethical transactions. In Q4 2023, over 95% of transactions on our platform required no customer support, and our total transaction losses (including fraud, chargebacks, and other disbursement losses) represented just 0.10% of our total 2023 send volume and just 0.15% in the previous year.\n\nCustomer-centric, Inclusive, and Diverse Global CultureAt Remitly, our global teams are united by a shared commitment to serving our customers. We believe that building a diverse and inclusive culture enables us to better understand and meet the needs of our customers around the world.

(NASDAQ: RELY), a trusted provider of digital financial services that transcend borders, reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“I am grateful to our customers and global teams for the exceptional third quarter results,” said Matt Oppenheimer, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Remitly. “As our performance in the third quarter exceeded expectations, we are pleased to increase our 2024 outlook for both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. We are excited about growth opportunities in 2025 and beyond as we execute on our vision of transforming lives with trusted financial services that transcend borders.”\n\nThird Quarter 2024 Highlights and Key Operating Data\n\n(All comparisons relative to the third quarter of 2023)\n\nActive customers increased to 7.3 million, from 5.4 million, up 35%.\n\nSend volume increased to $14.5 billion, from $10.2 billion, up 42%.\n\nRevenue totaled $336.5 million, compared to $241.6 million, up 39%.\n\nNet income was $1.9 million, compared to net loss of $35.7 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $46.7 million, compared to $10.5 million, up 345%.\n\n2024 Financial Outlook\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, Remitly currently expects:\n\nTotal revenue in the range of $1.250 billion to $1.254 billion, representing a growth rate of 32% to 33% year over year. This outlook reflects an increase from our prior revenue outlook in the range of $1.230 billion to $1.250 billion.\n\nTo remain in a GAAP net loss position for 2024 and for Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $108 million to $112 million. This outlook reflects an increase from our prior Adjusted EBITDA outlook in the range of $90 million and $100 million.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, Remitly currently expects:\n\nTotal revenue in the range of $338 million to $342 million, representing a growth rate of 28% to 29% year over year.\n\nA GAAP net loss position for the fourth quarter of 2024 and for Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $17 million to $21 million.\n\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this earnings release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” We have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of forecasted Adjusted EBITDA to forecasted GAAP net income (loss) or to forecasted GAAP income (loss) before income taxes within this earnings release because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, calculate certain reconciling items with confidence due to the variability, complexity, and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from forecasted Adjusted EBITDA. These items include, but are not limited to, income taxes and stock-based compensation expense, which are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. The variability of these items could have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\nNote: All percentage changes described within this press release are calculated using amounts in the Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), for which revenue and active customers are presented in thousands and send volume is presented in millions. Rounding differences may occur when individually calculating percentages or totals from rounded amounts included within the press release body as compared to the amounts included within the Company’s SEC filings.\n\nWebcast Information\n\nRemitly will host a webcast at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, October 30, 2024 to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results. The live webcast and investor presentation will be accessible on Remitly’s website at https://ir.remitly.com. A webcast replay will be available on our website at https://ir.remitly.com following the live event.\n\nWe have used, and intend to continue to use, the Investor Relations section of our website at https://ir.remitly.com as a means of disclosing material nonpublic information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nSome of the financial information and data contained in this earnings release, such as Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expenses, have not been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We regularly review our key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our performance, identify trends affecting our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information for management and investors in assessing our historical and future operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expenses are key output measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance, inform future operating plans, and make strategic long-term decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources. Remitly believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expenses provides additional tools to assess operational performance and trends in, and in comparing Remitly’s financial measures with, other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Remitly’s non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Because of the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures, you should consider the non-GAAP financial measures presented herein in conjunction with Remitly’s financial statements and the related notes thereto. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in this press release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted by (i) interest (income) expense, net, (ii) provision for income taxes, (iii) noncash charges of depreciation and amortization, (iv) gains and losses from the remeasurement of foreign currency assets and liabilities into their functional currency, (v) noncash charges associated with our donation of common stock in connection with our Pledge 1% commitment, (vi) noncash stock-based compensation expense, net, and (vii) certain acquisition, integration, restructuring, and other costs. We calculate non-GAAP operating expenses as our GAAP operating expenses adjusted by (i) noncash stock-based compensation expense, net, (ii) noncash charges associated with our donation of common stock in connection with our Pledge 1% commitment, as well as (iii) certain acquisition, integration, restructuring, and other costs.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future operating results and financial position, including our fiscal year 2024 financial outlook, including forecasted fiscal year 2024 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, anticipated future expenses and investments, expectations relating to certain of our key financial and operating metrics, our business strategy and plans, market growth, our market position and potential market opportunities, and our objectives for future operations. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “potential,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “could,” “would,” “project,” “plan,” “target,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s expectations, assumptions, and projections based on information available at the time the statements were made. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including risks and uncertainties related to our ability to successfully execute our business and growth strategy, our ability to achieve and maintain future profitability, our ability to further penetrate our existing customer base and expand our customer base in existing and new corridors, our ability to expand into broader financial services, our ability to expand internationally, the effects of seasonal trends on our results of operations, the current inflationary environment, our expectations concerning relationships with third parties, including strategic, banking, and disbursement partners, our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our ability to maintain the security and availability of our solutions, the success of any acquisitions or investments that we make, our ability to compete effectively, our ability to stay in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, our ability to buy foreign currency at generally advantageous rates, and the effects of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, including regulatory changes, on our customers and business operations. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Further information on risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from forecasted results is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 to be filed with the SEC, and within our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC, which are or will be available on our website at https://ir.remitly.com and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

      "# [Fintech industry veteran, Eugenio Nigro, joins Remitly to drive global growth by Irene Keliher on 2017-09-27](https://blog.remitly.com/news/gene-nigro-joins-remitly/)\nSEATTLE, September 27, 2017 — Today Remitly announced its new Vice President of Global Business Development, Eugenio (Gene) Nigro. Nigro will drive the expansion of Remitly’s global footprint and influence as it continues to accelerate its growth, now transferring over $3 billion in annualized volume. The company also announced today its expanded physical footprint, opening an office in Nicaragua.\n\n“Our goal is to bring transparency, security, and ease to people sending money to loved ones throughout the world,” says Matt Oppenheimer, CEO of Remitly. “Gene’s deep experience in the industry will be instrumental as we work to meet global demand and aggressively grow our global footprint. We’re excited to have him join the team.”\n\nNigro has more than 20 years experience in developing and implementing international strategic and tactical business development plans. For the past 10 years, Nigro worked for PayPal and Xoom where he led the Xoom business development function for Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Prior to PayPal’s acquisition of Xoom, he was Vice President of Business Development for Latin America, where he contributed to the company’s revenue growth and streamlined distribution channels. Prior to Xoom, he managed strategic promotional integrations at Sigue Corporation, helping maximize the company’s brand exposure and recognition.\n\nNigro also held senior management roles at Western Union, where he developed the company’s presence in Latin America and country-specific strategic marketing, business, and product development plans.\n\n“Remitly’s incredible commitment to helping hard-working immigrants send money across the world sets the company apart,” said Nigro. “That human-centric approach is essential when creating technology-driven solutions in our ever-changing, globally-connected world. This product provides not only ease and savings, but also the confidence to both those sending money and those receiving it.”\n\nRemitly’s new office, located in Nicaragua’s capital Managua, will open with 75 employees focused on customer service and risk operations for its rapidly expanding Latin American user base. This follows the opening of offices in London, England and Manila, Philippines as Remitly continues to expand globally.",
      "# [Remitly taps ads to woo new clients by Lynne Marek on 2024-01-10](https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/remitly-international-remittances-advertising-online/704148/)\nDive Brief:\n\nCross-border payments company Remitly boosted its advertising budget last year with a two-fold goal: to build its brand and attract new customers, CEO Matt Oppenheimer said in an interview.\n\nSeattle-based Remitly increased online ads, posted on social media sites such as Facebook and YouTube, to drive measurable customer acquisition, what it calls “performance marketing.” It also advertised in places like airports, to build brand awareness more broadly. Most of the ads are for performance marketing.\n\n“We’re doing very targeted brand marketing to, again, kind of water that tree to grow that fruit to make our performance marketing even more effective,” Oppenheimer said in an interview last week.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWith the increased marketing, Remitly has sought to expand its client set. That’s more the goal than increasing use of its services by existing customers, Oppenheimer said. For most of Remitly’s customers, the payments they’re sending, often to friends and family, are for non-discretionary needs like “basic living expenses, for emergency medical expenses, for college tuition,” he said.\n\nRemitly’s marketing expense, which includes advertising, rose 24% for the first nine months of last year, over 2022, to $159 million, as revenue jumped 47% for the nine-month period to nearly $680 million, according to the company’s most recently filed quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nonetheless, the company hasn’t been profitable, posting losses for the nine-month periods in both years, the filing said.\n\n“We understand performance-based marketing should have relatively short payback periods (measured by new users) while the benefits from brand marketing are typically realized over time,” analysts at the financial firm William Blair said in a Jan. 2 note to clients.\n\nAside from attracting customers, Remitly may draw potential acquirers too, according to the William Blair report. The financial firm included Remitly on a list of companies that may be attractive acquisitions because their stock prices have declined over the past year. A spokesperson for Remitly declined to comment on that possibility.\n\nOppenheimer sees plenty of room for growth, with the company having penetrated only 2% of the market, he estimates.\n\nRemitly in November extended a partnership with Visa after first partnering with the card network giant in 2019. In 2021, it also won investment backing from Visa and sold shares in an initial public offering that same year. Nonetheless, it has also retrenched in some areas too, pulling back on a digital bank account service called Passbook last year.\n\nRemitly aims to attract those remittance users who may have become dissatisfied, for whatever reason, with rival services, offered by competitors that include MoneyGram and Western Union. When consumers go online looking for alternatives, Oppenheimer expects his company’s ads may catch the consumer’s eye.\n\nThe bulk of remittance services are still handled offline, by small convenience stores in the U.S. as well as similar style bodegas in other countries. That’s because customers must have a high degree of trust in the outlets they’re working with, given the personal information provided and the transfer of money, Oppenheimer said.\n\nRecent global economic trouble doesn’t bother Oppenheimer because his remittance customers tend to be very “resilient,” with a need to send money to other places regardless of financial challenges, he said. “There’s a predictability and a priority and a resilience of our customers,” the CEO said.",

And sadly, because of this volume, certain scammers try to trick people through different money transfer scams.\n\nHere at Remitly, we want to help you understand how these money transfer scams work and recognize the warning signs of potential fraud so you can keep your money safe.\n\n11 Common Money Transfer Scams\n\nAs people become better at recognizing fraudulent activities, such as credit card theft and wire transfer fraud, scammers are also improving their methods.\n\nSince tracing many of these scams might be complicated, your best protection is learning to spot potential fraudulent acts when you encounter them.\n\nThese are some of the most common scams we encounter here at Remitly as we work tirelessly to keep our customers’ information safe.\n\nPlease note, if you send a transfer to a scammer, we might not be able to help, and you could lose your money.\n\n1. Family emergency scams\n\nIn this type of scam, the victim is led to believe that they are sending funds to help a loved one or friend in an emergency situation.\n\nScammers exploit the victim’s natural worry for someone they care about. This can involve a car accident, being stranded at an airport, or avoiding arrest‌.\n\nThe scammer may place an urgent phone call, posing as a relative, friend, or loved one or as a figure of authority such as a law enforcement official or medical doctor.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nVerify the emergency by contacting the loved one or friend directly.\n\nDo not rush the transaction. Take time to verify the situation.\n\nBe suspicious of requests for secrecy or urgency.\n\nBe wary of unsolicited calls or messages from unknown individuals.\n\n2. Extortion scams\n\nAn extortion scam involves the act of obtaining an individual’s property, assets, or money through threatened or actual force, violence, and intimidation. Sextortion is a type of extortion where a perpetrator threatens to expose sexually compromising information, such as sexually explicit private images or videos of the victim, unless the victim meets certain demands, usually money.\n\nVictims tend to be younger adults or elders.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nBe cautious about who you connect with on social media and dating sites.\n\nDo not engage in explicit video chat or exchange sexually explicit images with strangers.\n\nDo not send money to someone who is threatening to expose intimate photos or videos.\n\nBe wary of false communication from law enforcement officials.\n\n3. Threats/Blackmail scams\n\nThreats/blackmail scams involve scammers unlawfully obtaining money from a victim through coercion. The scammer threatens to harm the victim if they do not cooperate.\n\nThe scammer may relate personal information in the email or call to add intimidation. They may threaten physical harm, claim to know where you live or work, and threaten to hurt you or your loved ones unless you pay up.\n\nScammers may also threaten the victim with arrest or jail time if they do not comply with the demands.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nDo not comply with the scammer’s demands.\n\nContact law enforcement immediately if you feel threatened or scared.\n\nBe wary of unsolicited calls or messages from unknown individuals.\n\nBe cautious about sharing personal information online or in response to unsolicited calls or messages.\n\n4. Imposter scams\n\nIn an imposter scam, a scammer poses as an authoritative individual and requests money to sort out a false situation.\n\nScammers may also pose as representatives from a reputable business (business impersonators), or financial institutions and make false claims of fraudulent charges that need to be reviewed or refunded or as overpayments to steal from the victim.\n\nThey make false claims about fraudulent charges and bank transfers, refunds, shipment issues, or other bogus fees that will cause the victim to share personal and/or financial information. Scammers may even hack the customer’s phone in order to process unauthorized transactions.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nBe cautious about sharing personal information online or in response to unsolicited calls or messages.\n\nVerify the legitimacy of the representative or business.\n\nDo not share financial information over the phone or email.\n\nDo not trust unsolicited communication from unknown individuals or businesses.\n\n5. Investment scams\n\nInvestment scams often sound “too good to be true” or offer “risk-free” investment opportunities. They pressure victims to invest immediately, sometimes indicating the opportunity is for a limited time.\n\nThe victim is often lured through social media apps or cold calls/email inquiries.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nBe cautious of investment opportunities that sound too good to be true or pressure you to invest immediately.\n\nDo your research and verify the legitimacy of the investment before investing any money.\n\nDo not invest money you cannot afford to lose.\n\n6. Romance scams\n\nIn a romance scam, the victim is tricked into thinking they’ve found true love online. Scammers play with your emotions, pretending to be interested in a romantic relationship. They use flattering words and stolen pictures to win trust and affection.\n\nOnce they have the victim hooked, they ask for money or gift cards. They might claim it’s for a plane ticket to meet up or to cover unexpected medical expenses. They prey on the desire for love and companionship, making it hard to say no.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nVerify the person’s identity by doing a reverse image search or asking for a video call.\n\nBe suspicious of requests for secrecy or urgency, as scammers often use these tactics.\n\nBe cautious of unsolicited messages or calls from strangers professing love or interest.\n\n7. Tech support scams\n\nTech support scams involve scammers posing as representatives from reputable companies like Microsoft or Apple and claiming that the victim’s computer requires tech services in order to gain access remotely and steal from the customer.\n\nTypically, victims receive an unsolicited phone call, text message, or email from an individual claiming to represent a company’s “Tech Support,” “Help Desk,” “IT Department,” or a similar office.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nRemember that reputable companies will never contact you out of the blue and ask for access to your computer.\n\nNever provide personal or financial information to unsolicited callers or email senders.\n\nIndependently verify the legitimacy of any request for tech support services.\n\n8. Immigration scams\n\nIf you receive a call from someone claiming to be an immigration official, it’s okay to feel suspicious immediately. Scammers may call you and claim there’s a problem with your immigration documents that you can solve by making an immediate money transfer or providing your account information.\n\nThey may even provide personal information or make threats of deportation, but you should never give out personal financial information.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nRemember that the USCIS and the government will never ask you to transfer money to an individual. You can only pay any fees on the USCIS online portal or Pay.gov.\n\nDon’t provide any personal or financial information to people you don’t trust.\n\nBe sure to contact USCIS directly if you need help with any immigration processes.\n\nUnfortunately, you may come across other scams as the methods change frequently. Learning to recognize general warning signs of scams can help you stay safe.\n\n9. Prize scams\n\nWith the prize wire money and transfer scam, criminals attempt to steal money with phony sweepstakes, lotteries, or contests. Usually, the scam begins with an unexpected email or phone call saying that you won a cash prize in another country.\n\nThe scammer might ask for your bank account information so that they can directly deposit the winnings and then use the information to conduct fraudulent activity with your bank account.\n\nAnother version of the scam works similarly to some other money and wire transfer scams. The fraudsters send a fake check to the victim and then tell the victim to wire money to them to cover fees like currency conversion or processing fees.\n\nAfter you deposit the check and transfer or wire money, you find the check fake. You may be subject to fees from your bank and be out the transferred or wired money.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nResearch any unfamiliar contests or sweepstakes before wiring money.\n\nNever initiate money or wire transfers until you’re certain checks have cleared.\n\nCall the issuing bank of any check received to verify funds and authenticity.\n\nNever give your bank account information to an unknown party.\n\n10. Job scams\n\nA job scam is when a fraudster advertises a fake job, such as a secret shopper position or work-from-home opportunity, through social media, fake websites, and even roadside signs.\n\nWhen you express interest in the job, the scammer may put you through a fake interview process, asking you to answer questions and provide personal information.\n\nThen, they’ll tell you that you’re hired but explain that you need to transfer or wire money to cover processing fees to enroll you in their work-from-home program, to pay for necessary equipment, or to complete a mandatory training course.\n\nYou only find out that the job was fake all along after the money’s been sent.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nCheck the Better Business Bureau and state business registration records to confirm the validity of companies.\n\nBe wary of sending money for any employment opportunity.\n\nUse caution for any job offer that seems too good to be true.\n\n11. Marketplace scams\n\nMarketplace schemes seek to take advantage of people buying and selling things through Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, eBay, and other sites.\n\nThere are two versions of this scam. With the first, a fake buyer asks if they can pay for an item via money order, personal check, or cashier’s check.\n\nIf the seller says yes, the buyer sends a fake check or money order for more than the sale price. The buyer will then ask the seller to transfer or wire the extra money back to them. After they go through with wiring or transferring money, the check turns out to be bad.\n\nFake sellers can also try to perpetrate this money or wire transfer scam. With this version, a fraudster lists an appealing item for sale on a marketplace site.\n\nIf you express interest, they will ask you to send money or a wire transfer and tell you they will ship the item after receiving the funds.\n\nOnce you wire money to them, they will contact you and say there is a problem. Most often, fake sellers will claim that they didn’t receive money and ask you to provide the money transfer control number so that they can track the payment. If you give them this number, they will pick up cash and never send the purchased item.\n\nA common marketplace scam is called a fake check scam in which the scammer requests the recipient to cash a check for a purchase or service and then asks to wire part of the funds back to cover certain expenses.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nDon’t accept a personal check, money order, or cashier’s check when selling things online.\n\nOnly process transactions through sales platforms, being wary of anyone who asks you to go outside the system to avoid fees.\n\nCheck reviews and ratings for buyers and sellers.\n\nNever agree to wire money to pay for something that you buy through an online marketplace.\n\nCommon signs of financial scams\n\nNot sure whether something is a scam? Watch out for these red flags:\n\nThey insist on handling everything by email, text, or social media messages.\n\nThere are misspellings or serious grammar issues in communications.\n\nThe return email address is strange or unrecognized.\n\nThey put pressure on you to send money quickly.\n\nThey ask you to send money to a foreign country even though they claim to be in the U.S.\n\nYou’re asked to use cashier’s checks, wire transfers, or other potentially untraceable funds.\n\nStaying safe from money transfer scams\n\nFollow these steps to safeguard your money and your information:\n\nNever give out personal information on an unsolicited call or message.\n\nDon’t send money to someone you don’t know personally.\n\nContact family members at known phone numbers if you receive an unfamiliar request from them.\n\nRegularly update your passwords.\n\nInstall blockers for pop-ups and antivirus software.\n\nDo not share your login information for Remitly, online banking information, or login credentials for other financial apps.\n\nReport money and wire transfer scams\n\nIf you discover that someone has stolen funds from you, act quickly by contacting Remitly or the wire transfer provider you used. In some cases, it may be possible to recover your hard-earned money.\n\nEven if a fraudster was unsuccessful in committing money transfer or wire fraud because you caught onto the scheme, you should report the attempt. The Federal Trade Commission offers a detailed guide on how to report wire transfer scams that you can access here.\n\nAlthough criminals do try to exploit the wire transfer system to their advantage, wire and money transfers are still a convenient way to send money to your loved ones located abroad. By following the tips outlined in this article, you can do so more safely and protect yourself from fraud.",

      "# [Sanctuary Cities in the U.S.: 2024 Immigrant’s Guide by Irene Keliher on 2024-08-08](https://blog.remitly.com/lifestyle-culture/sanctuary-cities-in-united-states/)\nSanctuary cities: the very name feels mysterious. What are they? How many American sanctuary cities exist?\n\nIn this Remitly guide, we’ll give you answers to common questions about sanctuary cities in the U.S.—including myths vs. facts.\n\nSanctuary city basics\n\nSanctuary cities: U.S. cities with policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.\n\nKey protections: Reduced local law enforcement involvement in immigration matters.\n\nNon-interference: Sanctuary cities don’t prevent federal immigration authorities from enforcing immigration laws. They simply don’t actively assist in these efforts.\n\nDispelling myths about sanctuary cities: a quick guide\n\nMyth: Sanctuary cities harbor criminals.\n\nFact: Sanctuary cities focus on building trust within communities, which can actually lead to better crime reporting and cooperation with local law enforcement.\n\nMyth: They defy federal law.\n\nFact: Sanctuary cities operate within legal bounds, choosing not to use local resources for federal immigration enforcement, but they do not obstruct federal law enforcement actions.\n\nMyth: Increase in crime rates\n\nFact: Studies show no significant correlation between sanctuary policies and increased crime rates. In fact, some studies suggest lower crime rates in these cities.\n\nMyth: Sanctuary cities provide legal immunity\n\nFact: These cities do not offer legal protection from deportation. They limit cooperation with federal agencies but do not impede federal immigration law enforcement.\n\nMyth: They are funded by the federal government.\n\nFact: Sanctuary cities primarily use local or state funding and are not specifically funded by the federal government for their sanctuary policies.\n\nWhat is a sanctuary city?\n\nThe term “sanctuary city” often appears in the news, but most people don’t fully understand it. This term refers to a municipality that may limit its cooperation with the federal government’s efforts to enforce immigration law.\n\nThe sanctuary movement in the United States arose during the 1980s when the federal government turned away asylum seekers who were seeking protection and arriving from politically unstable countries in Central America that were engulfed in civil wars.\n\nIn 1982, several churches in the Southwestern U.S. publicly declared themselves sanctuaries for refugees. These houses of worship followed the tradition of churches that helped hide enslaved people in defiance of the Fugitive Slave Act enacted in the U.S. during the years leading up to the Civil War.\n\nInspired by the churches, local officials in San Francisco passed the symbolic “City of Refuge” resolution in 1985. It prohibited the use of city funds to assist federal immigration enforcement.\n\nSince then, many other cities, counties, and states have passed ordinances to defend immigrants and refugees. Sanctuary jurisdictions protect immigrants from persecution and inform them about their rights. Some places refer to these laws as a welcoming city ordinance rather than a sanctuary policy.\n\nIn some cases, they may issue immigrants official documentation and identification to help them assimilate into society. Local authorities may also offer websites and apps for immigrants to assist them with finding healthcare services, school districts, and legal help.\n\nAs of December 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies had identified more than 170 sanctuary cities and counties in the U.S.\n\nList of sanctuary cities\n\nThere are municipalities and counties across the continental U.S. with sanctuary policies. Sanctuary cities vary in size and have different policies. However, they all have one thing in common: a policy of welcoming immigrants.\n\nSome places that have declared sanctuary city status or are in a county with a sanctuary policy include:\n\nAlexandria, VA\n\nBaltimore, MD\n\nBoston, MA\n\nChicago, IL\n\nColumbus, OH\n\nDenver, CO\n\nDetroit, MI\n\nHartford, CT\n\nIowa City, IA\n\nJackson, MS\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nMinneapolis, MN\n\nMontpelier, VT\n\nNewark, NJ\n\nNew Orleans, LA\n\nNew York City, NY\n\nOklahoma City, OK\n\nPhiladelphia, PA\n\nPittsburgh, PA\n\nPortland, OR\n\nProvidence, RI\n\nRaleigh, NC\n\nSan Diego, CA\n\nSan Francisco, CA\n\nSeattle, WA\n\nWashington, DC\n\nHow do sanctuary cities work?\n\nState and local jurisdictions establish their own laws and regulations as a part of their sanctuary city policy. As a result, the specific details of how things work within each city vary.\n\nOne thing sanctuaries have in common is that they limit resources provided to federal immigration authorities attempting to apprehend undocumented immigrants. Let’s look at what happens when police departments encounter an undocumented person in a typical city versus one with a sanctuary policy.\n\nArrests of undocumented immigrants in non-sanctuary cities\n\nIn a non-sanctuary city, local law enforcement usually partners with federal agents. If the police arrest an undocumented person, local law enforcement officers will typically hold the person until U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) can come to the jail and retrieve them.\n\nTo do this, local law enforcement notifies ICE that they have an undocumented suspect in custody and request a detainer. If the detainer request is approved, the person will stay in jail.\n\nThere are some limits to detainers. State or local laws may limit how long a person can be in custody. In this case, the police will hold the suspect for the maximum time, and if the federal authorities fail to arrive before it expires, the person will be released.\n\nArrests of undocumented immigrants in sanctuary cities\n\nIn sanctuary jurisdictions, undocumented immigrants are held as long as any other suspect. Local law enforcement won’t usually contact federal immigration authorities to tell them about an undocumented immigrant in custody.\n\nBecause federal immigration agents won’t be coming for them, the undocumented immigrant can leave detention if the charges are cleared or dropped. The person may also be released if they pay bail or complete a jail sentence.\n\nHow sanctuary city policies benefit law enforcement\n\nDuring debates about sanctuary policy, the benefits of sanctuary status for law enforcement usually fall through the cracks. Although cities adopt sanctuary status to show they’re welcoming to immigrants, goodwill usually isn’t the primary reason for the move.\n\nLaw enforcement is most effective when the local community cooperates. Police can’t investigate crimes if witnesses don’t talk to them, and they can’t stop crimes in progress if no one reports them.\n\nUnfortunately, undocumented immigrants and their relatives may be fearful of the police. They may hesitate to call emergency services or answer a police officer’s questions, even about unrelated matters.\n\nDue to policies enacted by their local governments, sanctuary jurisdictions offer people peace of mind that interactions with the police won’t result in detention. Sanctuary policies build trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement agencies so officers can better serve their cities. As a result, it’s not uncommon for local law enforcement to support sanctuary policies.\n\nWhat protections are afforded to people in sanctuary cities?\n\nThe specific protections afforded to people living in these types of cities in the U.S. vary. Each city has its own laws and regulations. Read on to explore some elements that state and local authorities might include in their sanctuary policies and how sanctuary jurisdictions differ from other places.\n\nProtection from extended detention\n\nIn most areas, undocumented immigrants receive protection from prolonged detention. If arrested, law enforcement won’t hold them beyond the time it takes to clear the charges, post bail established by a judge, or serve a sentence.\n\nReduced local involvement with police raids\n\nSome sanctuary city policies go further. Local law enforcement may refuse to assist with local ICE raids, or they may not offer requested support like additional staffing.\n\nThis fact doesn’t mean ICE raids don’t occur in these types of cities. It simply means the local police won’t assist federal agents with them.\n\nLack of immigration detention centers\n\nSome sanctuary cities and counties prohibit ICE from establishing detention centers within their borders. When governments impose this rule, federal immigration enforcement officers may have to travel further to apprehend an undocumented immigrant.\n\nIncreased privacy\n\nSome sanctuary cities protect people from questions about their immigration status or citizenship status when applying for services. Others limit gathering immigration data from people.\n\nFor example, people may not need to give their immigration status when registering their children for a public school in a sanctuary city. Or, the school district may only be allowed to ask if the child is a U.S. citizen. If the answer is no, the school official can’t ask for the specific immigration status or inquire whether the child has legal status.\n\nSanctuary city laws may also limit how much information government agencies share with federal officials. For example, they may not provide federal immigration enforcement with statistics regarding how many immigrants live in a particular neighborhood or attend a local school.\n\nProtection from ICE officials while in jail\n\nSome sanctuary cities and counties won’t allow ICE agents to enter a jail or prison without a warrant. In these areas, immigration officials must convince a judge to grant a search or arrest warrant before entering. If the judge issues the warrant, undocumented immigrants can be removed from jail or prison by ICE.\n\nWhat sanctuary status doesn’t mean\n\nMany people have the impression that a sanctuary city is a safe harbor for immigrants. However, the idea that someone living in a sanctuary city receives complete protection from federal immigration laws is false.\n\nUndocumented immigrants living in these cities can still be detained by ICE and deported. Sanctuary policies simply mean that local police departments won’t help federal agencies enforce federal immigration law.\n\nUnderstanding immigrant protections\n\nBecause laws governing these types of cities in the U.S. vary greatly, immigrants must become familiar with the protections in the places they live.\n\nRefrain from assuming that you have a set of guaranteed protections if you live in a sanctuary city. Check the county or city website to learn more about your local laws.\n\nWhat is the relationship between the federal government and sanctuary cities?\n\nIn sanctuary cities, the federal government still has jurisdiction over immigration issues, and federal law regarding immigration is still in effect.\n\nSanctuary laws don’t prevent ICE agents or other federal immigration officers from entering a city or apprehending undocumented immigrants. People living in these cities are still subject to the same federal immigration laws as individuals living in other places.\n\nThe difference between sanctuary cities and non-sanctuary cities is the level of cooperation. Law enforcement officers in a sanctuary city will either not partner with ICE or will only assist them a little. In non-sanctuary cities, law enforcement usually works with ICE.\n\nWhat happens when there is a disagreement between a sanctuary city and the federal government?\n\nSanctuary cities aren’t illegal in the U.S. The federal government can’t stop cities and counties from establishing sanctuary policies.\n\nHowever, the federal government’s executive branch has sought to punish or retaliate against these types of cities. In January 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order that blocked these types of cities from receiving federal funding like federal grants.\n\nUltimately, a judge blocked the executive order, ruling that it violated federal law. President Joe Biden rescinded the order in April 2021.\n\nThese historical events show how conflicts between sanctuary cities and the federal government are resolved. The U.S. court system is responsible for ruling on the legality of sanctuary city policies and the federal government’s attempts to restrict them.\n\nLegal disputes between cities and the federal government are typically tried in federal district courts. If either party is dissatisfied with the lower court’s ruling, they may argue their case in federal appeals court. Should the appeals court not be able to settle the matter, the case may go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nImmigrants who believe the federal government violated their rights as a resident of a sanctuary city can take advantage of legal resources to help them navigate the court system. Local affiliates of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Southern Poverty Law Center are good places to start.\n\nWhy are sanctuary cities in the news more often recently?\n\nSanctuary cities have been in the news more frequently over the last few years as politicians leverage immigration to draw support. In 2023, North Dakota passed a law banning sanctuary cities, even though there were no sanctuary policies in effect in the state then.\n\nActs of political theater are also drawing attention to these types of cities. In 2022, Governor Ron Desantis of Florida and Governor Greg Abbott of Texas began transporting immigrants to sanctuary cities like New York, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. Although the governors said they simply require sanctuary cities to assist with immigration, critics argue that these politicians wanted to stir up support for their reelection campaigns.\n\nUnfortunately, discussions about sanctuary cities aren’t often factual. That’s why it’s essential to use trusted sources like government websites to obtain information about sanctuary city policies.\n\nHow might sanctuary cities change in 2024?\n\nIn 2024, these cities may face legislative challenges at the federal level. With the Republicans controlling the House of Representatives, there is an increased chance that bills restricting sanctuary cities may be put forth. However, any legislation would also need to be passed by the U.S. Senate, where they are unlikely to succeed.\n\nThe Biden administration has asked sanctuary cities to consider increasing cooperation between local and federal agencies. In February 2022, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told a group of mayors he hoped that localities that previously refused all assistance to ICE would reconsider. As of September 2023, no sanctuary cities have reconsidered.\n\nKey takeaways for immigrants\n\nBoth immigrants living in sanctuary cities and those who advocate for them must stay informed about laws and regulations.

Real-time and digital-first solutions are among the best ways to address those pain points and alleviate frictions, she said.\n\nMonday (Nov 20), Remitly and Visa said they had expanded their collaboration, first detailed in May 2021, that seeks to streamline cross-border fund flows.\n\nOppenheimer and Gonzalez-Ore noted that the expanded efforts enable Remitly customers in more than 15 countries, including the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Australia, to push funds directly to holders’ Visa debit cards and bank accounts in more than 100 jurisdictions globally. The transfers can be tracked directly through the Remitly app.\n\nTaking Note of the Digital Shift\n\nOppenheimer said that the expansion takes into account the “structural shift” that’s been gaining momentum since the Visa/Remitly collaboration was announced initially, where, traditionally, most remittance activity began and ended at a physical location (such as at remittance agents). The pandemic, of course, moved more individuals to embrace digital options to move funds, using their devices as digitally-enabled endpoints to facilitate push-to-card transactions.\n\nIn terms of the mechanics of the transactions themselves, senders enter a recipient’s name and 16-digit Visa debit card number into the Remitly app in order to send funds to Visa debit cards and to recipients’ bank accounts. At a high level, said Oppenheimer, the move helps bolster Remitly’s bid to expand its network “for customers to send money to 4 billion bank accounts, 1.2 billion mobile wallets and more than 460,000 cash pickup locations.”\n\nFor Visa, said Gonzalez-Ore, the expansion broadens financial inclusion for millions of migrant workers sending money to loved ones globally.\n\nAsked by PYMNTS for an illustrative use case, Oppenheimer offered that 80% of remittance transfers support households’ needs and medical expenses. Funds sent to pay for an individual’s emergency surgery, he said, “are critical. They’re a lifeline,” and speed, reliability and transparency are critical, too.\n\n“Someone who’s sending money home for their child,” he told PYMNTS, “cannot afford for that transaction to be delayed.” Partnering with Visa, he added, enables the funds to be collected and disbursed securely.\n\nEarly Innings, Still\n\nIt’s still early innings in the digital shift that is helping transform remittances, said Oppenheimer, who added that Remitly has only about 2%+ share of the $1.6 trillion in remittances that cross borders each year. The opportunity is there, noted Oppenheimer, to expand beyond remittances and craft financial services ecosystems for immigrants and their families.\n\nAdded Gonzalez-Ore, P2P payments serve as “tip of the spear for a change in money movement.” Consumers have gotten used to the convenience and speed that they’ve enjoyed as part of everyday domestic transactions. They’ll expect the same in cross-border interactions — and remittances, after all, are a form of international P2P payments. We’re headed toward a future where cross-border payroll and other use cases build on the interactions forged through the collaborations between Visa and Remitly.\n\nAs Gonzalez-Ore told PYMNTS, “this is an example of how different players in the ecosystem can come together to change the way things operate today and help evolve money movement…it’s an alignment of goals and we are excited for it to continue for the longer term.”",

But how are its advertising campaigns having an impact?\n\nAttracting new customers – as well as retaining existing ones – is a critical part of any money transfers business, and vital to this is marketing. From social media to traditional advertising campaigns, marketing is a broad space that provides critical ongoing engagement with customers, reaching them not only on obvious full factors such as promotional pricing, but also on values, such as trust and impact.\n\nFor long-established players with strong brand recognition, marketing is a means of building on an often fairly strong existing brand perception, while for others it can mean a partial or even full introduction to a brand. However, not all companies in the money transfers space are spending similar amounts on marketing. Instead, our research shows that one company is significantly outspending its main competitors: Remitly.\n\nIn this report, we take a look at how Remitly is outspending other money transfers players, including Western Union, and consider how its most recent campaign is having an impact.\n\nTopics covered:"

The service is available in 17 languages and offers various options for cash pick-up, making it accessible to a diverse customer base.\n\n### Recent Developments\n1. **Partnerships**: Remitly has expanded its collaboration with Visa, enabling customers to send funds directly to Visa debit cards and bank accounts in over 100 jurisdictions globally. This partnership aims to streamline cross-border fund flows and enhance financial inclusion for migrant workers [(Gonzalez-Ore, PYMNTS, 2023-11-20)](https://www.pymnts.com/news/cross-border-commerce/cross-border-payments/2023/visa-and-remitly-expand-collaboration-to-digitally-streamline-global-remittance-market/).\n\n2. **Marketing Strategy**: The company has significantly increased its marketing budget, focusing on both performance marketing and brand awareness. In 2023, Remitly's marketing expenses rose by 24%, reflecting its commitment to attracting new customers and retaining existing ones [(Marek, Payments Dive, 2024-01-10)](https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/remitly-international-remittances-advertising-online/704148/).\n\n3. **Global Impact Initiatives**: Remitly's second annual Global Impact Report highlighted its commitment to financial inclusion and community resilience.

He emphasized the importance of building long-term customer trust and the potential for expanding beyond remittances into broader financial services for immigrants [(Remitly Global, Inc, 2024-10-30)](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/10/30/2972046/0/en/Remitly-Reports-Third-Quarter-2024-Results-and-Raises-Full-Year-2024-Outlook.html). Under his leadership, Remitly has positioned itself as a leader in the digital remittance space, with a focus on customer-centric solutions.\n\n## Challenges and Considerations\nDespite its growth, Remitly faces challenges typical of the fintech industry, including competition from established players like Western Union and MoneyGram. The company has also experienced net losses in previous years, although it has shown improvement in its financial metrics recently [(Marek, Payments Dive, 2024-01-10)](https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/remitly-international-remittances-advertising-online/704148/). Additionally, the reliance on marketing to drive customer acquisition raises questions about long-term sustainability and profitability.\n\n## Conclusion\nRemitly is a rapidly growing player in the digital remittance market, with a strong focus on financial inclusion and customer satisfaction. Its recent financial performance indicates a positive trajectory, supported by strategic partnerships and a robust marketing strategy. However, prospective candidates and investors should remain aware of the competitive landscape and the company's ongoing efforts to achieve profitability.\n\nFor further details, please refer to the sources cited throughout this report."
