Occasionally, it goes by the hyphenated name “Guinea-Conakry” to differentiate it from other nearby countries.\n\nAlthough many of Guinea’s neighbors use the West African CFA franc, Guinea has had its own currency since 1959. Before sending money to friends or family in Guinea, let’s brush up on the history of the Guinea franc, including its banknotes and coinage.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Guinea currency, and how to look up the real-time exchange rate using a currency converter.\n\nGuinea currency basics\n\nThe Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea is responsible for issuing the Guinea franc, with seven banknote denominations commonly seen in circulation:\n\n100 francs\n\n500 francs\n\n1,000 francs\n\n2,000 francs\n\n5,000 francs\n\n10,000 francs\n\n20,000 francs\n\nThere are also 25 franc and 50 franc banknotes, but these are less common due to their low value. As for coins, you’ll find 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 franc denominations.\n\nThe design of the Guinea franc changes with every issue, and there have been several commemorative editions to mark occasions like the 50th anniversary of the Guinea franc.\n\nThey all feature the Guinean coat of arms, as well as culturally significant images such as a banana harvest, Mount Nimba, the Kaleta hydroelectric dam, or a bauxite mine.\n\nIf you’re looking to exchange the Guinea franc for a foreign currency, you can use the currency code GNF to look it up on foreign exchange markets.\n\nWithin the country, you may see the abbreviations FG‎, Fr, or GFr to denote Guinean money.\n\nHistory of Guinea’s currency\n\nThe country that’s now Guinea has a shared history with other West African countries, with the Ghana, Mali, and Songhai empires all exerting their influence on the region from as early as the 3rd century.\n\nGold played a major role from the start, both for decorative purposes and as currency in the form of gold dust, wire, and nuggets.\n\nPortuguese traders established ports in the 15th century, and France claimed the territory as part of the French Empire in the late 1800s. The French military called the colony Rivières du Sud, meaning “southern rivers,” before changing the name to French Guinea.\n\nFrance introduced the CFA franc in 1945 to provide a common currency throughout its West and Central African territories, including Guinea. You’ll find other versions of this currency in countries like Senegal and Cameroon.\n\nAfter gaining its independence in 1958, the Republic of Guinea developed its own legal tender, and the first Guinea franc arrived on the scene in 1959.\n\n7 surprising facts about Guinean currency\n\nDue to its geographical location and natural resources, the Republic of Guinea has had a major role in the economy of the region—and an effect on other currencies of the world.\n\nHere are seven surprising facts about Guinea’s currency that you may not know:\n\n1. ‘Guinea’ is also the name of an old English coin.\n\nIf you hear someone mention a “Guinea coin” in a historical context, chances are they aren’t talking about the Guinea franc. The guinea is the name of a gold coin that was first minted in 1663 and used throughout the British Empire until 1814.\n\nSo, why was it called the guinea? They made the coin with gold from the Guinea region, and then it became the name of the coin itself.\n\nAt one point, a guinea was worth 21 shillings or 1.05 pounds. The guinea is no longer legal tender in the United Kingdom, but it was valid until Decimal Day in 1971, when decimalisation changed the way money was represented in the U.K. system.\n\n2. The Republic of Guinea previously used the CFA franc.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1958, Guinea used the French colonial currency, the CFA franc. After the end of the colonial period, the CFA franc evolved into two different currencies: the West African CFA franc and the Central African CFA franc.\n\nThese two currencies have the same value and are interchangeable in all 14 countries that use them. Since they’re pegged to the euro (EUR), they don’t float freely on global currency markets and have a fixed value of €1 to 655.957 CFA francs.\n\nThe Republic of Guinea, however, never joined the currency union that uses the CFA franc. It issues its own currency with its own free-floating exchange rate.\n\n3. There are no centimes in circulation.\n\nLike the CFA francs, one Guinea franc consists of 100 centimes—but you won’t find centimes anywhere in Guinea.\n\nThat’s because the value of the centime is so low that the Central Bank has never issued any denomination smaller than 1 GNF.\n\n4. Guinea briefly switched to the syli in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1971, the country introduced the syli, a currency made up of 100 cauris. Although the Central Bank issued syli coins and banknotes, at 10 francs to 1 syli, they didn’t last long: In 1985, Guinea switched back to the franc, with 1 franc equal to 1 syli.\n\n5. Guinea banknotes use the French language.\n\nIf you look at a Guinea banknote, you’ll notice that most of the writing is in French. For example, 20,000 francs is written as “vingt mille francs guinéens.”\n\nThis is because Guinea was a French territory until 1958. In fact, the official language of the Republic of Guinea is still French.\n\n6. A British printing house designed the early Guinean franc.\n\nDespite getting its name from French currency, several early print runs of the Guinean franc happened in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe iconic De La Rue printing house, which is the largest company of its kind in the world, designed an early set of banknotes.\n\nDe La Rue has worked with at least 140 countries and has designed over one-third of the world’s currency denominations.\n\n7. Guinean banknotes have numerous security features.\n\nIn addition to their beautiful designs, Guinean banknotes contain holographic patches, security strips, and other advanced features to prevent fraud.\n\nOver the years, these have included various watermarks, diamond-shaped patches, and the letters “RG” (Republic of Guinea) to denote their authenticity.\n\nUnderstanding Guinea franc exchange rates\n\nThe Guinea franc is a free-floating currency, which means its value fluctuates compared to other global currencies, such as the U.S. dollar (USD) or the Canadian dollar (CAD).\n\nIn recent years, Guinea’s economy has experienced high inflation—12.60% in 2021—but the country remains a major exporter of gold, bauxite, and other natural resources.\n\nIf you intend to travel to Guinea, you’ll likely want to take cash with you in your local currency and convert it to Guinea francs when you arrive, since ATMs have small withdrawal limits and credit card transactions are rare.\n\nYou can also use a money transfer service to send money to Guinea, with options for receiving funds via a bank deposit, mobile money, or cash pickup.\n\nSend money to Guinea from overseas\n\nWhen you need to send funds to loved ones in Guinea, Remitly makes it easy with a secure mobile app and transparent transaction fees.\n\nYou can send your transfer with a debit card or credit card and track it every step of the way.\n\nDownload the app, and we’ll show you how to get started today.\n\nFurther reading",

They said that they are not allowed to tell me why my account got suspended. I never use credit cards. I’ve only use my checking account to send money and I have spoken many times to different. Agents and they are constantly telling me that they cannot tell me the reason why my account got permanently suspended from the top.

User Beware and don’t repeat my mistake.\n\nHere comes the rant: I send money to my family pretty often, so when I heard of an app that lets me do a direct deposit, I was extremely happy. I use a VPN on my home network so I didn’t even think twice about it becoming a major problem. I sent a small amount for validation purposes and when it was received (!!!) - I proceeded to sending the rest. This is when the fun began. First, I was selected for a “verification” process. Fine, I get it - foreign country, second transaction in the same day - the realities of the world we live in. \n\nI had to call them - honestly I don’t understand why in the current world any of what I had to answer and upload couldn’t have been done interactively via the app, but whatever, it is what it is. \n\nAfter an hour of answering questions and being assured that everything is clear and my recipient will be getting the transfer shortly, I hung up and went back to the app to review the current status. \n\nBLOCKED. \nThey BLOCKER me, after telling me that everything is RESOLVED.\n\nI call again. Another hour of my day wasted, trying to explain to multiple people in a chain as to what happened to finally find out that using a VPN is a problem (again - perfectly fine with that but why did it work the first time? And why did the other rep tell me I’m all set if it was clearly a lie?). Long story short, I’m told that my money will be eventually refunded and a team member will call tomorrow to unlock my account.\n\n…It’s been a month, they are still getting to it I guess. Money did come back a week or so ago after the max pending time was exceeded so I guess I’m grateful for that.\nNeedless to say that even if at some point the company remembers about my existence and calls, I’m not using the service again.",

This is my first time using this. The computer says everything is great, but nothing is good.\nI have talked to the bank my girlfriend and I said money to has talked with the bank. It never went through, but it says it’s there. How could they lie about this? Why would they fraud and then when I asked for the money returned they’re gonna keep pushing forward.\nI have seen on your site numbers to call in case fraud or anything like this happens. We are protective by our government so I will make that call. I will send that letter about this company.\nShould not be allowed for them to do this return the money don’t play the game with your users. \nIt is my money that you were playing with. That’s not fair. You are hurting so many people.\nI’m usually very careful, but I’m going back to MoneyGram.

The problem is very serious delays happen regularly. So you get used to a service which delivers to wallets in seconds or possibly minutes, until suddenly you experience 24 hour delays or more. “Partner bank is experiencing down time”, meanwhile I can send without delays using rival apps - Sendwave works faster 99% of the time. \n\nThe app is used to send money to countries where cash flow is an issue and a 24 hour delay annihilates the very purpose of the app. You’ve raised 300M+, do better. What you guys urgently need to implement is a way to notify customers about possible delays PRIOR to sending, not after sending and only once customer support is contacted.",

I sent a small amount for validation purposes and when it was received (!!!) - I proceeded to sending the rest. This is when the fun began. First, I was selected for a “verification” process. Fine, I get it - foreign country, second transaction in the same day - the realities of the world we live in. \n\nI had to call them - honestly I don’t understand why in the current world any of what I had to answer and upload couldn’t have been done interactively via the app, but whatever, it is what it is. \n\nAfter an hour of answering questions and being assured that everything is clear and my recipient will be getting the transfer shortly, I hung up and went back to the app to review the current status. \n\nBLOCKED. \nThey BLOCKER me, after telling me that everything is RESOLVED.\n\nI call again. Another hour of my day wasted, trying to explain to multiple people in a chain as to what happened to finally find out that using a VPN is a problem (again - perfectly fine with that but why did it work the first time? And why did the other rep tell me I’m all set if it was clearly a lie?). Long story short, I’m told that my money will be eventually refunded and a team member will call tomorrow to unlock my account.\n\n…It’s been a month, they are still getting to it I guess. Money did come back a week or so ago after the max pending time was exceeded so I guess I’m grateful for that.\nNeedless to say that even if at some point the company remembers about my existence and calls, I’m not using the service again.",

I also asked that they refund the late fees incurred because of them and they did(in the form of a credit). I immediately used the credit and vowed not to use their service again.\n\n\n\nEDIT: I submitted complaints via the BBB and CFBP shortly after my original post.\n\nToday 1/12/2023 the status of the transaction magically changed from \"completed\" to on hold.\n\nI called and Remitly couldn't tell me why the transaction was on hold or why they had initially marked it as completed to begin with.\n\nAfter reconfirming that all the information was correct their resolution was to change the \"banking partner\" on the transaction to a different banking partner. I asked who the previous one was and who the new one would be and the rep said he couldn't share that info. Mind you I have been asking about these \"banking partners\" since the beginning because something about the whole thing seems fishy but Remitly won't share who these partners are and what they do exactly.\n\nAnyways instead of doing that I asked to cancel the transaction so I can get a refund. As soon as the money is back in my account I'm resending using my bank's wire transfer and I'm closing the Remitly account for good. I don't need these headaches in my life.\n\nTLDR; I sent a transaction of more than $3,000. Remitly didn't deliver the money but are claiming that they did. Every time I call they tell me they'll escalate the case and conduct an investigation. It's been 2 weeks and they keep telling me the same thing.\n\n\n\nOn 12/28/2023 1 initiated a transfer of $3154.57 from my US account to my international\n\naccount.\n\nOn 1/03/2024 I received a notification that the transfer had been completed. As of 1/10/2024, the money has not been delivered to the account.\n\nI have called Remitly on 8 different occations and have been told different stories about what's going on, including:\n\n* The transaction is complete and I'm incorrect\n* My bank is closed(lt's not)\n* Remitly is conducting an investigation and I'll hear back in 24 hours(l haven't)\n\nI have provived Remitly with copies of my official bank statement that clearly show the money was never received. Depending on who picks up the phone or chat, the Remitly rep states either of the following:\n\n* They spoke with my bank and my bank told them the money was deposited into my\n\naccount\n\n* They are doing an investigation(again)\n\nI have checked with my bank multiple times and they have told m e they have not been contacted by Remitly, and they have no received any funds from them so Remitly is clearly lying and refusing to provide any useful information. I have asked Remitly repeatedly to provide me with the emails they claim to have received from my bank stating the funds were deposited but they can't/won't. I have also asked to speak with the \"internal department\" conducting the investigation but have been told that I can't speak with them and that they will contact me once the investigation is completed.\n\nLast week I was told the investigation would be completed and I would get a resolution today 1/10/2024. When I called today I was told all of the above again and now they are\n\nsupposedly conducting a new investigation...\n\nI just filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau but other than that I don't know what I can do here.

Basically, if your full name and/or other information doesn't closely match, that could be part of the issue. Not saying it is, but very commonly people move and don't promptly update their state id / driver's license, etc. One is supposed to even if they just move down the street. While states generally don't enforce such stuff, it causes problems with automated verification many services use.\n\nIf your full name matches up and not moved at all, then something else triggered the review. Even how you accessed the website, such as through a VPN. Don't know if they have an app, but if using that, maybe had location turned off, which many sites utilize for additional fraud screening.\n\nBBB is a good start. See how that goes, but don't wait too long. If by end of week no progress, file a complaint with CFPB.\n\n## Comment ID khebnja with +1 score by [(Old_Gap_6174, Reddit, 2024-01-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Banking/comments/193cs4k/remitly_just_took_my_3000_dollars_what_can_i_do/khebnja/) (in reply to ID 193cs4k):\nHi u/notdoreen, I'm sorry to hear about the issues you're facing with Remitly.

When I created an account, they did nothing to verify my identity other than confirm my email.  They did nothing to confirm the accuracy or ownership of my bank account used for the transfer.  So security doesn't seem to be their strength.\n\nI also set up a Wise account.  When I wanted to do a transfer, they verify my email, they send 2FA verification codes with every sign-in.  They require more frequent sign-in and more frequent verification codes.  They require a picture of my identification and a selfie of myself.  They verify my ownership of the bank account I use for withdrawals.  Much tighter security.

Thus at some point your email account likely was as well.  However, it did not seem like an email that was a verification, but rather a fait accompli notification.\n\nRather than give Remitly your personal info, since you control the email address for the account, have you considered resetting the password to something ridiculously crazy, such that the scammer could never get back into that account?  Once you did that, and you have control of the account, then maybe you could block any and all emails from remitly(.)com?

I thought these were fake scammer numbers until one day I had enough and made a Remitly account myself. I ended up getting a text from the same number, so I realized these were legitimate texts from Remitly. I called Remitly and they said I had two accounts - which I clearly did not authorize anyone to use my phone number. It could be someone mistakenly using my number but it seems suspicious, since my debit card and people in my family’s debit was hacked a while back. I don’t know how they were even able to add my phone number in the first place, without being able to read my texts, so I’m concerned they might have access to my texts. Should I be concerned? What steps should I take? Thank you.\n\n## Comment ID kzttqub with +3 score by [(HeySoulClassics, Reddit, 2024-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IdentityTheft/comments/1c21ae0/is_someone_using_my_info_to_commit_fraud_remitly/kzttqub/) (in reply to ID 1c21ae0):\nSorry, I don't have an answer for you.

I can see the persons name, address and phone number as well as the phone number for patron they’re attempting to send money to. This is extremely poor security measures for a fintech that must comply with US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Rule 2090. Remitly seems like a disreputable in my eyes company even if they aren’t a scam or fraudulent if they can allow this to occur. Their customer service was little help. They wanted me to verify the birthdate on the account to delete the email from the account. I told them I cannot do this because I didn’t create the account, I’m only receiving the emails. It took me requesting to speak to someone in fraud (through chat) and a total of 45 minutes of my time to get the email removed from the account."

          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "Product/business \r\nCore product is not up to par with competitors. PMs get the blame for this, but 1) leadership is unclear on its priorities 2) Many Engineering teams have been understaffed (1-3 engineers for core parts of the product) for years. Choice to move many Engineering teams to cheaper markets (Poland, elsewhere) has strained communication between Engineering &amp; US-based PMs and the organization has been slow to do anything to respond to complaints about the risk &amp; inefficiency this creates. New initiatives have all fizzled so far (though maybe it’s good that the business is willing to recognize a sunk cost fallacy, at some point). \r\n\r\nData \r\nUnclear what the relationship between Data Engineering/ML Analytics is supposed to be. The leadership of the former does their own thing and only brings in Analytics when their plans are 90% done. No VP+ role in data, no career progression for Data Scientists, roles not aligned to industry standards. Just not a mature organization from a data standpoint. \r\n\r\nCustomer Centricity \r\nIt seems like the business is getting further away from customers, not closer. Passbook (closed neobank initiative) was targeted at Mexican immigrants to the US, but run by an all-white team. North America markets drive the business, but over the past year, now very few people in the Business team have ever lived in North America (no one in leadership; run from London). Understanding of customer needs, lives is super uneven across teams.\r\n\r\n Leadership \r\nAlmost everyone is in their first-ever C-level role. “Stay paranoid” attitude is not playing out in a healthy way. Infighting, scapegoating, excusing bad behavior &amp; mismanagement for favorite directors/VPs is spilling over and corrupting the great culture the company was known for in recent years. \r\n\r\nHR\r\n Chaotic. Rife with personal conflicts, toxic personalities allowed to flourish. Turnover is incredibly high in the recruiting, HR Business Partner, and HR ops groups. HR representatives seem to be lacking in some core training around employee conflict resolution, DEI, even labor laws (some HR reps supervise staff in multiple countries). Tendency is for HR reps to make immediate problems go away for Management at the expense of protecting the company. If you’re Level 4 or below, asking HR for help will probably only make things worse.\r\n\r\n DEI \r\n“Diverse” candidates be warned. The fact that most of the DEI team left this year tells you what you need to know. Smooth-talking men from well-represented backgrounds &amp; elite schools are strongly encouraged to apply. The company has plenty of data on how bad attrition for women, POC, and people who have taken FMLA is at &amp; above Level 3, they just won’t talk about it. Is it worse than other corporations? TBD, but it’s certainly not better. The progress the former DEI team was making stalled out around IPO time. Being in an employee resource group, particularly in leadership, can feel like wearing a “Troublemaker” label. \r\n\r\nGender: Most engineering teams are all men; where there’s a woman on the team, she’s definitely the one being asked to do all of the team lunch reservations. Women can enjoy the comments about how great their smile is, how emotional they are, but how they’re not very strategic in their performance reviews. It's definitely not like this in every team, but these things happen way more often than they should, and employees have no recourse when they do.  Men can get satisfactory performance reviews for shipping nothing, so long as their boss likes them. Underperforming men leave when they get new external jobs. High-performing women get assigned additional tasks like mentoring, recruiting, cultural centricity promotion, &amp; emotional labor-type work that the company will never reward, and then be told they did not drive enough business value at their next review. The departure rate for women at L3 and above (across functions) has visibly accelerated since Q4 2022. Multiple well-respected women who have complained about gender bias issues in the past year have mysteriously had their roles eliminated. \r\n\r\nRace: Management has expressed skepticism that ‘diverse’ teams can actually “perform” to managers that make an effort to make the company more representative of the customer base (immigrants). Only a few VP+ leaders are past the ‘I don’t see race and gender’ and ‘I have a black friend/I have a daughter’ level on their DEI learning. \r\n\r\nFMLA &amp; Disability, new parents: As another review said, if you need disability accommodations, good luck. Nursing mothers pressured to do non-essential travel, managers told that covid illnesses are not an acceptable reason to push back non-business-critical work. New mothers have had it made clear to them that having a baby and taking leave is the reason they weren’t promoted.",

        "advice": "COO’s goodwill tour is well-intended, but not working.\r\n Analytics / Analytics Engineering / Data Engineering functions &amp; tools are not well aligned to the market; lack of a VP+ leader in this space means that no one is representing these interests at the executive level. \r\nYou can’t fix the product or the cultural decay if you don’t fix the issues at the top. \r\nIt’s a public company now, we need to hold a higher bar than this for our managers and leaders.",
        "cons": "Product/business \r\nCore product is not up to par with competitors. PMs get the blame for this, but 1) leadership is unclear on its priorities 2) Many Engineering teams have been understaffed (1-3 engineers for core parts of the product) for years. Choice to move many Engineering teams to cheaper markets (Poland, elsewhere) has strained communication between Engineering &amp; US-based PMs and the organization has been slow to do anything to respond to complaints about the risk &amp; inefficiency this creates. New initiatives have all fizzled so far (though maybe it’s good that the business is willing to recognize a sunk cost fallacy, at some point). \r\n\r\nData \r\nUnclear what the relationship between Data Engineering/ML Analytics is supposed to be. The leadership of the former does their own thing and only brings in Analytics when their plans are 90% done. No VP+ role in data, no career progression for Data Scientists, roles not aligned to industry standards. Just not a mature organization from a data standpoint. \r\n\r\nCustomer Centricity \r\nIt seems like the business is getting further away from customers, not closer. Passbook (closed neobank initiative) was targeted at Mexican immigrants to the US, but run by an all-white team. North America markets drive the business, but over the past year, now very few people in the Business team have ever lived in North America (no one in leadership; run from London). Understanding of customer needs, lives is super uneven across teams.\r\n\r\n Leadership \r\nAlmost everyone is in their first-ever C-level role. “Stay paranoid” attitude is not playing out in a healthy way. Infighting, scapegoating, excusing bad behavior &amp; mismanagement for favorite directors/VPs is spilling over and corrupting the great culture the company was known for in recent years. \r\n\r\nHR\r\n Chaotic. Rife with personal conflicts, toxic personalities allowed to flourish. Turnover is incredibly high in the recruiting, HR Business Partner, and HR ops groups. HR representatives seem to be lacking in some core training around employee conflict resolution, DEI, even labor laws (some HR reps supervise staff in multiple countries). Tendency is for HR reps to make immediate problems go away for Management at the expense of protecting the company. If you’re Level 4 or below, asking HR for help will probably only make things worse.\r\n\r\n DEI \r\n“Diverse” candidates be warned. The fact that most of the DEI team left this year tells you what you need to know. Smooth-talking men from well-represented backgrounds &amp; elite schools are strongly encouraged to apply. The company has plenty of data on how bad attrition for women, POC, and people who have taken FMLA is at &amp; above Level 3, they just won’t talk about it. Is it worse than other corporations? TBD, but it’s certainly not better. The progress the former DEI team was making stalled out around IPO time. Being in an employee resource group, particularly in leadership, can feel like wearing a “Troublemaker” label. \r\n\r\nGender: Most engineering teams are all men; where there’s a woman on the team, she’s definitely the one being asked to do all of the team lunch reservations. Women can enjoy the comments about how great their smile is, how emotional they are, but how they’re not very strategic in their performance reviews. It's definitely not like this in every team, but these things happen way more often than they should, and employees have no recourse when they do.  Men can get satisfactory performance reviews for shipping nothing, so long as their boss likes them. Underperforming men leave when they get new external jobs. High-performing women get assigned additional tasks like mentoring, recruiting, cultural centricity promotion, &amp; emotional labor-type work that the company will never reward, and then be told they did not drive enough business value at their next review. The departure rate for women at L3 and above (across functions) has visibly accelerated since Q4 2022. Multiple well-respected women who have complained about gender bias issues in the past year have mysteriously had their roles eliminated. \r\n\r\nRace: Management has expressed skepticism that ‘diverse’ teams can actually “perform” to managers that make an effort to make the company more representative of the customer base (immigrants). Only a few VP+ leaders are past the ‘I don’t see race and gender’ and ‘I have a black friend/I have a daughter’ level on their DEI learning. \r\n\r\nFMLA &amp; Disability, new parents: As another review said, if you need disability accommodations, good luck. Nursing mothers pressured to do non-essential travel, managers told that covid illnesses are not an acceptable reason to push back non-business-critical work. New mothers have had it made clear to them that having a baby and taking leave is the reason they weren’t promoted.",

If the company doesn’t totally screw it up, they’ll continue to be able to ride the tailwinds from that \r\nWork mode \r\nSome fully remote and many hybrid teams and enough people around to have office culture for those who do go in, but it seems like that may be on the way out. Get a clear commitment from your hiring manager if you want remote or hybrid long-term \r\nData\r\n Altogether pretty clean and easy to work with, though there are big gaps on the product side\r\n\r\n People\r\n The golden age is over, but the company is still able to hire some pretty good resumes, and Seattle office probably still has a much lower jerk quotient than some other notable tech companies in the city (not sure this is stable though).  A lot of people really do want to do right by their colleagues, but more and more, incentives don't encourage that. Marketing team is very distributed (remote) and more diverse than the rest of the company. There are still a couple of leaders who are well-loved by their teams.",

      "# [Remitly taps ads to woo new clients by Lynne Marek on 2024-01-10](https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/remitly-international-remittances-advertising-online/704148/)\nDive Brief:\n\nCross-border payments company Remitly boosted its advertising budget last year with a two-fold goal: to build its brand and attract new customers, CEO Matt Oppenheimer said in an interview.\n\nSeattle-based Remitly increased online ads, posted on social media sites such as Facebook and YouTube, to drive measurable customer acquisition, what it calls “performance marketing.” It also advertised in places like airports, to build brand awareness more broadly. Most of the ads are for performance marketing.\n\n“We’re doing very targeted brand marketing to, again, kind of water that tree to grow that fruit to make our performance marketing even more effective,” Oppenheimer said in an interview last week.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWith the increased marketing, Remitly has sought to expand its client set. That’s more the goal than increasing use of its services by existing customers, Oppenheimer said. For most of Remitly’s customers, the payments they’re sending, often to friends and family, are for non-discretionary needs like “basic living expenses, for emergency medical expenses, for college tuition,” he said.\n\nRemitly’s marketing expense, which includes advertising, rose 24% for the first nine months of last year, over 2022, to $159 million, as revenue jumped 47% for the nine-month period to nearly $680 million, according to the company’s most recently filed quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nonetheless, the company hasn’t been profitable, posting losses for the nine-month periods in both years, the filing said.\n\n“We understand performance-based marketing should have relatively short payback periods (measured by new users) while the benefits from brand marketing are typically realized over time,” analysts at the financial firm William Blair said in a Jan. 2 note to clients.\n\nAside from attracting customers, Remitly may draw potential acquirers too, according to the William Blair report. The financial firm included Remitly on a list of companies that may be attractive acquisitions because their stock prices have declined over the past year. A spokesperson for Remitly declined to comment on that possibility.\n\nOppenheimer sees plenty of room for growth, with the company having penetrated only 2% of the market, he estimates.\n\nRemitly in November extended a partnership with Visa after first partnering with the card network giant in 2019. In 2021, it also won investment backing from Visa and sold shares in an initial public offering that same year. Nonetheless, it has also retrenched in some areas too, pulling back on a digital bank account service called Passbook last year.\n\nRemitly aims to attract those remittance users who may have become dissatisfied, for whatever reason, with rival services, offered by competitors that include MoneyGram and Western Union. When consumers go online looking for alternatives, Oppenheimer expects his company’s ads may catch the consumer’s eye.\n\nThe bulk of remittance services are still handled offline, by small convenience stores in the U.S. as well as similar style bodegas in other countries. That’s because customers must have a high degree of trust in the outlets they’re working with, given the personal information provided and the transfer of money, Oppenheimer said.\n\nRecent global economic trouble doesn’t bother Oppenheimer because his remittance customers tend to be very “resilient,” with a need to send money to other places regardless of financial challenges, he said. “There’s a predictability and a priority and a resilience of our customers,” the CEO said.",

Tapping into the power of the Mastercard network, Remitly will integrate Mastercard’s Send and Cross-Border Services to offer its customers more choice in how they securely send money to family and loved ones abroad via the Remitly app.\n\nConvenient and secure access to remittances serves as a lifeline for many. According to Mastercard’s upcoming 2023 Borderless Payments Report, 41 percent of consumers who have made cross-border payments in the last 12 months intend to increase the frequency of their cross-border transactions over the next year to provide critical financial support for family and friends overseas. Further, in a November 2022 survey of approximately 2,000 remittance senders conducted by Remitly, 34 percent of respondents said that money sent home is the primary source of income for their recipient’s household. Remitly and Mastercard are committed to improving the transparency, convenience, and speed of delivering these critical funds to Remitly’s customers’ families and loved ones.\n\n\"Remitly is committed to transforming the way money moves internationally so that our customers can send money with complete confidence and peace of mind,\" said Matt Oppenheimer, Co-founder & CEO of Remitly. \"Our partnership with Mastercard demonstrates continued progress toward this monumental goal, adding breadth and depth to our robust payments network, so more customers around the world can access the trusted cross border payments they need to support their loved ones back home.\"\n\nTogether, Mastercard and Remitly are making it more convenient to send money abroad. Backed by the speed, reach, and trust of the Mastercard network, Mastercard Send enables U.S.-based Remitly customers to fund transactions via their debit card. Remitly has also integrated Mastercard Cross-Border Services to offer customers more choice in how recipients can access their funds through a variety of disbursement options within Mastercard’s global network, such as bank accounts, cash pick-up locations, and mobile wallets.\n\n“Having grown up in Mexico, I know first-hand how vital it is to quickly and securely send and access funds abroad to support critical everyday expenses,” said Silvana Hernandez, Executive Vice President, Product and Engineering, North America, Mastercard. “Our collaboration provides Remitly users with an added layer of convenience and peace of mind, ensuring that funds get into the right hands when they need it most.”\n\nTogether, Mastercard and Remitly are providing convenience and optionality for each step in the remittance journey.",

(NASDAQ: RELY), a trusted provider of digital financial services that transcend borders, reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n“We are pleased with our second quarter performance as our product experience delights both new and existing customers,” said Matt Oppenheimer, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Remitly. “Our differentiated positioning, focus on building long-term customer trust, and our increasing global scale enabled these strong results. Looking ahead, we are pleased to raise our 2024 outlook for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.”\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Highlights and Key Operating Data\n\n(All comparisons relative to the second quarter of 2023)\n\nActive customers increased to 6.9 million, from 5.0 million, up 36%.\n\nSend volume increased to $13.2 billion, from $9.6 billion, up 38%.\n\nRevenue totaled $306.4 million, compared to $234.0 million, up 31%.\n\nNet loss was $12.1 million, compared to $18.9 million, an improvement of 36%.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $25.1 million, compared to $20.4 million, up 23%.\n\n2024 Financial Outlook\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, Remitly currently expects:\n\nTotal revenue in the range of $1,230 million to $1,250 million, representing a growth rate of 30% to 32% year over year. This outlook reflects an increase at the midpoint from our prior revenue outlook in the range of $1,225 million to $1,250 million.\n\nTo remain in a GAAP net loss position for 2024 and for Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. This outlook reflects an increase from our prior Adjusted EBITDA outlook in the range of $85 million and $95 million.\n\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this earnings release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” We have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of forecasted Adjusted EBITDA to forecasted GAAP net income (loss) or to forecasted GAAP income (loss) before income taxes within this earnings release because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, calculate certain reconciling items with confidence due to the variability, complexity, and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from forecasted Adjusted EBITDA. These items include, but are not limited to, income taxes and stock-based compensation expense, which are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. The variability of these items could have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\nNote: All percentage changes described within this press release are calculated using amounts in the Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), for which revenue and active customers are presented in thousands and send volume is presented in millions. Rounding differences may occur when individually calculating percentages or totals from rounded amounts included within the press release body as compared to the amounts included within the Company’s SEC filings.\n\nWebcast Information\n\nRemitly will host a webcast at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, July 31, 2024 to discuss its second quarter 2024 financial results. The live webcast and investor presentation will be accessible on Remitly’s website at https://ir.remitly.com. A webcast replay will be available on our website at https://ir.remitly.com following the live event.\n\nWe have used, and intend to continue to use, the Investor Relations section of our website at https://ir.remitly.com as a means of disclosing material nonpublic information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nSome of the financial information and data contained in this earnings release, such as Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expenses, have not been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\n\nWe regularly review our key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our performance, identify trends affecting our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information for management and investors in assessing our historical and future operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expenses are key output measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance, inform future operating plans, and make strategic long-term decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources. Remitly believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expenses provides additional tools to assess operational performance and trends in, and in comparing Remitly’s financial measures with, other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Remitly’s non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Because of the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures, you should consider the non-GAAP financial measures presented herein in conjunction with Remitly’s financial statements and the related notes thereto. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in this press release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted by (i) interest (income) expense, net, (ii) provision for income taxes, (iii) noncash charges of depreciation and amortization, (iv) gains and losses from the remeasurement of foreign currency assets and liabilities into their functional currency, (v) noncash charges associated with our donation of common stock in connection with our Pledge 1% commitment, (vi) noncash stock-based compensation expense, net, and (vii) certain acquisition, integration, restructuring, and other costs. We calculate non-GAAP operating expenses as our GAAP operating expenses adjusted by (i) noncash stock-based compensation expense, net, (ii) noncash charges associated with our donation of common stock in connection with our Pledge 1% commitment, as well as (iii) certain acquisition, integration, restructuring, and other costs.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

      "# [Visa and Remitly Expand Collaboration to Digitally Streamline Global Remittance Market by PYMNTS, www.facebook.com on 2023-11-20](https://www.pymnts.com/news/cross-border-commerce/cross-border-payments/2023/visa-and-remitly-expand-collaboration-to-digitally-streamline-global-remittance-market/)\nYanilsa Gonzalez-Ore, North America Head of Visa Direct and Global Ecosystem Readiness, and Remitly’s CEO Matt Oppenheimer told PYMNTS cross-border money transfers are ripe for app-driven, digital modernization.\n\n“Global money movement has not yet evolved to the levels expected and needed by the world,” said Gonzalez-Ore, who added that speed, cost and transparency continue to be cross-border pain points. Real-time and digital-first solutions are among the best ways to address those pain points and alleviate frictions, she said.\n\nMonday (Nov 20), Remitly and Visa said they had expanded their collaboration, first detailed in May 2021, that seeks to streamline cross-border fund flows.\n\nOppenheimer and Gonzalez-Ore noted that the expanded efforts enable Remitly customers in more than 15 countries, including the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Australia, to push funds directly to holders’ Visa debit cards and bank accounts in more than 100 jurisdictions globally. The transfers can be tracked directly through the Remitly app.\n\nTaking Note of the Digital Shift\n\nOppenheimer said that the expansion takes into account the “structural shift” that’s been gaining momentum since the Visa/Remitly collaboration was announced initially, where, traditionally, most remittance activity began and ended at a physical location (such as at remittance agents). The pandemic, of course, moved more individuals to embrace digital options to move funds, using their devices as digitally-enabled endpoints to facilitate push-to-card transactions.\n\nIn terms of the mechanics of the transactions themselves, senders enter a recipient’s name and 16-digit Visa debit card number into the Remitly app in order to send funds to Visa debit cards and to recipients’ bank accounts. At a high level, said Oppenheimer, the move helps bolster Remitly’s bid to expand its network “for customers to send money to 4 billion bank accounts, 1.2 billion mobile wallets and more than 460,000 cash pickup locations.”\n\nFor Visa, said Gonzalez-Ore, the expansion broadens financial inclusion for millions of migrant workers sending money to loved ones globally.\n\nAsked by PYMNTS for an illustrative use case, Oppenheimer offered that 80% of remittance transfers support households’ needs and medical expenses. Funds sent to pay for an individual’s emergency surgery, he said, “are critical. They’re a lifeline,” and speed, reliability and transparency are critical, too.\n\n“Someone who’s sending money home for their child,” he told PYMNTS, “cannot afford for that transaction to be delayed.” Partnering with Visa, he added, enables the funds to be collected and disbursed securely.\n\nEarly Innings, Still\n\nIt’s still early innings in the digital shift that is helping transform remittances, said Oppenheimer, who added that Remitly has only about 2%+ share of the $1.6 trillion in remittances that cross borders each year. The opportunity is there, noted Oppenheimer, to expand beyond remittances and craft financial services ecosystems for immigrants and their families.\n\nAdded Gonzalez-Ore, P2P payments serve as “tip of the spear for a change in money movement.” Consumers have gotten used to the convenience and speed that they’ve enjoyed as part of everyday domestic transactions. They’ll expect the same in cross-border interactions — and remittances, after all, are a form of international P2P payments. We’re headed toward a future where cross-border payroll and other use cases build on the interactions forged through the collaborations between Visa and Remitly.\n\nAs Gonzalez-Ore told PYMNTS, “this is an example of how different players in the ecosystem can come together to change the way things operate today and help evolve money movement…it’s an alignment of goals and we are excited for it to continue for the longer term.”",
