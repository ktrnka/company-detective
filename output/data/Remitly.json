      "# [7 Surprising Facts You Need to Know About Guinea’s Currency by Growth Machine on 2024-07-22](https://blog.remitly.com/currencies/guinea-currency/)\nThe Guinean franc (GNF) is the official currency of the Republic of Guinea, a country in West Africa in the Guinea geographical region. Occasionally, it goes by the hyphenated name “Guinea-Conakry” to differentiate it from other nearby countries.\n\nAlthough many of Guinea’s neighbors use the West African CFA franc, Guinea has had its own currency since 1959. Before sending money to friends or family in Guinea, let’s brush up on the history of the Guinea franc, including its banknotes and coinage.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Guinea currency, and how to look up the real-time exchange rate using a currency converter.\n\nGuinea currency basics\n\nThe Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea is responsible for issuing the Guinea franc, with seven banknote denominations commonly seen in circulation:\n\n100 francs\n\n500 francs\n\n1,000 francs\n\n2,000 francs\n\n5,000 francs\n\n10,000 francs\n\n20,000 francs\n\nThere are also 25 franc and 50 franc banknotes, but these are less common due to their low value. As for coins, you’ll find 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 franc denominations.\n\nThe design of the Guinea franc changes with every issue, and there have been several commemorative editions to mark occasions like the 50th anniversary of the Guinea franc.\n\nThey all feature the Guinean coat of arms, as well as culturally significant images such as a banana harvest, Mount Nimba, the Kaleta hydroelectric dam, or a bauxite mine.\n\nIf you’re looking to exchange the Guinea franc for a foreign currency, you can use the currency code GNF to look it up on foreign exchange markets.\n\nWithin the country, you may see the abbreviations FG‎, Fr, or GFr to denote Guinean money.\n\nHistory of Guinea’s currency\n\nThe country that’s now Guinea has a shared history with other West African countries, with the Ghana, Mali, and Songhai empires all exerting their influence on the region from as early as the 3rd century.\n\nGold played a major role from the start, both for decorative purposes and as currency in the form of gold dust, wire, and nuggets.\n\nPortuguese traders established ports in the 15th century, and France claimed the territory as part of the French Empire in the late 1800s. The French military called the colony Rivières du Sud, meaning “southern rivers,” before changing the name to French Guinea.\n\nFrance introduced the CFA franc in 1945 to provide a common currency throughout its West and Central African territories, including Guinea. You’ll find other versions of this currency in countries like Senegal and Cameroon.\n\nAfter gaining its independence in 1958, the Republic of Guinea developed its own legal tender, and the first Guinea franc arrived on the scene in 1959.\n\n7 surprising facts about Guinean currency\n\nDue to its geographical location and natural resources, the Republic of Guinea has had a major role in the economy of the region—and an effect on other currencies of the world.\n\nHere are seven surprising facts about Guinea’s currency that you may not know:\n\n1. ‘Guinea’ is also the name of an old English coin.\n\nIf you hear someone mention a “Guinea coin” in a historical context, chances are they aren’t talking about the Guinea franc. The guinea is the name of a gold coin that was first minted in 1663 and used throughout the British Empire until 1814.\n\nSo, why was it called the guinea? They made the coin with gold from the Guinea region, and then it became the name of the coin itself.\n\nAt one point, a guinea was worth 21 shillings or 1.05 pounds. The guinea is no longer legal tender in the United Kingdom, but it was valid until Decimal Day in 1971, when decimalisation changed the way money was represented in the U.K. system.\n\n2. The Republic of Guinea previously used the CFA franc.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1958, Guinea used the French colonial currency, the CFA franc. After the end of the colonial period, the CFA franc evolved into two different currencies: the West African CFA franc and the Central African CFA franc.\n\nThese two currencies have the same value and are interchangeable in all 14 countries that use them. Since they’re pegged to the euro (EUR), they don’t float freely on global currency markets and have a fixed value of €1 to 655.957 CFA francs.\n\nThe Republic of Guinea, however, never joined the currency union that uses the CFA franc. It issues its own currency with its own free-floating exchange rate.\n\n3. There are no centimes in circulation.\n\nLike the CFA francs, one Guinea franc consists of 100 centimes—but you won’t find centimes anywhere in Guinea.\n\nThat’s because the value of the centime is so low that the Central Bank has never issued any denomination smaller than 1 GNF.\n\n4. Guinea briefly switched to the syli in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1971, the country introduced the syli, a currency made up of 100 cauris. Although the Central Bank issued syli coins and banknotes, at 10 francs to 1 syli, they didn’t last long: In 1985, Guinea switched back to the franc, with 1 franc equal to 1 syli.\n\n5. Guinea banknotes use the French language.\n\nIf you look at a Guinea banknote, you’ll notice that most of the writing is in French. For example, 20,000 francs is written as “vingt mille francs guinéens.”\n\nThis is because Guinea was a French territory until 1958. In fact, the official language of the Republic of Guinea is still French.\n\n6. A British printing house designed the early Guinean franc.\n\nDespite getting its name from French currency, several early print runs of the Guinean franc happened in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe iconic De La Rue printing house, which is the largest company of its kind in the world, designed an early set of banknotes.\n\nDe La Rue has worked with at least 140 countries and has designed over one-third of the world’s currency denominations.\n\n7. Guinean banknotes have numerous security features.\n\nIn addition to their beautiful designs, Guinean banknotes contain holographic patches, security strips, and other advanced features to prevent fraud.\n\nOver the years, these have included various watermarks, diamond-shaped patches, and the letters “RG” (Republic of Guinea) to denote their authenticity.\n\nUnderstanding Guinea franc exchange rates\n\nThe Guinea franc is a free-floating currency, which means its value fluctuates compared to other global currencies, such as the U.S. dollar (USD) or the Canadian dollar (CAD).\n\nIn recent years, Guinea’s economy has experienced high inflation—12.60% in 2021—but the country remains a major exporter of gold, bauxite, and other natural resources.\n\nIf you intend to travel to Guinea, you’ll likely want to take cash with you in your local currency and convert it to Guinea francs when you arrive, since ATMs have small withdrawal limits and credit card transactions are rare.\n\nYou can also use a money transfer service to send money to Guinea, with options for receiving funds via a bank deposit, mobile money, or cash pickup.\n\nSend money to Guinea from overseas\n\nWhen you need to send funds to loved ones in Guinea, Remitly makes it easy with a secure mobile app and transparent transaction fees.\n\nYou can send your transfer with a debit card or credit card and track it every step of the way.\n\nDownload the app, and we’ll show you how to get started today.\n\nFurther reading",
      "# [5 Facts about the Cambodian Riel That You May Not Know by Evelyne Kuo on 2023-11-01](https://blog.remitly.com/currencies/cambodian-riel/)\nAre you traveling to Cambodia or sending money home? You might need to turn your USD, euros, pounds, or other currency into Cambodian riel.\n\nAre you only looking for the current riel to dollar (or dollar to riel) exchange rate? Here’s today’s rate with Remitly.\n\nLearn more about Cambodian riel rates, facts, and tips in this guide—whether you send money to Southeast Asia or plan to visit soon.\n\nThe overview of Cambodian riel\n\nThe official currency of Cambodia is the Cambodian riel, and its currency code is KHR (៛). Its sub-units are the sen (one-hundredth of a riel) and the kak (one-tenth of a riel). The coins in circulation are in the following denominations:\n\n50 riels, 100 riels\n\n200 riels\n\n500 riels\n\nAlso in circulation are banknotes of:\n\n50 riels\n\n100 riels\n\n500 riels\n\n1,000 riels\n\n2,000 riels\n\n5,000 riels\n\n10,000 riels\n\n15,000 riels\n\n20,000 riels\n\n50,000 riels\n\n5 facts about the Cambodian riel\n\n1. Riel notes showcase Cambodia’s rich history.\n\nFrom the smallest bill to the largest, each Cambodian riel note showcases a different Cambodian landmark or cultural icon. Many notes feature Cambodian cultural and historical sites and architecture on one side and a cultural icon or member of the royal family on the other.\n\nThe smallest note (50 riels) features the temple Banteay Srei on one side and the Gate of Tek Thla on the other.\n\nThe largest note (50,000 riels) features King Norodom Sihanouk on one side and the Bakong Temple on the other.\n\nThe 20,000 riel note features one of Cambodia’s most popular landmarks, Angkor Wat.\n\n2. There have been two different currencies used in Cambodia.\n\nWhile the riel is the official currency of Cambodia, there have been two distinct riels in the country since independence from France.\n\nThe first riel was issued between 1953 and May 1975.\n\nThe country had no monetary system during the period of political and social strife of the Cambodian Civil War and the Khmer Rouge regime, from 1975 to 1980.\n\nThe second, and current, riel has been in the issue since March 1980. Since the 1990s, Cambodians have used the riel alongside the U.S. dollar.\n\n3. Cambodians usually don’t use coins.\n\nCambodia’s rich history also extends to its historical use of coins. Once prized for their artistry, craftsmanship, and use of precious materials, the modern Cambodian economy is primarily based on banknotes. While coins are still in circulation, they are rarely used. Instead, most of the currency is printed on bills.\n\nAfter years of civil war and the abolishment of money during the Khmer Rouge regime, Cambodia’s economy could no longer support coins as currency and people lost the habit of using them.\n\n4. The U.S. dollar is common and in circulation in Cambodia.\n\nWhile the official currency of Cambodia is the riel (KHR), the country also widely uses the U.S. dollar. So much so, in fact, that many of the country’s ATM machines allow for withdrawals in USD. Experts estimate that the dollar accounts for 83% of the total transactions and more than 90% of banking deposits.\n\nForeign currency is more commonly used in transactions in tourist and urban areas. Businesses are likely to list prices in USD. In rural areas, where the use of riel is more common, it might be hard to break a $20 bill.\n\nCambodian ATMs dispense both USD and Cambodian riels, but foreign travelers may only be able to draw from their foreign accounts in USD. Double-check before you travel to Cambodia.\n\n5. The riel has a relatively fixed USD exchange rate.\n\nThe reintroduction of the riel in 1980 saw a fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar, setting the value at 4 riels to $1. Since then, the relative values of the two currencies have diverged. The KHR is a free-floating currency but has lost a large degree of value against other major currencies in recent decades. While the official exchange rate may change, it is common now to see exchange rates of 4,000 KHR to 1 USD when buying products from small vendors.\n\nMore about Cambodia\n\nCambodia is a country in Southeast Asia bordering Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam. The country is largely rural (with over 75% of the population living in rural areas), but the influences of many Asian cultures alongside those of France and the United States can be seen throughout the country and its capital, Phnom Penh.\n\nFor 2,000 years, Cambodia’s civilization absorbed influences from India and China due to trade on the Mekong, transferring them to other Southeast Asian civilizations in the process. The country is now known for its massive temple complexes built during the Khmer empire (12th century), such as Angkor Wat and Kayon.\n\nCambodia became a French colony in 1863 and experienced upheaval and turmoil in the 20th century as a result of Japanese occupation during World War II, post-war independence, and political instability.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1979, the country was devastated by the reign of the Khmer Rouge.

      "# [5 Fascinating Facts about the Colombian Peso by Evelyne Kuo on 2023-11-01](https://blog.remitly.com/currencies/colombian-peso/)\nColombia is a beautiful, diverse country with mountain landscapes, Caribbean beaches, and a rich cultural heritage. From coffee production to influential music, Colombia continues to have an outsized impact on today’s world. Just watch Disney’s Colombia-based Encanto or listen to any Shakira album, and you’ll understand. But what about Colombia’s money? An important aspect of any country’s history is its currency. In Colombia, that’s the Colombian peso.\n\nWhether you’re looking to visit Colombia or send money home, you’ll want to know more about Colombia’s currency. Read on for the basics, the history, and a few fascinating facts about the Colombian Peso.\n\nColombia’s currency code is COP and the major issuing bank is the Central Bank of Colombia, or the Banco de la República. This currency comes in the form of bills and coins and is symbolized with a dollar sign, like this: $.\n\nA Brief History of the Colombian Peso\n\nThe currency of Colombia has undergone numerous changes since its inception in the 1800s. Like many other Spanish colonies, Colombia instituted its own monetary system after overthrowing colonial rule.\n\nColombian pesos in the 19th Century\n\nIn 1810, Colombia switched from the Spanish real to the peso.\n\nColombians also used gold and silver coins as currency.\n\nColombian pesos in the 20th Century\n\nIn 1984, Colombia stopped minting peso coins (centavos) under the amount of 1 peso.\n\nThe smallest minted coin amount is 50 pesos.\n\nPesos could be converted into gold until 1931.\n\n5 Facts about the Colombian Peso\n\nColombian pesos are as colorful as their culture.\n\n1. Many bills feature leaders in the Colombian arts (and more).\n\n1,000 pesos – leader of the Socialist movement and presidential candidate Jorge Eliécer Gaitán\n\n2,000 – renowned artist Débora Arango\n\n5,000 – poet José Asunción Silva\n\n10,000 – notable anthropologist Virginia Gutiérrez\n\n20,000 – The 24th Colombian president, Alfonso López Michelsen\n\n50,000 – Nobel-prize winning author Gabriel García Márquez\n\n100,000 – The 22nd Colombian president, Carlos Lleras Restrepo\n\n2. Two different peso designs are in use today.\n\nIf you find yourself in Colombia, you might see slight differences among the bills.\n\nWhen the national bank started creating pesos with larger denominations, they changed the visuals on the bills. The original printed design read “50,000” in numerals. Newer peso banknotes display “50 thousand” instead.\n\n3. You may get VAT refunds if you spend Colombian pesos.\n\nIf you’re visiting Colombia, you might be eligible for a VAT refund when you spend money there. Wondering what this means? A VAT refund returns some tax money paid by non-residents for certain goods.\n\nIn Colombia, these goods include:\n\nLocal crafts\n\nToys\n\nLinens\n\nHousehold appliances\n\nFootwear\n\nLeather goods\n\nJewelry\n\nYou can pursue this process at the DIAN (National Tax and Customs Department). You’ll need to fill out an application along with other paperwork. Just make sure that you have your passport and receipt for the goods that you’ve bought with Colombian pesos.\n\n4. One edition of the $50,000 peso is vertical.\n\nA unique feature of the older $50,000 peso is that its imagery is vertical. Jorge Isaacs is featured on this bill. Isaacs is a famous Colombian writer best known for his work María.\n\nThis is not only different from the rest of the Colombian peso banknotes, but it is different from most global currencies. Most bills across the world have the picture printed horizontally.\n\nThe 50,000 peso banknote has since been updated as of 2016 with a horizontal image of the writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez.\n\n5. Special features prevent the spread of counterfeit money.\n\nThe citizens of Colombia voiced concerns about the rise of counterfeit money, so the Banco de la República issued a statement emphasizing the unique security features Colombian pesos have to prevent this from happening. These features include:\n\nSecurity thread\n\nWatermark\n\nMatching images\n\nColor-shifting images with motion effects\n\nUnderstanding Colombian Currency Exchange Rates\n\nExchange rates vary due to political and economic factors. A quick online search will lead you to easy currency converter tools to check today’s rate. Common COP rate searches include those for converting the peso to the American dollar (USD), the Canadian dollar (CAD), the euro (EUR), the Australian dollar (AUD), the British pound (GBP), the Swiss franc, and the Chinese yuan.\n\nCheck the current rates with Remitly in our app or on our website.\n\nWhile exchange rates vary, as mentioned, you can get a feel for what to expect by checking historical rates. Foreign exchange sites like Oanda or FXTOP offer charts that make these calculations easy.\n\nFor instance, FXTOP shows that the average exchange rate for USD to COP from December 10, 2018 to December 10, 2021 has been 3,561.1 pesos to one U.S. dollar.\n\nIf you want to know more, browse our guide to the getting the best Colombian peso rates.\n\nSending Money to Colombia\n\nSending money to Colombia is a fairly simple process when you use the right service. With money transfer apps like Remitly, you can easily send funds to family and friends in Colombia. You can also send money to yourself.\n\nHave a look at our website or download the app, and we’ll walk you through how to send money to Colombia.\n\nMore about Money in Colombia\n\nYou’ll find that in major cities and tourist hotspots in Colombia, you can get away with using cash or credit and debit cards. ATMs are also widely available and often have better rates than those you’ll get at an airport exchange counter. These cities include:\n\nBogotá\n\nSanta Marta\n\nBarranquilla\n\nCali\n\nMedellín\n\nCartagena\n\nSan Andrés\n\nPereira\n\nBucaramanga\n\nColombian pesos in the form of cash might be the only form of payment in more rural areas in Colombia. The U.S. dollar may also be accepted, even though it’s not an official currency there."

I immediately used the credit and vowed not to use their service again.\n\n\n\nEDIT: I submitted complaints via the BBB and CFBP shortly after my original post.\n\nToday 1/12/2023 the status of the transaction magically changed from \"completed\" to on hold.\n\nI called and Remitly couldn't tell me why the transaction was on hold or why they had initially marked it as completed to begin with.\n\nAfter reconfirming that all the information was correct their resolution was to change the \"banking partner\" on the transaction to a different banking partner. I asked who the previous one was and who the new one would be and the rep said he couldn't share that info. Mind you I have been asking about these \"banking partners\" since the beginning because something about the whole thing seems fishy but Remitly won't share who these partners are and what they do exactly.\n\nAnyways instead of doing that I asked to cancel the transaction so I can get a refund. As soon as the money is back in my account I'm resending using my bank's wire transfer and I'm closing the Remitly account for good. I don't need these headaches in my life.\n\nTLDR; I sent a transaction of more than $3,000. Remitly didn't deliver the money but are claiming that they did. Every time I call they tell me they'll escalate the case and conduct an investigation. It's been 2 weeks and they keep telling me the same thing.\n\n\n\nOn 12/28/2023 1 initiated a transfer of $3154.57 from my US account to my international\n\naccount.\n\nOn 1/03/2024 I received a notification that the transfer had been completed. As of 1/10/2024, the money has not been delivered to the account.\n\nI have called Remitly on 8 different occations and have been told different stories about what's going on, including:\n\n* The transaction is complete and I'm incorrect\n* My bank is closed(lt's not)\n* Remitly is conducting an investigation and I'll hear back in 24 hours(l haven't)\n\nI have provived Remitly with copies of my official bank statement that clearly show the money was never received. Depending on who picks up the phone or chat, the Remitly rep states either of the following:\n\n* They spoke with my bank and my bank told them the money was deposited into my\n\naccount\n\n* They are doing an investigation(again)\n\nI have checked with my bank multiple times and they have told m e they have not been contacted by Remitly, and they have no received any funds from them so Remitly is clearly lying and refusing to provide any useful information. I have asked Remitly repeatedly to provide me with the emails they claim to have received from my bank stating the funds were deposited but they can't/won't. I have also asked to speak with the \"internal department\" conducting the investigation but have been told that I can't speak with them and that they will contact me once the investigation is completed.\n\nLast week I was told the investigation would be completed and I would get a resolution today 1/10/2024. When I called today I was told all of the above again and now they are\n\nsupposedly conducting a new investigation...\n\nI just filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau but other than that I don't know what I can do here.

Basically, if your full name and/or other information doesn't closely match, that could be part of the issue. Not saying it is, but very commonly people move and don't promptly update their state id / driver's license, etc. One is supposed to even if they just move down the street. While states generally don't enforce such stuff, it causes problems with automated verification many services use.\n\nIf your full name matches up and not moved at all, then something else triggered the review. Even how you accessed the website, such as through a VPN. Don't know if they have an app, but if using that, maybe had location turned off, which many sites utilize for additional fraud screening.\n\nBBB is a good start. See how that goes, but don't wait too long. If by end of week no progress, file a complaint with CFPB.\n\n## Comment ID khebnja with +1 score by [(Old_Gap_6174, Reddit, 2024-01-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Banking/comments/193cs4k/remitly_just_took_my_3000_dollars_what_can_i_do/khebnja/) (in reply to ID 193cs4k):\nHi u/notdoreen, I'm sorry to hear about the issues you're facing with Remitly.

When I created an account, they did nothing to verify my identity other than confirm my email.  They did nothing to confirm the accuracy or ownership of my bank account used for the transfer.  So security doesn't seem to be their strength.\n\nI also set up a Wise account.  When I wanted to do a transfer, they verify my email, they send 2FA verification codes with every sign-in.  They require more frequent sign-in and more frequent verification codes.  They require a picture of my identification and a selfie of myself.

I put all my information in as they asked.  I have an excellent credit rating..  They paused the transfer and I had to speak with \"security\"..The man grilled me for over half and hour..who was I sending it to (a gift for Christmas) was he family (he was a fried) ?  What was he using it for? , what was my source of income? (I gave an answer..and also said I was retired).  Who was my previous employer?  Would I be sending money again etc.?  This was a major credit card.  I have an excellent credit rating. They wanted a PDF of my last bank statement which I did send in the end. He could have asked for that in the beginning instead of putting me through an interrogation.  I  later spoke with customer service to see if the pause could be released and she started talking about how they were doing this for my safety etc. sending money to someone I had never met..and  I said I had met this person.  I had visited him and his family in Brazil.  Where did she get that idea I had never met him?  Why was asking about my employment not an invasion of my privacy.

They are an absolute waste of time. I tried to send 200 usd to a friend in Kenya over M-PESA (the local online money transfer tool). I made a payment over credit card (which first of all was rejected by the credit card company because Remitly is apparently often used for fraud). I got everything sorted out with my bank but then the problems with Remitly started:\n\nThey required an ID verification and uploading a video of me saying numbers and turning my head\nthen they took 1 hour to get back to me\nthen they requested a phone call. They let me waiting 20 minutes, just to say that the account was blocked and the transfer was cancelled\nthey stated I would get my money back in 10(!!!!) business days\nI contacted them to cancel the account. They were unwilling to cancel it.\nBottom line: a terrible waste of time\n\n## Comment ID i92rhjw with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/mpoe98/has_anyone_ever_sent_money_overseas_using_remitly/i92rhjw/) (in reply to ID mpoe98):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID i92rrn0 with +1 score by [(Educational_Sun3547, Reddit, 2022-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/mpoe98/has_anyone_ever_sent_money_overseas_using_remitly/i92rrn0/) (in reply to ID i92rhjw):\nThe people saying it's a scam cause they ask for your information are taking the piss.

I can second the issues with PayPal. For example, when I moved to the US, I updated my phone number, but it would keep reverting to my old number and attempt to send confirmation SMS to an old number I didn't have access to anymore. Unrelated (probably, because it happened much later), my PayPal account was blocked for \"suspicious activity\", even though I hadn't used it in awhile at all. I've made some abortive attempts at recovering the account, or making a new one, but eventually just said fuck it. \n\nWestern Union has been semi-okay, but it periodically does not work for no apparent reason at all (\"7777 \\[R1953\\]\") that nobody is able to explain or do anything about. This can be catastrophic if it happens at an inopportune time and you rely on it to send yourself money for travel expenses. \n\nI've been bouncing around different apps (Remitly, Wise, MoneyGram), all of which occasionally spazz around. Clearly, they all have some functional equivalent of epilepsy. \n\nWhat has been most reliable for me has been crypto. It asks no questions and it's fast (I use Binance and Coinbase). The only problem is to re-liquify it, so you might need a local friend to do that for you, if you don't have a local bank account. \n\nIf you found anything else that works remotely reliably, please let me know.\n\n## Comment ID lojwjy2 with +1 score by [(CallGold3141, Reddit, 2024-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/15qdiox/what_are_good_money_transfer_services_and_how_did/lojwjy2/) (in reply to ID 15qdiox):\nTry MyGuava, they are new and the app has a good set of services.

So I've been using Union Bank and HSBC as well since I've been here.\n\n## Comment ID kr9gxzz with +2 score by [(1inchtunnel, Reddit, 2024-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines_Expats/comments/1av98q0/atm_withdrawals_vs_remitly_or_wise_into_a/kr9gxzz/) (in reply to ID 1av98q0):\nDepending on how you access the transfer and the fees associated with the whole process, it really all depends on your personal preferences. We all do it differently, however for me having multiple ways to access your funds was the safest approach. You don’t want to get stuck with one to two options and then have those two options not available due to unforeseen reasons (just happened to me).\n\n1st find out the cheapest way you can access your funds. 2nd find out next cheapest way to access your funds. 3rd option could be via ATM (check for fees your bank may charge & check for fees the local ATM may charge) 4th option could be thru remittance to yourself either thru WU, Remitly, Wise, etc.\n\nI personally prefer linking US bank with Wise then transferring from Wise to local bank then to local bank to GCash, but I only have amount comfortable I’m having there.\n\n## Comment ID krchx9d with +2 score by [(her_straight_gf, Reddit, 2024-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines_Expats/comments/1av98q0/atm_withdrawals_vs_remitly_or_wise_into_a/krchx9d/) (in reply to ID 1av98q0):\nI have a verified Gcash account. Just remitly the amount straight to card and I'm good to go. Fee is $2 and it takes less than a minute.\n\nSome ATMs charge 50php to withdraw some don't.\n\n### Comment ID krcik74 with +2 score by [(Slow-Ship1055, Reddit, 2024-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines_Expats/comments/1av98q0/atm_withdrawals_vs_remitly_or_wise_into_a/krcik74/) (in reply to ID krchx9d):\nThanks for this information. A lot of people suggested GCash. I'll need to look more into that option because it seems having multiple different ways to access your cash is best.\n\n#### Comment ID krfzacu with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines_Expats/comments/1av98q0/atm_withdrawals_vs_remitly_or_wise_into_a/krfzacu/) (in reply to ID krcik74):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID krk631w with +2 score by [(Still-Music-5515, Reddit, 2024-02-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines_Expats/comments/1av98q0/atm_withdrawals_vs_remitly_or_wise_into_a/krk631w/) (in reply to ID 1av98q0):\nI've been using Wise for many years to send money directly from my US bank account directly to my Philippine bank account . Then if need can withdraw from their ATM for free using debit card.  Fees for using Wise are low and dependent on your verification level you can send large amounts with no issues.\n\n### Comment ID krk9cll with +1 score by [(Slow-Ship1055, Reddit, 2024-02-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines_Expats/comments/1av98q0/atm_withdrawals_vs_remitly_or_wise_into_a/krk9cll/) (in reply to ID krk631w):\nThanks for verifying what I've been thinking, almost exactly along the same lines.\n\n## Comment ID krw7n2k with +2 score by [(surprisesub, Reddit, 2024-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines_Expats/comments/1av98q0/atm_withdrawals_vs_remitly_or_wise_into_a/krw7n2k/) (in reply to ID 1av98q0):\nATM route has been better for me. More cost effective.  My bank refunds atm charges, so having to do 2 or 4 10k withdrawals is not that big of deal.  \nKeep a back up atm card if possible.\n\n### Comment ID krwrrh7 with +1 score by [(Slow-Ship1055, Reddit, 2024-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines_Expats/comments/1av98q0/atm_withdrawals_vs_remitly_or_wise_into_a/krwrrh7/) (in reply to ID krw7n2k):\nThank you.\n\n## Comment ID kr9nbft with +2 score by [(pdxtrader, Reddit, 2024-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines_Expats/comments/1av98q0/atm_withdrawals_vs_remitly_or_wise_into_a/kr9nbft/) (in reply to ID 1av98q0):\nUsing remitly is probably better than ATM because you can transfer up to $50,000 USD for $4.  I met a guy from Canada who basically transfers a few thousand dollars to himself at a time using remitly and pays fewer fees than if he was just taking 10,000 pesos at a time out from an ATM.  He said you can basically just walk into any bank and withdraw the transfer but he normally uses BDO\n\n### Comment ID krevlai with +6 score by [(BanMeForNothing, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines_Expats/comments/1av98q0/atm_withdrawals_vs_remitly_or_wise_into_a/krevlai/) (in reply to ID kr9nbft):\nDont use Remitly.

Transactions take forever, with constant delays and vague updates. When you try to reach out for help, you’re met with unhelpful, scripted responses from a customer service team that seems to care less about resolving issues.\n\nThey promise quick and easy transfers, but the reality is the complete opposite. My experience has been nothing but stress and frustration. It feels like they just don’t value their customers or respect their time and money.\n\nIf you’re looking for a dependable service to send money, DO NOT use Remitly. It’s simply not worth the headache.",

We are Remitly, Inc., also referred to as \"Remitly\", \"we\", \"us\", and \"our\" in this Agreement, a Delaware U.S.A. corporation with headquarters in Seattle, WA, together with its employees, directors, affiliates, successors, and assignees.\n\nAbout You. When we say \"you\" and \"your\" in this Agreement, that means you as the Remitly Account holder and user of the Service.\n\nYour Remitly Account. A Remitly Account is an account provided by Remitly that allows people who reside in the United States to send money transfers to people in other countries and regions. For avoidance of doubt, the Remitly Account is not a stored value account or other “balance” type account. You cannot hold funds in a Remitly Account.\n\nYou accept and agree to the terms of this Agreement (including all Policies) when you:\n\naccept the electronic version of this Agreement when the option is presented to you, such as when you register for the Remitly Service via our website or Mobile App; or\n\nstart using or attempt to use our Service, including if you access, download and/or use any of the Service. In such circumstances, we will treat your use of our Service as your acceptance of this Agreement.\n\nBy accepting this Agreement, you consent and agree to comply with the following additional policies (\"Policies\"):\n\nElectronic Communications Delivery Policy\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookie Policy.\n\nRemitly reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to modify this Agreement or any of the Policies listed above, including changing, adding, or removing portions of this Agreement, at any time. We will provide you with 30-days’ notice if our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities under this Agreement. By continuing to use the Service after any changes to this Agreement become effective, you agree and accept the changes. You can review the most current version of the Agreement at any time on our website at User Agreement. You agree that you shall not modify this Agreement and acknowledge that any attempts by you to modify this Agreement shall be void.\n\n2. THE SERVICE\n\nThe Service allows registered users to send international money transfers from the United States to Recipients in other countries served by Remitly. A list of the countries where Remitly can complete money transfers is available on our website and Mobile App. Remitly reserves the right to stop offering money transfers to any country at any time, on a temporary or permanent basis, without notice to you.\n\nA \"Sender\" uses the Service to send money and a \"Recipient\" receives money sent through the Service. A \"Transaction\" refers to an order from a Sender that instructs us to send money to a Recipient through the Service. The \"Transaction Amount\" is the amount in US dollars that the Sender provides to Remitly for transmittal to the Recipient. The \"Payout Amount\" is the amount paid out to the Recipient.\n\nThe Service should only be used to send money to people that you know and trust, such as family and friends. Do not use the Service to send money to people you do not know, are not familiar with, or do not trust.\n\nAlways be on the lookout for fraud. We urge you to think carefully before sending money to anyone that you do not know well. You should be cautious of deals or offers that seem too good to be true. Please contact us immediately by telephone at 1-844-604-0924 if you think you have been or might be a victim of fraud.\n\nIf you are aware of anyone or any entity that is using the Service inappropriately, please email us at abuse@remitly.com. If you receive any fake (phishing) emails, purporting to be from Remitly, please forward them to us at abuse@remitly.com.\n\nRemitly, Inc. is a licensed money transmitter throughout the United States. Additional information regarding Remitly’s money transmission licenses can be found on the state licenses page of our website. Remitly, Inc. is not licensed to provide the Service outside of the United States of America. As a result, the Service may not be available for use in countries other than the United States.\n\n3.

SENDING A TRANSACTION\n\nGeneral. Using your Remitly Account, you can send money to a Recipient by providing us with information about you and a Recipient. You can send money to a Recipient, and a Recipient can receive funds sent by you, even if they do not have a Remitly Account or use the Service.\n\nProcessing Your Transactions. If you submit a Transaction, you are requesting that we process that Transaction. For you to initiate a Transaction through the Service and for us to process a Transaction on your behalf, you must provide us with information about a valid Payment Instrument that you want to use to fund your Transaction through your Remitly Account. If we are unable to process your Transaction using the Payment Instrument you select, we will notify you and request that you choose another Payment Instrument to complete your transaction. You agree that we may accept or reject your offer to process your Transaction under the terms of this Agreement. We are not under any obligation to carry out any Transaction that you request if, for example, you have broken any of your obligations set out in this Agreement.\n\nBank Account Payment Authorization. When you fund a Transaction and/or pay any Service Fees using your bank account as the Payment Instrument, you authorize the initiation of ACH debit or credit entries, as applicable, to that bank account in accordance with any payment instructions you provide, and the crediting of funds to your bank account for Transactions that are refunded, canceled or otherwise returned.\n\nCard Payment Authorization. When you fund a Transaction and/or pay any Service Fees using a credit or debit card, you authorize us, for the purpose of processing your Transaction, to debit or charge that Payment Instrument to fund the Transaction by the amount you specify, plus any Service Fees, and to send those funds to the designated Recipient immediately upon our receipt of the Transaction. You can withdraw your authorization for us to charge your debit or credit card by removing it from your Remitly Account. If your payment fails, you authorize us to re-try one or more times using the same debit or credit card, subject to limitations under applicable law.\n\nRemitly’s Liability. When you send a Transaction through our Service, it is your responsibility to make sure that all the Transaction details are complete, accurate, and correct (including, without limitation, the Recipient’s information and the Recipient’s banking or other account details) as we may not be able to let you change the details of your Transaction once it is submitted to us for processing.\n\nTo the extent allowed by law, you agree to be bound by all payment instructions or Transactions that are initiated through the Service from your Remitly Account. You must make sure that all payment instructions for your Transactions are correct and accurate.\n\nYou are solely responsible for entering the correct information for the Recipient to whom you are sending money. Subject to applicable law, you, not Remitly, are responsible for any amounts that are transferred to the incorrect person because you entered incorrect information related to the Recipient for a Transaction.\n\nSubject to limitations under applicable law, Remitly shall not be liable for a failure to complete Transactions in the following circumstances:\n\nyour payment instructions contain inaccurate instructions, mistakes, or insufficient information; or\n\nyour chosen Payment Instrument does not have sufficient funds to pay for a Transaction you initiate through the Service.\n\n7. PAYING FOR THE SERVICE\n\nOur Service Fee. In consideration for providing you with our Service, you agree to pay us a service fee (a \"Service Fee\") for each Transaction you submit, in addition to the Transaction Amount. Details on the discrete Service Fee amount related to a specific Transaction will be made available to you in our Mobile App or website before you give us your consent to execute your Transaction. Payment in US dollars is due and payable by you to us at the time the Transaction is submitted for processing. Service Fees may vary based on Recipient country and other factors and are subject to change.\n\nOther Charges. We are not responsible for fees that may be imposed by financial institutions associated with your Payment Instruments. For example, some credit card issuers may treat the use of your credit card to use the Service as a \"cash advance\" and may impose additional fees and interest costs for the transaction. Remitly is not responsible for any non-sufficient funds fees (“NSF Fees”), chargeback fees, or other, similar charges that might be imposed on you by your bank, credit card issuer, or other provider. If you submit a Transaction that results in Remitly being charged a fee or another amount because of your Payment Instrument not being used in an authorized manner, or with insufficient funds or credit, we will notify you of the fee we were charged, and you agree to pay us the equivalent amount.\n\nForeign Currency Exchange. We and our Service Providers (defined below) may make money when you pay for a Transaction in one currency and the Transaction is paid out in another currency because of the difference between the exchange rate at which we buy foreign currency and the exchange rate provided to you at the time of your Transaction. Exchange rates may vary based on Recipient country and other factors and are subject to change. If a foreign currency exchange rate applies to a Transaction that you request, it will be disclosed to you before you authorize the Transaction.\n\nThird-Party Fees and Charges. When you use our Service, other third parties may level fees, costs, or other liabilities against you. These third-parties may include your bank, card issuer, phone provider, or internet service provider. For example, your phone and/or internet service provider may charge you fees relating to data or messaging services. You (and not Remitly) are responsible for any fees, charges, costs, and/or expenses charged by such third parties in connection with your use of our Service. Please check your agreements with these third-party providers for details on any of these additional costs.\n\n8. RECEIVING A REMITTANCE\n\nService Providers. We work with local banks and other third-party outlets (each, a \"Service Provider\") to make funds available to Recipients. We try to provide current information on our website about the location, availability, and hours of our Service Providers. Please note that these may be subject to change without our knowing, and we are not responsible for any inaccurate or incomplete information that may be posted on the website.\n\nVerification of Recipients. Recipients may be required to provide information, such as a valid identification, to verify their identities to our Service Providers before receiving funds. Recipients may also be required to provide a reference number or another similar identifier associated with the applicable Transactions.\n\nExpired Transactions. We will cancel Transactions where funds are made available to Recipients by way of cash pick-up if the funds are not validly collected within 60 calendar days of when they were first made available. To the extent possible for these expired transactions, we will refund the full Transaction Amount, taxes, and any Service Fees that you paid as part of the Transaction. If we are unable to return the funds to this Payment Instrument after a legally required time has passed, the funds will be escheated to the applicable state.\n\n9. IMPORTANT SERVICE RESTRICTIONS\n\nOur Right to Limit Your Use of Our Service. In addition to the limitations described elsewhere in this Agreement, we may refuse to process any Transaction in our sole discretion where we have a reasonable belief or a reasonable basis to believe, that it is necessary to protect you and/or us or when it is otherwise required so that we may comply with legal or regulatory requirements. You agree that we may also limit the amount to be transferred, either on a per transaction or aggregated basis. These limits may be imposed on individual Remitly Accounts or specific Payment Instruments in your Remitly Account. We also reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue all or any part of the Service.\n\nDelays. We have the sole discretion to delay your Transaction, in accordance with applicable law, to verify your identity, validate your Payment Instrument, manage our financial risk, or if we believe that the Transaction may involve fraud or that a crime or violation of law, rule, or regulation has occurred, is occurring, or may occur. Depending on the reason for a delay or a failure to make the funds available to the Recipient, you may be entitled to a refund or other remedies in certain circumstances.\n\nTransfer Speed. Any transfer speed information or estimates for any of your Transactions that we provide to you on our website or in our Mobile App are estimates of the delivery date and time based on payment method, delivery method, transaction review, and system availability of Remitly, our partners and Service Providers. In addition to any transfer speed information and estimates we provide during the send process, before you submit a Transaction, and in your Transaction receipt, we will provide you with an exact date and time when you can expect your money to be delivered to your Recipient.\n\nCommercial Transactions. We are not responsible for the quality or delivery of goods or services for which you pay a Recipient by using the Service. You accept that using the Service to transfer funds for payments for goods and services is at your own risk.\n\nIneligibility. To comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may refuse Transactions from certain Senders and to certain Recipients that are included on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list, Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories list, and such other lists as issued by different government agencies.\n\nNo Changes. We generally do not let you change the details of your Transaction once it is submitted to us for processing. It is your responsibility to make sure your Transaction details are accurate. Pursuant to Section 6.5 and other Sections of this Agreement, you, and not Remitly, shall be responsible for any incorrect information or mistakes that you make when entering information about the Recipient for a Transaction. Nothing in this Agreement, however, shall be construed to limit your rights with respect to canceling Transactions or asserting an error with respect to a Transaction under applicable law.\n\nProhibited Activities.

You can attempt to cancel your transaction at any time prior to its completion. Completion of your Transaction means that your recipient has picked up the funds you sent for cash pick-up or the funds have been deposited into the Recipient’s bank account at the time of your cancellation request. Upon receipt of a cancellation request, we will confirm whether the transaction has been completed, which may include communicating with our Service Providers to determine whether the transaction has been completed prior to initiating a refund. Remitly’s ability to stop or cancel a Transaction depends on the method you select to disburse the funds to your Recipient and the time when you submit your cancellation request. If we can cancel the Transaction, we will refund the Transaction Amount, taxes, and any Service Fees that we charged you as part of the Transaction. The Transaction Amount will not be refunded after the Completion of the Transaction.\n\nUndeliverable Transactions.

We reserve the right to cancel your Transaction if you fail to take action to correct the mistake or issue with the Transaction within 72 hours. If we cancel your Transaction because you fail to take action to correct the mistake or issue, we will refund the full Transaction Amount, taxes, and any Service Fees that you paid as part of the Transaction.\n\nRefunds.\n\na.

All refunds will be credited to the same Payment Instrument used to pay for the Transaction. Refunds are only made in U.S. dollars and will not be adjusted to account for changes in the value of the U.S. dollar or foreign currency from the time your Transaction was submitted. If the Payment Instrument you used to pay for the original Transaction is no longer valid and we are unable to find a mutually acceptable solution, your refund may be delayed until we are able to process it in a commercially reasonable manner.\n\nc. Perfect Delivery Promise. Before you submit a Transaction, and in your Transaction receipt, we will provide you with an exact date and time when you can expect your money to be delivered to your Recipient. If your money is delivered after the date and time we display both prior to sending your Transaction and in your receipt, you are eligible for a refund of the Service Fees we charged for the Transaction. To receive this refund of the Service Fees, you must contact us via the methods listed below and request a refund of the Service Fees charged on the Transaction at issue.\n\nSend us an email to us-complaints@remitly.com;\n\ncontact us at our Complaints Page;\n\ncall us at 1-844-604-0924; or\n\nmail us at Remitly, Inc. attn: Customer Service, 1111 3rd Ave, Suite 2400, Seattle, WA 98101, USA.\n\nd.

During this period, You and Remitly agree that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled.

Information regarding JAMS may be found on its website at https://www.jamsadr.com/. You and Remitly also agree that any dispute as to the applicability of this Section 19, the arbitrability of a Claim, or the scope or enforceability of this Section 19 will be decided by the arbitrator.\n\nThe rules governing any arbitration between You and Remitly will depend on the amount in controversy. For Claims between You and Remitly where the total value of all Claims (including attorneys’ fees to the extent provided under applicable law) exceeds $250,000, the arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures. A Copy of JAMS’ Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures is available at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.

However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow the terms as a court would. For the avoidance of doubt, the arbitrator can award public injunctive relief if authorized by law and warranted by the individual claim(s).\n\na. Mass Arbitration.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, You and Remitly agree that if the total value of all Claims between you and Remitly is below the jurisdictional limit of the small claims court in the state in which you reside, then the party asserting such Claims may do so in a small-claims action in the state in which you reside.\n\ne. Costs and Fees Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the applicable JAMS rules, subject to any state limitations on arbitration costs. If you prevail in arbitration you may be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Remitly will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Claim or the relief sought to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.\n\nf. Federal Arbitration Act. You and Remitly agree that this Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and therefore the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.) applies including its procedural provisions, in all respects.

You and Remitly agree to submit to personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within and encompassing King County, Washington for purposes of litigating all such Claims.\n\nSeverability of Arbitration Provision. In the event that an arbitrator determines that 19.2.B (JURY WAIVER AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER) is unenforceable or invalid, this entire Section 19 shall be severed from the Agreement and the Agreement shall be enforced as if the Agreement did not contain this Section 19.\n\n20. Governing Law.\n\nFor disputes over the meaning of this Agreement, other than the terms of Section 19, you and Remitly agree that this Agreement shall be governed by, and all Claims resolved in accordance with the laws of Washington, except that body of law governing conflicts of laws, and all activities performed in connection with the Service shall be deemed to have been performed in Washington.\n\n21.

The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Remitly and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Remitly.\n\nNo Waiver. The failure of Remitly to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Agreement is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give appropriately valid effect to the intention of the Agreement as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n\nForce Majeure. Except to the extent required under applicable law with respect to a Transaction that has already been accepted, we shall not be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of the Service to the extent such failure or delay is caused by matters beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation: changes in applicable laws; closure or unavailability of required physical and network infrastructure; sovereign default; power or internet failure; civil unrest; war; and earthquake, fire, flood, or other natural disasters.\n\n22.

      "# [Gabor Pasztor: Steering Miami’s Youth to Success Through Soccer by Ali Mollhoff on 2024-02-01](https://news.remitly.com/community-social-impact/gabor-pasztor-miami-youth-soccer/)\nSports, particularly soccer, offer a meaningful way for many immigrants to build community while staying connected to their heritage. As a leading digital financial services provider for immigrants and their families, Remitly is committed to transforming lives that transcend borders, and we further this impact through initiatives that engage global communities in meaningful ways. Last year, Remitly and its employees supported over 200 global nonprofits through giving and volunteering, many of which focused on supporting immigrants and their families.\n\nIn addition, over the last several years, Remitly has supported non-profit organizations serving immigrants in North America via partnerships, community events, and other programs. In line with this commitment, in 2023 Remitly collaborated with TeamSnap, an app utilized by sports organizations to stay connected with players and their families, to sponsor local sports leagues in Miami along with their annual Coach of the Year award. This player-nominated award honors exceptional youth soccer coaches who have transformed the lives of their teams. Winning teams receive funding which can be used to support team costs including equipment, uniforms, or grants to cover team registration fees for families in need.\n\nTeamSnap’s 2023 Coach of the Year award honored Gabor Pasztor, owner of Athletic Club Miami in South Florida. As a decorated international athlete and a Hungarian immigrant, Gabor shared how his belief in the transformative power of sports led him to open Athletic Club Miami and inspired a passion for positively impacting the lives of young players.\n\nA decorated past\n\nFor Gabor, a passion for sports runs deep—both of his parents were Olympic gymnasts in Hungary and, as a child, he quickly followed in their footsteps until age 11. Gabor was seen playing soccer by a coach near a local school and was invited to a soccer league where he excelled; six years later, he was offered a contract to play professionally with a Division Three soccer club.\n\n“I was only 18 and I found myself at a crossroads. My college did not allow me to play at my pro club for money, so if I wanted to continue my education I had to leave my adult club and join the college soccer team,” he recalls. “During my first year in college, the track coaches invited me to some running events to help the school; it went so well that I moved into the track program with the promise that if everything went well one day, I could make it to the national team.” At the time, Gabor was attending school, competing in track, and coaching twice a week. “I wanted to achieve academically and continue to compete on a high level,” Gabor says.\n\nWhile in college, Gabor received the offer of his dreams: a place on the National Track Team. He traveled to Istanbul, Turkey to represent Hungary at his first European Cup event in 2008. Gabor rediscovered his love of soccer when he immigrated to Miami in 2012, working as a coach for an afterschool youth soccer team. With close to 60% of Miami’s population being born in a different country and soccer being one of the most popular sports in the world, Gabor saw an opportunity to make his mark by creating his own club, especially as a seasoned coach and athlete. “I had seen how the best soccer coaches work, and what systems work best,” he says. “I saw what could be better and what the parents were looking for, and I followed my instincts.”\n\nBuilding the American Dream\n\nAfter two months of working at the afterschool program as a coach, Gabor set plans to establish his own club in motion. “As an employee, I was able to gain some insights into how the business works without any risk,” he says. Without any upfront investment or marketing budget, Gabor personally distributed thousands of flyers in his neighborhood. “At the time, I lived in a 52-floor skyscraper and went to every floor via the stairs because I didn’t want to wait for the elevator,” he recalls. “I went to a neighboring building next door with 44 floors and did the same thing. I squatted down and slid flyers to every apartment on my own.”\n\nHis dedication paid off, and soon, he had seven children on his first team. However, he didn’t stop there—Gabor also created a non-profit arm of his company, awarding scholarships to families who can’t afford the full membership cost. “Many of my players and their families are from Latin America, and a lot of them just started their life here,” he says.\n\nA bridge between two worlds\n\nFor many immigrants, soccer offers a sense of community and connection when far from home. Gabor’s team has both first and second-generation immigrants, who each face their own set of challenges. “Many of my players were born here and understand American culture more than their parents, but a lot of them moved to America at a young age,” he says. “They still have language barriers like I had, and some cultural surprises that come up.” For the teammates, being a part of Athletic Club Miami offers a sense of belonging, especially in a new environment. “The camaraderie the players build is an important thing,” he says. “My players are meeting with other soccer players within our club on birthdays and holidays. Their friendships become stronger because of these shared experiences on and off the field.”\n\nThe feeling of community extends beyond the players and to their families, too. Gabor recalls a time when some parents pooled money for a few of his players who couldn’t afford a team trip to Europe. “These parents knew some of the players couldn’t afford the trip, but donated money because they knew the kids worked really hard for over two years,” he says. “The sacrifices these parents make for the team are amazing. Everyone is always looking out and helping each other.”\n\nGabor, who describes his coaching style as a “tough love” approach rooted in discipline and rigor, sets high expectations for his students. “To excel in a sport at a high level, you need to work a lot and change your lifestyle. I see my kids want to get better, and it’s great to see how these changes affect other areas of their lives,” he says. “They start to think about eating better, they’re going to sleep earlier, and they start to read more to learn about soccer or their other interests. They learn how to become better physically and mentally.”\n\nGabor embodies his approach in the Club’s motto: “More than a practice, it’s a lifestyle! More than a game, it is your self-expression!” Soccer’s inclusive nature also makes it a confidence booster for children of various ages and abilities. “With other sports, you have to be really fast or strong to be a part of it, but soccer is different,” he says. “You can be short or tall, fast or slow, experienced or inexperienced. It’s a year-round sport, so any kid can continue to develop the skills to be a great soccer player.”\n\nFor Gabor, seeing his players develop their character on and off the field is as important as winning. “It’s about improvement and building up great character traits in the long term, even if most of the players won’t play at the college level,” he says.\n\nThe best reward\n\nGabor views winning TeamSnap’s Coach of the Year award and receiving recognition from his players and their families as one of the many high points in his coaching career. “When you get great feedback you feel like you’re on a good path, and that the decisions you’ve made in your career were the right ones,” he says. “To see the children you work with improve every day is very rewarding.”\n\nSports, particularly soccer, offer a meaningful way for many immigrants to build community while staying connected to their heritage.

      "# [11 Common Money Transfer Scams and How to Avoid Them by Evelyne Kuo on 2024-08-08](https://blog.remitly.com/money-transfer/money-transfer-scams/)\nPeople send hundreds of billions of dollars in remittances every year. And sadly, because of this volume, certain scammers try to trick people through different money transfer scams.\n\nHere at Remitly, we want to help you understand how these money transfer scams work and recognize the warning signs of potential fraud so you can keep your money safe.\n\n11 Common Money Transfer Scams\n\nAs people become better at recognizing fraudulent activities, such as credit card theft and wire transfer fraud, scammers are also improving their methods.\n\nSince tracing many of these scams might be complicated, your best protection is learning to spot potential fraudulent acts when you encounter them.\n\nThese are some of the most common scams we encounter here at Remitly as we work tirelessly to keep our customers’ information safe.\n\nPlease note, if you send a transfer to a scammer, we might not be able to help, and you could lose your money.\n\n1. Family emergency scams\n\nIn this type of scam, the victim is led to believe that they are sending funds to help a loved one or friend in an emergency situation.\n\nScammers exploit the victim’s natural worry for someone they care about. This can involve a car accident, being stranded at an airport, or avoiding arrest‌.\n\nThe scammer may place an urgent phone call, posing as a relative, friend, or loved one or as a figure of authority such as a law enforcement official or medical doctor.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nVerify the emergency by contacting the loved one or friend directly.\n\nDo not rush the transaction. Take time to verify the situation.\n\nBe suspicious of requests for secrecy or urgency.\n\nBe wary of unsolicited calls or messages from unknown individuals.\n\n2. Extortion scams\n\nAn extortion scam involves the act of obtaining an individual’s property, assets, or money through threatened or actual force, violence, and intimidation. Sextortion is a type of extortion where a perpetrator threatens to expose sexually compromising information, such as sexually explicit private images or videos of the victim, unless the victim meets certain demands, usually money.\n\nVictims tend to be younger adults or elders.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nBe cautious about who you connect with on social media and dating sites.\n\nDo not engage in explicit video chat or exchange sexually explicit images with strangers.\n\nDo not send money to someone who is threatening to expose intimate photos or videos.\n\nBe wary of false communication from law enforcement officials.\n\n3. Threats/Blackmail scams\n\nThreats/blackmail scams involve scammers unlawfully obtaining money from a victim through coercion. The scammer threatens to harm the victim if they do not cooperate.\n\nThe scammer may relate personal information in the email or call to add intimidation. They may threaten physical harm, claim to know where you live or work, and threaten to hurt you or your loved ones unless you pay up.\n\nScammers may also threaten the victim with arrest or jail time if they do not comply with the demands.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nDo not comply with the scammer’s demands.\n\nContact law enforcement immediately if you feel threatened or scared.\n\nBe wary of unsolicited calls or messages from unknown individuals.\n\nBe cautious about sharing personal information online or in response to unsolicited calls or messages.\n\n4. Imposter scams\n\nIn an imposter scam, a scammer poses as an authoritative individual and requests money to sort out a false situation.\n\nScammers may also pose as representatives from a reputable business (business impersonators), or financial institutions and make false claims of fraudulent charges that need to be reviewed or refunded or as overpayments to steal from the victim.\n\nThey make false claims about fraudulent charges and bank transfers, refunds, shipment issues, or other bogus fees that will cause the victim to share personal and/or financial information. Scammers may even hack the customer’s phone in order to process unauthorized transactions.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nBe cautious about sharing personal information online or in response to unsolicited calls or messages.\n\nVerify the legitimacy of the representative or business.\n\nDo not share financial information over the phone or email.\n\nDo not trust unsolicited communication from unknown individuals or businesses.\n\n5. Investment scams\n\nInvestment scams often sound “too good to be true” or offer “risk-free” investment opportunities. They pressure victims to invest immediately, sometimes indicating the opportunity is for a limited time.\n\nThe victim is often lured through social media apps or cold calls/email inquiries.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nBe cautious of investment opportunities that sound too good to be true or pressure you to invest immediately.\n\nDo your research and verify the legitimacy of the investment before investing any money.\n\nDo not invest money you cannot afford to lose.\n\n6. Romance scams\n\nIn a romance scam, the victim is tricked into thinking they’ve found true love online. Scammers play with your emotions, pretending to be interested in a romantic relationship. They use flattering words and stolen pictures to win trust and affection.\n\nOnce they have the victim hooked, they ask for money or gift cards. They might claim it’s for a plane ticket to meet up or to cover unexpected medical expenses. They prey on the desire for love and companionship, making it hard to say no.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nVerify the person’s identity by doing a reverse image search or asking for a video call.\n\nBe suspicious of requests for secrecy or urgency, as scammers often use these tactics.\n\nBe cautious of unsolicited messages or calls from strangers professing love or interest.\n\n7. Tech support scams\n\nTech support scams involve scammers posing as representatives from reputable companies like Microsoft or Apple and claiming that the victim’s computer requires tech services in order to gain access remotely and steal from the customer.\n\nTypically, victims receive an unsolicited phone call, text message, or email from an individual claiming to represent a company’s “Tech Support,” “Help Desk,” “IT Department,” or a similar office.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nRemember that reputable companies will never contact you out of the blue and ask for access to your computer.\n\nNever provide personal or financial information to unsolicited callers or email senders.\n\nIndependently verify the legitimacy of any request for tech support services.\n\n8. Immigration scams\n\nIf you receive a call from someone claiming to be an immigration official, it’s okay to feel suspicious immediately. Scammers may call you and claim there’s a problem with your immigration documents that you can solve by making an immediate money transfer or providing your account information.\n\nThey may even provide personal information or make threats of deportation, but you should never give out personal financial information.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nRemember that the USCIS and the government will never ask you to transfer money to an individual. You can only pay any fees on the USCIS online portal or Pay.gov.\n\nDon’t provide any personal or financial information to people you don’t trust.\n\nBe sure to contact USCIS directly if you need help with any immigration processes.\n\nUnfortunately, you may come across other scams as the methods change frequently. Learning to recognize general warning signs of scams can help you stay safe.\n\n9. Prize scams\n\nWith the prize wire money and transfer scam, criminals attempt to steal money with phony sweepstakes, lotteries, or contests. Usually, the scam begins with an unexpected email or phone call saying that you won a cash prize in another country.\n\nThe scammer might ask for your bank account information so that they can directly deposit the winnings and then use the information to conduct fraudulent activity with your bank account.\n\nAnother version of the scam works similarly to some other money and wire transfer scams. The fraudsters send a fake check to the victim and then tell the victim to wire money to them to cover fees like currency conversion or processing fees.\n\nAfter you deposit the check and transfer or wire money, you find the check fake. You may be subject to fees from your bank and be out the transferred or wired money.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nResearch any unfamiliar contests or sweepstakes before wiring money.\n\nNever initiate money or wire transfers until you’re certain checks have cleared.\n\nCall the issuing bank of any check received to verify funds and authenticity.\n\nNever give your bank account information to an unknown party.\n\n10. Job scams\n\nA job scam is when a fraudster advertises a fake job, such as a secret shopper position or work-from-home opportunity, through social media, fake websites, and even roadside signs.\n\nWhen you express interest in the job, the scammer may put you through a fake interview process, asking you to answer questions and provide personal information.\n\nThen, they’ll tell you that you’re hired but explain that you need to transfer or wire money to cover processing fees to enroll you in their work-from-home program, to pay for necessary equipment, or to complete a mandatory training course.\n\nYou only find out that the job was fake all along after the money’s been sent.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nCheck the Better Business Bureau and state business registration records to confirm the validity of companies.\n\nBe wary of sending money for any employment opportunity.\n\nUse caution for any job offer that seems too good to be true.\n\n11. Marketplace scams\n\nMarketplace schemes seek to take advantage of people buying and selling things through Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, eBay, and other sites.\n\nThere are two versions of this scam. With the first, a fake buyer asks if they can pay for an item via money order, personal check, or cashier’s check.\n\nIf the seller says yes, the buyer sends a fake check or money order for more than the sale price. The buyer will then ask the seller to transfer or wire the extra money back to them. After they go through with wiring or transferring money, the check turns out to be bad.\n\nFake sellers can also try to perpetrate this money or wire transfer scam. With this version, a fraudster lists an appealing item for sale on a marketplace site.\n\nIf you express interest, they will ask you to send money or a wire transfer and tell you they will ship the item after receiving the funds.\n\nOnce you wire money to them, they will contact you and say there is a problem. Most often, fake sellers will claim that they didn’t receive money and ask you to provide the money transfer control number so that they can track the payment. If you give them this number, they will pick up cash and never send the purchased item.\n\nA common marketplace scam is called a fake check scam in which the scammer requests the recipient to cash a check for a purchase or service and then asks to wire part of the funds back to cover certain expenses.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nDon’t accept a personal check, money order, or cashier’s check when selling things online.\n\nOnly process transactions through sales platforms, being wary of anyone who asks you to go outside the system to avoid fees.\n\nCheck reviews and ratings for buyers and sellers.\n\nNever agree to wire money to pay for something that you buy through an online marketplace.\n\nCommon signs of financial scams\n\nNot sure whether something is a scam? Watch out for these red flags:\n\nThey insist on handling everything by email, text, or social media messages.\n\nThere are misspellings or serious grammar issues in communications.\n\nThe return email address is strange or unrecognized.\n\nThey put pressure on you to send money quickly.\n\nThey ask you to send money to a foreign country even though they claim to be in the U.S.\n\nYou’re asked to use cashier’s checks, wire transfers, or other potentially untraceable funds.\n\nStaying safe from money transfer scams\n\nFollow these steps to safeguard your money and your information:\n\nNever give out personal information on an unsolicited call or message.\n\nDon’t send money to someone you don’t know personally.\n\nContact family members at known phone numbers if you receive an unfamiliar request from them.\n\nRegularly update your passwords.\n\nInstall blockers for pop-ups and antivirus software.\n\nDo not share your login information for Remitly, online banking information, or login credentials for other financial apps.\n\nReport money and wire transfer scams\n\nIf you discover that someone has stolen funds from you, act quickly by contacting Remitly or the wire transfer provider you used. In some cases, it may be possible to recover your hard-earned money.\n\nEven if a fraudster was unsuccessful in committing money transfer or wire fraud because you caught onto the scheme, you should report the attempt. The Federal Trade Commission offers a detailed guide on how to report wire transfer scams that you can access here.\n\nAlthough criminals do try to exploit the wire transfer system to their advantage, wire and money transfers are still a convenient way to send money to your loved ones located abroad. By following the tips outlined in this article, you can do so more safely and protect yourself from fraud.",
      "# [Remitly Pricing, Rates, and Fees: A Transparent Guide by Evelyne Kuo on 2023-11-01](https://blog.remitly.com/finance/how-remittance-companies-set-rates/)\nIf you send money from one country to another, you know that fees are often involved. You might even have shopped around for better rates from a remittance company. In recent years, money transfer apps have been able to reduce fees, which in turn means that more money makes it home. But do you know how remittance companies set their rates? We’ve put together this helpful guide to explain how it works.\n\nBefore we get started, the basics: a remittance is simply a transfer of funds. Typically, we use the word “remittance” to describe money sent by overseas workers or immigrants to their home communities across the globe. This might be as a wire transfer, bank transfer, or other type of international money transfer.\n\nRemittances are vital to the global economy. According to UN News, they help millions of families with financial stability, with an estimated 75% of remittances used to put food on the table and cover medical or housing expenses.\n\nSo, How Do Remittance Companies Work?\n\nA remittance service makes it possible for you to send money across borders safely and efficiently. Here’s how they do it.\n\nThe remittance company purchases the currency and keeps it on hand. When you want to send money, you are purchasing this currency from the remittance company, generally at or slightly below the rate that they paid for it (except in the case of special promotional offers), plus any associated fees. Then the money is sent to your loved ones back home.\n\nLast year, we spoke to Michael Manser, then our Director of Revenue Management at Remitly, to get more insight into the process.\n\nThe Role of Exchange Rates\n\nThe exchange rate is the value of one currency as compared to another. For example, if you’re sending money to relatives in India, your funds will be converted to the rupee (INR). As of this writing, $1 USD is equivalent to roughly 75 INR. To send the equivalent of $1,000 USD, you’d need to send your relative 75,000 INR.\n\nExchange rates vary each day, based on several global factors. Manser explains that these include: “supply and demand, political and economic stability, government debt, interest rates, inflation rates, and other macroeconomic factors.”\n\nExchange rates may also change rapidly and unexpectedly. For example, if a country suddenly enters a period of significant political turmoil, you could see an immediate drop in demand for its currency. Not all economic drops can be forecast in advance. In fact, many cannot be.\n\nLet’s take a look again at the example of USD to INR. If more people want dollars than rupees, that will impact the exchange rate between the two. Specifically, as the demand for dollars increases, the value of the dollar will rise. All else equal, a dollar will now buy more rupees, or said another way, the exchange rate will increase.\n\nIn the situation above, where the USD to INR exchange rate increases, some remittance companies may be in a situation where they purchased currency prior to the rate moving. If they purchased INR at 1 USD = 75 INR and the rate jumps to 1 USD = 76 INR, they may continue to offer a rate near 75 INR.\n\nThe original purchase at 75 INR represents the company’s inventory, and they will go through that inventory near the rate at which they purchased the currency before buying more currency and adjusting the rate offered to the customer. This is why some remittance companies sometimes have a set exchange rate for a period of time, even as foreign exchange rates fluctuate.\n\nHow Does Remitly Set Its Rates and Fees?\n\nWhen Remitly sets exchange rates and fees, we have to consider how much it costs to move money from one country to another. For example, the cost to Remitly is different whether a customer pays with a bank account, debit card, or credit card.\n\nThe method of delivery is also a key component of setting prices. Why? Because Remitly often needs to pay our destination partners different costs for different methods (bank deposit, mobile money, cash pick-up, etc.). These, among other cost factors, all combine to create different environments for each unique origination-destination country pair. Looking at each country independently like this allows Remitly to set unique prices.\n\nManser explains that setting fair, competitive rates and fees for Remitly customers is top of mind every day.\n\n“Our customers are at the core of everything we do. No pricing decision is made at Remitly without considering how it will affect our customers,” Manser says. “We want to ensure that we are providing a great value so that more money makes it home.”\n\nThe true test of whether Remitly is getting it right? Seeing customers come back after they make their initial money transfer. Nothing is better than knowing we’ve provided a great service for our customers.\n\nBusting Myths about Exchange Rates\n\nThe mid-market rate, often cited in financial news as the “real” rate, is more a benchmark than a rate you can access. It’s the halfway point between what banks buy and sell currencies for.\n\nHere’s the kicker: it’s mostly out of reach for personal money transfers. Services that claim to offer this rate may actually be compensating by sliding in fees elsewhere. Essentially, every service makes a profit; it’s just a matter of where they’re adding their margin.\n\nAt Remitly, we focus on the overall price for the customer, not just the rate, to help our customers get the most value.\n\nHow Are International Money Transfer Services Evolving?\n\nRemittances are a crucial part of the world’s economic development. In the past, traditional money transfer services or bank wires could be slow and expensive. Digital payment technology has improved this picture.\n\nOnline money transfers allow people to send funds to their loved ones with peace of mind. The best remittance services are continuing to improve transfer times, reduce costs, and maintain the safety of their customers.",

      "# [Remitly, Payoneer cross-border payments climb by Lynne Marek on 2024-11-08](https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/remitly-payoneer-western-union-cross-border-payments/732400/)\nFor Remitly and Payoneer, cross-border payments volume and revenue soared during the third quarter, according to their earnings reports, but activity at their larger legacy rival Western Union was more tepid.\n\nRemitly, which caters to consumers seeking to send payments to people in other countries, reported third-quarter send volume jumped 42% over the year-earlier period to $14.5 billion, according to an earnings press release issued last week. That increase was the company’s highest in eight quarters as it logged a record number of new customers, Remitly Chief Financial Officer Vikas Mehta told analysts on an Oct. 30 webcast discussion of the results.\n\nThe activity pushed Seattle-based Remitly’s revenue up 39% over the year-ago quarter to $336.5 million, the company said. The company isn’t necessarily counting on the heightened use to continue in the fourth quarter, Mehta said.\n\nThe company experienced some “tailwinds, especially with the strength in the U.S. corridors,” Mehta said on the webcast. “While some of those tailwinds could continue, we thought it prudent not to include or bake them in into our Q4 outlook.”\n\nThe activity led to net income of $1.9 million for Remitly for the third-quarter, compared to a loss of $35.7 million for the year-earlier period, according to an earnings presentation.\n\nAt Payoneer, which targets its cross-border payments service at the business-to-business market, the company reported record quarterly volume as that third-quarter metric rose 25% to $20.4 billion, according to a Tuesday earnings press release.\n\nThat jacked up Payoneer’s quarterly revenue by 19% to $248.3 million, more than tripling net income to $41.6 million for the quarter.\n\nNew York-based Payoneer, which has been expanding by way of acquisitions, has increasingly sought to satisfy larger companies’ cross-border needs, as part of a revised strategy introduced by CEO John Caplan. Before Caplan took the top post last year, Payoneer had focused more on providing payment service to small and mid-sized businesses using e-commerce marketplaces.\n\n“On the heels of volatile results in 2023, year-to-date results have been more predictable, and we continue to believe the opportunities remain vast,” analysts at financial firm William Blair told their clients in a Tuesday note, referring to the Payoneer results.\n\nMeanwhile, Denver-based Western Union reported third-quarter revenue slid 6% to $1.04 billion as an income contribution from Iraq decreased compared to the year-earlier period, according to an Oct. 23 press release. Still, the company’s net income for the quarter increased 55% to $264.8 million as its expenses decreased and its provision for taxes swung significantly.\n\nAs the 171-year-old company seeks to increase the appeal of its newer digital payments options, it’s making some progress, with that offering charting an 8% increase in revenue for the quarter. Still, it only makes up a quarter of revenue from its main consumer money transfer segment, which shrunk during the quarter.\n\nThe company’s consumer money transfer business accounts for 90% of its revenue while ancillary consumer services provide another 10%, the release said.",

      "# [Money Transfer Provider Is Again Impressing Funds by JUAN CARLOS ARANCIBIA, Juan-Carlos-Arancibia, Investor's Business Daily on 2025-01-02](https://www.investors.com/research/remitly-stock-best-stocks-to-watch/)\nRemitly Global (RELY) is not among the top five stocks in its industry group, and more funds shed the stock throughout 2024. Yet, the payment services provider is among the best stocks to watch, with its chart one of the best in the group.\n\nThe company is today's selection for IBD 50 Stocks To Watch, with the stock close to forming a three-weeks-tight pattern with a 23.11 buy point. The pattern acts a resting place after shares ran up more than 50% from a cup-with-handle breakout in late October. A move above 23.11 would signal an opportunity for those who already own Remitly to add shares, or for others to make an initial purchase.\n\n↑ X NOW PLAYING This Formula Can Help Protect Hard-Earned Gains And Give Winners Room To Run\n\nIBD MarketSurge shows the number of funds holding Remitly dwindled from 398 at the end of last March to 383 in June, 328 in September and 311 in December. But that trend could be reversing, based on more current fund data.\n\nRemitly has an A Accumulation/Distribution Rating and up/down volume ratio of 1.7. Both are bullish gauges of institutional-caliber buying in the past few months. No doubt, the stock's November rally drew fund managers back.\n\nBest Stocks To Watch: Remitly Raises Forecast\n\nThe breakout occurred after Remitly blew past analysts' estimates with a 39% jump in revenue for the third quarter and posted a non-GAAP profit of 20 cents a share, according to FactSet. The strong performance led management to raise its 2024 revenue and adjusted EBITDA forecast. Shares shot up 18% after the Oct. 30 report.\n\nThe Seattle-based company posted losses for much of 2022 and struggled to be profitable in 2023. Quarterly revenue growth, however, ranged from 31% to 50% since 2022, FactSet data shows.\n\nAnalysts' consensus estimate is for a 56% increase in 2025 earnings per share and 24% increase in 2025 revenue.\n\nRemitly specializes in helping people — many of them immigrants — send money abroad. It serves more than 7 million active customers, with more than $50 billion in transfers to some 170 countries.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nThe Four Pillars Of The IBD Methodology\n\nRisk Management In The Stock Market: How Much Money To Invest"
