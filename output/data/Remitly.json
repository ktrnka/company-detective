      "# [7 Surprising Facts You Need to Know About Guinea’s Currency by Growth Machine on 2024-07-22](https://blog.remitly.com/currencies/guinea-currency/)\nThe Guinean franc (GNF) is the official currency of the Republic of Guinea, a country in West Africa in the Guinea geographical region. Occasionally, it goes by the hyphenated name “Guinea-Conakry” to differentiate it from other nearby countries.\n\nAlthough many of Guinea’s neighbors use the West African CFA franc, Guinea has had its own currency since 1959. Before sending money to friends or family in Guinea, let’s brush up on the history of the Guinea franc, including its banknotes and coinage.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Guinea currency, and how to look up the real-time exchange rate using a currency converter.\n\nGuinea currency basics\n\nThe Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea is responsible for issuing the Guinea franc, with seven banknote denominations commonly seen in circulation:\n\n100 francs\n\n500 francs\n\n1,000 francs\n\n2,000 francs\n\n5,000 francs\n\n10,000 francs\n\n20,000 francs\n\nThere are also 25 franc and 50 franc banknotes, but these are less common due to their low value. As for coins, you’ll find 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 franc denominations.\n\nThe design of the Guinea franc changes with every issue, and there have been several commemorative editions to mark occasions like the 50th anniversary of the Guinea franc.\n\nThey all feature the Guinean coat of arms, as well as culturally significant images such as a banana harvest, Mount Nimba, the Kaleta hydroelectric dam, or a bauxite mine.\n\nIf you’re looking to exchange the Guinea franc for a foreign currency, you can use the currency code GNF to look it up on foreign exchange markets.\n\nWithin the country, you may see the abbreviations FG‎, Fr, or GFr to denote Guinean money.\n\nHistory of Guinea’s currency\n\nThe country that’s now Guinea has a shared history with other West African countries, with the Ghana, Mali, and Songhai empires all exerting their influence on the region from as early as the 3rd century.\n\nGold played a major role from the start, both for decorative purposes and as currency in the form of gold dust, wire, and nuggets.\n\nPortuguese traders established ports in the 15th century, and France claimed the territory as part of the French Empire in the late 1800s. The French military called the colony Rivières du Sud, meaning “southern rivers,” before changing the name to French Guinea.\n\nFrance introduced the CFA franc in 1945 to provide a common currency throughout its West and Central African territories, including Guinea. You’ll find other versions of this currency in countries like Senegal and Cameroon.\n\nAfter gaining its independence in 1958, the Republic of Guinea developed its own legal tender, and the first Guinea franc arrived on the scene in 1959.\n\n7 surprising facts about Guinean currency\n\nDue to its geographical location and natural resources, the Republic of Guinea has had a major role in the economy of the region—and an effect on other currencies of the world.\n\nHere are seven surprising facts about Guinea’s currency that you may not know:\n\n1. ‘Guinea’ is also the name of an old English coin.\n\nIf you hear someone mention a “Guinea coin” in a historical context, chances are they aren’t talking about the Guinea franc. The guinea is the name of a gold coin that was first minted in 1663 and used throughout the British Empire until 1814.\n\nSo, why was it called the guinea? They made the coin with gold from the Guinea region, and then it became the name of the coin itself.\n\nAt one point, a guinea was worth 21 shillings or 1.05 pounds. The guinea is no longer legal tender in the United Kingdom, but it was valid until Decimal Day in 1971, when decimalisation changed the way money was represented in the U.K. system.\n\n2. The Republic of Guinea previously used the CFA franc.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1958, Guinea used the French colonial currency, the CFA franc. After the end of the colonial period, the CFA franc evolved into two different currencies: the West African CFA franc and the Central African CFA franc.\n\nThese two currencies have the same value and are interchangeable in all 14 countries that use them. Since they’re pegged to the euro (EUR), they don’t float freely on global currency markets and have a fixed value of €1 to 655.957 CFA francs.\n\nThe Republic of Guinea, however, never joined the currency union that uses the CFA franc. It issues its own currency with its own free-floating exchange rate.\n\n3. There are no centimes in circulation.\n\nLike the CFA francs, one Guinea franc consists of 100 centimes—but you won’t find centimes anywhere in Guinea.\n\nThat’s because the value of the centime is so low that the Central Bank has never issued any denomination smaller than 1 GNF.\n\n4. Guinea briefly switched to the syli in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1971, the country introduced the syli, a currency made up of 100 cauris. Although the Central Bank issued syli coins and banknotes, at 10 francs to 1 syli, they didn’t last long: In 1985, Guinea switched back to the franc, with 1 franc equal to 1 syli.\n\n5. Guinea banknotes use the French language.\n\nIf you look at a Guinea banknote, you’ll notice that most of the writing is in French. For example, 20,000 francs is written as “vingt mille francs guinéens.”\n\nThis is because Guinea was a French territory until 1958. In fact, the official language of the Republic of Guinea is still French.\n\n6. A British printing house designed the early Guinean franc.\n\nDespite getting its name from French currency, several early print runs of the Guinean franc happened in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe iconic De La Rue printing house, which is the largest company of its kind in the world, designed an early set of banknotes.\n\nDe La Rue has worked with at least 140 countries and has designed over one-third of the world’s currency denominations.\n\n7. Guinean banknotes have numerous security features.\n\nIn addition to their beautiful designs, Guinean banknotes contain holographic patches, security strips, and other advanced features to prevent fraud.\n\nOver the years, these have included various watermarks, diamond-shaped patches, and the letters “RG” (Republic of Guinea) to denote their authenticity.\n\nUnderstanding Guinea franc exchange rates\n\nThe Guinea franc is a free-floating currency, which means its value fluctuates compared to other global currencies, such as the U.S. dollar (USD) or the Canadian dollar (CAD).\n\nIn recent years, Guinea’s economy has experienced high inflation—12.60% in 2021—but the country remains a major exporter of gold, bauxite, and other natural resources.\n\nIf you intend to travel to Guinea, you’ll likely want to take cash with you in your local currency and convert it to Guinea francs when you arrive, since ATMs have small withdrawal limits and credit card transactions are rare.\n\nYou can also use a money transfer service to send money to Guinea, with options for receiving funds via a bank deposit, mobile money, or cash pickup.\n\nSend money to Guinea from overseas\n\nWhen you need to send funds to loved ones in Guinea, Remitly makes it easy with a secure mobile app and transparent transaction fees.\n\nYou can send your transfer with a debit card or credit card and track it every step of the way.\n\nDownload the app, and we’ll show you how to get started today.\n\nFurther reading"

I have used this service for years sending money to family in the Philippines, I have done all they required sending a copy of my ID banking information.Recently I was treated Very disrespectfully for what reason??? None was given other than my service was terminated due to not following the rules. If sending money to pay bills buying food for the family, Christmas presents was against the terms of use it wasn’t on the list.\n   My account was closed . upon calling to resolve this unfortunate situation they was Rude stating I broke the rules, account closed, I can never have another account. I read the rules I hadn’t broke no rules.There  was no middle ground nothing I said mattered just fell on def ears and I was told again I broke the rules ??? This was absolutely absurd.. I never broke the rules I sent money to family for food bills every week to only one person then all a sudden ACCOUNT CLOSED for no good reason not even a good reason cause none was given just you broke the rules good bye that’s it and a RUDE good bye at best..\n    I see they try to write a retraction stating their willingness to help but to whom??? They always say our commitment to customer service is priority and stating the laws but it’s just a retraction.they just want people to read it thinking they want to help but they really don’t just trying to look good….CONFUSION FRUSTRATION…\n     That’s no help …I think they should state a clear reason with proof and allow an explanation before they terminate you..by law …they site laws when they want your ID and banking information I-Paid the taxes on this money I worked for it I earned it how I spend it is my business stick to the plan Remitly you are a service that relays on customers if you run them off how will you stay in business???",

I have used this service for years sending money to family in the Philippines, I have done all they required sending a copy of my ID banking information.Recently I was treated Very disrespectfully for what reason??? None was given other than my service was terminated due to not following the rules. If sending money to pay bills buying food for the family, Christmas presents was against the terms of use it wasn’t on the list.\n   My account was closed . upon calling to resolve this unfortunate situation they was Rude stating I broke the rules, account closed, I can never have another account. I read the rules I hadn’t broke no rules.There  was no middle ground nothing I said mattered just fell on def ears and I was told again I broke the rules ??? This was absolutely absurd.. I never broke the rules I sent money to family for food bills every week to only one person then all a sudden ACCOUNT CLOSED for no good reason not even a good reason cause none was given just you broke the rules good bye that’s it and a RUDE good bye at best..\n    I see they try to write a retraction stating their willingness to help but to whom??? They always say our commitment to customer service is priority and stating the laws but it’s just a retraction.they just want people to read it thinking they want to help but they really don’t just trying to look good….CONFUSION FRUSTRATION…\n     That’s no help …I think they should state a clear reason with proof and allow an explanation before they terminate you..by law …they site laws when they want your ID and banking information I-Paid the taxes on this money I worked for it I earned it how I spend it is my business stick to the plan Remitly you are a service that relays on customers if you run them off how will you stay in business???",

I put all my information in as they asked.  I have an excellent credit rating..  They paused the transfer and I had to speak with \"security\"..The man grilled me for over half and hour..who was I sending it to (a gift for Christmas) was he family (he was a fried) ?  What was he using it for? , what was my source of income? (I gave an answer..and also said I was retired).  Who was my previous employer?  Would I be sending money again etc.?  This was a major credit card.  I have an excellent credit rating. They wanted a PDF of my last bank statement which I did send in the end. He could have asked for that in the beginning instead of putting me through an interrogation.  I  later spoke with customer service to see if the pause could be released and she started talking about how they were doing this for my safety etc. sending money to someone I had never met..and  I said I had met this person.  I had visited him and his family in Brazil.  Where did she get that idea I had never met him?  Why was asking about my employment not an invasion of my privacy.  It was an absurd hour long struggle to finally get the money sent.  I told her I would never use Remitly ever again.  I plan to stick to that.  I will never use them nor recommend them.

You know what though? I am glad they closed my account because from now on I will give someone with better service my business.

Use a wire transfer instead. I tried sending money to buy A Colamburium to place my parents and that costs 7000 dollars and after giving them all the documents they cancelled my subscription for dubious activity. I guess they know what a Colamburium is, its where I can place my parents ashes inside a church.

I also asked that they refund the late fees incurred because of them and they did(in the form of a credit). I immediately used the credit and vowed not to use their service again.\n\n\n\nEDIT: I submitted complaints via the BBB and CFBP shortly after my original post.\n\nToday 1/12/2023 the status of the transaction magically changed from \"completed\" to on hold.\n\nI called and Remitly couldn't tell me why the transaction was on hold or why they had initially marked it as completed to begin with.\n\nAfter reconfirming that all the information was correct their resolution was to change the \"banking partner\" on the transaction to a different banking partner. I asked who the previous one was and who the new one would be and the rep said he couldn't share that info. Mind you I have been asking about these \"banking partners\" since the beginning because something about the whole thing seems fishy but Remitly won't share who these partners are and what they do exactly.\n\nAnyways instead of doing that I asked to cancel the transaction so I can get a refund. As soon as the money is back in my account I'm resending using my bank's wire transfer and I'm closing the Remitly account for good. I don't need these headaches in my life.\n\nTLDR; I sent a transaction of more than $3,000. Remitly didn't deliver the money but are claiming that they did. Every time I call they tell me they'll escalate the case and conduct an investigation. It's been 2 weeks and they keep telling me the same thing.\n\n\n\nOn 12/28/2023 1 initiated a transfer of $3154.57 from my US account to my international\n\naccount.\n\nOn 1/03/2024 I received a notification that the transfer had been completed. As of 1/10/2024, the money has not been delivered to the account.\n\nI have called Remitly on 8 different occations and have been told different stories about what's going on, including:\n\n* The transaction is complete and I'm incorrect\n* My bank is closed(lt's not)\n* Remitly is conducting an investigation and I'll hear back in 24 hours(l haven't)\n\nI have provived Remitly with copies of my official bank statement that clearly show the money was never received. Depending on who picks up the phone or chat, the Remitly rep states either of the following:\n\n* They spoke with my bank and my bank told them the money was deposited into my\n\naccount\n\n* They are doing an investigation(again)\n\nI have checked with my bank multiple times and they have told m e they have not been contacted by Remitly, and they have no received any funds from them so Remitly is clearly lying and refusing to provide any useful information. I have asked Remitly repeatedly to provide me with the emails they claim to have received from my bank stating the funds were deposited but they can't/won't. I have also asked to speak with the \"internal department\" conducting the investigation but have been told that I can't speak with them and that they will contact me once the investigation is completed.\n\nLast week I was told the investigation would be completed and I would get a resolution today 1/10/2024. When I called today I was told all of the above again and now they are\n\nsupposedly conducting a new investigation...\n\nI just filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau but other than that I don't know what I can do here.

Basically, if your full name and/or other information doesn't closely match, that could be part of the issue. Not saying it is, but very commonly people move and don't promptly update their state id / driver's license, etc. One is supposed to even if they just move down the street. While states generally don't enforce such stuff, it causes problems with automated verification many services use.\n\nIf your full name matches up and not moved at all, then something else triggered the review. Even how you accessed the website, such as through a VPN. Don't know if they have an app, but if using that, maybe had location turned off, which many sites utilize for additional fraud screening.\n\nBBB is a good start. See how that goes, but don't wait too long. If by end of week no progress, file a complaint with CFPB.\n\n## Comment ID khebnja with +1 score by [(Old_Gap_6174, Reddit, 2024-01-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Banking/comments/193cs4k/remitly_just_took_my_3000_dollars_what_can_i_do/khebnja/) (in reply to ID 193cs4k):\nHi u/notdoreen, I'm sorry to hear about the issues you're facing with Remitly.

When I created an account, they did nothing to verify my identity other than confirm my email.  They did nothing to confirm the accuracy or ownership of my bank account used for the transfer.  So security doesn't seem to be their strength.\n\nI also set up a Wise account.  When I wanted to do a transfer, they verify my email, they send 2FA verification codes with every sign-in.  They require more frequent sign-in and more frequent verification codes.  They require a picture of my identification and a selfie of myself.

This is what happened to me, so be careful with your reservations. \n\nLast week I received an email from \"noreply@booking.com\" containing all my reservation details and stating that I had to access a link to enter my card details in order to validate it.\n \nIf I had not entered my card details, I would have lost the reservation - it was also stated in this email. \n\nAfter entering and validating the payment (which was said to be refunded in a few seconds) nothing happened and then the person who obtained my card details tried to take money from my card again but I realized what was happening and refused a second payment. \n\nAt that point, from a \"support\" pop-up opened on the payment site I was asked what the available balance in the account was. \n\nIn the meantime I contacted both booking.com and the accommodation and received the following answers:\n\n- the hotel says they didn't receive any money from me, obviously\n- booking.com says they are very sorry about the situation, that the email did not come from them, that my private data was leaked and so the hackers could compose that email with my reservation details and I have to check with my bank to block my payment and get a refund.\n\n## Comment ID kj6a3lv with +166 score by [(lucapal1, Reddit, 2024-01-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/19dk51w/bookingcom_email_scam_fraud_card_validation/kj6a3lv/) (in reply to ID 19dk51w):\nThere have been a lot of posts on here about this, over the last few months.\n\nAnyway good to warn anyone who may still be unaware!\n\n### Comment ID kj7m0ga with +42 score by [(Expensive_Pin5399, Reddit, 2024-01-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/19dk51w/bookingcom_email_scam_fraud_card_validation/kj7m0ga/) (in reply to ID kj6a3lv):\nThese are hacked hotels.

Both however can send right from an app on your phone so you don't need to find one local to you to send.\n\nIf it's a large amount (eg more than you would want them carrying in cash) then a bank wire or some similar is probably the safest way, even though it'll cost you more up front.\n\n## Comment ID krz4tx2 with +1 score by [(Xiaomi12, Reddit, 2024-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1az4rx5/sending_money_from_us_to_vietnam/krz4tx2/) (in reply to ID 1az4rx5):\nWise is the best option, i use it all the time.\n\n## Comment ID krz8iqs with +1 score by [(vi3talogy, Reddit, 2024-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1az4rx5/sending_money_from_us_to_vietnam/krz8iqs/) (in reply to ID 1az4rx5):\nI use Remitly only $1.99 to transfer to their bank account and takes less then five minutes.\n\n### Comment ID krzazik with +1 score by [(Loose-Ad-1280, Reddit, 2024-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1az4rx5/sending_money_from_us_to_vietnam/krzazik/) (in reply to ID krz8iqs):\nWhen I was looking to use remitly I noticed it only asks for the recipients name, bank, and phone number.

He said you can basically just walk into any bank and withdraw the transfer but he normally uses BDO\n\n### Comment ID krevlai with +7 score by [(BanMeForNothing, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines_Expats/comments/1av98q0/atm_withdrawals_vs_remitly_or_wise_into_a/krevlai/) (in reply to ID kr9nbft):\nDont use Remitly. They charge a 3% fee (hidden in the spread) Use Wise which has low transparent fees.\n\n## Comment ID krd4ejz with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines_Expats/comments/1av98q0/atm_withdrawals_vs_remitly_or_wise_into_a/krd4ejz/) (in reply to ID 1av98q0):\nNothing beats paysend rn ..  right to gcash."

I have used this service for years sending money to family in the Philippines, I have done all they required sending a copy of my ID banking information.Recently I was treated Very disrespectfully for what reason??? None was given other than my service was terminated due to not following the rules. If sending money to pay bills buying food for the family, Christmas presents was against the terms of use it wasn’t on the list.\n   My account was closed . upon calling to resolve this unfortunate situation they was Rude stating I broke the rules, account closed, I can never have another account. I read the rules I hadn’t broke no rules.There  was no middle ground nothing I said mattered just fell on def ears and I was told again I broke the rules ??? This was absolutely absurd.. I never broke the rules I sent money to family for food bills every week to only one person then all a sudden ACCOUNT CLOSED for no good reason not even a good reason cause none was given just you broke the rules good bye that’s it and a RUDE good bye at best..\n    I see they try to write a retraction stating their willingness to help but to whom??? They always say our commitment to customer service is priority and stating the laws but it’s just a retraction.they just want people to read it thinking they want to help but they really don’t just trying to look good….CONFUSION FRUSTRATION…\n     That’s no help …I think they should state a clear reason with proof and allow an explanation before they terminate you..by law …they site laws when they want your ID and banking information I-Paid the taxes on this money I worked for it I earned it how I spend it is my business stick to the plan Remitly you are a service that relays on customers if you run them off how will you stay in business???",

Also, when I send bigger amounts they try to get more private information like SS# and birthdate. During those times, I go to XOOM.com for immediate services.

As required by state and federal law, and to keep our system safe, we are required to verify your identity and keep certain information that you provide to us, consistent with our Privacy Policy.\n\nCustomer Identification Requirements. To comply with obligations of applicable anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws, we may be required to obtain, verify, and record identifying information about you. To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, we may require that you provide us with nonpublic, personal, identifying information. We may also lawfully obtain information about you from other sources.\n\nAuthorization. You authorize us to make any inquiries, to you or to others, that we determine are reasonably necessary to validate the information that you provide to us. We reserve the right to request additional information from you to verify your identity against third-party databases or through other sources, and to require you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address or Payment Instrument.\n\n6. SENDING A TRANSACTION\n\nGeneral. Using your Remitly Account, you can send money to a Recipient by providing us with information about you and a Recipient. You can send money to a Recipient, and a Recipient can receive funds sent by you, even if they do not have a Remitly Account or use the Service.\n\nProcessing Your Transactions. If you submit a Transaction, you are requesting that we process that Transaction. For you to initiate a Transaction through the Service and for us to process a Transaction on your behalf, you must provide us with information about a valid Payment Instrument that you want to use to fund your Transaction through your Remitly Account. If we are unable to process your Transaction using the Payment Instrument you select, we will notify you and request that you choose another Payment Instrument to complete your transaction. You agree that we may accept or reject your offer to process your Transaction under the terms of this Agreement. We are not under any obligation to carry out any Transaction that you request if, for example, you have broken any of your obligations set out in this Agreement.\n\nBank Account Payment Authorization. When you fund a Transaction and/or pay any Service Fees using your bank account as the Payment Instrument, you authorize the initiation of ACH debit or credit entries, as applicable, to that bank account in accordance with any payment instructions you provide, and the crediting of funds to your bank account for Transactions that are refunded, canceled or otherwise returned.\n\nCard Payment Authorization. When you fund a Transaction and/or pay any Service Fees using a credit or debit card, you authorize us, for the purpose of processing your Transaction, to debit or charge that Payment Instrument to fund the Transaction by the amount you specify, plus any Service Fees, and to send those funds to the designated Recipient immediately upon our receipt of the Transaction. You can withdraw your authorization for us to charge your debit or credit card by removing it from your Remitly Account. If your payment fails, you authorize us to re-try one or more times using the same debit or credit card, subject to limitations under applicable law.\n\nRemitly’s Liability. When you send a Transaction through our Service, it is your responsibility to make sure that all the Transaction details are complete, accurate, and correct (including, without limitation, the Recipient’s information and the Recipient’s banking or other account details) as we may not be able to let you change the details of your Transaction once it is submitted to us for processing.\n\nTo the extent allowed by law, you agree to be bound by all payment instructions or Transactions that are initiated through the Service from your Remitly Account. You must make sure that all payment instructions for your Transactions are correct and accurate.\n\nYou are solely responsible for entering the correct information for the Recipient to whom you are sending money. Subject to applicable law, you, not Remitly, are responsible for any amounts that are transferred to the incorrect person because you entered incorrect information related to the Recipient for a Transaction.\n\nSubject to limitations under applicable law, Remitly shall not be liable for a failure to complete Transactions in the following circumstances:\n\nyour payment instructions contain inaccurate instructions, mistakes, or insufficient information; or\n\nyour chosen Payment Instrument does not have sufficient funds to pay for a Transaction you initiate through the Service.\n\n7. PAYING FOR THE SERVICE\n\nOur Service Fee. In consideration for providing you with our Service, you agree to pay us a service fee (a \"Service Fee\") for each Transaction you submit, in addition to the Transaction Amount. Details on the discrete Service Fee amount related to a specific Transaction will be made available to you in our Mobile App or website before you give us your consent to execute your Transaction. Payment in US dollars is due and payable by you to us at the time the Transaction is submitted for processing. Service Fees may vary based on Recipient country and other factors and are subject to change.\n\nOther Charges. We are not responsible for fees that may be imposed by financial institutions associated with your Payment Instruments. For example, some credit card issuers may treat the use of your credit card to use the Service as a \"cash advance\" and may impose additional fees and interest costs for the transaction. Remitly is not responsible for any non-sufficient funds fees (“NSF Fees”), chargeback fees, or other, similar charges that might be imposed on you by your bank, credit card issuer, or other provider. If you submit a Transaction that results in Remitly being charged a fee or another amount because of your Payment Instrument not being used in an authorized manner, or with insufficient funds or credit, we will notify you of the fee we were charged, and you agree to pay us the equivalent amount.\n\nForeign Currency Exchange. We and our Service Providers (defined below) may make money when you pay for a Transaction in one currency and the Transaction is paid out in another currency because of the difference between the exchange rate at which we buy foreign currency and the exchange rate provided to you at the time of your Transaction. Exchange rates may vary based on Recipient country and other factors and are subject to change. If a foreign currency exchange rate applies to a Transaction that you request, it will be disclosed to you before you authorize the Transaction.\n\nThird-Party Fees and Charges. When you use our Service, other third parties may level fees, costs, or other liabilities against you. These third-parties may include your bank, card issuer, phone provider, or internet service provider. For example, your phone and/or internet service provider may charge you fees relating to data or messaging services. You (and not Remitly) are responsible for any fees, charges, costs, and/or expenses charged by such third parties in connection with your use of our Service. Please check your agreements with these third-party providers for details on any of these additional costs.\n\n8. RECEIVING A REMITTANCE\n\nService Providers. We work with local banks and other third-party outlets (each, a \"Service Provider\") to make funds available to Recipients. We try to provide current information on our website about the location, availability, and hours of our Service Providers. Please note that these may be subject to change without our knowing, and we are not responsible for any inaccurate or incomplete information that may be posted on the website.\n\nVerification of Recipients. Recipients may be required to provide information, such as a valid identification, to verify their identities to our Service Providers before receiving funds. Recipients may also be required to provide a reference number or another similar identifier associated with the applicable Transactions.\n\nExpired Transactions. We will cancel Transactions where funds are made available to Recipients by way of cash pick-up if the funds are not validly collected within 60 calendar days of when they were first made available. To the extent possible for these expired transactions, we will refund the full Transaction Amount, taxes, and any Service Fees that you paid as part of the Transaction. If we are unable to return the funds to this Payment Instrument after a legally required time has passed, the funds will be escheated to the applicable state.\n\n9. IMPORTANT SERVICE RESTRICTIONS\n\nOur Right to Limit Your Use of Our Service. In addition to the limitations described elsewhere in this Agreement, we may refuse to process any Transaction in our sole discretion where we have a reasonable belief or a reasonable basis to believe, that it is necessary to protect you and/or us or when it is otherwise required so that we may comply with legal or regulatory requirements. You agree that we may also limit the amount to be transferred, either on a per transaction or aggregated basis. These limits may be imposed on individual Remitly Accounts or specific Payment Instruments in your Remitly Account. We also reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue all or any part of the Service.\n\nDelays. We have the sole discretion to delay your Transaction, in accordance with applicable law, to verify your identity, validate your Payment Instrument, manage our financial risk, or if we believe that the Transaction may involve fraud or that a crime or violation of law, rule, or regulation has occurred, is occurring, or may occur. Depending on the reason for a delay or a failure to make the funds available to the Recipient, you may be entitled to a refund or other remedies in certain circumstances.\n\nTransfer Speed. Any transfer speed information or estimates for any of your Transactions that we provide to you on our website or in our Mobile App are estimates of the delivery date and time based on payment method, delivery method, transaction review, and system availability of Remitly, our partners and Service Providers. In addition to any transfer speed information and estimates we provide during the send process, before you submit a Transaction, and in your Transaction receipt, we will provide you with an exact date and time when you can expect your money to be delivered to your Recipient.\n\nCommercial Transactions. We are not responsible for the quality or delivery of goods or services for which you pay a Recipient by using the Service. You accept that using the Service to transfer funds for payments for goods and services is at your own risk.\n\nIneligibility. To comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may refuse Transactions from certain Senders and to certain Recipients that are included on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list, Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories list, and such other lists as issued by different government agencies.\n\nNo Changes. We generally do not let you change the details of your Transaction once it is submitted to us for processing. It is your responsibility to make sure your Transaction details are accurate. Pursuant to Section 6.5 and other Sections of this Agreement, you, and not Remitly, shall be responsible for any incorrect information or mistakes that you make when entering information about the Recipient for a Transaction. Nothing in this Agreement, however, shall be construed to limit your rights with respect to canceling Transactions or asserting an error with respect to a Transaction under applicable law.\n\nProhibited Activities.

Completion of your Transaction means that your recipient has picked up the funds you sent for cash pick-up or the funds have been deposited into the Recipient’s bank account at the time of your cancellation request. Upon receipt of a cancellation request, we will confirm whether the transaction has been completed, which may include communicating with our Service Providers to determine whether the transaction has been completed prior to initiating a refund. Remitly’s ability to stop or cancel a Transaction depends on the method you select to disburse the funds to your Recipient and the time when you submit your cancellation request.

During this period, You and Remitly agree that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled.

Failure to comply with the Claim Notice requirement is grounds for dismissal of any arbitration or small-claim action.\n\nAgreement to Arbitrate. YOU AND REMITLY AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM WILL BE RESOLVED BY INDIVIDUAL, BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU AND REMITLY THEREBY EACH AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND AGREE THAT YOU AND WE MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. The party pursuing arbitration will initiate such arbitration in JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider. Information regarding JAMS may be found on its website at https://www.jamsadr.com/. You and Remitly also agree that any dispute as to the applicability of this Section 19, the arbitrability of a Claim, or the scope or enforceability of this Section 19 will be decided by the arbitrator.\n\nThe rules governing any arbitration between You and Remitly will depend on the amount in controversy. For Claims between You and Remitly where the total value of all Claims (including attorneys’ fees to the extent provided under applicable law) exceeds $250,000, the arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures. A Copy of JAMS’ Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures is available at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.

However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow the terms as a court would. For the avoidance of doubt, the arbitrator can award public injunctive relief if authorized by law and warranted by the individual claim(s).\n\na. Mass Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that more than 75 consumers, represented by the same, related, or coordinate attorney or law firm, initiate arbitrations against Remitly which raise similar or related Claims, the Claims shall be administered as a mass arbitration under the JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines (Procedures).

Costs and Fees Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the applicable JAMS rules, subject to any state limitations on arbitration costs. If you prevail in arbitration you may be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Remitly will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Claim or the relief sought to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.\n\nf. Federal Arbitration Act. You and Remitly agree that this Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and therefore the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.) applies including its procedural provisions, in all respects.

To achieve this, our ethos is to do good with what we’re good at—tackling the challenges we are uniquely positioned to solve through our products, business practices, and in partnerships with our people and global communities.\n\nA few highlights across each of our impact priorities:\n\nFinancial Inclusion and Innovation In 2023, Remitly connected communities across borders by facilitating nearly $40 billion in transactions, at costs that are rapidly approaching— and in many cases achieving—the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal of 3%. Additionally, we are proud to offer our services in 17 languages, connecting customers to over 4.2 billion bank accounts, over 1.2 billion mobile wallets, and approximately 460,000 cash pick-up options worldwide.\n\nSecure and Ethical TransactionsWe’re committed to building trusted financial products that protect our customers and deliver secure and ethical transactions. In Q4 2023, over 95% of transactions on our platform required no customer support, and our total transaction losses (including fraud, chargebacks, and other disbursement losses) represented just 0.10% of our total 2023 send volume and just 0.15% in the previous year.\n\nCustomer-centric, Inclusive, and Diverse Global CultureAt Remitly, our global teams are united by a shared commitment to serving our customers. We believe that building a diverse and inclusive culture enables us to better understand and meet the needs of our customers around the world. In 2023, Remitly’s 12 global affinity groups promoted continuous education on DEI topics, resulting in 81% of Remitly employees feeling a sense of belonging. We also continued to invest in the Remitly Scholars program, which enables Remitly employees to fund scholarships for students at two major universities in the Philippines. Since launching the program in 2015, we have provided scholarships amounting to more than $800,000 in total financial support.\n\nProtect People, Our Operations, and the PlanetWe are dedicated to protecting people, our operations, and the planet, and recognize that climate-related risks are increasing for the customers and communities we serve. In 2023, we supported people in climate-vulnerable areas by expanding the accessibility of funds and responding to natural disasters in five countries, providing over $50,000 in fee-free transfers or discounts.\n\nExtending our Global Impact with PhilanthropyIn 2023, we donated a combined $600,000 through Remitly and employee giving, Remitly fee-free transfers and discounts, and grants made through Remitly Foundation. Our giving was primarily focused on two key impact areas: advancing financial inclusion, and increasing community resilience for refugees, immigrants, and their families around the world. Remitly employees also volunteered over 1,100 hours in support of over 250 nonprofits that champion local and global causes they are passionate about.\n\nAs you read this report, we hope you will be inspired by what we’ve been able to accomplish together, and that you’ll join us in our work to transform lives across borders with trusted financial services.\n\nTo read the full Global Impact Report and learn more about our progress and future initiatives, visit Remitly.com.\n\nRemitly is proud to announce the launch of our second annual Global Impact Report, highlighting the progress we made in 2023 toward our global impact vision to transform lives across borders by creating financial inclusion and strengthening community resilience.\n\nThis vision reflects the positive impact that our products can have on the customers and communities we serve, as well as our responsibility to protect people, our operations, and the planet for the long term.

(NASDAQ: RELY), a trusted provider of digital financial services that transcend borders, reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“I am grateful to our customers and global teams for the exceptional third quarter results,” said Matt Oppenheimer, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Remitly. “As our performance in the third quarter exceeded expectations, we are pleased to increase our 2024 outlook for both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. We are excited about growth opportunities in 2025 and beyond as we execute on our vision of transforming lives with trusted financial services that transcend borders.”\n\nThird Quarter 2024 Highlights and Key Operating Data\n\n(All comparisons relative to the third quarter of 2023)\n\nActive customers increased to 7.3 million, from 5.4 million, up 35%.\n\nSend volume increased to $14.5 billion, from $10.2 billion, up 42%.\n\nRevenue totaled $336.5 million, compared to $241.6 million, up 39%.\n\nNet income was $1.9 million, compared to net loss of $35.7 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $46.7 million, compared to $10.5 million, up 345%.\n\n2024 Financial Outlook\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, Remitly currently expects:\n\nTotal revenue in the range of $1.250 billion to $1.254 billion, representing a growth rate of 32% to 33% year over year. This outlook reflects an increase from our prior revenue outlook in the range of $1.230 billion to $1.250 billion.\n\nTo remain in a GAAP net loss position for 2024 and for Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $108 million to $112 million. This outlook reflects an increase from our prior Adjusted EBITDA outlook in the range of $90 million and $100 million.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, Remitly currently expects:\n\nTotal revenue in the range of $338 million to $342 million, representing a growth rate of 28% to 29% year over year.\n\nA GAAP net loss position for the fourth quarter of 2024 and for Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $17 million to $21 million.\n\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this earnings release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” We have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of forecasted Adjusted EBITDA to forecasted GAAP net income (loss) or to forecasted GAAP income (loss) before income taxes within this earnings release because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, calculate certain reconciling items with confidence due to the variability, complexity, and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from forecasted Adjusted EBITDA. These items include, but are not limited to, income taxes and stock-based compensation expense, which are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. The variability of these items could have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\nNote: All percentage changes described within this press release are calculated using amounts in the Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), for which revenue and active customers are presented in thousands and send volume is presented in millions. Rounding differences may occur when individually calculating percentages or totals from rounded amounts included within the press release body as compared to the amounts included within the Company’s SEC filings.\n\nWebcast Information\n\nRemitly will host a webcast at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, October 30, 2024 to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results. The live webcast and investor presentation will be accessible on Remitly’s website at https://ir.remitly.com. A webcast replay will be available on our website at https://ir.remitly.com following the live event.\n\nWe have used, and intend to continue to use, the Investor Relations section of our website at https://ir.remitly.com as a means of disclosing material nonpublic information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nSome of the financial information and data contained in this earnings release, such as Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expenses, have not been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We regularly review our key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our performance, identify trends affecting our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information for management and investors in assessing our historical and future operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expenses are key output measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance, inform future operating plans, and make strategic long-term decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources. Remitly believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expenses provides additional tools to assess operational performance and trends in, and in comparing Remitly’s financial measures with, other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Remitly’s non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Because of the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures, you should consider the non-GAAP financial measures presented herein in conjunction with Remitly’s financial statements and the related notes thereto. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in this press release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted by (i) interest (income) expense, net, (ii) provision for income taxes, (iii) noncash charges of depreciation and amortization, (iv) gains and losses from the remeasurement of foreign currency assets and liabilities into their functional currency, (v) noncash charges associated with our donation of common stock in connection with our Pledge 1% commitment, (vi) noncash stock-based compensation expense, net, and (vii) certain acquisition, integration, restructuring, and other costs. We calculate non-GAAP operating expenses as our GAAP operating expenses adjusted by (i) noncash stock-based compensation expense, net, (ii) noncash charges associated with our donation of common stock in connection with our Pledge 1% commitment, as well as (iii) certain acquisition, integration, restructuring, and other costs.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future operating results and financial position, including our fiscal year 2024 financial outlook, including forecasted fiscal year 2024 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, anticipated future expenses and investments, expectations relating to certain of our key financial and operating metrics, our business strategy and plans, market growth, our market position and potential market opportunities, and our objectives for future operations. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “potential,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “could,” “would,” “project,” “plan,” “target,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s expectations, assumptions, and projections based on information available at the time the statements were made. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including risks and uncertainties related to our ability to successfully execute our business and growth strategy, our ability to achieve and maintain future profitability, our ability to further penetrate our existing customer base and expand our customer base in existing and new corridors, our ability to expand into broader financial services, our ability to expand internationally, the effects of seasonal trends on our results of operations, the current inflationary environment, our expectations concerning relationships with third parties, including strategic, banking, and disbursement partners, our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our ability to maintain the security and availability of our solutions, the success of any acquisitions or investments that we make, our ability to compete effectively, our ability to stay in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, our ability to buy foreign currency at generally advantageous rates, and the effects of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, including regulatory changes, on our customers and business operations. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Further information on risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from forecasted results is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 to be filed with the SEC, and within our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC, which are or will be available on our website at https://ir.remitly.com and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

      "# [11 Common Money Transfer Scams and How to Avoid Them by Evelyne Kuo on 2024-08-08](https://blog.remitly.com/money-transfer/money-transfer-scams/)\nPeople send hundreds of billions of dollars in remittances every year. And sadly, because of this volume, certain scammers try to trick people through different money transfer scams.\n\nHere at Remitly, we want to help you understand how these money transfer scams work and recognize the warning signs of potential fraud so you can keep your money safe.\n\n11 Common Money Transfer Scams\n\nAs people become better at recognizing fraudulent activities, such as credit card theft and wire transfer fraud, scammers are also improving their methods.\n\nSince tracing many of these scams might be complicated, your best protection is learning to spot potential fraudulent acts when you encounter them.\n\nThese are some of the most common scams we encounter here at Remitly as we work tirelessly to keep our customers’ information safe.\n\nPlease note, if you send a transfer to a scammer, we might not be able to help, and you could lose your money.\n\n1. Family emergency scams\n\nIn this type of scam, the victim is led to believe that they are sending funds to help a loved one or friend in an emergency situation.\n\nScammers exploit the victim’s natural worry for someone they care about. This can involve a car accident, being stranded at an airport, or avoiding arrest‌.\n\nThe scammer may place an urgent phone call, posing as a relative, friend, or loved one or as a figure of authority such as a law enforcement official or medical doctor.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nVerify the emergency by contacting the loved one or friend directly.\n\nDo not rush the transaction. Take time to verify the situation.\n\nBe suspicious of requests for secrecy or urgency.\n\nBe wary of unsolicited calls or messages from unknown individuals.\n\n2. Extortion scams\n\nAn extortion scam involves the act of obtaining an individual’s property, assets, or money through threatened or actual force, violence, and intimidation. Sextortion is a type of extortion where a perpetrator threatens to expose sexually compromising information, such as sexually explicit private images or videos of the victim, unless the victim meets certain demands, usually money.\n\nVictims tend to be younger adults or elders.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nBe cautious about who you connect with on social media and dating sites.\n\nDo not engage in explicit video chat or exchange sexually explicit images with strangers.\n\nDo not send money to someone who is threatening to expose intimate photos or videos.\n\nBe wary of false communication from law enforcement officials.\n\n3. Threats/Blackmail scams\n\nThreats/blackmail scams involve scammers unlawfully obtaining money from a victim through coercion. The scammer threatens to harm the victim if they do not cooperate.\n\nThe scammer may relate personal information in the email or call to add intimidation. They may threaten physical harm, claim to know where you live or work, and threaten to hurt you or your loved ones unless you pay up.\n\nScammers may also threaten the victim with arrest or jail time if they do not comply with the demands.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nDo not comply with the scammer’s demands.\n\nContact law enforcement immediately if you feel threatened or scared.\n\nBe wary of unsolicited calls or messages from unknown individuals.\n\nBe cautious about sharing personal information online or in response to unsolicited calls or messages.\n\n4. Imposter scams\n\nIn an imposter scam, a scammer poses as an authoritative individual and requests money to sort out a false situation.\n\nScammers may also pose as representatives from a reputable business (business impersonators), or financial institutions and make false claims of fraudulent charges that need to be reviewed or refunded or as overpayments to steal from the victim.\n\nThey make false claims about fraudulent charges and bank transfers, refunds, shipment issues, or other bogus fees that will cause the victim to share personal and/or financial information. Scammers may even hack the customer’s phone in order to process unauthorized transactions.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nBe cautious about sharing personal information online or in response to unsolicited calls or messages.\n\nVerify the legitimacy of the representative or business.\n\nDo not share financial information over the phone or email.\n\nDo not trust unsolicited communication from unknown individuals or businesses.\n\n5. Investment scams\n\nInvestment scams often sound “too good to be true” or offer “risk-free” investment opportunities. They pressure victims to invest immediately, sometimes indicating the opportunity is for a limited time.\n\nThe victim is often lured through social media apps or cold calls/email inquiries.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nBe cautious of investment opportunities that sound too good to be true or pressure you to invest immediately.\n\nDo your research and verify the legitimacy of the investment before investing any money.\n\nDo not invest money you cannot afford to lose.\n\n6. Romance scams\n\nIn a romance scam, the victim is tricked into thinking they’ve found true love online. Scammers play with your emotions, pretending to be interested in a romantic relationship. They use flattering words and stolen pictures to win trust and affection.\n\nOnce they have the victim hooked, they ask for money or gift cards. They might claim it’s for a plane ticket to meet up or to cover unexpected medical expenses. They prey on the desire for love and companionship, making it hard to say no.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nVerify the person’s identity by doing a reverse image search or asking for a video call.\n\nBe suspicious of requests for secrecy or urgency, as scammers often use these tactics.\n\nBe cautious of unsolicited messages or calls from strangers professing love or interest.\n\n7. Tech support scams\n\nTech support scams involve scammers posing as representatives from reputable companies like Microsoft or Apple and claiming that the victim’s computer requires tech services in order to gain access remotely and steal from the customer.\n\nTypically, victims receive an unsolicited phone call, text message, or email from an individual claiming to represent a company’s “Tech Support,” “Help Desk,” “IT Department,” or a similar office.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nRemember that reputable companies will never contact you out of the blue and ask for access to your computer.\n\nNever provide personal or financial information to unsolicited callers or email senders.\n\nIndependently verify the legitimacy of any request for tech support services.\n\n8. Immigration scams\n\nIf you receive a call from someone claiming to be an immigration official, it’s okay to feel suspicious immediately. Scammers may call you and claim there’s a problem with your immigration documents that you can solve by making an immediate money transfer or providing your account information.\n\nThey may even provide personal information or make threats of deportation, but you should never give out personal financial information.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nRemember that the USCIS and the government will never ask you to transfer money to an individual. You can only pay any fees on the USCIS online portal or Pay.gov.\n\nDon’t provide any personal or financial information to people you don’t trust.\n\nBe sure to contact USCIS directly if you need help with any immigration processes.\n\nUnfortunately, you may come across other scams as the methods change frequently. Learning to recognize general warning signs of scams can help you stay safe.\n\n9. Prize scams\n\nWith the prize wire money and transfer scam, criminals attempt to steal money with phony sweepstakes, lotteries, or contests. Usually, the scam begins with an unexpected email or phone call saying that you won a cash prize in another country.\n\nThe scammer might ask for your bank account information so that they can directly deposit the winnings and then use the information to conduct fraudulent activity with your bank account.\n\nAnother version of the scam works similarly to some other money and wire transfer scams. The fraudsters send a fake check to the victim and then tell the victim to wire money to them to cover fees like currency conversion or processing fees.\n\nAfter you deposit the check and transfer or wire money, you find the check fake. You may be subject to fees from your bank and be out the transferred or wired money.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nResearch any unfamiliar contests or sweepstakes before wiring money.\n\nNever initiate money or wire transfers until you’re certain checks have cleared.\n\nCall the issuing bank of any check received to verify funds and authenticity.\n\nNever give your bank account information to an unknown party.\n\n10. Job scams\n\nA job scam is when a fraudster advertises a fake job, such as a secret shopper position or work-from-home opportunity, through social media, fake websites, and even roadside signs.\n\nWhen you express interest in the job, the scammer may put you through a fake interview process, asking you to answer questions and provide personal information.\n\nThen, they’ll tell you that you’re hired but explain that you need to transfer or wire money to cover processing fees to enroll you in their work-from-home program, to pay for necessary equipment, or to complete a mandatory training course.\n\nYou only find out that the job was fake all along after the money’s been sent.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nCheck the Better Business Bureau and state business registration records to confirm the validity of companies.\n\nBe wary of sending money for any employment opportunity.\n\nUse caution for any job offer that seems too good to be true.\n\n11. Marketplace scams\n\nMarketplace schemes seek to take advantage of people buying and selling things through Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, eBay, and other sites.\n\nThere are two versions of this scam. With the first, a fake buyer asks if they can pay for an item via money order, personal check, or cashier’s check.\n\nIf the seller says yes, the buyer sends a fake check or money order for more than the sale price. The buyer will then ask the seller to transfer or wire the extra money back to them. After they go through with wiring or transferring money, the check turns out to be bad.\n\nFake sellers can also try to perpetrate this money or wire transfer scam. With this version, a fraudster lists an appealing item for sale on a marketplace site.\n\nIf you express interest, they will ask you to send money or a wire transfer and tell you they will ship the item after receiving the funds.\n\nOnce you wire money to them, they will contact you and say there is a problem. Most often, fake sellers will claim that they didn’t receive money and ask you to provide the money transfer control number so that they can track the payment. If you give them this number, they will pick up cash and never send the purchased item.\n\nA common marketplace scam is called a fake check scam in which the scammer requests the recipient to cash a check for a purchase or service and then asks to wire part of the funds back to cover certain expenses.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nDon’t accept a personal check, money order, or cashier’s check when selling things online.\n\nOnly process transactions through sales platforms, being wary of anyone who asks you to go outside the system to avoid fees.\n\nCheck reviews and ratings for buyers and sellers.\n\nNever agree to wire money to pay for something that you buy through an online marketplace.\n\nCommon signs of financial scams\n\nNot sure whether something is a scam? Watch out for these red flags:\n\nThey insist on handling everything by email, text, or social media messages.\n\nThere are misspellings or serious grammar issues in communications.\n\nThe return email address is strange or unrecognized.\n\nThey put pressure on you to send money quickly.\n\nThey ask you to send money to a foreign country even though they claim to be in the U.S.\n\nYou’re asked to use cashier’s checks, wire transfers, or other potentially untraceable funds.\n\nStaying safe from money transfer scams\n\nFollow these steps to safeguard your money and your information:\n\nNever give out personal information on an unsolicited call or message.\n\nDon’t send money to someone you don’t know personally.\n\nContact family members at known phone numbers if you receive an unfamiliar request from them.\n\nRegularly update your passwords.\n\nInstall blockers for pop-ups and antivirus software.\n\nDo not share your login information for Remitly, online banking information, or login credentials for other financial apps.\n\nReport money and wire transfer scams\n\nIf you discover that someone has stolen funds from you, act quickly by contacting Remitly or the wire transfer provider you used. In some cases, it may be possible to recover your hard-earned money.\n\nEven if a fraudster was unsuccessful in committing money transfer or wire fraud because you caught onto the scheme, you should report the attempt. The Federal Trade Commission offers a detailed guide on how to report wire transfer scams that you can access here.\n\nAlthough criminals do try to exploit the wire transfer system to their advantage, wire and money transfers are still a convenient way to send money to your loved ones located abroad. By following the tips outlined in this article, you can do so more safely and protect yourself from fraud.",

As a leading digital financial services provider for immigrants and their families, Remitly is committed to transforming lives that transcend borders, and we further this impact through initiatives that engage global communities in meaningful ways. Last year, Remitly and its employees supported over 200 global nonprofits through giving and volunteering, many of which focused on supporting immigrants and their families.\n\nIn addition, over the last several years, Remitly has supported non-profit organizations serving immigrants in North America via partnerships, community events, and other programs. In line with this commitment, in 2023 Remitly collaborated with TeamSnap, an app utilized by sports organizations to stay connected with players and their families, to sponsor local sports leagues in Miami along with their annual Coach of the Year award. This player-nominated award honors exceptional youth soccer coaches who have transformed the lives of their teams. Winning teams receive funding which can be used to support team costs including equipment, uniforms, or grants to cover team registration fees for families in need.\n\nTeamSnap’s 2023 Coach of the Year award honored Gabor Pasztor, owner of Athletic Club Miami in South Florida. As a decorated international athlete and a Hungarian immigrant, Gabor shared how his belief in the transformative power of sports led him to open Athletic Club Miami and inspired a passion for positively impacting the lives of young players.\n\nA decorated past\n\nFor Gabor, a passion for sports runs deep—both of his parents were Olympic gymnasts in Hungary and, as a child, he quickly followed in their footsteps until age 11. Gabor was seen playing soccer by a coach near a local school and was invited to a soccer league where he excelled; six years later, he was offered a contract to play professionally with a Division Three soccer club.\n\n“I was only 18 and I found myself at a crossroads. My college did not allow me to play at my pro club for money, so if I wanted to continue my education I had to leave my adult club and join the college soccer team,” he recalls. “During my first year in college, the track coaches invited me to some running events to help the school; it went so well that I moved into the track program with the promise that if everything went well one day, I could make it to the national team.” At the time, Gabor was attending school, competing in track, and coaching twice a week. “I wanted to achieve academically and continue to compete on a high level,” Gabor says.\n\nWhile in college, Gabor received the offer of his dreams: a place on the National Track Team. He traveled to Istanbul, Turkey to represent Hungary at his first European Cup event in 2008. Gabor rediscovered his love of soccer when he immigrated to Miami in 2012, working as a coach for an afterschool youth soccer team. With close to 60% of Miami’s population being born in a different country and soccer being one of the most popular sports in the world, Gabor saw an opportunity to make his mark by creating his own club, especially as a seasoned coach and athlete. “I had seen how the best soccer coaches work, and what systems work best,” he says. “I saw what could be better and what the parents were looking for, and I followed my instincts.”\n\nBuilding the American Dream\n\nAfter two months of working at the afterschool program as a coach, Gabor set plans to establish his own club in motion. “As an employee, I was able to gain some insights into how the business works without any risk,” he says. Without any upfront investment or marketing budget, Gabor personally distributed thousands of flyers in his neighborhood. “At the time, I lived in a 52-floor skyscraper and went to every floor via the stairs because I didn’t want to wait for the elevator,” he recalls. “I went to a neighboring building next door with 44 floors and did the same thing. I squatted down and slid flyers to every apartment on my own.”\n\nHis dedication paid off, and soon, he had seven children on his first team. However, he didn’t stop there—Gabor also created a non-profit arm of his company, awarding scholarships to families who can’t afford the full membership cost. “Many of my players and their families are from Latin America, and a lot of them just started their life here,” he says.\n\nA bridge between two worlds\n\nFor many immigrants, soccer offers a sense of community and connection when far from home. Gabor’s team has both first and second-generation immigrants, who each face their own set of challenges. “Many of my players were born here and understand American culture more than their parents, but a lot of them moved to America at a young age,” he says. “They still have language barriers like I had, and some cultural surprises that come up.” For the teammates, being a part of Athletic Club Miami offers a sense of belonging, especially in a new environment. “The camaraderie the players build is an important thing,” he says. “My players are meeting with other soccer players within our club on birthdays and holidays. Their friendships become stronger because of these shared experiences on and off the field.”\n\nThe feeling of community extends beyond the players and to their families, too. Gabor recalls a time when some parents pooled money for a few of his players who couldn’t afford a team trip to Europe. “These parents knew some of the players couldn’t afford the trip, but donated money because they knew the kids worked really hard for over two years,” he says. “The sacrifices these parents make for the team are amazing. Everyone is always looking out and helping each other.”\n\nGabor, who describes his coaching style as a “tough love” approach rooted in discipline and rigor, sets high expectations for his students. “To excel in a sport at a high level, you need to work a lot and change your lifestyle. I see my kids want to get better, and it’s great to see how these changes affect other areas of their lives,” he says. “They start to think about eating better, they’re going to sleep earlier, and they start to read more to learn about soccer or their other interests. They learn how to become better physically and mentally.”\n\nGabor embodies his approach in the Club’s motto: “More than a practice, it’s a lifestyle! More than a game, it is your self-expression!” Soccer’s inclusive nature also makes it a confidence booster for children of various ages and abilities. “With other sports, you have to be really fast or strong to be a part of it, but soccer is different,” he says. “You can be short or tall, fast or slow, experienced or inexperienced. It’s a year-round sport, so any kid can continue to develop the skills to be a great soccer player.”\n\nFor Gabor, seeing his players develop their character on and off the field is as important as winning. “It’s about improvement and building up great character traits in the long term, even if most of the players won’t play at the college level,” he says.\n\nThe best reward\n\nGabor views winning TeamSnap’s Coach of the Year award and receiving recognition from his players and their families as one of the many high points in his coaching career. “When you get great feedback you feel like you’re on a good path, and that the decisions you’ve made in your career were the right ones,” he says. “To see the children you work with improve every day is very rewarding.”\n\nSports, particularly soccer, offer a meaningful way for many immigrants to build community while staying connected to their heritage.

Gabor recalls a time when some parents pooled money for a few of his players who couldn’t afford a team trip to Europe. “These parents knew some of the players couldn’t afford the trip, but donated money because they knew the kids worked really hard for over two years,” he says. “The sacrifices these parents make for the team are amazing. Everyone is always looking out and helping each other.”\n\nGabor, who describes his coaching style as a “tough love” approach rooted in discipline and rigor, sets high expectations for his students. “To excel in a sport at a high level, you need to work a lot and change your lifestyle. I see my kids want to get better, and it’s great to see how these changes affect other areas of their lives,” he says. “They start to think about eating better, they’re going to sleep earlier, and they start to read more to learn about soccer or their other interests. They learn how to become better physically and mentally.”\n\nGabor embodies his approach in the Club’s motto: “More than a practice, it’s a lifestyle! More than a game, it is your self-expression!” Soccer’s inclusive nature also makes it a confidence booster for children of various ages and abilities. “With other sports, you have to be really fast or strong to be a part of it, but soccer is different,” he says. “You can be short or tall, fast or slow, experienced or inexperienced. It’s a year-round sport, so any kid can continue to develop the skills to be a great soccer player.”\n\nFor Gabor, seeing his players develop their character on and off the field is as important as winning. “It’s about improvement and building up great character traits in the long term, even if most of the players won’t play at the college level,” he says.\n\nThe best reward\n\nGabor views winning TeamSnap’s Coach of the Year award and receiving recognition from his players and their families as one of the many high points in his coaching career. “When you get great feedback you feel like you’re on a good path, and that the decisions you’ve made in your career were the right ones,” he says. “To see the children you work with improve every day is very rewarding.”",

(NASDAQ: RELY), a trusted provider of digital financial services that transcend borders, reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n“We are pleased with our second quarter performance as our product experience delights both new and existing customers,” said Matt Oppenheimer, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Remitly. “Our differentiated positioning, focus on building long-term customer trust, and our increasing global scale enabled these strong results. Looking ahead, we are pleased to raise our 2024 outlook for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.”\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Highlights and Key Operating Data\n\n(All comparisons relative to the second quarter of 2023)\n\nActive customers increased to 6.9 million, from 5.0 million, up 36%.\n\nSend volume increased to $13.2 billion, from $9.6 billion, up 38%.\n\nRevenue totaled $306.4 million, compared to $234.0 million, up 31%.\n\nNet loss was $12.1 million, compared to $18.9 million, an improvement of 36%.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $25.1 million, compared to $20.4 million, up 23%.\n\n2024 Financial Outlook\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, Remitly currently expects:\n\nTotal revenue in the range of $1,230 million to $1,250 million, representing a growth rate of 30% to 32% year over year. This outlook reflects an increase at the midpoint from our prior revenue outlook in the range of $1,225 million to $1,250 million.\n\nTo remain in a GAAP net loss position for 2024 and for Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. This outlook reflects an increase from our prior Adjusted EBITDA outlook in the range of $85 million and $95 million.\n\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this earnings release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” We have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of forecasted Adjusted EBITDA to forecasted GAAP net income (loss) or to forecasted GAAP income (loss) before income taxes within this earnings release because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, calculate certain reconciling items with confidence due to the variability, complexity, and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from forecasted Adjusted EBITDA. These items include, but are not limited to, income taxes and stock-based compensation expense, which are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. The variability of these items could have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\nNote: All percentage changes described within this press release are calculated using amounts in the Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), for which revenue and active customers are presented in thousands and send volume is presented in millions. Rounding differences may occur when individually calculating percentages or totals from rounded amounts included within the press release body as compared to the amounts included within the Company’s SEC filings.\n\nWebcast Information\n\nRemitly will host a webcast at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, July 31, 2024 to discuss its second quarter 2024 financial results. The live webcast and investor presentation will be accessible on Remitly’s website at https://ir.remitly.com. A webcast replay will be available on our website at https://ir.remitly.com following the live event.\n\nWe have used, and intend to continue to use, the Investor Relations section of our website at https://ir.remitly.com as a means of disclosing material nonpublic information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nSome of the financial information and data contained in this earnings release, such as Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expenses, have not been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\n\nWe regularly review our key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our performance, identify trends affecting our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information for management and investors in assessing our historical and future operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expenses are key output measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance, inform future operating plans, and make strategic long-term decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources. Remitly believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expenses provides additional tools to assess operational performance and trends in, and in comparing Remitly’s financial measures with, other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Remitly’s non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Because of the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures, you should consider the non-GAAP financial measures presented herein in conjunction with Remitly’s financial statements and the related notes thereto. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in this press release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted by (i) interest (income) expense, net, (ii) provision for income taxes, (iii) noncash charges of depreciation and amortization, (iv) gains and losses from the remeasurement of foreign currency assets and liabilities into their functional currency, (v) noncash charges associated with our donation of common stock in connection with our Pledge 1% commitment, (vi) noncash stock-based compensation expense, net, and (vii) certain acquisition, integration, restructuring, and other costs. We calculate non-GAAP operating expenses as our GAAP operating expenses adjusted by (i) noncash stock-based compensation expense, net, (ii) noncash charges associated with our donation of common stock in connection with our Pledge 1% commitment, as well as (iii) certain acquisition, integration, restructuring, and other costs.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

      "# [Remitly taps ads to woo new clients by Lynne Marek on 2024-01-10](https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/remitly-international-remittances-advertising-online/704148/)\nDive Brief:\n\nCross-border payments company Remitly boosted its advertising budget last year with a two-fold goal: to build its brand and attract new customers, CEO Matt Oppenheimer said in an interview.\n\nSeattle-based Remitly increased online ads, posted on social media sites such as Facebook and YouTube, to drive measurable customer acquisition, what it calls “performance marketing.” It also advertised in places like airports, to build brand awareness more broadly. Most of the ads are for performance marketing.\n\n“We’re doing very targeted brand marketing to, again, kind of water that tree to grow that fruit to make our performance marketing even more effective,” Oppenheimer said in an interview last week.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWith the increased marketing, Remitly has sought to expand its client set. That’s more the goal than increasing use of its services by existing customers, Oppenheimer said. For most of Remitly’s customers, the payments they’re sending, often to friends and family, are for non-discretionary needs like “basic living expenses, for emergency medical expenses, for college tuition,” he said.\n\nRemitly’s marketing expense, which includes advertising, rose 24% for the first nine months of last year, over 2022, to $159 million, as revenue jumped 47% for the nine-month period to nearly $680 million, according to the company’s most recently filed quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nonetheless, the company hasn’t been profitable, posting losses for the nine-month periods in both years, the filing said.\n\n“We understand performance-based marketing should have relatively short payback periods (measured by new users) while the benefits from brand marketing are typically realized over time,” analysts at the financial firm William Blair said in a Jan. 2 note to clients.\n\nAside from attracting customers, Remitly may draw potential acquirers too, according to the William Blair report. The financial firm included Remitly on a list of companies that may be attractive acquisitions because their stock prices have declined over the past year. A spokesperson for Remitly declined to comment on that possibility.\n\nOppenheimer sees plenty of room for growth, with the company having penetrated only 2% of the market, he estimates.\n\nRemitly in November extended a partnership with Visa after first partnering with the card network giant in 2019. In 2021, it also won investment backing from Visa and sold shares in an initial public offering that same year. Nonetheless, it has also retrenched in some areas too, pulling back on a digital bank account service called Passbook last year.\n\nRemitly aims to attract those remittance users who may have become dissatisfied, for whatever reason, with rival services, offered by competitors that include MoneyGram and Western Union. When consumers go online looking for alternatives, Oppenheimer expects his company’s ads may catch the consumer’s eye.\n\nThe bulk of remittance services are still handled offline, by small convenience stores in the U.S. as well as similar style bodegas in other countries. That’s because customers must have a high degree of trust in the outlets they’re working with, given the personal information provided and the transfer of money, Oppenheimer said.\n\nRecent global economic trouble doesn’t bother Oppenheimer because his remittance customers tend to be very “resilient,” with a need to send money to other places regardless of financial challenges, he said. “There’s a predictability and a priority and a resilience of our customers,” the CEO said.",

      "# [Remitly’s marketing spend: The impact of remittance advertising by Lucy Ingham on 2024-04-18](https://www.fxcintel.com/research/reports/ct-remitly-marketing-spend-money-transfers-advertising)\nRemitly’s leading marketing spend: The impact of money transfers advertising\n\nRemitly leads its consumer money transfers competitors when it comes to marketing spend. But how are its advertising campaigns having an impact?\n\nAttracting new customers – as well as retaining existing ones – is a critical part of any money transfers business, and vital to this is marketing. From social media to traditional advertising campaigns, marketing is a broad space that provides critical ongoing engagement with customers, reaching them not only on obvious full factors such as promotional pricing, but also on values, such as trust and impact.\n\nFor long-established players with strong brand recognition, marketing is a means of building on an often fairly strong existing brand perception, while for others it can mean a partial or even full introduction to a brand. However, not all companies in the money transfers space are spending similar amounts on marketing. Instead, our research shows that one company is significantly outspending its main competitors: Remitly.\n\nIn this report, we take a look at how Remitly is outspending other money transfers players, including Western Union, and consider how its most recent campaign is having an impact.\n\nTopics covered:"
