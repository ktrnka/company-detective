Occasionally, it goes by the hyphenated name “Guinea-Conakry” to differentiate it from other nearby countries.\n\nAlthough many of Guinea’s neighbors use the West African CFA franc, Guinea has had its own currency since 1959. Before sending money to friends or family in Guinea, let’s brush up on the history of the Guinea franc, including its banknotes and coinage.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Guinea currency, and how to look up the real-time exchange rate using a currency converter.\n\nGuinea currency basics\n\nThe Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea is responsible for issuing the Guinea franc, with seven banknote denominations commonly seen in circulation:\n\n100 francs\n\n500 francs\n\n1,000 francs\n\n2,000 francs\n\n5,000 francs\n\n10,000 francs\n\n20,000 francs\n\nThere are also 25 franc and 50 franc banknotes, but these are less common due to their low value. As for coins, you’ll find 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 franc denominations.\n\nThe design of the Guinea franc changes with every issue, and there have been several commemorative editions to mark occasions like the 50th anniversary of the Guinea franc.\n\nThey all feature the Guinean coat of arms, as well as culturally significant images such as a banana harvest, Mount Nimba, the Kaleta hydroelectric dam, or a bauxite mine.\n\nIf you’re looking to exchange the Guinea franc for a foreign currency, you can use the currency code GNF to look it up on foreign exchange markets.\n\nWithin the country, you may see the abbreviations FG‎, Fr, or GFr to denote Guinean money.\n\nHistory of Guinea’s currency\n\nThe country that’s now Guinea has a shared history with other West African countries, with the Ghana, Mali, and Songhai empires all exerting their influence on the region from as early as the 3rd century.\n\nGold played a major role from the start, both for decorative purposes and as currency in the form of gold dust, wire, and nuggets.\n\nPortuguese traders established ports in the 15th century, and France claimed the territory as part of the French Empire in the late 1800s. The French military called the colony Rivières du Sud, meaning “southern rivers,” before changing the name to French Guinea.\n\nFrance introduced the CFA franc in 1945 to provide a common currency throughout its West and Central African territories, including Guinea. You’ll find other versions of this currency in countries like Senegal and Cameroon.\n\nAfter gaining its independence in 1958, the Republic of Guinea developed its own legal tender, and the first Guinea franc arrived on the scene in 1959.\n\n7 surprising facts about Guinean currency\n\nDue to its geographical location and natural resources, the Republic of Guinea has had a major role in the economy of the region—and an effect on other currencies of the world.\n\nHere are seven surprising facts about Guinea’s currency that you may not know:\n\n1. ‘Guinea’ is also the name of an old English coin.\n\nIf you hear someone mention a “Guinea coin” in a historical context, chances are they aren’t talking about the Guinea franc. The guinea is the name of a gold coin that was first minted in 1663 and used throughout the British Empire until 1814.\n\nSo, why was it called the guinea? They made the coin with gold from the Guinea region, and then it became the name of the coin itself.\n\nAt one point, a guinea was worth 21 shillings or 1.05 pounds. The guinea is no longer legal tender in the United Kingdom, but it was valid until Decimal Day in 1971, when decimalisation changed the way money was represented in the U.K. system.\n\n2. The Republic of Guinea previously used the CFA franc.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1958, Guinea used the French colonial currency, the CFA franc. After the end of the colonial period, the CFA franc evolved into two different currencies: the West African CFA franc and the Central African CFA franc.\n\nThese two currencies have the same value and are interchangeable in all 14 countries that use them. Since they’re pegged to the euro (EUR), they don’t float freely on global currency markets and have a fixed value of €1 to 655.957 CFA francs.\n\nThe Republic of Guinea, however, never joined the currency union that uses the CFA franc. It issues its own currency with its own free-floating exchange rate.\n\n3. There are no centimes in circulation.\n\nLike the CFA francs, one Guinea franc consists of 100 centimes—but you won’t find centimes anywhere in Guinea.\n\nThat’s because the value of the centime is so low that the Central Bank has never issued any denomination smaller than 1 GNF.\n\n4. Guinea briefly switched to the syli in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1971, the country introduced the syli, a currency made up of 100 cauris. Although the Central Bank issued syli coins and banknotes, at 10 francs to 1 syli, they didn’t last long: In 1985, Guinea switched back to the franc, with 1 franc equal to 1 syli.\n\n5. Guinea banknotes use the French language.\n\nIf you look at a Guinea banknote, you’ll notice that most of the writing is in French. For example, 20,000 francs is written as “vingt mille francs guinéens.”\n\nThis is because Guinea was a French territory until 1958. In fact, the official language of the Republic of Guinea is still French.\n\n6. A British printing house designed the early Guinean franc.\n\nDespite getting its name from French currency, several early print runs of the Guinean franc happened in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe iconic De La Rue printing house, which is the largest company of its kind in the world, designed an early set of banknotes.\n\nDe La Rue has worked with at least 140 countries and has designed over one-third of the world’s currency denominations.\n\n7. Guinean banknotes have numerous security features.\n\nIn addition to their beautiful designs, Guinean banknotes contain holographic patches, security strips, and other advanced features to prevent fraud.\n\nOver the years, these have included various watermarks, diamond-shaped patches, and the letters “RG” (Republic of Guinea) to denote their authenticity.\n\nUnderstanding Guinea franc exchange rates\n\nThe Guinea franc is a free-floating currency, which means its value fluctuates compared to other global currencies, such as the U.S. dollar (USD) or the Canadian dollar (CAD).\n\nIn recent years, Guinea’s economy has experienced high inflation—12.60% in 2021—but the country remains a major exporter of gold, bauxite, and other natural resources.\n\nIf you intend to travel to Guinea, you’ll likely want to take cash with you in your local currency and convert it to Guinea francs when you arrive, since ATMs have small withdrawal limits and credit card transactions are rare.\n\nYou can also use a money transfer service to send money to Guinea, with options for receiving funds via a bank deposit, mobile money, or cash pickup.\n\nSend money to Guinea from overseas\n\nWhen you need to send funds to loved ones in Guinea, Remitly makes it easy with a secure mobile app and transparent transaction fees.\n\nYou can send your transfer with a debit card or credit card and track it every step of the way.\n\nDownload the app, and we’ll show you how to get started today.\n\nFurther reading",

User Beware and don’t repeat my mistake.\n\nHere comes the rant: I send money to my family pretty often, so when I heard of an app that lets me do a direct deposit, I was extremely happy. I use a VPN on my home network so I didn’t even think twice about it becoming a major problem. I sent a small amount for validation purposes and when it was received (!!!) - I proceeded to sending the rest. This is when the fun began. First, I was selected for a “verification” process. Fine, I get it - foreign country, second transaction in the same day - the realities of the world we live in. \n\nI had to call them - honestly I don’t understand why in the current world any of what I had to answer and upload couldn’t have been done interactively via the app, but whatever, it is what it is. \n\nAfter an hour of answering questions and being assured that everything is clear and my recipient will be getting the transfer shortly, I hung up and went back to the app to review the current status. \n\nBLOCKED. \nThey BLOCKER me, after telling me that everything is RESOLVED.\n\nI call again. Another hour of my day wasted, trying to explain to multiple people in a chain as to what happened to finally find out that using a VPN is a problem (again - perfectly fine with that but why did it work the first time? And why did the other rep tell me I’m all set if it was clearly a lie?). Long story short, I’m told that my money will be eventually refunded and a team member will call tomorrow to unlock my account.\n\n…It’s been a month, they are still getting to it I guess. Money did come back a week or so ago after the max pending time was exceeded so I guess I’m grateful for that.\nNeedless to say that even if at some point the company remembers about my existence and calls, I’m not using the service again.",

I have several friends who live abroad & I would send them money. \n\nAfter finally getting a manager on the phone to explain, he basically danced around the question. But he did say they reserve the right to cancel an account at any time. So I asked pointed questions to find out what the reason may have been. After several minutes of avoiding the questions he finally said it may have been because someone was trying to scam the account. \n\nNow if this is the case, I’m a victim. I certainly wouldn’t try to scam my own account, but to then say well because of this we’re permanently suspending the account. So, I’m a victim of a scam? Why can’t I get the chance to set up another account? Is this fair? He did not respond, & in fact at this point apparently put the phone down and was not even listening to me. He was done with me. \n\nBeware. There is no consumer protection for this type of company. They do whatever they want & treat you like you don’t matter. It’s ok as long as everything is going smooth. But they are terrible with customer service. There are other companies out there, so do your research. I would not recommend them as a company to do business with. Keep searching.

      "# Scar, 1 stars [(wilshi, Apple App Store, 2024-09-24)](https://apple/11760345943)\nI registered to use this App before embarking for a trip of a lifetime. I was traveling with 4 other people and we were all to use the APP for our own individual purchases! When I attempted to process the payments for services it was then that I was informed that my payments would not be processed because Remitly needed me to upload my bank statement which was NEVER requested when I. Rested the account!\n\nI found myself in a very scary and precarious situation with threats made because of this. Despite the many phone calls to and from the company, I was getting absolutely nowhere! I repeatedly told one of the agents that the bank had contacted via text to prove that I was the one making the transactions and I would be willing to send her the proof and she would not accept. \n\nI do NOT appreciate my life being put in danger when the company failed to do their job!  Furthermore I questioned why I was the only who needed to upload my bank statement to which i never got a response ! \n\nRemilty needs to DO BETTER!  This is unacceptable",

      "# Wild ride of an awful customer service, 1 stars [(olya9946, Apple App Store, 2024-09-20)](https://apple/11745265433)\nI’ll preface this with the following - I should have diligently looked at their terms and conditions to see that they are allergic to VPN. User Beware and don’t repeat my mistake.\n\nHere comes the rant: I send money to my family pretty often, so when I heard of an app that lets me do a direct deposit, I was extremely happy. I use a VPN on my home network so I didn’t even think twice about it becoming a major problem. I sent a small amount for validation purposes and when it was received (!!!) - I proceeded to sending the rest. This is when the fun began. First, I was selected for a “verification” process. Fine, I get it - foreign country, second transaction in the same day - the realities of the world we live in. \n\nI had to call them - honestly I don’t understand why in the current world any of what I had to answer and upload couldn’t have been done interactively via the app, but whatever, it is what it is. \n\nAfter an hour of answering questions and being assured that everything is clear and my recipient will be getting the transfer shortly, I hung up and went back to the app to review the current status. \n\nBLOCKED. \nThey BLOCKER me, after telling me that everything is RESOLVED.\n\nI call again. Another hour of my day wasted, trying to explain to multiple people in a chain as to what happened to finally find out that using a VPN is a problem (again - perfectly fine with that but why did it work the first time? And why did the other rep tell me I’m all set if it was clearly a lie?). Long story short, I’m told that my money will be eventually refunded and a team member will call tomorrow to unlock my account.\n\n…It’s been a month, they are still getting to it I guess. Money did come back a week or so ago after the max pending time was exceeded so I guess I’m grateful for that.\nNeedless to say that even if at some point the company remembers about my existence and calls, I’m not using the service again.",

      "# They will arbitrarily suspend you without warning, 3 stars [(Coop7832, Apple App Store, 2024-08-31)](https://apple/11674626482)\nAt first I thought this was a great app. However, you need to be aware that they will arbitrarily suspend your account, & will offer little to no explanation. \n\nAfter following up to see what was the reason for the suspension, they offered very little information, or an explanation. I have several friends who live abroad & I would send them money. \n\nAfter finally getting a manager on the phone to explain, he basically danced around the question. But he did say they reserve the right to cancel an account at any time. So I asked pointed questions to find out what the reason may have been. After several minutes of avoiding the questions he finally said it may have been because someone was trying to scam the account. \n\nNow if this is the case, I’m a victim. I certainly wouldn’t try to scam my own account, but to then say well because of this we’re permanently suspending the account. So, I’m a victim of a scam? Why can’t I get the chance to set up another account? Is this fair? He did not respond, & in fact at this point apparently put the phone down and was not even listening to me. He was done with me. \n\nBeware. There is no consumer protection for this type of company. They do whatever they want & treat you like you don’t matter. It’s ok as long as everything is going smooth. But they are terrible with customer service. There are other companies out there, so do your research. I would not recommend them as a company to do business with. Keep searching. They are not customer-oriented AT ALL. You deserve to be treated with respect and fairness - or take your business elsewhere!!",

What can I do? with +11 score by [(notdoreen, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Banking/comments/193cs4k/remitly_just_took_my_3000_dollars_what_can_i_do/)\nEDIT2: After my complaint to the BBB and they reached out and offered a full refund. I also asked that they refund the late fees incurred because of them and they did(in the form of a credit). I immediately used the credit and vowed not to use their service again.\n\n\n\nEDIT: I submitted complaints via the BBB and CFBP shortly after my original post.\n\nToday 1/12/2023 the status of the transaction magically changed from \"completed\" to on hold.\n\nI called and Remitly couldn't tell me why the transaction was on hold or why they had initially marked it as completed to begin with.\n\nAfter reconfirming that all the information was correct their resolution was to change the \"banking partner\" on the transaction to a different banking partner. I asked who the previous one was and who the new one would be and the rep said he couldn't share that info. Mind you I have been asking about these \"banking partners\" since the beginning because something about the whole thing seems fishy but Remitly won't share who these partners are and what they do exactly.\n\nAnyways instead of doing that I asked to cancel the transaction so I can get a refund. As soon as the money is back in my account I'm resending using my bank's wire transfer and I'm closing the Remitly account for good. I don't need these headaches in my life.\n\nTLDR; I sent a transaction of more than $3,000. Remitly didn't deliver the money but are claiming that they did. Every time I call they tell me they'll escalate the case and conduct an investigation. It's been 2 weeks and they keep telling me the same thing.\n\n\n\nOn 12/28/2023 1 initiated a transfer of $3154.57 from my US account to my international\n\naccount.\n\nOn 1/03/2024 I received a notification that the transfer had been completed. As of 1/10/2024, the money has not been delivered to the account.\n\nI have called Remitly on 8 different occations and have been told different stories about what's going on, including:\n\n* The transaction is complete and I'm incorrect\n* My bank is closed(lt's not)\n* Remitly is conducting an investigation and I'll hear back in 24 hours(l haven't)\n\nI have provived Remitly with copies of my official bank statement that clearly show the money was never received. Depending on who picks up the phone or chat, the Remitly rep states either of the following:\n\n* They spoke with my bank and my bank told them the money was deposited into my\n\naccount\n\n* They are doing an investigation(again)\n\nI have checked with my bank multiple times and they have told m e they have not been contacted by Remitly, and they have no received any funds from them so Remitly is clearly lying and refusing to provide any useful information. I have asked Remitly repeatedly to provide me with the emails they claim to have received from my bank stating the funds were deposited but they can't/won't. I have also asked to speak with the \"internal department\" conducting the investigation but have been told that I can't speak with them and that they will contact me once the investigation is completed.\n\nLast week I was told the investigation would be completed and I would get a resolution today 1/10/2024. When I called today I was told all of the above again and now they are\n\nsupposedly conducting a new investigation...\n\nI just filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau but other than that I don't know what I can do here.

Basically, if your full name and/or other information doesn't closely match, that could be part of the issue. Not saying it is, but very commonly people move and don't promptly update their state id / driver's license, etc. One is supposed to even if they just move down the street. While states generally don't enforce such stuff, it causes problems with automated verification many services use.\n\nIf your full name matches up and not moved at all, then something else triggered the review. Even how you accessed the website, such as through a VPN. Don't know if they have an app, but if using that, maybe had location turned off, which many sites utilize for additional fraud screening.\n\nBBB is a good start. See how that goes, but don't wait too long. If by end of week no progress, file a complaint with CFPB.\n\n## Comment ID khebnja with +1 score by [(Old_Gap_6174, Reddit, 2024-01-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Banking/comments/193cs4k/remitly_just_took_my_3000_dollars_what_can_i_do/khebnja/) (in reply to ID 193cs4k):\nHi u/notdoreen, I'm sorry to hear about the issues you're facing with Remitly.

So security doesn't seem to be their strength.\n\nI also set up a Wise account.  When I wanted to do a transfer, they verify my email, they send 2FA verification codes with every sign-in.  They require more frequent sign-in and more frequent verification codes.  They require a picture of my identification and a selfie of myself.

Would sending €100 via the Remitly app to an online bank account that accepts other currencies, such as Revolut work, do you think? I have just rebooted my Revolut account today, having not used it since 2019 having pocketed the sign up bonus. \n\nAny advice, tips, workarounds to meet the terms of this offer (and any similar ones because there are a lot of international money transfer ones about) will be gratefully received.

Boss used to allow GCash but they’ve stopped.  \n\nAt one point I used coins.ph to send crypto, but I lost access to my account when I left PH and could no longer satisfy their residency requirements.

My Security Bank account got closed while I was in the US during Covid though. \n\nMy experience is that many times people will let others “borrow” their Gcash accounts, and those get flagged by Globe/Gcash.

Rule#1 - always have a backup source.  Make sure you have other ways to send funds.\n\nWhat I heard (it could be anecdotal), is that most of the time this happens is when you're sending money to an account in your own name.  A few people that I heard this happen to in the past said they were sending to themselves.\n\nAnother trigger could be that it checks your location anytime you open it and if your source account is in your home country and you're sending to an account in the Philippines, with you also being present there, it could be a factor.\n\nObviously, it's speculative, they won't say, so we don't know.

          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "Product/business \r\nCore product is not up to par with competitors. PMs get the blame for this, but 1) leadership is unclear on its priorities 2) Many Engineering teams have been understaffed (1-3 engineers for core parts of the product) for years. Choice to move many Engineering teams to cheaper markets (Poland, elsewhere) has strained communication between Engineering &amp; US-based PMs and the organization has been slow to do anything to respond to complaints about the risk &amp; inefficiency this creates. New initiatives have all fizzled so far (though maybe it’s good that the business is willing to recognize a sunk cost fallacy, at some point). \r\n\r\nData \r\nUnclear what the relationship between Data Engineering/ML Analytics is supposed to be. The leadership of the former does their own thing and only brings in Analytics when their plans are 90% done. No VP+ role in data, no career progression for Data Scientists, roles not aligned to industry standards. Just not a mature organization from a data standpoint. \r\n\r\nCustomer Centricity \r\nIt seems like the business is getting further away from customers, not closer. Passbook (closed neobank initiative) was targeted at Mexican immigrants to the US, but run by an all-white team. North America markets drive the business, but over the past year, now very few people in the Business team have ever lived in North America (no one in leadership; run from London). Understanding of customer needs, lives is super uneven across teams.\r\n\r\n Leadership \r\nAlmost everyone is in their first-ever C-level role. “Stay paranoid” attitude is not playing out in a healthy way. Infighting, scapegoating, excusing bad behavior &amp; mismanagement for favorite directors/VPs is spilling over and corrupting the great culture the company was known for in recent years. \r\n\r\nHR\r\n Chaotic. Rife with personal conflicts, toxic personalities allowed to flourish. Turnover is incredibly high in the recruiting, HR Business Partner, and HR ops groups. HR representatives seem to be lacking in some core training around employee conflict resolution, DEI, even labor laws (some HR reps supervise staff in multiple countries). Tendency is for HR reps to make immediate problems go away for Management at the expense of protecting the company. If you’re Level 4 or below, asking HR for help will probably only make things worse.\r\n\r\n DEI \r\n“Diverse” candidates be warned. The fact that most of the DEI team left this year tells you what you need to know. Smooth-talking men from well-represented backgrounds &amp; elite schools are strongly encouraged to apply. The company has plenty of data on how bad attrition for women, POC, and people who have taken FMLA is at &amp; above Level 3, they just won’t talk about it. Is it worse than other corporations? TBD, but it’s certainly not better. The progress the former DEI team was making stalled out around IPO time. Being in an employee resource group, particularly in leadership, can feel like wearing a “Troublemaker” label. \r\n\r\nGender: Most engineering teams are all men; where there’s a woman on the team, she’s definitely the one being asked to do all of the team lunch reservations. Women can enjoy the comments about how great their smile is, how emotional they are, but how they’re not very strategic in their performance reviews. It's definitely not like this in every team, but these things happen way more often than they should, and employees have no recourse when they do.  Men can get satisfactory performance reviews for shipping nothing, so long as their boss likes them. Underperforming men leave when they get new external jobs. High-performing women get assigned additional tasks like mentoring, recruiting, cultural centricity promotion, &amp; emotional labor-type work that the company will never reward, and then be told they did not drive enough business value at their next review. The departure rate for women at L3 and above (across functions) has visibly accelerated since Q4 2022. Multiple well-respected women who have complained about gender bias issues in the past year have mysteriously had their roles eliminated. \r\n\r\nRace: Management has expressed skepticism that ‘diverse’ teams can actually “perform” to managers that make an effort to make the company more representative of the customer base (immigrants). Only a few VP+ leaders are past the ‘I don’t see race and gender’ and ‘I have a black friend/I have a daughter’ level on their DEI learning. \r\n\r\nFMLA &amp; Disability, new parents: As another review said, if you need disability accommodations, good luck. Nursing mothers pressured to do non-essential travel, managers told that covid illnesses are not an acceptable reason to push back non-business-critical work. New mothers have had it made clear to them that having a baby and taking leave is the reason they weren’t promoted.",

        "cons": "Product/business \r\nCore product is not up to par with competitors. PMs get the blame for this, but 1) leadership is unclear on its priorities 2) Many Engineering teams have been understaffed (1-3 engineers for core parts of the product) for years. Choice to move many Engineering teams to cheaper markets (Poland, elsewhere) has strained communication between Engineering &amp; US-based PMs and the organization has been slow to do anything to respond to complaints about the risk &amp; inefficiency this creates. New initiatives have all fizzled so far (though maybe it’s good that the business is willing to recognize a sunk cost fallacy, at some point). \r\n\r\nData \r\nUnclear what the relationship between Data Engineering/ML Analytics is supposed to be. The leadership of the former does their own thing and only brings in Analytics when their plans are 90% done. No VP+ role in data, no career progression for Data Scientists, roles not aligned to industry standards. Just not a mature organization from a data standpoint. \r\n\r\nCustomer Centricity \r\nIt seems like the business is getting further away from customers, not closer. Passbook (closed neobank initiative) was targeted at Mexican immigrants to the US, but run by an all-white team. North America markets drive the business, but over the past year, now very few people in the Business team have ever lived in North America (no one in leadership; run from London). Understanding of customer needs, lives is super uneven across teams.\r\n\r\n Leadership \r\nAlmost everyone is in their first-ever C-level role. “Stay paranoid” attitude is not playing out in a healthy way. Infighting, scapegoating, excusing bad behavior &amp; mismanagement for favorite directors/VPs is spilling over and corrupting the great culture the company was known for in recent years. \r\n\r\nHR\r\n Chaotic. Rife with personal conflicts, toxic personalities allowed to flourish. Turnover is incredibly high in the recruiting, HR Business Partner, and HR ops groups. HR representatives seem to be lacking in some core training around employee conflict resolution, DEI, even labor laws (some HR reps supervise staff in multiple countries). Tendency is for HR reps to make immediate problems go away for Management at the expense of protecting the company. If you’re Level 4 or below, asking HR for help will probably only make things worse.\r\n\r\n DEI \r\n“Diverse” candidates be warned. The fact that most of the DEI team left this year tells you what you need to know. Smooth-talking men from well-represented backgrounds &amp; elite schools are strongly encouraged to apply. The company has plenty of data on how bad attrition for women, POC, and people who have taken FMLA is at &amp; above Level 3, they just won’t talk about it. Is it worse than other corporations? TBD, but it’s certainly not better. The progress the former DEI team was making stalled out around IPO time. Being in an employee resource group, particularly in leadership, can feel like wearing a “Troublemaker” label. \r\n\r\nGender: Most engineering teams are all men; where there’s a woman on the team, she’s definitely the one being asked to do all of the team lunch reservations. Women can enjoy the comments about how great their smile is, how emotional they are, but how they’re not very strategic in their performance reviews. It's definitely not like this in every team, but these things happen way more often than they should, and employees have no recourse when they do.  Men can get satisfactory performance reviews for shipping nothing, so long as their boss likes them. Underperforming men leave when they get new external jobs. High-performing women get assigned additional tasks like mentoring, recruiting, cultural centricity promotion, &amp; emotional labor-type work that the company will never reward, and then be told they did not drive enough business value at their next review. The departure rate for women at L3 and above (across functions) has visibly accelerated since Q4 2022. Multiple well-respected women who have complained about gender bias issues in the past year have mysteriously had their roles eliminated. \r\n\r\nRace: Management has expressed skepticism that ‘diverse’ teams can actually “perform” to managers that make an effort to make the company more representative of the customer base (immigrants). Only a few VP+ leaders are past the ‘I don’t see race and gender’ and ‘I have a black friend/I have a daughter’ level on their DEI learning. \r\n\r\nFMLA &amp; Disability, new parents: As another review said, if you need disability accommodations, good luck. Nursing mothers pressured to do non-essential travel, managers told that covid illnesses are not an acceptable reason to push back non-business-critical work. New mothers have had it made clear to them that having a baby and taking leave is the reason they weren’t promoted.",

A lot of people really do want to do right by their colleagues, but more and more, incentives don't encourage that. Marketing team is very distributed (remote) and more diverse than the rest of the company. There are still a couple of leaders who are well-loved by their teams.",

      "# [Remitly taps ads to woo new clients by Lynne Marek on 2024-01-10](https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/remitly-international-remittances-advertising-online/704148/)\nDive Brief:\n\nCross-border payments company Remitly boosted its advertising budget last year with a two-fold goal: to build its brand and attract new customers, CEO Matt Oppenheimer said in an interview.\n\nSeattle-based Remitly increased online ads, posted on social media sites such as Facebook and YouTube, to drive measurable customer acquisition, what it calls “performance marketing.” It also advertised in places like airports, to build brand awareness more broadly. Most of the ads are for performance marketing.\n\n“We’re doing very targeted brand marketing to, again, kind of water that tree to grow that fruit to make our performance marketing even more effective,” Oppenheimer said in an interview last week.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWith the increased marketing, Remitly has sought to expand its client set. That’s more the goal than increasing use of its services by existing customers, Oppenheimer said. For most of Remitly’s customers, the payments they’re sending, often to friends and family, are for non-discretionary needs like “basic living expenses, for emergency medical expenses, for college tuition,” he said.\n\nRemitly’s marketing expense, which includes advertising, rose 24% for the first nine months of last year, over 2022, to $159 million, as revenue jumped 47% for the nine-month period to nearly $680 million, according to the company’s most recently filed quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nonetheless, the company hasn’t been profitable, posting losses for the nine-month periods in both years, the filing said.\n\n“We understand performance-based marketing should have relatively short payback periods (measured by new users) while the benefits from brand marketing are typically realized over time,” analysts at the financial firm William Blair said in a Jan. 2 note to clients.\n\nAside from attracting customers, Remitly may draw potential acquirers too, according to the William Blair report. The financial firm included Remitly on a list of companies that may be attractive acquisitions because their stock prices have declined over the past year. A spokesperson for Remitly declined to comment on that possibility.\n\nOppenheimer sees plenty of room for growth, with the company having penetrated only 2% of the market, he estimates.\n\nRemitly in November extended a partnership with Visa after first partnering with the card network giant in 2019. In 2021, it also won investment backing from Visa and sold shares in an initial public offering that same year. Nonetheless, it has also retrenched in some areas too, pulling back on a digital bank account service called Passbook last year.\n\nRemitly aims to attract those remittance users who may have become dissatisfied, for whatever reason, with rival services, offered by competitors that include MoneyGram and Western Union. When consumers go online looking for alternatives, Oppenheimer expects his company’s ads may catch the consumer’s eye.\n\nThe bulk of remittance services are still handled offline, by small convenience stores in the U.S. as well as similar style bodegas in other countries. That’s because customers must have a high degree of trust in the outlets they’re working with, given the personal information provided and the transfer of money, Oppenheimer said.\n\nRecent global economic trouble doesn’t bother Oppenheimer because his remittance customers tend to be very “resilient,” with a need to send money to other places regardless of financial challenges, he said. “There’s a predictability and a priority and a resilience of our customers,” the CEO said.",

(NASDAQ: RELY) (“Remitly”), a leading digital financial services provider for immigrants and their families, today announced they’ve joined forces to expand access to cross-border payments and remittances. Tapping into the power of the Mastercard network, Remitly will integrate Mastercard’s Send and Cross-Border Services to offer its customers more choice in how they securely send money to family and loved ones abroad via the Remitly app.\n\nConvenient and secure access to remittances serves as a lifeline for many. According to Mastercard’s upcoming 2023 Borderless Payments Report, 41 percent of consumers who have made cross-border payments in the last 12 months intend to increase the frequency of their cross-border transactions over the next year to provide critical financial support for family and friends overseas. Further, in a November 2022 survey of approximately 2,000 remittance senders conducted by Remitly, 34 percent of respondents said that money sent home is the primary source of income for their recipient’s household. Remitly and Mastercard are committed to improving the transparency, convenience, and speed of delivering these critical funds to Remitly’s customers’ families and loved ones.\n\n\"Remitly is committed to transforming the way money moves internationally so that our customers can send money with complete confidence and peace of mind,\" said Matt Oppenheimer, Co-founder & CEO of Remitly. \"Our partnership with Mastercard demonstrates continued progress toward this monumental goal, adding breadth and depth to our robust payments network, so more customers around the world can access the trusted cross border payments they need to support their loved ones back home.\"\n\nTogether, Mastercard and Remitly are making it more convenient to send money abroad. Backed by the speed, reach, and trust of the Mastercard network, Mastercard Send enables U.S.-based Remitly customers to fund transactions via their debit card. Remitly has also integrated Mastercard Cross-Border Services to offer customers more choice in how recipients can access their funds through a variety of disbursement options within Mastercard’s global network, such as bank accounts, cash pick-up locations, and mobile wallets.\n\n“Having grown up in Mexico, I know first-hand how vital it is to quickly and securely send and access funds abroad to support critical everyday expenses,” said Silvana Hernandez, Executive Vice President, Product and Engineering, North America, Mastercard. “Our collaboration provides Remitly users with an added layer of convenience and peace of mind, ensuring that funds get into the right hands when they need it most.”\n\nTogether, Mastercard and Remitly are providing convenience and optionality for each step in the remittance journey.",

That means that it's likely to get punished if it comes up short on the top line, and that's exactly what happened today.\n\nRevenue in the quarter rose 32% to $269.1 million, but that was a bit shy of the consensus of $274 million. Active customers rose 36% to 6.2 million, and send volume jumped 34% to $11.5 billion.\n\nThe company also made progress on the cost side as it controlled spending on a number of line items, including transaction expenses, customer support, and general and administrative expenses. On the bottom line, it showed improvement, as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose from $5.4 million to $19.3 million. On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, its loss per share narrowed from $0.16 to $0.11, beating estimates at a loss of $0.14 per share.\n\nCEO Matt Oppenheimer said, \"We are pleased with our strong start to the year that reflects our resilient customer base and superior customer experience.\"\n\nWhat's next for Remitly?\n\nThe sell-off in Remitly shares was a bit surprising considering that the company also raised its EBITDA guidance for the year.\n\nRemitly, which competes with money-transfer specialists like Western Union and Moneygram, maintained its full-year revenue forecast of $1.225 billion-$1.25 billion, representing 30%-32% growth, but raised its EBITDA forecast from $75 million-$90 million to $85 million-$95 million.\n\nNonetheless, investors still seem concerned about the first-quarter miss, although it seems unlikely to impact full-year results.\n\nRemitly continues to look like a promising growth stock, but investors should continue to expect volatility here.",

Bobby joins us from Charles Schwab, where he was the Managing Director and Head of Diversity and Inclusion. His DEI initiatives were instrumental in securing Schwab’s position as one of Forbes’ Best Places to Work for Diversity in 2023, as well as one of the Best Places to Work by Disability Inc. for two consecutive years. Throughout his career, Bobby has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to DEI principles, beginning with his role as a diversity recruiter and liaison for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) at State Farm. Bobby’s extensive background at Fortune 500 companies, including USAA and TIAA/Nuveen, is marked by his involvement in “Be The Change,” an internal D&I initiative by TIAA/Nuveen that evolved into a brand campaign. His comprehensive expertise spans human resources, operations, and marketing, enriching his approach to DEI with a broad business perspective. He is based in Remitly’s Seattle headquarters.\n\nBobby’s decision to join Remitly is fueled by the company’s commitment to serving immigrants and their families. His passion for Remitly, along with his broad global insight and depth of experience within financial services, made Bobby the ideal candidate. “It’s critical to have someone in this role whose values are aligned and are mission-driven,” Rene Yoakum, Remitly’s EVP of Customer and Culture, says. “Bobby has a great financial services background from companies that we all deeply respect, and he really understands the space and our business.”\n\nFor Rene, Bobby’s expertise and track record in advancing DEI initiatives within the U.S. and on a global scale aligns with Remitly’s mission and strategic objectives. With a workforce of more than 2,700 employees, “we have an opportunity to create a global dream team in the way that we think about diversity,” says Rene. “We want to bring people with all varieties of lived experiences, perspectives, strengths, and expertise because we know that diversity of thought will create better products for our customers.”\n\nBobby highlights the role of a diverse team in driving Remitly’s customer and business impact, emphasizing the importance of feeling valued, having one’s opinions heard, and seizing opportunities for growth and contribution within the organization. “As a global workforce, we all want to feel a sense that we matter, our opinions are going to be fairly heard, and a chance to develop and contribute to the success of Remitly across the globe,” he says.\n\nBobby is excited to expand Remitly’s diversity and inclusion program at a time of continued exciting global growth for the company. As he steps into this new role, Bobby sees an opportunity to grow this program alongside the business. “What I hope to accomplish at Remitly is to be part of the growth strategy and propel the company to the 15 and 20-year mark and beyond,” he says. “We want to build that sense of inclusion and belonging for everyone who works at Remitly.”\n\nTo explore career opportunities at Remitly, please visit our Careers page.\n\nThis week, Remitly welcomed a new VP of Global DEI, Bobby Wilkinson.

      "# [Visa and Remitly Expand Collaboration to Digitally Streamline Global Remittance Market by PYMNTS, www.facebook.com on 2023-11-20](https://www.pymnts.com/news/cross-border-commerce/cross-border-payments/2023/visa-and-remitly-expand-collaboration-to-digitally-streamline-global-remittance-market/)\nYanilsa Gonzalez-Ore, North America Head of Visa Direct and Global Ecosystem Readiness, and Remitly’s CEO Matt Oppenheimer told PYMNTS cross-border money transfers are ripe for app-driven, digital modernization.\n\n“Global money movement has not yet evolved to the levels expected and needed by the world,” said Gonzalez-Ore, who added that speed, cost and transparency continue to be cross-border pain points. Real-time and digital-first solutions are among the best ways to address those pain points and alleviate frictions, she said.\n\nMonday (Nov 20), Remitly and Visa said they had expanded their collaboration, first detailed in May 2021, that seeks to streamline cross-border fund flows.\n\nOppenheimer and Gonzalez-Ore noted that the expanded efforts enable Remitly customers in more than 15 countries, including the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Australia, to push funds directly to holders’ Visa debit cards and bank accounts in more than 100 jurisdictions globally. The transfers can be tracked directly through the Remitly app.\n\nTaking Note of the Digital Shift\n\nOppenheimer said that the expansion takes into account the “structural shift” that’s been gaining momentum since the Visa/Remitly collaboration was announced initially, where, traditionally, most remittance activity began and ended at a physical location (such as at remittance agents). The pandemic, of course, moved more individuals to embrace digital options to move funds, using their devices as digitally-enabled endpoints to facilitate push-to-card transactions.\n\nIn terms of the mechanics of the transactions themselves, senders enter a recipient’s name and 16-digit Visa debit card number into the Remitly app in order to send funds to Visa debit cards and to recipients’ bank accounts. At a high level, said Oppenheimer, the move helps bolster Remitly’s bid to expand its network “for customers to send money to 4 billion bank accounts, 1.2 billion mobile wallets and more than 460,000 cash pickup locations.”\n\nFor Visa, said Gonzalez-Ore, the expansion broadens financial inclusion for millions of migrant workers sending money to loved ones globally.\n\nAsked by PYMNTS for an illustrative use case, Oppenheimer offered that 80% of remittance transfers support households’ needs and medical expenses. Funds sent to pay for an individual’s emergency surgery, he said, “are critical. They’re a lifeline,” and speed, reliability and transparency are critical, too.\n\n“Someone who’s sending money home for their child,” he told PYMNTS, “cannot afford for that transaction to be delayed.” Partnering with Visa, he added, enables the funds to be collected and disbursed securely.\n\nEarly Innings, Still\n\nIt’s still early innings in the digital shift that is helping transform remittances, said Oppenheimer, who added that Remitly has only about 2%+ share of the $1.6 trillion in remittances that cross borders each year. The opportunity is there, noted Oppenheimer, to expand beyond remittances and craft financial services ecosystems for immigrants and their families.\n\nAdded Gonzalez-Ore, P2P payments serve as “tip of the spear for a change in money movement.” Consumers have gotten used to the convenience and speed that they’ve enjoyed as part of everyday domestic transactions. They’ll expect the same in cross-border interactions — and remittances, after all, are a form of international P2P payments. We’re headed toward a future where cross-border payroll and other use cases build on the interactions forged through the collaborations between Visa and Remitly.\n\nAs Gonzalez-Ore told PYMNTS, “this is an example of how different players in the ecosystem can come together to change the way things operate today and help evolve money movement…it’s an alignment of goals and we are excited for it to continue for the longer term.”",
