      "# [Budgeting Basics for Small Business Owners by Cassidy Rush on 2025-03-27](https://blog.remitly.com/business/budgeting/)\nA business budget is a guide to help you handle your money and reach your goals.\n\nIt includes predicting income, keeping an eye on costs, and making smart choices on how to use resources.\n\nImportant parts of a budget are estimating income, examining fixed and variable costs, and planning for profit.\n\nBy making and following a budget, you can have better control over your cash flow, make smart choices, and boost your chances of success.\n\nRunning a small business in the United States, particularly in a busy metro area, demands strong financial skills. A key part that many forget is budgeting. Making and keeping detailed budget reports is essential for any business owner who wants to grow and make a profit over time.\n\nUnderstanding the Importance of Budgeting in Business\n\nRunning a business without a budget is like trying to find your way in a new city without a map. A budget acts as your financial guide. It shows you your income, expenses, and resources. A budget helps you keep track of your money, spot issues early, and make smart choices for your business later on.\n\nThe Role of Budgeting in Financial Management\n\nBudgeting is a key part of managing money well. At its heart, a budget takes your financial goals and turns them into a clear plan. This plan, usually as an approved budget, outlines the money you expect to make and the costs you expect to have. It also acts as a standard to measure how well you are doing financially. By looking at what you actually earn and spend compared to the budget proposals, you can easily see differences. You can then find out why these differences happen and take steps to stay focused on your goals.\n\nHow Budgeting Can Lead to Better Decision Making\n\nA good budget is more than just a list of numbers. It is a strong tool for planning and making better choices. When you understand your finances well, you can use your resources in a smart way.\n\nFor example, you can find places to save money. This can help you have money available for new chances. This careful use of resources can help your growth and meet your business goals. In the end, a strong budget helps you make smart, informed choices that match your main goals.\n\nKey Components of a Successful Business Budget\n\nA good business budget is clear and well-organized. It starts with a reasonable guess of income, including all possible ways to earn money. Then, it looks closely at expenses and sorts them into fixed and variable costs. Lastly, a complete budget will include a strategy for handling cash flow. This way, you can ensure you have enough money to cover your payments.\n\nRevenue Estimation: The Starting Point\n\nA clear revenue estimation is very important for your budget. Begin by finding all the ways your business makes money. This can include selling products or services, rental income, or any other way to earn money. Once you know where your money comes from, you should create sales forecasts. This means looking at past data, market trends, and the current economy to predict future sales. Analyzing the market helps you understand competition and how customers behave, which can improve your revenue estimates. Keep in mind that your revenue estimation should be based on solid data and realistic ideas.\n\nFixed vs. Variable Expenses: Balancing the Scales\n\nUnderstanding the distinction between fixed and variable expenses is essential for effective cost management. Fixed costs remain relatively consistent regardless of your sales volume, such as rent, salaries, or insurance premiums. On the other hand, variable costs fluctuate directly with sales, including raw materials, manufacturing costs, or sales commissions. Managing both types of costs is key to maintaining a healthy bottom line. Here’s a simple way to visualize the two:\n\nExpense Type Description Examples Fixed Costs Remain relatively constant regardless of sales volume Rent, salaries, insurance premiums Variable Costs Fluctuate in direct proportion to sales or production volume Raw materials, sales commissions, shipping costs\n\nPractical Steps to Create Your First Business Budget\n\nNow that you understand the main parts of a budget, it’s time to put that knowledge to use. Creating a budget can feel overwhelming, but you can simplify it into small steps. First, you need to set clear financial goals. Then, gather information about your income and expenses.\n\nIdentifying Your Business’s Financial Goals\n\nBefore looking at the numbers, take some time to define your business’s financial goals. What do you want to achieve with money in the short-term and long-term? Are you aiming to make more profit, invest in growth, or save cash? Clearly set your short-term goals, like raising sales by a certain amount this quarter. At the same time, detail your long-term goals, such as getting a certain share of the market or expanding into new areas in five years. Make sure your profit targets are specific and can be measured. This will help to keep everything in line with your overall business plan. These clear goals will guide you in making a budget and keep you focused on what is really important for your business’s success.\n\nTracking and Adjusting Your Budget Regularly\n\nCreating a budget is just the first step. After you make it, you should track your progress and change things if needed. Think of your budget as a living document. It needs regular checks and updates to stay useful. Here’s how to keep your budget on track:\n\nRegular Monitoring Expenses: Make it a routine to check your expenses often. You can do this weekly, every two weeks, or monthly, based on what your business needs and how many transactions you have.\n\nConduct Periodic Financial Reviews: Don’t only track expenses; do detailed financial reviews every month or every few months. This means looking at how your actual performance compares to the budget, calculating important financial ratios, and spotting any issues that need your attention.\n\nImplement Timely Adjustments: Feel free to change your budget when needed. The market can shift, unexpected costs can come up, and your business can change. Your budget should be flexible enough to handle these changes while keeping you focused on your financial goals.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat Is the 50/30/20 Rule in Budgeting and Can It Apply to Businesses?\n\nThe 50/30/20 rule is a guide for managing money. It suggests putting 50% of your income towards needs, 30% towards wants, and 20% for savings. While this rule doesn’t directly apply to businesses, its ideas about spending and saving can be used for business budgeting.",

As for coins, you’ll find 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 franc denominations.\n\nThe design of the Guinea franc changes with every issue, and there have been several commemorative editions to mark occasions like the 50th anniversary of the Guinea franc.\n\nThey all feature the Guinean coat of arms, as well as culturally significant images such as a banana harvest, Mount Nimba, the Kaleta hydroelectric dam, or a bauxite mine.\n\nIf you’re looking to exchange the Guinea franc for a foreign currency, you can use the currency code GNF to look it up on foreign exchange markets.\n\nWithin the country, you may see the abbreviations FG‎, Fr, or GFr to denote Guinean money.\n\nHistory of Guinea’s currency\n\nThe country that’s now Guinea has a shared history with other West African countries, with the Ghana, Mali, and Songhai empires all exerting their influence on the region from as early as the 3rd century.\n\nGold played a major role from the start, both for decorative purposes and as currency in the form of gold dust, wire, and nuggets.\n\nPortuguese traders established ports in the 15th century, and France claimed the territory as part of the French Empire in the late 1800s. The French military called the colony Rivières du Sud, meaning “southern rivers,” before changing the name to French Guinea.\n\nFrance introduced the CFA franc in 1945 to provide a common currency throughout its West and Central African territories, including Guinea. You’ll find other versions of this currency in countries like Senegal and Cameroon.\n\nAfter gaining its independence in 1958, the Republic of Guinea developed its own legal tender, and the first Guinea franc arrived on the scene in 1959.\n\n7 surprising facts about Guinean currency\n\nDue to its geographical location and natural resources, the Republic of Guinea has had a major role in the economy of the region—and an effect on other currencies of the world.\n\nHere are seven surprising facts about Guinea’s currency that you may not know:\n\n1. ‘Guinea’ is also the name of an old English coin.\n\nIf you hear someone mention a “Guinea coin” in a historical context, chances are they aren’t talking about the Guinea franc. The guinea is the name of a gold coin that was first minted in 1663 and used throughout the British Empire until 1814.\n\nSo, why was it called the guinea? They made the coin with gold from the Guinea region, and then it became the name of the coin itself.\n\nAt one point, a guinea was worth 21 shillings or 1.05 pounds. The guinea is no longer legal tender in the United Kingdom, but it was valid until Decimal Day in 1971, when decimalisation changed the way money was represented in the U.K. system.\n\n2. The Republic of Guinea previously used the CFA franc.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1958, Guinea used the French colonial currency, the CFA franc. After the end of the colonial period, the CFA franc evolved into two different currencies: the West African CFA franc and the Central African CFA franc.\n\nThese two currencies have the same value and are interchangeable in all 14 countries that use them. Since they’re pegged to the euro (EUR), they don’t float freely on global currency markets and have a fixed value of €1 to 655.957 CFA francs.\n\nThe Republic of Guinea, however, never joined the currency union that uses the CFA franc. It issues its own currency with its own free-floating exchange rate.\n\n3. There are no centimes in circulation.\n\nLike the CFA francs, one Guinea franc consists of 100 centimes—but you won’t find centimes anywhere in Guinea.\n\nThat’s because the value of the centime is so low that the Central Bank has never issued any denomination smaller than 1 GNF.\n\n4. Guinea briefly switched to the syli in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1971, the country introduced the syli, a currency made up of 100 cauris. Although the Central Bank issued syli coins and banknotes, at 10 francs to 1 syli, they didn’t last long: In 1985, Guinea switched back to the franc, with 1 franc equal to 1 syli.\n\n5. Guinea banknotes use the French language.\n\nIf you look at a Guinea banknote, you’ll notice that most of the writing is in French. For example, 20,000 francs is written as “vingt mille francs guinéens.”\n\nThis is because Guinea was a French territory until 1958. In fact, the official language of the Republic of Guinea is still French.\n\n6. A British printing house designed the early Guinean franc.\n\nDespite getting its name from French currency, several early print runs of the Guinean franc happened in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe iconic De La Rue printing house, which is the largest company of its kind in the world, designed an early set of banknotes.\n\nDe La Rue has worked with at least 140 countries and has designed over one-third of the world’s currency denominations.\n\n7. Guinean banknotes have numerous security features.\n\nIn addition to their beautiful designs, Guinean banknotes contain holographic patches, security strips, and other advanced features to prevent fraud.\n\nOver the years, these have included various watermarks, diamond-shaped patches, and the letters “RG” (Republic of Guinea) to denote their authenticity.\n\nUnderstanding Guinea franc exchange rates\n\nThe Guinea franc is a free-floating currency, which means its value fluctuates compared to other global currencies, such as the U.S. dollar (USD) or the Canadian dollar (CAD).\n\nIn recent years, Guinea’s economy has experienced high inflation—12.60% in 2021—but the country remains a major exporter of gold, bauxite, and other natural resources.\n\nIf you intend to travel to Guinea, you’ll likely want to take cash with you in your local currency and convert it to Guinea francs when you arrive, since ATMs have small withdrawal limits and credit card transactions are rare.\n\nYou can also use a money transfer service to send money to Guinea, with options for receiving funds via a bank deposit, mobile money, or cash pickup.\n\nSend money to Guinea from overseas\n\nWhen you need to send funds to loved ones in Guinea, Remitly makes it easy with a secure mobile app and transparent transaction fees.\n\nYou can send your transfer with a debit card or credit card and track it every step of the way.\n\nDownload the app, and we’ll show you how to get started today.\n\nFurther reading",

This helps adapt to changing market conditions and keeps it relevant.\n\nA business plan is an important document for any small business or new business idea. It serves as a complete roadmap that shows the company’s goals, strategies, and how it plans to reach its market. A good business plan helps attract potential investors, get loans, and guide the business toward success.\n\nUnderstanding the Basics of a Business Plan\n\nA business plan is a written document that explains a company’s goals and how it plans to reach them. It includes details about the business’s operations, target market, competitive position, financial projections, and future plans.\n\nThis plan is not just a fixed paper; it serves as a guide that changes as the business grows. It should be checked and updated often to match changes in the market, industry, and the company’s own operations.\n\nDefining a Business Plan and Its Purpose\n\nA business plan is a basic document that shows what a business wants to achieve and explains how it will get there. It acts as a guide for the company, helping with its daily work, decisions, and plans for growth. A good business plan clearly describes the company’s value proposition, highlighting the special products or services it brings to the market.\n\nOne main purpose of a business plan is to win investment. Potential investors and lenders use business plans to judge if a business opportunity is good and if it can make money. A detailed and interesting business plan shows the chances for profit, what makes the business special, and the strengths of its management team.\n\nAlso, a business plan is important not just for outside stakeholders but also for the people inside the company. It helps to get everyone working towards the same mission statement, goals, and objectives. When everyone knows their roles and responsibilities, as stated in the business plan, it creates unity and gives a sense of purpose.\n\nThe Importance of a Business Plan in Today’s Economy\n\nIn today’s changing and often uncertain economy, having a strong business plan is very important. It gives you direction and purpose during tough times. A good business plan should have clear financial projections and a complete market analysis. This way, businesses can adjust to market changes and make smart choices.\n\nAlso, a business plan is key for getting funding.

It is a strategy for survival. It helps businesses handle economic challenges, take advantage of new chances, and stay ahead of their competitors.\n\nThe Anatomy of a Business Plan\n\nA complete business plan usually has several important sections. Each section covers a key part of the business. Together, they create a clear view of the company, how it works, its market, and how it can grow and earn profit.\n\nBusiness plans can be different in length and complexity. This depends on the type and size of the business. However, all business plans have some common parts. These parts help readers, especially potential investors, understand the business opportunity better.\n\nExecutive Summary: Your Business’s First Impression\n\nThe executive summary is one of the most important parts of your business plan. It’s the first thing potential investors and lenders will read. This section should give a short but compelling overview of your business to grab the reader’s attention right away. It typically should be no more than one page and must highlight the key points of your business idea and its potential for success.\n\nA good executive summary gives a brief but clear look at your business idea. It should describe the problem your business solves, your solution, and your target market. It should also mention your competitive advantage, or what makes your business different from others.\n\nMoreover, your executive summary should provide a quick overview of your business model. This includes how you will make money and your pricing strategy. It should also offer a snapshot of your team’s expertise, showing the skills and experience that you bring.\n\nCompany Description: What You Do and Why It Matters\n\nThe company description gives deeper information about your business. It covers your operations, business model, and long-term goals. This is a chance to expand on the key points from your executive summary. You can also share more about your company’s purpose and dreams.\n\nThis section should clearly explain the problem your business will solve. It should also detail your value proposition.

This shows your commitment to your goals and values.\n\nCrafting Your Business Strategy\n\nA strong business strategy is important for dealing with the challenges of the market and growing in a lasting way. This part should explain how you will get customers, beat competitors, and set your business up for future success.\n\nYour strategy should come from a clear understanding of your target market, your industry, and the competition.

Market research plays a big role in this. It gives you useful information about what competitors are doing, their pricing, and how customers see them.\n\nStart by finding both your direct and indirect competitors. Direct competitors sell similar products or services to the same customers. Indirect competitors provide different solutions to similar problems. After you find your competitors, examine their pricing, how they sell their products, their marketing methods, and what customers have to say.\n\nThe aim of competitive analysis is to find your competitive advantage.

Explain how these processes work together to make your daily operations run smoothly and efficiently.\n\nProduct or Service Line: Detailing What You Offer\n\nThis section lets you show your product lines or services in detail.

It will give a clear picture of your company’s financial health and path forward.\n\nFinancial Projections and Funding Requirements\n\nFinancial projections are essential for demonstrating the viability and potential profitability of your business to potential investors. These projections should include key financial ratios and metrics, such as your gross profit margin, operating profit margin, and net profit margin, showcasing the financial soundness of your business model.\n\nYour funding requirements should be clearly outlined, stating the amount of capital you need to raise to launch and grow your business.

Set realistic but ambitious sales goals. Check your progress regularly and adjust your strategy if needed.\n\nRealizing Your Vision\n\nTo turn your business idea into reality, you need more than a good plan. You need a clear vision, strong determination, and the ability to change with the market.

These milestones can include hitting a specific revenue target, moving into new markets, or starting new product lines.\n\nSetting Goals and Milestones\n\nSetting clear and measurable goals is very important for guiding your business. Your goals need to be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. This is known as SMART. By creating SMART goals, you can track how you are doing, celebrate your wins, and keep your eyes on your long-term vision.\n\nMilestones are important steps to reach your overall business goals. They help break big objectives into smaller, easier tasks. This gives you a clear path for your business development and growth.\n\nIt’s important to check and update your goals and milestones regularly as your business changes. Make sure to celebrate your successes, but also be ready to change direction if surprises come up or new chances appear in the market.\n\nRisks and Challenges: Preparing for Potential Hurdles\n\nEvery business has risks and challenges. These can come from inside or outside the company. Finding these possible obstacles early helps you make backup plans. This shows potential investors that you understand the risks and are ready to handle them.\n\nThink about economic downturns, changes in the industry, shifts in what customers want, or more competition. You should have strategies to reduce these risks. Some ideas include offering different products, looking at new markets, or keeping a good amount of cash on hand.\n\nMake sure to check and update your risk assessment often. Adjust your business plan as needed to keep up with changing market conditions and new challenges.\n\nThe Evolving Business Plan\n\nA business plan is not just a simple document. It is a guide that needs to grow as your business grows. As you collect more data, gain market experience, and hear from customers, you should adjust and improve your strategies. This helps you stay competitive and relevant.\n\nChecking your business plan often helps you see how you are doing. You can look at how well your strategies work and make any needed changes to keep moving forward. Make time to go over your plan with your team. Analyze your performance and find areas where you can improve.\n\nAdapting to Market Changes\n\nMarket conditions are always changing. They are affected by many things, like shifts in the economy, new technology, laws, and what consumers want. A business plan that is too strict and doesn’t adjust to these external factors will not last long.\n\nIt is very important to change your strategies to remain successful over the long run. Do regular market research to keep an eye on industry trends, examine what your competitors are doing, and understand changes in consumer behavior. Be flexible and ready to change your strategies if needed. See changes as chances to grow and innovate.\n\nKeep in mind that your business plan is like a map. Sometimes, taking a different route can lead to the best places. Accept that business involves changes and be willing to adjust your plans to grab new opportunities and tackle unexpected issues.\n\nWhen and How to Update Your Business Plan\n\nThe need to update your business plan really depends on what your company needs and where it is in its growth stage. However, it is usually a good idea to do a full review of your business plan once a year. This yearly check-up should cover a deep look at the market, how your finances are doing, and how well your overall business strategy is working.\n\nBesides the yearly review, think about updating your plan more often if you are seeing big growth, starting new products or services, moving into new markets, or facing unexpected issues or chances. Regular check-ins on your plan help make sure it stays up-to-date, reflects your current goals, and matches your overall business strategy.\n\nKeeping your business plan up to date should not seem overwhelming. Take it as a chance to look back at your progress, rethink your goals, and polish your strategies to stay ahead.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow Often Should a Business Plan Be Updated?\n\nThe best time to update your business plan depends on what type of business you have and its current stage. Most businesses should review their plans once a year. However, if the market changes or your business goals shift greatly, you might need to adjust your plan more often.\n\nCan a Business Plan Guarantee Success?\n\nA business plan does not assure success, but it can greatly improve your odds. It offers a plan for smart thinking and action. However, being able to adjust to market changes and truly knowing what makes you successful are key to reaching your goals.\n\nWhat Are the Most Common Mistakes in Business Plans?\n\nCommon mistakes in business plans are often unrealistic financial projections, not enough market analysis, missing the competition, and having goals that are too high. Doing careful research and making realistic projections are important for a solid plan.",
      "# [5 Facts about the Cambodian Riel That You May Not Know by Evelyne Kuo on 2023-11-01](https://blog.remitly.com/currencies/cambodian-riel/)\nAre you traveling to Cambodia or sending money home? You might need to turn your USD, euros, pounds, or other currency into Cambodian riel.\n\nAre you only looking for the current riel to dollar (or dollar to riel) exchange rate? Here’s today’s rate with Remitly.\n\nLearn more about Cambodian riel rates, facts, and tips in this guide—whether you send money to Southeast Asia or plan to visit soon.\n\nThe overview of Cambodian riel\n\nThe official currency of Cambodia is the Cambodian riel, and its currency code is KHR (៛). Its sub-units are the sen (one-hundredth of a riel) and the kak (one-tenth of a riel). The coins in circulation are in the following denominations:\n\n50 riels, 100 riels\n\n200 riels\n\n500 riels\n\nAlso in circulation are banknotes of:\n\n50 riels\n\n100 riels\n\n500 riels\n\n1,000 riels\n\n2,000 riels\n\n5,000 riels\n\n10,000 riels\n\n15,000 riels\n\n20,000 riels\n\n50,000 riels\n\n5 facts about the Cambodian riel\n\n1. Riel notes showcase Cambodia’s rich history.\n\nFrom the smallest bill to the largest, each Cambodian riel note showcases a different Cambodian landmark or cultural icon. Many notes feature Cambodian cultural and historical sites and architecture on one side and a cultural icon or member of the royal family on the other.\n\nThe smallest note (50 riels) features the temple Banteay Srei on one side and the Gate of Tek Thla on the other.\n\nThe largest note (50,000 riels) features King Norodom Sihanouk on one side and the Bakong Temple on the other.\n\nThe 20,000 riel note features one of Cambodia’s most popular landmarks, Angkor Wat.\n\n2. There have been two different currencies used in Cambodia.\n\nWhile the riel is the official currency of Cambodia, there have been two distinct riels in the country since independence from France.\n\nThe first riel was issued between 1953 and May 1975.\n\nThe country had no monetary system during the period of political and social strife of the Cambodian Civil War and the Khmer Rouge regime, from 1975 to 1980.\n\nThe second, and current, riel has been in the issue since March 1980. Since the 1990s, Cambodians have used the riel alongside the U.S. dollar.\n\n3. Cambodians usually don’t use coins.\n\nCambodia’s rich history also extends to its historical use of coins. Once prized for their artistry, craftsmanship, and use of precious materials, the modern Cambodian economy is primarily based on banknotes. While coins are still in circulation, they are rarely used. Instead, most of the currency is printed on bills.\n\nAfter years of civil war and the abolishment of money during the Khmer Rouge regime, Cambodia’s economy could no longer support coins as currency and people lost the habit of using them.\n\n4. The U.S. dollar is common and in circulation in Cambodia.\n\nWhile the official currency of Cambodia is the riel (KHR), the country also widely uses the U.S. dollar. So much so, in fact, that many of the country’s ATM machines allow for withdrawals in USD. Experts estimate that the dollar accounts for 83% of the total transactions and more than 90% of banking deposits.\n\nForeign currency is more commonly used in transactions in tourist and urban areas. Businesses are likely to list prices in USD. In rural areas, where the use of riel is more common, it might be hard to break a $20 bill.\n\nCambodian ATMs dispense both USD and Cambodian riels, but foreign travelers may only be able to draw from their foreign accounts in USD. Double-check before you travel to Cambodia.\n\n5. The riel has a relatively fixed USD exchange rate.\n\nThe reintroduction of the riel in 1980 saw a fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar, setting the value at 4 riels to $1. Since then, the relative values of the two currencies have diverged. The KHR is a free-floating currency but has lost a large degree of value against other major currencies in recent decades. While the official exchange rate may change, it is common now to see exchange rates of 4,000 KHR to 1 USD when buying products from small vendors.\n\nMore about Cambodia\n\nCambodia is a country in Southeast Asia bordering Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam. The country is largely rural (with over 75% of the population living in rural areas), but the influences of many Asian cultures alongside those of France and the United States can be seen throughout the country and its capital, Phnom Penh.\n\nFor 2,000 years, Cambodia’s civilization absorbed influences from India and China due to trade on the Mekong, transferring them to other Southeast Asian civilizations in the process. The country is now known for its massive temple complexes built during the Khmer empire (12th century), such as Angkor Wat and Kayon.\n\nCambodia became a French colony in 1863 and experienced upheaval and turmoil in the 20th century as a result of Japanese occupation during World War II, post-war independence, and political instability.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1979, the country was devastated by the reign of the Khmer Rouge. Cambodia began the process of political and social recovery during a period under a Vietnamese-backed regime from 1979 to 1989. In the 1990s, Cambodia regained its political autonomy, reestablished a constitutional government, and has since experienced steady economic growth and prosperity.\n\nThe main religion in the country is Buddhism, with notable Muslim and Christian minority populations.",

Many bills feature leaders in the Colombian arts (and more).\n\n1,000 pesos – leader of the Socialist movement and presidential candidate Jorge Eliécer Gaitán\n\n2,000 – renowned artist Débora Arango\n\n5,000 – poet José Asunción Silva\n\n10,000 – notable anthropologist Virginia Gutiérrez\n\n20,000 – The 24th Colombian president, Alfonso López Michelsen\n\n50,000 – Nobel-prize winning author Gabriel García Márquez\n\n100,000 – The 22nd Colombian president, Carlos Lleras Restrepo\n\n2. Two different peso designs are in use today.\n\nIf you find yourself in Colombia, you might see slight differences among the bills.\n\nWhen the national bank started creating pesos with larger denominations, they changed the visuals on the bills. The original printed design read “50,000” in numerals. Newer peso banknotes display “50 thousand” instead.\n\n3. You may get VAT refunds if you spend Colombian pesos.\n\nIf you’re visiting Colombia, you might be eligible for a VAT refund when you spend money there. Wondering what this means? A VAT refund returns some tax money paid by non-residents for certain goods.\n\nIn Colombia, these goods include:\n\nLocal crafts\n\nToys\n\nLinens\n\nHousehold appliances\n\nFootwear\n\nLeather goods\n\nJewelry\n\nYou can pursue this process at the DIAN (National Tax and Customs Department). You’ll need to fill out an application along with other paperwork. Just make sure that you have your passport and receipt for the goods that you’ve bought with Colombian pesos.\n\n4. One edition of the $50,000 peso is vertical.\n\nA unique feature of the older $50,000 peso is that its imagery is vertical. Jorge Isaacs is featured on this bill. Isaacs is a famous Colombian writer best known for his work María.\n\nThis is not only different from the rest of the Colombian peso banknotes, but it is different from most global currencies. Most bills across the world have the picture printed horizontally.\n\nThe 50,000 peso banknote has since been updated as of 2016 with a horizontal image of the writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez.\n\n5. Special features prevent the spread of counterfeit money.\n\nThe citizens of Colombia voiced concerns about the rise of counterfeit money, so the Banco de la República issued a statement emphasizing the unique security features Colombian pesos have to prevent this from happening. These features include:\n\nSecurity thread\n\nWatermark\n\nMatching images\n\nColor-shifting images with motion effects\n\nUnderstanding Colombian Currency Exchange Rates\n\nExchange rates vary due to political and economic factors. A quick online search will lead you to easy currency converter tools to check today’s rate. Common COP rate searches include those for converting the peso to the American dollar (USD), the Canadian dollar (CAD), the euro (EUR), the Australian dollar (AUD), the British pound (GBP), the Swiss franc, and the Chinese yuan.\n\nCheck the current rates with Remitly in our app or on our website.\n\nWhile exchange rates vary, as mentioned, you can get a feel for what to expect by checking historical rates. Foreign exchange sites like Oanda or FXTOP offer charts that make these calculations easy.\n\nFor instance, FXTOP shows that the average exchange rate for USD to COP from December 10, 2018 to December 10, 2021 has been 3,561.1 pesos to one U.S. dollar.\n\nIf you want to know more, browse our guide to the getting the best Colombian peso rates.\n\nSending Money to Colombia\n\nSending money to Colombia is a fairly simple process when you use the right service. With money transfer apps like Remitly, you can easily send funds to family and friends in Colombia. You can also send money to yourself.\n\nHave a look at our website or download the app, and we’ll walk you through how to send money to Colombia.\n\nMore about Money in Colombia\n\nYou’ll find that in major cities and tourist hotspots in Colombia, you can get away with using cash or credit and debit cards. ATMs are also widely available and often have better rates than those you’ll get at an airport exchange counter. These cities include:\n\nBogotá\n\nSanta Marta\n\nBarranquilla\n\nCali\n\nMedellín\n\nCartagena\n\nSan Andrés\n\nPereira\n\nBucaramanga\n\nColombian pesos in the form of cash might be the only form of payment in more rural areas in Colombia. The U.S. dollar may also be accepted, even though it’s not an official currency there."

On the 2nd day, customer service to wait for another 24 hours. 3rd day came, I reach them again only to be told, “well, nobody has reviewed your transaction” and all they can do is make a report. Nothing to escalate the transfer properly. How is that the consumer’s fault? \n\nAlso, I’ve noticed their exchange rates before was better than other apps. But now, no more.

Some transactions are reviewed which is understandable, but they promise a review of within 24 hours. I have waited for a transaction of mine to go through after being reviewed (which was weird because it was petty cash compared to my other transactions). They said 24 hours, but mine took 3 days. On the 2nd day, customer service to wait for another 24 hours. 3rd day came, I reach them again only to be told, “well, nobody has reviewed your transaction” and all they can do is make a report. Nothing to escalate the transfer properly. How is that the consumer’s fault? \n\nAlso, I’ve noticed their exchange rates before was better than other apps. But now, no more. As of today, they are 55php per dollar while other apps are 57-58php per dollar with same transaction fee.",

I immediately used the credit and vowed not to use their service again.\n\n\n\nEDIT: I submitted complaints via the BBB and CFBP shortly after my original post.\n\nToday 1/12/2023 the status of the transaction magically changed from \"completed\" to on hold.\n\nI called and Remitly couldn't tell me why the transaction was on hold or why they had initially marked it as completed to begin with.\n\nAfter reconfirming that all the information was correct their resolution was to change the \"banking partner\" on the transaction to a different banking partner. I asked who the previous one was and who the new one would be and the rep said he couldn't share that info. Mind you I have been asking about these \"banking partners\" since the beginning because something about the whole thing seems fishy but Remitly won't share who these partners are and what they do exactly.\n\nAnyways instead of doing that I asked to cancel the transaction so I can get a refund. As soon as the money is back in my account I'm resending using my bank's wire transfer and I'm closing the Remitly account for good. I don't need these headaches in my life.\n\nTLDR; I sent a transaction of more than $3,000. Remitly didn't deliver the money but are claiming that they did. Every time I call they tell me they'll escalate the case and conduct an investigation. It's been 2 weeks and they keep telling me the same thing.\n\n\n\nOn 12/28/2023 1 initiated a transfer of $3154.57 from my US account to my international\n\naccount.\n\nOn 1/03/2024 I received a notification that the transfer had been completed. As of 1/10/2024, the money has not been delivered to the account.\n\nI have called Remitly on 8 different occations and have been told different stories about what's going on, including:\n\n* The transaction is complete and I'm incorrect\n* My bank is closed(lt's not)\n* Remitly is conducting an investigation and I'll hear back in 24 hours(l haven't)\n\nI have provived Remitly with copies of my official bank statement that clearly show the money was never received. Depending on who picks up the phone or chat, the Remitly rep states either of the following:\n\n* They spoke with my bank and my bank told them the money was deposited into my\n\naccount\n\n* They are doing an investigation(again)\n\nI have checked with my bank multiple times and they have told m e they have not been contacted by Remitly, and they have no received any funds from them so Remitly is clearly lying and refusing to provide any useful information. I have asked Remitly repeatedly to provide me with the emails they claim to have received from my bank stating the funds were deposited but they can't/won't. I have also asked to speak with the \"internal department\" conducting the investigation but have been told that I can't speak with them and that they will contact me once the investigation is completed.\n\nLast week I was told the investigation would be completed and I would get a resolution today 1/10/2024. When I called today I was told all of the above again and now they are\n\nsupposedly conducting a new investigation...\n\nI just filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau but other than that I don't know what I can do here.

Basically, if your full name and/or other information doesn't closely match, that could be part of the issue. Not saying it is, but very commonly people move and don't promptly update their state id / driver's license, etc. One is supposed to even if they just move down the street. While states generally don't enforce such stuff, it causes problems with automated verification many services use.\n\nIf your full name matches up and not moved at all, then something else triggered the review. Even how you accessed the website, such as through a VPN. Don't know if they have an app, but if using that, maybe had location turned off, which many sites utilize for additional fraud screening.\n\nBBB is a good start. See how that goes, but don't wait too long. If by end of week no progress, file a complaint with CFPB.\n\n## Comment ID khebnja with +1 score by [(Old_Gap_6174, Reddit, 2024-01-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Banking/comments/193cs4k/remitly_just_took_my_3000_dollars_what_can_i_do/khebnja/) (in reply to ID 193cs4k):\nHi u/notdoreen, I'm sorry to hear about the issues you're facing with Remitly.

They paused the transfer and I had to speak with \"security\"..The man grilled me for over half and hour..who was I sending it to (a gift for Christmas) was he family (he was a fried) ?  What was he using it for? , what was my source of income? (I gave an answer..and also said I was retired).  Who was my previous employer?  Would I be sending money again etc.?  This was a major credit card.  I have an excellent credit rating. They wanted a PDF of my last bank statement which I did send in the end. He could have asked for that in the beginning instead of putting me through an interrogation.  I  later spoke with customer service to see if the pause could be released and she started talking about how they were doing this for my safety etc. sending money to someone I had never met..and  I said I had met this person.  I had visited him and his family in Brazil.  Where did she get that idea I had never met him?  Why was asking about my employment not an invasion of my privacy.  It was an absurd hour long struggle to finally get the money sent.  I told her I would never use Remitly ever again.  I plan to stick to that.  I will never use them nor recommend them.

Very weird. So if you only get bank statements once a month, you need to find a way to download a transaction list.\n\n\nI don't know if that's going to work because I couldn't download a transaction list on mobile that had bank letterhead.\n\n\nOh... But canceling the transaction in the middle isn't easy - it will tie up your funds while someone from customer service writes to Remitly's partner bank.

They require more frequent sign-in and more frequent verification codes.  They require a picture of my identification and a selfie of myself.

This is what happened to me, so be careful with your reservations. \n\nLast week I received an email from \"noreply@booking.com\" containing all my reservation details and stating that I had to access a link to enter my card details in order to validate it.\n \nIf I had not entered my card details, I would have lost the reservation - it was also stated in this email. \n\nAfter entering and validating the payment (which was said to be refunded in a few seconds) nothing happened and then the person who obtained my card details tried to take money from my card again but I realized what was happening and refused a second payment. \n\nAt that point, from a \"support\" pop-up opened on the payment site I was asked what the available balance in the account was. \n\nIn the meantime I contacted both booking.com and the accommodation and received the following answers:\n\n- the hotel says they didn't receive any money from me, obviously\n- booking.com says they are very sorry about the situation, that the email did not come from them, that my private data was leaked and so the hackers could compose that email with my reservation details and I have to check with my bank to block my payment and get a refund.\n\n## Comment ID kj6a3lv with +171 score by [(lucapal1, Reddit, 2024-01-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/19dk51w/bookingcom_email_scam_fraud_card_validation/kj6a3lv/) (in reply to ID 19dk51w):\nThere have been a lot of posts on here about this, over the last few months.\n\nAnyway good to warn anyone who may still be unaware!\n\n### Comment ID kj7m0ga with +41 score by [(Expensive_Pin5399, Reddit, 2024-01-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/19dk51w/bookingcom_email_scam_fraud_card_validation/kj7m0ga/) (in reply to ID kj6a3lv):\nThese are hacked hotels.

I've been charged 265 euros, and now Revolut doesn't want to refund the amount, and I'm waiting for a response from booking. It's a shitty situation because the message with the link looked legit, and after entering the link it had the interface of the booking app like when you pay for any accommodation via booking.

Albeit this was 10 years ago, I had three serious problems with them related to fraud in a short period. After that I was done using them for anything other than research. \n\nTwice, they changed the date of my flight. I’m incredibly obsessive about checking and double checking flight details. Everything looked good. I clicked book, and then suddenly the flight was on a different day. Of course, no way to cancel online, so I spent 50-60 mins on the phone running around in circles (by design) until I finally managed to cancel. The next time I used booking.com I checked super super carefully. Remembering the last time. And then it happened again, where they for sure changed the date of my flights to “get a better deal.”  Nah man, won’t do it again. \n\nThe biggest issue was when I used one of booking.com’s companies to book a car in Montenegro. They quoted me a very low rate (maybe half as the official rate through Avis), and sold me an auto insurance policy that supposedly had a 1500 USD deductible. Great deal, I thought. When I get to the country, the Avis folks tell me that the insurance is invalid and that I’m renting the car on some extremely bare bones rate where I basically will have a 10k EUR deductible in the event of damage. Now it occurred to me at the time that perhaps this was just the Avis people trying to rip me off and sell me a more expensive car. But I actually got pulled over for speeding (72 kph in a 60 lol) and asked the police about the insurance policy, and they confirmed that that other insurance was invalid. (I did have other super basic coverage with a 10k EUR deductible lol). But yeah either through incompetence or willful fraud, booking.com hooked me up with an insurance policy that didn’t even provide coverage. \n\nGlad you’ve had good experiences with them, but best of luck.\n\n## Comment ID ksv1jlv with +2 score by [(Tuukkis, Reddit, 2024-03-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/19dk51w/bookingcom_email_scam_fraud_card_validation/ksv1jlv/) (in reply to ID 19dk51w):\nAny luck on getting refunds if you fell for this?\n\n### Comment ID ksw0pv9 with +1 score by [(Kind_Battle_2362, Reddit, 2024-03-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/19dk51w/bookingcom_email_scam_fraud_card_validation/ksw0pv9/) (in reply to ID ksv1jlv):\nAfter 4-5 hours total spent in call centre with 4-5 different people i finally found someone to admit it's mostly bookings fault and they refunded me\n\n#### Comment ID kszahh9 with +2 score by [(Tuukkis, Reddit, 2024-03-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/19dk51w/bookingcom_email_scam_fraud_card_validation/kszahh9/) (in reply to ID ksw0pv9):\nOkay, I might just give that a shot, thanks mate.\n\n## Comment ID lb8yoxu with +1 score by [(That_Lad_Hayden, Reddit, 2024-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/19dk51w/bookingcom_email_scam_fraud_card_validation/lb8yoxu/) (in reply to ID 19dk51w):\nI got something similar.

It's free at fidelity. Exchange rate is determined by the receiving bank in India.

I’ve never had any issues with transfers, and their tracking is pretty accurate. One feature I love (not sure if Remitly has this) is that Wise gives you both physical and virtual cards. This has been a game-changer for me when traveling. It’s super convenient to have one card and switch between different currencies on the go—definitely a nice bonus!\n\n## Comment ID lqayfdn with +1 score by [(money-money-11, Reddit, 2024-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nri/comments/1fuqj1l/best_and_worst_platform_to_send_money_to_india/lqayfdn/) (in reply to ID 1fuqj1l):\nI have been using Wise for last 6 years.

In these you have to open an account, deposit USD, and then remit to Indian account. Very high limit about 1 million per year.

      "# Post ID 1gfste8: REMITLY Problem. Failed to work. Is it a scam? with +2 score by [(CuriousMushroom1143, Reddit, 2024-10-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nri/comments/1gfste8/remitly_problem_failed_to_work_is_it_a_scam/)\nIt's from this group posts about money transfer platforms that I narrowed it down to Remitly - to use to send money to India. BUT, at the other end, my poor recipient went to multiple of the places Remitly listed as \"partners\" but at each, they did not have the cash, nor did they know what my recipient was talking about. She showed them transaction number and Remitly's texts & emails but that didn't help at all. With both failed attempts, I called Remitly's America number tied to an American address but call routed to India. Each time, stock emails from Remitly talking about investigating the situation! Then after second attempt to collect cash from a different partner bank also failed, I called for a refund and though I have an email attesting to that, at this point I'm wondering if that'll actually happen! Both times, they've been non-chalant about the whole thing. Credit card company suggested they start a fraud investigation but I've refrained so far but this does feel very scammy. \n\n## Comment ID lukbvzx with +2 score by [(VaikomViking, Reddit, 2024-10-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nri/comments/1gfste8/remitly_problem_failed_to_work_is_it_a_scam/lukbvzx/) (in reply to ID 1gfste8):\nUse Wise next time, their customer service is excellent.\n\n### Comment ID luke7wz with +1 score by [(Naina1611, Reddit, 2024-10-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nri/comments/1gfste8/remitly_problem_failed_to_work_is_it_a_scam/luke7wz/) (in reply to ID lukbvzx):\nHave you tried their cash pickup service ?

On the 2nd day, customer service to wait for another 24 hours. 3rd day came, I reach them again only to be told, “well, nobody has reviewed your transaction” and all they can do is make a report. Nothing to escalate the transfer properly. How is that the consumer’s fault? \n\nAlso, I’ve noticed their exchange rates before was better than other apps. But now, no more.

          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "Product/business \r\nCore product is not up to par with competitors. PMs get the blame for this, but 1) leadership is unclear on its priorities 2) Many Engineering teams have been understaffed (1-3 engineers for core parts of the product) for years. Choice to move many Engineering teams to cheaper markets (Poland, elsewhere) has strained communication between Engineering &amp; US-based PMs and the organization has been slow to do anything to respond to complaints about the risk &amp; inefficiency this creates. New initiatives have all fizzled so far (though maybe it’s good that the business is willing to recognize a sunk cost fallacy, at some point). \r\n\r\nData \r\nUnclear what the relationship between Data Engineering/ML Analytics is supposed to be. The leadership of the former does their own thing and only brings in Analytics when their plans are 90% done. No VP+ role in data, no career progression for Data Scientists, roles not aligned to industry standards. Just not a mature organization from a data standpoint. \r\n\r\nCustomer Centricity \r\nIt seems like the business is getting further away from customers, not closer. Passbook (closed neobank initiative) was targeted at Mexican immigrants to the US, but run by an all-white team. North America markets drive the business, but over the past year, now very few people in the Business team have ever lived in North America (no one in leadership; run from London). Understanding of customer needs, lives is super uneven across teams.\r\n\r\n Leadership \r\nAlmost everyone is in their first-ever C-level role. “Stay paranoid” attitude is not playing out in a healthy way. Infighting, scapegoating, excusing bad behavior &amp; mismanagement for favorite directors/VPs is spilling over and corrupting the great culture the company was known for in recent years. \r\n\r\nHR\r\n Chaotic. Rife with personal conflicts, toxic personalities allowed to flourish. Turnover is incredibly high in the recruiting, HR Business Partner, and HR ops groups. HR representatives seem to be lacking in some core training around employee conflict resolution, DEI, even labor laws (some HR reps supervise staff in multiple countries). Tendency is for HR reps to make immediate problems go away for Management at the expense of protecting the company. If you’re Level 4 or below, asking HR for help will probably only make things worse.\r\n\r\n DEI \r\n“Diverse” candidates be warned. The fact that most of the DEI team left this year tells you what you need to know. Smooth-talking men from well-represented backgrounds &amp; elite schools are strongly encouraged to apply. The company has plenty of data on how bad attrition for women, POC, and people who have taken FMLA is at &amp; above Level 3, they just won’t talk about it. Is it worse than other corporations? TBD, but it’s certainly not better. The progress the former DEI team was making stalled out around IPO time. Being in an employee resource group, particularly in leadership, can feel like wearing a “Troublemaker” label. \r\n\r\nGender: Most engineering teams are all men; where there’s a woman on the team, she’s definitely the one being asked to do all of the team lunch reservations. Women can enjoy the comments about how great their smile is, how emotional they are, but how they’re not very strategic in their performance reviews. It's definitely not like this in every team, but these things happen way more often than they should, and employees have no recourse when they do.  Men can get satisfactory performance reviews for shipping nothing, so long as their boss likes them. Underperforming men leave when they get new external jobs. High-performing women get assigned additional tasks like mentoring, recruiting, cultural centricity promotion, &amp; emotional labor-type work that the company will never reward, and then be told they did not drive enough business value at their next review. The departure rate for women at L3 and above (across functions) has visibly accelerated since Q4 2022. Multiple well-respected women who have complained about gender bias issues in the past year have mysteriously had their roles eliminated. \r\n\r\nRace: Management has expressed skepticism that ‘diverse’ teams can actually “perform” to managers that make an effort to make the company more representative of the customer base (immigrants). Only a few VP+ leaders are past the ‘I don’t see race and gender’ and ‘I have a black friend/I have a daughter’ level on their DEI learning. \r\n\r\nFMLA &amp; Disability, new parents: As another review said, if you need disability accommodations, good luck. Nursing mothers pressured to do non-essential travel, managers told that covid illnesses are not an acceptable reason to push back non-business-critical work. New mothers have had it made clear to them that having a baby and taking leave is the reason they weren’t promoted.",

A lot of people really do want to do right by their colleagues, but more and more, incentives don't encourage that.

        "cons": "Product/business \r\nCore product is not up to par with competitors. PMs get the blame for this, but 1) leadership is unclear on its priorities 2) Many Engineering teams have been understaffed (1-3 engineers for core parts of the product) for years. Choice to move many Engineering teams to cheaper markets (Poland, elsewhere) has strained communication between Engineering &amp; US-based PMs and the organization has been slow to do anything to respond to complaints about the risk &amp; inefficiency this creates. New initiatives have all fizzled so far (though maybe it’s good that the business is willing to recognize a sunk cost fallacy, at some point). \r\n\r\nData \r\nUnclear what the relationship between Data Engineering/ML Analytics is supposed to be. The leadership of the former does their own thing and only brings in Analytics when their plans are 90% done. No VP+ role in data, no career progression for Data Scientists, roles not aligned to industry standards. Just not a mature organization from a data standpoint. \r\n\r\nCustomer Centricity \r\nIt seems like the business is getting further away from customers, not closer. Passbook (closed neobank initiative) was targeted at Mexican immigrants to the US, but run by an all-white team. North America markets drive the business, but over the past year, now very few people in the Business team have ever lived in North America (no one in leadership; run from London). Understanding of customer needs, lives is super uneven across teams.\r\n\r\n Leadership \r\nAlmost everyone is in their first-ever C-level role. “Stay paranoid” attitude is not playing out in a healthy way. Infighting, scapegoating, excusing bad behavior &amp; mismanagement for favorite directors/VPs is spilling over and corrupting the great culture the company was known for in recent years. \r\n\r\nHR\r\n Chaotic. Rife with personal conflicts, toxic personalities allowed to flourish. Turnover is incredibly high in the recruiting, HR Business Partner, and HR ops groups. HR representatives seem to be lacking in some core training around employee conflict resolution, DEI, even labor laws (some HR reps supervise staff in multiple countries). Tendency is for HR reps to make immediate problems go away for Management at the expense of protecting the company. If you’re Level 4 or below, asking HR for help will probably only make things worse.\r\n\r\n DEI \r\n“Diverse” candidates be warned. The fact that most of the DEI team left this year tells you what you need to know. Smooth-talking men from well-represented backgrounds &amp; elite schools are strongly encouraged to apply. The company has plenty of data on how bad attrition for women, POC, and people who have taken FMLA is at &amp; above Level 3, they just won’t talk about it. Is it worse than other corporations? TBD, but it’s certainly not better. The progress the former DEI team was making stalled out around IPO time. Being in an employee resource group, particularly in leadership, can feel like wearing a “Troublemaker” label. \r\n\r\nGender: Most engineering teams are all men; where there’s a woman on the team, she’s definitely the one being asked to do all of the team lunch reservations. Women can enjoy the comments about how great their smile is, how emotional they are, but how they’re not very strategic in their performance reviews. It's definitely not like this in every team, but these things happen way more often than they should, and employees have no recourse when they do.  Men can get satisfactory performance reviews for shipping nothing, so long as their boss likes them. Underperforming men leave when they get new external jobs. High-performing women get assigned additional tasks like mentoring, recruiting, cultural centricity promotion, &amp; emotional labor-type work that the company will never reward, and then be told they did not drive enough business value at their next review. The departure rate for women at L3 and above (across functions) has visibly accelerated since Q4 2022. Multiple well-respected women who have complained about gender bias issues in the past year have mysteriously had their roles eliminated. \r\n\r\nRace: Management has expressed skepticism that ‘diverse’ teams can actually “perform” to managers that make an effort to make the company more representative of the customer base (immigrants). Only a few VP+ leaders are past the ‘I don’t see race and gender’ and ‘I have a black friend/I have a daughter’ level on their DEI learning. \r\n\r\nFMLA &amp; Disability, new parents: As another review said, if you need disability accommodations, good luck. Nursing mothers pressured to do non-essential travel, managers told that covid illnesses are not an acceptable reason to push back non-business-critical work. New mothers have had it made clear to them that having a baby and taking leave is the reason they weren’t promoted.",

Get a clear commitment from your hiring manager if you want remote or hybrid long-term \r\nData\r\n Altogether pretty clean and easy to work with, though there are big gaps on the product side\r\n\r\n People\r\n The golden age is over, but the company is still able to hire some pretty good resumes, and Seattle office probably still has a much lower jerk quotient than some other notable tech companies in the city (not sure this is stable though).  A lot of people really do want to do right by their colleagues, but more and more, incentives don't encourage that.

When we say \"you\" and \"your\" in this Agreement, that means you as the Remitly Account holder and user of the Service.\n\nYour Remitly Account. A Remitly Account is an account provided by Remitly that allows people who reside in the United States to send money transfers to people in other countries and regions. For avoidance of doubt, the Remitly Account is not a stored value account or other “balance” type account. You cannot hold funds in a Remitly Account.\n\nYou accept and agree to the terms of this Agreement (including all Policies) when you:\n\naccept the electronic version of this Agreement when the option is presented to you, such as when you register for the Remitly Service via our website or Mobile App; or\n\nstart using or attempt to use our Service, including if you access, download and/or use any of the Service.

A \"Transaction\" refers to an order from a Sender that instructs us to send money to a Recipient through the Service. The \"Transaction Amount\" is the amount in US dollars that the Sender provides to Remitly for transmittal to the Recipient. The \"Payout Amount\" is the amount paid out to the Recipient.\n\nThe Service should only be used to send money to people that you know and trust, such as family and friends.

We reserve the right to request additional information from you to verify your identity against third-party databases or through other sources, and to require you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address or Payment Instrument.\n\n6. SENDING A TRANSACTION\n\nGeneral. Using your Remitly Account, you can send money to a Recipient by providing us with information about you and a Recipient. You can send money to a Recipient, and a Recipient can receive funds sent by you, even if they do not have a Remitly Account or use the Service.\n\nProcessing Your Transactions. If you submit a Transaction, you are requesting that we process that Transaction. For you to initiate a Transaction through the Service and for us to process a Transaction on your behalf, you must provide us with information about a valid Payment Instrument that you want to use to fund your Transaction through your Remitly Account. If we are unable to process your Transaction using the Payment Instrument you select, we will notify you and request that you choose another Payment Instrument to complete your transaction. You agree that we may accept or reject your offer to process your Transaction under the terms of this Agreement. We are not under any obligation to carry out any Transaction that you request if, for example, you have broken any of your obligations set out in this Agreement.\n\nBank Account Payment Authorization. When you fund a Transaction and/or pay any Service Fees using your bank account as the Payment Instrument, you authorize the initiation of ACH debit or credit entries, as applicable, to that bank account in accordance with any payment instructions you provide, and the crediting of funds to your bank account for Transactions that are refunded, canceled or otherwise returned.\n\nCard Payment Authorization. When you fund a Transaction and/or pay any Service Fees using a credit or debit card, you authorize us, for the purpose of processing your Transaction, to debit or charge that Payment Instrument to fund the Transaction by the amount you specify, plus any Service Fees, and to send those funds to the designated Recipient immediately upon our receipt of the Transaction. You can withdraw your authorization for us to charge your debit or credit card by removing it from your Remitly Account. If your payment fails, you authorize us to re-try one or more times using the same debit or credit card, subject to limitations under applicable law.\n\nRemitly’s Liability. When you send a Transaction through our Service, it is your responsibility to make sure that all the Transaction details are complete, accurate, and correct (including, without limitation, the Recipient’s information and the Recipient’s banking or other account details) as we may not be able to let you change the details of your Transaction once it is submitted to us for processing.\n\nTo the extent allowed by law, you agree to be bound by all payment instructions or Transactions that are initiated through the Service from your Remitly Account. You must make sure that all payment instructions for your Transactions are correct and accurate.\n\nYou are solely responsible for entering the correct information for the Recipient to whom you are sending money. Subject to applicable law, you, not Remitly, are responsible for any amounts that are transferred to the incorrect person because you entered incorrect information related to the Recipient for a Transaction.\n\nSubject to limitations under applicable law, Remitly shall not be liable for a failure to complete Transactions in the following circumstances:\n\nyour payment instructions contain inaccurate instructions, mistakes, or insufficient information; or\n\nyour chosen Payment Instrument does not have sufficient funds to pay for a Transaction you initiate through the Service.\n\n7. PAYING FOR THE SERVICE\n\nOur Service Fee. In consideration for providing you with our Service, you agree to pay us a service fee (a \"Service Fee\") for each Transaction you submit, in addition to the Transaction Amount. Details on the discrete Service Fee amount related to a specific Transaction will be made available to you in our Mobile App or website before you give us your consent to execute your Transaction. Payment in US dollars is due and payable by you to us at the time the Transaction is submitted for processing. Service Fees may vary based on Recipient country and other factors and are subject to change.\n\nOther Charges. We are not responsible for fees that may be imposed by financial institutions associated with your Payment Instruments. For example, some credit card issuers may treat the use of your credit card to use the Service as a \"cash advance\" and may impose additional fees and interest costs for the transaction. Remitly is not responsible for any non-sufficient funds fees (“NSF Fees”), chargeback fees, or other, similar charges that might be imposed on you by your bank, credit card issuer, or other provider. If you submit a Transaction that results in Remitly being charged a fee or another amount because of your Payment Instrument not being used in an authorized manner, or with insufficient funds or credit, we will notify you of the fee we were charged, and you agree to pay us the equivalent amount.\n\nForeign Currency Exchange. We and our Service Providers (defined below) may make money when you pay for a Transaction in one currency and the Transaction is paid out in another currency because of the difference between the exchange rate at which we buy foreign currency and the exchange rate provided to you at the time of your Transaction. Exchange rates may vary based on Recipient country and other factors and are subject to change. If a foreign currency exchange rate applies to a Transaction that you request, it will be disclosed to you before you authorize the Transaction.\n\nThird-Party Fees and Charges. When you use our Service, other third parties may level fees, costs, or other liabilities against you. These third-parties may include your bank, card issuer, phone provider, or internet service provider. For example, your phone and/or internet service provider may charge you fees relating to data or messaging services. You (and not Remitly) are responsible for any fees, charges, costs, and/or expenses charged by such third parties in connection with your use of our Service. Please check your agreements with these third-party providers for details on any of these additional costs.\n\n8. RECEIVING A REMITTANCE\n\nService Providers. We work with local banks and other third-party outlets (each, a \"Service Provider\") to make funds available to Recipients. We try to provide current information on our website about the location, availability, and hours of our Service Providers. Please note that these may be subject to change without our knowing, and we are not responsible for any inaccurate or incomplete information that may be posted on the website.\n\nVerification of Recipients. Recipients may be required to provide information, such as a valid identification, to verify their identities to our Service Providers before receiving funds. Recipients may also be required to provide a reference number or another similar identifier associated with the applicable Transactions.\n\nExpired Transactions. We will cancel Transactions where funds are made available to Recipients by way of cash pick-up if the funds are not validly collected within 60 calendar days of when they were first made available. To the extent possible for these expired transactions, we will refund the full Transaction Amount, taxes, and any Service Fees that you paid as part of the Transaction. If we are unable to return the funds to this Payment Instrument after a legally required time has passed, the funds will be escheated to the applicable state.\n\n9. IMPORTANT SERVICE RESTRICTIONS\n\nOur Right to Limit Your Use of Our Service. In addition to the limitations described elsewhere in this Agreement, we may refuse to process any Transaction in our sole discretion where we have a reasonable belief or a reasonable basis to believe, that it is necessary to protect you and/or us or when it is otherwise required so that we may comply with legal or regulatory requirements. You agree that we may also limit the amount to be transferred, either on a per transaction or aggregated basis. These limits may be imposed on individual Remitly Accounts or specific Payment Instruments in your Remitly Account. We also reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue all or any part of the Service.\n\nDelays. We have the sole discretion to delay your Transaction, in accordance with applicable law, to verify your identity, validate your Payment Instrument, manage our financial risk, or if we believe that the Transaction may involve fraud or that a crime or violation of law, rule, or regulation has occurred, is occurring, or may occur. Depending on the reason for a delay or a failure to make the funds available to the Recipient, you may be entitled to a refund or other remedies in certain circumstances.\n\nTransfer Speed. Any transfer speed information or estimates for any of your Transactions that we provide to you on our website or in our Mobile App are estimates of the delivery date and time based on payment method, delivery method, transaction review, and system availability of Remitly, our partners and Service Providers. In addition to any transfer speed information and estimates we provide during the send process, before you submit a Transaction, and in your Transaction receipt, we will provide you with an exact date and time when you can expect your money to be delivered to your Recipient.\n\nCommercial Transactions. We are not responsible for the quality or delivery of goods or services for which you pay a Recipient by using the Service. You accept that using the Service to transfer funds for payments for goods and services is at your own risk.\n\nIneligibility. To comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may refuse Transactions from certain Senders and to certain Recipients that are included on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list, Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories list, and such other lists as issued by different government agencies.\n\nNo Changes. We generally do not let you change the details of your Transaction once it is submitted to us for processing. It is your responsibility to make sure your Transaction details are accurate. Pursuant to Section 6.5 and other Sections of this Agreement, you, and not Remitly, shall be responsible for any incorrect information or mistakes that you make when entering information about the Recipient for a Transaction. Nothing in this Agreement, however, shall be construed to limit your rights with respect to canceling Transactions or asserting an error with respect to a Transaction under applicable law.\n\nProhibited Activities.

Completion of your Transaction means that your recipient has picked up the funds you sent for cash pick-up or the funds have been deposited into the Recipient’s bank account at the time of your cancellation request. Upon receipt of a cancellation request, we will confirm whether the transaction has been completed, which may include communicating with our Service Providers to determine whether the transaction has been completed prior to initiating a refund. Remitly’s ability to stop or cancel a Transaction depends on the method you select to disburse the funds to your Recipient and the time when you submit your cancellation request.

During this period, You and Remitly agree that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled.

Failure to comply with the Claim Notice requirement is grounds for dismissal of any arbitration or small-claim action.\n\nAgreement to Arbitrate. YOU AND REMITLY AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM WILL BE RESOLVED BY INDIVIDUAL, BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU AND REMITLY THEREBY EACH AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND AGREE THAT YOU AND WE MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. The party pursuing arbitration will initiate such arbitration in JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider. Information regarding JAMS may be found on its website at https://www.jamsadr.com/. You and Remitly also agree that any dispute as to the applicability of this Section 19, the arbitrability of a Claim, or the scope or enforceability of this Section 19 will be decided by the arbitrator.\n\nThe rules governing any arbitration between You and Remitly will depend on the amount in controversy. For Claims between You and Remitly where the total value of all Claims (including attorneys’ fees to the extent provided under applicable law) exceeds $250,000, the arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures. A Copy of JAMS’ Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures is available at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.

However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow the terms as a court would. For the avoidance of doubt, the arbitrator can award public injunctive relief if authorized by law and warranted by the individual claim(s).\n\na. Mass Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that more than 75 consumers, represented by the same, related, or coordinate attorney or law firm, initiate arbitrations against Remitly which raise similar or related Claims, the Claims shall be administered as a mass arbitration under the JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines (Procedures).

Costs and Fees Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the applicable JAMS rules, subject to any state limitations on arbitration costs. If you prevail in arbitration you may be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Remitly will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Claim or the relief sought to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.\n\nf. Federal Arbitration Act. You and Remitly agree that this Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and therefore the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.) applies including its procedural provisions, in all respects.

To achieve this, our ethos is to do good with what we’re good at—tackling the challenges we are uniquely positioned to solve through our products, business practices, and in partnerships with our people and global communities.\n\nA few highlights across each of our impact priorities:\n\nFinancial Inclusion and Innovation In 2023, Remitly connected communities across borders by facilitating nearly $40 billion in transactions, at costs that are rapidly approaching— and in many cases achieving—the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal of 3%. Additionally, we are proud to offer our services in 17 languages, connecting customers to over 4.2 billion bank accounts, over 1.2 billion mobile wallets, and approximately 460,000 cash pick-up options worldwide.\n\nSecure and Ethical TransactionsWe’re committed to building trusted financial products that protect our customers and deliver secure and ethical transactions. In Q4 2023, over 95% of transactions on our platform required no customer support, and our total transaction losses (including fraud, chargebacks, and other disbursement losses) represented just 0.10% of our total 2023 send volume and just 0.15% in the previous year.\n\nCustomer-centric, Inclusive, and Diverse Global CultureAt Remitly, our global teams are united by a shared commitment to serving our customers.

We also continued to invest in the Remitly Scholars program, which enables Remitly employees to fund scholarships for students at two major universities in the Philippines. Since launching the program in 2015, we have provided scholarships amounting to more than $800,000 in total financial support.\n\nProtect People, Our Operations, and the PlanetWe are dedicated to protecting people, our operations, and the planet, and recognize that climate-related risks are increasing for the customers and communities we serve.

      "# [You’ve Been Scammed. Now What? Remitly’s Guide for Taking Back Control by Cassidy Rush on 2025-03-26](https://blog.remitly.com/money-transfer/what-to-do-after-being-scammed/)\nScams can happen to anyone. When they do, it’s normal to feel overwhelmed. But you’re not powerless—and you’re not alone. This guide walks you through what to do right away, how to protect yourself going forward, and where to turn for support.\n\nFirst Things First: Don’t Panic, But Do Act Fast\n\nThe sooner you respond, the better your chances of minimizing the damage or even getting some of your money back. Take a deep breath, then start with these steps.\n\nIf you’re still in touch with the scammer, stop all communication right away. Block their phone number, email address, and any other way they might try to reach you—social media, messaging apps, or anything else.\n\nIf they reach out again using a different number or account, ignore it. Don’t engage. Just block and move on. And if they ever ask to meet in person, contact local authorities immediately.\n\nSecure Your Accounts\n\nNext, update your passwords—especially for your email, bank accounts, and any apps that store sensitive info. Use unique passwords for each account, with a mix of upper and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters.\n\nIf you think your phone or computer might’ve been compromised, run a security scan using a trusted antivirus tool. It’s a good idea to keep your devices and apps updated with the latest security patches, too.\n\nReport What Happened\n\nReporting a scam might feel like an extra step when you’re already dealing with a stressful situation—but it matters. Your report could help stop the scammer from targeting someone else. It also creates a paper trail that might help with recovering your money or protecting your identity later.\n\nIn the U.S., you can report scams to:\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at ReportFraud.ftc.gov\n\nYour local police department, especially if the scam involved in-person contact or threats\n\nYour state attorney general’s office\n\nTry to Recover Lost Funds\n\nIf you sent money to a scammer, act quickly. Contact your bank or credit card provider and explain what happened—they might be able to freeze the transaction or reverse the charge.\n\nYou can also reach out to organizations like:\n\nThe FTC\n\nThe Department of Justice\n\nThe National Elder Fraud Hotline at 1-833-FRAUD-11\n\nThe Identity Theft Resource Center\n\nEven if recovery isn’t guaranteed, these groups can guide you on your next steps and help prevent future losses.\n\nKeep an Eye on Your Credit\n\nScammers often try to open credit cards or take out loans using stolen info. That’s why it’s smart to check your credit reports regularly. You’re entitled to one free report per year from each of the three major agencies—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—at AnnualCreditReport.com.\n\nIf you see anything suspicious, like accounts you didn’t open, flag it right away. You can also place a free fraud alert on your credit report to make it harder for anyone to open new accounts in your name.\n\nDon’t Forget to Take Care of Yourself\n\nBeing scammed can leave you feeling embarrassed, angry, or even ashamed. But you didn’t do anything wrong. Scammers are skilled at what they do, and they target people from all walks of life.\n\nIf you’re struggling emotionally, talk to someone you trust—a friend, a family member, or a counselor. You can also find support groups and victim assistance services that understand what you’re going through. Healing takes time, and reaching out for support is a powerful first step.\n\nMoving Forward: How to Protect Yourself From Future Scams\n\nOnce you’ve dealt with the immediate situation, it’s time to protect yourself from future risks. Here’s how to stay safe moving forward.\n\nStrengthen Your Digital Hygiene\n\nKeep your devices updated, use strong passwords, and enable two-factor authentication wherever possible. Be cautious with links or attachments in emails and messages—even if they look legit.\n\nWhen entering sensitive information online, make sure the site starts with “https://” and shows a padlock icon. That means your connection is secure.\n\nTurn on Alerts for Your Bank and Credit Accounts\n\nMost banks and credit card companies let you set up transaction alerts by text or email. These notifications can help you spot unauthorized activity quickly, giving you a better chance to take action before it gets worse.\n\nBe Careful What You Share Online\n\nScammers often use personal info they find on social media—like your birthday, hometown, or even your pet’s name—to guess passwords or answer security questions. Keep your privacy settings tight, and think twice before sharing personal details.\n\nTalk Openly with Friends and Family\n\nThe more we talk about scams, the harder it is for scammers to succeed. Share what you’ve learned with the people around you—especially older family members, who may be more vulnerable to certain kinds of fraud.\n\nRemind your loved ones that no legitimate company or government agency will ask for sensitive information by email, text, or over the phone.\n\nExplore Legal and Insurance Options\n\nIf you’ve lost a significant amount of money, check with your insurance provider to see if your policy covers fraud-related losses. And if you need legal advice, look for local legal aid groups or lawyers who specialize in consumer protection. They can help you understand your rights and next steps.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat should I do right after being scammed?\n\nStop communicating with the scammer. Secure your accounts and devices. Report the scam to the appropriate authorities. Then take steps to monitor your credit and protect your identity.\n\nHow can I report a scam in the U.S.?\n\nGo to ReportFraud.ftc.gov, contact your local police, and reach out to your state’s attorney general. Provide as much detail as possible.\n\nCan I get my money back after being scammed?\n\nIt depends on how the money was sent. Contact your bank or credit card provider right away. The faster you act, the better your chances.\n\nHow do I protect my identity after a scam?\n\nRequest a credit report from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Add a fraud alert to your credit file and watch for any suspicious activity.\n\nWho can I contact for emotional support?\n\nReach out to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor. You can also contact victim support services like the National Elder Fraud Hotline (1-833-FRAUD-11).\n\nHow do I spot a scam before it happens?\n\nWatch for red flags: pressure to act quickly, requests for personal info, or anything that sounds too good to be true. Always verify websites and messages before responding.",

As we look ahead to 2025 and beyond, I am excited about the growth opportunities and innovation that will enable us to deliver on our vision.”\n\nFourth Quarter 2024 Highlights and Key Operating Data\n\n(All comparisons relative to the fourth quarter of 2023)\n\nActive customers increased to 7.8 million, from 5.9 million, up 32%.\n\nSend volume increased to $15.4 billion, from $11.1 billion, up 39%.\n\nRevenue totaled $351.9 million, compared to $264.8 million, up 33%.\n\nNet loss was $5.7 million, compared to a net loss of $35.0 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $43.7 million, compared to $8.2 million, up 434%.\n\nFull Year 2024 Highlights and Key Operating Data:\n\n(All comparisons relative to the full year 2023)\n\nSend volume increased to $54.6 billion, from $39.5 billion, up 38%.\n\nRevenue totaled $1,264.0 million, compared to $944.3 million, up 34%.\n\nNet loss was $37.0 million, compared to a net loss of $117.8 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $134.8 million, compared to $44.5 million, up 203%.\n\n2025 Financial Outlook\n\nFor fiscal year 2025, Remitly currently expects:\n\nTotal revenue in the range of $1.565 billion to $1.580 billion, representing a growth rate of 24% to 25% year over year.\n\nGAAP net income to be positive for 2025 and for Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $180 million to $200 million.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2025, Remitly currently expects:\n\nTotal revenue in the range of $345 million to $348 million, representing a growth rate of 28% to 29% year over year.\n\nA GAAP net loss position for the first quarter of 2025 and for Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $36 million to $40 million.\n\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this earnings release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” We have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of forecasted Adjusted EBITDA to forecasted GAAP net income (loss) or to forecasted GAAP income (loss) before income taxes within this earnings release because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, calculate certain reconciling items with confidence due to the variability, complexity, and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from forecasted Adjusted EBITDA. These items include, but are not limited to, income taxes and stock-based compensation expense, which are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. The variability of these items could have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\nNote: All percentage changes described within this press release are calculated using amounts in the Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), for which revenue and active customers are presented in thousands and send volume is presented in millions. Rounding differences may occur when individually calculating percentages or totals from rounded amounts included within the press release body as compared to the amounts included within the Company’s SEC filings.\n\nWebcast Information\n\nRemitly will host a webcast at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, February 19, 2025 to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. The live webcast and investor presentation will be accessible on Remitly’s website at https://ir.remitly.com. A webcast replay will be available on our website at https://ir.remitly.com following the live event.\n\nWe have used, and intend to continue to use, the Investor Relations section of our website at https://ir.remitly.com as a means of disclosing material nonpublic information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nSome of the financial information and data contained in this earnings release, such as Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expenses, have not been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We regularly review our key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our performance, identify trends affecting our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information for management and investors in assessing our historical and future operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expenses are key output measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance, inform future operating plans, and make strategic long-term decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources. Remitly believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expenses provides additional tools to assess operational performance and trends in, and in comparing Remitly’s financial measures with, other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Remitly’s non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

      "# [Remitly, Payoneer cross-border payments climb by Lynne Marek on 2024-11-08](https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/remitly-payoneer-western-union-cross-border-payments/732400/)\nFor Remitly and Payoneer, cross-border payments volume and revenue soared during the third quarter, according to their earnings reports, but activity at their larger legacy rival Western Union was more tepid.\n\nRemitly, which caters to consumers seeking to send payments to people in other countries, reported third-quarter send volume jumped 42% over the year-earlier period to $14.5 billion, according to an earnings press release issued last week. That increase was the company’s highest in eight quarters as it logged a record number of new customers, Remitly Chief Financial Officer Vikas Mehta told analysts on an Oct. 30 webcast discussion of the results.\n\nThe activity pushed Seattle-based Remitly’s revenue up 39% over the year-ago quarter to $336.5 million, the company said. The company isn’t necessarily counting on the heightened use to continue in the fourth quarter, Mehta said.\n\nThe company experienced some “tailwinds, especially with the strength in the U.S. corridors,” Mehta said on the webcast. “While some of those tailwinds could continue, we thought it prudent not to include or bake them in into our Q4 outlook.”\n\nThe activity led to net income of $1.9 million for Remitly for the third-quarter, compared to a loss of $35.7 million for the year-earlier period, according to an earnings presentation.\n\nAt Payoneer, which targets its cross-border payments service at the business-to-business market, the company reported record quarterly volume as that third-quarter metric rose 25% to $20.4 billion, according to a Tuesday earnings press release.\n\nThat jacked up Payoneer’s quarterly revenue by 19% to $248.3 million, more than tripling net income to $41.6 million for the quarter.\n\nNew York-based Payoneer, which has been expanding by way of acquisitions, has increasingly sought to satisfy larger companies’ cross-border needs, as part of a revised strategy introduced by CEO John Caplan. Before Caplan took the top post last year, Payoneer had focused more on providing payment service to small and mid-sized businesses using e-commerce marketplaces.\n\n“On the heels of volatile results in 2023, year-to-date results have been more predictable, and we continue to believe the opportunities remain vast,” analysts at financial firm William Blair told their clients in a Tuesday note, referring to the Payoneer results.\n\nMeanwhile, Denver-based Western Union reported third-quarter revenue slid 6% to $1.04 billion as an income contribution from Iraq decreased compared to the year-earlier period, according to an Oct. 23 press release. Still, the company’s net income for the quarter increased 55% to $264.8 million as its expenses decreased and its provision for taxes swung significantly.\n\nAs the 171-year-old company seeks to increase the appeal of its newer digital payments options, it’s making some progress, with that offering charting an 8% increase in revenue for the quarter. Still, it only makes up a quarter of revenue from its main consumer money transfer segment, which shrunk during the quarter.\n\nThe company’s consumer money transfer business accounts for 90% of its revenue while ancillary consumer services provide another 10%, the release said.",
