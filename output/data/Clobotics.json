      "# [Blade Repairs – Clobotics](https://clobotics.com/resources/blade-repairs/)\nStructural Repairs\n\nClobotics are a trusted, ISO-certified partner for all categories of repair. With a range of in-house blade specialists, we can perform the most advanced repairs. Our blade experts assess the specific defects and choose relevant work instructions to ensure the highest quality of work.\n\nWhen we plan repairs, the optimal repair methods and access options are chosen. We choose access methods between rope access/act safe, cherry pickers, a wire suspended platform or bringing the blades to ground. Bringing blades to the ground to do repairs in a tent are naturally the last option due to cost and turbine downtime but can in some cases be the best option to ensure a high-quality result.\n\nWe use Clobotics Raven technologies to track our repair work. Raven optimizes the workflow of repair technicians and ensures that all repair steps are being captured automatically and produce accurate data for reporting and online access.\n\nMaterial Technology\n\nOver the last 12 years, our repair team has developed and designed materials and repair technologies to improve repair strength, weather limits and operational aspects. These materials and methods are widely used and the reason for Clobotics’ success in repairs. We are constantly developing new systems to improve our operations and competitiveness. We have a unique opportunity to develop in-house technologies because of our team of blade experts and engineers.\n\nWe have developed repair methods for carbon fibre based de-icing systems. The enhanced de-icing repair is considered more stable than the initial validation repair and the entire laminate transfers the heat. The system is proven in laboratories and has been applied on turbines since 2020.\n\nTo optimize repair speed, Clobotics has developed a ground-breaking ultraviolet (UV) curing resin. This method has been developed and tested in collaboration with the Danish Technology University. The result is a repair method that allows repair in –10°C temperatures and humidity up to 90%.\n\nSpare Parts Stock\n\nUptime of turbines is crucial and even the small parts can stop production. Therefore, we have a large and comprehensive stock of spare parts for a large range of blade types, including obsolete and hard to find spares.\n\nAt our warehouse in Denmark, we safely store mechanical parts and materials which are shipped to our field teams or clients directly. With our strong supplier network, we are always capable of sourcing spare parts and special materials.\n\nIn our warehouse facilities we repair and maintain parts and perform testing prior to installation.\n\nAnd as part of signing blade service agreements, we can maintain a client-dedicated safety stock ensuring a one-day response time.",

      "# [Online Portal – Clobotics](https://clobotics.com/resources/online-portal/)\nData Management\n\nData is collected throughout the lifespan of a wind turbine. This inspection data is a valuable source of information that is used for planning maintenance and repairs but also for evidence as part of a change in ownership and service responsibility.\n\nClobotics IRIS™ enables customers to generate a fast overview but also dig deep down to one specific defect. From there, the customer can append comments and recommendations to suppliers and other stakeholders.\n\nIRIS™ also supports upload of legacy data via structured image folders and a standard Excel file format for the metadata. And IRIS™ customers can set up accounts in the system to allow techs, engineers and other collaborators to access the data with flexible permissions based on their role.\n\nTo minimize our carbon footprint, our data centres have been chosen for their energy efficiency – all have a DCiE (Data Center Infrastructure Efficiency) of 83% or higher.\n\nChange to IRIS™ with ease\n\nWhen changing your data handling to IRIS™ you will be assisted with training and support from your local region. Clobotics operates globally and has the possibility to offer support in all time zones as needed.\n\nIRIS™ is an intuitive online portal where no apps or downloads are needed. You will be granted a username and password and you have instant access to all your data.\n\nClobotics IRIS™ has been engineered to upload various forms of drone and camera inspection data. If the information is consistent and in the most common formats, we can upload it and generate statistical overviews for use in planning. Data in special formats can be analyzed for the possibility of a custom upload.\n\nOur software engineers continuously improve our portal with the goal of being the preferred tool for managing blades, tower, and foundation inspections.\n\nRepair Tracking with Raven Technologies (EMEA only)\n\nRaven consists of hardware for collecting data and a software package for finalizing repair or inspection reports. After each day, the data is submitted to the Raven online portal where our blade specialist can oversee the quality of repairs and documentation. The data can also be accessed online by our clients that can closely follow the progress of our field work.\n\nRaven optimizes the workflow of repair technicians and ensures that all repair steps are being captured automatically. Raven produces accurate data for reporting and the results are presented online with easy access.\n\nBlade repairs are often expensive due to complicated logistics and working windows are often short because of weather conditions. Raven ensures full traceability for all environmental data, curing times and material batch numbers being used.",
      "# [Insights Announcement – Clobotics](https://clobotics.com/news/insights-announcement/)\nJanuary 21, 2022\n\nClobotics Wind Services announces the beta release of the Insights tab in our Clobotics IRIS™ portal for viewing, annotating, and collaborating around visual blade inspection results. Insights adds another, deeper level of analysis to help our customers get the most value from the visual blade inspection data collected by our Clobotics IBIS™ system. This initial release focuses on leading edge erosion, but other defect categories will follow over time.\n\nTraditionally, leading edge erosion is identified from visual blade inspections using the same polygon-based markup that is used for identifying all other blade defects. But erosion is not a discrete phenomenon, and Clobotics machine learning models are able to assess both the area and extent of erosion across the entire leading-edge surface of each turbine blade.\n\nThe results are presented in several ways:\n\nAn aggregate “Leading Edge Health” score that reflects the erosion health of the entire wind park.\n\nA by-turbine “Repair Priority” classification that goes from “Repair Immediately” to “Observation”\n\nA per turbine estimate of AEP loss as a percentage of maximum theoretical production\n\nA visual “heat map” of the extent and degree of the erosion super-imposed on the collected blade images\n\nInsights is exciting because it is a level of analysis that could not practically be accomplished by humans given the depth, extent and precision of image analysis required. It is enabled by the machine learning models that Clobotics has been refining since we first began analyzing visual inspection data nearly five years and over 45,000 wind turbines ago. Clobotics’ goal is a world where people do not have to quality control the results of these models anymore and both the cost and the turnaround time for inspection analysis is so trivial that it becomes a foundational part of how wind park owners manage their assets.\n\nThe reasons that this is a beta release are two-fold:\n\nWe are interested in feedback from our customers about both the metrics we are surfacing in Insights and how they can be further refined and integrated with the rest of the analysis in IRIS; and\n\nOur models are not quite to the level of accuracy that we want to see before calling the results shipping quality.",

      "# [Advanced Blade Inspections – Clobotics](https://clobotics.com/resources/advanced-blade-inspections/)\nInternal Blade Inspections\n\nInternal blade inspections are crucial for a detailed and thorough understanding of the condition of your wind turbine generators (WTGs). Clobotics performs internal blade inspections in a safe and effective way, providing blade specialists trained to work in confined spaces and experienced in using advanced robot crawler systems.\n\nClobotics offers internal blade inspections performed by blade specialists and a ROV (remotely operated vehicle). The blade specialist performs a thorough close-up inspection, while the ROV operator conducts a remote inspection of the blade tip, where humans are not allowed to enter.\n\nData from the inspection is uploaded to the Clobotics online portal when a data connection is available. This data is then made available for easy access and report generation.\n\nThe highly experienced Clobotics project management team facilitates the complete project management including task-specific planning that accounts for local requirements, confined space work, HSE, tools and procedures.\n\nLPS Testing\n\nLPS testing is an important part of yearly preventative maintenance routines to ensure flawless connectivity from the conductors all the way to the ground. Faulty conductors can have a significant impact on the structural integrity of the blade and, in worst cases, result in complete blade failure.\n\nClobotics performs tests according to OEM requirements, on the full blade structure and the remaining part of the Lightning Protection System.\n\nClobotics offers LPS testing performed by rope access or from cherry pickers during the process of performing repairs. A Digital Low Resistance Ohmmeter (the Megger testing unit) is used to capture resistance readings throughout the lightning conductor system. These readings are presented in a .pdf report which is available the following day. The results are compared to blade manufacturer specifications and for any reading that does not meet the requirements, repair suggestions will be provided.\n\nAll types of blades risk exposure to lightning strikes. Professional inspections and repairs are imperative to prevent further damage or blade failure.\n\nUptower Inspections\n\nFor further assessment of structural integrity, there might be cases where close-up inspections are needed. Uptower inspections can be performed from rope access, cherry pickers/boom cranes or wire-suspended platforms.\n\nClobotics has a range of cost-effective in-house systems to be able to react fast to inspection requests.\n\nBy choosing Clobotics you are certain that all specialists are well-educated and backed up by blade experts.\n\nUptower inspections can consist of visual inspections, tap testing or other NDT methods (non-destructive testing). Inspections are often combined with LPS testing to meet client needs or regulatory requirements.",
      "# [Autonomous Blade Inspections – Clobotics](https://clobotics.com/resources/autonomous-blade-inspections/)\nOnshore\n\nClobotics offers cost effective and flexible blade inspections using the autonomous Clobotics IBIS™ drone-based system.

      "# [Announcing Clobotics IBIS™ 4.8 – Clobotics](https://clobotics.com/news/ibis-4-8-release/)\nApril 11, 2024\n\nNew release improves speed, cost and quality of external visual blade inspections\n\nClobotics Wind Services is now shipping the latest version of its autonomous drone-based inspection system. The 4.8 release of Clobotics IBIS™ leverages the newly released Sony ILX-LR1 commercial camera, along with numerous mechanical and software improvements to deliver a state-of-the-art combination of speed, cost, and quality of data collected in wind turbine blade visual inspections.\n\n“Arthwind has deployed the Clobotics IBIS™ drone hardware in inspecting more than 10,000 wind turbines in the last two to three years. It is a robust system supporting us in the efficient delivery of solutions and insights to our clients. We are excited by the innovation and performance enhancement this new release offers,” says Armando Costa Rego, CEO of Arthwind Technologies.\n\nIt starts with the image\n\nThe most important piece of data collected in a visual blade inspection is the image and Clobotics constantly iterates its algorithms to improve the quality of images that IBIS™ obtains. That software gets a big boost in this release with the recently available Sony ILX-LR1 camera. Featuring a full frame sensor, sixty-one megapixels of resolution, faster shooting interval and focus adjust speed, better focus control accuracy and longer shutter life, the camera opens up major opportunities to capture substantially better images in the same or less time. Sony’s software development kit (SDK) allows Clobotics complete control over the camera’s capabilities enabling automatic, on-the-fly (literally) adjustments to lighting conditions, distance from the blade and speed of travel. The result is clearer, better lit images collected in the same or less time. And better images increase the chances that all defects on the blade surface will be found and correctly identified every time.\n\n“The newly designed body and functions of the ILX-LR1 meet the high image quality needs of industrial customers. Clobotics is a pioneer in using the high pixel performance of LR1 to take inspection image quality to a new level.” Said Nobuyoshi Shirai, the manager of Image Solution Marketing at Sony.\n\nBeyond the image, continuous improvement\n\nThe release also features mechanical and software improvements that are made possible by the combination of the new camera, continued improvements in DJI’s Matrice drone platform and Clobotics accumulated experience with this customized inspection system. New features and benefits include:\n\nFully automated one-button takeoff\n\nTurbines featuring blades up to 135 meters in length can be inspected in a single flight\n\nInspection time for a wind turbine with 60-meter blades has dropped by nearly 20% from 21 minutes to 17 minutes\n\nSystem lifecycle has been extended to approximately four times as many inspections as the previous version\n\n“From the beginning, our vision has been to build inspection systems powerful enough to collect the quality of images our customers need and our machine learning models require, but reliable enough and easy enough to use that our customers and partners can do the inspections themselves, saving time and money, said George Yan, CEO of Clobotics. The IBIS 4.8 release takes another big step towards that vision.”\n\nContact us to request more information about blade inspections using this new system.\n\nRecent Articles:",

This can not only save on costly repairs but also help to improve the overall performance and lifespan of the turbine.\n\nWind turbine blades are subject to erosion over time due to environmental factors such as wind, rain and temperature changes. If blade damage is not detected and repaired promptly, it can lead to major problems like blade failure, which can cause severe damage to the turbine and result in lengthy downtime for repairs.",

The store audits in Field Agent are good when they come around, but there's only one or two decent ones a week where I'm at.

For the past 4-5 years, the plugin team at [WP.org](http://WP.org) was reviewing plugins and making them remove trademarked words from their plugin names and slugs or forcing them to use them in a correct way. This did not include only the name 'Wordpress' but any trademarked name in tech. What they were saying was basically:\n\n\"WordPress Smileys\" -> Not ok name for a plugin\n\n\"Smileys for WordPress\" -> Ok, but still dont use WordPress, use WP. To start with a WP plugin having the word WP or WordPress in the name in the *WP* repo did not make sense anyway. Its not like you could install those plugins to some other software.\n\nThey also made people remove the entire word from their plugin names if the owner of that trademark was very litiguous. So this was not something related to only WordPress but a general change of situation across the open source ecosystem.\n\n#### Comment ID lpe2kgd with +3 score by [(throwawaySecret0432, Reddit, 2024-09-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lpe2kgd/) (in reply to ID low2rdh):\nIt was WORSE with WooCommerce.

That trademark is held by the WordPress Foundation. They reserve the non-profit use of the name “WordPress” for the Foundation, and the commercial use of the license is granted to Automattic. Using the “WordPress” trademark commercially requires getting approval from Automattic. Newfold Digital pays Automattic a licensing fee to use this trademark.\n\nThis post is about the WordPress Foundation additionally filing to trademark the phrase “managed WordPress.” If granted, then it would prevent companies from using the phrase “managed WordPress” when advertising their services unless they get permission from the WordPress foundation. Companies could still offer managed WordPress, but they would have to call it something else unless they get permission.\n\n## Comment ID loqyccr with +7 score by [(Rarst, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/loqyccr/) (in reply to ID 1fol35p):\nEhm... how would WPF possibly justify and protect trademarks related to hosting, since... it's not a hosting provider.\n\n### Comment ID lorfbf0 with +1 score by [(user_number_666, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lorfbf0/) (in reply to ID loqyccr):\nthank you!\n\n## Comment ID lorjoeg with +2 score by [(life3_01, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lorjoeg/) (in reply to ID 1fol35p):\nThis reminds me of the ClickFunnels debacle.

The fact that WP Engine and others have found commercially viable ways of using the software doesn’t mean that they can tighten down the use cases or restrict folks from using the license that was applied. \n\nThere are ways to get out of the GPL.

I have been around long enough to remember how this all played out.\n\nWhen the first commercial WordPress plugins came out, people lost their shit.  Everyone trying to make money on it was told you couldn't have Pro plugins and they needed to be free.  Thankfully Matt and others came to the rescue then and convinced the community this was allowed.  This was all 2008-2010 ish.\n\nThen people started taking those Pro plugins and reselling them as-is.  Wait a second, that's my hard work, how can they do that?  Once again, people said \"hey, it's GPL, we can do as I want\".  That's when everyone discovered the magic of trademarks.  Matt did a few presentations talking about that, and lots of Pro plugin and theme authors started acquiring the trademarks for their products.  It didn't stop someone from using your code, but it did stop them from using the name to market it.\n\nNow what appears to be happening is an overreach of using trademarks and shaming as a way to get competitors to disappear.  Basically it seems like a shakedown is starting to occur where anybody using the name WordPress, even in a product description, is in the crosshairs.  It seems that the 5% time hasn't been a huge success, so they are trying to forcibly extract it from companies under the pretense of paying an ongoing licensing fee to use WordPress as your product description, even though that's allowed under basically fair use.  \n\nMatt opened pandora's box with his keynote, but he doesn't seem to appreciate what he's done yet.  Almost every old time WordPress person I've talked to (some of which had top 5 plugins) are in agreement that he's basically pulling the temple down on his own head at this point.\n\n### Comment ID lot1k02 with +3 score by [(ikefalcon, Reddit, 2024-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lot1k02/) (in reply to ID lormn7q):\nThat, and if the trademarks are not enforced then they will be lost and using the trademark will be considered fair use.\n\n## Comment ID lorpspz with +2 score by [(azunaki, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lorpspz/) (in reply to ID 1fol35p):\nYikes\n\n## Comment ID loukyxp with +1 score by [(Oli_Picard, Reddit, 2024-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/loukyxp/) (in reply to ID 1fol35p):\nVery glad I decided to jump over to the JAM stack and build sites static now.

I try to follow similar steps with the app, test user, key, etc. but can't find it or get the right access.\n\nIs Meta trying to make it extra burdensome to embed Instagram feeds outside of their platform?

Poorly documented, regular bugs and outages, inconsistent errors.

You can also take screenshots of the profile and add them to your site.\n\nInstagram offers an API that allows you to display the feed on your website, but it requires some coding knowledge.For more information, visit: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-facebook-login. \n\nAnother option is to add a menu or submenu linking directly to your Instagram profile so visitors can view the content on Instagram. You can also add a button on your website that links to your Instagram profile.\n\nTo embed an Instagram post, go to the post, click the three dots in the top-right corner, and select \"Embed.\". Click the \"Copy embed code\" button and paste it into your website's admin panel on the desired page.\n\nFor an easier way to embed Instagram feeds, you can use tools like SociableKIT.",

When trying to download or install utilities or drivers, the download doesn’t complete and the installation does not proceed. \n\n**Here are the details of the problem:**\n\n**1. I check the utility or driver I want to install.**\n\n**2. I click \"Install\".**\n\n**3. A bar briefly appears saying \"Downloading\".**\n\n**4. After that, nothing else happens. The checkbox for the driver or utility I was trying to download becomes unchecked.**\n\n**5. If I run a scan, the utility or driver remains unchecked, indicating that it hasn’t been installed.**\n\n**6. To verify if it has at least been downloaded, I go to the file manager, and in the LiveUpdate folder within Documents, I find an empty .zip file, which confirms that the utility or driver hasn’t been downloaded correctly.**\n\nHas anyone else experienced similar issues with LiveUpdate this week? This would help me determine if the problem is with MSI's servers or something specific to my configuration, as my brother is experiencing the same issue, but it could be a mere coincidence.\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n## Comment ID lgh55pe with +1 score by [(shecho18, Reddit, 2024-08-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MSILaptops/comments/1ejj532/issues_with_liveupdate_in_msi_center_is_anyone/lgh55pe/) (in reply to ID 1ejj532):\nDownload drivers and utilities from your laptops official support site."

One of the most amazing things I found there was classifying SKUs in all kinds of photos where even it was hard for manual identification. With the cooperation work with different groups, the final results were really impressive. I was really glad to have the chance to do an intern there.\r\n1. Really really good mentorship!!!\r\n2. Challenging work of classification and a great sense of achievement after getting good accuracy.\r\n3. The office atmosphere is both relaxing and busy.

      "# [Clobotics Wind Services Announces Its New Clobotics Crawler™ Robot – Clobotics](https://clobotics.com/news/clobotics-wind-services-announces-its-new-clobotics-crawler-robot/)\nMay 2, 2024\n\nPurpose-built for visually inspecting the inside of wind turbine blades\n\nClobotics Wind Services announces availability of its Clobotics Crawler™ (code named KIWI) robot – a device purpose-built for safely, rapidly and cost-effectively documenting the internal condition of wind turbine blades. The device features two high resolution, high dynamic range (HDR) cameras, LED lighting, and a tethered line for retrieval. The robot weighs approximately six kilograms and has dimensions of 50cmx23cmx28cm.\n\nAddressing a trend\n\nDemand has been building among both manufacturers and owner/operators for inspections covering the inside of blades. Large stress cracks, bond line failures and some lightning damages are among the problems that are impossible to detect from the outside of the blade. By gathering and analyzing image data from both the inside of blades (through the Clobotics Crawler), and outside of blades (through the Clobotics IBIS™ drone inspection system), operations and maintenance managers can make better decisions about where to focus attention and allocate limited resources for further investigation and follow-up action using the Clobotics IRIS™ cloud data platform.\n\nAn end-to-end solution\n\nThe basic steps of an internal inspection using the Crawler include:\n\n1. Data collection from the site and upload to the cloud\n\n2. Labeling points of interest or defects seen in the images\n\n3. Analyzing statistical trends, generating reports, and developing action steps\n\nThe Clobotics Crawler addresses Step 1 with a focus on low cost, high quality and maximum safety. It connects securely to the Clobotics IRIS™ platform for Steps 2 and 3. Clobotics IRIS™ is a market leading cloud platform for hosting, labeling, and analyzing external visual blade inspections that addresses Steps 2 and 3 and has supported external visual inspections of over 100,000 wind turbines going back to 2017.\n\nSafety, Quality and Cost\n\nThe Clobotics Crawler’s design goal is to offer the best combination of safety, quality of data collected, and cost to inspect available in the marketplace. Safety is enhanced by creating a robot that can be positioned in the blade and conduct the inspection without requiring a technician to physically enter the blade. Quality is achieved by using industrial cameras configured to capture every surface with an innovative lighting approach and 26 megapixels of resolution. Quality also includes 100% image coverage of up to 2/3 of the blade length, as well as identifying the distance from the blade root of images and points of interest to within 20 centimeters of ground truth. Cost is a function of speed and ease of use. Using the Clobotics Crawler, a team of two technicians can expect to safely inspect two entire wind turbines in a single day.\n\n“In many ways, the hardest part of taking a data-driven approach to wind turbine operations and maintenance is collecting good data at an affordable cost. The Clobotics Crawler sets a new standard for high quality, automated, visual documentation of the inside of blades” said Yan Ke, Chief Technology Officer at Clobotics.",

      "# [Announcing Clobotics IBIS™ 4.8 – Clobotics](https://clobotics.com/news/ibis-4-8-release/)\nApril 11, 2024\n\nNew release improves speed, cost and quality of external visual blade inspections\n\nClobotics Wind Services is now shipping the latest version of its autonomous drone-based inspection system. The 4.8 release of Clobotics IBIS™ leverages the newly released Sony ILX-LR1 commercial camera, along with numerous mechanical and software improvements to deliver a state-of-the-art combination of speed, cost, and quality of data collected in wind turbine blade visual inspections.\n\n“Arthwind has deployed the Clobotics IBIS™ drone hardware in inspecting more than 10,000 wind turbines in the last two to three years. It is a robust system supporting us in the efficient delivery of solutions and insights to our clients. We are excited by the innovation and performance enhancement this new release offers,” says Armando Costa Rego, CEO of Arthwind Technologies.\n\nIt starts with the image\n\nThe most important piece of data collected in a visual blade inspection is the image and Clobotics constantly iterates its algorithms to improve the quality of images that IBIS™ obtains. That software gets a big boost in this release with the recently available Sony ILX-LR1 camera. Featuring a full frame sensor, sixty-one megapixels of resolution, faster shooting interval and focus adjust speed, better focus control accuracy and longer shutter life, the camera opens up major opportunities to capture substantially better images in the same or less time. Sony’s software development kit (SDK) allows Clobotics complete control over the camera’s capabilities enabling automatic, on-the-fly (literally) adjustments to lighting conditions, distance from the blade and speed of travel. The result is clearer, better lit images collected in the same or less time. And better images increase the chances that all defects on the blade surface will be found and correctly identified every time.\n\n“The newly designed body and functions of the ILX-LR1 meet the high image quality needs of industrial customers. Clobotics is a pioneer in using the high pixel performance of LR1 to take inspection image quality to a new level.” Said Nobuyoshi Shirai, the manager of Image Solution Marketing at Sony.\n\nBeyond the image, continuous improvement\n\nThe release also features mechanical and software improvements that are made possible by the combination of the new camera, continued improvements in DJI’s Matrice drone platform and Clobotics accumulated experience with this customized inspection system. New features and benefits include:\n\nFully automated one-button takeoff\n\nTurbines featuring blades up to 135 meters in length can be inspected in a single flight\n\nInspection time for a wind turbine with 60-meter blades has dropped by nearly 20% from 21 minutes to 17 minutes\n\nSystem lifecycle has been extended to approximately four times as many inspections as the previous version\n\n“From the beginning, our vision has been to build inspection systems powerful enough to collect the quality of images our customers need and our machine learning models require, but reliable enough and easy enough to use that our customers and partners can do the inspections themselves, saving time and money, said George Yan, CEO of Clobotics. The IBIS 4.8 release takes another big step towards that vision.”\n\nContact us to request more information about blade inspections using this new system.\n\nRecent Articles:",

      "# [How Clobotics Overcame Multi-Cloud and Massive File Storage Challenges by DASWU on 2024-09-13](https://dev.to/daswu/how-clobotics-overcame-multi-cloud-and-massive-file-storage-challenges-jp0)\nClobotics is a computer vision technology company with offices around the world. We apply computer vision and machine learning technologies to the wind power and retail industries. In the wind power sector, we use drones to inspect wind turbine blades, significantly reducing reliance on manual labor. In the retail industry, we analyze images of packaged products. In 2018, we were named to the CNBC Upstart 100 List.\n\nInitially, we used cloud SDKs for storage, and some systems employed internal wrappers. This resulted in a lack of a unified storage layer and challenges related to multi-cloud architectures, massive small files, and compatibility issues. When we transformed our storage layer, we compared HDFS, Ceph, SeaweedFS, GlusterFS, and JuiceFS. Finally, we chose JuiceFS.\n\nJuiceFS integrates with most major public cloud platforms and efficiently handles massive small files. Its full POSIX compatibility simplifies our data workflow, cutting engineering effort and costs. Currently, JuiceFS supports our wind power and retail operations, including application access, data annotation, and model training, with further expansion to new scenarios.\n\nIn this article, we’ll dive into our storage transformation journey, covering storage requirements, the selection process, how we applied JuiceFS, and our future plans.\n\nOur application architecture and storage requirements\n\nWe have two main application modules: wind power and retail. The figure below shows our technical architecture.\n\nAt the infrastructure layer, we use standardized service components, including the configuration center (such as Apollo), service governance center (such as Nacos), monitoring, logging, and alerting systems. These systems rely on widely recognized open-source components, such as Elasticsearch and Grafana for log and monitoring data visualization, and Prometheus for monitoring metric collection.\n\nAbove this, the common service layer focuses on centralized management of various asset data, covering multiple domains such as wind turbines in the wind power industry, stores and supermarkets in the retail industry, and our own assets like drones and retail cold storage units. In addition, the Identity and Access Management (IAM) system manages user permissions to ensure system security.\n\nTo address real-time, near-real-time, and batch processing needs during data handling, we designed and implemented a unified workflow and scheduling center. This center integrates open-source components like Apache Airflow for batch processing. We developed customized services to enhance scheduling capabilities for specific needs not fully covered by Airflow. We also abstracted AI model services to enable shared and reusable AI capabilities.\n\nData characteristics in computer vision scenarios\n\nOur core data types include various collected images, which differ significantly in specifications and pixel clarity. We add about 50 million raw images each month, covering both wind power and retail fields, with the following data characteristics:\n\nMassive small files: In the wind power scenario, raw image files can be up to tens of megabytes in size. Even after compression, their size remains substantial. During annotation, these images need to be examined individually. To enhance network transmission efficiency and annotation workflow, we used the tile image technique, which split large images into smaller tiles similar to map tiles. However, this method resulted in a significant increase in file numbers. Especially at the lowest tile levels, the files were small but numerous. In retail scenarios, we process about 2 to 3 million tile commands per month, with peaks exceeding 500.\n\nOver 20 types of model training: This includes both general and domain-specific models with different iteration cycles (weekly, monthly, quarterly) to meet different scenario needs. High metadata performance requirements: Metadata files such as CSV and JS are crucial for AI model training. Model files, as key components of online services, require frequent updates and iterations. This poses higher performance demands on storage.\n\nManagement of new data: With the continuous addition of new sites, regular updates or refreshes of these data are required. This generates extra I/O operations. Reports generated need to be temporarily stored in specific locations for user downloads or sharing.\n\nVersion management: This is critical, particularly for raw data and image datasets. In retail scenarios, rapid customer demand changes require detailed version control of datasets. In the wind power scenario, fine-grained management of data subsets and versions is also necessary for different blade shapes.\n\nStorage layer challenges in multi-cloud architectures\n\nWe use a multi-cloud storage solution, including Azure Blob Storage, Alibaba Cloud OSS, Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Amazon S3, and MinIO in standalone or small cluster modes. This is driven by the need to adapt to various customer environments.\n\nDue to different cloud service providers chosen by customers, we continuously performed adaptation work to support data access needs across various technology stacks (for example, .NET, Go, Python, C++, Java). This increased architectural complexity and operational challenges. In addition, due to functional and scenario differences between wind power and retail application platforms, we faced some degree of redundant development work. This put pressure on the startup's R&D resources.\n\nFurthermore, in a cross-cloud architecture, data annotation and model training operations required pulling data from multiple cloud storage services. This not only added complexity to data migration but also incurred potential costs due to frequent data reads. Therefore, optimizing cross-cloud data storage and access strategies while ensuring data consistency and security became a pressing issue.\n\nFile storage selection: POSIX, cloud-native, low maintenance\n\nGiven the data characteristics of our scenarios and the challenges of multi-cloud architecture, we reevaluated how to construct a more lightweight and flexible storage layer architecture. This architecture needs to handle different application scenarios' data storage requirements and enable rapid integration of new cloud storage services with minimal or no cost.\n\nIn the initial selection process, we carefully compared mainstream and open-source storage solutions, including HDFS, Ceph, SeaweedFS, GlusterFS, and JuiceFS. The table below shows the comparing results:\n\nAfter thorough research, we first ruled out HDFS, despite its widespread use in many companies. HDFS is designed for high-throughput big data scenarios rather than managing numerous files that need regular deletion. The NameNode in HDFS can experience significant pressure with a large number of files, and file deletion operations are costly. In addition, HDFS' lack of POSIX compatibility did not meet our requirements.\n\nGiven that most companies deploy and manage services on Kubernetes, the CSI Driver became a necessary consideration. Our data volume was only 700 TB and grew at a slow rate, so scalability was not our primary concern. However, controlling operational costs was critical. As a startup, we wanted to minimize human resources on infrastructure to focus on mission-critical areas.\n\nWhen evaluating Ceph, we found it easy to install and deploy, but it has these disadvantages:\n\nCeph has high operational costs, especially in capacity planning and expansion.\n\nAlthough Ceph’s documentation is extensive, it’s somewhat disorganized. This adds to the learning curve.\n\nSeaweedFS is a good open-source project, but it has these shortcomings:\n\nHigh operational costs\n\nIncomplete documentation\n\nGlusterFS has lightweight maintenance and scalability features. While building a self-managed storage layer with GlusterFS does incur some increase in operational costs, these costs are still within an acceptable range.\n\nUltimately, we chose JuiceFS. Its full POSIX compatibility and support for cloud-native environments caught our attention. JuiceFS has these advantages:\n\nIts low operational cost relies on its lightweight metadata engine such as MySQL or Redis, which was already part of our existing technology stack. This reduces operational complexity.\n\nJuiceFS’ clear and easy-to-understand documentation facilitates quick onboarding for newcomers.\n\nJuiceFS application and our benefits\n\nAfter we selected JuiceFS as our storage layer solution, our storage architecture has been progressively built and optimized. I’ll focus on key aspects of our practical application.\n\nIn the model training phase, the FUSE module plays a crucial role. Model training requires handling large amounts of data typically stored in the cloud. We use high-performance bare metals with sufficient GPU resources to meet computing and scheduling needs for model training. All training tasks are centralized on a single high-performance server. Thus, we use the FUSE mount method to synchronize data from various cloud storage sources to local directories, forming locally accessible storage. The largest single training dataset we handle reaches up to millions of entries, providing high data stability, primarily for rapid recognition model training in retail scenarios.\n\nIn resource management and access control, the CSI Driver application is mainly reflected in the use of mount Pods. This approach simplifies deployment and Pod organization. Through precise control by internal schedulers, it effectively avoids conflicts and concurrent read/write issues between different Pods. Although there were initial deadlock issues, we optimized dataset management and access scheduling strategies to achieve efficient concurrent control.\n\nJuiceFS S3 Gateway turned out to be an unexpected gain after we selected JuiceFS. Originally, we planned to build an independent file service for internal file sharing but faced complex permissions and timeliness issues. The S3 Gateway not only provided role-based access control to meet basic needs but also implemented fine-grained management of shared link validity through security tokens. This effectively prevents malicious data scraping risks.\n\nWe’ve gained the following benefits from using JuiceFS:\n\nA unified storage layer: JuiceFS achieved our primary goal of providing a unified storage layer. This layer not only simplified data storage management but also improved overall data access efficiency.\n\nFlexibility in cloud storage integration: As our application grows, we can more easily integrate new cloud storage services or types without requiring large-scale adjustments to our existing architecture. This enhanced the system's scalability and adaptability.\n\nSimplified access management: JuiceFS’ built-in access-control list (ACL) mechanism meets our access control needs in most scenarios. Although this functionality may require additional expansion for particularly large or complex application environments, it’s sufficient for our everyday requirements.\n\nCross-cloud storage version management: JuiceFS allows us to effectively manage data versions across different cloud storage services. This ensures data consistency and traceability, providing solid support for application decisions.\n\nPerformance monitoring and optimization: With JuiceFS, we can collect and analyze performance metrics of the storage layer. This enables us to more accurately assess and optimize system performance. This capability is difficult to achieve with raw cloud storage due to the typically opaque management of raw data.\n\nTransparent metadata management: JuiceFS makes it easier to access and manage file metadata, such as creation and modification times. This is crucial for advanced operations like data repair and tiered storage.\n\nPOSIX compatibility: JuiceFS’ POSIX compatibility means developers can use standard file APIs regardless of the programming language or technology stack. This eliminates the need for additional learning and enhances development efficiency and system compatibility.\n\nSimplified maintenance: Maintenance of JuiceFS is easy, primarily focusing on the health of metadata services like Redis or MySQL. This feature reduced maintenance complexity and minimized the risk of downtime due to improper system maintenance.\n\nCost savings: A surprising benefit of JuiceFS is the significant reduction in duplicate data uploads and storage. This improvement not only lowers storage costs but also saves operational expenses by reducing unnecessary data copies. In addition, cleaning up duplicate data further boosts storage efficiency.\n\nOur strategies for data storage and management optimization:\n\nAn independent instance architecture for data isolation and merging: We prioritize an independent instance architecture using different metadata engines to precisely manage various data storage needs. This approach reduces complexity and management challenges compared to building a unified large storage cluster. By allocating data to separate instances based on characteristics and usage, we facilitate quick access to specific data areas, like experimental data, and lower data recovery costs. Adding redundant nodes and retry mechanisms in model training helps quickly recover from issues, minimizing impact on training cycles.\n\nDataset version management and isolation:\n\nWe use multi-layer directory structures and specific naming conventions to manage data versions to address frequent updates in retail scenarios.\n\nUsing a unified prefix management system, we ensure quick location of specific dataset versions during model training or data retrieval.\n\nWe use a hierarchical directory structure with subnode arrangements to enable efficient management and rapid combination of different dataset versions. This enhanced our data processing flexibility and efficiency.\n\nOur future plans\n\nWe have these plans in the future:\n\nOptimize data warm-up process: Currently, we mount JuiceFS locally and copy data to the local directories used for model training. This method was considered inefficient in initial implementation. Given JuiceFS offers advanced features like caching and prefetching, we plan to explore and utilize these capabilities for smart data caching. This will improve dataset management and access speed.\n\nOptimize cross-regional data access: In certain scenarios, we need to access data located in Europe. But data protection policies restrict its transfer outside the region. While temporary access is allowed, we currently use an internally deployed CDN solution to manage this need to control costs and avoid potentially expensive native CDN services. In the future, we aim to use JuiceFS’ cache mechanism to facilitate short-term data sharing and efficient access, further optimizing cross-regional data handling.\n\nDeploy multiple JuiceFS instances: We’ll focus on detailed tuning and optimization. By adjusting configuration parameters, optimizing resource allocation, and monitoring performance, we aim to enhance overall system efficiency and stability. This will ensure JuiceFS can continue to effectively support our application needs.",

      "# [Counting The Costs Of Lightning Protection by Weather Guard on 2023-10-14](https://weatherguardwind.com/counting-the-cost-of-lightning-protection/)\nThis article on wind turbine lightning protection by Allen Hall, President, Weather Guard Lightning Tech, was originally published in PES Wind, Issue 2, 2023.]\n\nLightning strikes are powerful and awe-inspiring displays of nature’s fury. However, they can also wreak havoc on man-made structures, including wind turbines. According to industry experts, around 1 to 3 percent of lightning strikes to wind turbine blades result in blade damage. However, this figure can vary significantly, depending on the location of the wind farm, lightning strike characteristics, the type of turbine, and other factors. Let’s look at a few of the variables that contribute to the higher blade damage rates and how to address the unwelcome challenge.\n\nWhen we think about a generic lightning strike to a turbine, the simplest model becomes our baseline. A conveniently located cloud sits a few kilometers directly above our pending victim wind turbine. The charge in the cloud creates a lightning channel that wanders down towards Earth and eventually runs into one of the blades that happens to be in the 12 o’clock position. In this thought experiment, the blade’s lightning protection system receives the incoming lightning energy and directs it safely to the ground.\n\nIn reality, the geometry between a thunderstorm and a wind turbine can be wildly different than in our theoretical model.\n\nThe wind industry searches for the best wind resources whether they are offshore, near-shore, or onshore at a few thousand meters above sea-level. These locations can be much closer to lightning-prone clouds or naturally active convective storm areas, putting the turbines at greater risk.\n\nUpward strikes further complicate the turbine-to-cloud relationship. Strikes that originate from the wind turbine usually reach a cloud that is ill-prepared to surrender its charge. Why would this matter? Well, the lightning current from an upward strike can start and stop multiple times. Each time the lightning current stops for more than about 1/1000th of a second, a new lightning path to the blade is created, which gives lightning a second, third, or fourth opportunity to damage the blade.\n\nThe arrangement of turbines in a wind farm and the prevailing storm direction can greatly increase the likelihood of damage for individual turbines. While not a hard and fast rule, most storms globally travel west to east, and therefore turbines on the western edge of a farm will tend to take more strikes. On large farms, the turbines on the periphery will suffer the most lightning strikes. It is prudent to set aside a slightly larger repair budget for these turbines.\n\nThe desires of lightning are fairly basic. If a strike does not connect properly to the lightning protection system, due to the wrong lightning attachment, it will puncture the blade to reach the down conductor, carbon spar cap, or both. That means the damage hidden inside the blade can be considerably larger than a small hole on the exterior shell.\n\nA common question from operators in lightning prone regions is ‘If a turbine takes a lightning strike, should it be shut down until technicians can inspect it?’ Most lightning strikes do minimal to no damage, so shutting down turbines after every strike would result in unnecessary power production loss.\n\nA better approach is to use one of the several blade Continuous Monitoring System (CMS) products on the market, to detect lightning strikes and any subsequent blade damage. Australian-based Ping’s combined lightning detection and blade damage CMS system is an inexpensive option for lightning prone turbines. Another option would be the LASSIE system from Copenhagen-based Wind Power LAB. The LASSIE system utilizes data from a global network of lightning sensors, and it combines blade expertise with lightning risk control mechanisms to notify operators of strikes at the turbine level.\n\nWhat should happen once blade damage is discovered? There are conflicting approaches across the industry. Some operators with older turbines just let the turbine run until there is a safety issue. On newer turbines still under warranty, insurance claims and inspections are the norm. Either way, a proper investigation and strategy should be executed.\n\nWhat about the majority of turbines that are out of warranty, but need to operate another 10 to 15 years? The response depends on the category of damage, with Level 4 and 5 damage usually being repaired. What about Levels 1 to 3 damage? That’s where operators differ in approach with varying results.\n\nLarge operators and blade engineers who have a historic damage database and knowledge with a particular blade style can leverage their experience to decide on next steps. It’s the operators with a limited amount of data on a blade style that can struggle. Repairing a blade shell is relatively simple, but evaluating a damaged spar cap, or shear-web bond line, is a larger problem that generally requires outside experts. A repair made in due time may cost as little as €10k, whereas if the damage is left to propagate, €50-100k can come quickly. Worse, a catastrophic blade failure that could’ve been avoided.\n\nThe independent blade consultants at Wind Power LAB have created a simple series of steps to evaluate and put damaged blades back into service. The first step is to photograph the external surfaces of the blade with high resolution cameras. Drone companies such as Thread, Nearthlab, Clobotics, ZeitView, and SkySpecs are common drone inspection choices that produce quality images which are available on cloud-based platforms.\n\nThe second step is internal blade inspections. Most structural lightning damage occurs on the inside of a blade, where bond lines and composite shear web or box beam structures carry the massive blade loads. Internal inspections are critical to preventing catastrophic failures due to internal damage from lightning.\n\nAs Morten Handberg, Chief Blade Specialist at Wind Power LAB, points out, the internal inspections can be complicated, as damaged internal structure is not always near the puncture location. Once lightning punctures a blade shell, the lightning will travel several meters along traces of dirt, moisture, or oil in its search for a down conductor or carbon structure. That makes internal damage areas even more difficult to predict because lightning paths are random.\n\nInternal blade inspection instruments and methodologies are readily available today from companies such as Wind Power LAB, Aerones, Arthwind, and Clobotics. They produce high quality images/videos with accurate location information that can quickly deduce structural issues. The robots and drones are designed to travel far up the blade in narrow spaces that technicians are unable to reach. No confined space entry, increased data coverage, operational efficiency, and lower technician needs are all advantages of the new approach for internal blade inspections. The key is to get clear video or images of the spar caps, spar webs, bond lines, and down conductor.\n\nThird, measure the resistance of the lightning protection system (LPS). This simple check will identify issues such as a broken or degraded down conductor that may have caused internal structural damage to the blade. Lightning currents flowing through a broken down conductor can generate over 10,000°C of heat, which breaks down epoxy and can render the area structurally compromised.\n\nBlades with carbon fiber spar caps or other structural members introduce an additional level of complexity to the investigations. Carbon fiber is sufficiently conductive to carry large amounts of lightning energy. Some blade manufacturers integrate the carbon structure as part of the LPS system, while others keep the carbon structure intentionally isolated from the LPS. Each design approach has advantages, but both are susceptible to lightning damage under certain conditions.\n\nRecent industry focus has been on the isolated carbon fiber spar cap design because lightning can create high voltages that force flashovers between a spar cap and the down conductor. These flashovers tend to occur near the hub and towards the blade tip.\n\nLightning flashover events are not common, but Joel Saxum, Wind Power LAB’s Vice President of North American Sales, recommends analysis and guidance from experienced blade engineers. On-site inspections provide back-office engineers with better insights to understand complex issues such as previous damage and repairs.\n\nHaving a blade-specific engineer investigate damages is particularly useful for blades that have experienced multiple strikes. When this is the case, there may be more complex matters at hand, involving LPS system issues, possible retrofits needed, and/or refurbishment campaigns that can all strive to resolve lightning issues.\n\nAs global warming increases the frequency of lightning strikes around the world, detecting, inspecting, and repairing damage early will be key to extending blade lifetimes and a cleaner future. With drone and visual inspection data, blade engineers can make better informed decisions about lightning damage that ultimately reduce the cost impacts on operations.\n\n# #\n\nFor reprints of this article, or to discuss better blade protection, contact us.\n\nClick here to read The Electrifying Dance of Upward Lightning, another exclusive article by Allen Hall.\n\nImage credit: Tom A.

      "# [Weathernews further enhances SeaNavigator platform on 2024-07-14](https://www.windsystemsmag.com/weathernews-further-enhances-seanavigator-platform/)\nIn line with its focus on continuous improvement of its cloud-based SeaNavigator voyage-optimization solution, Weathernews Inc recently launched two new integrated AI tools — the Berth Waiting Forecast for vessel operators and New Tonnage Finder for charterers — at a recent customer networking event in Copenhagen.\n\nLeveraging AI predictive data for enhanced voyage efficiency and emissions reduction, the Berth Waiting Forecast enables customers to address the challenge of port delays resulting from adverse weather disrupting cargo handling. Providing real-time ship status and congestion forecasts up to one week ahead, the tool integrates AIS data from 70,000-plus ships, weather data, as well as historical delay comparisons and trends to support users in optimizing voyage plans and adjust speed, thereby reducing fuel burn and CO2 emissions.\n\nWaiting time is identified by analyzing vessels clustered within Weathernews’ predefined port boundaries, and calculated from average weekly values over the preceding month. The map zoom function provides a detailed visualization of vessels in the area. The tool also provides historical reference (the count of vessels in the past month) along with a forecast of vessels that will likely be on standby in the target area in the following week — by day and time of the day.\n\nForecasts are estimated based on historical waiting trends, past weather observations and future weather forecasts. Designed specifically for charterers to improve revenue by identifying best-performing vessels using real-time data and advanced ship-performance models, the tool leverages AIS data combined with global weather and hydrographic data and ship-performance models. The calculation methodology uses four key parameters: good weather average speed; good weather current factor; good weather performance speed; and good weather fuel consumption. Average speed from AIS data is extracted from set periods in which conditions comply with the good weather definition, and combined with direction and speed corresponding to the current AIS position.\n\nThe current factor is then calculated based on the relative direction of the vessel’s heading and current direction. This is subtracted from the average speed to give the vessel’s performance speed, while an Al model estimates fuel consumption based on individual vessel characteristics and its calculated average speed. “Meanwhile, operational risks due to more extreme weather events will require enhanced risk profile, advanced and revised modelling and real-time notification procedures to act proactively rather than reactively – in order to secure lives and assets,” West concluded.\n\n“These two new tools further enhance SeaNavigator where every competitive advantage counts, not only in terms of minimizing logistics risk but also operational costs and environmental impact,” said Niels Christian Kjærgaard, director EU Business Development at Weathernews. “They enhance the already impressive predictive capabilities of the platform, which including the Voyage Planner and CII Simulator represents an end-to-end solution that covers all customer scenarios.”\n\nWeathernews Inc. was founded in 1986 as a service provider supporting safe maritime operations for shipping companies and is today a global leader in weather intelligence, forecasting, route optimization, emission monitoring, performance monitoring, and more. It employs about 1,100 industry professionals and dedicated staff members, all united by the company’s vision to protect, care for, and use the latest technology for its customers worldwide. In addition to a global network of offices, Weathernews also operates two private satellites and several advanced weather radars around the globe.",
