      "# [Blade Repairs – Clobotics](https://clobotics.com/resources/blade-repairs/)\nStructural Repairs\n\nClobotics are a trusted, ISO-certified partner for all categories of repair. With a range of in-house blade specialists, we can perform the most advanced repairs. Our blade experts assess the specific defects and choose relevant work instructions to ensure the highest quality of work.\n\nWhen we plan repairs, the optimal repair methods and access options are chosen. We choose access methods between rope access/act safe, cherry pickers, a wire suspended platform or bringing the blades to ground. Bringing blades to the ground to do repairs in a tent are naturally the last option due to cost and turbine downtime but can in some cases be the best option to ensure a high-quality result.\n\nWe use Clobotics Raven technologies to track our repair work. Raven optimizes the workflow of repair technicians and ensures that all repair steps are being captured automatically and produce accurate data for reporting and online access.\n\nMaterial Technology\n\nOver the last 12 years, our repair team has developed and designed materials and repair technologies to improve repair strength, weather limits and operational aspects. These materials and methods are widely used and the reason for Clobotics’ success in repairs. We are constantly developing new systems to improve our operations and competitiveness. We have a unique opportunity to develop in-house technologies because of our team of blade experts and engineers.\n\nWe have developed repair methods for carbon fibre based de-icing systems. The enhanced de-icing repair is considered more stable than the initial validation repair and the entire laminate transfers the heat. The system is proven in laboratories and has been applied on turbines since 2020.\n\nTo optimize repair speed, Clobotics has developed a ground-breaking ultraviolet (UV) curing resin. This method has been developed and tested in collaboration with the Danish Technology University. The result is a repair method that allows repair in –10°C temperatures and humidity up to 90%.\n\nSpare Parts Stock\n\nUptime of turbines is crucial and even the small parts can stop production. Therefore, we have a large and comprehensive stock of spare parts for a large range of blade types, including obsolete and hard to find spares.\n\nAt our warehouse in Denmark, we safely store mechanical parts and materials which are shipped to our field teams or clients directly. With our strong supplier network, we are always capable of sourcing spare parts and special materials.\n\nIn our warehouse facilities we repair and maintain parts and perform testing prior to installation.\n\nAnd as part of signing blade service agreements, we can maintain a client-dedicated safety stock ensuring a one-day response time.",

      "# [Insights Announcement – Clobotics](https://clobotics.com/news/insights-announcement/)\nJanuary 21, 2022\n\nClobotics Wind Services announces the beta release of the Insights tab in our Clobotics IRIS™ portal for viewing, annotating, and collaborating around visual blade inspection results. Insights adds another, deeper level of analysis to help our customers get the most value from the visual blade inspection data collected by our Clobotics IBIS™ system. This initial release focuses on leading edge erosion, but other defect categories will follow over time.\n\nTraditionally, leading edge erosion is identified from visual blade inspections using the same polygon-based markup that is used for identifying all other blade defects. But erosion is not a discrete phenomenon, and Clobotics machine learning models are able to assess both the area and extent of erosion across the entire leading-edge surface of each turbine blade.\n\nThe results are presented in several ways:\n\nAn aggregate “Leading Edge Health” score that reflects the erosion health of the entire wind park.\n\nA by-turbine “Repair Priority” classification that goes from “Repair Immediately” to “Observation”\n\nA per turbine estimate of AEP loss as a percentage of maximum theoretical production\n\nA visual “heat map” of the extent and degree of the erosion super-imposed on the collected blade images\n\nInsights is exciting because it is a level of analysis that could not practically be accomplished by humans given the depth, extent and precision of image analysis required. It is enabled by the machine learning models that Clobotics has been refining since we first began analyzing visual inspection data nearly five years and over 45,000 wind turbines ago. Clobotics’ goal is a world where people do not have to quality control the results of these models anymore and both the cost and the turnaround time for inspection analysis is so trivial that it becomes a foundational part of how wind park owners manage their assets.\n\nThe reasons that this is a beta release are two-fold:\n\nWe are interested in feedback from our customers about both the metrics we are surfacing in Insights and how they can be further refined and integrated with the rest of the analysis in IRIS; and\n\nOur models are not quite to the level of accuracy that we want to see before calling the results shipping quality.",
      "# [Blade Optimization – Clobotics](https://clobotics.com/resources/blade-optimization/)\nAerodynamic optimization using Vortex Generators\n\nVGs (Vortex Generators) are a commonly known technology that can increase power production by 2-4%. Over the years, leading edge erosion and dirt can result in gradually decreasing energy production, but by adding VG’s the airflow along the blade surface is energized which improves the aerodynamics and, in turn, the energy production of the turbine.\n\nClobotics delivers the entire scope of this service. Blades are 3D modelled and analysis is performed based on individual blade type and size.\n\nWe also have in-house specialists who can successfully apply vortex generators as part of repair projects or LEP application projects.\n\nMaterial Development\n\nWe are continuously working on material technologies and improvements of work methods using our decades of operational experience. As a market leading technology company, we lead the development of materials for faster application and for improving the performance of turbines. Development projects are initiated by Clobotics internally but pursued in cooperation with leading specialists in the wind industry.\n\nDuring our repair work, we capture all relevant data using our Clobotics Raven technologies so our blade experts can closely follow material behaviour in the application phase and material deterioration in the years following application. Raven ensures that all environmental data, cycle times and paint intervals are accurately logged.\n\nMaterials are tested in our facilities in Denmark in collaboration with accredited testing firms. As an operational repair company, we sign early adoption agreements with operators for testing materials and their duration on live turbines in the early stage of development. This ensures an extremely fast development cycle where products are rapidly perfected for mainstream operations.",

      "# [Advanced Blade Inspections – Clobotics](https://clobotics.com/resources/advanced-blade-inspections/)\nInternal Blade Inspections\n\nInternal blade inspections are crucial for a detailed and thorough understanding of the condition of your wind turbine generators (WTGs). Clobotics performs internal blade inspections in a safe and effective way, providing blade specialists trained to work in confined spaces and experienced in using advanced robot crawler systems.\n\nClobotics offers internal blade inspections performed by blade specialists and a ROV (remotely operated vehicle). The blade specialist performs a thorough close-up inspection, while the ROV operator conducts a remote inspection of the blade tip, where humans are not allowed to enter.\n\nData from the inspection is uploaded to the Clobotics online portal when a data connection is available. This data is then made available for easy access and report generation.\n\nThe highly experienced Clobotics project management team facilitates the complete project management including task-specific planning that accounts for local requirements, confined space work, HSE, tools and procedures.\n\nLPS Testing\n\nLPS testing is an important part of yearly preventative maintenance routines to ensure flawless connectivity from the conductors all the way to the ground. Faulty conductors can have a significant impact on the structural integrity of the blade and, in worst cases, result in complete blade failure.\n\nClobotics performs tests according to OEM requirements, on the full blade structure and the remaining part of the Lightning Protection System.\n\nClobotics offers LPS testing performed by rope access or from cherry pickers during the process of performing repairs. A Digital Low Resistance Ohmmeter (the Megger testing unit) is used to capture resistance readings throughout the lightning conductor system. These readings are presented in a .pdf report which is available the following day. The results are compared to blade manufacturer specifications and for any reading that does not meet the requirements, repair suggestions will be provided.\n\nAll types of blades risk exposure to lightning strikes. Professional inspections and repairs are imperative to prevent further damage or blade failure.\n\nUptower Inspections\n\nFor further assessment of structural integrity, there might be cases where close-up inspections are needed. Uptower inspections can be performed from rope access, cherry pickers/boom cranes or wire-suspended platforms.\n\nClobotics has a range of cost-effective in-house systems to be able to react fast to inspection requests.\n\nBy choosing Clobotics you are certain that all specialists are well-educated and backed up by blade experts.\n\nUptower inspections can consist of visual inspections, tap testing or other NDT methods (non-destructive testing). Inspections are often combined with LPS testing to meet client needs or regulatory requirements.",
      "# [Autonomous Blade Inspections – Clobotics](https://clobotics.com/resources/autonomous-blade-inspections/)\nOnshore\n\nClobotics offers cost effective and flexible blade inspections using the autonomous Clobotics IBIS™ drone-based system. We deliver inspections in a safe and efficient manner. The innovative IBIS™ system ensures scalability for large volume campaigns as it inspects all turbine brands and types without any advanced setup or human intervention.\n\nOur global presence as well as our Drone as a Service offering enable potential savings in mobilization and labour costs, allowing customers to reach the best possible combination of cost and quality for their visual inspections.\n\nAfter the inspection, the results are shared in our intuitive online portal where users can view results and generate customized reports. The portal access can be shared with stakeholders for planning and transparency in repair campaign execution.\n\nOffshore\n\nWith our 10-year track record in offshore inspections, companies often choose us to perform their offshore blade inspections. We customize each project according to local settings, Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) regulations, weather forecast and asset brand/type.\n\nWe perform inspections from the client’s own vessels or charter suitable vessels for each project where drones are launched directly from the vessel deck. Vessels are chosen to optimize environmental impact (fuel consumption) and the overall project. By choosing the right vessels we ensure a high success rate and extremely low inspection time.\n\nDrone inspections directly from the vessel mean extremely high cycle time and a safer operation as no technician has to transfer to the turbine.\n\nClobotics IBIS™ is one of the fastest and most efficient drone systems on the market and is therefore the optimal solution for offshore turbines where downtime and asset utilization are extremely important.\n\nInsource your Inspections\n\nRemote locations and unpredictable weather demand flexibility when accomplishing wind turbine blade inspections. Clobotics’ Drone as a Service (DaaS) offering delivers by enabling your personnel to accomplish the job using our push button IBIS™ drone technology. Gain flexibility and avoid the travel, CO2 emissions and weather downtime expenses associated with mobilizing contracted inspectors.\n\nContinued development of our Clobotics IBIS™ drone technology has led us to a new milestone. We are now able to train your personnel to inspect wind turbine blades with the press of a button, offering an unprecedented level of autonomy and flexibility to your blade inspection jobs.\n\nClobotics has developed a training program which can be tailored for technicians with different skill sets. The comprehensive training course takes two days and covers all that is needed for a licensed drone operator to perform inspections confidently, safely, and efficiently.\n\nBecome a Partner\n\nAs a Clobotics DaaS partner, your organization will have access to the most advanced technology ensuring a competitive advantage in competing for inspection business. DaaS partners will continue to receive the latest innovations backed up by a Clobotics office in their region.\n\nYour technician will perform inspections and upload data.

      "# [Announcing Clobotics IBIS™ 4.8 – Clobotics](https://clobotics.com/news/ibis-4-8-release/)\nApril 11, 2024\n\nNew release improves speed, cost and quality of external visual blade inspections\n\nClobotics Wind Services is now shipping the latest version of its autonomous drone-based inspection system. The 4.8 release of Clobotics IBIS™ leverages the newly released Sony ILX-LR1 commercial camera, along with numerous mechanical and software improvements to deliver a state-of-the-art combination of speed, cost, and quality of data collected in wind turbine blade visual inspections.\n\n“Arthwind has deployed the Clobotics IBIS™ drone hardware in inspecting more than 10,000 wind turbines in the last two to three years. It is a robust system supporting us in the efficient delivery of solutions and insights to our clients. We are excited by the innovation and performance enhancement this new release offers,” says Armando Costa Rego, CEO of Arthwind Technologies.\n\nIt starts with the image\n\nThe most important piece of data collected in a visual blade inspection is the image and Clobotics constantly iterates its algorithms to improve the quality of images that IBIS™ obtains. That software gets a big boost in this release with the recently available Sony ILX-LR1 camera. Featuring a full frame sensor, sixty-one megapixels of resolution, faster shooting interval and focus adjust speed, better focus control accuracy and longer shutter life, the camera opens up major opportunities to capture substantially better images in the same or less time. Sony’s software development kit (SDK) allows Clobotics complete control over the camera’s capabilities enabling automatic, on-the-fly (literally) adjustments to lighting conditions, distance from the blade and speed of travel. The result is clearer, better lit images collected in the same or less time. And better images increase the chances that all defects on the blade surface will be found and correctly identified every time.\n\n“The newly designed body and functions of the ILX-LR1 meet the high image quality needs of industrial customers. Clobotics is a pioneer in using the high pixel performance of LR1 to take inspection image quality to a new level.” Said Nobuyoshi Shirai, the manager of Image Solution Marketing at Sony.\n\nBeyond the image, continuous improvement\n\nThe release also features mechanical and software improvements that are made possible by the combination of the new camera, continued improvements in DJI’s Matrice drone platform and Clobotics accumulated experience with this customized inspection system. New features and benefits include:\n\nFully automated one-button takeoff\n\nTurbines featuring blades up to 135 meters in length can be inspected in a single flight\n\nInspection time for a wind turbine with 60-meter blades has dropped by nearly 20% from 21 minutes to 17 minutes\n\nSystem lifecycle has been extended to approximately four times as many inspections as the previous version\n\n“From the beginning, our vision has been to build inspection systems powerful enough to collect the quality of images our customers need and our machine learning models require, but reliable enough and easy enough to use that our customers and partners can do the inspections themselves, saving time and money, said George Yan, CEO of Clobotics. The IBIS 4.8 release takes another big step towards that vision.”\n\nContact us to request more information about blade inspections using this new system.\n\nRecent Articles:"

Which are frustrating, but not deal breakers., 4 stars [(ddrdddddwerf rxdswaddf., Apple App Store, 2024-07-02)](https://apple/11450262026)\nI downloaded and use this app through Clickworker, the app is required to complete their “Jobs” US Store visits.(which is the main reason I use their platform).\n \n\n1) DATA: The amount of storage and data needed for this app is CRAZY. It uses more data than all of my other apps combined! Which I really don’t understand if all of our photos are being uploaded to their cloud.\n\n2) REVISTS: This happened to me both times I was requested to complete a revisit, both times due to missing an aisle in a specific category. So, I get to the store capture the required photos for the category that needed revision, and click upload. I immediately receive an error message stating to complete the remaining categories. Which you can’t even access the in app camera for those other categories. Only the categories that need revision had the little blue circle icon with the camera on it, that you need to click to open the camera. Needless to say I was frustrated because I did the required work but was unable to upload. Also, if we are asked to leave a store before we finish all the categories, I think it’s only fair to be compensated for the work we could complete. \n          >So, maybe instead of an error message, it could be a pop up message asking something like “You have uncompleted categories! Would you still like to submit your photos?”.  Just an idea\n\n3) I use both my iPhone 13 and my Samsung Galaxy S21+ do complete these “Jobs”. Id much rather the Samsung due to the camera being zoomed out more. I timed it I completed a Job 3X faster on the Samsung. The Samsung captures more of the aisle in one shot. I seen another person have this same issue with iPhone. \n(when an aisle is over a 100 shots I usually just click the option to add more photos to that category, and continue a little bit further back than when I stopped. That way I  my stop and start spot overlaps, as to not miss any products. When there is more than one aisle I usual finish the first then upload, go back to the main screen, click on the category again that way it’s a fresh category. When I go back to my main screen in my list of categories, I’ll see the category twice.\n           > It would be nice if there was a way I could access the zoom settings for the in app camera. That way I could adjust the zoom in or out, as needed.\n\nAlso, maybe an in app chat feature would be helpful for some. In case they get stuck or just have a general question. Other than that the app works as intended and is pretty much self explanatory.",

Which are frustrating, but not deal breakers., 4 stars [(ddrdddddwerf rxdswaddf., Apple App Store, 2024-07-02)](https://apple/11450262026)\nI downloaded and use this app through Clickworker, the app is required to complete their “Jobs” US Store visits.(which is the main reason I use their platform).\n \n\n1) DATA: The amount of storage and data needed for this app is CRAZY. It uses more data than all of my other apps combined! Which I really don’t understand if all of our photos are being uploaded to their cloud.\n\n2) REVISTS: This happened to me both times I was requested to complete a revisit, both times due to missing an aisle in a specific category. So, I get to the store capture the required photos for the category that needed revision, and click upload. I immediately receive an error message stating to complete the remaining categories. Which you can’t even access the in app camera for those other categories. Only the categories that need revision had the little blue circle icon with the camera on it, that you need to click to open the camera. Needless to say I was frustrated because I did the required work but was unable to upload. Also, if we are asked to leave a store before we finish all the categories, I think it’s only fair to be compensated for the work we could complete. \n          >So, maybe instead of an error message, it could be a pop up message asking something like “You have uncompleted categories! Would you still like to submit your photos?”.  Just an idea\n\n3) I use both my iPhone 13 and my Samsung Galaxy S21+ do complete these “Jobs”. Id much rather the Samsung due to the camera being zoomed out more. I timed it I completed a Job 3X faster on the Samsung. The Samsung captures more of the aisle in one shot. I seen another person have this same issue with iPhone. \n(when an aisle is over a 100 shots I usually just click the option to add more photos to that category, and continue a little bit further back than when I stopped. That way I  my stop and start spot overlaps, as to not miss any products. When there is more than one aisle I usual finish the first then upload, go back to the main screen, click on the category again that way it’s a fresh category. When I go back to my main screen in my list of categories, I’ll see the category twice.\n           > It would be nice if there was a way I could access the zoom settings for the in app camera. That way I could adjust the zoom in or out, as needed.\n\nAlso, maybe an in app chat feature would be helpful for some. In case they get stuck or just have a general question.

I try to follow similar steps with the app, test user, key, etc. but can't find it or get the right access.\n\nIs Meta trying to make it extra burdensome to embed Instagram feeds outside of their platform?

You can also take screenshots of the profile and add them to your site.\n\nInstagram offers an API that allows you to display the feed on your website, but it requires some coding knowledge.For more information, visit: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-facebook-login. \n\nAnother option is to add a menu or submenu linking directly to your Instagram profile so visitors can view the content on Instagram. You can also add a button on your website that links to your Instagram profile.\n\nTo embed an Instagram post, go to the post, click the three dots in the top-right corner, and select \"Embed.\".

For the past 4-5 years, the plugin team at [WP.org](http://WP.org) was reviewing plugins and making them remove trademarked words from their plugin names and slugs or forcing them to use them in a correct way. This did not include only the name 'Wordpress' but any trademarked name in tech. What they were saying was basically:\n\n\"WordPress Smileys\" -> Not ok name for a plugin\n\n\"Smileys for WordPress\" -> Ok, but still dont use WordPress, use WP. To start with a WP plugin having the word WP or WordPress in the name in the *WP* repo did not make sense anyway. Its not like you could install those plugins to some other software.\n\nThey also made people remove the entire word from their plugin names if the owner of that trademark was very litiguous.

That trademark is held by the WordPress Foundation. They reserve the non-profit use of the name “WordPress” for the Foundation, and the commercial use of the license is granted to Automattic. Using the “WordPress” trademark commercially requires getting approval from Automattic. Newfold Digital pays Automattic a licensing fee to use this trademark.\n\nThis post is about the WordPress Foundation additionally filing to trademark the phrase “managed WordPress.” If granted, then it would prevent companies from using the phrase “managed WordPress” when advertising their services unless they get permission from the WordPress foundation.

I have been around long enough to remember how this all played out.\n\nWhen the first commercial WordPress plugins came out, people lost their shit.  Everyone trying to make money on it was told you couldn't have Pro plugins and they needed to be free.  Thankfully Matt and others came to the rescue then and convinced the community this was allowed.  This was all 2008-2010 ish.\n\nThen people started taking those Pro plugins and reselling them as-is.  Wait a second, that's my hard work, how can they do that?  Once again, people said \"hey, it's GPL, we can do as I want\".  That's when everyone discovered the magic of trademarks.  Matt did a few presentations talking about that, and lots of Pro plugin and theme authors started acquiring the trademarks for their products.  It didn't stop someone from using your code, but it did stop them from using the name to market it.\n\nNow what appears to be happening is an overreach of using trademarks and shaming as a way to get competitors to disappear.  Basically it seems like a shakedown is starting to occur where anybody using the name WordPress, even in a product description, is in the crosshairs.  It seems that the 5% time hasn't been a huge success, so they are trying to forcibly extract it from companies under the pretense of paying an ongoing licensing fee to use WordPress as your product description, even though that's allowed under basically fair use.  \n\nMatt opened pandora's box with his keynote, but he doesn't seem to appreciate what he's done yet.  Almost every old time WordPress person I've talked to (some of which had top 5 plugins) are in agreement that he's basically pulling the temple down on his own head at this point.\n\n### Comment ID lot1k02 with +3 score by [(ikefalcon, Reddit, 2024-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lot1k02/) (in reply to ID lormn7q):\nThat, and if the trademarks are not enforced then they will be lost and using the trademark will be considered fair use.\n\n## Comment ID lorpspz with +2 score by [(azunaki, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lorpspz/) (in reply to ID 1fol35p):\nYikes\n\n## Comment ID loukyxp with +1 score by [(Oli_Picard, Reddit, 2024-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/loukyxp/) (in reply to ID 1fol35p):\nVery glad I decided to jump over to the JAM stack and build sites static now.

So ours was companyname.workday@companyname.com.\n\n\nUsing our own custom smtp allowed two additional items besides the name.  1 we were able to get bounce back emails.  2 in case any custom notifications didn’t have a reply to email address, the replies would still come to us.",
      "# Post ID 1ff8i5o: Google's New Verification System Could End Your Business with +16 score by [(Hour_Touch6006, Reddit, 2024-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePlayDeveloper/comments/1ff8i5o/googles_new_verification_system_could_end_your/)\nHey r/GooglePlayDeveloper\n\nI'm reaching out to share a highly stressful experience and seek any advice from those who might have faced similar issues. Google has implemented a system where any discrepancies in your business information, like a company address change via Dun & Bradstreet (D&B), can trigger an immediate risk of having your developer profile and apps removed from Google Play. Here's what happened:\n\nAfter updating my company address with D&B—a process that's cumbersome on its own—it took about 12 days before a red warning banner appeared on my Google Play Console, stating, \"Your developer profile and all apps will be removed from Google Play on October 8, 2024.\" Panic-inducing, to say the least, especially since the exact issue wasn't clear until I dug into the notifications inbox.\n\nThe problem stemmed from my address update with D&B not being reflected correctly in Google's records. Clicking on \"Review Updates\" took me to a page with \"Action Required\" badges next to my company name and address, but no further options to resolve the issue myself. The only available action was to contact support—a frustrating dead end given Google support's reputation for slow responses.\n\nI promptly filled out the support form, but days have passed with no reply, and the deadline is looming. This process is not only unfriendly but seems almost designed to penalize developers for factors beyond their control.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? How did you manage to get Google's attention and resolve your issue before such drastic measures were taken? Any advice would be incredibly appreciated.\n\n## Comment ID lmt7lzn with +6 score by [(mrelmalo, Reddit, 2024-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePlayDeveloper/comments/1ff8i5o/googles_new_verification_system_could_end_your/lmt7lzn/) (in reply to ID 1ff8i5o):\nYes I have a client that has the same issue. They have sent in all kinds of goverment documents proving the new address. Yet Google keeps saying it's invalid. They have done everything Google asked for, no dice.\nIt's just automated systems and no human support. \nHonestly at this point they are just thinking of creating a completely new account.\n\nGoogle's support is horrible and it's just getting worse every day.\nI know it wasn't the answer you where looking for. But you're not alone. Unfortunately.\n\n### Comment ID lmt8ast with +3 score by [(Hour_Touch6006, Reddit, 2024-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePlayDeveloper/comments/1ff8i5o/googles_new_verification_system_could_end_your/lmt8ast/) (in reply to ID lmt7lzn):\nThanks for the response. It's really frustrating. Would creating a new account work? I haven't explored that possibility but at this point I'm willing to do anything to protect my business. Would it be possible to transfer the app to the new account, or would we have to recreate the app under a new name, bundle id, etc?\n\n#### Comment ID lmta904 with +3 score by [(mrelmalo, Reddit, 2024-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePlayDeveloper/comments/1ff8i5o/googles_new_verification_system_could_end_your/lmta904/) (in reply to ID lmt8ast):\nTo be honest, it's anyone's guess. But one this is for certain, that procedure is probably be a big hassle too dealing with Google.\nThey haven't actually gone through with it. I can update with a reply if they do and how it turns out. \n\nIt's amazing how little they care. It's really the result of being too big and having no competition. \nApple uses to have a reputation for being a stickler, but Google has the recent years gone above board to being the bigger douchebag. The biggest ever in fact.\n\n## Comment ID lmw4jo4 with +4 score by [(NoPhilosopher7739, Reddit, 2024-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePlayDeveloper/comments/1ff8i5o/googles_new_verification_system_could_end_your/lmw4jo4/) (in reply to ID 1ff8i5o):\nNot this exactly, but Google and their handling of Play Store policies is getting out of hand IMO.\n\n## Comment ID lmtjg0s with +3 score by [(NLL-APPS, Reddit, 2024-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePlayDeveloper/comments/1ff8i5o/googles_new_verification_system_could_end_your/lmtjg0s/) (in reply to ID 1ff8i5o):\nOnce your details updated at D&B (around after 5 days) you needed to fill this form [https://support.google.com/googlepay/contact/change_name_address](https://support.google.com/googlepay/contact/change_name_address)\n\n### Comment ID lmtjtnq with +1 score by [(Hour_Touch6006, Reddit, 2024-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePlayDeveloper/comments/1ff8i5o/googles_new_verification_system_could_end_your/lmtjtnq/) (in reply to ID lmtjg0s):\nYep I already did that.

I have been hounding them too, but I will keep at it. I am planning to comment on every thread mentioning this issue, and will post new threads every day until they finally pay attention to me. I hate being the annoying person that does stuff like that, but I feel like it's the only way I can avoid absolute catastrophe.\n\nThis whole process is SO broken, and I just can't get over how Google is handling the whole thing.

That model was set up to even support someone who would have one item, perhaps a rare item, to post on eBay and not have be a business.  Also I recently looked up California's rules on sole proprietors and they are very liberal.  They take into account the casual business practices of artists and musicians.  What I know is as long as you report your taxable income these agencies are happy.\n\nThe problem is exacerbated by foreign governments whose politicians are either jealous of people who can work for themselves or clueless about economics the impact of the rules they pass.

It uses more data than all of my other apps combined! Which I really don’t understand if all of our photos are being uploaded to their cloud.\n\n2) REVISTS: This happened to me both times I was requested to complete a revisit, both times due to missing an aisle in a specific category. So, I get to the store capture the required photos for the category that needed revision, and click upload. I immediately receive an error message stating to complete the remaining categories. Which you can’t even access the in app camera for those other categories. Only the categories that need revision had the little blue circle icon with the camera on it, that you need to click to open the camera. Needless to say I was frustrated because I did the required work but was unable to upload. Also, if we are asked to leave a store before we finish all the categories, I think it’s only fair to be compensated for the work we could complete. \n          >So, maybe instead of an error message, it could be a pop up message asking something like “You have uncompleted categories! Would you still like to submit your photos?”.  Just an idea\n\n3) I use both my iPhone 13 and my Samsung Galaxy S21+ do complete these “Jobs”. Id much rather the Samsung due to the camera being zoomed out more. I timed it I completed a Job 3X faster on the Samsung. The Samsung captures more of the aisle in one shot. I seen another person have this same issue with iPhone. \n(when an aisle is over a 100 shots I usually just click the option to add more photos to that category, and continue a little bit further back than when I stopped. That way I  my stop and start spot overlaps, as to not miss any products. When there is more than one aisle I usual finish the first then upload, go back to the main screen, click on the category again that way it’s a fresh category. When I go back to my main screen in my list of categories, I’ll see the category twice.\n           > It would be nice if there was a way I could access the zoom settings for the in app camera. That way I could adjust the zoom in or out, as needed.\n\nAlso, maybe an in app chat feature would be helpful for some. In case they get stuck or just have a general question. Other than that the app works as intended and is pretty much self explanatory.",

My job there could be divided into three parts -- developing SKU classification algorithms, analyzing current error types and learning Azure Machine Learning Services for our model training. One of the most amazing things I found there was classifying SKUs in all kinds of photos where even it was hard for manual identification. With the cooperation work with different groups, the final results were really impressive. I was really glad to have the chance to do an intern there.\r\n1. Really really good mentorship!!!\r\n2. Challenging work of classification and a great sense of achievement after getting good accuracy.\r\n3. The office atmosphere is both relaxing and busy. During the lunch break, everyone was relaxed and talked about different interesting things. In work time, everyone was working hard.",

      "# [Revolutionizing wind turbine blade inspections with drones by Baltic Wind on 2024-06-13](https://balticwind.eu/revolutionizing-wind-turbine-blade-inspections-with-drones/)\nIn a recent LinkedIn post, RWE CEO Sven Utermöhlen highlighted the transformative impact of drones on blade inspections in their offshore fleet. Previously requiring up to three experts to abseil from the nacelle to the blades, this task is now performed by a remote-controlled drone, offering significant advantages.\n\nDrones have increased the safety of blade inspections, eliminating the need for dangerous abseiling procedures. They provide comprehensive imagery of the entire blade surface, making inspections faster and reducing turbine downtime. Inspecting all three blades on a turbine now takes less than 30 minutes.\n\nSupported by the Horizon platform from Skyspecs, RWE’s engineering experts classify and evaluate the findings. Their catalog includes over 600 different configurations, classified by the material affected, damage severity, and repair urgency. This data helps spot trends and patterns, such as damage development speed and material fragility, aiding in optimal repair timing.\n\nDetailed information from drone inspections provides a holistic view of wind farm conditions, enabling strategic planning for blade repairs. Knowing precise repair needs beforehand is crucial, especially given the small weather windows suitable for repairs. Utermöhlen praised the Operations and Maintenance team and highlighted successful collaborations with Clobotics Wind Services.\n\nClobotics’ New Drone Release\n\nIn April, Clobotics Wind Services launched a new version of its autonomous drone-based inspection system. The 4.8 release of Clobotics IBIS™ features the new Sony ILX-LR1 commercial camera, offering enhanced speed, cost-efficiency, and image quality. The new camera provides clearer, better-lit images, improving defect identification.\n\nThe latest release includes mechanical and software enhancements, leveraging DJI’s Matrice drone platform and Clobotics’ experience. Features include fully automated one-button takeoff and inspection capabilities for turbines with blades up to 135 meters. Inspection times have decreased by nearly 20%, and the system’s lifecycle has been extended.\n\nGeorge Yan, CEO of Clobotics, emphasized their vision to create powerful, reliable, and easy-to-use inspection systems.

      "# [Inspecting Inside and Out for Blade Hazards by Rogers Weed on 2024-05-15](https://www.nacleanenergy.com/wind/inspecting-inside-and-out-for-blade-hazards)\nImage data from visual inspections is nearly always the starting point for planning a blade maintenance campaign. Historically, external visual inspections of the outside of the blades have been the dominant dataset because they are less expensive to collect; no one needs to climb the tower to gather images of the blades. Ground-based cameras were initially employed, which then gave way to drones and automation that increased both the quality of images and the efficiency of collecting those images.\n\nRecently, however, we have seen a significant increase in requests for internal blade inspections, despite the extra cost involved in collection. Why the recent increase? What types of problems does each inspection type detect? How should customers think about using them in managing their fleet?\n\nInternal inspections come in more shapes and sizes because the process already involves sending people up the tower. Some are done entirely manually by having the technician crawl into the blade with a flashlight and a camera. Others involve using manually operated robots (including drones) to assist in data collection. Internal inspections often go beyond visually documenting the inside of the blade, and include tasks like checking the lightning protection system cables and doing tapping or other non-destructive testing on suspicious spots inside the blade.\n\nWhat problems is each process useful for detecting? Erosion of the leading edge is an easy one, as this problem starts from the outside of the blade and works its way in; an external visual inspection is the obvious choice for identifying these problems. Similarly, lightning strikes generally happen near the tip of the blade where getting an internal view can be nearly impossible. Since the outside of the blade features receptors that can be visually inspected for damage, an external visual inspection is generally the first tool for detecting lightning strikes (a test of the lightning protection system, or LPS, is another valuable diagnostic). Laminate cracks, however, are a crossover problem. While they can be spotted from either an external inspection or an internal one, cracks on the inside can often be detected sooner since the surfaces are not painted, and early laminate stress can be seen in the form of whitish areas.\n\nInternal inspections are where most structural problems will be best assessed. Large stress cracks will show up in the laminate and can corroborate things seen from the outside. Bond line failures around the sheer webs and spar caps, as well as any problems with the root structure (connecting root bolts, etc.) are identified through an internal inspection. The LPS down conductor cable is also accessible from inside the blade, and sometimes there is obvious visual damage related to lightning flash overs from the laminate.\n\nA few final observations before moving to suggestions on using these tools: Most of the structural problems detected from the inside will require expensive repairs, so the earlier they are detected, the better. Problems like laminate cracks are usually visible from the inside before they can be seen on the outside. External inspections can be enhanced using thermal sensing to reveal problems in bond lines, but managing the heat source is tricky so reliable results can be tough to produce.\n\nHow, then, to decide on using these tools? Cost is certainly a major factor – internal inspections can be five times more expensive per wind turbine than external inspections. If the assets are approaching the end of their warranty period, an external inspection can be a cost-effective way to document their condition at transfer. If the blade models on site are known to have structural problems, internal inspections will be much better at detecting those and, as mentioned before, the earlier those are detected the better. If previous external inspections have revealed cracks in the exterior of the blades, those should all be further investigated via internal inspections. Collecting accurate distance-to-the-root information will allow an internal inspection to provide further insight into suspicious cracks seen from the outside.\n\nAt the end of the day, what’s most important is adopting a data-driven approach to getting the most from a finite blade maintenance budget. High-quality data consistently collected is the cornerstone of this approach. For visual inspections, image resolution, lighting, and focus, and accurate measurements of defect size and location from the root of the blade can be the difference between a maintenance campaign that accomplishes its objectives on time and budget, and one that rapidly falls behind when repair teams discover something unexpected when they arrive to do their work.\n\nRogers Weed is a Managing Director for the Clobotics Wind Services Americas Region.

      "# [The AI Sector in China. Much Smaller Than the US, Similar in Size to the UK. — Glass.AI by Sergi Martorell on 2023-09-06](https://www.glass.ai/glass-news/mapping-the-ai-sector-in-china-much-smaller-than-the-us-and-similar-in-size-to-thenbspuk)\nIntroduction\n\nThe UK is preparing to host the first global AI summit, but it’s unclear if China will attend or be invited. This is partly due to the fact that there is an AI arms race going on between the West (especially the United States) and China, and we are only in the early stages.\n\nThere are many ways to measure this technological race and the size of the respective AI sectors. Leading publications have provided some data, for example, a Nikkei study argued that China is far surpassing the U.S. in both quantity and quality of AI-related papers, with Tencent, Alibaba and Huawei among the top 10 companies producing AI research. China also seems to lead in AI patent filings, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and several papers.\n\nThat said, the United States leads in terms of investment, and we know that US firms invested billions into the Chinese AI sector (before restrictions were imposed). Below is some data published by Bloomberg recently:\n\nThe US also kickstarted the Generative AI revolution, a fundamental technological shift. The success of ChatGPT accelerated the ongoing race for AI supremacy not only among the tech giants but also between countries. China recently published new rules for generative AI, becoming one of the first countries in the world to regulate this new technology.\n\nIt’s an open race that will continue over the coming years across many dimensions. Some argue that China will win because of its talent, growing technological skill and innovation, and national investment in science and technology. Others point out that while China has caught up with impressive speed, the conditions that allowed it to do so will likely also prevent it from taking a meaningful lead in the AI race.\n\nUnfortunately in this debate, there is limited data about the AI sector in China beyond the tech giants and the data on academic publications and patents. In this article, we aim to contribute to the debate by providing data and evidence about the companies in the AI sector in China. We have previously researched hundreds of emerging technology sectors globally, including the AI sectors of the United States and the United Kingdom. It wasn’t easy to replicate this for China but we’ve built techniques that have allowed us to crawl the Chinese ‘open’ web. Here is what we found.\n\nMethodology\n\nglass.ai is an AI research capability that reads the web to discover, understand and track the activities of companies. Since 2022, we’ve been tracking companies on a global scale, including companies in China that have a web presence and content in Standard Chinese, the modern standardized form of Mandarin Chinese.\n\nTo identify the AI companies in China and gather details about their products and services, we used our capability to crawl the Chinese web, that is, millions of company websites, news sources, social media, sector-specific sites and other sources. Our AI read content in Chinese and also gathered any evidence that appeared in English. For reference, below are the main sources our AI reads to discover and track companies globally:\n\nHow did we determine if the companies are based in China?\n\nWe have an ongoing discovery process that reads websites across different country domains and classifies the sites as company websites if it detects certain criteria around content (e.g. active, in Chinese/English, business content) and if possible, will predict the sector and geography of the business (e.g. an address in China). This, combined with any addresses mentioned on social sites and news sources, gives us extra validation about the location of the companies. The AI can also gather evidence on foreign AI companies with significant presence/activity in a particular country. This is how we mapped a large part of the Chinese economy based on its web presence and then identified the AI companies. In this particular piece, we focused on AI companies that are headquartered in China.\n\nHow did we identify Chinese AI companies?\n\nAt the start of the research, we used a list of 100+ semantically related AI categories, topics/keywords, phrases and other criteria that define the boundaries of the AI sector. At glass.ai, we have completed various research projects that have mapped the AI sectors of different countries. As a result, we already have a well-defined taxonomy that has been used in recent studies to discover companies that focus on AI. For the research on China, we didn’t want to reinvent the wheel, therefore we applied the same taxonomy to identify Chinese AI firms. The long list of AI topics/phrases was translated from English to Chinese.\n\nBelow are the main high-level categories:\n\nOur next step involved deep-reading a total of 6m+ Chinese company websites to identify any text that suggested the companies develop AI products or services. To ensure more complete coverage, we augmented the results with other data sources like news, social media, and sector-specific sources. We also leveraged previous studies and papers that have looked into the AI ecosystem to train and fine-tune our language models.\n\nSize of the AI Sector in China\n\nOur research capability was able to identify a total of 3,373 AI companies in China across sectors, AI categories and geographies. This includes both private and public-listed companies. It’s important to caveat that the Chinese ‘public web’ is less open than in other countries. This comes with some challenges but we are confident that our results are a good proxy of the size of the Chinese AI sector.\n\nThe crawler picked up the top tech companies in China (Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba, ByteDance, Huawei, JD.com and Xiaomi) as they are actively applying AI technologies, and some have launched large language models (LLMs) recently. It also identified the top AI companies in China like Mobvoi, Rokid, Megvii, CloudWalk, SenseTime, Hikvision and others. But more importantly, it managed to uncover several thousand Chinese AI companies that have never been mentioned in any previous research. We provide some examples further below.\n\nAt a high level, the results showed that a clear majority of companies use generic terms and phrases like Artificial Intelligence or AI to describe their core activities (3,637). It’s worth noting that many companies fall into more than one high-level category.\n\nThe analysis also confirmed that China has many AI companies in the Computer Vision and Image Processing category (783). This includes companies that specialize in facial recognition, machine vision, image processing, image recognition and other sub-categories.\n\nComputer Vision was followed closely by Intelligent Robotics (728) and the Machine Learning (368) and Deep Learning (278) categories, with a combined total of 646 companies. There were 164 firms focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP), 129 in Data Mining and 59 companies in the Generative AI category. The rest of the companies were in Speech Recognition (37), Autonomous Vehicles (26) and Machine Translation (25). It’s worth noting that there were another 200+ companies that fell into multiple smaller categories.\n\nWe also did some semantic clustering of the various descriptions to get a more granular view of the activities of the companies, highlighting how some of the core technologies are being applied. For example, deep learning in healthcare and drug discovery, machine vision for security, quality control, and monitoring systems, and big data in smart cities, logistics and IoT platforms. It also highlights the application of AI technology in traditional areas such as advertising, finance and fraud detection.",

This method of inspection can be dangerous for the personnel involved, and the resulting downtime can be expensive. Wind turbine inspection can be performed using autonomous drones to achieve lower downtime, cost, and health risks. To enable autonomy, the field of drone path planning can be assisted by this research, namely machine learning that detects wind turbines present in aerial RGB images taken by the drone before performing the maneuvering for turbine inspection. For this task, the effectiveness of two deep learning architectures is evaluated in this paper both without and with a proposed fuzzy contrast enhancement (FCE) image preprocessing algorithm. Efforts are focused on two convolutional neural network (CNN) variants: VGG19 and Xception. A more traditional approach involving support vector machines (SVM) is also included to contrast a machine learning approach with our deep learning networks. The authors created a novel dataset of 4500 RGB images of size 210 × 210 to train and evaluate the performance of these networks on wind turbine detection. The dataset is captured in an environment mimicking that of a wind turbine farm, and consists of two classes of images: with and without a small-scale wind turbine (12V Primus Air Max) assembled at Utah Valley University. The images were used to describe in detail the analysis and implementation of the VGG19, Xception, and SVM algorithms using different optimization, model training, and hyperparameter tuning technologies. The performances of these three algorithms are compared in depth alongside those augmented using the proposed FCE image preprocessing technique.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nIn recent years, the demand for renewable energy generated from wind power has increased rapidly. The year 2021 reflects this as wind’s second-best year of growth despite pandemic conditions disrupting the industry and introducing supply chain problems [1].\n\nWind turbines used to harness wind power can be damaged and degraded by their environments [2,3,4,5]. When the blades of wind turbines fail, the effects can be disruptive by leading to a long-term shutdown of operations. Wind turbine blades were found to cause over 5% of wind turbine failures in a study that surveyed more than 1500 wind turbines for fifteen years [6]. These failures can result in wind turbine downtime over ten days [7]. Continuous condition monitoring of wind turbines can remediate such issues before a wind turbine failure occurs.\n\nTraditionally, rope teams manually inspect wind turbines for possible damages such as cracks on the blades [8]. This includes certified professionals from organizations such as the Industrial Rope Access Trade Association (IRATA) and the Society of Professional Rope Access Technicians (SPRAT) [9,10]. However, conditions surrounding wind turbines could be dangerous to personnel, providing hurdles for wind energy maintenance, and potentially increasing the cost. Additionally, in-person inspection requires turbine shutdown, resulting in higher downtime. Consequently, alternative methods of inspecting wind turbines are of great interest: the market is quickly turning towards unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and drones for inspecting wind turbines [8,11]. Organizations such as Clobotics and Arthwind are pioneering work in this field [12,13]. Similar interest is seen in academia [14,15,16,17]. One issue that still needs to be solved with the adoption of drone inspection is presenting the data acquired from drones in a way that is understandable to the engineers performing maintenance [11]. To mitigate this problem, a system needs to be developed to allow the drones to act autonomously and preferably respond with a single output indicating whether a wind turbine requires maintenance or not.\n\nAn initial key aspect of this type of autonomous drone inspection is its ability to accurately identify the presence of wind turbines in the field. Machine learning has been proven to be a powerful tool for classifying objects in images [18]. A classical approach to machine learning involves the use of support vector machines (SVMs). Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are also extensions of the branch of machine learning known as neural networks (NNs), and are particularly adept at classifying images, making them instrumental to the task of identifying wind turbines [19,20].\n\nSimilar to NNs, CNNs are composed of node layers acting as a linear regression model followed by a nonlinear activation function that prevents them from collapsing into a single linear model and allows the network to represent more complicated relationships. CNNs are composed primarily of three node layers: convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected (FC) layers.\n\nIn an effort to improve the performance of autonomous wind turbine inspection, this paper analyzes and compares the effects of applying fuzzy contrast enhancement (FCE) to three machine learning methods trained on the preliminary stage of wind turbine inspection: classifying whether RGB images contain wind turbines. If FCE successfully improves the performance of wind turbine detection, it may be evaluated in future research to improve the performance of other stages of wind turbine inspection as well, such as through the enhancement of defects in images of wind turbine blades. Fuzzification is used in an attempt to make the wind turbines more noticeable in the RGB aerial images via FCE preprocessing. This can potentially be manipulated to further increase accuracy in all the tested machine learning methods. The machine learning algorithms explored are the visual geometry group model 19 (VGG19), Xception, and SVM. The VGG19 and Xception architectures were selected to represent the state of the art for evaluation of FCE. SVM is a lightweight machine learning approach; it was selected to evaluate the performance of FCE on an algorithm that requires fewer computational resources. To our knowledge, FCE has not been applied to Xception previously. It has been applied to VGG16, a precursor to VGG19 [21,22]. However, we found no instances where it has been applied to VGG19 through our research. FCE has previously been applied to SVM, so the performance of this algorithm is included here as a baseline for comparison with the VGG19 and Xception deep learning algorithms [21].\n\nAn overview of our approach to training and testing the machine learning (ML) algorithms adopted in this study is summarized in Figure 1. A dataset of 4500 aerial RGB images was captured by a DJI Matrice 300 RTK drone with Zenmuse L1 RGB camera at Utah Valley University (UVU). The images were used to train the three network architectures: the SVM machine learning approach and the VGG19 and Xception deep learning approaches. The hyperparameters within these networks were tuned, and the effects of applying the proposed FCE algorithm were explored by implementing fifteen case studies: A1–A5, B1–B6, and C1–C4. For each architecture, the first corresponding case studies found the set of hyperparameters that performed best for that architecture. Afterwards, the proposed FCE was applied to each architecture tuned with the corresponding best performing set of hyperparameters. The best results from each network architecture were then compared to determine the most suitable method for wind turbine recognition in RGB images. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\nImplementation of the proposed fuzzy contrast enhancement (FCE) image preprocessing step for VGG19, Xception and SVM algorithms. Additionally, the performances of all algorithms without and with the proposed FCE were analyzed and compared.\n\nCreation of a novel RGB dataset of 4500 aerial images from a Primus Air Max small wind turbine mimicking the environment of a wind turbine farm using a small-scale wind turbine prototype to compare the performance of the three ML algorithms.\n\nDetailed analyses and implementation of the VGG19, Xception, and SVM algorithms using different optimization methods, model training, and hyperparameter tuning technologies.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: The architectures of the VGG19, Xception, and SVM networks are described in Section 2 and Section 3. The fuzzy contrast enhancement is detailed in Section 4. The formulation and process of hyperparameter tuning, including categories, batch size, loss function, and dropout, are presented in Section 5. The generated dataset of 4500 RGB images and experimental results of the fifteen case studies are presented in Section 6. The last section summarizes the findings, followed by suggestions for future work.\n\n2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n\nCNNs are a type of neural network that is particularly well-suited for image classification and recognition tasks. They are composed of one or more convolutional layers, which perform the convolution operation on the input data. An example of this transformation is shown in Figure 2. In this operation, a kernel is slid along the input layer, computing the elementwise product between the kernel and each portion of the input layer. The sum of these products is then arranged in a new 2-D array of weights known as the feature map, which is the output of the convolution layer [20].\n\nCNNs use pooling layers to reduce the size of the input data. This reduces the complexity and increases the efficiency of the neural network. Another feature commonly used in CNNs is the fully connected (FC) layer. As the name suggests, this layer maps every input node to every output node. The final layer in a CNN is typically an FC layer, as this layer can make connections between all of the data at the end of the network and the final network output. This enables the final nodes in the CNN to contain the likelihood that the input image belongs to each class [19]. The CNN architectures used in this research, both VGG19 and Xception, were created and trained using the Keras software package available for the Python programming language [23].\n\n2.1. VGG19\n\nOne of the architectures explored in this paper focuses on transfer learning built on a VGG network, a fundamental yet renowned machine learning algorithm introduced by Andrew Zisserman and Karen Simonyan [24]. In order to maneuver large-scale pictures, the VGG model analyzes the depth of layers using a relatively small convolutional filter size ( 3 × 3 ) [25]. The pretrained visual geometry group model 19 (VGG19) was trained on the ImageNet database of more than a million images from 1000 classes. All database images were RGB of size 224 × 224 pixels [26].\n\nThe first 16 layers of VGG19 are convolution layers and the last 3 layers are dense (fully connected) layers [26]. Five blocks of convolution are present in VGG19. Each block goes along with one MaxPool Layer. Block 1: The depth of filters is 64 with two convolution layers. Block 2: The depth of filters is 128, with two convolution layers. Block 3: The depth of filters is 256, with four convolution layers. Block 4 and Block 5: The depth of filters is 512, with four convolution layers [27]. The architecture of the model is summarized in detail in Table 1.\n\nThere are three potential approaches for the application of transfer learning on VGG19. The first approach runs the convolution base on an image dataset, recording its output to a Numpy array on the disk storage and then using this data as input to a densely-connected classifier. This solution is fast and computationally inexpensive to execute as it only requires running the convolution base once for each input image. The second approach runs the whole model front-to-end every time the image passes through the convolution base prior to reaching the dense layer. This increases accuracy at the cost of speed. This is the most widely used approach since it balances between the model performance and speed. The third approach is fine-tuning, which consists of unfreezing a few of the top layers of a model base used for feature extraction and simultaneously training both the fully connected classifier and these top layers. This method is computationally costly but suitable when the training images are quite different from the those in the ImageNet database [27].\n\nVGG19 is useful because it is a CNN with an uncomplicated structure that is effective at image classification. It is therefore suitable for wind turbine classification, and this paper includes an emphasis on the VGG19 model as one of the three methods to classify wind turbines in the RGB image dataset created at UVU and to evaluate the FCE algorithm.\n\n2.2. Xception\n\nThe Xception architecture is a CNN evolved from Inception, a similar class of CNN originally presented in [28]. The first variant of Inception, Inception-v1, replaces the traditional convolution layer with the Inception module, a collection of multiple convolution operations of varying kernel sizes. The Inception architecture was subsequently refined (Inception-v2) and followed by Inception-v3. Inception-v2 integrates batch normalization within the model’s architecture [29]. Inception-v3 modifies the convolution kernel to increase the architecture’s computational efficiency [30].\n\nIn [31], the author recognized that the Inception module factors the traditional CNN convolution layer into components that separately perform spatial and cross-channel correlations. Therefore, they presented the hypothesis that spatial and cross-channel correlations can be entirely separated. The result was named Xception, short for Extreme Inception, which replaces the Inception module with depthwise separable convolution layers known as Xception modules. Xception outperformed Inception-v3 on both datasets that were tested [31].\n\nThe Xception network architecture has been implemented for a variety of applications, including microcrack detection on solar panels from electroluminescence images [32], identification of medicinal plants from RGB images [33], and detection of faces created by a generative adversarial network [34]. Additionally, the Xception module has been implemented independently of the Xception network, such as in [35], which used the Xception module in a modified version of the U-Net CNN network architecture to extract buildings from high-resolution remote sensing images.\n\nXception differs from VGG19 due to the Xception module and residual connections that it implements, where data are passed directly from earlier layers in the architecture to later layers by bypassing intermediate layers. These attributes tend to increase the accuracy of the model, which increases its suitability for wind turbine classification, at the cost of computational complexity. As such, the Xception architecture was selected to evaluate the performance of FCE on a complex, nonlinear architecture. The structure of the Xception network architecture used in the case studies presented in this paper, which was abbreviated from the version of the Xception architecture in [31], is illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n\nSupport vector machines have emerged as a well-established and widely-used machine learning algorithm for solving classification and regression problems. While they may not be as novel or as performant as techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or other advanced machine learning algorithms, SVMs still offer several advantages that make them a reasonable option, particularly in scenarios where computational efficiency and interpretability are important [36].\n\nAt the core of SVMs lies the principle of margin maximization, which aims to find a decision boundary that maximally separates different classes. By identifying the hyperplane with the largest possible margin between the nearest data points of different classes, SVMs exhibit good generalization performance. This makes them suitable for applications where robust classification is desired, even in the presence of noisy or overlapping data [37].\n\nOne of the key advantages of SVMs is their ability to handle nonlinear classification tasks. By employing kernel functions, such as the linear, polynomial, or radial basis function (RBF) kernels, SVMs can implicitly map the data into a higher-dimensional feature space where linear separation becomes possible [38]. This “kernel trick” eliminates the need to explicitly compute the transformed feature space, making SVMs computationally lighter compared to explicit feature mapping approaches. Furthermore, SVMs offer interpretability, which is a valuable characteristic in domains where model transparency and clarity are essential [39]. The trained SVM models provide insights into the decision-making process, allowing users to understand and interpret the factors influencing the classification outcome. This interpretability can be crucial in domains such as healthcare, finance, legal applications, or, in this case, environmental science, where accountability and trust are essential.\n\nAnother advantage of SVMs is their robustness to overfitting, provided that appropriate regularization techniques are employed. SVMs inherently seek to find the decision boundary with the largest margin, which promotes a balance between model complexity and generalization ability. This makes SVMs less prone to overfitting compared to more complex models [40].\n\nIn addition, SVMs offer computational efficiency compared to more computationally demanding techniques like deep neural networks. This computational efficiency makes SVMs suitable for situations with limited computational resources and/or real-time processing requirements such as automated real-time detection of wind turbines in RGB images captured by drones discussed in this paper. SVM was therefore selected for evaluation of FCE preprocessing on a lightweight, computationally inexpensive architecture. However, it is anticipated that SVM will not perform as well as the selected deep learning architectures due to the limitations inherent in SVM’s low-complexity design. SVM was implemented using the SVM architecture available through the scikit-learn package for Python [41].\n\n4. Proposed Image Preprocessing with Fuzzy Contrast Enhancement (FCE)\n\nPreprocessing of a dataset when performing artificial intelligence (AI) tasks can ensure data fidelity and continuity. In this section, we implement a preprocessing step to improve the quality and contrast of the created dataset (Section 6.1) before executing the AI algorithms. It is anticipated that the proposed fuzzy contrast enhancement (FCE) preprocessing step will improve the quality of the dataset by increasing the contrast of the images such that machine learning architectures will be able to more easily identify the features differentiating the classes of images in the dataset, leading to higher classification accuracy. To perform FCE, the RGB images were first transformed to the CIELAB color space, and then their intensity component was amplified using fuzzy logic. Conversion to and from the CIELAB color space was accomplished using the OpenCV package available for Python [42]. Amplification of the images’ intensity components was performed through custom software using the Python language and the NumPy package available for Python [43].\n\n4.1. CIELAB Color Space\n\nCIELAB is a three-dimensional device-independent color space model that represents the entire range of human photopic (daylight) vision. It is known to better mimic human vision which helps to identify small differences in color, and alter and isolate specific channels of the image. In an RGB image, the three present channels are red, green, and blue; thus, changing one of these three values will change the overall appearance of the image, but only based on color. In contrast, CIELAB color space has different channels that not only involve the color but also the intensity/lightness of an image.\n\nThe CIELAB color space was built from three channels that are perpendicular to one another. The a*, b*, and L* channels are relative to colors green to red, blue to yellow, and black to white, respectively [44]. The L* channel represents pixel intensity and closely matches human perception of lightness or achromatic colors, the shades of grey. For example, L* = 0 and L* = 1 denote pure black and white, respectively. Each color is represented by a color point (L*, a*, b*) in the color space [44]. CIELAB color space is selected because it is useful for detecting and predicting small differences in color of the images.\n\n4.2. Fuzzification of Image Pixel Intensity\n\nFuzzy logic refers to the generalization of a real number, which is a fuzzy number. It introduces a connected set of possible values, where each value has a weight between 0 and 1. Therefore, it is possible to use fuzzy numbers in the area between two values so that a certain classification or result is not rigidly bound to either one of the two values. In this paper, fuzzy logic is selected for contrast enhancement due to its simplicity and robust outcomes, particularly in classification problems, where values exhibit confidence intervals.\n\nTo perform FCE, fuzzy logic rules were used to amplify channel L* (pixel intensity) with a value of 0 being black and 255 being pure white. After isolating the L* channel in the CIELAB color space, the image undergoes fuzzification using the specified fuzzy rule set [21,45]. This rule set is comprised of a predefined inventory of interval values in which the L* of each pixel is categorized. Gaussian membership functions were used to establish these intervals using if-then rules. The functions vary according to each set of intervals defined for the L* value of the pixel. In this setting, each of the intervals get a classification title: “Extremely Dark (ED)”, “Very Dark (VD)”, “Dark (Da)”, “Slightly Dark (SD)”, “Slightly Bright (SB)”, “Bright (Br)”, “Very Bright (VB)”, and “Extremely Bright (EB)” (see Figure 4). While the intervals for each of these classifications are different, the base equation is the same, a Gaussian function is given by (1)\n\nμ ( x ; μ , s ) = e x p ( − 1 2 ( x − μ s ) 2 )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x is the pixel value, μ or ‘M’ is the mean (the average pixel value of the given image) and s is the standard deviation of pixel values in the given image. Figure 4 shows the fuzzy membership functions for μ = 128 .\n\nAfter assigning the new classification to the pixel, the proposed fuzzy rule set becomes operational (Figure 5). The execution involves utilizing fuzzy rules for elevating all classifications by one level to achieve contrast enhancement (Algorithm 1, [45]). For example, if a pixel receives a classification of “Very Dark (VD)” then according to our fuzzy rule set, the new fuzzified classification would be “Extremely Dark (ED)”, and so on. This rule set eliminates any “Slightly Bright (SB)” or “Slightly Dark (SD)” classifications. By applying Algorithm 1 to images of wind turbines, these contrast modifications will be applied as defined by the if-then rules. This will lead to contrast enhancement in the images, where an increase in the overall accuracy of the ML architectures is anticipated. A visualization of images processed with this FCE algorithm is given in Figure 6, and results indicating the effectiveness of FCE are presented in Section 7 as well as Table 2 and Table 3 and Figure 7 and Figure 8.\n\nAlgorithm 1 Fuzzy Logic-Based Image Contrast EnhancementInput: Aerial RGB image\n\nOutput: Aerial RGB image with fuzzy contrast enhancement\n\n1:\n\nConvert input image from RGB to CIELAB color space and calculate the average pixel intensity ( μ ) of the image\n\n2:\n\nFuzzification: For each pixel, calculate degree of membership of each class based on pixel intensity and μ value; intensity ∈ [ 0 , 255 ]\n\n3:\n\nInference: Calculate the output fuzzy set from the input pixel intensity based on the following rule set:\n\nIf input is “Very Dark (VD)” then output is “Extremely Dark (ED)”\n\nIf input is “Dark (Da)” then output is “Very Dark (VD)”\n\nIf input is “Slightly Dark (SD)” then output is “Dark (Da)”\n\nIf input is “Slightly Bright (SB)” then output is “Bright (Br)”\n\nIf input is “Bright (Br)” then output is “Very Bright (VB)”\n\nIf input is “Very Bright (VB)” then output is “Extremely Bright (EB)”.\n\n4:\n\nDefuzzification: For each pixel, calculate the centroid value of its output fuzzy set; centroid ∈ [ − 50 , 305 ]\n\n5:\n\nNormalize output pixel intensity from [ − 50 , 305 ] to [ 0 , 255 ]\n\n6:\n\nMerge modified L* channel to the original a*b* channels\n\n7:\n\nConvert output image from CIELAB color space to RGB\n\n5. Hyperparameter Tuning\n\nThe three ML approaches used in this research (VGG19, Xception, and SVM) were further tweaked to tune the network architectures for the detection of wind turbines through the selection of hyperparameters: parameters of a network that can be modified before training to improve model performance [46]. As the number of hyperparameters can increase significantly, the process of determining the ideal hyperparameters for the network becomes computationally expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, a method of determining productive hyperparameters must be used [46]. Due to its association with the popular deep learning framework Keras and its strong results, KerasTuner was used to tune the hyperparameter values [23,47]. Of the hyperparameter algorithms provided by KerasTuner, Bayesian optimization and the Hyperband algorithm were explored. Bayesian optimization is a very efficient method as it takes into account past hyperparameter performance for the future decision. Hyperband is beneficial because it early-stops poor-performing sets of hyperparameter optimization in exchange for more emphasis on more promising sets of hyperparameters. Additionally, RandomSearch was tested briefly until it was apparent the other options were superior. RandomSearch is a method in which random combinations of hyperparameters are selected and used to train a model, resulting in reducing the number of hyperparameter configurations searched [47]. The Bayesian optimization hyperparameter algorithm assumes the optimization function comes from a Gaussian process. Based on all previous evaluations, the algorithm builds a probabilistic function on this assumption and attempts to optimize hyperparameters. Bayesian optimization is a black box approach, as the function being optimized is never directly identified [48].\n\nThe Hyperband algorithm employs a different approach called successive halving where each hyperparameter configuration is given a computational budget. After the budget is consumed, the algorithm filters through and determines the worst-performing configurations, terminating them. The remaining configurations are given another computational budget and the process continues until the most performant configuration remains. The algorithm assumes that all configurations can be stopped early and evaluated [49].\n\n5.1. Hyperparameter Categories\n\nMany categories of hyperparameters are available: some are specific to the type of model being used and the task being performed; others have a broader scope and can be applied to multiple models. The tuning performed in this research focuses on the latter. Specifically, the hyperparameters explored in this research include the network’s optimizer type, activation function, batch size, loss function, and dropout, which are explored in the remainder of this section. Each hyperparameter and its corresponding values were selected and optimized using a reasonably wide search space paired with a series of case studies. Hyperparameters and values that performed well were used in future case studies while those that performed suboptimally were dropped from future consideration. The values of numerical hyperparameters, such as batch size and dropout, were selected from a pool of practical size; the values of other hyperparameters, such as optimizer and activation function, were selected using the pool of values available through the Keras software. The impact of hyperparameter selection and values on the performance of each machine learning architecture is presented in the case studies of Section 6.\n\n5.1.1. Optimizer\n\nA key hyperparameter experimented with was the optimizer. An optimizer is an equation or a set of equations that update the values of the model weights during backpropagation by traversing the gradients of the loss function, which can be represented as a multidimensional curve. The purpose of an optimizer is to find a local minimum on this curve to increase model accuracy. Various optimizers exist, and each implements a different gradient-traversal method. The optimizers explored here include Adam, NAdam, AdaMax, and RMSProp [23,50,51,52].\n\n5.1.2. Activation Functions\n\nActivation functions are nonlinear layers in neural networks that require inputs to be greater than a critical value to be passed to further layers. They prevent the network from collapsing into a singular matrix and enable the network to perform more complex tasks. Selection of the proper activation function can make a significant difference to the performance of the network [23,53,54,55,56,57,58].\n\n5.1.3. Batch Size\n\nIn calculations for gradient descent, two schools of thought are presented for the management of training sources: stochastic gradient descent and batch gradient descent. The former suggests updating the model with each training data point; the latter suggests updating the model after processing each training data point reference. However, both stochastic gradient descent and batch gradient descent have drawbacks that can be analyzed to determine which will be more effective depending on the task.\n\nA trade-off exists between the two methods. Large batch sizes benefit heavily from the highly parallel nature of machine learning; therefore, the training execution time can be greatly reduced. However, larger batch sizes require large pools of available memory to perform calculations and can be trapped in local minima in the loss function. Smaller batch sizes tend to be more noisy, allowing optimizers to break out of local minima and saddle points [59].\n\n5.1.4. Loss Function\n\nThe loss function defines the margin of error of image classification in the network during training. Three loss functions were explored here: categorical cross-entropy, binary cross-entropy, and Kullback–Leiber (KL) divergence [60,61].\n\n5.1.5. Dropout\n\nDropout is a method to prevent overfitting. Using the dropout during training, a percentage of nodes from fully connected layers are dropped from the network, preventing their weights from being used or updated. This forces the network to prioritize more than one major network path and avoid overfitting. It also simulates training multiple subnetworks and combining the results into the overall network [62].\n\n6. Experimental Results\n\n6.1. Dataset Overview and Characteristics\n\nThe machine learning algorithms introduced in Section 2 and Section 3 were trained on the created dataset of 4500 RGB images. The dataset contains two classes of images: those with wind turbines (WT class) and those without (NWT class). The WT class has 2250 images that contain a small-scale wind turbine (12V Primus Air Max wind turbine) assembled at Utah Valley University (UVU). This wind turbine is shown in Figure 6. These images were captured on a Zenmuse L1 RGB camera that was mounted on a DJI Matrice 300 RTK drone. To ensure diversity and relevance to real-world wind turbine detection scenarios, emphasis was placed on creating dataset images with diverse angles and distances to the wind turbine to simulate perspectives that are commonly observed from a drone-mounted camera in a wind turbine farm. Additionally, images were captured in multiple weather conditions at various times of day to ensure the dataset was robust. The NWT class also has 2250 images that were taken in the same location as the WT images, so both sets have similar backgrounds including trees and sky. The NWT class also contains images captured at multiple times of day with various weather patterns. Additionally, all images in the dataset were manually validated to ensure that each image had been placed in the correct class and that each image was an accurate representation of the class it had been placed in.\n\nThe analysis of machine learning algorithms in this paper prioritized fast training times so that more experimentation and iterative improvement could occur. As a result, the images in the dataset were downscaled to 210 × 210 pixels. Additionally, the dataset is separated into 3150 training images and 1350 test images to verify the performance of the machine learning algorithms using previously unseen data. A selection of images from this dataset is displayed in Figure 6, where Figure 6a,b show sample images from the NWT and WT classes, respectively. Figure 6c,d show corresponding images after the application of the proposed FCE preprocessing technique of Section 4.\n\n6.2. VGG19 Experimental Results\n\nThe VGG19 network used the weights of the ImageNet dataset to expedite feature extraction, and the dense classifier on top helped in identifying whether there was a turbine in the image or not. The dense classifier had a total of six layers. The VGG base and dense classifier were trained concurrently for better results as described in Section 2.1. The number of neurons in the last layers depends on the number of classes in the training data, which is an important detail to remember. Since there are only two classes (turbine or no turbine) in the training database, the final layer contains two neurons. The VGG19 network underwent several hyperparameter searches and tuning in order to determine the combination of parameters that would perform the best on the dataset. This took place in Case Studies A1–A3 on images downscaled to 135 × 85 pixels so that successful hyperparameters could be identified more quickly due to the increased training speeds associated with smaller images. Case Studies A4–A5 apply the resulting hyperparameters to the 210 × 210 pixel dataset described at the start of this section for evaluation of fuzzy contrast enhancement. The sections that follow outline the design and results of these studies.\n\n6.2.1. VGG19 Case Study A1\n\nCase Study A1 used the RMSProp optimizer in grid search for the VGG19 network. The network’s dropout rate, image batch size, and optimizer learning rate were the hyperparameters selected for the grid search, while the validation accuracy was used to measure optimization. The image batch size was tested with values of 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 50, and 120, the optimizer learning rate with values of 10 − 5 , 10 − 4 , 5 × 10 − 4 , 10 − 3 , 10 − 2 , and 10 − 1 , and the dropout rate with values of 10%, 20%, and 30%. Each set of hyperparameters was trained on the wind turbine dataset for 100 iterations. Table 4 lists the best-performing hyperparameters for each search.\n\n6.2.2. VGG19 Case Study A2\n\nSince the VGG19 network received beneficial results with RMSProp, Case Study A2 used the same combination but with a different search space of the hyperparameters and a different search algorithm. The network’s dropout rate, image batch size, and optimizer learning rate were again chosen as the hyperparameters, but this time for the Bayesian optimization search. The validation accuracy was used as a measure to be optimized. The image batch size was tested with values of 20, 50, 100, 150, 300, 350, and 400, and the dropout rate was tested with values of 20%, 30%, and 50%. The optimizer learning rate was tested with the same values as Case Study A1. The wind turbine dataset was used to train for 100 iterations of all hyperparameter options. Table 4 lists the best-performing hyperparameters for each search. The performance of the VGG19 architecture with RMSProp in Case Study A2 was comparable to results from Case Study A1.\n\n6.2.3. VGG19 Case Study A3\n\nThis case study is very similar to Case Study A2. Since VGG19 performed well with RMSProp, the same hyperparameters were used in Case Study A3. The same search space for the hyperparameters was also used, but it was implemented via the Hyperband algorithm instead of Bayesian or grid search. The best-performing hyperparameters for each search are listed in Table 4. Across Case Studies A1 through A3, all combinations of hyperparameter values performed reasonably well.\n\n6.2.4. VGG19 Case Study A4\n\nTo obtain the final evaluation of VGG19’s performance for comparison with the other deep learning methods explored, VGG19 was retrained using only the top performing set of hyperparameters from Table 4; each image from the created dataset was then classified by this trained network. The results were gathered into a confusion matrix from which performance metrics such as accuracy and precision were calculated. The results of this process were averaged across 10 separate runs and the highest accuracy overall was recorded. The resulting averaged performance metrics, as well as the confusion matrix with the highest accuracy for this model, are given in Figure 7a.\n\n6.2.5. VGG19 Case Study A5\n\nThis case study tested the impact of fuzzy contrast enhancement as a preprocessing step on the image dataset for the VGG19 network. Its procedure replicated that of Case Study A4 in many ways. However, it differed in the addition of image preprocessing and a lower batch size of 128 rather than 300 which was used previously. These results are shown in Figure 8a and Table 3.\n\n6.3. Xception Experimental Results\n\nSix case studies of hyperparameter searches were conducted on the Xception network to find the combination which performed best on the wind turbine dataset. In order to increase the speed of hyperparameter selection, Case Studies B1–B4 used images downscaled to 135 × 85 pixels. Once hyperparameters had been identified which consistently performed well, they were applied to the larger 210 × 210 pixel images for evaluation of fuzzy contrast enhancement in Case Studies B5–B6. More information on the performance of each is described in the sections that follow.\n\n6.3.1. Xception Case Study B1\n\nThis case study paired the Xception network with the Adam optimizer while image batch size, optimizer learning rate, and the network’s dropout rate were allowed to vary as hyperparameters. The image batch size was tested with values of 1, 5, 10, 20, 32, 64, and 128, the optimizer learning rate was tested with values of 10 − 5 , 10 − 4 , 5 × 10 − 4 , 10 − 3 , 2 × 10 − 2 , and 10 − 2 , and the network dropout rate was tested with values ranging from 0% to 95% in 5% increments. For this case study, the hyperparameters were tuned with KerasTuner’s RandomSearch algorithm. Additionally, the results were averaged from three independent executions, and each search was trained for 30 epochs but set to stop early if epoch loss did not improve for three epochs.\n\nThe results from this case study are visualized in Figure 9. Notably, the batch sizes in the middle of the selected range (5, 10, 20, and 32) consistently performed with high accuracies (90–95%), while the extremes in the tested batch size range (1, 64, and 128) consistently had low accuracies (50–60%). The best hyperparameters are given in Table 5 under Case Study B1.\n\n6.3.2. Xception Case Study B2\n\nIn this case study, the hyperparameters were tuned using KerasTuner’s Bayesian optimization tuner. These hyperparameters included the dropout ratio, the learning rate, the activation function used in Xception’s final layer, the optimizer paired with the Xception network, and conditional inclusion of the dropout layer. The optimizer was tested with Adam and NAdam, the final layer activation function was tested with Softmax and Sigmoid, and the dropout ratio was tested with values of 0% through 90% in 10% increments when the dropout layer was included.\n\nDuring training, the learning rate was allowed to vary logarithmically with a minimum value of 10 − 5 and a maximum value of 10 − 1 . This assigns equal probabilities to each order of magnitude range [47]. The results from Case Study B2 are given in Figure 10, where it can be seen that Softmax consistently performed poorly as Xception’s final layer activation function, while Sigmoid consistently performed well. Softmax was removed from further trials for this reason. The hyperparameters that consistently performed well in this case study are listed in Table 5 under Case Study B2.\n\n6.3.3. Xception Case Study B3\n\nThis case study focused on tuning the Adam optimizer’s learning rate, Beta1, Beta2, Epsilon, and AMSGrad inputs as well as dropout ratio and batch size using Bayesian optimization. Each combination of hyperparameters was independently executed ten times, and the results of each were averaged to obtain each search’s final outcomes.\n\nThe hyperparameters were tested with values of 10 − 4 , 5 × 10 − 4 , 10 − 3 , and 2 × 10 − 3 for the learning rate, 0.0 and 0.9 for Beta1, 0.0, 0.99, 0.999, and 0.9999 for Beta2, 10 − 7 , 10 − 1 , and 1.0 for Epsilon, true or false for AMSGrad, and 0% through 50% in 5% increments for the dropout ratio. The batch sizes were tested with the same values as Case Study B1. The available values for Beta1 and Beta2 were selected based on [63], with Beta2 being modified to include a value of 0.0. The available values for Epsilon were selected from the Keras documentation. The results from Case Study B3 are visualized in Figure 11, and the hyperparameters with the highest average accuracies from this case study are listed in Table 5 under Case Study B3. The hyperparameters with the consistent best performance had batch sizes in the middle of the tested range (5, 10, 20) and dropout ratios in the upper half of the tested range (25–45%).\n\n6.3.4. Xception Case Study B4\n\nThis trial used the same hyperparameters with the same tested values as Case Study B3, but they were tuned with the Hyperband algorithm rather than the Bayesian optimization algorithm. The results are visualized in Figure 12, and the hyperparameters that had the highest averaged accuracies are given in Table 5 under Case Study B4. In Figure 12, note that the accuracies at the low-end of the scale are about 88%. In other case studies, the low end of the scale for accuracies ranged from 50% to about 68%. The Hyperband algorithm resulted in higher accuracies.\n\nAcross Case Studies B1 through B4, very low and very high batch sizes (below 5 and above 64) tended to perform poorly. Additionally, the NAdam optimizer and the Softmax final layer activation function performed poorly in combination with the other hyperparameters and values selected in Case Studies B1 through B4. The inclusion of the dropout layer was also a key hyperparameter: performance significantly decreased when the dropout layer was not included in the architecture. Overall, the best results were attained when using medium-range batches sizes (5 through 32), the Adam optimizer, the Sigmoid final layer activation function, and when a dropout layer was included in the architecture.\n\n6.3.5. Xception Case Study B5\n\nIn this case study, fine-tuning was implemented for the Xception network structure. The model was initialized with weights pretrained on the ImageNet dataset and given a densely connected final layer. Where appropriate, the model was assigned with the top set of hyperparameters from Table 5. To prepare the network for fine-tuning, the pretrained weights were frozen, while the final dense layer was trained on the wind turbine dataset. During fine-tuning, the final seventeen layers, including the densely connected layer, were unfrozen and trained with one-tenth of the learning rate used in the fine-tuning preparation stage. The model was evaluated using the process described in VGG19 Case Study A4. The results are illustrated in Figure 7b and Table 2.\n\n6.3.6. Xception Case Study B6\n\nThis case study analyzed the effect of implementing fuzzy contrast enhancement as a preprocessing step for the Xception network. Its procedure mirrored that of Case Study B5 with the only difference being the addition of image preprocessing. These results are given in Figure 8b and Table 3.\n\n6.4. SVM Experimental Results\n\nExperiments in this section were undertaken to explore the effects of the proposed FCE image preprocessing of Section 4 on the performance and accuracy of the SVM algorithm. Four SVM case studies were conducted, encompassing default hyperparameter settings and Bayesian optimization, both with and without FCE image preprocessing.\n\n6.4.1. SVM Case Study C1\n\nIn the first case study with SVM, the default hyperparameters were used. The model was built using the Scikit-learn library in Python and no hyperparameter values were altered. The default hyperparameter values are C = 1, Gamma = Scale, and Kernel = rbf. These hyperparameter values are the same for any SVM built using Scikit-learn in Python.\n\n6.4.2. SVM Case Study C2\n\nThe second case study with SVM is executed using Bayesian optimization instead of the default hyperparameters setting. This study aims to identify the optimal combination of hyperparameters to attain the highest accuracy for our model. The results are presented in Figure 7c and Table 2.\n\n6.4.3. SVM Case Study C3\n\nThe third SVM case study mirrors Case Study C1 by relying on default hyperparameters. However, it incorporates the proposed FCE procedure outlined in Section 4. Consequently, a preprocessing step is integrated into the SVM algorithm to modulate the intensity of all images within the generated dataset. This study aims to establish a baseline accuracy when implementing fuzzy contrast enhancement, providing a benchmark for comparison with the accuracy achieved in the subsequent section.\n\n6.4.4. SVM Case Study C4\n\nThe ultimate SVM study integrated elements from both Case Study C2 and C3, incorporating both Bayesian optimization and the proposed FCE preprocessing step of Section 4. The application of these combined techniques generated the highest accuracy attained by the SVM model. Comprehensive results and details of this conclusive case study are presented in Figure 8c and Table 3.\n\n7. Conclusions\n\nThis paper examines and contrasts the impact of applying fuzzy contrast enhancement (FCE) as an image preprocessing algorithm to various strategies for detecting the presence of wind turbines in RGB images, an initial key aspect of autonomous wind turbine inspection. The three methods under investigation are VGG19, Xception, and SVM. The primary contributions of this paper encompass the following:\n\nA comprehensive exploration, implementation, and comparison of three distinct machine learning algorithms, comprising two convolutional neural networks and the SVM algorithm. These algorithms are utilized to classify whether RGB images contain wind turbines.\n\nThe application of the proposed fuzzy contrast enhancement (FCE) data preprocessing step to the VGG19, Xception, and SVM machine learning algorithms, accompanied by a comparison of their conventional performance against their performance when augmented by this preprocessing step.\n\nThe creation of a novel Primus Air Max wind turbine classification dataset, consisting of 4500 RGB images, and its utilization to assess the performance of the implemented VGG19, Xception, and SVM algorithms.\n\nBased on our analysis, primary conclusions are as follows:\n\nThe assessed convolutional neural networks, namely Xception and VGG19, demonstrated commendable performances with accuracies above 98%. In contrast, as anticipated, the SVM algorithm exhibited a less favorable accuracy of around 90%.\n\nThe implementation of the proposed FCE results in enhanced accuracy for Xception and SVM, while VGG19 does not experience similar improvements.\n\nThe results presented in Figure 7 and Figure 8 and Table 2 and Table 3 demonstrate that implementing the proposed FCE leads to improvements in accuracy, precision, and F1 score. Specifically, for the Xception model, these metrics increase from 99%, 99.2%, and 98.99% to 99.18%, 99.5%, and 99.18%, respectively. Similarly, for the SVM algorithm, the application of FCE raises accuracy, precision, and F1 score from 90.3%, 91%, and 90.12% to 95.48%, 95.63%, and 95.48%, respectively.\n\nIn summary, FCE as a data preprocessing algorithm for wind turbine detection is promising: two of the explored machine learning architectures experienced a performance increase when this algorithm was applied. Future research into autonomous condition monitoring of wind turbines may similarly benefit from applying FCE as a dataset preprocessing step. For future investigations, the authors intend to expand the existing dataset to incorporate RGB images depicting both intact and defective wind turbine blades, with and without cracks. Further enhancements and training of the Xception, VGG19, and SVM algorithms are envisaged to facilitate their utilization in automated drone path planning, enabling the autonomous detection of faults in wind turbine blades.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization, M.A.S.M. and M.S.; methodology, Z.W. and M.A.S.M.; software, Z.W., J.M. and J.E.; validation, Z.W., J.M., J.E., M.A.S.M. and M.S.; formal analysis, Z.W., J.M., J.E. and M.A.S.M.; investigation, Z.W., J.M., J.E., M.A.S.M. and M.S.; resources, M.A.S.M. and M.S.; data curation, M.A.S.M. and M.S.; writing—original draft preparation, Z.W., J.M., J.E., M.A.S.M. and M.S.; writing—review and editing, M.A.S.M., M.S. and A.S.; visualization, Z.W., J.M., J.E., M.A.S.M. and M.S; supervision, M.A.S.M. and M.S.; project administration, M.A.S.M. and M.S.; funding acquisition, M.A.S.M. and M.S.

      "# [From HPC to AI: Evolution and Performance Evaluation of File Systems by Weizheng Lu on 2024-05-23](https://juicefs.com/en/blog/user-stories/hpc-ai-file-system)\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) technology rapidly develops, the scale and complexity of models, as well as the volume of data to be processed, are rising sharply. These trends make high-performance computing (HPC) increasingly necessary. HPC integrates powerful computing resources such as GPU and CPU clusters to provide the computing power needed to process and analyze large-scale data.\n\nHowever, this also brings new challenges, especially in the storage system, including how to effectively handle large amounts of data and ensure efficient data access and operations costs.\n\nDistributed file systems, as a high-cost, high-benefit solution, are gradually being widely adopted in AI and HPC scenarios. They distribute storage resources across multiple nodes, effectively handling and managing large datasets to meet HPC's high demands for data access speed.\n\nRenmin University of China, one of the top universities in China, has conducted research in the fields of file systems for AI. Our HPC center provides strong support for scientific research. We’ve conducted preliminary performance evaluations of mainstream distributed file systems, including Lustre, Alluxio, and JuiceFS.\n\nIn this article, we’ll deep dive into the data patterns and characteristics of HPC, big data, and AI applications. Then, we’ll share common performance evaluation tools and our evaluation results of several file systems. We hope this post can provide valuable references for users choosing HPC and AI storage solutions.\n\nLarge-scale data application scenarios: HPC vs. big data vs. AI\n\nHigh-performance computing\n\nHPC plays a critical role in scientific research and engineering applications, such as climate prediction, protein folding, and computational fluid dynamics. Unlike the methods employed by machine learning and AI, HPC often relies on simulation and scientific formulas to solve complex problems.\n\nIn HPC, tasks can be divided into compute-intensive and data-intensive. For example, weather forecasting requires a large amount of computing resources to simulate weather and also needs to process and analyze large volumes of data. Compute-intensive tasks such as molecular dynamics simulations are compute-intensive and less dependent on data.\n\nThe following figure (source: Introduction to HPC: What are HPC & HPC Clusters?) shows an HPC cluster architecture:\n\nHPC environments typically use high-bandwidth, low-latency networks such as InfiniBand to support fast data transfer. In terms of software configuration, efficient data communication between multiple nodes depends on standards like the message passing interface (MPI).\n\nIn addition, the application of GPUs in HPC is increasing, which accelerates various computing tasks. Compared to traditional data centers, HPC clusters significantly differ in their network configuration and use of shared file systems.\n\nBig data\n\nDifferent from HPC, big data applications are more common in internet companies. This is mainly because these companies can continuously collect large volumes of user data, like user behaviors and uploaded content. These are usually structured data like user behaviors and unstructured data, such as images, audios, and videos.\n\nIn these companies, big data engineers are often responsible for extract-transform-load (ETL) work. This involves extracting, transforming, and loading data into data warehouses, where data is processed and organized for analysis or machine learning use. Unlike compute-intensive tasks in HPC, big data applications focus more on data processing and analysis.\n\nThe following figure (source: Data Warehouse Architecture: Traditional vs. Cloud Models) shows a big data analysis architecture:\n\nCost is a significant consideration in big data applications. Internet companies prefer to use cost-effective standard hardware and open-source software to control expenses. For example, open-source software like Hadoop is widely adopted due to its robust community support and maturity. Internet companies can choose suitable software solutions based on their needs, whether opting for open-source versions or selecting commercial versions for support.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI)\n\nIn recent years, the development in the AI field has been widely acknowledged. Its workloads include training and inference. Particularly, with the emergence of large-scale models such as GPT and BERT, AI's dependence on HPC has deepened. These complex models urgently require robust computing resources to shorten training time; at the same time, they also bring challenges regarding efficient management of large datasets.\n\nThe following figure (source: ML Workflows: What Can You Automate?) shows an AI pipeline:\n\nIn this context, file systems face specific requirements, especially when handling numerous small image or video files. These files typically range from a few kilobytes to several megabytes, imposing high demands on IOPS.\n\nThere’s a notable characteristic during AI model training, that is, the same data would be used for multiple training jobs at the same time. Machine learning engineers and scientists would experiment with different hyper-parameters, modifying network architectures and trying various optimization techniques on the same data.\n\nTherefore, AI model training is not only a compute-intensive task but also a process that requires meticulous adjustments and fine-tuning. This method of continuously adjusting parameters and model structures is key to achieving efficient and accurate AI models.\n\nIn this background, data preprocessing is particularly critical in AI model training. For example, Hugging Face’ Falcon demonstrates the importance of data preprocessing in handling large-scale models. They established a long processing pipeline for handling large model data, starting from raw external web data and undergoing multiple preprocessing steps such as URL filtering and deduplication.\n\nAs the figure (source: The RefinedWeb Dataset for Falcon LLM: Outperforming Curated Corpora with Web Data, and Web Data Only) below shows, each step gradually reduces the dataset size. After several processing stages, less than 10% of the data remains suitable for training large language models (LLMs). Thus, we can see that data preprocessing constitutes a substantial portion of the work in training large models, involving tasks like data cleaning, HTML tag extraction, ad filtering, and text recognition. These steps are crucial for ensuring data quality and training results.\n\nEvolution of AI applications and distributed file systems\n\nFirst, let's briefly review the evolution of file systems, where emerging needs at each stage have spurred the development of new-generation file systems.\n\nLustre, one of the earliest distributed file systems, was designed for HPC and funded by the U.S. government.\n\nThe emergence of file systems like Hadoop and S3 primarily addressed the explosive growth of internet data, along with big data processing-oriented file systems like Ceph. These systems aimed to support big data applications.\n\nWith the advent of Kubernetes, cloud-native data management and applications have gradually become the focus. This leads to the development of various emerging data management systems and applications like JuiceFS.\n\nAs the foundational infrastructure for data storage and access, file systems directly impact the training and inference processes of AI models. When applying file systems to AI scenarios, they often face two key challenges:\n\nHigh IOPS: The primary challenge is processing datasets with large amounts of small files, such as images and videos. This places high demands on file systems’ IOPS. Bandwidth is usually sufficient, but file systems’ IOPS processing capability often limits performance.\n\nPortable: The complexity of AI workflows and collaboration across teams require file systems to have high portability and compatibility. This ensures support for various data processing and model training tools, facilitating the smooth exchange and processing of data between teams.\n\nTo improve performance, some solutions adopt high-performance storage media such as SSD or NVMe and implement local caching. Here's a brief introduction to a common concept in academia: burst buffer, which refers to a cache layer between the front-end computing processes and the back-end storage systems. Different file systems provide their unique solutions. We’ll introduce them one by one in the following text.\n\nIn addressing compatibility issues, providing POSIX interfaces ensures compatibility and portability and can also lower user learning costs. POSIX refers to a series of file interfaces in the Linux operating system, and POSIX-compatible file systems means users can work with distributed file systems just like with their local machines. However, from a development perspective, implementing POSIX compatibility may incur additional development costs and complexity. Products like HDFS and Amazon S3 do not adopt complete POSIX compatibility. They require developers or users to use their pre-defined APIs or tools. This may involve changing existing usage habits and learning new tools.\n\nThe table below compares POSIX and non-POSIX file systems:\n\nCategory Pros Cons File systems POSIX Devs, ops, and software rely on POSIX , Portable Overhead Lustre, JuiceFS Non-POSIX Low cost Limited abilities , Additional code for users HDFS, S3\n\nNext, we’ll introduce several file systems suitable for AI scenarios to help you better understand the advantages and limitations of various file systems in AI applications.\n\nLustre\n\nLustre performs well in HPC scenarios because it was designed to meet the needs of supercomputers. Its support for the POSIX protocol and development using C and C++ makes Lustre very suitable for handling large-scale parallel computing tasks.\n\nThe figure below shows Lustre’s architecture:\n\nLustre's architecture is particularly suitable for typical HPC cluster environments, which include high-speed data transmission using the InfiniBand network. The cluster contains multiple computing nodes (“Computation” in the figure) and storage nodes (“Data Management” in the figure). They’re used for processing metadata by the metadata server, while the actual data is stored on object storage (“Object Storage” in the figure). This design optimizes support for MPI applications. Especially MPI-IO, the ability for multiple processes to read and write to a file simultaneously, is particularly important for parallel computing and scientific research applications.\n\nThe direct application of MPI-IO might be less common in AI and machine learning workloads. This is primarily because file operations in these applications mainly involve writing checkpoints rather than complex distributed I/O. However, the characteristics of MPI-IO remain highly important for scientific computing applications that require parallel processing and complex data interaction.\n\nIn terms of caching, the Lustre file system recently introduced a feature called Lustre Persistent Cache on Client (PCC). However, in practice, it requires a lot of configuration by operations staff.\n\nAlluxio\n\nWe attempted to deploy Alluxio as a data caching layer. Alluxio's design philosophy is mainly as a cache above underlying storage systems, such as HDFS or S3, to accelerate data access. Alluxio is particularly suitable for big data scenarios, such as using it with big data processing systems like Spark.\n\nTests in AI and machine learning scenarios have shown that its performance did not meet our expectations. In AI scenarios, especially when the initial request included datasets containing a large number of small files, this process on Alluxio was extremely slow. Taking the ImageNet dataset as an example, we noticed that it may take several hours for the data to be initially loaded into Alluxio. This severely affected performance. According to the latest news, Alluxio has also optimized for this issue, providing a storage solution designed specifically for AI. It is currently for commercial use only and not open source.\n\nThe following figure (source: Alluxio architecture) shows the Alluxio architecture:\n\nJuiceFS\n\nWe conducted preliminary proof of concept (PoC) tests on JuiceFS Community Edition and have not yet fully deployed it in our production environment.\n\nJuiceFS is a high-performance, cloud-native, distributed file system designed to provide efficient data storage and access in cloud environments.\n\nIn JuiceFS, data is stored in chunks in object storage such as S3, while metadata is stored in database systems such as Redis, MySQL, or PostgreSQL. This design makes metadata management efficient and flexible. Clients access JuiceFS through mounting the Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) interface. This enables it to seamlessly run on various operating systems. In addition, JuiceFS offers a POSIX file system interface, which is familiar to users. Moreover, JuiceFS' caching feature directly supports burst buffers.\n\nThe figure below shows the architecture of JuiceFS Community Edition:\n\nFrom a cost perspective, JuiceFS' operating costs are much lower than traditional disk arrays. This is mainly due to its cloud-native design, which effectively utilizes cloud storage resources and reduces reliance on physical hardware.\n\nBenchmark tools and PoC results\n\nWhen evaluating file system performance, benchmark tools like IOzone, MDTest, and fio are widely used to test IOPS and bandwidth. However, standard benchmark tools cannot fully reflect the requirements and load characteristics of real-world application scenarios. To obtain performance evaluations closer to actual workloads, the MLPerf tool was designed.\n\nMLPerf simulates real AI workloads for evaluation and provides a series of tests. In the computer vision field, it uses the residual neural network (ResNet) model for testing; in text processing, it uses GPT-3 or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models and test on Wikipedia or C4 datasets.\n\nThe following table outlines standard AI performance benchmarks in different domains, including vision, language processing, and recommendation systems. It specifies the datasets used in each test, the performance goals aimed at, such as accuracy and error rate, and the reference models for each test, like ResNet, BERT, and GPT-3. This provides a unified framework for evaluating and comparing AI model performance.\n\nArea Benchmark Dataset Quality target Reference implementation model Vision Image classification ImageNet 75.90% classification ResNet-50 v1.5 Vision Image segmentation (medical) KiTS19 0.908 Mean DICE score 3D U-Net Vision Object detection (light weight) Open Images 34.0% mAP RetinaNet Vision Object detection (heavy weight) COCO 0.377 Box min AP and 0.339 Mask min AP Mask R-CNN Language Speech recognition LibriSpeech 0.058 Word Error Rate RNN-T Language NLP Wikipedia 2020/01/01 0.72 Mask-LM accuracy BERT-large Language LLM C4 2.69 log perplexity GPT3 Commerce Recommendation Criteo 4TB multi-hot 0.8032 AUC DLRM-dcnv2\n\nWe used fio to compare Lustre, JuiceFS, and XFS. Below are our preliminary test results:\n\nIn terms of IOPS and bandwidth read performance, Lustre configured with full NVMe flash showed very high performance.\n\nIn testing the ImageNet dataset on PyTorch, all file systems completed the task in similar times, with JuiceFS + S3 and XFS + local SSD sharing the lowest.\n\nDuring LLM checkpoint testing, Lustre + all flash took only 1 minute, much faster than the 10 minutes of Lustre + HDD.\n\nItem Lustre + all flash Lustre + HDD JuiceFS + S3 XFS + local SSD Fio IOPS READ 2,700k 20k 14k 40k Fio BW READ 30 GB/s 12 GB/s 2.6 GB/s 0.9 GB/s ImageNet PyTorch 1,600s 1,640s 1,570s 1,570s LLM checkpoint (LLaMA 70B) 1 min 10 min\n\nConclusion\n\nThis article shared scenarios such as HPC, big data, and AI that require processing large-scale data and their data characteristics. It introduced common file systems suitable for AI scenarios and their pros and cons and showcased internal test results from Renmin University of China's HPC center.\n\nWhen enterprises choose file systems, they should not only consider benchmark results but also consider actual application needs and costs. Companies with operational capabilities may prefer open-source solutions with higher cost-effectiveness. The final choice needs to consider costs, operational capabilities, and other factors comprehensively.",
