I try to follow similar steps with the app, test user, key, etc. but can't find it or get the right access.\n\nIs Meta trying to make it extra burdensome to embed Instagram feeds outside of their platform?

Meta has indeed tightened the reins on how third-party platforms access Instagram content, primarily to bolster user privacy and data security.\n\nI also consulted GPT on this issue resulting in: ‘Instagram no longer provides a toggle switch for embedding an entire profile like it does for individual posts. The \"copy embed code\" button is only available for individual posts, reels, or videos, and not for entire profiles. This means you can't embed your whole Instagram profile using a built-in option directly from Instagram's settings, even on a professional account’.\n\nSo, if you don’t mind using a third-party solution for your use case, I could recommend you to get a plugin from the [Wordpress Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/Instagram/). It is the responsibility of their developers to ensure a proper display no matter what. \n\nFor instance, you could try our [Instagram Feed plugin](https://elfsight.com/instagram-feed-instashow/wordpress/) that lets you embed profiles and posts using multiple filters for a nice display.

It seems obvious that would be the case, why would they rank a brand higher that would then circle back and request their money back. Google' wants to make money from your leads and their access.\n\nBut people wanted their money back, so the majority disputed.

I knew what I was doing worked. In time too I was able to turn \"dead\" LSA accounts back alive. \n\nGoogle's auto-system did its job in time for the absolute horrible leads.

I see what you're saying about how Google is trying to retain the money spent on advertising, and that frequent disputes could lead to accounts being deprioritized.\n\nI've had to inform our team about the recorded Google calls, and we try to verbally say: '*We don't offer that service*' in hopes that the call will be flagged for dispute. But now that you've mentioned your approach, I realize we might need to reconsider how we manage these disputes.\n\nFor example, one of our most recent LSA lead calls involved a customer asking to refill their A/C with R-22, which has been illegal and phased out since 2020. We don't offer that service and even took the time to educate the customer on why it's no longer available. Despite clearly stating '*we don’t offer that service*,' Google's new automation didn’t catch it, and we were still charged.\n\nOn top of that, after we raised our LSA budget, we saw a massive increase in 'ghost calls'—calls where no one picks up on the customer’s end. These are impossible to dispute, but we’re still being charged for them.

For example, I have one client that sells windows, who just started LSA last month. Most of the calls to the business have been for glass repair or putting screens on windows which he does not do (he does full window frame replacments). To a human listening to the call, it is obvious that these calls are not quality leads. For whatever the reason, the \"trained\" AI thinks they are.  Although Google does have a differentiation in categories for window replacement and glass repair (we have it check marked for the former, not the latter), human end users have a hard time apparently distingusihing those service categories from one another. \n\nWe have rated each call, but haven't seen one call credited back to us. I was going to call and talk to someone but interestingly, there is no longer a phone number being shown on the account. Interesting side note, the phone number was very prominent when we we having an issue connecting the account. \n\nLastly, here are the terms as stated from Google *\"For more than a year, we’ve worked to train machine learning models to understand which leads are high quality. With Automated Local Services Ads lead credits, Google will review all leads and automatically credit invalid leads\\*.*\n\n*With this system, there is a shift and Google will no longer be able to support 'job type not serviced' and 'geo not serviced' leads. However,* ***we’ll still credit more leads on average,*** *overall, and your feedback matters more than ever. To help improve your future leads, fill in the lead feedback survey for every lead you receive in your inbox.\"*\n\nI highlighted the verbiage there becasue while that may on average be helping all users, the system still appears to be flawed in the micro-context of a particular local small business owner trying to find a way to actually get real quality leads.\n\n## Comment ID lmrctlw with +1 score by [(TTFV, Reddit, 2024-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1ff1byy/anyone_else_frustrated_with_google_lsas_new/lmrctlw/) (in reply to ID 1ff1byy):\nGood, more advertisers will move back to Google Ads ;-)\n\n### Comment ID lms9iec with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1ff1byy/anyone_else_frustrated_with_google_lsas_new/lms9iec/) (in reply to ID lmrctlw):\nI like the Google Display ads, I find they bring customers to different sections of our website.   \n  \nDuring the Summertime, we had higher bidding rates, for the HVAC industry (for LSA's) than we did for the Display ads.\n\n## Comment ID lvyinl4 with +1 score by [(Sonic_Boom1, Reddit, 2024-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1ff1byy/anyone_else_frustrated_with_google_lsas_new/lvyinl4/) (in reply to ID 1ff1byy):\nFile dispute with credit card company.

For the past 4-5 years, the plugin team at [WP.org](http://WP.org) was reviewing plugins and making them remove trademarked words from their plugin names and slugs or forcing them to use them in a correct way. This did not include only the name 'Wordpress' but any trademarked name in tech. What they were saying was basically:\n\n\"WordPress Smileys\" -> Not ok name for a plugin\n\n\"Smileys for WordPress\" -> Ok, but still dont use WordPress, use WP. To start with a WP plugin having the word WP or WordPress in the name in the *WP* repo did not make sense anyway. Its not like you could install those plugins to some other software.\n\nThey also made people remove the entire word from their plugin names if the owner of that trademark was very litiguous. So this was not something related to only WordPress but a general change of situation across the open source ecosystem.\n\n#### Comment ID lpe2kgd with +3 score by [(throwawaySecret0432, Reddit, 2024-09-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lpe2kgd/) (in reply to ID low2rdh):\nIt was WORSE with WooCommerce.

There's no shortage of companies who build walled gardens and keep the users inside, never leaking any view, click, or conversion out. WordPress makes it possible to have your own piece of the web, which you can migrate between hosts, or modify in a way that suits you. Run your own host? Feel free. In a sense, all hosts that support WordPress are also part of the open web.

That trademark is held by the WordPress Foundation. They reserve the non-profit use of the name “WordPress” for the Foundation, and the commercial use of the license is granted to Automattic. Using the “WordPress” trademark commercially requires getting approval from Automattic. Newfold Digital pays Automattic a licensing fee to use this trademark.\n\nThis post is about the WordPress Foundation additionally filing to trademark the phrase “managed WordPress.” If granted, then it would prevent companies from using the phrase “managed WordPress” when advertising their services unless they get permission from the WordPress foundation. Companies could still offer managed WordPress, but they would have to call it something else unless they get permission.\n\n## Comment ID loqyccr with +7 score by [(Rarst, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/loqyccr/) (in reply to ID 1fol35p):\nEhm... how would WPF possibly justify and protect trademarks related to hosting, since... it's not a hosting provider.\n\n### Comment ID lorfbf0 with +1 score by [(user_number_666, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lorfbf0/) (in reply to ID loqyccr):\nthank you!\n\n## Comment ID lorjoeg with +2 score by [(life3_01, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lorjoeg/) (in reply to ID 1fol35p):\nThis reminds me of the ClickFunnels debacle.

I have been around long enough to remember how this all played out.\n\nWhen the first commercial WordPress plugins came out, people lost their shit.  Everyone trying to make money on it was told you couldn't have Pro plugins and they needed to be free.  Thankfully Matt and others came to the rescue then and convinced the community this was allowed.  This was all 2008-2010 ish.\n\nThen people started taking those Pro plugins and reselling them as-is.  Wait a second, that's my hard work, how can they do that?  Once again, people said \"hey, it's GPL, we can do as I want\".  That's when everyone discovered the magic of trademarks.  Matt did a few presentations talking about that, and lots of Pro plugin and theme authors started acquiring the trademarks for their products.  It didn't stop someone from using your code, but it did stop them from using the name to market it.\n\nNow what appears to be happening is an overreach of using trademarks and shaming as a way to get competitors to disappear.  Basically it seems like a shakedown is starting to occur where anybody using the name WordPress, even in a product description, is in the crosshairs.  It seems that the 5% time hasn't been a huge success, so they are trying to forcibly extract it from companies under the pretense of paying an ongoing licensing fee to use WordPress as your product description, even though that's allowed under basically fair use.  \n\nMatt opened pandora's box with his keynote, but he doesn't seem to appreciate what he's done yet.  Almost every old time WordPress person I've talked to (some of which had top 5 plugins) are in agreement that he's basically pulling the temple down on his own head at this point.\n\n### Comment ID lot1k02 with +3 score by [(ikefalcon, Reddit, 2024-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lot1k02/) (in reply to ID lormn7q):\nThat, and if the trademarks are not enforced then they will be lost and using the trademark will be considered fair use.\n\n## Comment ID lorpspz with +2 score by [(azunaki, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lorpspz/) (in reply to ID 1fol35p):\nYikes\n\n## Comment ID loukyxp with +1 score by [(Oli_Picard, Reddit, 2024-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/loukyxp/) (in reply to ID 1fol35p):\nVery glad I decided to jump over to the JAM stack and build sites static now.

Our users are reporting that external recipients are getting blank emails when viewed in the native Mail app on iOS (Apple Mail). No other email client seems to be having this problem, as far as we can tell. I believe this has to do with using an embedded image in an Exclaimer template. I removed our firm's logo and this seemed to \"fix\" the emails from showing up blank.\n\nHowever, I think there is much more going on... Attaching an email (.EML file) and sending it externally would essentially replace the content of the attached email with the content from the sent email.

I did it according to the video (that is btw unlisted on YouTube, and no guide on this on their site, so if you don't have it open or in your YT history, there's no way to get to it because the reset promt / screen won't let you check the DMs inside of the app :)), but the charger kept blinking white, and no green sensor light as described. After several minutes charger started to shine purple, at that point I took the ring off the charger, app said factory reset done, but the ring auto conencted to the app, so it probably didn't get done correctly\n\n#### Comment ID lirrmrd with +1 score by [(deedub1, Reddit, 2024-08-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultrahuman/comments/1ev0ne7/someone_at_ultrahuman_really_need_to_check_their/lirrmrd/) (in reply to ID liqnd9y):\nThis is exactly what happened to me today. After a huge drop in battery after the firmware update, an email to support and a reply to do a factory reset. Ya, no green led, After the reset it reconnected immediately so I believe it didn’t reset. It’s now been 1.5 hours on the charger and it’s only added 23% (50% to 73%).

Got the air ring 10 days ago. Traveled with it. Discovered my battery doesn’t last 3 days. I’ve had to charge it 4 times in 10 days. Also got the M1, managed to screw up application of the sensor so synced the UH app to an abbot freestyle libre 2 sensor and subscribed to the UH monthly CGM lite program. When my first sensor expired, I applied a new one and synced with the app. However the app refuses to recognize it now and won’t let me scan it. So I have to scan in the librelink app. The whole UH ecosystem unfortunately isn’t working properly. The app is clunky and the ring whilst promising just can’t work if the battery life is going to be this poor. My Apple Watch Ultra lasts 1.5 to 2 days.\n\n## Comment ID litu76b with +1 score by [(Jennes74, Reddit, 2024-08-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultrahuman/comments/1ev0ne7/someone_at_ultrahuman_really_need_to_check_their/litu76b/) (in reply to ID 1ev0ne7):\nFacing the same thing for the last two days. Almost 4+ days with a complete charge. Yesterday during the day, I could literally watch the percentage drain.

Are you using the new subscription based power plugs? I was using the cardio adaptability plug.\n\n2. the new firmware must have made the sensors activate not only at night for this powerplug and instead more than just when you are sleeping (this drains battery more).\n\nI removed my subscription and when it was not active anymore (the cardio adaptability powerplug), I also reinstalled the Ultrahuman app as it stopped functioning as well and not connecting with the ring. After charging the ring to 100pct last night, my battery drain is now 5pct in 6 hours 20min.

One of the most amazing things I found there was classifying SKUs in all kinds of photos where even it was hard for manual identification. With the cooperation work with different groups, the final results were really impressive. I was really glad to have the chance to do an intern there.\r\n1. Really really good mentorship!!!\r\n2. Challenging work of classification and a great sense of achievement after getting good accuracy.\r\n3. The office atmosphere is both relaxing and busy. During the lunch break, everyone was relaxed and talked about different interesting things. In work time, everyone was working hard.",

      "# [Inspecting Inside and Out for Blade Hazards by Rogers Weed on 2024-05-15](https://www.nacleanenergy.com/wind/inspecting-inside-and-out-for-blade-hazards)\nImage data from visual inspections is nearly always the starting point for planning a blade maintenance campaign. Historically, external visual inspections of the outside of the blades have been the dominant dataset because they are less expensive to collect; no one needs to climb the tower to gather images of the blades. Ground-based cameras were initially employed, which then gave way to drones and automation that increased both the quality of images and the efficiency of collecting those images.\n\nRecently, however, we have seen a significant increase in requests for internal blade inspections, despite the extra cost involved in collection. Why the recent increase? What types of problems does each inspection type detect? How should customers think about using them in managing their fleet?\n\nInternal inspections come in more shapes and sizes because the process already involves sending people up the tower. Some are done entirely manually by having the technician crawl into the blade with a flashlight and a camera. Others involve using manually operated robots (including drones) to assist in data collection. Internal inspections often go beyond visually documenting the inside of the blade, and include tasks like checking the lightning protection system cables and doing tapping or other non-destructive testing on suspicious spots inside the blade.\n\nWhat problems is each process useful for detecting? Erosion of the leading edge is an easy one, as this problem starts from the outside of the blade and works its way in; an external visual inspection is the obvious choice for identifying these problems. Similarly, lightning strikes generally happen near the tip of the blade where getting an internal view can be nearly impossible. Since the outside of the blade features receptors that can be visually inspected for damage, an external visual inspection is generally the first tool for detecting lightning strikes (a test of the lightning protection system, or LPS, is another valuable diagnostic). Laminate cracks, however, are a crossover problem. While they can be spotted from either an external inspection or an internal one, cracks on the inside can often be detected sooner since the surfaces are not painted, and early laminate stress can be seen in the form of whitish areas.\n\nInternal inspections are where most structural problems will be best assessed. Large stress cracks will show up in the laminate and can corroborate things seen from the outside. Bond line failures around the sheer webs and spar caps, as well as any problems with the root structure (connecting root bolts, etc.) are identified through an internal inspection. The LPS down conductor cable is also accessible from inside the blade, and sometimes there is obvious visual damage related to lightning flash overs from the laminate.\n\nA few final observations before moving to suggestions on using these tools: Most of the structural problems detected from the inside will require expensive repairs, so the earlier they are detected, the better. Problems like laminate cracks are usually visible from the inside before they can be seen on the outside. External inspections can be enhanced using thermal sensing to reveal problems in bond lines, but managing the heat source is tricky so reliable results can be tough to produce.\n\nHow, then, to decide on using these tools? Cost is certainly a major factor – internal inspections can be five times more expensive per wind turbine than external inspections. If the assets are approaching the end of their warranty period, an external inspection can be a cost-effective way to document their condition at transfer. If the blade models on site are known to have structural problems, internal inspections will be much better at detecting those and, as mentioned before, the earlier those are detected the better. If previous external inspections have revealed cracks in the exterior of the blades, those should all be further investigated via internal inspections. Collecting accurate distance-to-the-root information will allow an internal inspection to provide further insight into suspicious cracks seen from the outside.\n\nAt the end of the day, what’s most important is adopting a data-driven approach to getting the most from a finite blade maintenance budget. High-quality data consistently collected is the cornerstone of this approach. For visual inspections, image resolution, lighting, and focus, and accurate measurements of defect size and location from the root of the blade can be the difference between a maintenance campaign that accomplishes its objectives on time and budget, and one that rapidly falls behind when repair teams discover something unexpected when they arrive to do their work.\n\nRogers Weed is a Managing Director for the Clobotics Wind Services Americas Region.

      "# [The AI Sector in China. Much Smaller Than the US, Similar in Size to the UK. — Glass.AI by Sergi Martorell on 2023-09-06](https://www.glass.ai/glass-news/mapping-the-ai-sector-in-china-much-smaller-than-the-us-and-similar-in-size-to-thenbspuk)\nIntroduction\n\nThe UK is preparing to host the first global AI summit, but it’s unclear if China will attend or be invited. This is partly due to the fact that there is an AI arms race going on between the West (especially the United States) and China, and we are only in the early stages.\n\nThere are many ways to measure this technological race and the size of the respective AI sectors. Leading publications have provided some data, for example, a Nikkei study argued that China is far surpassing the U.S. in both quantity and quality of AI-related papers, with Tencent, Alibaba and Huawei among the top 10 companies producing AI research. China also seems to lead in AI patent filings, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and several papers.\n\nThat said, the United States leads in terms of investment, and we know that US firms invested billions into the Chinese AI sector (before restrictions were imposed). Below is some data published by Bloomberg recently:\n\nThe US also kickstarted the Generative AI revolution, a fundamental technological shift. The success of ChatGPT accelerated the ongoing race for AI supremacy not only among the tech giants but also between countries. China recently published new rules for generative AI, becoming one of the first countries in the world to regulate this new technology.\n\nIt’s an open race that will continue over the coming years across many dimensions. Some argue that China will win because of its talent, growing technological skill and innovation, and national investment in science and technology. Others point out that while China has caught up with impressive speed, the conditions that allowed it to do so will likely also prevent it from taking a meaningful lead in the AI race.\n\nUnfortunately in this debate, there is limited data about the AI sector in China beyond the tech giants and the data on academic publications and patents. In this article, we aim to contribute to the debate by providing data and evidence about the companies in the AI sector in China. We have previously researched hundreds of emerging technology sectors globally, including the AI sectors of the United States and the United Kingdom. It wasn’t easy to replicate this for China but we’ve built techniques that have allowed us to crawl the Chinese ‘open’ web. Here is what we found.\n\nMethodology\n\nglass.ai is an AI research capability that reads the web to discover, understand and track the activities of companies. Since 2022, we’ve been tracking companies on a global scale, including companies in China that have a web presence and content in Standard Chinese, the modern standardized form of Mandarin Chinese.\n\nTo identify the AI companies in China and gather details about their products and services, we used our capability to crawl the Chinese web, that is, millions of company websites, news sources, social media, sector-specific sites and other sources. Our AI read content in Chinese and also gathered any evidence that appeared in English. For reference, below are the main sources our AI reads to discover and track companies globally:\n\nHow did we determine if the companies are based in China?\n\nWe have an ongoing discovery process that reads websites across different country domains and classifies the sites as company websites if it detects certain criteria around content (e.g. active, in Chinese/English, business content) and if possible, will predict the sector and geography of the business (e.g. an address in China). This, combined with any addresses mentioned on social sites and news sources, gives us extra validation about the location of the companies. The AI can also gather evidence on foreign AI companies with significant presence/activity in a particular country. This is how we mapped a large part of the Chinese economy based on its web presence and then identified the AI companies. In this particular piece, we focused on AI companies that are headquartered in China.\n\nHow did we identify Chinese AI companies?\n\nAt the start of the research, we used a list of 100+ semantically related AI categories, topics/keywords, phrases and other criteria that define the boundaries of the AI sector. At glass.ai, we have completed various research projects that have mapped the AI sectors of different countries. As a result, we already have a well-defined taxonomy that has been used in recent studies to discover companies that focus on AI. For the research on China, we didn’t want to reinvent the wheel, therefore we applied the same taxonomy to identify Chinese AI firms. The long list of AI topics/phrases was translated from English to Chinese.\n\nBelow are the main high-level categories:\n\nOur next step involved deep-reading a total of 6m+ Chinese company websites to identify any text that suggested the companies develop AI products or services. To ensure more complete coverage, we augmented the results with other data sources like news, social media, and sector-specific sources. We also leveraged previous studies and papers that have looked into the AI ecosystem to train and fine-tune our language models.\n\nSize of the AI Sector in China\n\nOur research capability was able to identify a total of 3,373 AI companies in China across sectors, AI categories and geographies. This includes both private and public-listed companies. It’s important to caveat that the Chinese ‘public web’ is less open than in other countries. This comes with some challenges but we are confident that our results are a good proxy of the size of the Chinese AI sector.\n\nThe crawler picked up the top tech companies in China (Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba, ByteDance, Huawei, JD.com and Xiaomi) as they are actively applying AI technologies, and some have launched large language models (LLMs) recently. It also identified the top AI companies in China like Mobvoi, Rokid, Megvii, CloudWalk, SenseTime, Hikvision and others. But more importantly, it managed to uncover several thousand Chinese AI companies that have never been mentioned in any previous research.

      "# [Products, Competitors, Financials, Employees, Headquarters Locations](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/linevision)\nFrom Resistance to Resilience: Change Management for First-timers in Digital Transformation\n\nToo Long; Didn't Read This article highlights the critical role of change management in digital transformation through Kotter’s 8-Step Model. By addressing workflow dependencies, simulating real-life processes in early hands-on testing, and implementing iterative rollouts across departments, product lines, and geographies, organizations can tackle resistance, enhance adoption, and align systems with strategic operational goals. In my previous article , I discussed the role of data translators in bridging the communication gap between the business and the technology teams by turning complex data analysis into actionable insights that drive enterprise success. While data translators hold the power to unlock the potential of advanced technology, translating data is only part of the equation. For these data insights to drive real business impact, they must inspire action, which demands a shift in how people across the business work. From my own experience, even the best technology or insights fail to reach their potential without a deliberate approach to change management. The greatest challenge in digital transformation is often less about the technology and more about transforming operating models, mindsets, and behaviors to create meaningful, lasting impact. Without change management, digital transformation is just an unfulfilled promise. Why Digital Transformation Can’t Take Place Without Change Management Digital transformation is often framed as a technological challenge, though it’s ultimately a human one. For organizations that are used to living by manual processes and siloed workflows, introducing automation and digital tools can feel disruptive. Resistance isn’t the enemy but rather a sign for a deeper need for change. Having led the rollout of a digital system for the end-to-end trading card production at our company, I realized that the true measure of success wasn’t the technology advancement but the adoption, usage, and organizational impact inherited from this technology. It is undeniable that change management is key to evolving our legacy systems into modern, efficient processes that enhance operational efficiency and drive greater profitability across all our business teams. At our company, the production process relies on offline documents and manual processes as the primary source of truth. There is no centralized system to track key product statuses or timelines and manual workflows frequently prolong review cycles, increase errors, and hinder our scalability. To address these inefficiencies, we built a modern digital system to centralize product data, improve visibility into development progress, streamline production workflows, and reduce repetitive tasks. However, transitioning from a decade-long legacy system requires more than just a technological upgrade. It demands effective change management to reimagine outdated processes and overcome cultural resistance. How Our Change Management Strategies Overcame Legacy Challenges To navigate this change, I helped establish a change management initiative rooted in Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model . By cultivating a sense of urgency, empowering cross-functional collaboration, and fostering incremental adoption, I led the team in uprooting deeply rooted habits to open up to novel changes: Addressing Cross-Team Systems and Workflow Interdependencies Drawing from Step 5: Empowering Broad-Based Action in Kotter’s model, we designed testing to mirror real-life workflow interactions across various teams, which addresses critical touchpoints that enable task hands-offs from one team to another. For example, the Project Management team relies on inputs from Product Development, Design, and Finance teams to track the status of tasks across product groups, subsets, and cards. Failing to account for these linkages in our new workflow would hinder the system's potential, risking status delays and workflow disruptions that hinder the new tool from realizing its full benefits. As such, we designed our testing programs to ensure the new system could integrate data and processes from one group to another. We included end-to-end testing of key milestones, validation of data integrity across workstreams, and iterative feedback loops to refine these functionalities. By involving representatives from each team, we ensured the system supported collaborative workflows and addressed real-world challenges, thereby driving alignment and operational efficiency comprehensively. We carefully selected pilot products and projects to span different stages and components of the workflow, helping stakeholders understand how their roles influenced the broader processes. For example, the same products were chosen for testing across various teams to ensure that output from one team correctly flowed into the next as input. This approach allowed the refinement of workflows and addressed gaps proactively, ensuring that the new system accounts for the end-to-end production process instead of one isolated step. We designed user guides and demo videos to emphasize cross-workflow features such as real-time updates, automated notifications, and conflict alerts. These materials incorporated feedback from pilot testing and showcased practical scenarios, helping teams visualize how the new system could improve their daily tasks. By focusing on these features and their tangible benefits, we fostered a sense of shared ownership and underscored the importance of cross-team functionality in letting the new technology drive the new system. Ford addressed siloed operations by leveraging strategic research, ethnographies, and cultural anthropology to create cross-functional and diverse workflows that strengthened connections between design, engineering, and manufacturing teams. This strategy enabled Ford to align around the customer, adopt innovative ways of working, make strategic decisions, and foster continuous innovation, ultimately achieving remarkable success with the launch of the new F-150. Making Testing “Real” Through Hands-On Practice Building on Step 6: Generating Short-Term Wins in Kotter’s model, we prioritized early hands-on practice to build momentum for broader adoption. Through a multi-phase pilot program, teams had the opportunity to engage with the new system in real time and test a comprehensive range of use cases to proactively address challenges that could arise post-adoption. Each phase simulated different edge cases that occur during the end-to-end production process, such as product change request submissions post-planning or updates in product designs that affect downstream printing. This enabled teams to experience how the new workflow operated in realistic scenarios and build confidence in the system’s capabilities. For example, during testing, we discovered bottlenecks in creating various scenarios of scheduling projections. To address this, we introduced calculated fields for task scheduling to ensure better accuracy. This approach enhanced user confidence by allowing users to create accurate projections of different operational scenarios that allow them to anticipate and act on a range of outcomes. By allowing teams to practice in a low-pressure environment, we were able to identify areas for improvement in the process and allow teams to become accustomed to both the new system and workflow, thereby reducing resistance and enhancing adoption. Feedback loops after every phase further helped us align the system with team needs, thereby reinforcing trust and adoption in business users. Case study example: A notable example of a company employing a multi-phase pilot program to assess system readiness and build early enhancements to facilitate wider adoption is Avangrid, Inc. In August 2023, Avangrid initiated a pilot project with LineVision, Inc. to enhance grid capacity in New York State. Avangrid piloted LineVision's Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) technology on select transmission lines in New York to evaluate its performance in real-world conditions. This approach enabled them to test the system's reliability and incorporate feedback from engineers and grid operators to resolve data integration bottlenecks with their existing grid management systems. Early solutions included developing middleware for seamless data flow, implementing real-time monitoring dashboards to highlight system discrepancies, and automating data mapping and validation to minimize manual errors. By resolving these issues early, they ensured a smoother and more effective full-scale rollout. Ensuring a Smooth Transition with Phased Rollout Following Step 7: Consolidating Gains and Producing More Change in Kotter’s model, we took an iterative approach to the system rollout, building on early successes and refining the processes across various stages. We began with launching the system across North American products, then gradually expanded to the full suite of international products and selected card licenses for building based on business value and technical feasibility. The order in which these card licenses were built was prioritized based on their revenue size, ease of data integration for card athletes’ information, and production complexity. We started with high-revenue team sports before moving to individual sports which comprised a smaller portion of the product portfolio and required more technical configuration. This phased approach minimized workflow disruption gave teams time to adapt to the new tool and workflow, and allowed us to address challenges in real time. More importantly, it enabled a comprehensive and forward-looking rollout plan across all card licenses and regional product lines by prioritizing the feasibility of building products based on existing features and the available bandwidth of the new system. This approach allowed for strategic planning of features and workload capabilities for future system versions.",

This method of inspection can be dangerous for the personnel involved, and the resulting downtime can be expensive. Wind turbine inspection can be performed using autonomous drones to achieve lower downtime, cost, and health risks. To enable autonomy, the field of drone path planning can be assisted by this research, namely machine learning that detects wind turbines present in aerial RGB images taken by the drone before performing the maneuvering for turbine inspection. For this task, the effectiveness of two deep learning architectures is evaluated in this paper both without and with a proposed fuzzy contrast enhancement (FCE) image preprocessing algorithm. Efforts are focused on two convolutional neural network (CNN) variants: VGG19 and Xception. A more traditional approach involving support vector machines (SVM) is also included to contrast a machine learning approach with our deep learning networks. The authors created a novel dataset of 4500 RGB images of size 210 × 210 to train and evaluate the performance of these networks on wind turbine detection. The dataset is captured in an environment mimicking that of a wind turbine farm, and consists of two classes of images: with and without a small-scale wind turbine (12V Primus Air Max) assembled at Utah Valley University. The images were used to describe in detail the analysis and implementation of the VGG19, Xception, and SVM algorithms using different optimization, model training, and hyperparameter tuning technologies. The performances of these three algorithms are compared in depth alongside those augmented using the proposed FCE image preprocessing technique.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nIn recent years, the demand for renewable energy generated from wind power has increased rapidly. The year 2021 reflects this as wind’s second-best year of growth despite pandemic conditions disrupting the industry and introducing supply chain problems [1].\n\nWind turbines used to harness wind power can be damaged and degraded by their environments [2,3,4,5]. When the blades of wind turbines fail, the effects can be disruptive by leading to a long-term shutdown of operations. Wind turbine blades were found to cause over 5% of wind turbine failures in a study that surveyed more than 1500 wind turbines for fifteen years [6]. These failures can result in wind turbine downtime over ten days [7]. Continuous condition monitoring of wind turbines can remediate such issues before a wind turbine failure occurs.\n\nTraditionally, rope teams manually inspect wind turbines for possible damages such as cracks on the blades [8]. This includes certified professionals from organizations such as the Industrial Rope Access Trade Association (IRATA) and the Society of Professional Rope Access Technicians (SPRAT) [9,10]. However, conditions surrounding wind turbines could be dangerous to personnel, providing hurdles for wind energy maintenance, and potentially increasing the cost. Additionally, in-person inspection requires turbine shutdown, resulting in higher downtime. Consequently, alternative methods of inspecting wind turbines are of great interest: the market is quickly turning towards unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and drones for inspecting wind turbines [8,11]. Organizations such as Clobotics and Arthwind are pioneering work in this field [12,13]. Similar interest is seen in academia [14,15,16,17]. One issue that still needs to be solved with the adoption of drone inspection is presenting the data acquired from drones in a way that is understandable to the engineers performing maintenance [11]. To mitigate this problem, a system needs to be developed to allow the drones to act autonomously and preferably respond with a single output indicating whether a wind turbine requires maintenance or not.\n\nAn initial key aspect of this type of autonomous drone inspection is its ability to accurately identify the presence of wind turbines in the field. Machine learning has been proven to be a powerful tool for classifying objects in images [18]. A classical approach to machine learning involves the use of support vector machines (SVMs). Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are also extensions of the branch of machine learning known as neural networks (NNs), and are particularly adept at classifying images, making them instrumental to the task of identifying wind turbines [19,20].\n\nSimilar to NNs, CNNs are composed of node layers acting as a linear regression model followed by a nonlinear activation function that prevents them from collapsing into a single linear model and allows the network to represent more complicated relationships. CNNs are composed primarily of three node layers: convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected (FC) layers.\n\nIn an effort to improve the performance of autonomous wind turbine inspection, this paper analyzes and compares the effects of applying fuzzy contrast enhancement (FCE) to three machine learning methods trained on the preliminary stage of wind turbine inspection: classifying whether RGB images contain wind turbines. If FCE successfully improves the performance of wind turbine detection, it may be evaluated in future research to improve the performance of other stages of wind turbine inspection as well, such as through the enhancement of defects in images of wind turbine blades. Fuzzification is used in an attempt to make the wind turbines more noticeable in the RGB aerial images via FCE preprocessing. This can potentially be manipulated to further increase accuracy in all the tested machine learning methods. The machine learning algorithms explored are the visual geometry group model 19 (VGG19), Xception, and SVM. The VGG19 and Xception architectures were selected to represent the state of the art for evaluation of FCE. SVM is a lightweight machine learning approach; it was selected to evaluate the performance of FCE on an algorithm that requires fewer computational resources. To our knowledge, FCE has not been applied to Xception previously. It has been applied to VGG16, a precursor to VGG19 [21,22]. However, we found no instances where it has been applied to VGG19 through our research. FCE has previously been applied to SVM, so the performance of this algorithm is included here as a baseline for comparison with the VGG19 and Xception deep learning algorithms [21].\n\nAn overview of our approach to training and testing the machine learning (ML) algorithms adopted in this study is summarized in Figure 1. A dataset of 4500 aerial RGB images was captured by a DJI Matrice 300 RTK drone with Zenmuse L1 RGB camera at Utah Valley University (UVU). The images were used to train the three network architectures: the SVM machine learning approach and the VGG19 and Xception deep learning approaches. The hyperparameters within these networks were tuned, and the effects of applying the proposed FCE algorithm were explored by implementing fifteen case studies: A1–A5, B1–B6, and C1–C4. For each architecture, the first corresponding case studies found the set of hyperparameters that performed best for that architecture. Afterwards, the proposed FCE was applied to each architecture tuned with the corresponding best performing set of hyperparameters. The best results from each network architecture were then compared to determine the most suitable method for wind turbine recognition in RGB images. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\nImplementation of the proposed fuzzy contrast enhancement (FCE) image preprocessing step for VGG19, Xception and SVM algorithms. Additionally, the performances of all algorithms without and with the proposed FCE were analyzed and compared.\n\nCreation of a novel RGB dataset of 4500 aerial images from a Primus Air Max small wind turbine mimicking the environment of a wind turbine farm using a small-scale wind turbine prototype to compare the performance of the three ML algorithms.\n\nDetailed analyses and implementation of the VGG19, Xception, and SVM algorithms using different optimization methods, model training, and hyperparameter tuning technologies.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: The architectures of the VGG19, Xception, and SVM networks are described in Section 2 and Section 3. The fuzzy contrast enhancement is detailed in Section 4. The formulation and process of hyperparameter tuning, including categories, batch size, loss function, and dropout, are presented in Section 5. The generated dataset of 4500 RGB images and experimental results of the fifteen case studies are presented in Section 6. The last section summarizes the findings, followed by suggestions for future work.\n\n2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n\nCNNs are a type of neural network that is particularly well-suited for image classification and recognition tasks. They are composed of one or more convolutional layers, which perform the convolution operation on the input data. An example of this transformation is shown in Figure 2. In this operation, a kernel is slid along the input layer, computing the elementwise product between the kernel and each portion of the input layer. The sum of these products is then arranged in a new 2-D array of weights known as the feature map, which is the output of the convolution layer [20].\n\nCNNs use pooling layers to reduce the size of the input data. This reduces the complexity and increases the efficiency of the neural network. Another feature commonly used in CNNs is the fully connected (FC) layer. As the name suggests, this layer maps every input node to every output node. The final layer in a CNN is typically an FC layer, as this layer can make connections between all of the data at the end of the network and the final network output. This enables the final nodes in the CNN to contain the likelihood that the input image belongs to each class [19]. The CNN architectures used in this research, both VGG19 and Xception, were created and trained using the Keras software package available for the Python programming language [23].\n\n2.1. VGG19\n\nOne of the architectures explored in this paper focuses on transfer learning built on a VGG network, a fundamental yet renowned machine learning algorithm introduced by Andrew Zisserman and Karen Simonyan [24]. In order to maneuver large-scale pictures, the VGG model analyzes the depth of layers using a relatively small convolutional filter size ( 3 × 3 ) [25]. The pretrained visual geometry group model 19 (VGG19) was trained on the ImageNet database of more than a million images from 1000 classes. All database images were RGB of size 224 × 224 pixels [26].\n\nThe first 16 layers of VGG19 are convolution layers and the last 3 layers are dense (fully connected) layers [26]. Five blocks of convolution are present in VGG19. Each block goes along with one MaxPool Layer. Block 1: The depth of filters is 64 with two convolution layers. Block 2: The depth of filters is 128, with two convolution layers. Block 3: The depth of filters is 256, with four convolution layers. Block 4 and Block 5: The depth of filters is 512, with four convolution layers [27]. The architecture of the model is summarized in detail in Table 1.\n\nThere are three potential approaches for the application of transfer learning on VGG19. The first approach runs the convolution base on an image dataset, recording its output to a Numpy array on the disk storage and then using this data as input to a densely-connected classifier. This solution is fast and computationally inexpensive to execute as it only requires running the convolution base once for each input image. The second approach runs the whole model front-to-end every time the image passes through the convolution base prior to reaching the dense layer. This increases accuracy at the cost of speed. This is the most widely used approach since it balances between the model performance and speed. The third approach is fine-tuning, which consists of unfreezing a few of the top layers of a model base used for feature extraction and simultaneously training both the fully connected classifier and these top layers. This method is computationally costly but suitable when the training images are quite different from the those in the ImageNet database [27].\n\nVGG19 is useful because it is a CNN with an uncomplicated structure that is effective at image classification. It is therefore suitable for wind turbine classification, and this paper includes an emphasis on the VGG19 model as one of the three methods to classify wind turbines in the RGB image dataset created at UVU and to evaluate the FCE algorithm.\n\n2.2. Xception\n\nThe Xception architecture is a CNN evolved from Inception, a similar class of CNN originally presented in [28]. The first variant of Inception, Inception-v1, replaces the traditional convolution layer with the Inception module, a collection of multiple convolution operations of varying kernel sizes. The Inception architecture was subsequently refined (Inception-v2) and followed by Inception-v3. Inception-v2 integrates batch normalization within the model’s architecture [29]. Inception-v3 modifies the convolution kernel to increase the architecture’s computational efficiency [30].\n\nIn [31], the author recognized that the Inception module factors the traditional CNN convolution layer into components that separately perform spatial and cross-channel correlations. Therefore, they presented the hypothesis that spatial and cross-channel correlations can be entirely separated. The result was named Xception, short for Extreme Inception, which replaces the Inception module with depthwise separable convolution layers known as Xception modules. Xception outperformed Inception-v3 on both datasets that were tested [31].\n\nThe Xception network architecture has been implemented for a variety of applications, including microcrack detection on solar panels from electroluminescence images [32], identification of medicinal plants from RGB images [33], and detection of faces created by a generative adversarial network [34]. Additionally, the Xception module has been implemented independently of the Xception network, such as in [35], which used the Xception module in a modified version of the U-Net CNN network architecture to extract buildings from high-resolution remote sensing images.\n\nXception differs from VGG19 due to the Xception module and residual connections that it implements, where data are passed directly from earlier layers in the architecture to later layers by bypassing intermediate layers. These attributes tend to increase the accuracy of the model, which increases its suitability for wind turbine classification, at the cost of computational complexity. As such, the Xception architecture was selected to evaluate the performance of FCE on a complex, nonlinear architecture. The structure of the Xception network architecture used in the case studies presented in this paper, which was abbreviated from the version of the Xception architecture in [31], is illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n\nSupport vector machines have emerged as a well-established and widely-used machine learning algorithm for solving classification and regression problems. While they may not be as novel or as performant as techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or other advanced machine learning algorithms, SVMs still offer several advantages that make them a reasonable option, particularly in scenarios where computational efficiency and interpretability are important [36].\n\nAt the core of SVMs lies the principle of margin maximization, which aims to find a decision boundary that maximally separates different classes. By identifying the hyperplane with the largest possible margin between the nearest data points of different classes, SVMs exhibit good generalization performance. This makes them suitable for applications where robust classification is desired, even in the presence of noisy or overlapping data [37].\n\nOne of the key advantages of SVMs is their ability to handle nonlinear classification tasks. By employing kernel functions, such as the linear, polynomial, or radial basis function (RBF) kernels, SVMs can implicitly map the data into a higher-dimensional feature space where linear separation becomes possible [38]. This “kernel trick” eliminates the need to explicitly compute the transformed feature space, making SVMs computationally lighter compared to explicit feature mapping approaches. Furthermore, SVMs offer interpretability, which is a valuable characteristic in domains where model transparency and clarity are essential [39]. The trained SVM models provide insights into the decision-making process, allowing users to understand and interpret the factors influencing the classification outcome. This interpretability can be crucial in domains such as healthcare, finance, legal applications, or, in this case, environmental science, where accountability and trust are essential.\n\nAnother advantage of SVMs is their robustness to overfitting, provided that appropriate regularization techniques are employed. SVMs inherently seek to find the decision boundary with the largest margin, which promotes a balance between model complexity and generalization ability. This makes SVMs less prone to overfitting compared to more complex models [40].\n\nIn addition, SVMs offer computational efficiency compared to more computationally demanding techniques like deep neural networks. This computational efficiency makes SVMs suitable for situations with limited computational resources and/or real-time processing requirements such as automated real-time detection of wind turbines in RGB images captured by drones discussed in this paper. SVM was therefore selected for evaluation of FCE preprocessing on a lightweight, computationally inexpensive architecture. However, it is anticipated that SVM will not perform as well as the selected deep learning architectures due to the limitations inherent in SVM’s low-complexity design. SVM was implemented using the SVM architecture available through the scikit-learn package for Python [41].\n\n4. Proposed Image Preprocessing with Fuzzy Contrast Enhancement (FCE)\n\nPreprocessing of a dataset when performing artificial intelligence (AI) tasks can ensure data fidelity and continuity. In this section, we implement a preprocessing step to improve the quality and contrast of the created dataset (Section 6.1) before executing the AI algorithms. It is anticipated that the proposed fuzzy contrast enhancement (FCE) preprocessing step will improve the quality of the dataset by increasing the contrast of the images such that machine learning architectures will be able to more easily identify the features differentiating the classes of images in the dataset, leading to higher classification accuracy. To perform FCE, the RGB images were first transformed to the CIELAB color space, and then their intensity component was amplified using fuzzy logic. Conversion to and from the CIELAB color space was accomplished using the OpenCV package available for Python [42]. Amplification of the images’ intensity components was performed through custom software using the Python language and the NumPy package available for Python [43].\n\n4.1. CIELAB Color Space\n\nCIELAB is a three-dimensional device-independent color space model that represents the entire range of human photopic (daylight) vision. It is known to better mimic human vision which helps to identify small differences in color, and alter and isolate specific channels of the image. In an RGB image, the three present channels are red, green, and blue; thus, changing one of these three values will change the overall appearance of the image, but only based on color. In contrast, CIELAB color space has different channels that not only involve the color but also the intensity/lightness of an image.\n\nThe CIELAB color space was built from three channels that are perpendicular to one another. The a*, b*, and L* channels are relative to colors green to red, blue to yellow, and black to white, respectively [44]. The L* channel represents pixel intensity and closely matches human perception of lightness or achromatic colors, the shades of grey. For example, L* = 0 and L* = 1 denote pure black and white, respectively. Each color is represented by a color point (L*, a*, b*) in the color space [44]. CIELAB color space is selected because it is useful for detecting and predicting small differences in color of the images.\n\n4.2. Fuzzification of Image Pixel Intensity\n\nFuzzy logic refers to the generalization of a real number, which is a fuzzy number. It introduces a connected set of possible values, where each value has a weight between 0 and 1. Therefore, it is possible to use fuzzy numbers in the area between two values so that a certain classification or result is not rigidly bound to either one of the two values. In this paper, fuzzy logic is selected for contrast enhancement due to its simplicity and robust outcomes, particularly in classification problems, where values exhibit confidence intervals.\n\nTo perform FCE, fuzzy logic rules were used to amplify channel L* (pixel intensity) with a value of 0 being black and 255 being pure white. After isolating the L* channel in the CIELAB color space, the image undergoes fuzzification using the specified fuzzy rule set [21,45]. This rule set is comprised of a predefined inventory of interval values in which the L* of each pixel is categorized. Gaussian membership functions were used to establish these intervals using if-then rules. The functions vary according to each set of intervals defined for the L* value of the pixel. In this setting, each of the intervals get a classification title: “Extremely Dark (ED)”, “Very Dark (VD)”, “Dark (Da)”, “Slightly Dark (SD)”, “Slightly Bright (SB)”, “Bright (Br)”, “Very Bright (VB)”, and “Extremely Bright (EB)” (see Figure 4). While the intervals for each of these classifications are different, the base equation is the same, a Gaussian function is given by (1)\n\nμ ( x ; μ , s ) = e x p ( − 1 2 ( x − μ s ) 2 )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x is the pixel value, μ or ‘M’ is the mean (the average pixel value of the given image) and s is the standard deviation of pixel values in the given image. Figure 4 shows the fuzzy membership functions for μ = 128 .\n\nAfter assigning the new classification to the pixel, the proposed fuzzy rule set becomes operational (Figure 5). The execution involves utilizing fuzzy rules for elevating all classifications by one level to achieve contrast enhancement (Algorithm 1, [45]). For example, if a pixel receives a classification of “Very Dark (VD)” then according to our fuzzy rule set, the new fuzzified classification would be “Extremely Dark (ED)”, and so on. This rule set eliminates any “Slightly Bright (SB)” or “Slightly Dark (SD)” classifications. By applying Algorithm 1 to images of wind turbines, these contrast modifications will be applied as defined by the if-then rules. This will lead to contrast enhancement in the images, where an increase in the overall accuracy of the ML architectures is anticipated. A visualization of images processed with this FCE algorithm is given in Figure 6, and results indicating the effectiveness of FCE are presented in Section 7 as well as Table 2 and Table 3 and Figure 7 and Figure 8.\n\nAlgorithm 1 Fuzzy Logic-Based Image Contrast EnhancementInput: Aerial RGB image\n\nOutput: Aerial RGB image with fuzzy contrast enhancement\n\n1:\n\nConvert input image from RGB to CIELAB color space and calculate the average pixel intensity ( μ ) of the image\n\n2:\n\nFuzzification: For each pixel, calculate degree of membership of each class based on pixel intensity and μ value; intensity ∈ [ 0 , 255 ]\n\n3:\n\nInference: Calculate the output fuzzy set from the input pixel intensity based on the following rule set:\n\nIf input is “Very Dark (VD)” then output is “Extremely Dark (ED)”\n\nIf input is “Dark (Da)” then output is “Very Dark (VD)”\n\nIf input is “Slightly Dark (SD)” then output is “Dark (Da)”\n\nIf input is “Slightly Bright (SB)” then output is “Bright (Br)”\n\nIf input is “Bright (Br)” then output is “Very Bright (VB)”\n\nIf input is “Very Bright (VB)” then output is “Extremely Bright (EB)”.\n\n4:\n\nDefuzzification: For each pixel, calculate the centroid value of its output fuzzy set; centroid ∈ [ − 50 , 305 ]\n\n5:\n\nNormalize output pixel intensity from [ − 50 , 305 ] to [ 0 , 255 ]\n\n6:\n\nMerge modified L* channel to the original a*b* channels\n\n7:\n\nConvert output image from CIELAB color space to RGB\n\n5. Hyperparameter Tuning\n\nThe three ML approaches used in this research (VGG19, Xception, and SVM) were further tweaked to tune the network architectures for the detection of wind turbines through the selection of hyperparameters: parameters of a network that can be modified before training to improve model performance [46]. As the number of hyperparameters can increase significantly, the process of determining the ideal hyperparameters for the network becomes computationally expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, a method of determining productive hyperparameters must be used [46]. Due to its association with the popular deep learning framework Keras and its strong results, KerasTuner was used to tune the hyperparameter values [23,47]. Of the hyperparameter algorithms provided by KerasTuner, Bayesian optimization and the Hyperband algorithm were explored. Bayesian optimization is a very efficient method as it takes into account past hyperparameter performance for the future decision. Hyperband is beneficial because it early-stops poor-performing sets of hyperparameter optimization in exchange for more emphasis on more promising sets of hyperparameters. Additionally, RandomSearch was tested briefly until it was apparent the other options were superior. RandomSearch is a method in which random combinations of hyperparameters are selected and used to train a model, resulting in reducing the number of hyperparameter configurations searched [47]. The Bayesian optimization hyperparameter algorithm assumes the optimization function comes from a Gaussian process. Based on all previous evaluations, the algorithm builds a probabilistic function on this assumption and attempts to optimize hyperparameters. Bayesian optimization is a black box approach, as the function being optimized is never directly identified [48].\n\nThe Hyperband algorithm employs a different approach called successive halving where each hyperparameter configuration is given a computational budget. After the budget is consumed, the algorithm filters through and determines the worst-performing configurations, terminating them. The remaining configurations are given another computational budget and the process continues until the most performant configuration remains. The algorithm assumes that all configurations can be stopped early and evaluated [49].\n\n5.1. Hyperparameter Categories\n\nMany categories of hyperparameters are available: some are specific to the type of model being used and the task being performed; others have a broader scope and can be applied to multiple models. The tuning performed in this research focuses on the latter. Specifically, the hyperparameters explored in this research include the network’s optimizer type, activation function, batch size, loss function, and dropout, which are explored in the remainder of this section. Each hyperparameter and its corresponding values were selected and optimized using a reasonably wide search space paired with a series of case studies. Hyperparameters and values that performed well were used in future case studies while those that performed suboptimally were dropped from future consideration. The values of numerical hyperparameters, such as batch size and dropout, were selected from a pool of practical size; the values of other hyperparameters, such as optimizer and activation function, were selected using the pool of values available through the Keras software. The impact of hyperparameter selection and values on the performance of each machine learning architecture is presented in the case studies of Section 6.\n\n5.1.1. Optimizer\n\nA key hyperparameter experimented with was the optimizer. An optimizer is an equation or a set of equations that update the values of the model weights during backpropagation by traversing the gradients of the loss function, which can be represented as a multidimensional curve. The purpose of an optimizer is to find a local minimum on this curve to increase model accuracy. Various optimizers exist, and each implements a different gradient-traversal method. The optimizers explored here include Adam, NAdam, AdaMax, and RMSProp [23,50,51,52].\n\n5.1.2. Activation Functions\n\nActivation functions are nonlinear layers in neural networks that require inputs to be greater than a critical value to be passed to further layers. They prevent the network from collapsing into a singular matrix and enable the network to perform more complex tasks. Selection of the proper activation function can make a significant difference to the performance of the network [23,53,54,55,56,57,58].\n\n5.1.3. Batch Size\n\nIn calculations for gradient descent, two schools of thought are presented for the management of training sources: stochastic gradient descent and batch gradient descent. The former suggests updating the model with each training data point; the latter suggests updating the model after processing each training data point reference. However, both stochastic gradient descent and batch gradient descent have drawbacks that can be analyzed to determine which will be more effective depending on the task.\n\nA trade-off exists between the two methods. Large batch sizes benefit heavily from the highly parallel nature of machine learning; therefore, the training execution time can be greatly reduced. However, larger batch sizes require large pools of available memory to perform calculations and can be trapped in local minima in the loss function. Smaller batch sizes tend to be more noisy, allowing optimizers to break out of local minima and saddle points [59].\n\n5.1.4. Loss Function\n\nThe loss function defines the margin of error of image classification in the network during training. Three loss functions were explored here: categorical cross-entropy, binary cross-entropy, and Kullback–Leiber (KL) divergence [60,61].\n\n5.1.5. Dropout\n\nDropout is a method to prevent overfitting. Using the dropout during training, a percentage of nodes from fully connected layers are dropped from the network, preventing their weights from being used or updated. This forces the network to prioritize more than one major network path and avoid overfitting. It also simulates training multiple subnetworks and combining the results into the overall network [62].\n\n6. Experimental Results\n\n6.1. Dataset Overview and Characteristics\n\nThe machine learning algorithms introduced in Section 2 and Section 3 were trained on the created dataset of 4500 RGB images. The dataset contains two classes of images: those with wind turbines (WT class) and those without (NWT class). The WT class has 2250 images that contain a small-scale wind turbine (12V Primus Air Max wind turbine) assembled at Utah Valley University (UVU). This wind turbine is shown in Figure 6. These images were captured on a Zenmuse L1 RGB camera that was mounted on a DJI Matrice 300 RTK drone. To ensure diversity and relevance to real-world wind turbine detection scenarios, emphasis was placed on creating dataset images with diverse angles and distances to the wind turbine to simulate perspectives that are commonly observed from a drone-mounted camera in a wind turbine farm. Additionally, images were captured in multiple weather conditions at various times of day to ensure the dataset was robust. The NWT class also has 2250 images that were taken in the same location as the WT images, so both sets have similar backgrounds including trees and sky. The NWT class also contains images captured at multiple times of day with various weather patterns. Additionally, all images in the dataset were manually validated to ensure that each image had been placed in the correct class and that each image was an accurate representation of the class it had been placed in.\n\nThe analysis of machine learning algorithms in this paper prioritized fast training times so that more experimentation and iterative improvement could occur. As a result, the images in the dataset were downscaled to 210 × 210 pixels. Additionally, the dataset is separated into 3150 training images and 1350 test images to verify the performance of the machine learning algorithms using previously unseen data. A selection of images from this dataset is displayed in Figure 6, where Figure 6a,b show sample images from the NWT and WT classes, respectively. Figure 6c,d show corresponding images after the application of the proposed FCE preprocessing technique of Section 4.\n\n6.2. VGG19 Experimental Results\n\nThe VGG19 network used the weights of the ImageNet dataset to expedite feature extraction, and the dense classifier on top helped in identifying whether there was a turbine in the image or not. The dense classifier had a total of six layers. The VGG base and dense classifier were trained concurrently for better results as described in Section 2.1. The number of neurons in the last layers depends on the number of classes in the training data, which is an important detail to remember. Since there are only two classes (turbine or no turbine) in the training database, the final layer contains two neurons. The VGG19 network underwent several hyperparameter searches and tuning in order to determine the combination of parameters that would perform the best on the dataset. This took place in Case Studies A1–A3 on images downscaled to 135 × 85 pixels so that successful hyperparameters could be identified more quickly due to the increased training speeds associated with smaller images. Case Studies A4–A5 apply the resulting hyperparameters to the 210 × 210 pixel dataset described at the start of this section for evaluation of fuzzy contrast enhancement. The sections that follow outline the design and results of these studies.\n\n6.2.1. VGG19 Case Study A1\n\nCase Study A1 used the RMSProp optimizer in grid search for the VGG19 network. The network’s dropout rate, image batch size, and optimizer learning rate were the hyperparameters selected for the grid search, while the validation accuracy was used to measure optimization. The image batch size was tested with values of 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 50, and 120, the optimizer learning rate with values of 10 − 5 , 10 − 4 , 5 × 10 − 4 , 10 − 3 , 10 − 2 , and 10 − 1 , and the dropout rate with values of 10%, 20%, and 30%. Each set of hyperparameters was trained on the wind turbine dataset for 100 iterations. Table 4 lists the best-performing hyperparameters for each search.\n\n6.2.2. VGG19 Case Study A2\n\nSince the VGG19 network received beneficial results with RMSProp, Case Study A2 used the same combination but with a different search space of the hyperparameters and a different search algorithm. The network’s dropout rate, image batch size, and optimizer learning rate were again chosen as the hyperparameters, but this time for the Bayesian optimization search. The validation accuracy was used as a measure to be optimized. The image batch size was tested with values of 20, 50, 100, 150, 300, 350, and 400, and the dropout rate was tested with values of 20%, 30%, and 50%. The optimizer learning rate was tested with the same values as Case Study A1. The wind turbine dataset was used to train for 100 iterations of all hyperparameter options. Table 4 lists the best-performing hyperparameters for each search. The performance of the VGG19 architecture with RMSProp in Case Study A2 was comparable to results from Case Study A1.\n\n6.2.3. VGG19 Case Study A3\n\nThis case study is very similar to Case Study A2. Since VGG19 performed well with RMSProp, the same hyperparameters were used in Case Study A3. The same search space for the hyperparameters was also used, but it was implemented via the Hyperband algorithm instead of Bayesian or grid search. The best-performing hyperparameters for each search are listed in Table 4. Across Case Studies A1 through A3, all combinations of hyperparameter values performed reasonably well.\n\n6.2.4. VGG19 Case Study A4\n\nTo obtain the final evaluation of VGG19’s performance for comparison with the other deep learning methods explored, VGG19 was retrained using only the top performing set of hyperparameters from Table 4; each image from the created dataset was then classified by this trained network. The results were gathered into a confusion matrix from which performance metrics such as accuracy and precision were calculated. The results of this process were averaged across 10 separate runs and the highest accuracy overall was recorded. The resulting averaged performance metrics, as well as the confusion matrix with the highest accuracy for this model, are given in Figure 7a.\n\n6.2.5. VGG19 Case Study A5\n\nThis case study tested the impact of fuzzy contrast enhancement as a preprocessing step on the image dataset for the VGG19 network. Its procedure replicated that of Case Study A4 in many ways. However, it differed in the addition of image preprocessing and a lower batch size of 128 rather than 300 which was used previously. These results are shown in Figure 8a and Table 3.\n\n6.3. Xception Experimental Results\n\nSix case studies of hyperparameter searches were conducted on the Xception network to find the combination which performed best on the wind turbine dataset. In order to increase the speed of hyperparameter selection, Case Studies B1–B4 used images downscaled to 135 × 85 pixels. Once hyperparameters had been identified which consistently performed well, they were applied to the larger 210 × 210 pixel images for evaluation of fuzzy contrast enhancement in Case Studies B5–B6. More information on the performance of each is described in the sections that follow.\n\n6.3.1. Xception Case Study B1\n\nThis case study paired the Xception network with the Adam optimizer while image batch size, optimizer learning rate, and the network’s dropout rate were allowed to vary as hyperparameters. The image batch size was tested with values of 1, 5, 10, 20, 32, 64, and 128, the optimizer learning rate was tested with values of 10 − 5 , 10 − 4 , 5 × 10 − 4 , 10 − 3 , 2 × 10 − 2 , and 10 − 2 , and the network dropout rate was tested with values ranging from 0% to 95% in 5% increments. For this case study, the hyperparameters were tuned with KerasTuner’s RandomSearch algorithm. Additionally, the results were averaged from three independent executions, and each search was trained for 30 epochs but set to stop early if epoch loss did not improve for three epochs.\n\nThe results from this case study are visualized in Figure 9. Notably, the batch sizes in the middle of the selected range (5, 10, 20, and 32) consistently performed with high accuracies (90–95%), while the extremes in the tested batch size range (1, 64, and 128) consistently had low accuracies (50–60%). The best hyperparameters are given in Table 5 under Case Study B1.\n\n6.3.2. Xception Case Study B2\n\nIn this case study, the hyperparameters were tuned using KerasTuner’s Bayesian optimization tuner. These hyperparameters included the dropout ratio, the learning rate, the activation function used in Xception’s final layer, the optimizer paired with the Xception network, and conditional inclusion of the dropout layer. The optimizer was tested with Adam and NAdam, the final layer activation function was tested with Softmax and Sigmoid, and the dropout ratio was tested with values of 0% through 90% in 10% increments when the dropout layer was included.\n\nDuring training, the learning rate was allowed to vary logarithmically with a minimum value of 10 − 5 and a maximum value of 10 − 1 . This assigns equal probabilities to each order of magnitude range [47]. The results from Case Study B2 are given in Figure 10, where it can be seen that Softmax consistently performed poorly as Xception’s final layer activation function, while Sigmoid consistently performed well. Softmax was removed from further trials for this reason. The hyperparameters that consistently performed well in this case study are listed in Table 5 under Case Study B2.\n\n6.3.3. Xception Case Study B3\n\nThis case study focused on tuning the Adam optimizer’s learning rate, Beta1, Beta2, Epsilon, and AMSGrad inputs as well as dropout ratio and batch size using Bayesian optimization. Each combination of hyperparameters was independently executed ten times, and the results of each were averaged to obtain each search’s final outcomes.\n\nThe hyperparameters were tested with values of 10 − 4 , 5 × 10 − 4 , 10 − 3 , and 2 × 10 − 3 for the learning rate, 0.0 and 0.9 for Beta1, 0.0, 0.99, 0.999, and 0.9999 for Beta2, 10 − 7 , 10 − 1 , and 1.0 for Epsilon, true or false for AMSGrad, and 0% through 50% in 5% increments for the dropout ratio. The batch sizes were tested with the same values as Case Study B1. The available values for Beta1 and Beta2 were selected based on [63], with Beta2 being modified to include a value of 0.0. The available values for Epsilon were selected from the Keras documentation. The results from Case Study B3 are visualized in Figure 11, and the hyperparameters with the highest average accuracies from this case study are listed in Table 5 under Case Study B3. The hyperparameters with the consistent best performance had batch sizes in the middle of the tested range (5, 10, 20) and dropout ratios in the upper half of the tested range (25–45%).\n\n6.3.4. Xception Case Study B4\n\nThis trial used the same hyperparameters with the same tested values as Case Study B3, but they were tuned with the Hyperband algorithm rather than the Bayesian optimization algorithm. The results are visualized in Figure 12, and the hyperparameters that had the highest averaged accuracies are given in Table 5 under Case Study B4. In Figure 12, note that the accuracies at the low-end of the scale are about 88%. In other case studies, the low end of the scale for accuracies ranged from 50% to about 68%. The Hyperband algorithm resulted in higher accuracies.\n\nAcross Case Studies B1 through B4, very low and very high batch sizes (below 5 and above 64) tended to perform poorly. Additionally, the NAdam optimizer and the Softmax final layer activation function performed poorly in combination with the other hyperparameters and values selected in Case Studies B1 through B4. The inclusion of the dropout layer was also a key hyperparameter: performance significantly decreased when the dropout layer was not included in the architecture. Overall, the best results were attained when using medium-range batches sizes (5 through 32), the Adam optimizer, the Sigmoid final layer activation function, and when a dropout layer was included in the architecture.\n\n6.3.5. Xception Case Study B5\n\nIn this case study, fine-tuning was implemented for the Xception network structure. The model was initialized with weights pretrained on the ImageNet dataset and given a densely connected final layer. Where appropriate, the model was assigned with the top set of hyperparameters from Table 5. To prepare the network for fine-tuning, the pretrained weights were frozen, while the final dense layer was trained on the wind turbine dataset. During fine-tuning, the final seventeen layers, including the densely connected layer, were unfrozen and trained with one-tenth of the learning rate used in the fine-tuning preparation stage. The model was evaluated using the process described in VGG19 Case Study A4. The results are illustrated in Figure 7b and Table 2.\n\n6.3.6. Xception Case Study B6\n\nThis case study analyzed the effect of implementing fuzzy contrast enhancement as a preprocessing step for the Xception network. Its procedure mirrored that of Case Study B5 with the only difference being the addition of image preprocessing. These results are given in Figure 8b and Table 3.\n\n6.4. SVM Experimental Results\n\nExperiments in this section were undertaken to explore the effects of the proposed FCE image preprocessing of Section 4 on the performance and accuracy of the SVM algorithm. Four SVM case studies were conducted, encompassing default hyperparameter settings and Bayesian optimization, both with and without FCE image preprocessing.\n\n6.4.1. SVM Case Study C1\n\nIn the first case study with SVM, the default hyperparameters were used. The model was built using the Scikit-learn library in Python and no hyperparameter values were altered. The default hyperparameter values are C = 1, Gamma = Scale, and Kernel = rbf. These hyperparameter values are the same for any SVM built using Scikit-learn in Python.\n\n6.4.2. SVM Case Study C2\n\nThe second case study with SVM is executed using Bayesian optimization instead of the default hyperparameters setting. This study aims to identify the optimal combination of hyperparameters to attain the highest accuracy for our model. The results are presented in Figure 7c and Table 2.\n\n6.4.3. SVM Case Study C3\n\nThe third SVM case study mirrors Case Study C1 by relying on default hyperparameters. However, it incorporates the proposed FCE procedure outlined in Section 4. Consequently, a preprocessing step is integrated into the SVM algorithm to modulate the intensity of all images within the generated dataset. This study aims to establish a baseline accuracy when implementing fuzzy contrast enhancement, providing a benchmark for comparison with the accuracy achieved in the subsequent section.\n\n6.4.4. SVM Case Study C4\n\nThe ultimate SVM study integrated elements from both Case Study C2 and C3, incorporating both Bayesian optimization and the proposed FCE preprocessing step of Section 4. The application of these combined techniques generated the highest accuracy attained by the SVM model. Comprehensive results and details of this conclusive case study are presented in Figure 8c and Table 3.\n\n7. Conclusions\n\nThis paper examines and contrasts the impact of applying fuzzy contrast enhancement (FCE) as an image preprocessing algorithm to various strategies for detecting the presence of wind turbines in RGB images, an initial key aspect of autonomous wind turbine inspection. The three methods under investigation are VGG19, Xception, and SVM. The primary contributions of this paper encompass the following:\n\nA comprehensive exploration, implementation, and comparison of three distinct machine learning algorithms, comprising two convolutional neural networks and the SVM algorithm. These algorithms are utilized to classify whether RGB images contain wind turbines.\n\nThe application of the proposed fuzzy contrast enhancement (FCE) data preprocessing step to the VGG19, Xception, and SVM machine learning algorithms, accompanied by a comparison of their conventional performance against their performance when augmented by this preprocessing step.\n\nThe creation of a novel Primus Air Max wind turbine classification dataset, consisting of 4500 RGB images, and its utilization to assess the performance of the implemented VGG19, Xception, and SVM algorithms.\n\nBased on our analysis, primary conclusions are as follows:\n\nThe assessed convolutional neural networks, namely Xception and VGG19, demonstrated commendable performances with accuracies above 98%. In contrast, as anticipated, the SVM algorithm exhibited a less favorable accuracy of around 90%.\n\nThe implementation of the proposed FCE results in enhanced accuracy for Xception and SVM, while VGG19 does not experience similar improvements.\n\nThe results presented in Figure 7 and Figure 8 and Table 2 and Table 3 demonstrate that implementing the proposed FCE leads to improvements in accuracy, precision, and F1 score. Specifically, for the Xception model, these metrics increase from 99%, 99.2%, and 98.99% to 99.18%, 99.5%, and 99.18%, respectively. Similarly, for the SVM algorithm, the application of FCE raises accuracy, precision, and F1 score from 90.3%, 91%, and 90.12% to 95.48%, 95.63%, and 95.48%, respectively.\n\nIn summary, FCE as a data preprocessing algorithm for wind turbine detection is promising: two of the explored machine learning architectures experienced a performance increase when this algorithm was applied. Future research into autonomous condition monitoring of wind turbines may similarly benefit from applying FCE as a dataset preprocessing step. For future investigations, the authors intend to expand the existing dataset to incorporate RGB images depicting both intact and defective wind turbine blades, with and without cracks. Further enhancements and training of the Xception, VGG19, and SVM algorithms are envisaged to facilitate their utilization in automated drone path planning, enabling the autonomous detection of faults in wind turbine blades.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization, M.A.S.M. and M.S.; methodology, Z.W. and M.A.S.M.; software, Z.W., J.M. and J.E.; validation, Z.W., J.M., J.E., M.A.S.M. and M.S.; formal analysis, Z.W., J.M., J.E. and M.A.S.M.; investigation, Z.W., J.M., J.E., M.A.S.M. and M.S.; resources, M.A.S.M. and M.S.; data curation, M.A.S.M. and M.S.; writing—original draft preparation, Z.W., J.M., J.E., M.A.S.M. and M.S.; writing—review and editing, M.A.S.M., M.S. and A.S.; visualization, Z.W., J.M., J.E., M.A.S.M. and M.S; supervision, M.A.S.M. and M.S.; project administration, M.A.S.M. and M.S.; funding acquisition, M.A.S.M. and M.S.
