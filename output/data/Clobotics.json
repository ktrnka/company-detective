      "# Post ID 13hxb18: Secret Shopper Websites? with +29 score by [(hauntedcartoonheart, Reddit, 2023-05-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/13hxb18/secret_shopper_websites/)\nDoes anyone have any recommendations for secret shopper programs? I used to do those types of jobs on clickworker (though for those you just took pictures of displays), but they don't appear on there often so I figured I'd try a website dedicated to secret shopper jobs. There's not really any recent posts on here about it (save for 7 months ago - someone mentioned Presto Shopper and Field Agent?), so I figured I'd ask since there may be new info available.\n\n## Comment ID jk7gjr5 with +9 score by [(spareblushes, Reddit, 2023-05-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/13hxb18/secret_shopper_websites/jk7gjr5/) (in reply to ID 13hxb18):\nI think a lot depends on your area/region. The store audits in Field Agent are good when they come around, but there's only one or two decent ones a week where I'm at. There's Ipsos, which has a mystery shopper side but also a specific program for people between like 18-35 where you buy age restricted items and report if you got carded.\n\n## Comment ID jk7eeue with +10 score by [(Beermoney_Mods, Reddit, 2023-05-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/13hxb18/secret_shopper_websites/jk7eeue/) (in reply to ID 13hxb18):\n> There's not really any recent posts on here about it\n\nTry searching for [Mystery Shopping](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/search/?q=Mystery+Shopping&sort=new&restrict_sr=on)\n\n## Comment ID jk9duiz with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/13hxb18/secret_shopper_websites/jk9duiz/) (in reply to ID 13hxb18):\nEvery one of them that I have tried have severely underpaid for every job, and have offered very few jobs within my driving distance.\n\n## Comment ID jk8sulr with +3 score by [(KayakingLady, Reddit, 2023-05-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/13hxb18/secret_shopper_websites/jk8sulr/) (in reply to ID 13hxb18):\nDo a Google search for mystery shopping forums. There are several. They usually have a list of companies to sign up with.  It’s a win to find a company that has work near where you live.

You had to take pictures of displays. It takes an hour or less. Just make sure you take pictures of everything they ask if you see it. One time I think I got mine disqualified because I didn’t notice one part of the display and they saw it slightly in one of my photos.\n\n### Comment ID jkja5q1 with +1 score by [(Dorkus18, Reddit, 2023-05-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/13hxb18/secret_shopper_websites/jkja5q1/) (in reply to ID jk7b830):\nDon’t do clickworker if it uses the clobotics app\n\n#### Comment ID jks97v7 with +1 score by [(AntiqueCapital5764, Reddit, 2023-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/13hxb18/secret_shopper_websites/jks97v7/) (in reply to ID jkja5q1):\nIs there something wrong with the clobotics app?

Reimbursement only for some fast food shops slightly less so. But some of their other companies are worth it.\n\n#### Comment ID jkbgoyr with +3 score by [(hannahmel, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/13hxb18/secret_shopper_websites/jkbgoyr/) (in reply to ID jkaya6c):\nI only do Five Guys. If you wait it out, I've gotten up to $42 per shop. I don't accept less than $15 unless it's a delivery. But the best thing is that they reimburse for tolls, so if I know I'm going into NYC for the day, I grab a shop and they cover tolls and parking!\n\n## Comment ID jkaysvs with +2 score by [(InevitableArt5438, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/13hxb18/secret_shopper_websites/jkaysvs/) (in reply to ID 13hxb18):\nYour best bet is just to google mystery shoppers and check them all out for things that are available in your area. I have friends that do it in a few different states and we all have different things available from different companies. But as mentioned before, the pay is not always reflective of the effort needed to successfully complete. You need to factor in travel time, prep time, actual shop time, and completing the form and sending it in.\n\n## Comment ID jk7md90 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/13hxb18/secret_shopper_websites/jk7md90/) (in reply to ID 13hxb18):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID jk7uanu with +2 score by [(Beermoney_Bot, Reddit, 2023-05-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/13hxb18/secret_shopper_websites/jk7uanu/) (in reply to ID jk7md90):\n####Your comment was removed for the following reason:\n\n----\n\nDo not ask people to pm or visit your profile for referral links or codes or for information.

I try to follow similar steps with the app, test user, key, etc. but can't find it or get the right access.\n\nIs Meta trying to make it extra burdensome to embed Instagram feeds outside of their platform? It used to be easy, but what am I missing now?\n\n## Comment ID loq51wu with +4 score by [(---_____-------_____, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fohd2r/anyone_else_struggling_with_connecting_an/loq51wu/) (in reply to ID 1fohd2r):\nYeah, I used to write my own feeds using the Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram APIs.

Poorly documented, regular bugs and outages, inconsistent errors. And that's not even getting into the whole app review, business verification and data-use checkup stuff.\n\nThey also recently announced the deprecation of the Basic Display API, which means that only professional Instagram accounts will be able to access their own content via API.

You can also take screenshots of the profile and add them to your site.\n\nInstagram offers an API that allows you to display the feed on your website, but it requires some coding knowledge.For more information, visit: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-facebook-login. \n\nAnother option is to add a menu or submenu linking directly to your Instagram profile so visitors can view the content on Instagram. You can also add a button on your website that links to your Instagram profile.\n\nTo embed an Instagram post, go to the post, click the three dots in the top-right corner, and select \"Embed.\". Click the \"Copy embed code\" button and paste it into your website's admin panel on the desired page.\n\nFor an easier way to embed Instagram feeds, you can use tools like SociableKIT.\n\n## Comment ID lxxk0lq with +1 score by [(Elfsight, Reddit, 2024-11-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fohd2r/anyone_else_struggling_with_connecting_an/lxxk0lq/) (in reply to ID 1fohd2r):\nHey there!\n\nYou're not alone in feeling the pinch with embedding Instagram feeds lately. Meta has indeed tightened the reins on how third-party platforms access Instagram content, primarily to bolster user privacy and data security.\n\nI also consulted GPT on this issue resulting in: ‘Instagram no longer provides a toggle switch for embedding an entire profile like it does for individual posts. The \"copy embed code\" button is only available for individual posts, reels, or videos, and not for entire profiles. This means you can't embed your whole Instagram profile using a built-in option directly from Instagram's settings, even on a professional account’.\n\nSo, if you don’t mind using a third-party solution for your use case, I could recommend you to get a plugin from the [Wordpress Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/Instagram/). It is the responsibility of their developers to ensure a proper display no matter what. \n\nFor instance, you could try our [Instagram Feed plugin](https://elfsight.com/instagram-feed-instashow/wordpress/) that lets you embed profiles and posts using multiple filters for a nice display. Our support team is always in touch with you to ensure the feed is shown the way you expect.\n\nIf you have any questions and need further information, feel free to reach out to us.\n\nRegards,\n\nElfsight Team\n\n### Comment ID lxykddg with +1 score by [(Various-Ask3371, Reddit, 2024-11-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fohd2r/anyone_else_struggling_with_connecting_an/lxykddg/) (in reply to ID lxxk0lq):\nI don't mind tightening security, but the problem I'm having is that now the account owner (the client) has to sign in and do a bunch of technical stuff and create a test user to complete the connection... for any service or plugin.

And unless you're one of the lucky few to have a mobile device or OneNote web that doesn't restrict your edit access, you're basically stuck like the rest of us.\n\nIn the Microsoft Forums, there's been a stream of new posts in the last 24 hours talking about how people have lost access to their notebooks, and it does not appear that the community moderators nor the MS employees are on the same page, as they seem to be unaware of this post here and the increasing number of users that have been affected:\n\n[OneNote sync failure error code: 0xE00009C8 bb0ur - Microsoft Community](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/onenote-sync-failure-error-code-0xe00009c8-bb0ur/0163b840-3c1f-4c39-9d03-bc2749beb35c?page=1&messageId=be94f7ba-1e56-4620-abdd-260711259618)\n\nNow I understand that diagnosing the issue and fixing things takes time, and that there's probably a limited number of employees who are actually troubleshooting the issue as we speak. But radio silence, vague replies, and random guesses on restoration time from Microsoft is not going to end well, especially when we have gone almost a week with OneNote being bricked like this.

For the past 4-5 years, the plugin team at [WP.org](http://WP.org) was reviewing plugins and making them remove trademarked words from their plugin names and slugs or forcing them to use them in a correct way. This did not include only the name 'Wordpress' but any trademarked name in tech. What they were saying was basically:\n\n\"WordPress Smileys\" -> Not ok name for a plugin\n\n\"Smileys for WordPress\" -> Ok, but still dont use WordPress, use WP. To start with a WP plugin having the word WP or WordPress in the name in the *WP* repo did not make sense anyway. Its not like you could install those plugins to some other software.\n\nThey also made people remove the entire word from their plugin names if the owner of that trademark was very litiguous. So this was not something related to only WordPress but a general change of situation across the open source ecosystem.\n\n#### Comment ID lpe2kgd with +3 score by [(throwawaySecret0432, Reddit, 2024-09-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lpe2kgd/) (in reply to ID low2rdh):\nIt was WORSE with WooCommerce.

Lawyers are going to have a field day with this.\n\n### Comment ID los6hmu with +1 score by [(wolfcognito, Reddit, 2024-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/los6hmu/) (in reply to ID lor5l4u):\nAgreed - it’s in such wide use, I don’t see how it could be approved.\n\n## Comment ID loqu1f4 with +8 score by [(randombummer, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/loqu1f4/) (in reply to ID 1fol35p):\nIt's just petty.\n\n## Comment ID lor89vu with +6 score by [(vAPIdTygr, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lor89vu/) (in reply to ID 1fol35p):\nNah, this is a horrible, greedy move.\n\n## Comment ID lor7e36 with +12 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lor7e36/) (in reply to ID 1fol35p):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID lot0gbd with +3 score by [(ikefalcon, Reddit, 2024-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lot0gbd/) (in reply to ID lor7e36):\nThis has nothing to do with using the software.

There's no shortage of companies who build walled gardens and keep the users inside, never leaking any view, click, or conversion out. WordPress makes it possible to have your own piece of the web, which you can migrate between hosts, or modify in a way that suits you. Run your own host? Feel free. In a sense, all hosts that support WordPress are also part of the open web. There's competition between us but we are all together against the closed source site builders, closed source social media, and the government censorship entities.\n\nIt was built that way and spread so much because it's built that way and we all believe in open source.\n\nSo no, Matt wouldn't close source anything :-)\n\n## Comment ID los26ms with +3 score by [(MtnXfreeride, Reddit, 2024-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/los26ms/) (in reply to ID 1fol35p):\nCan someone explain this for people who arent following this..\n\n\nWordpress foundation wants to trademark the term managed wordpress?\n\n\nHow can they trademark something so commonly used? \n\n\nThis is just on the terminology and would still allow a managed hosting by third parties, right?

That trademark is held by the WordPress Foundation. They reserve the non-profit use of the name “WordPress” for the Foundation, and the commercial use of the license is granted to Automattic. Using the “WordPress” trademark commercially requires getting approval from Automattic. Newfold Digital pays Automattic a licensing fee to use this trademark.\n\nThis post is about the WordPress Foundation additionally filing to trademark the phrase “managed WordPress.” If granted, then it would prevent companies from using the phrase “managed WordPress” when advertising their services unless they get permission from the WordPress foundation. Companies could still offer managed WordPress, but they would have to call it something else unless they get permission.\n\n## Comment ID loqyccr with +7 score by [(Rarst, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/loqyccr/) (in reply to ID 1fol35p):\nEhm... how would WPF possibly justify and protect trademarks related to hosting, since... it's not a hosting provider.\n\n### Comment ID lorfbf0 with +1 score by [(user_number_666, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lorfbf0/) (in reply to ID loqyccr):\nthank you!\n\n## Comment ID lorjoeg with +2 score by [(life3_01, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lorjoeg/) (in reply to ID 1fol35p):\nThis reminds me of the ClickFunnels debacle.

I have been around long enough to remember how this all played out.\n\nWhen the first commercial WordPress plugins came out, people lost their shit.  Everyone trying to make money on it was told you couldn't have Pro plugins and they needed to be free.  Thankfully Matt and others came to the rescue then and convinced the community this was allowed.  This was all 2008-2010 ish.\n\nThen people started taking those Pro plugins and reselling them as-is.  Wait a second, that's my hard work, how can they do that?  Once again, people said \"hey, it's GPL, we can do as I want\".  That's when everyone discovered the magic of trademarks.  Matt did a few presentations talking about that, and lots of Pro plugin and theme authors started acquiring the trademarks for their products.  It didn't stop someone from using your code, but it did stop them from using the name to market it.\n\nNow what appears to be happening is an overreach of using trademarks and shaming as a way to get competitors to disappear.  Basically it seems like a shakedown is starting to occur where anybody using the name WordPress, even in a product description, is in the crosshairs.  It seems that the 5% time hasn't been a huge success, so they are trying to forcibly extract it from companies under the pretense of paying an ongoing licensing fee to use WordPress as your product description, even though that's allowed under basically fair use.  \n\nMatt opened pandora's box with his keynote, but he doesn't seem to appreciate what he's done yet.  Almost every old time WordPress person I've talked to (some of which had top 5 plugins) are in agreement that he's basically pulling the temple down on his own head at this point.\n\n### Comment ID lot1k02 with +3 score by [(ikefalcon, Reddit, 2024-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lot1k02/) (in reply to ID lormn7q):\nThat, and if the trademarks are not enforced then they will be lost and using the trademark will be considered fair use.\n\n## Comment ID lorpspz with +2 score by [(azunaki, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/lorpspz/) (in reply to ID 1fol35p):\nYikes\n\n## Comment ID loukyxp with +1 score by [(Oli_Picard, Reddit, 2024-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fol35p/wordpress_foundation_filed_in_july_to_trademark/loukyxp/) (in reply to ID 1fol35p):\nVery glad I decided to jump over to the JAM stack and build sites static now.

My job there could be divided into three parts -- developing SKU classification algorithms, analyzing current error types and learning Azure Machine Learning Services for our model training. One of the most amazing things I found there was classifying SKUs in all kinds of photos where even it was hard for manual identification. With the cooperation work with different groups, the final results were really impressive. I was really glad to have the chance to do an intern there.\r\n1. Really really good mentorship!!!\r\n2. Challenging work of classification and a great sense of achievement after getting good accuracy.\r\n3. The office atmosphere is both relaxing and busy. During the lunch break, everyone was relaxed and talked about different interesting things. In work time, everyone was working hard.",

      "# [The AI Sector in China. Much Smaller Than the US, Similar in Size to the UK. — Glass.AI by Sergi Martorell on 2023-09-06](https://www.glass.ai/glass-news/mapping-the-ai-sector-in-china-much-smaller-than-the-us-and-similar-in-size-to-thenbspuk)\nIntroduction\n\nThe UK is preparing to host the first global AI summit, but it’s unclear if China will attend or be invited. This is partly due to the fact that there is an AI arms race going on between the West (especially the United States) and China, and we are only in the early stages.\n\nThere are many ways to measure this technological race and the size of the respective AI sectors. Leading publications have provided some data, for example, a Nikkei study argued that China is far surpassing the U.S. in both quantity and quality of AI-related papers, with Tencent, Alibaba and Huawei among the top 10 companies producing AI research. China also seems to lead in AI patent filings, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and several papers.\n\nThat said, the United States leads in terms of investment, and we know that US firms invested billions into the Chinese AI sector (before restrictions were imposed). Below is some data published by Bloomberg recently:\n\nThe US also kickstarted the Generative AI revolution, a fundamental technological shift. The success of ChatGPT accelerated the ongoing race for AI supremacy not only among the tech giants but also between countries. China recently published new rules for generative AI, becoming one of the first countries in the world to regulate this new technology.\n\nIt’s an open race that will continue over the coming years across many dimensions. Some argue that China will win because of its talent, growing technological skill and innovation, and national investment in science and technology. Others point out that while China has caught up with impressive speed, the conditions that allowed it to do so will likely also prevent it from taking a meaningful lead in the AI race.\n\nUnfortunately in this debate, there is limited data about the AI sector in China beyond the tech giants and the data on academic publications and patents. In this article, we aim to contribute to the debate by providing data and evidence about the companies in the AI sector in China. We have previously researched hundreds of emerging technology sectors globally, including the AI sectors of the United States and the United Kingdom. It wasn’t easy to replicate this for China but we’ve built techniques that have allowed us to crawl the Chinese ‘open’ web. Here is what we found.\n\nMethodology\n\nglass.ai is an AI research capability that reads the web to discover, understand and track the activities of companies. Since 2022, we’ve been tracking companies on a global scale, including companies in China that have a web presence and content in Standard Chinese, the modern standardized form of Mandarin Chinese.\n\nTo identify the AI companies in China and gather details about their products and services, we used our capability to crawl the Chinese web, that is, millions of company websites, news sources, social media, sector-specific sites and other sources. Our AI read content in Chinese and also gathered any evidence that appeared in English. For reference, below are the main sources our AI reads to discover and track companies globally:\n\nHow did we determine if the companies are based in China?\n\nWe have an ongoing discovery process that reads websites across different country domains and classifies the sites as company websites if it detects certain criteria around content (e.g. active, in Chinese/English, business content) and if possible, will predict the sector and geography of the business (e.g. an address in China). This, combined with any addresses mentioned on social sites and news sources, gives us extra validation about the location of the companies. The AI can also gather evidence on foreign AI companies with significant presence/activity in a particular country. This is how we mapped a large part of the Chinese economy based on its web presence and then identified the AI companies. In this particular piece, we focused on AI companies that are headquartered in China.\n\nHow did we identify Chinese AI companies?\n\nAt the start of the research, we used a list of 100+ semantically related AI categories, topics/keywords, phrases and other criteria that define the boundaries of the AI sector. At glass.ai, we have completed various research projects that have mapped the AI sectors of different countries. As a result, we already have a well-defined taxonomy that has been used in recent studies to discover companies that focus on AI. For the research on China, we didn’t want to reinvent the wheel, therefore we applied the same taxonomy to identify Chinese AI firms. The long list of AI topics/phrases was translated from English to Chinese.\n\nBelow are the main high-level categories:\n\nOur next step involved deep-reading a total of 6m+ Chinese company websites to identify any text that suggested the companies develop AI products or services. To ensure more complete coverage, we augmented the results with other data sources like news, social media, and sector-specific sources. We also leveraged previous studies and papers that have looked into the AI ecosystem to train and fine-tune our language models.\n\nSize of the AI Sector in China\n\nOur research capability was able to identify a total of 3,373 AI companies in China across sectors, AI categories and geographies. This includes both private and public-listed companies. It’s important to caveat that the Chinese ‘public web’ is less open than in other countries. This comes with some challenges but we are confident that our results are a good proxy of the size of the Chinese AI sector.\n\nThe crawler picked up the top tech companies in China (Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba, ByteDance, Huawei, JD.com and Xiaomi) as they are actively applying AI technologies, and some have launched large language models (LLMs) recently. It also identified the top AI companies in China like Mobvoi, Rokid, Megvii, CloudWalk, SenseTime, Hikvision and others. But more importantly, it managed to uncover several thousand Chinese AI companies that have never been mentioned in any previous research. We provide some examples further below.\n\nAt a high level, the results showed that a clear majority of companies use generic terms and phrases like Artificial Intelligence or AI to describe their core activities (3,637). It’s worth noting that many companies fall into more than one high-level category.\n\nThe analysis also confirmed that China has many AI companies in the Computer Vision and Image Processing category (783). This includes companies that specialize in facial recognition, machine vision, image processing, image recognition and other sub-categories.\n\nComputer Vision was followed closely by Intelligent Robotics (728) and the Machine Learning (368) and Deep Learning (278) categories, with a combined total of 646 companies. There were 164 firms focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP), 129 in Data Mining and 59 companies in the Generative AI category. The rest of the companies were in Speech Recognition (37), Autonomous Vehicles (26) and Machine Translation (25). It’s worth noting that there were another 200+ companies that fell into multiple smaller categories.\n\nWe also did some semantic clustering of the various descriptions to get a more granular view of the activities of the companies, highlighting how some of the core technologies are being applied. For example, deep learning in healthcare and drug discovery, machine vision for security, quality control, and monitoring systems, and big data in smart cities, logistics and IoT platforms. It also highlights the application of AI technology in traditional areas such as advertising, finance and fraud detection.",
