      "# Post ID 1ff1byy: Anyone Else Frustrated with Google LSA’s New Automated Lead Review System? with +21 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1ff1byy/anyone_else_frustrated_with_google_lsas_new/)\n**Is anyone else frustrated by Google LSA's new automated lead review system?**  \n  \nI recently tried to dispute an illegitimate lead, only to discover they've removed the manual dispute option. Now, the only option is to rate leads as 'satisfied' or 'dissatisfied'—which doesn't really help when you're dealing with bad leads.  \n  \nThis new automation lead crediting system is clearly not working—bad leads are slipping through, and yet we’re still being charged.\n\nWhen I emailed Google's LSA service about these leads, this was the underwhelming response that I received: \n\n*\" We appreciate you for reaching out to us about your concern regarding the quality of the lead you have received and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. It saddens me to say but the dispute option is no longer available due to our new process and policy.*\n\n*With Automated Local Services Ads lead credits, Google will review all leads and automatically credit invalid leads.*  \n  \n*We understand that you may have concerns and reservations about this decision, and we truly appreciate your candid feedback. Based on the decision, the result is already final. We understand that the decision may not be the outcome you were hoping for, and we genuinely empathize with your situation.*  \n  \n*The best thing you can do is to rate the lead to provide feedback for all leads, which will improve our systems and the type of leads we send you. Where you used to see “dispute,” you will now see an option to “Rate this lead.*  \n  \n*We will do our best to send you fewer leads you share negative feedback about. Though we may occasionally credit a lead you were dissatisfied with\"*\n\nIt’s frustrating that we're expected to trust this automated system when it’s clearly missing illegitimate leads. **Has anyone else run into this?

It seems obvious that would be the case, why would they rank a brand higher that would then circle back and request their money back. Google' wants to make money from your leads and their access.\n\nBut people wanted their money back, so the majority disputed. I even had to convince a number of clients that I do in fact have their best interest in mind because they wanted to dispute all bad leads and I told them that was not the way I manage the accounts. \n\nI tested this across accounts. I knew what I was doing worked. In time too I was able to turn \"dead\" LSA accounts back alive. \n\nGoogle's auto-system did its job in time for the absolute horrible leads. The others that slipped through the cracks I just brushed them aside as cost of doing business. My accounts were always profitable of course.\n\n### Comment ID lmskw0h with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1ff1byy/anyone_else_frustrated_with_google_lsas_new/lmskw0h/) (in reply to ID lmrvd9d):\nThis is a very insightful response, I've never thought to consider this perspective before, thank you for sharing.\n\nSo you're thinking that accounts that dispute crappy leads get 'shadowbanned' in the Google ranking system? I see what you're saying about how Google is trying to retain the money spent on advertising, and that frequent disputes could lead to accounts being deprioritized.\n\nI've had to inform our team about the recorded Google calls, and we try to verbally say: '*We don't offer that service*' in hopes that the call will be flagged for dispute. But now that you've mentioned your approach, I realize we might need to reconsider how we manage these disputes.\n\nFor example, one of our most recent LSA lead calls involved a customer asking to refill their A/C with R-22, which has been illegal and phased out since 2020. We don't offer that service and even took the time to educate the customer on why it's no longer available. Despite clearly stating '*we don’t offer that service*,' Google's new automation didn’t catch it, and we were still charged.\n\nOn top of that, after we raised our LSA budget, we saw a massive increase in 'ghost calls'—calls where no one picks up on the customer’s end. These are impossible to dispute, but we’re still being charged for them. It feels like automation just isn’t effective enough to manage these types of issues.\n\n#### Comment ID lmvu2ov with +1 score by [(85campaigns, Reddit, 2024-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1ff1byy/anyone_else_frustrated_with_google_lsas_new/lmvu2ov/) (in reply to ID lmskw0h):\n> For example, one of our most recent LSA lead calls involved a customer asking to refill their A/C with R-22, which has been illegal and phased out since 2020.

I have had some clients already express frustration at the change, but what I've told them is that you should absolutely be rating every single lead you get. Google will not credit you for leads you rate as terrible, but by rating every lead (***honestly***, I should add) you're essentially training the algorithm to provide you better leads in the future.\n\nIn the long run, I expect this change to favor those who are proactive in rating leads, but in the short run it's going to suck.\n\n## Comment ID lmry4px with +2 score by [(samuraidr, Reddit, 2024-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1ff1byy/anyone_else_frustrated_with_google_lsas_new/lmry4px/) (in reply to ID 1ff1byy):\nI think there’s a false advertising suit to be had here.

For example, I have one client that sells windows, who just started LSA last month. Most of the calls to the business have been for glass repair or putting screens on windows which he does not do (he does full window frame replacments). To a human listening to the call, it is obvious that these calls are not quality leads. For whatever the reason, the \"trained\" AI thinks they are.  Although Google does have a differentiation in categories for window replacement and glass repair (we have it check marked for the former, not the latter), human end users have a hard time apparently distingusihing those service categories from one another. \n\nWe have rated each call, but haven't seen one call credited back to us. I was going to call and talk to someone but interestingly, there is no longer a phone number being shown on the account. Interesting side note, the phone number was very prominent when we we having an issue connecting the account. \n\nLastly, here are the terms as stated from Google *\"For more than a year, we’ve worked to train machine learning models to understand which leads are high quality. With Automated Local Services Ads lead credits, Google will review all leads and automatically credit invalid leads\\*.*\n\n*With this system, there is a shift and Google will no longer be able to support 'job type not serviced' and 'geo not serviced' leads. However,* ***we’ll still credit more leads on average,*** *overall, and your feedback matters more than ever. To help improve your future leads, fill in the lead feedback survey for every lead you receive in your inbox.\"*\n\nI highlighted the verbiage there becasue while that may on average be helping all users, the system still appears to be flawed in the micro-context of a particular local small business owner trying to find a way to actually get real quality leads.\n\n## Comment ID lmrctlw with +1 score by [(TTFV, Reddit, 2024-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1ff1byy/anyone_else_frustrated_with_google_lsas_new/lmrctlw/) (in reply to ID 1ff1byy):\nGood, more advertisers will move back to Google Ads ;-)\n\n### Comment ID lms9iec with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1ff1byy/anyone_else_frustrated_with_google_lsas_new/lms9iec/) (in reply to ID lmrctlw):\nI like the Google Display ads, I find they bring customers to different sections of our website.   \n  \nDuring the Summertime, we had higher bidding rates, for the HVAC industry (for LSA's) than we did for the Display ads.\n\n## Comment ID lvyinl4 with +1 score by [(Sonic_Boom1, Reddit, 2024-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1ff1byy/anyone_else_frustrated_with_google_lsas_new/lvyinl4/) (in reply to ID 1ff1byy):\nFile dispute with credit card company.

And unless you're one of the lucky few to have a mobile device or OneNote web that doesn't restrict your edit access, you're basically stuck like the rest of us.\n\nIn the Microsoft Forums, there's been a stream of new posts in the last 24 hours talking about how people have lost access to their notebooks, and it does not appear that the community moderators nor the MS employees are on the same page, as they seem to be unaware of this post here and the increasing number of users that have been affected:\n\n[OneNote sync failure error code: 0xE00009C8 bb0ur - Microsoft Community](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/onenote-sync-failure-error-code-0xe00009c8-bb0ur/0163b840-3c1f-4c39-9d03-bc2749beb35c?page=1&messageId=be94f7ba-1e56-4620-abdd-260711259618)\n\nNow I understand that diagnosing the issue and fixing things takes time, and that there's probably a limited number of employees who are actually troubleshooting the issue as we speak.

Issue is, we suspect that it is impacting our mail flow since multiple users are reporting that their recipients are receiving blank emails from them. We're almost positive it has to do with this since we don't have other third party apps that would interact with our mail flow they way Exclaimer does.\n\nIs anyone else experiencing a similar issue?\n\n## Comment ID lja2pwq with +2 score by [(BioA_IT, Reddit, 2024-08-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1exw5c6/blank_or_empty_emails_possible_issue_with/lja2pwq/) (in reply to ID 1exw5c6):\nHave you tried testing this by sending an email to an external account you control, like a generic Gmail account? If that email arrives blank, try disabling the mail flow rule and try again, if the email still comes through as blank then the issue isn't Exclaimer. If it comes through with the body of the email but no signature, then the issue is either with the mail flow rule or Exclaimer. At that point I would suggest reaching out to their support. \n\nThere should have been some kind of onboarding help from them to ensure the mail flow rule was set correctly.\n\n## Comment ID ljfkyr3 with +2 score by [(BobDanger, Reddit, 2024-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1exw5c6/blank_or_empty_emails_possible_issue_with/ljfkyr3/) (in reply to ID 1exw5c6):\nYes. Our users are reporting that external recipients are getting blank emails when viewed in the native Mail app on iOS (Apple Mail). No other email client seems to be having this problem, as far as we can tell. I believe this has to do with using an embedded image in an Exclaimer template. I removed our firm's logo and this seemed to \"fix\" the emails from showing up blank.\n\nHowever, I think there is much more going on... Attaching an email (.EML file) and sending it externally would essentially replace the content of the attached email with the content from the sent email. It's really weird...\n\nI have a support ticket open and had an hour long support session this morning where Exclaimer support was able to  see the \"blank email\" issue happen and they were going to discuss at a management meeting. I'm still waiting to hear back on how the meeting went and have not discussed the .EML issue with support yet; I only recently discovered that part.\n\n  \nAlso, forgot to mention that Mimecast customers are placing our emails to them on hold.

And I was inspired by all them to set up goals and work hard (very high work efficiency). My job there could be divided into three parts -- developing SKU classification algorithms, analyzing current error types and learning Azure Machine Learning Services for our model training. One of the most amazing things I found there was classifying SKUs in all kinds of photos where even it was hard for manual identification. With the cooperation work with different groups, the final results were really impressive. I was really glad to have the chance to do an intern there.\r\n1. Really really good mentorship!!!\r\n2. Challenging work of classification and a great sense of achievement after getting good accuracy.\r\n3. The office atmosphere is both relaxing and busy. During the lunch break, everyone was relaxed and talked about different interesting things. In work time, everyone was working hard.",

      "# [The AI Sector in China. Much Smaller Than the US, Similar in Size to the UK. — Glass.AI by Sergi Martorell on 2023-09-06](https://www.glass.ai/glass-news/mapping-the-ai-sector-in-china-much-smaller-than-the-us-and-similar-in-size-to-thenbspuk)\nIntroduction\n\nThe UK is preparing to host the first global AI summit, but it’s unclear if China will attend or be invited. This is partly due to the fact that there is an AI arms race going on between the West (especially the United States) and China, and we are only in the early stages.\n\nThere are many ways to measure this technological race and the size of the respective AI sectors. Leading publications have provided some data, for example, a Nikkei study argued that China is far surpassing the U.S. in both quantity and quality of AI-related papers, with Tencent, Alibaba and Huawei among the top 10 companies producing AI research. China also seems to lead in AI patent filings, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and several papers.\n\nThat said, the United States leads in terms of investment, and we know that US firms invested billions into the Chinese AI sector (before restrictions were imposed). Below is some data published by Bloomberg recently:\n\nThe US also kickstarted the Generative AI revolution, a fundamental technological shift. The success of ChatGPT accelerated the ongoing race for AI supremacy not only among the tech giants but also between countries. China recently published new rules for generative AI, becoming one of the first countries in the world to regulate this new technology.\n\nIt’s an open race that will continue over the coming years across many dimensions. Some argue that China will win because of its talent, growing technological skill and innovation, and national investment in science and technology. Others point out that while China has caught up with impressive speed, the conditions that allowed it to do so will likely also prevent it from taking a meaningful lead in the AI race.\n\nUnfortunately in this debate, there is limited data about the AI sector in China beyond the tech giants and the data on academic publications and patents. In this article, we aim to contribute to the debate by providing data and evidence about the companies in the AI sector in China. We have previously researched hundreds of emerging technology sectors globally, including the AI sectors of the United States and the United Kingdom. It wasn’t easy to replicate this for China but we’ve built techniques that have allowed us to crawl the Chinese ‘open’ web. Here is what we found.\n\nMethodology\n\nglass.ai is an AI research capability that reads the web to discover, understand and track the activities of companies. Since 2022, we’ve been tracking companies on a global scale, including companies in China that have a web presence and content in Standard Chinese, the modern standardized form of Mandarin Chinese.\n\nTo identify the AI companies in China and gather details about their products and services, we used our capability to crawl the Chinese web, that is, millions of company websites, news sources, social media, sector-specific sites and other sources. Our AI read content in Chinese and also gathered any evidence that appeared in English. For reference, below are the main sources our AI reads to discover and track companies globally:\n\nHow did we determine if the companies are based in China?\n\nWe have an ongoing discovery process that reads websites across different country domains and classifies the sites as company websites if it detects certain criteria around content (e.g. active, in Chinese/English, business content) and if possible, will predict the sector and geography of the business (e.g. an address in China). This, combined with any addresses mentioned on social sites and news sources, gives us extra validation about the location of the companies. The AI can also gather evidence on foreign AI companies with significant presence/activity in a particular country. This is how we mapped a large part of the Chinese economy based on its web presence and then identified the AI companies. In this particular piece, we focused on AI companies that are headquartered in China.\n\nHow did we identify Chinese AI companies?\n\nAt the start of the research, we used a list of 100+ semantically related AI categories, topics/keywords, phrases and other criteria that define the boundaries of the AI sector. At glass.ai, we have completed various research projects that have mapped the AI sectors of different countries. As a result, we already have a well-defined taxonomy that has been used in recent studies to discover companies that focus on AI. For the research on China, we didn’t want to reinvent the wheel, therefore we applied the same taxonomy to identify Chinese AI firms. The long list of AI topics/phrases was translated from English to Chinese.\n\nBelow are the main high-level categories:\n\nOur next step involved deep-reading a total of 6m+ Chinese company websites to identify any text that suggested the companies develop AI products or services. To ensure more complete coverage, we augmented the results with other data sources like news, social media, and sector-specific sources. We also leveraged previous studies and papers that have looked into the AI ecosystem to train and fine-tune our language models.\n\nSize of the AI Sector in China\n\nOur research capability was able to identify a total of 3,373 AI companies in China across sectors, AI categories and geographies. This includes both private and public-listed companies. It’s important to caveat that the Chinese ‘public web’ is less open than in other countries. This comes with some challenges but we are confident that our results are a good proxy of the size of the Chinese AI sector.\n\nThe crawler picked up the top tech companies in China (Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba, ByteDance, Huawei, JD.com and Xiaomi) as they are actively applying AI technologies, and some have launched large language models (LLMs) recently. It also identified the top AI companies in China like Mobvoi, Rokid, Megvii, CloudWalk, SenseTime, Hikvision and others. But more importantly, it managed to uncover several thousand Chinese AI companies that have never been mentioned in any previous research. We provide some examples further below.\n\nAt a high level, the results showed that a clear majority of companies use generic terms and phrases like Artificial Intelligence or AI to describe their core activities (3,637). It’s worth noting that many companies fall into more than one high-level category.\n\nThe analysis also confirmed that China has many AI companies in the Computer Vision and Image Processing category (783). This includes companies that specialize in facial recognition, machine vision, image processing, image recognition and other sub-categories.\n\nComputer Vision was followed closely by Intelligent Robotics (728) and the Machine Learning (368) and Deep Learning (278) categories, with a combined total of 646 companies. There were 164 firms focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP), 129 in Data Mining and 59 companies in the Generative AI category. The rest of the companies were in Speech Recognition (37), Autonomous Vehicles (26) and Machine Translation (25). It’s worth noting that there were another 200+ companies that fell into multiple smaller categories.\n\nWe also did some semantic clustering of the various descriptions to get a more granular view of the activities of the companies, highlighting how some of the core technologies are being applied. For example, deep learning in healthcare and drug discovery, machine vision for security, quality control, and monitoring systems, and big data in smart cities, logistics and IoT platforms. It also highlights the application of AI technology in traditional areas such as advertising, finance and fraud detection.",

      "# [🌎 Trump's climate transition #229 by CTVC on 2025-01-21](https://www.ctvc.co/trumps-climate-transition-229/)\nHappy Tuesday!\n\nWe’re diving into the news trumping everything else this week — that’s right, the start of the Trump administration and what this all might mean for climate.\n\nIn other news, the UK is investing more in nuclear fission and fusion; the first underground injection CCS permit in California; and big climate bond news.\n\nIn deals, $7bn for EVs, $2bn in lithium extract across two deals, and $260m in sustainable space vehicle components.\n\nPlus, if you want to hear our takes live, tune into our Line of Sight webinar this Thursday, 23 January, from 11am-12pm ET / 3pm-4pm UK time, for the State of the Climate Capital Stack and Investment Trends, and what’s in store for 2025.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nNot a subscriber yet?\n\n📩 Submit deals and announcements for the newsletter at [email protected].\n\n💼 Find or share roles on our job board here.\n\nInside Biden’s last days, and Trump’s first days\n\nLast week, the Biden administration hit the gas with a flood of climate announcements, racing to lock in its climate and energy priorities before the finish line. Then on Monday, Trump and his team officially took the wheel and wasted no time in issuing a flurry of orders, many steering in the opposite direction. Here’s what’s landing and what’s looming.\n\nWhat happened\n\nDepartment of Energy funding: Under Biden, the DOE’s Loan Programs Office, Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, and Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains finalized several loan guarantee and grant announcements, including:\n\nAn up to $6.6bn loan guarantee to support financing for EV maker Rivian’s second factory in Georgia​\n\nAn up to $1.7bn loan guarantee for Plug Power to develop up to six facilities for producing low- or zero-carbon hydrogen using the company’s electrolyzers​\n\nAn up to $996m loan guarantee for Ioneer’s Rhyolite Ridge Lithium-Boron Project in Nevada, a mining and processing facility​\n\nAn up to $289.7m loan guarantee for Sunwealth to finance the development of commercial solar and storage systems for virtual power plants in 27 states​\n\nA $225m grant for Standard Lithium and Equinor’s construction of the South West Arkansas project, a high-grade lithium brine initiative using Direct Lithium Extraction technology​​\n\nTax credit guidance: Not to mention, in the past few weeks, the IRS released final guidance on tax credits for hydrogen, clean fuels, and clean electricity.\n\nNew department heads: Last week, the Senate held confirmation hearings for the Trump administration’s new picks to head key climate federal agencies:\n\nChris Wright, President Trump’s nominee for new DOE head, pledged to prioritize domestic energy production, including fossil fuels, liquefied natural gas, and nuclear power, while acknowledging the DOE’s role in accelerating new energy technologies to combat climate change, but still reaffirming his commitment to President Trump’s pro-drilling agenda. He also declined to immediately halt outstanding LPO loans.\n\nDoug Burgum, Trump’s nominee for Interior Secretary, emphasized achieving U.S. \"energy dominance\" during his Senate confirmation hearing, framing it as critical for national security. He advocated for expanded fossil fuel extraction on public lands and waters, viewing these resources as part of the nation’s \"balance sheet,\" while also promoting baseload energy sources like coal and natural gas to power data centers and compete in the AI arms race against China.\n\nLee Zeldin, nominee for EPA Administrator, testified before the Senate and revealed few details about plans to change or roll back environmental regulations, beyond pushing for fiscal responsibility. He recognized climate change and the problem of PFAS pollution.\n\nExecutive orders: Both Biden and Trump issued climate-related executive orders:\n\nBiden issued a new executive order directing the Department of Defense and DOE to lease federal sites for private sector use to build AI infrastructure at scale\n\nTrump, after calling for ending the “Green New Deal” in his inauguration speech, fired off a blast of executive orders, declaring an \"energy emergency\" in the US and the promise to \"drill baby, drill\":\n\nBanning offshore wind lease sales in federal waters, plus pausing approvals, permits and loans for both onshore and offshore wind projects\n\nDeclaring a national “energy emergency” to bolster domestic energy production, transportation, refining, and generation, directing more drilling on federal lands and expedited permits\n\nRepealing EPA tailpipe emissions rules and restarting LNG terminal approvals\n\nRolling back Biden’s environmental justice initiatives, protections for Alaskan coastal drilling (and other areas), appliance energy efficiency standards, federal procurement for EVs, clean power, low-carbon buildings, and more\n\nSeeking to pause funds from the IRA and withdraw from the Paris Agreement\n\nWhy it matters\n\nThe US federal government is one of the biggest investors in climate tech via its funding and tax credit programs, among others, which were significantly boosted by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). While the IRA provided significant resources for both emerging and mature techs, the future under a Trump administration remains uncertain, as Trump’s campaign promises included repealing the IRA, hinting at targeting programs like the LPO (Project 2025, the conservative policy blueprint, explicitly called for eliminating the LPO). However, Trump held off on immediately issuing new tariffs which could raise project costs and impact clean energy supply chains.\n\nStill, this introduces new ambiguity for ongoing and conditional commitments, despite assurances from Biden’s DOE officials that finalized awards are legally binding and difficult to reverse. The lack of clarity on Trump’s plans for energy and climate funding introduces risks for developers, funders, and founders reliant on federal support, especially for conditional commitments still in the pipeline (such as a $15bn for California utility PG&E for hydropower, LDES, and more; $22.4bn in loans for eight US utilities across 12 states for clean energy and infrastructure investments; $4.8bn for a Midwestern transmission line project; and $1.8bn for energy storage startup Hydrostor’s Willow Rock Energy Storage Center).\n\nMeanwhile, the newly chosen department heads (who can be sworn in after approval from the Senate now once the new president takes office) and Trump’s executive orders also have the potential to shift the energy landscape of the US — in favor of fossil fuels — at a key moment when energy demand is rising, and as the planet officially surpassed the critical 1.5-degree threshold for the first time last year.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nUncertainty for clean project developers. Project developers and investors are building long-term assets where (hopefully) the economics pencil out, but need clarity on (high) upfront costs. This confusion about public funding and incentives could scare off hesitant investors, or lead to project delays for developers, especially given the legal challenges that deregulation is likely to face.\n\nBut not all sectors are affected equally. Trump is essentially pushing for more “baseload” power, so strong on gas and coal, as well as nuclear, geothermal, and hydropower. Factors like his moves to streamline permitting could actually end up spurring new nuclear projects to meet this demand. However, for variable energy sources, this could hurt. Rollbacks on wind farm leasing and Biden’s EV and clean power initiatives would inevitably slow renewables growth.\n\nTrump’s impact on energy production is still reliant on broader global trends. Despite Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” rhetoric, the US is already producing record-high levels of oil and gas, and the economic incentive for further drilling is limited, particularly as shale extraction is costlier than traditional oil and gas. Additionally, gas prices today are only a small factor in the lifetime cost of new power infrastructure, such as 30-year gas plants. While boosting supply may exert downward pressure on US gas prices, the expansion of LNG export terminals could offset this by increasing global demand. Ultimately, Trump’s policies pull levers in conflicting directions, creating uncertainty about their net impact. The anticipated growth in US gas plants appears driven more by technological trends, particularly data center energy demand, than by fuel prices or policy changes alone.\n\nDeals of the Week (1/13-1/19)\n\nLate-Stage / Growth\n\n🏭 STOKE Space, a Renton, WA-based sustainable space vehicle components developer, raised $260m in Series C funding from MaC Venture Capital.\n\n🌳 Colossal Biosciences, an Austin, TX-based de-extinction technology developer, raised $200m in Series C funding from Animal Capital, At One Ventures, Bold Capital Partners, Brandon Fugal, Breyer Capital, and other investors.\n\n🚚 Harbinger, a Gardena, CA-based medium-duty EV trucks manufacturer, raised $100m in Series B funding from Capricorn Investment Group, Leitmotif, ArcTern Ventures, Coca Cola, Ironspring Ventures, and other investors.\n\n⚡ Amogy, a Brooklyn, NY-based ammonia-based energy developer, raised $56m in Growth funding from Aramco Ventures, SV Investment Corp, AFW Partners, AP Ventures, BHP Ventures, and other investors.\n\n⚡ H2SITE, a Santiago de Compostela, Spain-based hydrogen membrane separation reactor developer, raised $37m in Series B funding from Hy24, Suma Capital, Enagás, Exergon, and MassMutual Ventures.\n\n💨 BeZero Carbon, a London, England-based carbon ratings and risk analytics platform, raised $32m in Series C funding from GenZero, EDF Pulse Ventures, Hitachi Ventures, Illuminate Financial, Intercontinental Exchange, and other investors.\n\n🛵 Zypp Electric, a Gurgaon, India-based last-mile delivery EV rental service, raised $7m in Series C funding from ENEOS, 9Unicorns, Ajay Kumar Aggarwal, Anthill Ventures, Eiman Abdullah, and other investors.\n\n✈️ Infinium, a Sacramento, CA-based electrofuels developer, raised an undisclosed amount in Series C funding from Brookfield Asset Management, AP Ventures, Amazon Climate Pledge Fund, Development Bank of Japan, Japan Hydrogen Fund, and other investors.\n\nEarly-Stage\n\n⚒️ ElectraLith, a Melbourne, Australia-based direct lithium extraction service provider, raised $28m in Series A funding from Main Sequence Ventures, Breakthrough Victoria, Chevron Technology Ventures, Fathom, Hostplus, and other investors.\n\n🔋 Moment Energy, a Coquitlam, Canada-based EV battery repurposing service, raised $15m in Series A funding from Amazon Climate Pledge Fund, Voyager Ventures, Climate Capital, Fika Ventures, In-Q-Tel, and other investors.\n\n💨 Origen, a London, England-based direct air capture with mineralization technology developer, raised $13m in Series A funding from Barclays, Elemental Impact, Exascale Fund, Hatch, and Shell Ventures.\n\n✈️ Metafuels, a Zürich, Switzerland-based E-SAF from methanol producer, raised $9m from Celsius Industries, Contrarian Ventures, Energy Impact Partners, Fortescue, RockCreek, and other investors.\n\n🔋 Circunomics, a Mainz, Germany-based circular battery platform, raised $9m in Series A funding from Schaeffler Group, Orlen, and RISE.\n\n🌬 Clobotics Wind Services, an Esbjerg, Denmark-based wind turbine inspection services, raised $5m in Series A funding from KTB Network, Capital Development Investment Fund, and GGV Capital.\n\n🌱 GreenStitch, a London, England-based sustainability solutions for textiles service provider, raised $1m in Seed funding from Equirus Capital, Amit Kumar Agarwal, Anshuman Bapna, IvyCap Ventures, Pankaj Vermani, and other investors.\n\nOther\n\n🚗 Rivian, an Irvine, CA-based Electric Vehicle manufacturer, raised $7bn in Debt funding from US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO).\n\n⚒️ EnergySource Minerals, a San Diego, CA-based lithium extraction service, raised $2bn in Loan funding from US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO).\n\n⚡ Origis Energy, a Miami, FL-based renewable energy project developer, raised $1bn in PE Expansion funding from Antin Infrastructure Partners and Brookfield Asset Management.\n\n🥩 Formo, a Berlin, Germany-based alternative cheese manufacturer, raised $36m in Debt funding from European Investment Bank (EIB).\n\n🏠 Ecozen, a Pune, India-based sustainable cold chain technology provider, raised $23m in Debt funding from Maanaveeya, Northern Arc Capital, Private Finance, and responsAbility Investments.\n\n🚗 Euler Motors, a New Delhi, India-based EV manufacturer, raised $20m in Debt funding from responsAbility Investments.\n\n🌾 ORCAL, a Junction City, OR-based crop protection and sustainable farming service provider, raised an undisclosed amount in PE Buyout funding from Baden Capital.\n\nExits\n\n⚡ Greyrock Technology, a Sacramento, CA-based gas conversion solutions provider, was acquired by Infinium for an undisclosed amount.\n\nNew Funds\n\nRidgewood Infrastructure, a New York, NY-based investment firm, raised $1.2bn for its second fund, focusing on essential infrastructure, including water, energy, transportation, and utilities.\n\nCan’t get enough deals?
