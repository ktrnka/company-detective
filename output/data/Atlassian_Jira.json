This information was also present earlier but only for a limited number of $0 transactions; it has now been populated for all $0 transactions that have discounts.\n\nData can be seen in the purchaseDetails.discounts array field of the transaction API. Partners can fetch this data using the lastUpdated field of this API. Change is live in production starting (today).\n\nWe have back-filled the data for zero-dollar transactions for approximately 86,000 transactions across partners, and we will provide this discount information for future zero-dollar transactions. This includes all currently active and historical $0 transactions in the past that have a discount associated with them.\n\nToday we published a blog titled Taking the Ecosystem Forward: An Update on the Future of Connect, which shares an early look at plans to phase out support for Connect. This early announcement is intended for owners of business critical Connect apps, including partners and customers with custom apps, to provide ample time to explore requirements and arrive at a fair timeline for end of support, together.\n\nWe’re seeking your feedback to help us shape the next steps for Connect - you can provide your feedback via the survey linked in the blog post.\n\nFrom , the use of web triggers will exclude apps from the Runs on Atlassian eligibility criteria.\n\nThis is because Forge web triggers currently allow for the egress of customer data returned in response to third-party requests.\n\nWhile we understand that using web triggers is unavoidable for some use cases involving external systems, we’re also looking to uphold the integrity of the Runs on Atlassian badge for customers.\n\nEligibility requirements may change leading up to the launch of the program.\n\nAtlassian Marketplace APIs will now share data for lifetime free licenses data to our partners through the licenses report.\n\nThis license data for life time free apps is based on analytics data generated during the installations of these apps and has been transformed into free licenses. These licenses will only be available via the APIs and not through the user interface on the Marketplace portal.\n\nPartners will be able to access this data via the existing license report APIs (GET as well as EXPORT) using the new showLifeTimeFreeLicenses filter:\n\nhttps://marketplace.atlassian.com/rest/2/vendors/{vendorId}/reporting/licenses?showLifeTimeFreeLicenses=true - Get life time free apps licenses data\n\nhttps://marketplace.atlassian.com/rest/2/vendors/{vendorId}/reporting/licenses/async/export?showLifeTimeFreeLicenses=true - Initiate async export of life time free apps licenses data\n\nhttps://marketplace.atlassian.com/rest/2/vendors/{vendorId}/reporting/licenses/export?showLifeTimeFreeLicenses=true - Export life time free apps licenses data\n\nMore details section contains the applicable fields from licenses report for these new free licenses.\n\nPartners can start accessing this data from . We highly recommend all partners to take a look at the quick reference guide to understand more about this data.\n\nMany apps use bodied macros to allow Confluence users to add rich Confluence content inside of them while editing a page. Then, when the user publishes the page, the app applies formatting to the content and renders it in a “display” state on the published page.\n\nSince live pages are designed to not need to be published, we have added a way to see a bodied macro’s “display state” directly while editing. Now, you can switch between bodied macros “editing” and “display” with a simple click in live pages. See More details for a GIF example.\n\nWith the recent updates to our content delivery network (CDN), all Custom UI apps now allow-list the Atlassian media API URL by default. This means you no longer need to declare egress to load images coming from the media API in Custom UI apps.\n\nUnsplash images now load by default as well, so you no longer need to include the images.unsplash.com egress permission from Custom UI apps.\n\nThese recent updates can effectively help you reduce egress from your Custom UI apps.\n\nThese updates can help if you’re looking to make your app eligible for the Runs on Atlassian badge. To know more about Runs on Atlassian, see this developer blog post.\n\nNote, the removal of egress does not require a major version update of apps.",

      "# Post ID izu5u3: Everyone hates Jira, but no one stops using it with +115 score by [(dbartholomae, Reddit, 2020-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/)\nHi there!\n\nFrom countless conference discussions and Twitter threads it seems there is a universal haze of developers for Jira as a project management tool. But still, whenever I ask a dev in a company with more than a handful devs - they use Jira. How come?\n\nWhat are your gripes with Jira? Which other solutions did you try? And what was missing in the end?\n\n## Comment ID g6l49vo with +127 score by [(PragmaticFinance, Reddit, 2020-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6l49vo/) (in reply to ID izu5u3):\nIt's more of an artifact of when the company was started. For a period of time, Jira was the go-to tool for project management. Once a company starts using it, it's difficult to build enough momentum to switch to something else. So it sticks.\n\nThe real problem with Jira is that it's too customizable, which makes it easy for people to develop painful workflows and systems. Jira has too many complex options and many project managers feel a need to use as many of the features as they can. If you have an ambitious project manager with Jira admin privileges, you can end up with a mess of workflows, tickets with way too many fields, and other busywork that makes Jira painful to use.\n\nUsing basic Jira, especially their next-gen project format, is actually not that different than any other generic ticket management software. As long as you can keep the project managers from over complicating it, Jira isn't too bad.\n\n### Comment ID g6lby8d with +22 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6lby8d/) (in reply to ID g6l49vo):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID g6lfbzy with +13 score by [(qeomash, Reddit, 2020-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6lfbzy/) (in reply to ID g6lby8d):\nStates are low priority to remove for me.

Any other tool they spend 15 minutes of every meeting complaining. \n\n None of them like bending their will to match a tool. So I guess jira says \"we can do that\" it's pretty tempting to buy in.\n\n### Comment ID g6lbvt0 with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6lbvt0/) (in reply to ID g6l49vo):\nI worked on a jira project which had 12-15 statuses, so each column in the board had 3 or 4 rows. Image how it looks with 50 tickets in a sprint and that's for a team of 5.Next-gen project are better, even for basic usage the old template was too complex.\n\n### Comment ID g6lf7fs with +2 score by [(gotogosub, Reddit, 2020-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6lf7fs/) (in reply to ID g6l49vo):\nYes. So much this. Jira was cool back in 2008. But then everyone created monstrosities with their custom projects/fields/hooks. Also, it's old tech. Almost any newer project management tool is faster, simpler, and keeps in sync better (ever forget to refresh a Jira ticket?)\n\n#### Comment ID g6p9d2h with +5 score by [(fouoifjefoijvnioviow, Reddit, 2020-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6p9d2h/) (in reply to ID g6lf7fs):\nWhat's a good ticket system these days?\n\n#### Comment ID hrn0yi3 with +4 score by [(n3rder, Reddit, 2022-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/hrn0yi3/) (in reply to ID g6lf7fs):\nThis! Highly underrated comment. My biggest beef with Jira is it feels outdated, sluggish, and their editor is just plain garbage. There are so many problems with the editor that it feels death by a thousand cuts at times...\n\nSome examples: \n\n1. I want to enter a bloc quote and type  bq. What does Jira? It inserts | bq. \\[text\\] so I have to delete every time the bq. after typing it. \n2. Dropped images in the comment window are always set to full size and I constantly have to rescale them to make the page and tiny comment section readable. \n3. Their markdown editor has many formatting issues.\n\n### Comment ID g6pcz8y with +1 score by [(twoplus2is4minus1is3, Reddit, 2020-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6pcz8y/) (in reply to ID g6l49vo):\n>As long as you can keep the project managers from over complicating it, ...\n\nRelevant for everything related to software engineering.\n\n## Comment ID g6l0eu6 with +274 score by [(Athomas1, Reddit, 2020-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6l0eu6/) (in reply to ID izu5u3):\nI don’t hate jira\n\n### Comment ID g6ll5rt with +96 score by [(foundboots, Reddit, 2020-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6ll5rt/) (in reply to ID g6l0eu6):\nYeah.

What they actually hate is the process their company built. \n\nJira can be used to build out pretty much any process, but that makes it also very complex to manage. So people basically sit down and build out \"THE PROCESS\" over a couple weeks, and then never want to touch it again. However, processes need to grow and change as companies do, and when that happens you end up being forced to use your company's antiquated process in Jira while trying to do work in the now. And developers, especially younger ones, blame this on Jira instead of not having a person who can go into Jira and change the workflows to something more sane.\n\nThat said, I have my gripes. It is sometimes VERY slow. It has a big learning curve for customization: you need someone on staff that is good at managing it, and is willing to make changes as the need comes. \n\nI've used Microsoft Team Foundation, I've used Trello, I've used older stuff like HP's thing they bought and mangled a decade ago. Nothing is \"great\". You need to make the tool fit what you're doing.\n\n## Comment ID g6l0xqu with +14 score by [(FredMcCree, Reddit, 2020-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6l0xqu/) (in reply to ID izu5u3):\nJira is pretty great IMO.

Its a SAAS. It pleases corporate overlords, it integrates well, it's extremely flexible and customizable. There's a lot to be said about sending a help desk ticket over to development for triage without having to do anything but click a button (well, click, then make sure the fields migrate, click two or three more times, and then hope it doesn't fail during the move 🤦‍♀️).\n\nI've had to host and care for it in the past. That was enough to turn me off to it.\n\nI've built really complex workflows with it, and used it for very simple kanban. Even stripped down, it's still too complicated. The wealth of features tend to lead to practices that can be bad for overall productivity even if they look useful on the surface (sub-tasks, for example).\n\nI do like the UX/performance enhancements made in the last few years, but Atlasssian changes things too often, IMHO. \n\nI was bummed when I heard Atlasssian bought Trello. I love Trello. It's been getting a little bloated with features, but it was about perfect for most projects - 3 or 4 columns, flags, maybe stickers, rich text and you're cracking to get stuff done. Simple notifications, good mobile app, it's about perfect.

On the other extreme, subtasks can be trivial things that don't need to be enumerated, so its just noise. So subtasks make it easy to hide work, or make something look more complex than it is, and that kills velocity. Its hard or counter-intuitive to work on subtasks in parallel, which limits the effectiveness of a team.\n\nThis is in my experience, anyway. I have used subtasks for certain things like operations processes so I don't forget steps and can let someone else pick up the work easily. I've found adding a list in the description does the same job and doesn't clutter up the board with issues. Thats another thing - when we've used subtasks they make the board harder to look at - you can easily loose context in certain views (this is configurable and customizable but that's the gross/great thing about Jira).\n\n## Comment ID g6ljfla with +9 score by [(rafuzo2, Reddit, 2020-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6ljfla/) (in reply to ID izu5u3):\nIt’s like democracy: the worst form of government, except for all the others\n\n## Comment ID g6l65fg with +3 score by [(underdaawg, Reddit, 2020-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6l65fg/) (in reply to ID izu5u3):\nWhat do you like?

The prior software we used was very friendly to those of us in Business Controls and Operations as a database of prior tickets, outcomes, etc for effective management of business control issues, etc - but now with Jira, getting access to projects and different tickets is so convoluted and segmented, I gave up on it. I have access to main Jira, but apparently, I need to be given access to every project or ticket created to be able to look at anything. Now, when someone asks me anything about tickets for remediation efforts or business control reasons, I just tell them to reach out to tech. Its really bad now because we have no idea what issues have already been submitted, are being worked on, what the outcome was, etc- we are flying blind. Im sure duplicate issues submitted as defects have gone up significantly since we started using this shit- but Im also sure no one is going to do squat about it.\n\n### Comment ID m2cnwkv with +1 score by [(purpurne, Reddit, 2024-12-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/m2cnwkv/) (in reply to ID ke92gt0):\nSounds like a big problem that can be solved with someone managing a spreadsheet.",

      "# Post ID u0j7oz: Atlassian alternatives thread with +590 score by [(PaleoSpeedwagon, Reddit, 2022-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/)\nHey y'all, [for one reason or another](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u01uia/atlassian_is_still_down/), some of us are looking for alternatives to Atlassian products. I thought I'd try to start a little thread here where we can share our discoveries. What I'd love to see, if you have experience with a product and want to share, is:\n\n* Name of product\n* Which Atlassian product would it replace?\n* What are the best parts about it?\n* Are there any gotchas you've noticed?\n* Presence of useful features you care to talk about: SSO, backup/restore, integrations\n\nFor example, [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/). A Jira alternative with an eye toward project management. It worked well for our scrum team, I believe it also supports Kanban. The UI is modern. It's got tons of integrations to things people actually use (e.g. Git, Slack) and the Enterprise level, at least, supports SSO (I don't know if other levels do). Pricing seems reasonable. They do point-in-time backups every 6 hours and allow you to export your data. It's been a few years since I worked with it, but I remember setting up our stories/columns was a little fiddly. And of course, it's a one-trick pony. It will not replace Confluence.\n\nHere are the products I've seen mentioned, none of which I have experience with, but it would be rad if some of you with experience spoke up on these:\n\n* [Notion.so](https://Notion.so)\n* [Outline](https://www.getoutline.com/)\n* [Phabricator](https://www.phacility.com/phabricator/)\n* [BookStack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/)\n* [Youtrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/)\n\n## Comment ID i478jlv with +116 score by [(thursday51, Reddit, 2022-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i478jlv/) (in reply to ID u0j7oz):\nHoly *shit*, are they STILL down???\n\n### Comment ID i47uvqu with +80 score by [(ThisIsTenou, Reddit, 2022-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i47uvqu/) (in reply to ID i478jlv):\nShort answer: Yes.\n\nLong answer: Very much.\n\nhttps://status.atlassian.com/\n\n#### Comment ID i487rgr with +38 score by [(castillar, Reddit, 2022-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i487rgr/) (in reply to ID i47uvqu):\nThanks for this—totally screencapping that Jira work record for the next time someone grouches at us for using Jira Datacenter instead of going “all-in on all-cloud all-the-time”.\n\n### Comment ID i48irea with +30 score by [(1esproc, Reddit, 2022-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i48irea/) (in reply to ID i478jlv):\nThis was apparently for under 400 customers at the start, it's not like it's all their cloud customers.

This is almost scarier than if it was a global outage. Because it was only 400 customers, but here we are, a week later, and they still have only been able to restore 160 customers. Speaking as an ops eng, to me this reveals a rather terrifying house of cards from a systems architecture standpoint. \n\nThe fact that Atlassian has been in business so long and has never, as a matter of *policy*, been willing to invest energy in restoring a single customer, tells me that this work is simply too laborious for them, too laden with \"if/then\" landmines that you find when services are bolted onto the side of an original systems design rather than thoughtfully integrated at the outset. \"We can't script this because it's too bespoke\" is NOT an enterprise answer to any request. \n\nAnd the folks in this thread who are like \"Whew! We weren't hit, we sure got lucky,\" I say, yeah, you got lucky. This time. But if they're rolling scripts out to prod without proper change management, it's only a matter of time before you're next. \n\nStop what you're doing and back your content up right now.\n\n#### Comment ID i4ahyfd with +1 score by [(The-Dark-Jedi, Reddit, 2022-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i4ahyfd/) (in reply to ID i48irea):\nAnother thread mentioned 35% of their cloud customer base.\n\n### Comment ID i497uwp with +5 score by [(landob, Reddit, 2022-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i497uwp/) (in reply to ID i478jlv):\nAs someone with self hosted Atlassian...I am very glad we are self hosting...\n\n### Comment ID i49eim3 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i49eim3/) (in reply to ID i478jlv):\nNot sure exactly what the outage is tbh, We migrated to Atlassian cloud last quarter and last week we saw 0 issues last week, other than I believe someone said it took a little long to move pages between folders.\n\n## Comment ID i46bgif with +37 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i46bgif/) (in reply to ID u0j7oz):\nWe use GitLab and teamdynamix at work.\n\nI use mantisbt and gitea at home.\n\n### Comment ID i47hqd3 with +11 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i47hqd3/) (in reply to ID i46bgif):\nGitea actually is rather amazing for it's size\n\n#### Comment ID i48tzgx with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i48tzgx/) (in reply to ID i47hqd3):\nYep, it does everything I need and then some.\n\n### Comment ID i47atnx with +2 score by [(qci, Reddit, 2022-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i47atnx/) (in reply to ID i46bgif):\nI like Kanboard for project management.\n\n## Comment ID i468q1e with +106 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i468q1e/) (in reply to ID u0j7oz):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID i46igx4 with +120 score by [(DaNPrS, Reddit, 2022-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i46igx4/) (in reply to ID i468q1e):\nWe started using this last year.

Missing key features like view counts and page stats, the ability to search only within a specific 'pages and subpages (ie a KB), and the organization of 'pages' within a workspace is woefully inadequate for any halfway large organization. Shit you can't even link pages from elsewhere in your workspace without duplicating them under every page they're linked to, its atrocious. Nor can you have sub-pages without them being visibly linked on every parent page. These problems *really* show when your org reaches any significant size. Formatting pages is also nice when you learn all the hacks and glitches to bring it up to pae with the basic functionality of *squarespace*, but unfortunately so much of it relies on you intentionally glitches things that it can and will break your formatting with updates.

I want it to succeed, but I've got some complaints:\n\n- **No \"group-level\" issues**: (Issues are scoped to projects.) My team contains both engineers as well as non-engineers. When there's a bug to report, which project do you create the issue in? We've got a bunch of separate projects because of how we split up our code -- some are \"frontend\", others  \"backend\" for separate services. Best approach is to either (ab-)use \"Epics\" as user stories (good luck explaining to people that they need to ignore the \"Create Issue\" button) or simply move issues to the correct project, possibly from a single empty \"Inbox\" project (which *closes* the original issue and creates a new one *with a new number* in the destination project - making it really difficult for my project manager to keep track of). **Issues are directly coupled to deployable units of code, which places undue burden on bug reporters**.\n- **Issue editor isn't WYSIWYG** - I expect they'll fix this soon; the Wiki editor gained a WYSIWYG option recently.\n- **Can't require specific fields when issues are created** - I've heard people complain about project managers over-configuring JIRA so logging an issue requires filling out a million form items. But it would be pretty great if I could force issue reporters to specify which project to track my time toward when I fill out my timecard, rather than me hound them for it after the fact.\n\nThat's... well, that's most of it.

Of course, it wasn't visible to them because they do all their testing on their internal VPN 🤦‍♂️\n\nGitHub/GitHub actions would be my recommendation for code/build. Decent community, and support hasn't been terrible yet.\n\nOctopus Deploy is my recommendation for deployment/release management - you actually get to talk to developers when troubleshooting an instance, and they'll actually log in and take a look (with permission of course) rather than just reading you a script.\n\nThat leaves work tracking (jira) and wiki (confluence). GitHub does an ok job at Work Tracking if you're a more technical company. I guess a GitHub pages / wiki would work too - but those are the 2 main things that need to move off of Atlassian at this stage.\n\n#### Comment ID i49ex0q with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i49ex0q/) (in reply to ID i46xtxb):\nYeah we’re in the middle of contract negotiations in conjunction with our parent org for our Microsoft licenses and what products we want to go forward with in Azure, I’ve not had amazing experience with their O365 teams (I’m still pissed about their mailbox usage reporting in O365 like who the fuck thought that reporting only updating once a week is a good idea).

In my opinion it is a great product, you can do diffs within phab itself and it is extremely customize-able. Herald rules allow you to do so many odd little jobs. The downside's are we had trouble scaling it up, and it is no longer actively maintained. It was originally developed at facebook, and then spun off into it's own product and company. I believe facebook is still using it in some form or another, underneath a much nicer GUI. If you like to tinker, I still think it is a solid product.

      "# Post ID 3n2sc1: Why Fogbugz lost to Jira with +579 score by [(pdeva1, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/)\n\n\n## Comment ID cvkf1gp with +428 score by [(gecko, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkf1gp/) (in reply to ID 3n2sc1):\nI worked at Fog Creek from 2006 to 2014. This article is wrong, even factually, about a lot of things.\n\nFirst, I find the premise that FogBugz \"lost\" a bit odd. It unquestionably never achieved JIRA's ubiquity, but it still exists, Fog Creek still exists, and the money FogBugz generated Stack Overflow and Trello. If that's a failure, then I would love to have another one of that scale.\n\nBut even exploring why JIRA won the majority of the market share is wrong. Here's why that actually happened:\n\n  1. **They undercut us on price for the one market segment we couldn't afford to match.** This is the single biggest factor. Atlassian figured out pretty quickly that they could charge practically nothing for JIRA licenses for 10-person shops, and then make it by having a massive step-up for enterprise licenses. But nearly all FogBugz customers were ten-person shops or less; charging $10 for a starter pack would've murdered our income.\n  2. **They had a functioning sales team; we had only a marketing team (consisting entirely of Joel).** The parent article is incorrect about this. I don't care what you want to call the team; Atlassian had people on staff who built relationships with _managers_ at tech companies. This meant that they were _able_ to land a lot of those enterprise sales that Joel's blog wouldn't reach. If you want to get 10-person shops, Joel on Software is great. If you want to get 200-person shops, you really need someone building up a relationship with managers from day one. We figured this out and did have a sales team, but too late (and again, we couldn't match on price). Again, I'm unclear where the parent article concluded neither company had sales teams; we've both even blogged about them before (e.g. http://blog.fogcreek.com/why-do-we-pay-sales-commissions/).\n  4. **We didn't take VC.** This meant that Atlassian simply had way more developers to throw at the problem at any given point, whereas Fog Creek had to grow much, much more slowly. Throw in the above sales issues, and the problem compounds, badly. Note that neither Trello nor Stack Overflow repeated that mistake.\n  4. **We didn't have a sane agile strategy.** We felt like you could build an agile workflow in FogBugz with the built-in tooling. That's true, to a point, but Atlassian meanwhile made things like Greenhopper, and managers really like things like Greenhopper. And finally, the only technical issue,\n  3. **Our Unix on-site version sucked a lot of resources.** This is different from Wasabi (I'll come back to this in a second), but supporting our on-site Unix installations routinely took 20% of our entire FogBugz dev team, and, at its peak, could take even more. This hurt our development speed, especially compounded with our lower resources.\n\nHere are some issues that had nothing to do with why FogBugz lost in the market place:\n\n  1. **FogBugz was not a focused product.** Most Atlassian shops use JIRA and Confluence; FogBugz bundles both. This is a sales strategy, not a technical one.\n  2. **No partner ecosystem.** We had a partner ecosystem. Plugins could be written in any .NET-using language. We'd even host them and run them on our servers, and we even had fairly good developer uptake for a very long time (e.g. Balsamiq, time tracking, Kanban boards, etc).\n  3. **Wasabi**. If we hadn't done Wasabi, then we'd have had to rewrite all of FogBugz, and that would've killed the company. Wasabi also gave us stuff that developers are only now rediscovering, like code that executes on both client and server (e.g. via server-side/client-side React), that even gave us a development edge. I've written about this at length (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9779133) and won't revisit it, but while I think that Wasabi _targeting .NET_ may have been a mistake, _Wasabi_ itself was not a mistake.\n\n### Comment ID cvkmd2v with +167 score by [(carlfish, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkmd2v/) (in reply to ID cvkf1gp):\nI worked at Atlassian from 2003-2014. Even before I worked at Atlasssian I was a faithful reader of Joel on Software. So I thought I might provide a counterpoint. It's interesting how different a company seems to look from the outside than it was from the inside.\n\n(Although obviously none of what follows is secret insider knowledge, it's all stuff that the company has been pretty open about in the press.)\n\n**We didn't have a sales team.**\n\nWhat Atlasssian's called its ”pre-sales” team was entirely reactive. If you called them they'd have someone who could answer your questions about what the products did, but that was about it. If you asked them for a deal or a discount because you were a big company, they'd politely direct you back to the pricing page on our website. After-sales there was an advocacy team who would occasionally call random customers to ask what we could be doing better, and who would email to remind you your maintenance was about to expire. \n\nThat's basically it. Nobody was out there drinking with CTOs or trying to \"build relationships\" to get sales.\n\nAtlasssian's strategy for large companies was that they are really just lots of small companies that happen to share an office: making sure the low-end of the products were cheap enough that a low-end manager could buy them without asking her boss for permission, and installable on that spare dev box in the corner so they didn't have to get IT involved. In our experience, once one or two small teams inside a company had bought JIRA or Confluence, the products would spread virally to the rest of the company without us really having to do anything but make good software.\n\n**The VC is a red herring.**\n\nAtlasssian, and JIRA especially, was profitable from day one. If there was a single year after 2002 where making JIRA cost more than it was earning, I'd be very surprised. The main reason Atlasssian took VC was because the staff (and I'm guessing the founders) were starting to say it would be kind of nice if the stock options everyone had were worth something one day. Once the VC was taken, most of the money was spent broadening the company's product line: the products that already existed were happily paying for themselves.\n\nAs a sign of how little Atlassian needed the money, the second round of investment didn't go to the company at all - it was entirely staff being given a chance to sell some of their options.\n\nWhich is all a moot point because JIRA was already way ahead of Fogbugz in the marketplace before Atlasssian took funding in 2010.\n\n**Anyway**\n\nAnyway, here's my take on the story. I don't think Fogbugz \"lost\". FogBugz is a successful product that many people love, calling that \"losing\" is pretty insulting to be honest. I think the companies just built different products for different markets, and one market turned out to be larger than the other.\n\nFor the _vital first five years_, JIRA and Fogbugz had diametrically opposed product strategies. Fogbugz was a tightly focused product that eschewed customization in favor of presenting how Fog Creek believed an issue tracker would provide the most benefit for a team of developers. JIRA from day one wanted to be all things to all people: there was no deeper strategy than \"listen to what our customers want and give it to them.\"\n\nSo as Fog Creek got this base of loyal customers who bought into the product's vision, Atlasssian got… everyone else. And everyone else was more people. \n\nWhich is kind of the opposite of what the OP article says. JIRA wasn't \"more focused\". JIRA was so flexible customers were already inventing workflows and custom fields so it could be deployed as a service desk, as a support system, as a legal compliance tool, as an HR/recruiting system and a million other things that surprised the hell out of us when we found out. My wife's favorite example (she ran support in the US, that's how we met) was the dating site that had a \"MARRIED\" resolution in their JIRA instance.\n\nBy the time Fog Creek realized that [the wheels _weren't_ going to fall off the Atlassian donkey cart](http://www.inc.com/magazine/20091101/does-slow-growth-equal-slow-death.html), and deviating from that product vision was a necessary compromise for people threatening to \"[GO OVER TO THE AUSTRALIANS](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/07/20.html)\", the network effect had already set in and they were playing catch-up in the market. Unfortunately, that realization coincided almost exactly with when Atlassian introduced those $10 starter licenses.\n\n#### Comment ID cvknpbd with +66 score by [(gecko, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvknpbd/) (in reply to ID cvkmd2v):\nThanks for the response! I think we're actually agreeing more than disagreeing.\n\nI still think what you're describing as pre-sales counts as a sales team. Fog Creek didn't have a real equivalent; sometimes support would answer questions, and sometimes our SMTPs (management training program), and sometimes developers, and sometimes our office manager, but it was easy for us to lose you/not follow up sanely. Having a person to contact, even if it's purely reactive, counts as sales--especially because, as a developer who wants my company to buy `$foo`, it gives me someone's name and contact info to give my boss. Once we added sales staff (both reactive and outreach), **because we realized we were losing sales to your pre-sales team**, our sales went up, but that happened relatively late in those first five years. So, I hear you, but I still think you're undervaluing what Atlassian was doing there.\n\nVC does indeed sound like it's a red herring; I didn't know that. And I agree that FC's straight-up refusal to implement features was a problem (see my note on agile in my original post).\n\nI did forget another thing though, which actually is another side of both that point and my original post: Atlassian segmented their products like nobody's business. FogBugz was just FogBugz (and later optionally Kiln) so that you'd have just one single thing to decide on, but that corresponded to JIRA + Confluence + Greenhopper (theoretically, anyway), + Crucible + FishEye. Five separate times Atlassian could charge a customer, each of which could individually be cheaper than FogBugz. Five separate solutions that Atlassian could *independently* offer to a potential client, or bundle together. Fog Creek just had FogBugz as a monolithic thing.\n\nThat had two effects: we couldn't do margin pricing, and we didn't know what features actually sold things. Atlassian had neither of these problems, making it easier for them to do whatever, and to make more money doing it.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the clarification.\n\n#### Comment ID cvkuhgv with +8 score by [(okmkz, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkuhgv/) (in reply to ID cvkmd2v):\n> dating site that had a \"MARRIED\" resolution in their JIRA instance\n\nThis is amazing.

The GC was conservative non-compacting, the standard library had tons of bugs and omissions, there were major issues with multithreaded programs, debugging was a chore, and more. (I'm sorry I'm vague on this one, but it's been at least six years at this point.) We ended up having our own FogBugz fork of Mono that fixed bugs in ways specific to FogBugz and that filled in library functions exactly enough that FogBugz could get work done. (We did submit some of this upstream, but IIRC it was usually rejected precisely because it was incomplete.)\n \n(I argued at the time that we should target Java, but Fog Creek had *much* more institutional knowledge of the .NET stack, so the thought was that patching/supporting Mono would be easier than using Java, IIRC. I didn't agree at the time, but it wasn't obvious that I was necessarily right, either. I think we also considered Python. And all of these options were in turn only possible due to Wasabi, incidentally, without which we'd have been stuck on ASP 3.)\n\nThe secondary issue was indeed just how many things there were to target. To support Windows, we had to test on Windows 2000, Windows 2003 x86, and Windows 2003 x64. Period. To support \"Unix\", we had to test on RHEL (later also CentOS), Solaris, OS X, Debian (later also Ubuntu), OpenSuSE, and more, usually in both x86 and x64 variants (and I'm pretty sure UltraSPARC for the Solaris port, based on the Sun Stations we had for a long time). These also all needed custom installer scripts, and could have custom issues due to various Linux kernel patches being applied or not applied, various packages having or not having certain bug fixes, and so on. We ultimately solved this by bundling our own copies of Apache, Mono, etc., if I recall correctly, and jamming the whole concoction under `/opt`, so at least we'd have the same versions and bugs everywhere.\n\nEDIT: Grammar, and removed a redundant phrase or two that had redundancies.\n\n#### Comment ID cvkjoow with +16 score by [(AlpineCoder, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkjoow/) (in reply to ID cvkfd0n):\n> What do you think the root cause of this was?\n\nI worked at a place that had an \"on-site\" FogBugz installation.

I've since moved into linux kernel development and other low level systems stuff that would have been impossible to work on there.\n\nIn general I always felt that Fog Creek was remarkably effective in hiring great engineers, but the work to do was a little easy (fixing css for old versions of IE doesn't require top minds) so they'd do crazy stuff (transpiling, wasabi, etc.) to keep people entertained.\n\nIIRC, the offers at the time were also pretty financially underwhelming -- Facebook and Google were both paying way more and most of the interns who received offers ultimately ended up at FB or Google instead (like 4 of my co-interns worked at FB with me, and there were 10 of us in total).\n\nThere was also some internship funkiness.  For some reason they had this policy of not telling people when they wouldn't be getting job offers, which was crazy because you could clearly see that other people /were/ getting job offers (Glass doors on the offices).

You find a good tool, put it on the company credit card, and perhaps even convince your teammates to use it. But in company with hundreds or thousands of developers? Each team might use their favourite tools... until a high-level manager decides to standardise on something else for \"more synergy\".

I use and prefer JIRA to FogBugz, but I've worked in plenty of places that still use FogBugz, and while it feels a bit out of date, it's not unsalvageable.\n\nWith that being said, I think the only way for FogBugz to regain its foothold is for a rebuild, and that largely goes against one of Spolsky's beliefs. Fog Creek *could* create a competitive JIRA replacement with current technology, but I don't think it can be built on top of FogBugz without significant work.\n\nAnyone that uses Atlassian tools is well aware that their tools work, but they often lack polish. One only needs to see the difference in BitBucket and GitHub to see an example of this. If someone can enter the market, nail all the basics that Atlassian does well, AND provide the extras that Atlassian cannot do quickly they'll pick up loads of users.\n\n## Comment ID cvkcjyl with +31 score by [(badsectoracula, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkcjyl/) (in reply to ID 3n2sc1):\n> 3. Wasabi\n\nIIRC Wasabi was made back in early 2000s when they wanted to actually *sell* the software to clients who already had an infrastructure of either using PHP, (classic) ASP or some other incompatible web tech and didn't want to rewrite the software in every language so instead they wrote their own meta-compiler for that. Also IIRC Wasabi was a VBScript superset and at the time it was made, VBScript was popular (via classic ASP) enough to be able to find programmers who would learn it easily. And TBH i doubt any half-decent programmer would be unable to learn a new scripting language. It might take a couple extra days but unless they did something total alien, it'll most likely look and behave like one or two languages most programmers have already used.\n\nI'd guess that at the time they made it, being able to support all sorts of otherwise incompatible systems was an advantage for them.\n\nThe Haxe programming language does exactly that: provides a base language that can be \"compiled\" to other languages, such as PHP, Java, C#, C++, JavaScript, etc. Of course Haxe was made several years later.\n\n### Comment ID cvkddg1 with +35 score by [(None, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkddg1/) (in reply to ID cvkcjyl):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID cvkmgx2 with +1 score by [(nullabillity, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkmgx2/) (in reply to ID cvkddg1):\n> But on a platform like Haxe or Wasabi that would require that the target languages support extensions too. \n\nNot quite, if you can translate the theoretical language ExHaxe to Java then you ought to be able to translate it to Haxe too, unless it depends on the platform runtime.\n\n#### Comment ID cvlx9c2 with +1 score by [(badsectoracula, Reddit, 2015-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvlx9c2/) (in reply to ID cvkddg1):\n> But on a platform like Haxe or Wasabi that would require that the target languages support extensions too.\n\nI don't know about Wasabi, but generally Haxe is much richer as a language than the targets it supports.

But that's not the issue. The issues are:\n\n- you spend 10% of your time looking at a loading spinner (I get 1-2.5mb page loads on *every link* - if there's one thing that would benefit from drinking the SPA kool-aid, it's JIRA)\n- you spend 70% of your time looking for where they've hidden the very simple thing you need to do\n- you spend 10% of your time refreshing the browser when more than one person is moving things about at once\n- you spend 8% of the time marvelling at the inconsistencies in the UX design (you can drag to reorder stories in the backlog, you can't do so to reorganise sub-tasks on the story view, and a million other things)\n- with the remaining 2%, you very occasionally get something done.\n\nJira is where UI design goes to die.

If you can spend $10/employee to get even a 1% productivity increase, it's unbelievably worth it\n\nCompanies aren't price sensitive at those numbers, even smaller ones.\n\n### Comment ID cvkg6af with +11 score by [(miyakohouou, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkg6af/) (in reply to ID cvkfdrm):\nMy experience is that what you are saying makes perfect rational sense, and I've never been in an environment where it's true.  Getting access to hardware and software has always been like pulling teeth, sure it might make your employees more efficient, but their salaries are already \"spent money\" so why not just make them go through a few extra steps to save money.  Besides, software and salary are different colors of money, and so you can't compare them fairly anyway.

      "# Post ID jj1efi: Is Gitlab a suitable \"Atlassian Suite\" replacement? with +23 score by [(guernica88, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/)\nAs a company we deal with ITAR controlled data and therefor cannot use the majority of cloud based products. This includes Atlassian cloud products which is why we've been using their onprem products. Obviously they've announced a discontinuation of those products.\n\nSo I'm looking into suitable replacements and Gitlab has caught my eye. I have a couple of questions that I thought might be easier answered by the community though as we aren't only working on software in the system.\n\n1. Confluence? We use confluence to host several sections. Some groups use it to develop their procedures and helpful tips. Our sysadmin use it as a \"Knowledgebase\" where they store lots of articles they've written for themselves on how to deal with tricky hardware or very specialized equipment. They also have things like onboarding and offboarding procedures in there\n\n2. General ticketing system. We use the ticketing system in Jira for everything. Our sysadmin tickets go through here as well as our engineers have tickets in here. These two portions are completely devoid of any code and make no use of repositories. Will we be able to setup ticketing \"sections\" for these that follow a workflow. Workflow is very important to our engineers and they can be somewhat complicated moving from status to status and needing certain qualifications to be able to move to next steps.\n\n3. Those are the two big ones, but beyond that I see that there is supported migration from Jira to GitLab so I was wondering if anyone comments on their experience moving from Atlassian Suite to Gitlab. The three main products we use are Jira, Confluence, Fisheye and Bitbucket.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read!\n\n## Comment ID ga9w13d with +11 score by [(tehBarrow, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/ga9w13d/) (in reply to ID jj1efi):\nYou can replace Bitbucket, Bamboo and possibly JIRA with GitLab (and sort of fisheye then). Replacing JIRA mostly depends on how deep down the rabbit hole you have gone with JIRA, ticketing in GitLab is simpler and it is not possible to configure in the same ways as JIRA can be, this can actually a good thing in the long run.\n\nConfluence is sort of unique and possibly best in class when combined with JIRA, GitLab has pages but that is not really a replacement for Confluence. You can however use GitLab and write knowledge articles in markdown files and place it in a  knowledgebase repository and use some Hugo site template to expose them (via pages), can become pretty nice actually. I have seen many teams create very nice and easily searched KB sites that way.\n\nYou need to have a repo or group for tickets, call one sysadmin or helpdesk and you are fine. Workflow is however non-existent, any ticket can be moved to any column without any stops and tickets do not really have a status. You can use labels to simulate this though.\n\nNo idea on the migration, git is always git, so that should not be an issue.\n\n### Comment ID gaai2bk with +9 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/gaai2bk/) (in reply to ID ga9w13d):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID gaamqzl with +4 score by [(lps2, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/gaamqzl/) (in reply to ID gaai2bk):\nCorrect and the wiki is itself a repo\n\n#### Comment ID gaann6h with +3 score by [(tehBarrow, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/gaann6h/) (in reply to ID gaai2bk):\nYeah, but compared to confluence it is pretty weak.\n\n### Comment ID ga9zutn with +3 score by [(guernica88, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/ga9zutn/) (in reply to ID ga9w13d):\nHmmm no custom workflows for issues may actually be a deal breaker.

If people are treating it like Sharepoint and piling files into it, that didn’t feel as polished. They did improve the storage implementation recently so that should be better. Personally not having to deal with Confluence’s wiki syntax is worth a lot but I’d definitely see what your target users think about it since that’s an easy point of friction.\n\n### Comment ID ga9vz6a with +2 score by [(guernica88, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/ga9vz6a/) (in reply to ID ga9vklc):\nOk looks like Confluence may be where I should focus my research.

      "# Post ID 1841wxq: Atlassian Certification Exam Tips 2023/2024 with +21 score by [(razimandom, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/1841wxq/atlassian_certification_exam_tips_20232024/)\nIf you are seeking tips to pass Atlassian Certifications, you may find this article useful. Having started with no prior knowledge, I successfully passed six ACP exams in three months 2 years ago, and I just passed 4 ACP this month to renew my certifications. I am confident that with the right dedication, you can achieve the same.\n\nMy first ACP exam was ACP-600, and at that time, ACP-620 did not exist. I failed my first test because I had no idea the exam could be so challenging. I don't want you to encounter the same situation, so let's skip the success story part and dive straight into some exam tips.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ACP-620 Exam Tips**\n\nThese tips are designed for those who use Jira as a user, not as an admin. This means you are familiar with basic features such as changing status, adding comments, simple gadgets and reports, and modifying field values. Unfortunately, this knowledge alone may not be sufficient to pass the exam. I recommend considering the Cloud exam as a starting point.\n\nWhether you are Cloud or Data Center users, I recommend starting with ACP-620 because you can run Jira Cloud by yourself without installing Jira DC on your local machine or a cloud server like AWS. [The free version of Jira Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/standard) is sufficient for you to prepare for the exam.\n\nExamine the distinctions between team-managed projects and company-managed projects, as well as between Kanban and Scrum. Consider scenarios in which you would opt for Kanban, Scrum, team-managed projects, or company-managed projects.\n\nExperiment with each gadget and report. Understand the information it presents, as questions will guide you in selecting the suitable type of gadget or report based on specified requirements.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with [company-managed](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/permissions-for-company-managed-projects/) project permissions, paying special attention to the nuanced aspects of permissions related to 'Schedule Issues' and 'Resolve Issues'. Note that these project permissions also impact your ability to view the information in fields such as Due Date and Fix Version. Also, remember that 'Move Issues' permission does not mean you can move your issue's status, but you need 'Transition Issues' permission to change your issue's status.\n\nUtilize all board features such as swimlanes, board filters, board sub-filters, columns, and so on. The exam will ask which features to use based on given requirements.\n\nAtlassian shared very [detailed exam topics](https://university.atlassian.com/student/page/840992-acp-620-managing-jira-cloud-projects-certification) including references, which I highly encourage you to read and understand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ACP-610 Exam Tips**\n\nLet's assume you've successfully completed ACP-620—fantastic! By doing so, you've already acquired 80% of the knowledge required to pass ACP-610. The variations between these two exams lie in the fact that ACP-620 encompasses team-managed and company-managed projects, whereas ACP-610 introduces a distinct project permission for project administrators called Extended Project Permission.\n\nExtended Project Permission grants project administrators in Data Center (DC) a specific level of control over Screens and Workflows. Make sure to understand the range of actions a project administrator can perform under this permission, particularly concerning Screen and Workflow management.\n\nA project administrator without Extended Project Permission cannot edit the project workflow. However, with that permission, they gain the ability to edit it with some restrictions. For instance, they can add a status that has already been created by the Jira administrator, but they cannot create a new status from the workflow editor. It's essential to understand both the capabilities and limitations of what a project administrator can do with this permission. You can read more about this permission in Atlassian documentation ([Managing Project Permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/managing-project-permissions-938847145.html)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Udemy Exam Courses**\n\nIf you find it overwhelming to learn all of this, don't worry. During my preparation for ACP exams, I transformed my study notes into a set of questions in Udemy. If I'm not mistaken, I believe you can get it free if your company has Udemy Business account. Let's take a look at these sample questions from Udemy.\n\n**Sample Udemy Course Questions**\n\n*It is a bit slow to load GIFs on Reddit. You can view 10 sample questions* [*here*](https://udemyatlassian.com/atlassian-certification-exam-tips-2023-2024/)*.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/51z468dk8m2c1.png?width=1760&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9ecdeb3980a7c487446aca2dd7ee54bf6b4a1c9\n\nOn Udemy, you will utilize an exam simulator to acquaint yourself with the actual exam timing. After completing the exam, you can access a comprehensive explanation, link to Atlassian documentation, and GIFs in some questions, to enhance your understanding of the answers.\n\n**Sample Udemy Course Explanation**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m8ybve656m2c1.png?width=1620&format=png&auto=webp&s=47aaa45f8fa40ee5d76a6d4122dad75956fc4872\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**You can check other Udemy courses here:**\n\n* [ACP-620 Jira Cloud Certification Exam Practices 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/jira-cloud-certification-exam-practices-acp-620-managing-jira-projects)\n* [ACP-120 Jira Cloud Certification Exam Practices 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/acp-120-jira-administration-for-cloud)\n* [ACP-610 Jira Data Center Certification Exam Practices 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/acp-610-managing-jira-projects-for-data-center)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm currently working on the ACP-100 course, but it will take some time to complete. This is because it involves additional work to set up LDAP and a Mail server, and testing them in various scenarios. In my experience, ACP-100 is the most challenging certification compared to others.\n\nI wish you the best of luck!\n\n## Comment ID kasujw7 with +2 score by [(mosmani, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/1841wxq/atlassian_certification_exam_tips_20232024/kasujw7/) (in reply to ID 1841wxq):\nThank you million times.\n\n### Comment ID kat1d20 with +2 score by [(razimandom, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/1841wxq/atlassian_certification_exam_tips_20232024/kat1d20/) (in reply to ID kasujw7):\nMy pleasure!\n\n## Comment ID kautn7w with +2 score by [(NamasteWager, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/1841wxq/atlassian_certification_exam_tips_20232024/kautn7w/) (in reply to ID 1841wxq):\nGoing for my expert certs soon, this is going to help a ton.

In my time there, I went through 2 re-orgs and 3 managers. It just always felt like being on a hamster wheel… in a hurricane. Today I received an email 7 weeks after I was laid off that started with, “ Congrats on your first year at Atlassian—we know that's a huge accomplishment and are beyond thrilled to be celebrating with you!” It was a bummer to receive that, to say the least, but it included a link to leave this Glassdoor review to “ help provide invaluable insight to future candidates and help us to improve your experience as an employee continually.” so here I am. My advice is to do proper change management of your automated emails when you layoff 5% of your workforce so that emails like this aren’t sent to hard working former employees that you eliminated congratulating them on a milestone they never reached. I know this wasn’t intentional, but it hurt.",

For example, Engineering EA experience may be vastly different from Sales and Marketing EA - even though all roll up to the same cost center, just different management and oversight. They are working to improve this. The ramp up to onboarding is supposed to be 2-4 weeks before start the role (doing the work) and some get thrown into the fire faster, depending on leader, needs and fires to put out. Recent change in 2025 to benefits sharing, employees will start contributing to health benefits (really cool they didn't used to) but will now have employees take part in costs sharing. Its minimal but still sad to see it go away, but understandable. Travel for EA's can also vary by team and Leaders needs, so this is a bit all over the place.

          "cons": "If you’ve ever wished for a job where you can experience the absolute pinnacle of PIP (Performance Improvement Plan) culture and where your worth is reduced to a mere number of pull requests, then welcome to Atlassian!\n\nLet’s start with the PIP culture. It’s truly an art form here. If you're not on a PIP, are you even really working? The company’s commitment to ensuring everyone feels the thrill of living on the edge is truly admirable. It's like a rite of passage—every month brings a fresh wave of anxiety and excitement. Who needs job security when you can have constant, gut-wrenching uncertainty?\n\nNow, about the PR count. Atlassian has managed to turn code reviews into a competitive sport. Forget about writing clean, functional code. It’s all about the numbers, baby! Your worth here is measured in pull requests like you’re a racehorse on a track. The more, the better, right? Never mind if the quality suffers—what’s important is hitting that next PR milestone. And, oh, the thrill of having your PR comments count scrutinized as if each one were a personal reflection of your professional worth!\n\nAnd let’s not forget the working environment. The long hours and relentless pace make it feel like you’re in a corporate version of The Hunger Games. Survival of the fittest becomes your daily mantra as you navigate through a battlefield of endless tasks and shifting priorities. It’s a test of endurance where every day feels like a quest to avoid the next corporate elimination.\n\nIn summary, if you’re looking for a job where you can feel perpetually on edge, where your every PR is tallied and analyzed, and where the work environment resembles a high-stakes survival game, Atlassian is your dream destination.",

Nobody feels safe about their job.\nAs a senior individual contributor, my performance was meant to be measured in terms of \"impact\", which is only vaguely defined.\nThis translates into senior engineers launching all kinds of useless, or even harmful projects, just so they can claim they made such an impact.\nUnfortunately, I found myself with a clueless manager, who, three months into the job, told me I would have been let go because of \"lack of impact\".\nI wonder what kind of impact he expected in such a short time at a complex company like Atlassian, but he never clarified.\nI tried to prove myself in many ways, but it was never enough, or the right way.\nHe never helped me understand how I could have been more effective. Instead, at every 1-1, he always expressed his disappointment, with no constructive feedback whatsoever.\nOne of their core values is \"Play, as a team\", which is funny, because it should be \"Everyone for themselves\".",

If a project led by an IC is slipping by a week, management make a big fuss about it and expect a mitigation plan ASAP. But, if the “leadership” is a few months late to provide an update we’re only told that “they’re working on it”. The same applies to the company's abrupt transition from extremely aggressive hiring to lay-offs within a two month period, there was no acknowledgement of potential errors that may have occurred. - In the past few months, the executives' tone of voice has shifted to somewhat passive-aggressive. Sure, it’s difficult macroeconomic conditions, but there’s better ways to communicate that we need to switch strategy. At least for the organisation that Atlassian was aspiring to be. - A lot of toxic positivity, especially from the middle managers. Every re-org is celebrated like it was the the best decision ever. It's especially annoying with more challenging announcements like purging the Development Manager role. - Your career and overall well-being are heavily dependent on your direct manager. If you're fortunate, you have the potential to advance significantly, but if you're unlucky, you'll experience a burnout. And too many good people have become miserable because of bad managers at Atlassian. It’s basically impossible to escalate a conflict with your manager.",

Back then, there were more support on our wellbeing, for example providing COVID special leave and additional recharge days. People that I worked with were welcoming and truly living the Atlassian values.\n\nOvertime, the culture turned backwards, no more recharge days and they introduced more and more performance metrics to measure us against each other. People are more anxious and in a race to increase their PR counts. There is also a strong focus on proving your individual contributions, hence we need to constantly collect evidences on our work and impact. All of this combine leads to a never ending burn out. \n\nIf you already in a job that you enjoy and considering Atlassian, I would advise to really rethink if the salary and advertised benefits are really worth your mental health. Also the benefit policies are constantly changing, so they might not be as great in the coming future.",

After more than eight years with the company, it's disheartening to witness such a decline. The new rating system is unfair, downgrading employees despite their hard work. Unless you're working 25(yes 25)/7, you won't receive a decent rating, you aren't demonstrating much 'Org impact.'\n\nBeing a woman in tech is challenging, but being a mother in tech is even tougher. Despite the generous maternity leave policy, many new mothers, including myself, have received unfair poor performance reviews, leading many to leave the company. During my time here, I've experienced over three reorganizations and countless white male managers. When I finally had a manager who supported my goals for promotion, they were let go.\n\nWe’ve become worse than Meta, preaching admirable values but living in a 'Hunger Games' environment. At least with Meta, you know what to expect. The pressure to merge a certain number of PRs affects both performance evaluations and mental health. With everyone rushing to merge PRs, it's an incredibly stressful race—ironic for a company that preaches work-life balance. Asking for help in public channels often leads to management questioning your abilities; I’ve seen it happen repeatedly. Bringing concerns to HR feels like talking into the void. Lastly, We used to have free insurance, but now that benefit is going away. I used to love working here, but now I dread every day.",

Today I received an email 7 weeks after I was laid off that started with, “ Congrats on your first year at Atlassian—we know that's a huge accomplishment and are beyond thrilled to be celebrating with you!” It was a bummer to receive that, to say the least, but it included a link to leave this Glassdoor review to “ help provide invaluable insight to future candidates and help us to improve your experience as an employee continually.” so here I am. My advice is to do proper change management of your automated emails when you layoff 5% of your workforce so that emails like this aren’t sent to hard working former employees that you eliminated congratulating them on a milestone they never reached.

Sure, it’s difficult macroeconomic conditions, but there’s better ways to communicate that we need to switch strategy. At least for the organisation that Atlassian was aspiring to be. - A lot of toxic positivity, especially from the middle managers. Every re-org is celebrated like it was the the best decision ever. It's especially annoying with more challenging announcements like purging the Development Manager role. - Your career and overall well-being are heavily dependent on your direct manager.

With everyone rushing to merge PRs, it's an incredibly stressful race—ironic for a company that preaches work-life balance.

      "# [hyperlink in jira automation by community.atlassian.com, user-id on 2022-07-08](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/hyperlink-in-jira-automation/qaq-p/2074366)\nHi There, I'm trying to use jira automation to automatically input a link in a JSM issue when certain conditions are met. This in my case is placing a reference document on a related ticket. Right now the link is viewable and is clickable, but it shows the full URL for a confluence page which is looooong and I would like this to look similar to what you can do with an HREF tag in HTML. Is there a way to do this using jira automation?\n\n<a href=\"url\">link text</a>",
      "# [Atlassian Cloud changes Jul 29 to Aug 5, 2024](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/blog/2024/08/atlassian-cloud-changes-jul-29-to-aug-5-2024)\nThese changes have recently been rolled out to Atlassian Cloud sites.\n\nChanges labeled ROLLING OUT are being gradually rolled out and may not be on your site just yet.\n\nAtlassian Administration\n\nAtlassian Administration is where you manage your Atlassian organization, including user access to products, security settings, and billing preferences.\n\nChoose to get Atlassian experiments for your organization\n\nROLLING OUT NEW THIS WEEK\n\nExperiments are Atlassian changes in development. We gather data on these changes to determine if they’re ready to release to all organizations.\n\nFor organizations with an Enterprise plan, you can choose to get experiments so you can influence Atlassian's product development through testing. Or prevent experiments rolling out to your organization because you need to ensure changes are planned for ahead of time.\n\nLearn about Atlassian experiments\n\nFilter the user list with added roles\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve updated the users list in the Atlassian Administration Directory. You can now filter the user list by new roles that have been split into multiple dropdown menus instead of one.\n\nThe roles we’re introducing include:\n\nCompass basic\n\nJira Service Management stakeholder and customer\n\nJira Product Discovery contributor\n\nTo filter the user list by roles:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Directory > Users.\n\nFrom the Role field, select the role you’d like to filter by.\n\nThis change only applies to user list filters for centralized user management. Learn more about the centralized user management\n\nMake it easy and secure for customers to log in to your help center with single sign-on\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you connect an identity provider to your Jira Service Management site, you can authenticate your customers with SAML single sign-on (SSO).\n\nBefore you begin\n\nYou must subscribe to Atlassian Access from your organization before you set up SAML single sign-on. Learn more about how to start with Atlassian Access\n\nTo set up SAML SSO for portal-only customers:\n\nGo to Settings > Products.\n\nUnder Jira Service Management, select Authentication.\n\nSelect Add identity provider.\n\nFollow the prompts to complete the setup.\n\nLearn more about SAML single sign-on for portal-only customers\n\nBrand your Jira products with a custom domain\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now use custom domains to brand your Jira products. Custom domains provide easy-to-remember URLs for your users to access your products.\n\nYou can create a custom domain if you have a Jira Premium or Jira Service Management Standard plan.\n\nPreviously, this feature was only available for Jira Service Management help center. Tell me more about custom domains\n\nTo create a custom domain:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Products > Product URLs.\n\nSelect Add custom domain. This is only visible if you have an eligible product.\n\nReview the Before you add a custom domain page, and select Next.\n\nSelect which product you want to access from your custom domain.\n\nFollow the prompts to specify your domain. You’ll need to enter two subdomains and a domain.\n\nEnter a Redirect URL. This is optional.\n\nReview changes and select Create domain.\n\nConnect Microsoft Azure AD to Atlassian with an option that works for you\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you connect your Microsoft Azure AD identity provider to an Atlassian organization, you now have two options.\n\nOption 1: Manually set up user provisioning\n\nRecommended when you need:\n\nflexibility in setting up your Microsoft Azure Active Directory identity provider with SCIM and SAML\n\nto sync groups and users with no flattening of nested group structure\n\nto sync when you add users to your Azure AD\n\nLearn how to add an identity provider for this option\n\nOption 2: Automatically set up user provisioning\n\nRecommended when you need:\n\neasy set up by allowing access to groups and users in your Microsoft Azure Active Directory\n\nto flatten your nested group structure and keep group memberships\n\nto sync automatically (every 4 hours)\n\nLearn more about Azure AD for nested groups\n\nTo connect your identity provider:\n\n1. Go to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\n2. Select Security > Identity providers.\n\nLearn more about identity providers\n\nFind Atlassian Administration settings faster\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now avoid searching every page of the Atlassian administration looking for what you need. We’ve added a new search field. From this field, you can enter a top or left navigation page title and select the page you want from the results.\n\nTo use the Administration search field:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect the search field in the top right.\n\nEnter the page title.\n\nSelect the page you want.\n\nRetiring the possibility to manage the atlassian-addons-project-access role\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nFollowing up on our previous announcement, we’re planning to remove the possibility to manage the atlassian-addons-project-access role in two to six months. The exact date depends on the feedback we receive after this announcement.\n\nBy default, the role is assigned to all project permissions in permission schemes and all issue security levels in issue security schemes. As a result of this change, the possibility to manage that role’s permissions and issue security levels, both via the UI and the REST API, will be restricted.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the planned changes, please leave them under this public ticket.\n\nCreate custom domains for your Jira products\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe removed keyword restrictions when you create custom domains. You will no longer have a fixed list to select keywords for subdomains. Instead, you have the ability to manually enter your own subdomains.\n\nJira family products have also been given added support. You can now select Jira products from the dropdown menu when you create a custom domain.\n\nTo create a custom domain:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Products > Product URLs.\n\nSelect Add custom domain. This is only visible if you have an eligible product.\n\nReview the Before you add a custom domain page, and select Next.\n\nSelect which product you want to access from your custom domain.\n\nFollow the prompts to specify your domain. You’ll need to enter two subdomains and a domain.\n\nEnter a Redirect URL. This is optional.\n\nReview changes and select Create domain.\n\nData residency for Marketplace apps\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen evaluating data residency for your apps, you might see some apps listed as \"No action available.\"\n\nThis means that some app partners declare that their apps don't need to be pinned or migrated because their apps exclusively store data within the Atlassian product. Another reason is that the apps may not store any data in the scope of the Marketplace partner's data residency policies.\n\nTo request a data residency move for your apps, you will have first to move your product. Learn more about how to move your product from one location to another\n\nOnce your product has been pinned to your selected location, you can move your eligible apps to the same location. Learn more about data residency for Marketplace apps\n\nStay on top of your organization’s security\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe improved the security guide so you can see your security setup in one place.\n\nUnderstand your organization’s mix of users and their login methods at a glance. Then, review your security recommendations to keep your users and data protected.\n\nTo go to the security guide:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security.\n\nCopy Confluence data: Move users related to spaces you want to copy\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you move data from one instance of your Confluence cloud to another, you can move spaces, and only users who contribute to the spaces.\n\nThis means that when you add or reorganize teams, you can move spaces and only the related users you want, instead of all users. This will help you copy data:\n\nin small chunks\n\nin multiple phases\n\nquicker and reduce your overall downtime.\n\nTo access this feature:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Settings > Copy product data.\n\nSelect Create copy plan.\n\nOn the How it works page, select Next.\n\nSelect your source and destination.\n\nSelect the spaces you want to copy.\n\nOn the Copy users and groups page, select Copy users and groups related to the selected spaces from the Users and groups section.\n\nBrand Confluence with a custom domain\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now use custom domains to brand Confluence. Custom domains provide easy-to-remember URLs for your users to access your products.\n\nYou can create a custom domain if you have a Confluence Premium plan.\n\nPreviously, this feature was only available for Jira family of products and Jira Service Management help center. Tell me more about custom domains\n\nTo create a custom domain:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Products > Product URLs.\n\nSelect Add custom domain.

Through customers' feedback, we've heard that when these workflows are opened in the new editor view, they're often hard to read, misaligned, and generally not nice.\n\nTo solve this, we’ve updated how the global transitions and the status lozenges render in the new editor view. See the image for a before/after comparison.\n\nOther small but mighty changes to the workflow editor include:\n\nCollapsable transition labels in the New Workflow Editor\n\nNew shared transitions in the New Workflow Editor for company-managed projects\n\nRead our community post about these changes to learn more.\n\nTemplate recommendations in your Projects directory have a new home\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you click on ‘Projects’ in your top navigation in Jira you land in your Projects directory.

It's now a focused discovery page with a centralized hub for admins to effortlessly discover and install first-party (1P) and third-party (3P) integrations.\n\nThis change means the page will no longer serve its previous function of managing connected tools and opsgenie teams. We've also removed the Edit connections button from the \"Code\" page that previously linked to the \"Toolchain\" page.\n\nIf you need to manage security containers, head to the “Security” page in Jira. From there, you can utilize the connection manager sidebar.\n\nFinally, we've introduced a new Swap container button on the \"On-call\" page. This button replaces the Change connected Opsgenie team button.\n\nImproved search using summary and description fields\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re boosting performance in the issue navigator by changing how the search field works behind the scenes. When using the search field, results will be based on the Summary and Description fields.\n\nBefore this change, results were based on multiple text fields such as Summary, Description, Comments, and any custom text fields, which caused results to be slower to load.\n\nIf you’d prefer to search using text fields, select More + to view additional field filters, then select Text.\n\nTo try it out, head to the issue navigator by going to your project, then select Issues in the sidebar.\n\nNew ways to edit card covers\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNow you can easily choose a color or an attachment, or upload a new card cover.\n\nSelect the action menu on the bottom right and choose \"Edit cover\"\n\nBulk edit issues in Jira list\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nBulk edit up to 1000 issues at one time from your Jira list.\n\nTo bulk edit multiple issues:\n\nSelect multiple issues from your list using the issue checkboxes.\n\nOnce you’ve chosen the issues you’d like to edit, select Edit from the toolbar that appears.\n\nA sidebar will open which allows you to make edits for the shared fields across your selected issues.\n\nView even more issue information from your Jira list\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nView project, groups, cascading select, radio buttons, resolution, and status category information as field columns.\n\nTo view your new fields, scroll the list all the way to the right.

You can pick a whiteboard or a page.\n\nCreate multiple help centers on your site to serve different audiences\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nCreate multiple help centers on your Jira Service Management site and customize each of them for your various teams or audiences.

And if you ever want to see how many more than 1000 that is, then simply select the 1000+ and it'll update to show the full object count. Simple huh? Happy Assets-ing!\n\nGet notified when your issues transition to another status\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIn team-managed projects, users can now receive a separate email when an issue transitions to a different status.\n\nPreviously, users in team-managed projects received the same email regardless of whether an issue was edited or transitioned to another status.\n\nProject admins can now enable a separate email to notify their team when an issue is transitioned. This provides more granular control about email notifications and reduces clutter for users who are only interested in issue transitions.\n\nTo enable email notifications to users when an issue is transitioned:\n\nFrom your project’s sidebar, select Project settings and then Notifications.\n\nSelect Add notification.\n\nUsing the dropdown, search for and select the issue event An issue is updated by a workflow transition (generic event).\n\nSelect the users and roles that will receive this notification.\n\nSelect Add.\n\nMore about customizing notifications in team-managed projects\n\nSmall change to the Automation audit log - we've updated the look and feel of the date picker to make it easier to use.\n\nTo check it out:\n\nNavigate to automation:\n\nFor Confluence automation, go to Confluence settings > Automation\n\nFor Jira automation, go to Jira settings > System > Global automation\n\nSelect Audit log.\n\nSelect Status and choose which statuses you want to filter by.\n\nUse Confluence templates in pages you create in Jira\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you create a Confluence page from a Jira issue, you now have a choice of templates to add to your page.\n\nFrom the Jira issue's drop-down menu, select Create and choose Page.

Cloud-to-cloud migration can help you combine data between two or more cloud sites, split a cloud site into multiple cloud sites, duplicate a cloud site, or move specific projects from one cloud site to another.\n\nOrg and site admins can access this feature by logging in to the cloud site you want to move your users and projects from, then going to Settings > System > Migrate cloud site.\n\nThe new global issue create experience is enabled for all instances\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve modernized and optimized the experience to create issues to make it fast and scalable. Note that you won’t be able to switch back to the old experience.\n\nUse the GitHub for Jira app to connect GitHub Enterprise, instead of DVCS\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nJira admins making a new GitHub connection for a new organisation now need to install the GitHub for Jira app. The app functions just like the DVCS Connector, but with better security features and improved performance.\n\nThis only applies to new GitHub connections in new organisations. Existing connections using DVCS are not affected.\n\nLearn more about the GitHub for Jira app.\n\nControl what you see in your products\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nProduct recommendations now have controls, so now you can dismiss them or learn more about why you’re seeing them. These controls are being added to the recommendations in the app switcher menu which means you'll have more control and receive better product recommendations.\n\nYou can select the three dots next to the recommendation to learn why we have recommended it or to dismiss it entirely.\n\nThe recommendation controls will first be released to both Free and Standard teams of up to 50 users. Note: Only admins will be able to add a new product by clicking on the recommendation.\n\nRetiring the possibility to manage the atlassian-addons-project-access role\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nFollowing up on our previous announcement, we’re planning to remove the possibility to manage the atlassian-addons-project-access role in two to six months. The exact date depends on the feedback we receive after this announcement.\n\nBy default, the role is assigned to all project permissions in permission schemes and all issue security levels in issue security schemes. As a result of this change, the possibility to manage that role’s permissions and issue security levels, both via the UI and the REST API, will be restricted.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the planned changes, please leave them under this public ticket.\n\nOrganize and track work against Compass software components\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now link issues to Compass components from any company-managed Jira Software project.\n\nThis helps your team organize and track work in Jira against elements of your software architecture cataloged in Compass – so you can understand the impact of that work; prioritize work more effectively; and find the information you need to get that work done faster.\n\nLearn more about Compass components\n\nSwitch to Compass components (project admins)\n\nIn your project sidebar, select Components.\n\nCheck that Compass components are turned on.

We’ll create a personalized Create issue form for each issue type and project.\n\nAll the fields you don’t use will be hidden in a More fields section, so you'll always be able to interact with them. The feature is continuously learning. If we notice you using a previously unused field, we’ll pull it out of the More fields section for the next time.\n\nWe’ll automatically turn on the feature to hide unused fields when creating issues, but you can manage it by heading to Personal settings and finding to the Jira labs section.

The exact date depends on the feedback we receive after this announcement.\n\nBy default, the role is assigned to all project permissions in permission schemes and all issue security levels in issue security schemes. As a result of this change, the possibility to manage that role’s permissions and issue security levels, both via the UI and the REST API, will be restricted.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the planned changes, please leave them under this public ticket.\n\nUse filters to search and display Jira issues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNow you can use filters to search for Jira issues and display them in a list, without leaving the Confluence page.\n\nThis improvement follows the release that allows you to search for issues using keywords or JQL, and flexibility to add, remove, and reorder fields.\n\nHow to display Jira issues in a list\n\nStart using filters to search for Jira issues:\n\nEdit a Jira description or comment.\n\nType /jira and select Jira issues.\n\nWith Basic selected, use the filters to search by Project, Type, Status, or Assignee.\n\nSelect Insert issues.\n\nThis will display your selected issues in a list format you can interact with.\n\nTo edit your list of Jira issues:\n\nSelect anywhere on the list.\n\nSelect the Edit button (left-most icon) from the menu that appears at the bottom of the table.\n\nEdit your search query using Basic or JQL.\n\nSelect Insert issues.\n\nFilter results dashboard gadget improvements\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThe gadget now displays issues in the same way as they appear in the issue navigator.

Read more about Atlassian Intelligence features.\n\nAtlassian Intelligence groups related alerts and offers insightful suggestions, helping your team manage alerts and resolve issues more effectively. Alert grouping lessens 'alert fatigue' for your on-call agents. Rather than dealing with each alert separately, they can view a collective summary of similar alerts through an alert group. Over time, Atlassian Intelligence learns to recognize new alerts, identify patterns, and improve grouping based on user feedback.\n\nTo use the alert grouping feature, make sure that your organization admin has activated Atlassian Intelligence from Atlassian Administration. To access the feature, go to the Alerts page and switch to AI view. This works only if you’re using the new alerting feature that's natively available in Jira Service Management.\n\nRead more about alert grouping\n\nThe team field in Jira issues now shows the team icon\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nPreviously, selecting the team field in an issue would prompt a search displaying the singular \"Person\" icon.

Find the comment section, and start creating an internal note. Then, select the Comment visibility button. Select which group or project role you’d like to restrict this comment to. Now, save your comment.\n\nOnly the comment creator and users added to the selected group or project role will see this comment once it’s saved, meaning you can continue to work knowing your confidential request information will stay private to you and your team.\n\nFind out more about project roles in Jira Service Management, or learn how to create and manage your groups.\n\nCalendar view for new Jira Service Management projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re excited to launch a new view of issues in Jira Service Management: calendar view!

There are three ways to get to your personal space:\n\nSelect Spaces in the global navigation bar. Your personal space is automatically starred for easy access.\n\nSelect your profile icon at the top right of the global navigation bar and select Personal Space.\n\nSelect Home in the global navigation bar. All starred spaces are shown on the right.\n\nLearn more about personal spaces\n\nTransfer of page ownership between users\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen a page is created, the person who creates is now known as the owner of that page. We've made it possible for page owners to transfer ownership of their page to another person at any time. Space and site admins can also transfer page ownership from one user to another.\n\nThis way, if a current page owner leaves a project, team, or company, ownership of the page can then be granted to whomever is most appropriate, and maintenance and validity of the page remains fresh.\n\nA page owner is the ‘point person’ for a given page and their name appears in the byline, under the page title.\n\nLearn more about page ownership and how it can be transferred\n\nControl what you see in your products\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nProduct recommendations now have controls, so now you can dismiss them or learn more about why you’re seeing them. These controls are being added to the recommendations in the app switcher menu which means you'll have more control and receive better product recommendations.\n\nYou can select the three dots next to the recommendation to learn why we have recommended it or to dismiss it entirely.\n\nThe recommendation controls will first be released to both Free and Standard teams of up to 50 users. Note: Only admins will be able to add a new product by clicking on the recommendation.\n\nTemplate suggestions in the page editor\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen creating a new page, you start off with popular templates featured first.\n\nOnce you begin adding a title to the page, these featured templates will be replaced by suggested templates: templates that may be a better match for your needs based on the title you entered.\n\nCreate a new page.\n\nStart typing a page title.\n\nRecommendations of popular templates will be replaced by suggested templates, based on the title you've entered.\n\nHome has a new look\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nJump into work with Confluence Home, now with an improved look and feel. This visual refresh includes layout and iconography updates.\n\nVisit Home to see these changes.\n\nUse Confluence databases to organize and connect work\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nConfluence databases will be generally available to everyone over the coming weeks. Use databases to structure, connect, and manage your work.\n\nOrganize information with structured fields, connect your work with real-time syncing across databases and pages, and visualize information using layouts and custom views.\n\nExplore what's possible with Confluence databases and see how to get started.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've added a small blue dot to the comments icon on the toolbar whenever there are unread comments. Thanks to this dot, it's now easier than ever to know if you have unread comments to address.\n\nBy selecting the icon when the blue dot is present, you'll be able to navigate through your unread comments as the topmost items in the comments panel.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nInline comments anchored to highlighted text can get resolved when that text is changed or deleted during an editing session.

Use whiteboards to collaborate and turn ideas into action, faster than ever before.\n\nWhiteboards are great for collaborative activities, such as brainstorming ideas, running retrospectives, planning out and breaking down work for your team, prioritizing what’s coming next, creating diagrams and flowcharts, and more.\n\nTake advantage of integrations with products like Jira. You’ll be able to turn sticky notes into Jira issues and create relationships between issues.\n\nCompare plans and explore what’s possible with whiteboards.\n\nManage space access in bulk\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdmins can now save a bunch of time and repetitive tasks by adding a single user or group to all spaces on a site (or remove them from all spaces) in one bulk action.\n\nThis can be done for literally all spaces on the site, for all spaces except personal spaces, or exclusively for all personal spaces.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNow, Atlassian Intelligence can summarize page comments for you, making it easier and faster to catch up on important feedback. Just navigate to the bottom of the page, above the first page comment, and select Summarize comments.\n\nNew comments since you last checked? Select the refresh icon to generate a summary that includes all the latest feedback.\n\nIntroducing content generation with richer context\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nGet smarter content creation with the AI-powered features in the Editor!

Now you can send an access request for an admin to review.\n\nThe request will go to the space's creator, who will be notified about it inside Confluence and via email.\n\nAs an admin, you'll be able to review the request and easily add the user to Space permissions and choose which permissions they should have.\n\nAutomatically build automation rules to assign guest users to a space\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdmins can now create automation rules to manage space assignments for guest users.\n\nWe'll show you a prompt to automatically build a rule to assign spaces to new guest users when you assign spaces in three ways:\n\nUsing the dropdown menu next to the guest user's name\n\nUsing the bulk assign screen\n\nSetting a default space for guest users in Global Permissions\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now add comments to images and videos in Confluence Cloud, making collaboration and adding context a breeze. ️\n\nThis update lets you add comments directly to images and videos on your pages. When viewing a page, hover over or focus on an image, and a new comment button will appear. While editing, select the image and use the new comment button in the toolbar.\n\nLike text comments, you can easily add your thoughts and discussions. When a comment is added, a handy icon will appear in the corner of the image, letting you know there's a discussion brewing.\n\nJust a heads up: Inline images can't be commented on yet, and each image or video can only have one comment thread.\n\nSet the default space for new guests\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdmins will now be able to choose a default space for all future guests directly from the Assign guest to a space interface. When assigning a guest to a space, admins will now see a checkbox that lets them use that space as the default space for guests.\n\nConfluence admins navigate to Settings (wheel icon) and select Global Permissions.\n\nSelect the Guests tab.\n\nSelect one or more guests and select + Assign Space.\n\nSelect a space and then check the box next to Set as default space for guests.\n\nSelect Assign.\n\nGet a direct path to the default space for guests\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdmins will now be able to access the default guest space settings in Global permissions directly from the guest request access email.

      "# [New Atlassian certification designations - coming soon! 🎉 by Ree Kent, community.atlassian.com, user-id on 2024-10-03](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Training-Certification-articles/New-Atlassian-certification-designations-coming-soon/ba-p/2830034)\nHello, Training & Certification Community! We understand how eager many of you are to learn about the upcoming replacement for the Atlassian Certified Expert (ACE), so I'm thrilled to share some details about what’s coming.\n\nWe're excited to announce that we are replacing the retired ACE program with new designations for Atlassian Specialists and Atlassian Experts. This new program will create multiple tracks for users and admins to demonstrate advanced proficiency with Atlassian products and solutions by earning and combining related certifications.\n\nWhat makes this new approach truly special is that candidates will have the chance to earn Specialist designations by obtaining Atlassian Certified Associate (ACA) certifications. Additionally, there will still be an Expert designation for those who achieve Atlassian Certified Professional (ACP) certifications.\n\nOur favorite part? The Specialist designations will align with the Atlassian system of work by focusing on areas such as Agile DevOps (ADO), IT Service Management (ITSM), Teamwork foundations, the Atlassian Cloud Platform, and more. This opens up exciting opportunities for growth and recognition for a wider range of roles and teams.\n\nInitial Release\n\nFor the initial release, there will be two paths to earn a designation:\n\nAtlassian Certified Administration Expert - Designation for candidates holding any four of these certifications.\n\nJira Admin for Data Center\n\nJira Admin for Cloud\n\nJira Service Management Project Admin\n\nOrg Admin\n\nJira Project Admin for Data Center\n\nJira Project Admin for Cloud\n\nAtlassian Certified Agile DevOps Specialist - Designation for candidates holding these four certifications that relate to agile DevOps practices using Atlassian solutions.\n\nJira Essentials\n\nBoard Configuration\n\nCloud Foundations\n\nConfluence Essentials\n\nSo when will this be live? The new feature is being actively developed and tested in CertMetrics. The plan is to go live in November 2024, and there will be an additional Community post shared when the designations are available.\n\nHere is a sneak peek at how designations will appear in the candidate portal, in the card and list views.\n\nFAQs\n\nWill additional paths be coming soon? Yes, in fact, the certification team is developing a new ACA for JSM agents to be launched in the coming weeks, which will enable the ITSM Specialist designation to go live soon after.\n\nWill additional certifications be added to the initial two paths? Yes, as the certification catalog grows, there will be additional certifications added to each path.\n\nWhat counts as “holding” a certification? This means that the certification has not reached its suspension (inactive) date. Certifications are valid for 24 months, after which a three-month grace period is provided for renewal before the certification expires. It's important to renew your certification(s) before they suspend to ensure they contribute to your designation(s). For further information on renewing your certification(s), refer to How to Maintain Your Certification.\n\nI hold the ACP-EE certification that was granted to candidates that held the ACE standing in the past; is there any change to that certification? No, you will still hold the ACP-EE certification, and as a reminder, that certification does not expire.\n\nThe Atlassian certification team is excited about these specialized designations, which will enable candidates to earn a higher level of recognition, boost their careers, and prove their broad expertise in Atlassian solutions.",

When using the search field, results will be based on the Summary and Description fields.\n\nBefore this change, results were based on multiple text fields such as Summary, Description, Comments, and any custom text fields, which caused results to be slower to load.\n\nIf you’d prefer to search using text fields, select More + to view additional field filters, then select Text.\n\nTo try it out, head to the issue navigator by going to your project, then select Issues in the sidebar.\n\nNew ways to edit card covers\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNow you can easily choose a color or an attachment, or upload a new card cover.\n\nSelect the action menu on the bottom right and choose \"Edit cover\"\n\nShorter, saveable, downloadable, emailable reports for Assets\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've got a whole bunch of improvements in store for Reports for Assets in this release...

And if you ever want to see how many more than 1000 that is, then simply select the 1000+ and it'll update to show the full object count. Simple huh?

These could be on forms that need to capture a customer’s address, for example. Instead of seeing all possible cities or states, you can make it easier for customers by letting them narrow down their options by selecting a country first.\n\nThis is possible with cascading fields. This new field type lets you create conditional fields with two lists of values: a parent list of values and a child list of values that are dependent on what is selected in the parent list.\n\nRead more about using forms\n\nNew Jira instances are now domain-enabled\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNew Jira instances will be automatically domain-enabled from now on, meaning anyone with your organization's email domain (the one you used to sign up) will have access to projects that you send them links to.

This sentence disappears after your first 15 days of having Confluence.\n\nThis sentence has been updated. It will now read: Confluence. Document collaboration.\n\nAdd and delete transition rules in the new workflow editor\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAs we continue to improve workflows in Jira, we're working to add important features from the old workflow designer to the new workflow editor.

Here's how:\n\nGo to your channel in Teams and select …›\n\nWorkflows > Post to a channel when a webhook request is received.\n\nPaste the webhook URL into the ‘Send Microsoft Teams message’ action.\n\nSelect Update.\n\nWe recommend updating your rules by December 31, 2024.\n\nSimplify your marketing work intake with a form template\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWith a ready-to-go template, you can quickly request information from your stakeholders for marketing campaigns, content creation, event planning, social media posts, graphic design, or email marketing.\n\nTo get started:\n\nSelect Forms from the project view navigation.\n\nSelect Templates to open the templates drawer on the right.\n\nLearn more about creating forms\n\nAdmins can now delete previous project keys\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re giving admins the ability to delete previous project keys so they can be used for new projects.\n\nWhenever you change your project key, we automatically save your previous project keys.

Jira now allows you to create and manage these additional fields in context of the list view to save you from navigating away from your work.\n\nThis will help your team with viewing the right, relevant information upfront when completing tasks.\n\nTo get started with the change, select the plus symbol at the top right of your list view to show or hide more fields, and manage your custom fields.\n\nTrack and triage incidents affecting your services in Jira\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re excited to roll out the new incidents feature in Jira Software Cloud.\n\nThis feature pulls in data from connected incident management, monitoring, and observability tools, so your development team can have a holistic view of incidents impacting services they are responsible for.\n\nOur first supported product is Jira Service Management, and we plan to add support for more incident management and observability tools soon.\n\nBy turning unexpected incidents into manageable, visible work, you can improve your team’s focus on quick resolution and internal review while building proactive work practices to prevent incidents from happening again.\n\nTo get started with the incidents feature:\n\nFor some customers who use Jira Service Management, the feature will be available and automatically appear under Operations in the list of features.\n\nTo turn it on manually:\n\nGo to Project settings > Features.\n\nToggle Incidents on.\n\nWe're gradually rolling out the incidents feature over the next few weeks to specific customers. If you don't see it yet, check back again soon.\n\nHide unused fields when creating issues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThere can be a lot of fields to scroll through when you’re creating issues, and we know there are many fields that are simply unused.\n\nWe’re introducing a feature that only brings up the fields you actually use. We’ll create a personalized Create issue form for each issue type and project.\n\nAll the fields you don’t use will be hidden in a More fields section, so you'll always be able to interact with them. The feature is continuously learning. If we notice you using a previously unused field, we’ll pull it out of the More fields section for the next time.\n\nWe’ll automatically turn on the feature to hide unused fields when creating issues, but you can manage it by heading to Personal settings and finding to the Jira labs section. From there, you can use the toggle to opt in and out of the feature.\n\nTemplate bundles in the project create page\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nEffortlessly create between 2 to 6 projects at once, with bundles.

Here are recommendations for how to structure your data for Assets schemas.\n\nSee also: How to build an effective ITAM schema structure.\n\nFor this reason, we're introducing a maximum cardinality limit of 20,000 per object type attribute for Assets. Read more about recommended data structures for Assets.\n\nExceeding these limits can cause performance and reliability issues, therefore each site cannot create further items once they reach the limit. You can find out how many objects your site currently contains using the feature usage screen. Read more about how to track your usage.\n\nCompany-managed projects: Create, edit, and delete columns directly on the board\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIf you want to quickly add or update a column on your board, you don’t need to go far. You can now create, rename, move, set constraints for, and delete columns without leaving the board.

In the new import experience, select Download a configuration file at the end of your next Jira project import. Upload it with a CSV file in another import to bring in the same preferences without the hassle of selecting the same fields once again.\n\nTo use a configuration file during an import:\n\nFrom the navigation bar, select Projects > Create project > Import data.\n\nSelect the app from which you’d like to import your data from. If you can’t find your app in the list, select CSV to use any CSV file to import your data.\n\nIf you select Asana, ClickUp, monday, or Trello, you can directly import data without a CSV file.\n\nSelect Upload a configuration file (optional) and upload the configuration file you downloaded from a previous import.\n\nSelect Next and continue with the import.\n\nRead about configuration files\n\nPriorities page refreshed and more accessible\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdding priorities to work communicates urgency and brings focus to the most important tasks.\n\nUse the refreshed Priorities page to add, delete, and re-order priorities.

Issues can still be scheduled in those ways, but this is now the quickest way to do it.\n\nHow to create, edit, and delete issues in your calendar\n\nTo create an issue in your calendar:\n\nSelect an empty space on the date you’d like the issue scheduled. The date selected will be the issue’s due date.\n\nEnter a summary, select the issue type, then select Create.\n\nTo create an issue that spans multiple days:\n\nClick and drag to select multiple days. The first and last dates selected will be the issue’s start and due date.\n\nEnter a summary, select the issue type, then select Create.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've fixed a bug where attachments in private comments were visible to all users. If your issue cards were configured to show images, these would show on the board and backlog too.\n\nThis is no longer the case — if you can see attachments in private comments or images on the board and backlog, rest assured that you're the intended audience.\n\nJira Service Management\n\nJira Service Desk is now Jira Service Management! We’re in the process of rolling out some exciting new features for all users. Learn more about these new features.\n\nROLLING OUT NEW THIS WEEK\n\nEarlier this year, we released a new feature powered by Atlassian Intelligence that updates the request types for multiple issues at once.\n\nThis is particularly useful when you receive requests by email and end up with a lot of issues with the Emailed request request type. Using the Atlassian Intelligence triage feature, you can easily update these issues to have more appropriate request types.\n\nNow, if the suggestions don't match what you need for your issues, you can select your own request type from the list and continue the bulk update with your own selected request type.\n\nRequest types that the issue can't be moved to can't be selected. For example, request types with required fields that can't be filled by Atlassian Intelligence won't be available in the list.\n\nTo update the request types of issues with Atlassian Intelligence:\n\nSelect issues in your queue.\n\nSelect Triage.\n\nReview the suggestions and update request types if necessary.\n\nSelect the issues you want to update.\n\nSelect Apply.\n\nThe new global issue create experience is enabled for all instances\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve modernized and optimized the experience to create issues to make it fast and scalable.

This update aims to reduce the reliance on cut and paste actions to improve the efficiency of your content creation.\n\nSingle-click nesting: Drag and drop to nest content such as tables, code blocks, expands, panels, and layouts.\n\nImproved content management: The new feature supports nesting of paragraphs containing inline elements, making content organization more intuitive.\n\nEnhanced table interactions: Nest within tables, which represents the highest proportion of nesting scenarios, is now more seamless.\n\nAutomatically get a personal space\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nA personal space in Confluence is a place of your own to jot down new ideas, introduce yourself to your team, keep track of tasks, store important items or files, polish content before sharing with others, and more.\n\nYou can choose to leave the space open for others to visit and collaborate, or you can restrict the pages so that no one else can see them.\n\nIf you don't already have a personal space, one will be created for you after you've logged in and viewed a page. There are three ways to get to your personal space:\n\nSelect Spaces in the global navigation bar. Your personal space is automatically starred for easy access.\n\nSelect your profile icon at the top right of the global navigation bar and select Personal Space.\n\nSelect Home in the global navigation bar. All starred spaces are shown on the right.\n\nLearn more about personal spaces\n\nTransfer of page ownership between users\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen a page is created, the person who creates is now known as the owner of that page. We've made it possible for page owners to transfer ownership of their page to another person at any time. Space and site admins can also transfer page ownership from one user to another.\n\nThis way, if a current page owner leaves a project, team, or company, ownership of the page can then be granted to whomever is most appropriate, and maintenance and validity of the page remains fresh.\n\nA page owner is the ‘point person’ for a given page and their name appears in the byline, under the page title.\n\nLearn more about page ownership and how it can be transferred\n\nControl what you see in your products\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nProduct recommendations now have controls, so now you can dismiss them or learn more about why you’re seeing them. These controls are being added to the recommendations in the app switcher menu which means you'll have more control and receive better product recommendations.\n\nYou can select the three dots next to the recommendation to learn why we have recommended it or to dismiss it entirely.\n\nThe recommendation controls will first be released to both Free and Standard teams of up to 50 users. Note: Only admins will be able to add a new product by clicking on the recommendation.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen a new comment is created, a highlight will now appear on the page in real-time. Similarly, comment replies - along with resolved or reopened comments - will also appear instantly in real-time.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nInline comments anchored to highlighted text can get resolved when that text is changed or deleted during an editing session. It is now possible to restore those comments by reattaching them to selected text in the editor.\n\nResolved comments can be accessed from the More actions menu on the toolbar. Find the resolved inline comment you want to restore, and select Restore comment.\n\nIn the editor, highlight text you'd like to add the comment to, and select Add comment.\n\nConfigure and display labeled content with clarity and ease\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now find and customize the Filter by label macro (formerly known as \"Content by Label\") more easily than ever, thanks to the following changes:\n\nNew and improved name and icon for instant discovery.\n\nA simpler filtering experience with a more clearly organized dropdown menu.\n\nAn overall clearer and better organized set of options in the configuration modal, for faster and easier customization.\n\nSeamlessly migrate from Notion to Confluence with bulk importing\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nOur new bulk importer tool makes it easy for you to migrate your content from Notion to Confluence, ensuring a smooth transition and minimal disruption. With support for importing up to 40,000 pages, including attachments and page comments, site and organization admins can now move their workspaces with confidence. The tool also allows you to preserve user data and permission settings to boost familiar patterns within Confluence.\n\nSite and organization admins can import to 40,000 pages from Notion to Confluence, including attachments, page comments, @mentions, and author information.\n\nPreserve user data and permission settings for a more seamless transition.\n\nSupports importing entire workspaces or selected pages.\n\nA completion report email shows an overview of the import outcome, providing transparency and simplifying following up.\n\nSelect Import from other tools in the Spaces menu and follow the step-by-step guide to import your content from Notion.\n\nManage space access in bulk\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdmins can now save a bunch of time and repetitive tasks by adding a single user or group to all spaces on a site (or remove them from all spaces) in one bulk action.\n\nThis can be done for literally all spaces on the site, for all spaces except personal spaces, or exclusively for all personal spaces.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNow, Atlassian Intelligence can summarize page comments for you, making it easier and faster to catch up on important feedback. Just navigate to the bottom of the page, above the first page comment, and select Summarize comments.\n\nNew comments since you last checked? Select the refresh icon to generate a summary that includes all the latest feedback.\n\nIntroducing content generation with richer context\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nGet smarter content creation with the AI-powered features in the Editor! With this update, you can now access information from your Confluence instances. Just share a link, and the AI will use data from these sources, making your content creation more insightful and comprehensive.\n\nSmartlinks: Use Smartlinks to seamlessly integrate information from Confluence pages. Simply paste a link, and the AI will automatically consider the content when crafting your prompt.\n\nTry: Give me a tl;dr about this project <link to project page>\n\nContent summarization: Get AI-powered summaries of articles, comments, and Confluence content. This can help you quickly understand complex topics and extract key insights.\n\nTry: Summarise the work that has been done on this ticket <link to Jira ticket>\n\nComprehension assistance: Leverage AI to translate user stories into technical content, highlight important points in documents, group fragmented information, and map relevant details. This streamlines your workflow and saves you valuable time.\n\nTry: List all the open action items from this page <link to meeting notes>\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe're adding the ability to create automation rules directly from the public links setting on a page.\n\nWhen an admin on a Confluence space with automation turns a page's public link on or off, they will see a prompt to create a new automation rule to manage public links.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdmins can now create automation rules to manage public links on their Confluence site.\n\nWhen you use the public links settings, we'll show you a prompt to automatically build a rule for public links in new spaces.\n\nAutomatically build automation rules to assign guest users to a space\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdmins can now create automation rules to manage space assignments for guest users.\n\nWe'll show you a prompt to automatically build a rule to assign spaces to new guest users when you assign spaces in three ways:\n\nUsing the dropdown menu next to the guest user's name\n\nUsing the bulk assign screen\n\nSetting a default space for guest users in Global Permissions\n\nSet the default space for new guests\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdmins will now be able to choose a default space for all future guests directly from the Assign guest to a space interface. When assigning a guest to a space, admins will now see a checkbox that lets them use that space as the default space for guests.\n\nConfluence admins navigate to Settings (wheel icon) and select Global Permissions.\n\nSelect the Guests tab.\n\nSelect one or more guests and select + Assign Space.\n\nSelect a space and then check the box next to Set as default space for guests.\n\nSelect Assign.\n\nGet a direct path to the default space for guests\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdmins will now be able to access the default guest space settings in Global permissions directly from the guest request access email. We’ve made it easier for admins to understand the benefits of setting a default space for guest accounts.\n\nEmails sent to admins when a guest requests access will now include a link that takes the admin directly to the relevant settings page. The same link will also appear in the weekly summary of all guest accounts without space access.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThe commenting experience will now be available in whiteboards, alongside pages. Leave comments, @mention teammates, reply to conversations, and more with comments in Confluence whiteboards. You can see mentions and replies directly in your notifications.\n\nSwitch to comment mode in a whiteboard by selecting the comment icon in the toolbar on the right or use M on your keyboard. Once you're in comment mode, click anywhere on the whiteboard to create a comment.\n\nMore delightful reactions with floating emojis\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve made reactions more delightful in Confluence!\n\nAll users can now respond with floating emojis on Confluence pages, blogs, and comments, and even react to activity in your home feed.\n\nThis isn't limited to our emojis – the floating effects will work on any Atlassian-provided emojis or custom emojis you've created.\n\nTo get started, go to an existing comment and select an emoji. The delightful reaction will then appear on your screen.\n\nIntroducing Spaces report: Empower your space management\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nUnlock comprehensive space management with our new Spaces report feature. Export detailed CSV reports on space activity, creation, and more directly from Confluence. This feature is ideal for admins seeking insights into space usage, activity, and storage.\n\nKey changes:\n\nExportable CSV reports for product admins, detailing each space's key metrics.\n\nReports include space key, name, type, status, creation date, last activity, and storage used.\n\nNew Spaces report page under Data management for easy access and report management.\n\nSupports organization, site, and product admins across Standard, Premium, and Enterprise plans.\n\nThis feature also provides essential space management data previously unavailable in Confluence. It aids in identifying inactive spaces, managing storage, and enhancing external collaboration, significantly improving admin efficiency and decision-making.\n\nNew cross-product actions available in Confluence automation\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've added 3 new cross-product actions in Confluence automation: Create version, Comment on issue, and Delete issue. Previously, these actions were only available in Jira automation. However, with this update, you can now create versions in Jira and delete or comment on Jira issues via Confluence automation.\n\nTo use the Create version action:\n\nIn the Confluence automation rulebuilder, select any trigger.\n\nSelect Add action and then select Create Version in Jira.\n\nEnter a valid name into the Version name field.\n\nOpen the More options section and then select a valid project.\n\nTurn on your rule.

You can now set column widths to fixed, ensuring that your table layout remains consistent even on narrow screens. This option is available in Table options in the table toolbar and is unchecked by default, allowing tables to scale as they always have. For those who prefer their tables to respond dynamically to screen sizes, we’ve increased the maximum scaling to give your tables even more flexibility.\n\nHow to use:\n\nInsert or select a table on your page.\n\nSelect the Table options icon in the table toolbar.\n\nSelect the Fixed column widths option to prevent your table columns from scaling down on narrow screens.\n\nThis update allows you to maintain the integrity of your table layouts across different screen sizes, providing a more consistent viewing experience.\n\nRename space key in Confluence Cloud\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re adding the ability to change your space’s key. Renaming space keys can help with accurately representing a company to users and publicly as organization changes take place. It can also help to prevent conflicts during migrations for newly created spaces.\n\nKey changes\n\nSpace admins can rename their space (for example, during acquisitions, organization restructuring, or if the department, username, or team name changes).\n\nThe old space key will redirect to the new URL.\n\nTo get started with this change:\n\nAs a space admin, go to Space settings > Manage space > Space details.\n\nSelect Edit space details.\n\nEnter your new name in the Space key text box.\n\nSelect Save.\n\nExperience improvements to whiteboards\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've made multiple improvements to whiteboards that will make them easier to use and more flexible for your needs.\n\nKey changes:\n\nSet connectors to be dotted or dashed, in addition to the existing solid style.\n\nQuickly align selected elements in many ways: left, right, horizontally, vertically, top, or bottom.\n\nDrag stickers directly from the toolbar.\n\nCreate issues without making a selection first by selecting Create Jira issue from the More menu in the toolbar.\n\nSet the toolbar to minimize when you're not using it.

To open the shortcuts menu, go to the More menu at the top right of the screen and select Keyboard shortcuts.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now comment directly on inline elements such as emojis, statuses, mentions, dates, and inline cards (Smart links). Users can now leave comments on these specific elements, streamlining the commenting process and making it more intuitive and efficient for providing feedback and collaborating on documents.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nHyperlinks can now be added to whiteboards text.\n\nEasily share links with your collaborators on a whiteboard through free text or text within an element. Hyperlinked text will appear blue.\n\nAutomation: Filter audit log entries by status\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIn the Automation audit log, you can now show or hide entries based on status, making it easier to find specific rule runs and investigate rules that aren't working as intended.\n\nTo check it out:\n\nNavigate to automation:\n\nFor Confluence automation, go to Confluence settings > Automation\n\nFor Jira automation, go to Jira settings > System > Global automation\n\nSelect Audit log.\n\nSelect Status and choose which statuses you want to filter by.\n\nCreate more custom shapes with whiteboards border styling\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdd borders to shapes in Confluence whiteboards.\n\nChoose between a solid or dashed line border, with a selection of colors. Borders can be added to a shape with or without fill color.\n\nYou can remove borders by selecting the border button again. A shape must have a fill color to remove the border.\n\nMore control over notifications\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nPage owners no longer receive notifications by default when someone interacts with their page. Instead, they can opt-in to notifications by choosing to Watch the page. This change reduces the noise of unnecessary communications (for example, when pages are no longer actively monitored or updated) — and improves the value of the notifications that do appear in the person's inbox and message feeds.\n\nRead more about how to watch a page\n\nBulk duplicate and delete components in the automation rulebuilder\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe're introducing a new feature that allows you to select multiple components at once in the automation rulebuilder and either duplicate or delete them. This change affects both Jira and Confluence, and should help to improve efficiency in the rulebuilder, as you'll no longer need to select each component one at a time to edit them.\n\nTo select and edit multiple components at once:\n\nHold down the Ctrl / Command key and click the left button on your mouse or touchpad.\n\nSelect the number of components you want to duplicate or delete.\n\nOnce the components are selected, you can use the new menu to duplicate or delete them.\n\nAutomation: Changes to 'Send Microsoft Teams message' action\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIn response to changes announced by Microsoft, we've shipped some updates to how the Send Microsoft Teams message action works.\n\nThe action now uses Workflows in Microsoft Teams to send messages from your automation rules.\n\nFor existing rules that already use the Send Microsoft Teams message action, you'll need to update the Webhook URL field. Here's how:\n\nGo to your channel in Teams and select …›\n\nWorkflows > Post to a channel when a webhook request is received.\n\nPaste the webhook URL into the ‘Send Microsoft Teams message’ action.\n\nSelect Update.\n\nWe recommend updating your rules by December 31, 2024.\n\nCustomizable page creation from Confluence databases\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nUtilize more flexible and customizable page creation configurations in the page link field of Confluence databases.\n\nYou can choose a fixed or dynamic page location. This means new pages can always be created in one place or dynamically created from wherever you're editing.\n\nAdditionally, where you could previously only choose one, you can now use both a page template and a database entry macro for newly created pages.\n\nManage and customize your company hub with greater ease\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIt's easier than ever to control and calibrate who has edit access to your company hub. You can now access Hub permissions directly from the More actions (...) menu while editing your hub page, to add or remove hub editors as needed.\n\nWe've also improved some Company Hub adjacent settings in Customize navigation and General configuration. This makes it more intuitive to customize your Confluence navigation bar to fit your company's branding or preferences.\n\nCustomize duration for waiting for a response while running the AWS SSM document and resume rule in case of no response\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen running the AWS SSM document, you can configure the action to wait for a response for a duration of 1 to 15 minutes. Additionally, you can now set the rule to resume even if AWS SSM doesn't return a response within the specified time.\n\nCustomize duration for waiting for a response while running a query in New Relic and resume rule in case of no response\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen running a query in New Relic, you can configure the action to wait for a duration of 1 to 15 minutes.

Choose between Knowledge base and Collaboration, add a description to the overview, and dive into content creation faster than ever before with one of our suggested templates. Or, if you know you want something really specific, choose Custom to manually configure the features and settings for your space.\n\nTo read about these changes in more detail, check out the Community post.\n\nTo create a space:\n\nSelect Create from the Confluence navigation bar at the top of the screen.\n\nSelect Space from the dropdown menu.\n\nChoose the option that best fits the purpose of the space you're creating.\n\nConfirm your choice, making changes to the defaults as needed.\n\nBitbucket\n\nThree more merge strategies are now available\n\nROLLING OUT NEW THIS WEEK\n\nWe have added three more merge strategies which offers you more flexibility across your deployment and implementation workflows.

      "# [Latest updates](https://developer.atlassian.com/jiradev/latest-updates)\nWe release new versions of our Jira Data Center products frequently. As a Jira developer, it's important that you're aware of the changes. The following resources will help you keep track of what's happening.\n\nAtlassian Developer Community\n\nMajor changes that affect Jira Data Center developers are posted in the Atlassian Developer Community, like announcing EAP releases, adding new Jira modules, or the deprecation of API endpoints. You'll also find handy tips and articles related to Jira development.\n\nCheck out our Atlassian Developer Community\n\nEarly Access Program\n\nAn Early Access Program (EAP) release is a public development release leading up to the official release of a Jira version. Development releases are a snapshot of our work in progress, primarily focused on allowing Jira users to see the new features in advance and provide us with some useful feedback. EAP releases can include changes like:\n\nChanges to our APIs\n\nDatabase changes\n\nChanges to Jira bundled apps and libraries\n\nChanges in our supported platforms\n\nDownload the latest Jira EAP release\n\nEAP releases include more mature Beta Release and Release Candidate (RC) but they generally don't introduce new changes. Instead, they provide bug fixes and tweaks to features introduced in earlier EAP releases.\n\nLatest EAP\n\nThe EAP releases give you an opportunity to test and fix your apps in advance of an official release.

      "# [Why are Forge apps unavailable for Jira Premium/Enterprise SANDBOX installations? on 2024-07-18](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/why-are-forge-apps-unavailable-for-jira-premium-enterprise-sandbox-installations/81925)\nWhy are Forge apps unavailable for Jira Premium/Enterprise SANDBOX installations? Doesn’t this place Forge apps at a competitive disadvantage to Connect apps in the Atlassian Marketplace?\n\n(I’m asking this question as both a customer and an app developer.)\n\nJira Premium/Enterprise has a sandbox feature. A feature of sandboxes is that you can add apps for free if those apps are paid-for in your production site. (i.e. You only need to pay for an app once between sandbox and production.)\n\nAtlassian Marketplace apps with a paid subscription on a linked production environment can be added to a sandbox for free.\n\nHowever, I discovered that some of my paid productions apps cannot be added to my sandbox for free. Instead, the Atlassian Marketplace wants me to pay for a second app subscription.\n\nHere’s what is supposed to be displayed when adding an already-subscribed app to a sandbox:\n\nNotice the button says “Add to sandbox” and the caption indicates the app is already purchased.\n\nAnd this is the information bubble:\n\nBut for some apps that are already purchased, you see the normal trial/subscription feature:\n\nExpecting it to be a Marketplace bug, I submitted a support ticket. This was the response:\n\n[App name] is a forge app which means that Atlassian does not provide free apps for the “forge” category of apps.\n\n.\n\nForge is a platform for building Atlassian Jira/Confluence apps just like connect : About Forge\n\n.\n\nIn this case, you can reach out to the app vendor and ask them for approval to extend the app on the sandbox.\n\n.\n\nOnce you have this approval please provide me with a screenshot of it and I would be happy to extend the evaluation of the app for you.\n\nFrom a customer perspective, this feels bad for a few reasons:\n\nIt’s confusing: As a customer, how do I know which apps are Forge apps and which are Connect apps? (And how many customers even aware of Forge vs. Connect?)\n\nIt’s inconvenient: It either costs me more money, or I have to contact individual app vendors and either get a promo code for my sandbox or send approval to Atlassian support.\n\nIt violates the advertised functionality for Premium sandboxes.\n\nFrom a developer perspective, it’s even worse (IMO): Atlassian is strongly encouraging us to adopt Forge, but it seems that doing so could put us at a competitive disadvantage, right?\n\nJira Premium/Enterprise users will be motivated to select a Connect app over a Forge app if they’re using the sandbox feature. I realize that sandboxes typically have fewer users than prod sites, so the extra sandbox subscription should be less than the prod subscription. But still, I would expect most people to opt for a free sandbox installation (Connect) than a paid sandbox installation (Forge). (Obviously, this is assuming the Forge app doesn’t have enough of a differentiation to outweigh the sandbox fees.)\n\nI guess this is a question that turned into a rant. So back to the question…why is it this way? Am I wrong about the competitive disadvantage? Or is it actually a bug and not expected as Atlassian Support claimed?\n\nThanks!",

      "# [User interface differences when switching to Jira and Confluence Cloud](https://success.atlassian.com/solution-resources/cloud-shift/cloud-topics/user-interface-differences-when-switching-to-jira-and-confluence-cloud)\nSwitching from Jira or Confluence Data Center or Server products to their Atlassian cloud counterparts can be a disorienting experience for users if they're not prepared. As the admin, you can help orient your users by understanding how the cloud UI (user interface) and UX (user experience) differs, and then communicating those differences to your users. We've outlined the most significant changes below.\n\nCloud URL\n\nWhen you transition to Atlassian cloud, you’ll have a new cloud site URL to access your Atlassian products. You’ll have the same base URL for Confluence and Jira, but each will have a different suffix:\n\nConfluence: https://yourdomain.atlassian.net/wiki/home\n\nJira: https://yourdomain.atlassian.net/jira/your-work\n\nFor admins: To help redirect people still coming to the on-premise instance to your new cloud site URL, you can apply a site-wide banner in the on-premise versions of Jira and Confluence, or you can add an announcement to your online help center in Jira Service Management.\n\nFor end-users: If you've bookmarked previous Data Center or Server pages, be sure to update them with the new cloud links.\n\nJira\n\nGeneral user interface\n\nThe Jira Cloud UI looks more modern than its Jira Data Center and Jira Server counterparts. (See an overview of the updated core experiences.)\n\nJira Cloud, Jira Data Center, and Jira Server have similar sidebars and horizontal global navigation. Jira Cloud’s main navigation bar gives you quick access to the projects, filters, and dashboards you use most. It also lets you create issues, search, and access help notifications and Jira settings.\n\nInterface details:\n\nProduct switcher: Switch to other Atlassian cloud products, like Bitbucket and Confluence, and go to recent projects.\n\nJira logo and product name\n\nYour work: Get an overview of the things you care most about in Jira. Find issues, projects, boards, and queues you’ve visited, work assigned to you, and your starred items.\n\nProjects, filters, and dashboards: Quickly find and resume work on the things you use most. Your starred items appear at the top of each menu, followed by your recently-visited items.\n\nPeople: See the people and teams you work with, and create new teams.\n\nPlans: See and manage your plans (Premium and Enterprise only).\n\nApps: See and manage apps installed on your Jira site.\n\nCreate: Create issues.\n\nSearch: Find issues, projects, boards, queues, filters, and people.\n\nNotifications, help, Jira settings, and your profile and settings: See what's happening in Jira, get help, and customize Jira’s settings (Jira admins only) and your personal settings.\n\nFor more details, see the Jira Cloud navigation page.\n\nThere is no issues drop-down in Jira Cloud, a significant change from the Jira Data Center format. Instead, a user’s recent activity will appear in the new Your work menu item on the top left, which will include issues. Filters are now a separate menu item and you can find issues using the search bar:\n\nIn Jira Cloud, searching is site-wide and includes Confluence and linked Bitbucket accounts.\n\nThe project board and backlog view are similar in both versions for Scrum and Kanban projects. In the cloud, there’s a 5,000 issue limit per board and, unlike on Jira Data Center, you can plan future sprints.\n\nCloud project view\n\nJira Data Center project view\n\nIssue view\n\nHere's the history of the Jira issue UI:\n\nJira Cloud had a UI. Then they got a new one. The legacy view should be deprecated from all sites at this point (although it can still be reverted to manually).\n\nJira Data Center and Jira Server haven’t had a lot of changes and look close to the old Jira Cloud UI.\n\nIf you're familiar with the Jira Data Center and Jira Server UI, you won't notice much difference from Jira Cloud's legacy UI. However, it is more likely you'll be using the new Jira cloud UI, so the change will be significant.\n\nThe new issue view groups key actions and information in a more logical way, making it easier for you to scan and update your issues. The issue view usually appears as a two-column layout on boards and as a single column in the backlog, but it is responsive to the size of your window.\n\nSee What is the new Jira issue view? for more details.\n\nYou might feel information isn't as visible as it was before, but take a look at the side-by-side comparison to see which fields are collapsed in the new UI:\n\nCloud new issue view\n\nData Center issue view\n\nTeam-managed projects vs company-managed projects\n\nIn Jira Cloud, migrated projects will end up as company-managed projects.\n\nPreviously, team-managed projects were known as “next-gen,” and company-managed projects were known as “classic.”\n\nThe differences between team-managed projects and company-managed projects are outlined at Atlassian Support.\n\nSchemes and workflows might be different on the cloud, depending on your migration process. You'll need to educate your teams about what schemes are available in their Jira Cloud site and how they might differ from what they used on Jira Data Center.\n\nIn Jira Cloud, boards are project-independent, meaning they exist within and are only available to software projects, but they may be powered by filters, including non-software projects. In Jira Data Center, boards are independent and may include any projects or Jira Query Language-powered issues. While you can archive projects in Jira Cloud, currently you can't archive specific issues like you can in Data Center, but this capability is on our roadmap.\n\nNoteworthy new features\n\nAutomation for Jira is now part of Jira Software Data Center 9.0 and Jira Service Management Data Center 5.0. However, many of the automation features developed for Jira Cloud in recent years are not available in automation for Jira Data Center. These include:\n\nThe ability to run rules as another user\n\nIn Jira Cloud, advanced triggers and automation functionality are included out of the box.\n\nLearn more at Jira Cloud automation support\n\nAdvanced Roadmaps: This may or may not be new depending on whether it was installed in your Jira Data Center or Jira Server instance.\n\nThe cloud version of Advanced Roadmaps doesn’t include the ability to create programs — group of plans — which is available on Jira Data Center. As of Advanced Roadmaps v.3.29, UI differences between the Data Center and cloud versions are minor.\n\nBasic roadmaps (project-specific): The roadmap is where you can create, manage and visualize your team's epics. Roadmaps are useful for planning large pieces of work several months in advance and planning large groups of stories across different sprints.\n\nA wider variety of ready-to-use project templates and, in particular, 23 new work management templates, are bundled in Jira Software Cloud.\n\nDevOps insights: Includes Jira graph data aggregation, a richer display, and more insight. Teams can create new branches and see associated development work, including:\n\nBuilds\n\nPull requests\n\nCommits\n\nDeployments\n\nBranches\n\nFeature flags\n\nCustom links\n\nConfluence\n\nHome Page\n\nBoth Jira Cloud and Data Center have a common access point to the home page: the Confluence logo at the top left. In the cloud, there is now a home link on the top navigation. The Confluence Cloud home is vastly different than its Data Center counterpart and has new benefits:\n\n📄 Resume your work by getting back to your pages faster with recent front and center.\n\n👥 Catch up on relevant activity with the new following feed.\n\n💡Discover what’s happening across your company with the updated popular feed.\n\nRead more about the new Confluence home.\n\nCloud home\n\nData Center home\n\nGeneral interface\n\nBoth versions of Confluence have sidebar navigation for pages in spaces. Some elements are in different parts of the page. The left navigation in cloud makes it easy to reorder and regroup pages with a drag-and-drop experience.\n\nAnother key difference is that space tools is now in the top of the left navigation and is called space settings in cloud. We’ve also refreshed the look and feel of the space settings page so it’s easier to find the setting you need.\n\nThe editor\n\nThe editor features some of the biggest UX differences between the cloud and data center versions. While the Confluence Data Center editor has not changed much recently and functions and looks like the old cloud editor, significant changes were introduced to the Confluence editor in the cloud. The cloud version of Confluence unlocks a lot of new templates, and page formatting is very different.\n\nConfluence Cloud has fewer macros, and some macros (such as the office macro) don’t have feature parity. This is why, during user acceptance testing (UAT) it’s important to test all macros used by your teams (see: cloud macros vs Data Center macros).\n\nThanks to live macros, the editing experience in cloud is consistent with the viewing experience. Pages look the same during editing as they do once they're published.\n\nSome macros were intentionally excluded from the new editor to improve performance, but there are alternative methods you can use to get the same results (see here for more details).\n\nCloud “fabric\" editor\n\nData center editor\n\nTo stay up-to-date on features that are rolled out to the new editor, keep an eye on the Atlassian blog, where we announce product changes weekly.\n\nWe’ve introduced collaborative editing, which updates the way drafts behave, and moves to a model that's more consistent with how content should be stored for collaborative editing. We'll call the outgoing model, used prior to collaborative editing, personal drafts, and the new model, shared drafts. The notable differences are:\n\nWhen editing a page prior to collaborative editing, a new personal draft was created for each user and the changes couldn't be seen by other users, as personal drafts are private. Using collaborative editing, a single shared draft is created for each page, and anyone editing the page will see the same draft.\n\nPersonal drafts were represented by a draft class, which extends ContentEntityObject and contains a draftType field indicating whether the draft was a page or blogpost. We're deprecating the draft class in favor of using the existing page and blogpost classes, where a contentStatus field of draft will indicate the object is a draft.\n\nBefore you start a Data Center-to-cloud migration, publish draft pages, because if draft pages contain Jira links or links to other Confluence pages, those links won’t be captured by the link-fixing script Atlassian support runs post-migration.\n\nAutocomplete keyboard shortcuts in the editor\n\nOne of the biggest changes are the autocomplete shortcuts used in the editor. If you're used to the Data Center editor, you might be familiar with the “” wiki markup notation. You'll now need to switch to using the autocomplete slash command, which is a single command, to add macros and tools you might not be familiar with.\n\nNote the following changes:\n\nAction\n\nCloud autocomplete character\n\nData Center autocomplete character\n\nTables\n\n/\n\n|\n\nLinks\n\n/\n\n[\n\nImages\n\n/\n\n!\n\nMacros\n\n/\n\n{\n\nHeadings\n\n#\n\nh1.\n\nLists (unordered)\n\n*\n\n*\n\nLists (ordered)\n\n1.\n\n#\n\nSmart Links reveal important context about links within a Confluence page (or Jira issue) without leaving that page. When you paste a link in the editor, it will transform into a Smart Link. We support Smart Links for Atlassian products and many other third parties. There are a few different ways to view Smart Links. Check them out below:\n\nInline view\n\nCard view\n\nEmbed view\n\nHyperlink … with style. The Smart Links inline view makes your links pop on the page. You’ll see the logo from the source of the link, so you quickly have information about the type of content. When inserting a link to other Atlassian products, you’ll get even more details, like the status of a Jira ticket.\n\nSmart Links card view provides even richer detail. You can see a small preview of the content, plus additional information about it. You’ll also start to see actions added to cards over time.\n\nWhat if you never had to break the flow of work (or leave a Confluence page) to interact with content that lives outside of Confluence? Well, Smart Link embed views help you do it.\n\nRead and edit a Google Drive document, manipulate your Figma file and more, all within a Confluence page.\n\nRead more about Smart Links here\n\nSearch\n\nConfluence Cloud search produces better, more relevant results than Confluence Data Center:\n\nOther editor changes\n\nInline comments when editing: Whether you are editing a page or viewing it, the process for adding inline comments is the same:\n\nHighlight the text you want to comment on.\n\nSelect the add comment button that appears above the highlighted text.\n\nEnter your comment and select save (Ctrl+S or ⌘+S).\n\nThe Data Center editor is full width by default.\n\nAnchor links are automatically created in cloud for headings. Non-heading links still need to be specified by the anchor macro.\n\nAdding attachments will have fewer features and a different UI.\n\nYou can't natively link to or render attachments from other pages. You might be used to setting up image or file libraries that can be referred to from other pages, but instead, you can copy and paste the attachment link directly.\n\nTables in the cloud are edited and managed differently: In general, it should be a more intuitive experience but it may take some time to adjust.\n\nOther new features in Confluence\n\nTeam calendar (now bundled in Confluence Premium)\n\nLanguages: Atlassian's cloud products and apps are available in two dozen languages, with more on the way. See our manage your language preferences page for a complete list of the languages that are currently available.\n\nThe mobile apps for Jira Software and Confluence Cloud are different. If you currently use the Data Center mobile apps for these products, you’ll need to install new apps:\n\nJira mobile: the official Jira app from Atlassian\n\nConfluence mobile for iPhone and Android from Atlassian\n\nAtlassian Access also comes with mobile device management (MDM) for Atlassian mobile apps.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nLink\n\nDescription\n\nWatch the blog to get regular updates on what is changing in cloud\n\nCloud Adoption Toolkit can be used to build and execute a successful adoption and change management plan.\n\nResources include:\n\nAtlassian’s guide to change management and adoption\n\nEmail templates for introducing Atlassian cloud products\n\nSetting your users up for success with Atlassian cloud products: admin guide\n\nQuick start guides for Jira Software and Confluence Cloud: user guide\n\nIdeas to explore:\n\nShare regular updates with users about new features, tips and tricks, etc. in Confluence blog post\n\nQuarterly user feedback surveys\n\nFree self-paced courses that will help your users get up and running in Confluence and Jira in just 90 minutes\n\nPaid courses for leveling up admin skills\n\nAdministration manual\n\nOrganization administration course\n\nA brief overview of the basics\n\nGetting started guides:\n\nFor admins who are new to the cloud landscape\n\nCloud release notes and news.\n\nWatch on-demand webinars as Partha Kamal, our Head Enterprise Product, and Dave Meyer, Sr. Group Product Manager for Enterprise Cloud, walk through the latest features we’ve added to Atlassian Cloud products within the last two quarters as well as the exciting features on our roadmap - including data residency, industry compliance, cloud user limits, and more.\n\nThe Atlassian Enterprise Group's mission is to encourage and foster discussions and thought leadership with the Atlassian Community around a broad spectrum of enterprise-related issues, best practices, use cases, workflows, and any other challenges unique to the space. This group is a place where customers and Atlassians can come together to create feedback loops and have open, honest discussions about Atlassian product plans, ideas, wins, problems, and quality.\n\nWas this content helpful?\n\nConnect, share, or get additional help\n\nAtlassian Community",

      "# [Security Flaw in Atlassian Products (Jira, Confluence,Trello, BitBucket) Affecting Multiple Companies by Sparsh Kulshrestha on 2022-12-13](https://www.cloudsek.com/blog/security-flaw-in-atlassian-products-jira-confluencetrello-bitbucket-affecting-multiple-companies)\nDecember 22: Atlassian has acknowledged the issue and has patched the same. On December 15, based on our research, they have simplified the self-service invalidation of tokens following a password change for Cloud users: Read the acknowledgment\n\nOn 6th Dec 2022, CloudSEK disclosed a cyber attack directed at the company. During the course of an investigation into the root cause of the incident, the internal investigation team identified that the threat actor gained access to a CloudSEK employee’s Jira account, using Jira session cookies present in stealer logs being sold on the darkweb.\n\nFollowing further investigation, it was found that for Atlassian products (Jira, Confluence, and BitBucket), cookies are not invalidated, even if the password is changed, with 2FA (Two-factor Authentication) enabled, as the cookie validity is 30 days. They only expire when the user logs out, or after 30 days.\n\nWe have Informed Atlassian regarding this and they have acknowledged and are working to Resolve the issue.\n\nCloudSEK researchers have identified that this flaw can take over hundreds of companies’ Jira accounts. Our records show over 1,282,859 compromised computers and 16,201 Jira cookies for sale on dark web marketplaces. And just in the last 30 days, over 2,937 compromised computers and 246 Jira credentials were made available. In the past 90 days, we have observed at least one compromised computer from a Fortune 1000 company. This is just considering their primary domains, not their subsidiaries.\n\nCloudSEK is releasing a free tool that lets companies check if their compromised computers and Jira accounts are being advertised on dark web marketplaces.\n\nWith over 10 million users across 180,000 companies, including 83% of Fortune 500 companies Atlassian products are widely used across the globe. And threat actors are actively exploiting this flaw to compromise enterprise Jira accounts.\n\nStolen Atlassian Cookies Can Lead to Unauthorized Account Access even if 2FA enabled.\n\nCloudSEK’s investigation shows that cookies of Atlassian products remain valid for a period of 30 days, even if the password is changed and 2FA is enabled. Hence, threat actors can restore Jira, Confluence, Trello, or BitBucket sessions, using stolen cookies, even if they don’t have access to MFA OTP/ PIN. The cookies, by default, expire when the user logs out, or after 30 days.\n\nThis is a known issue, and most companies do not consider it to be within the scope of security reporting, because to use this and get into systems, tokens are required. There are other vulnerabilities like XSS which can be used to get tokens and they are in scope for security reporting. However the use of social engineering is out of scope for Bug Bounty engagements and in this case, exploiting the malware and dumping information like cookies requires social engineering.\n\nHowever, it is no longer very difficult for threat actors to get their hands on these tokens. With the rise in device compromise campaigns, breaches, and password leaks, cookie theft has become commonplace. And cookies are available for sale and one can simply search for a company, buy their logs, find relevant tokens to gain access to their internal systems.\n\nIn the case of Atlassian products, only one JSON web token (JWT) is required to hijack a session i.e. cloud.session.token. Atlassian JWT (JSON Web Token) tokens have the email address embedded in the cookie. Hence, it is easy to determine which user the cookie belongs to.\n\nIt seems that this bug is fixed now by Atlassian very silently after we reported it and without acknowledging it.\n\nThe response for the change password request which I was getting on 13th December is different from what I’m getting now. Please refer to the attached screenshots of my burp suite history. Check the “Date” header in the response.\n\nResponse of change password endpoint on 15th Dec\n\nAtlassian added a redirectURL parameter in the response to change the password request now. This will invalidate the current session and will assign a new session token to the user. As of 13th Dec, there was no such parameter and upon changing the password users will just get a 200 OK response from the server.

On December 15, based on our research, they have simplified the self-service invalidation of tokens following a password change for Cloud users: Read the acknowledgment\n\nOn 6th Dec 2022, CloudSEK disclosed a cyber attack directed at the company. During the course of an investigation into the root cause of the incident, the internal investigation team identified that the threat actor gained access to a CloudSEK employee’s Jira account, using Jira session cookies present in stealer logs being sold on the darkweb.\n\nFollowing further investigation, it was found that for Atlassian products (Jira, Confluence, and BitBucket), cookies are not invalidated, even if the password is changed, with 2FA (Two-factor Authentication) enabled, as the cookie validity is 30 days. They only expire when the user logs out, or after 30 days.\n\nWe have Informed Atlassian regarding this and they have acknowledged and are working to Resolve the issue.\n\nCloudSEK researchers have identified that this flaw can take over hundreds of companies’ Jira accounts. Our records show over 1,282,859 compromised computers and 16,201 Jira cookies for sale on dark web marketplaces. And just in the last 30 days, over 2,937 compromised computers and 246 Jira credentials were made available. In the past 90 days, we have observed at least one compromised computer from a Fortune 1000 company.
