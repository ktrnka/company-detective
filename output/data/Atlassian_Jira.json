      "# [Atlassian developer changelog](https://developer.atlassian.com/changelog/)\nIn further detail:\n\nAny macros copy + pasted from this point onwards will receive a newly generated localId\n\nAny existing macros with duplicate IDs will not be affected\n\nThis is because changing these IDs has the possibility of altering the userâs view of the page, if apps are storing data keyed against this ID\n\nThe only caveat to the above is:\n\nCutting and pasting a pre-existing duplicated macro also triggers the paste logic, and will result in a new localId being generated\n\nThis does not apply to using the handles in the Confluence UI to drag the macro to a new position\n\nNote that localIds are only expected to be unique within a given page, so if you wish to have a globally unique ID across the entire site, you should continue to use a combination of content.id and localId.\n\nBecause of this, copying and pasting a macro from one page to another will not result in the ID being regenerated, unless that ID is no longer unique on the new page (such as the macro being pasted from another page multiple times).\n\nWhat are the replacement endpoints?\n\nHere is a list of recommended replacements.\n\nWhat are the differences between the old and new endpoints?\n\nWe have tried to make the new endpoints as compatible as possible with the previous ones, however there are some breaking changes:\n\nBy default, the endpoint will only return Issue IDs. Unless requested, all other issue fields will be omitted in the Issue objects. You can request them by using the fields property.\n\nThe endpoint doesnât provide immediate search after write consistency. Search results may not incorporate recent changes made by users. If this behaviour is important for your case, please refer to the migration path at the end of this page. The delay for updates to be visible in search is dependent on various factors. The majority of modifications are typically visible within seconds. However, operations that impact numerous issues, such as lexorank rebalancing or bulk editing, may require more time to complete.\n\nThe validationMode parameter is removed and validation will work as none.\n\nWeâll replace random page access with a continuation token API. This means you wonât be able to get multiple pages at the same time with parallel threads. startAt parameter will be replaced with nextPageToken.\n\nWe will only return a maximum of 20 comments and 40 changelog items. If you require more, please refer to the migration guide at the end of this page.\n\nThe endpoint wonât accept unbounded JQL query and will return 400 if an unbounded JQL query is provided.\n\nMore details available here â https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-is-advanced-search-in-jira-cloud/#Types-of-JQL\n\nAdditionally, weâre introducing two new endpoints to complete the solution:\n\nhttps://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issue-search/#api-rest-api-3-search-approximate-count-post\n\nhttps://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issues/#api-rest-api-3-issue-bulkfetch-post\n\nGuidance for migration\n\nHow can I fetch data from lots of issues at once?\n\nThis operation may be achieved by using two Jira endpoints:\n\nGet issue IDs via /rest/api/3/search/jql\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 curl

application/json' \\ --header 'Accept: application/json' \\ --data '{ \"issueIdsOrKeys\": [\"FOO-1\",\"10067\", \"BAR-1\"], \"fields\": [\"priority\", \"status\", \"summary\"] }'\n\nHow can I get issues' fields for known Issue IDs?\n\nYou can use the Bulk Fetch Issue endpoint:\n\nPOST to /rest/api/{2|3|latest}/issue/bulkfetch\n\nExample request:\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 curl --location 'https://example-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/latest/issue/bulkfetch' \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ --header 'Accept: application/json' \\ --data '{ \"issueIdsOrKeys\": [\"FOO-1\",\"10067\", \"BAR-1\"], \"fields\": [\"priority\", \"status\", \"summary\"] }'\n\nHow do I find out how many issues match my JQL?\n\nYou can use approximate count endpoint:\n\nPOST /rest/api/3/search/approximate-count\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 curl --location 'https://example-jira.atlassian.net/rest/api/latest/search/approximate-count' \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ --header 'Accept: application/json' \\ --data '{ \"jql\":\"project in (FOO, BAR)\" }'\n\nResponse\n\n1 2 3 { \"count\": 3 }\n\nYou can use the JQL Parse endpoint:\n\nPOST /rest/api/3/jql/parse\n\n1 2

{ \"value\": \"BAR\", \"encodedValue\": \"BAR\" } ], \"encodedOperand\": \"(FOO, BAR)\" } } } } ] }\n\nHow can I get immediate search after write consistency?\n\nWe recommend following Search And Reconcile pattern described here.\n\nHow can I paginate over a large set of results?\n\nPOST /rest/api/3/search/jql\n\nUse next page token returned on each request to get further results\n\n1 2 3 4 5

unbounded JQL query?\n\nWe don't recommend running unbounded JQL queries âÂ they are slow for users and costly for every system involved. As our customers grow in number and size over time, with millions of Jira issues, this trend will continue.\n\nWe strongly recommend you bound your JQL queries to give customers the best performance and reliability. Consider bounding your queries like this:\n\n1 updated > -1m\n\nMore information is available here\n\nWhat is the duration after a change (i.e., write) where search consistency is assured?\n\nThe eventual consistency delay is dependent on various factors. 99% of modifications are typically visible within seconds. However, non organic updates or operations that impact numerous issues, such as lexorank rebalancing or bulk editing, may require more time to complete.\n\nHow do I reach consistency when periodically polling with search?\n\nDepending on your needs, we recommend the following:\n\nPolling with overlapping periods of 5 minutes if you do not rely on non-organic updates.\n\nPolling with overlapping periods of 25 minutes if you do depend on non-organic updates, or if you are depending on results of operations that impact numerous issues.\n\nTo increase the level of assurance, we recommend combining the above tactics with the consumption of Webhook events.",

      "# [Learn Git - Tutorials, Workflows and Commands](https://www.atlassian.com/git)\nGit is a free and open-source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Unlike older centralized version control systems such as SVN and CVS, Git is distributed: every developer has the full history of their code repository locally. This makes the initial clone of the repository slower, but subsequent operations such as commit, blame, diff, merge, and log dramatically faster.\n\nGit also has excellent support for branching, merging, and rewriting repository history, which has led to many innovative and powerful workflows and tools. Pull requests are one such popular tool that allows teams to collaborate on Git branches and efficiently review each other's code. Git is the most widely used version control system in the world today and is considered the modern standard for software development.\n\nBranch\n\nDefinition: A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process discussed in Git Basics, the first module of this series. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.",

      "# [What is ITSM? A guide to IT service management](https://www.atlassian.com/itsm)\nAt Atlassian, the team comes first. We’ve even created a team playbook to provide tools that help teams improve how they work. IT teams should be continually learning and improving. They must feel valued and empowered to make a difference in the company.\n\nRather than adhering to rules imposed by tiered reporting structures or rigid processes, IT teams can make informed decisions about adopting SLAs and which software they should implement. Strong IT teams are pivotal in fostering productivity and driving digital transformation, making them indispensable for robust company performance. IT teams are the core of IT Service Management (ITSM) processes and technologies.\n\nAfter focusing on the strength of the IT team, it’s possible to develop unique practices and capabilities to provide value to the company. No matter how reputable the source, it’s insufficient to simply “copy and paste” another company’s set of standards, and hope they will work in your unique environment.\n\nSuccessful IT teams craft their approach by drawing from frameworks like ITIL (the Information Technology Infrastructure Library) and carefully adapting processes to align with the needs and preferences of their customers.\n\nFinally, software and technology should support a team’s practices and amplify their impact. The best ITSM software fosters cross-team collaboration, empowers end-users, and automates mundane or routine tasks—giving everyone more time to focus on what matters most. We've all seen instances where technology becomes a hindrance, introducing unnecessary complexity and frustration.\n\nWhen technology operates seamlessly, it may seem like magic, but in truth, it’s a reflection of the hard work of the teams that use it.\n\nWhat is an IT service?\n\nIn the context of ITSM, an IT service refers to delivering technology-related support and solutions to end-users or customers. This encompasses a wide range of workplace technologies, including laptops, servers, and business-critical software applications. ITSM teams handle requests and incidents related to these services through structured processes, ensuring service efficiency, reliability, and user satisfaction.\n\nWhat is an ITSM framework?\n\nFrameworks are tools that provide ITSM with standardized practices and procedures. Frameworks can provide a platform that monitors continuous improvement for service delivery and support.\n\nITSM is an IT service management framework that provides services for various IT functions. It defines operating procedures, techniques, and supporting services that deliver efficiency and value to an underlying system's operation. Frameworks help companies define their ITSM strategy.\n\nPopular ITSM frameworks\n\nIT teams use a variety of frameworks to guide their work. The two most common are ITSM and DevOps. Other concepts include COBIT, SIAM, IT4IT, lean, and more.\n\nBelow, we’ll cover two of the most influential frameworks for modern IT teams—ITSM and DevOps—along with a common approach to ITSM. Let’s start by defining some key terms:\n\nITSM\n\nAs mentioned above, IT Service Management is how IT teams manage the delivery of IT services to customers. How a team approaches ITSM can be structured to align with ITIL practices and influenced by DevOps concepts.\n\nITIL\n\nITIL is the most widely accepted approach to ITSM. ITIL focuses on practices for aligning IT services with business needs. ITIL can help companies adapt to ongoing transformation and scale.\n\nITIL 4, the recent update to ITIL standards, represents a paradigm shift for IT teams. It guides teams to a holistic, business, and customer-value frame of reference and encourages a more flexible approach based on how your team works. The ITIL 4 Guiding Principles promote collaboration, simplicity, and feedback.\n\nPeople sometimes misrepresent ITIL as “the rules” rather than guidance, but that's open to interpretation. Just because we need to use processes and document work doesn’t mean we should generate cumbersome masses of records and bureaucratic overhead. There is no excuse for hiding behind processes or the ITIL “rules.”\n\nDevOps\n\nDevOps emphasizes accelerated IT service delivery enabled by agile and lean practices. DevOps improves collaboration between software development and IT operations teams so companies can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably. Notable benefits include increased trust, faster software releases, quickly solving critical issues, and better managing unplanned work.\n\nThough DevOps includes continuous development, integration, and automated delivery, the concept is based on building a culture of collaboration between teams that historically functioned in relative siloes. Much of the context and ethos behind DevOps is about moving away from old divisions and working together. Unfortunately, people often see this pertaining to just ‘Dev’ and not ‘Ops.’\n\nPeople typically pitch ITSM and DevOps against each other as an ‘either/or’ decision – “we are an ITSM or a DevOps house.” There is confusion about what ITSM and DevOps deliver and how they could work together. Modern, high-performing teams realize they need to be able to work both smarter and quicker but still require process and control.\n\nIt’s time to move beyond the ITSM vs DevOps ultimatum and use elements of both—whether you explicitly follow frameworks or not. DevOps is much more than just automated development and promotes the importance of collaboration and a blame-free culture. Moreover, ITSM and the ITIL approach shouldn’t be pigeonholed as an administrative burden but used in an agile way to fit different companies' unique needs.\n\nWhy is ITSM important?\n\nITSM benefits your IT team, and service management principles can improve your entire company. ITSM leads to efficiency and productivity gains. A structured approach to service management also aligns IT with business goals, standardizing the delivery of services based on budgets, resources, and results. It reduces costs and risks and ultimately improves the customer experience.\n\nSome of the most common benefits of ITSM include:\n\nAligning IT teams with business priorities tracked through success metrics\n\nEnabling cross-team collaboration\n\nBringing IT teams and development teams together through streamlined project management approaches\n\nEmpowering IT teams to share knowledge and continuously improve\n\nImproving request coordination for more efficient service\n\nPromoting customer-centricity with self-service and better processes\n\nResponding more quickly to major incidents, and preventing future ones\n\nAll of which decrease costs and lead to better service, as well as enhanced employee and customer satisfaction.\n\nITSM processes and services\n\nITIL 4 recently shifted from recommending ITSM “processes” to introduce 34 ITSM “practices.” Their reasoning for this updated terminology is so that “elements such as culture, technology, information, and data management can be considered to get a holistic vision of the ways of working.” This comprehensive approach better reflects the realities of modern companies.\n\nHere, we won’t worry about the differences in terminology. What’s important, regardless of your team's framework, is that modern IT service teams use resources and follow repeatable procedures to deliver consistent, efficient service. In fact, leveraging practice or process is what distinguishes ITSM from IT.\n\nOutlined below are some of the core ITSM processes:\n\nService request management\n\nService request management is a repeatable procedure for handling a wide variety of customer service requests, including requests for access to applications, software enhancements, and hardware updates. The service request workstream often involves recurring requests and benefits greatly from enabling customers with knowledge and automating certain tasks.\n\nKnowledge management\n\nKnowledge management is the process of creating, sharing, using, and managing a company’s knowledge and information. It refers to a multidisciplinary approach to achieving company objectives by making the best use of knowledge.\n\nIT asset management\n\nIT asset management (also known as ITAM) ensures a company’s assets are accounted for, deployed, maintained, upgraded, and properly disposed of when the time comes. In short, it's the process of ensuring that valuable items, whether tangible or intangible, are being tracked and used correctly.\n\nIncident management\n\nIncident management is the process of responding to an unplanned event or service interruption and restoring the service to its operational state. Considering all the software services businesses rely on today, there are more potential failure points than ever, so this process must be ready to quickly respond to and resolve issues.\n\nProblem management\n\nProblem management is the process of identifying and managing the causes of incidents within an IT service. Problem management is not only about identifying and resolving incidents but also finding and understanding the underlying causes of an incident and identifying the best method for eliminating the root causes.\n\nChange management\n\nChange management ensures standard procedures are used for efficient and prompt handling of all IT infrastructure changes, whether rolling out new services, managing existing ones, or resolving problems in the code. Effective change management provides the context and visibility necessary to avoid bottlenecks and minimize risk.\n\nITSM software and tools\n\nITSM software enables IT teams to align with business needs and take a strategic approach to change, transformation, and growth. A wide variety of ITSM software tools are available in the market, from standalone applications to platform services.\n\nWe often hear IT teams complain that the traditional ITSM systems and tools they use are inflexible and, consequently, difficult to customize and adapt to evolving requirements. There also tend to be different tools for the various ITSM processes.\n\nModular tools create barriers, silo end users, and cause a lack of visibility across teams. Traditional ITSM tools are often difficult to deploy and manage, leaving end users to adopt tools that aren’t intuitive, which also leads to deficient or non-existent self-service ITSM capabilities.\n\nChoosing the right service desk software for your business is critical, as the service desk is the foundation of a robust ITSM solution. The service desk serves as the interface between customers and the IT team.\n\nITIL itself defines a service desk as “the single point of contact between the service provider and the users. A typical service desk manages incidents and service requests, and also handles communication with the users.”\n\nThe service desk should also play an important role in managing other ITSM practices. Consider whether your service desk and other ITSM tools meet the following requirements:\n\nEasy to use and set up: Comes with a clean, intuitive self-service portal that makes it easy to request help, search for knowledge, and track progress on issues.\n\nEnables collaboration: Provides a platform for developers and cross-functional teams to work together for faster issue resolution.\n\nAdapts to your needs: Is flexible enough to support any resolution, escalation, or change process your IT teams might dream up.\n\nThe choice of service desk software is pivotal, as it forms the foundation of a robust ITSM solution, serving as the interface between customers and the IT team. Jira Service Management stands out as a solution that addresses these challenges, offering an easy-to-use self-service portal, facilitating collaboration among teams, and providing the flexibility needed to support diverse IT resolution, escalation, and change processes.\n\nAccelerating value with collaborative ITSM strategies\n\nITSM stands at the center of modernizing companies. As the rise of software-powered services accelerates, IT service teams enable employees and teams across companies to deliver value more quickly. The role of the IT team has transformed from supporting the business to actively differentiating the business itself. It’s time to move toward approaches to ITSM that emphasize collaboration, ease of use, and faster value delivery.\n\nJira Service Management is a valuable platform for ITSM initiatives. It not only supports seven essential ITSM practices but also provides a comprehensive ITSM template. This template facilitates the implementation of key service management workflows, ensuring a quick and efficient start to ITSM processes. By seamlessly integrating with collaborative practices and emphasizing ease of use, Jira Service Management is a strategic tool for IT teams looking to enhance their ITSM strategies and drive value at an accelerated pace.",

They want me to find training. We primarily use Jira JSM, Confluence, and OpsGenie, amongst others. \n\nI checked older posts here but most of them are old.

I've been a Jira project admin for years and I still learn something new almost every day, but my company still doesn't believe it should be a \"real job\".\n\nNothing against you, OP, I'm jealous :) I learned (and still learn) by reading the Atlassian community posts, by taking the (now free) courses at Atlassian University, and simply by doing. Good luck to you!\n\n### Comment ID ldrnb60 with +1 score by [(plaguen0g, Reddit, 2024-07-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/atlassian/comments/1e5te54/atlassian_jira_confluence_etc_training/ldrnb60/) (in reply to ID ldrhhq2):\nI've been using Jira and Confluence off and on for a dozen years and am pretty comfortable with it.

Costs are rising everywhere and I was asked to look into cheaper viable alternatives. Any thoughts?\n\nContext:\nEngineering org of about 250 people \nCurrent use of Jira is pretty standard, confluence mainly for documentation (private and for emerging concepts which have not made it to the ‘official’ documentation yet) and exchange of information/ thoughts. Users are mainly software architects, enterprise architects, devs, qa, etc. \n\n\nThanks\n\n## Comment ID j5tkelx with +108 score by [(Tee_zee, Reddit, 2023-01-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/10ksowi/alternative_to_atlassian_jira_and_confluence/j5tkelx/) (in reply to ID 10ksowi):\nDon’t underestimate the time to build, migrate, and upskill everyone when choosing an alternative\n\n### Comment ID j5wbbgm with +14 score by [(Am3n, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/10ksowi/alternative_to_atlassian_jira_and_confluence/j5wbbgm/) (in reply to ID j5tkelx):\nThis, even though Jira pains me to no end, its industry standard for a reason\n\n#### Comment ID j5wbv1k with +6 score by [(linucksrox, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/10ksowi/alternative_to_atlassian_jira_and_confluence/j5wbv1k/) (in reply to ID j5wbbgm):\nI wish I understood that reason...\n\n### Comment ID j5wlij0 with +3 score by [(SAmerica89, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/10ksowi/alternative_to_atlassian_jira_and_confluence/j5wlij0/) (in reply to ID j5tkelx):\nMigrate is especially huge since you’ll likely lose a lot of valuable data doing it.

He wants to move away from Jira to ServiceNow because he harbors some very strongly-held philosophical beliefs about working for SaaS companies and working with cloud-based workflows. \n\nHe’s been at the company two months. I’ve seen multiple people come through here trying to do what he wants to do, completely oblivious or ambivalent to how much of the rest of the business have workflows tied into Jira.

Premium functionalities for Jira itself are not worth it for most companies and if we are talking about large organizations, they usually skip directly to enterprise.\n\nWhile, at the same time, for JSM most of our customers already have premium (mainly because of Assets included). Standard is usually used by smaller companies with rather small to no focus on service management in general (or they have it implemented somewhere else already). So as of these functionalities I consider them rather “advanced” in terms of for what companies usually use their helpdesks for.

If you wish working contract style and “mostly on your own” I can think of looking for partner from different country - you need 8 certified individuals to reach platinum status but you reach platinum in all countries you have your people in.

I'm obviously not an Atlassian user--and I only have a vague idea of what this software is used for--so I apologize if my terminology is a little wonky. Earlier today, I discovered that my Gmail account was sharing data with atlassian.com. I never gave permission for any such data-sharing--nor do I work for a company that uses its products--but I do have an abusive ex-husband with a known history of hacking my online accounts. His sister works for a company that uses Atlassian software, and I'm fearful that my personal information (current address, phone number, etc) may have been compromised.\n\nSo, here are my questions: Is there an easy explanation for how/why my Gmail account would have been sending data to Atlassian without my knowledge/permission? Is data-sharing between the two companies standard practice or something?  If not, how could this software have been linked to my account?  (I apologize if these are silly questions...I am NOT tech savvy at all!)\n\nI've sent an email to Atlassian inquiring about the same topics, but I'm admittedly a little freaked out by the posibility that my ex might know where I am. I'm hoping that it's just my anxiety getting the best of me...and I'm also hoping that my fellow Redditors might put my mind at ease while I'm awaiting an answer from the 'official' source!

This feels very predatory, I don't know how to stop it. When it says \"manage\" it takes me to a place where I manage my billing but its blank. No ability to delete. When i try to pick a plan it wont let me hover over to \"free\", it says that's what i already have but i obviously don't. It asks my to trial premium also when I'm already doing that.

Best is to contact their support before its too late directly through support.atlassian.com.\n\nNext - Jira did not sign you for premium by itself. You probably clicked somewhere on “Try premium” button (theres lots of them lately..). Even if you get free Jira tier, there is monthly “billing date” set - its just free so they dont require you fill any info about billing address etc. Once you add any paid product to your roganization, it will start 14 - 30 day trial and ask you to fill billing info before your next “billing date”, otherwise they might forcibly downgrade your instance to free tier (if possible), or lock your instance entirely, if downgrade is not possible. Because you have just 1 user, you should be able to get back to Free tier without a problem. Btw. there is no way to pay for premium for example just for one month. You pay for what you use, but you can switch editions as much as you like. At the given “billing date” you will always be asked to pay for what is currently active. Nothing more and nothing less. I dont see anything predatory on this.\n\n### Comment ID lhn6gv7 with +1 score by [(throwaway_helpp123, Reddit, 2024-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/atlassian/comments/1eptlu3/jira_signed_me_up_for_autorenew_premium_without/lhn6gv7/) (in reply to ID lhmzqr7):\nI looked into it and realized that when i logged into Atlassian (it recognized my account and said welcome back so i thought i was logging in) it was actually making a new second product when i already had one free one. I did not click on any \"Try premium\" button, it automatically registered my second product as a premium one, probably because if you have more than one you have to start paying. I did not know this, nor did i mean to make this second product. It making all these assumptions for me is predatory, and i cannot delete the second product until the subscription runs out (September 10th) because it keeps saying \"there's an invoice associated with this account\".

In my time there, I went through 2 re-orgs and 3 managers. It just always felt like being on a hamster wheel… in a hurricane. Today I received an email 7 weeks after I was laid off that started with, “ Congrats on your first year at Atlassian—we know that's a huge accomplishment and are beyond thrilled to be celebrating with you!” It was a bummer to receive that, to say the least, but it included a link to leave this Glassdoor review to “ help provide invaluable insight to future candidates and help us to improve your experience as an employee continually.” so here I am. My advice is to do proper change management of your automated emails when you layoff 5% of your workforce so that emails like this aren’t sent to hard working former employees that you eliminated congratulating them on a milestone they never reached. I know this wasn’t intentional, but it hurt.",

You can fill those seats with new graduates who don't know any better, but they'll reach the same conclusions eventually.\n\nYou built a great company and you're slowly destroying it. I've never seen anyone burn through as much good will as you did starting in 2023.\n\nI hope things improve. I'd still be there if not for those bad changes.

It’s truly an art form here. If you're not on a PIP, are you even really working? The company’s commitment to ensuring everyone feels the thrill of living on the edge is truly admirable. It's like a rite of passage—every month brings a fresh wave of anxiety and excitement. Who needs job security when you can have constant, gut-wrenching uncertainty?\n\nNow, about the PR count. Atlassian has managed to turn code reviews into a competitive sport. Forget about writing clean, functional code. It’s all about the numbers, baby! Your worth here is measured in pull requests like you’re a racehorse on a track. The more, the better, right? Never mind if the quality suffers—what’s important is hitting that next PR milestone. And, oh, the thrill of having your PR comments count scrutinized as if each one were a personal reflection of your professional worth!\n\nAnd let’s not forget the working environment. The long hours and relentless pace make it feel like you’re in a corporate version of The Hunger Games. Survival of the fittest becomes your daily mantra as you navigate through a battlefield of endless tasks and shifting priorities. It’s a test of endurance where every day feels like a quest to avoid the next corporate elimination.\n\nIn summary, if you’re looking for a job where you can feel perpetually on edge, where your every PR is tallied and analyzed, and where the work environment resembles a high-stakes survival game, Atlassian is your dream destination.",

People that I worked with were welcoming and truly living the Atlassian values.\n\nOvertime, the culture turned backwards, no more recharge days and they introduced more and more performance metrics to measure us against each other. People are more anxious and in a race to increase their PR counts. There is also a strong focus on proving your individual contributions, hence we need to constantly collect evidences on our work and impact. All of this combine leads to a never ending burn out. \n\nIf you already in a job that you enjoy and considering Atlassian, I would advise to really rethink if the salary and advertised benefits are really worth your mental health. Also the benefit policies are constantly changing, so they might not be as great in the coming future.",

But, if the “leadership” is a few months late to provide an update we’re only told that “they’re working on it”. The same applies to the company's abrupt transition from extremely aggressive hiring to lay-offs within a two month period, there was no acknowledgement of potential errors that may have occurred. - In the past few months, the executives' tone of voice has shifted to somewhat passive-aggressive. Sure, it’s difficult macroeconomic conditions, but there’s better ways to communicate that we need to switch strategy. At least for the organisation that Atlassian was aspiring to be. - A lot of toxic positivity, especially from the middle managers. Every re-org is celebrated like it was the the best decision ever. It's especially annoying with more challenging announcements like purging the Development Manager role. - Your career and overall well-being are heavily dependent on your direct manager. If you're fortunate, you have the potential to advance significantly, but if you're unlucky, you'll experience a burnout. And too many good people have become miserable because of bad managers at Atlassian. It’s basically impossible to escalate a conflict with your manager.",

Unfortunately, the environment here isn’t great. With the recent shift in company culture, there’s a high chance of landing in a toxic team.\n\nIf you’re happy at your current job and just looking to boost your income, think twice before coming here. This place can be mentally tough if you end up in a team that tracks everything—like PR counts and comment metrics etc. What’s labeled as ‘growth’ , feel more like moving goalposts and make people feeling bad about themselves.\n\nMany of my teammates are feeling stressed and hopeless in different ways. If you’re considering a job change for the money alone and already have a role you enjoy, take a moment to rethink. The job market isn’t great right now, so it might be better to explore side gigs instead of risking your main job and your mental health. I hope this helps!",

When times got tough, the values were jettisoned and new people were brought in who’ve driven it further into the ground. Senior Meta and Amazon hires have been the worst thing for the company. People creating personal fiefdoms and just driving good people out. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, Atlassian always had problems, but they were more about a culture of shipping barely functional MVPs and moving on to the next thing. And the reorgs… It was like a dog spotting squirrels every five minutes. But it was worth it because the people were great and really tried to live the values. That’s gone now and there’s very little left to like.\n\nNew programs are rolled out and, when people inevitably complain about the tin-eared approach, the response is “trust us, bruh.”",

You will likely not learn very much as a DS, but you will become an expert in one thing (be it experimentation, dashboard design, business performance, etc). DS added new leaders in 2023 which I'm a fan of; new leader seems very pragmatic and results-oriented.\n\nVery little source of truth in company data.\n\nI also have found individuals able to go in-office more frequently are getting promotions, more interesting projects.\n\nManagers: I've had mostly good managers here. However, the bar changed (or I just got unlucky). Latest managers have lots of experience with big name FAANG / corps, but not good communicators, very vague, say one thing but then do another. They seem to be viewed as good managers only if they work around the clock and attend 100 meetings a week.\n\nCareer opportunities: promotions are hard, and 99% of the work is on the IC to put together their case. DS growth profiles haven't been updated in 4 years.\n\nLatest hires (including management) don't seem to be as aware of, nor celebrate, longstanding company values.",

As soon as a feature is made, they don’t support it and rush to make a new one in order to show it in new reports.\n\nIn the last year, APEX was introduced, this is a system that evaluates developers.

After more than eight years with the company, it's disheartening to witness such a decline. The new rating system is unfair, downgrading employees despite their hard work. Unless you're working 25(yes 25)/7, you won't receive a decent rating, you aren't demonstrating much 'Org impact.'\n\nBeing a woman in tech is challenging, but being a mother in tech is even tougher. Despite the generous maternity leave policy, many new mothers, including myself, have received unfair poor performance reviews, leading many to leave the company. During my time here, I've experienced over three reorganizations and countless white male managers. When I finally had a manager who supported my goals for promotion, they were let go.\n\nWe’ve become worse than Meta, preaching admirable values but living in a 'Hunger Games' environment. At least with Meta, you know what to expect. The pressure to merge a certain number of PRs affects both performance evaluations and mental health. With everyone rushing to merge PRs, it's an incredibly stressful race—ironic for a company that preaches work-life balance. Asking for help in public channels often leads to management questioning your abilities; I’ve seen it happen repeatedly. Bringing concerns to HR feels like talking into the void. Lastly, We used to have free insurance, but now that benefit is going away. I used to love working here, but now I dread every day.",

It puts so much pressure on you to stand out above your peers and as a result creates a crab bucket mentality and causes so much stress over whether you are hitting each quantifiable metric.\n\n- Pay isn't overly fair and transparent. Some roles are considerably overpaid for the work involved and others are underpaid compared to what is expected of them, and there's no real pay transparency. Even within teams pay isn't often fairly distributed among team members.\n\n- Poor growth opportunities. Numerous \"growth paths\" are documented but actually achieving those is often near impossible and opportunities in other teams are very limited despite internal mobility processes.\n\n- Benefits &amp; culture moving towards just being \"industry standard\" rather than wanting to stand out as industry leaders. Lots of petty cost cutting (despite spending tens of millions of dollars on events like TEAM and RKO every year) has harmed staff moral further.",

They hire their mates. \n\nNo innovation AT ALL - everything they do is just a copy of whats in the market. Look at their whiteboard, even called the same as a product in market. 2 free products is all that has been released in the last 10 years and they are poor at best, Atlas and Product Discovery. Where is the next revenue stream? Its not coming from Data Centre moving to Cloud. All growth is through acquisition. No new customers moving to cloud so their out look is not so good.",

In my time there, I went through 2 re-orgs and 3 managers. It just always felt like being on a hamster wheel… in a hurricane. Today I received an email 7 weeks after I was laid off that started with, “ Congrats on your first year at Atlassian—we know that's a huge accomplishment and are beyond thrilled to be celebrating with you!” It was a bummer to receive that, to say the least, but it included a link to leave this Glassdoor review to “ help provide invaluable insight to future candidates and help us to improve your experience as an employee continually.” so here I am. My advice is to do proper change management of your automated emails when you layoff 5% of your workforce so that emails like this aren’t sent to hard working former employees that you eliminated congratulating them on a milestone they never reached.

Sure, it’s difficult macroeconomic conditions, but there’s better ways to communicate that we need to switch strategy. At least for the organisation that Atlassian was aspiring to be. - A lot of toxic positivity, especially from the middle managers. Every re-org is celebrated like it was the the best decision ever. It's especially annoying with more challenging announcements like purging the Development Manager role. - Your career and overall well-being are heavily dependent on your direct manager. If you're fortunate, you have the potential to advance significantly, but if you're unlucky, you'll experience a burnout.

However, the bar changed (or I just got unlucky). Latest managers have lots of experience with big name FAANG / corps, but not good communicators, very vague, say one thing but then do another. They seem to be viewed as good managers only if they work around the clock and attend 100 meetings a week.\n\nCareer opportunities: promotions are hard, and 99% of the work is on the IC to put together their case.

Unless you're working 25(yes 25)/7, you won't receive a decent rating, you aren't demonstrating much 'Org impact.'\n\nBeing a woman in tech is challenging, but being a mother in tech is even tougher. Despite the generous maternity leave policy, many new mothers, including myself, have received unfair poor performance reviews, leading many to leave the company. During my time here, I've experienced over three reorganizations and countless white male managers. When I finally had a manager who supported my goals for promotion, they were let go.\n\nWe’ve become worse than Meta, preaching admirable values but living in a 'Hunger Games' environment. At least with Meta, you know what to expect. The pressure to merge a certain number of PRs affects both performance evaluations and mental health. With everyone rushing to merge PRs, it's an incredibly stressful race—ironic for a company that preaches work-life balance. Asking for help in public channels often leads to management questioning your abilities; I’ve seen it happen repeatedly. Bringing concerns to HR feels like talking into the void. Lastly, We used to have free insurance, but now that benefit is going away. I used to love working here, but now I dread every day.",

People are more anxious and in a race to increase their PR counts. There is also a strong focus on proving your individual contributions, hence we need to constantly collect evidences on our work and impact. All of this combine leads to a never ending burn out. \n\nIf you already in a job that you enjoy and considering Atlassian, I would advise to really rethink if the salary and advertised benefits are really worth your mental health.

      "# [The *new* Jira is here by Dave Meyer on 2024-10-18](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/the-new-jira)\nAt Team ‘24 in Las Vegas, we unveiled the next evolution of Jira – a shared place for every team to align on goals and priorities, track and collaborate on work, and get the insights they need to build something incredible, together.\n\nToday, we’re excited to announce new features (and a new look!) that make Jira easier, more flexible, and more powerful for all types of work – helping transform siloed companies into connected ones.\n\nLet’s take a look!\n\nMore flexibility, for more teams\n\nNo matter the team you’re on, Jira embraces the little things that make teams unique, while keeping you connected to the people, plans and information you need to deliver great work together.\n\nLet’s check out the new ways Jira is bringing more flexibility and customization to support any team’s work style.\n\nImproved navigation, customized for you\n\nSoon we’ll be rolling out a new, customizable navigation experience that brings the most relevant work to your fingertips. From goals, to plans, to projects, and more, a new sidebar gives you quick and easy access to the most important information from your team and across the company. Plus you can personalize it! Reorder items by importance, pin relevant work, and hide what you don’t need.\n\nAlong with the new sidebar, we’re also introducing a simplified top navigation that brings AI-powered search front and center. AI-powered search helps surface the most relevant information from across Jira, Confluence, and other Atlassian apps. That means less time wasted hunting things down, and more time to get s#!t done.\n\nWe think you’ll love this simplified navigation so much, we’re rolling it out across all Atlassian products for a consistent experience.\n\nMore pieces of flair\n\nWish Jira better reflected your team spirit? With new background colors, images, and card covers, now your team can truly make Jira feel like home. Personalize Jira to reflect your team vibes (we’re more of a cute dogs-in-hats kind of team).\n\nSpeaking of flair, we also added a confetti cannon to celebrate any time you move a work item to done.\n\nNo more issues\n\nNot every thing you work on is an issue (anymore). With more teams making Jira their home for work, we’re retiring ‘issues’ as our default name for work in Jira. Instead of referring to ‘issues,’ you choose how you refer to your work – whether that’s a “launch”, a “task” or even an “issue”.\n\nCustom project templates to scale your team’s way of working\n\nFor scaling enterprises, consistency is key. With custom project templates (one of Jira’s most requested features), soon you’ll be able to create reusable project templates for your organization with pre-configured workflows, automations, fields, permissions, and more. With custom project templates, it’s easy to scale processes you want to standardize – from marketing campaigns, to HR onboarding processes, and more.\n\nMaking AI work for Jira users\n\nAtlassian Intelligence (AI) in Jira empowers teams to be their best. Here are a few new AI-powered features in Jira that will enable teams to work smarter.\n\nSave time creating work items\n\nWith AI work creation, easily identify and create work in Jira right from a Confluence page. Just highlight the text and AI will suggest a task that you can create directly from the page. And soon, AI work creation will be even more powerful. You will be able to create single work items from Slack messages, or even use AI to scan an entire Confluence page for action items and bulk transform them into multiple work items.\n\nAutomatically create work items from Loom video\n\nMore of a visual communicator? With Loom AI workflows, you can easily turn any Loom recording into a work item in Jira. Simply record a Loom, click “create an issue,” and Loom AI will generate a detailed work item for your Jira project based on the video transcript. Now you can go from unstructured thought to structured work in seconds.\n\nBreak down work in a click\n\nWith Jira’s new work breakdown feature, AI helps you break down large projects into individual tasks automatically. Simply create a work item and AI will recommend relevant subtasks that you can approve in a click! Now you can spend less time breaking work down, and more time moving work forward.\n\nStay aligned every step of the way\n\nYour engineers, marketers, designers, and other teams may all work differently, but they should still be aligned to shared objectives. Bringing every team into Jira makes it easier for leaders to set goals, align teams to priorities, and track the success of every project in flight.\n\nGoals, everywhere\n\nPreviewed earlier this year, Goals are now generally available in Jira. Broader availability across Atlassian is in early access, with a full rollout to all customers in the coming months (opt-in here). To help keep your priorities front and center, Goals can be viewed in the list, timeline, calendar, and issue views. You can also now filter by Goals.\n\nThis one’s for you, program managers\n\nWe’re also introducing a new board view within Plans called the program board. This new, drag-and-drop interface allows you to coordinate a program of work and its dependencies across multiple teams on a customizable cadence.\n\nYour next great idea starts with Jira\n\nWe can’t wait for you to check out the new ways we’re making Jira easier, more powerful, and more flexible for every team’s working style.\n\nWith all teams on the same tool, and on the same page, building something incredible together has never been easier.",
      "# [Welcome Wednesday: #AtlassianCreators by Jimmy Seddon, community.atlassian.com, user-id on 2024-05-29](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Welcome-Center-articles/Welcome-Wednesday-AtlassianCreators/ba-p/2702144)\nHappy Wednesday Everyone!\n\nBack in the April Community Round-up I mentioned that sign ups were open for the Atlassian Creators program. If you don’t know what that is, it’s passionate individuals who love making helpful guides and tutorials on various social media platforms to help users of the Atlassian products learn how to use the software.\n\nHow do you find these wonderful people? Look for the #AtlassianCreator tag on LinkedIn, X/Twitter, YouTube, etc.\n\nIn fact many if not all of them are right here in the online Community! If you are an Atlassian Creator, jump in the comments and let people know what you make content about and where they can find you.\n\nHave a great rest of the week everyone!",

We gather data on these changes to determine if they’re ready to release to all organizations.\n\nFor organizations with an Enterprise plan, you can choose to get experiments so you can influence Atlassian's product development through testing. Or prevent experiments rolling out to your organization because you need to ensure changes are planned for ahead of time.\n\nLearn about Atlassian experiments\n\nFilter the user list with added roles\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve updated the users list in the Atlassian Administration Directory. You can now filter the user list by new roles that have been split into multiple dropdown menus instead of one.\n\nThe roles we’re introducing include:\n\nCompass basic\n\nJira Service Management stakeholder and customer\n\nJira Product Discovery contributor\n\nTo filter the user list by roles:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com.

Learn more about the centralized user management\n\nMake it easy and secure for customers to log in to your help center with single sign-on\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you connect an identity provider to your Jira Service Management site, you can authenticate your customers with SAML single sign-on (SSO).\n\nBefore you begin\n\nYou must subscribe to Atlassian Access from your organization before you set up SAML single sign-on. Learn more about how to start with Atlassian Access\n\nTo set up SAML SSO for portal-only customers:\n\nGo to Settings > Products.\n\nUnder Jira Service Management, select Authentication.\n\nSelect Add identity provider.\n\nFollow the prompts to complete the setup.\n\nLearn more about SAML single sign-on for portal-only customers\n\nBrand your Jira products with a custom domain\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now use custom domains to brand your Jira products.

Tell me more about custom domains\n\nTo create a custom domain:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Products > Product URLs.\n\nSelect Add custom domain. This is only visible if you have an eligible product.\n\nReview the Before you add a custom domain page, and select Next.\n\nSelect which product you want to access from your custom domain.\n\nFollow the prompts to specify your domain. You’ll need to enter two subdomains and a domain.\n\nEnter a Redirect URL. This is optional.\n\nReview changes and select Create domain.\n\nConnect Microsoft Azure AD to Atlassian with an option that works for you\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you connect your Microsoft Azure AD identity provider to an Atlassian organization, you now have two options.\n\nOption 1: Manually set up user provisioning\n\nRecommended when you need:\n\nflexibility in setting up your Microsoft Azure Active Directory identity provider with SCIM and SAML\n\nto sync groups and users with no flattening of nested group structure\n\nto sync when you add users to your Azure AD\n\nLearn how to add an identity provider for this option\n\nOption 2: Automatically set up user provisioning\n\nRecommended when you need:\n\neasy set up by allowing access to groups and users in your Microsoft Azure Active Directory\n\nto flatten your nested group structure and keep group memberships\n\nto sync automatically (every 4 hours)\n\nLearn more about Azure AD for nested groups\n\nTo connect your identity provider:\n\n1. Go to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\n2. Select Security > Identity providers.\n\nLearn more about identity providers\n\nFind Atlassian Administration settings faster\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now avoid searching every page of the Atlassian administration looking for what you need. We’ve added a new search field. From this field, you can enter a top or left navigation page title and select the page you want from the results.\n\nTo use the Administration search field:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect the search field in the top right.\n\nEnter the page title.\n\nSelect the page you want.\n\nRetiring the possibility to manage the atlassian-addons-project-access role\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nFollowing up on our previous announcement, we’re planning to remove the possibility to manage the atlassian-addons-project-access role in two to six months. The exact date depends on the feedback we receive after this announcement.\n\nBy default, the role is assigned to all project permissions in permission schemes and all issue security levels in issue security schemes. As a result of this change, the possibility to manage that role’s permissions and issue security levels, both via the UI and the REST API, will be restricted.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the planned changes, please leave them under this public ticket.\n\nCreate custom domains for your Jira products\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe removed keyword restrictions when you create custom domains. You will no longer have a fixed list to select keywords for subdomains. Instead, you have the ability to manually enter your own subdomains.\n\nJira family products have also been given added support. You can now select Jira products from the dropdown menu when you create a custom domain.\n\nTo create a custom domain:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com.

This is optional.\n\nReview changes and select Create domain.\n\nData residency for Marketplace apps\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen evaluating data residency for your apps, you might see some apps listed as \"No action available.\"\n\nThis means that some app partners declare that their apps don't need to be pinned or migrated because their apps exclusively store data within the Atlassian product. Another reason is that the apps may not store any data in the scope of the Marketplace partner's data residency policies.\n\nTo request a data residency move for your apps, you will have first to move your product. Learn more about how to move your product from one location to another\n\nOnce your product has been pinned to your selected location, you can move your eligible apps to the same location. Learn more about data residency for Marketplace apps\n\nStay on top of your organization’s security\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe improved the security guide so you can see your security setup in one place.\n\nUnderstand your organization’s mix of users and their login methods at a glance.

For example, inviting teammates, using a template, etc.\n\nThat means it’s easier to know what to do first in Jira Product Discovery so that you’re getting the most out of it.\n\nThe recommendations will show up in the ‘Your work’ part of Jira, and everyone with either a Free, Standard, or Premium plan will see them. You can dismiss them anytime so they stop showing up.\n\nCollapsible transition labels in the New Workflow Editor\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThis is the second small but mighty improvement to the workflow editor so your workflows are easier to read.\n\nThis change adds collapsible transition labels to the new workflow editor for both company-managed and team-managed projects. When you're managing workflows in the new editor, you can hide transition elements to reduce the amount of clutter on your screen. Oh, happy days!\n\nOther small but mighty changes to the workflow editor include:\n\nNew global transitions and lozenges in the New Workflow Editor\n\nNew shared transitions in the New Workflow Editor for company-managed projects\n\nRead our community post about these changes to learn more.\n\nNew global transitions and lozenges in the new workflow editor\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThis is the first small but mighty improvement to the workflow editor so your workflows are easier to read.\n\nThis change specifically targets workflows made using the old editor view. Through customers' feedback, we've heard that when these workflows are opened in the new editor view, they're often hard to read, misaligned, and generally not nice.\n\nTo solve this, we’ve updated how the global transitions and the status lozenges render in the new editor view. See the image for a before/after comparison.\n\nOther small but mighty changes to the workflow editor include:\n\nCollapsable transition labels in the New Workflow Editor\n\nNew shared transitions in the New Workflow Editor for company-managed projects\n\nRead our community post about these changes to learn more.\n\nTemplate recommendations in your Projects directory have a new home\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you click on ‘Projects’ in your top navigation in Jira you land in your Projects directory. Previously, recommended templates were listed at the top of this directory.\n\nNow, the templates we recommend sit to the side. You can display and hide them as before; the main difference is that when you hover over any of the templates, you can see a preview of what that template looks like and how it works.\n\nWe've also changed the logic behind the recommendations so that they’re more specific and useful.\n\nBringing Plans and Overviews together!\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re bringing together the best of Jira Software and Jira Work Management into a single project management tool, so all your teams now have a shared place to get sh*t done.\n\nAs of this release note, we're launching the migration of Overviews in Jira Work Management into Plans in Jira Software.\n\nFind out how this supercharges your planning experience\n\nUse Atlassian Intelligence to define words and acronyms in the issue description\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now use Atlassian Intelligence to define acronyms and one or more words in the issue description. The definitions will be based on information found in connected Confluence spaces.\n\nTo use Atlassian Intelligence to define words:\n\nMake sure the description is in view mode, not edit mode\n\nHighlight words you need defined\n\nSelect Define\n\nDefinitions are only available in view mode in the description.\n\nSimplifying the Toolchain settings page\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThe \"Toolchain\" page within \"Project Settings\" has undergone a transformation! It's now a focused discovery page with a centralized hub for admins to effortlessly discover and install first-party (1P) and third-party (3P) integrations.\n\nThis change means the page will no longer serve its previous function of managing connected tools and opsgenie teams. We've also removed the Edit connections button from the \"Code\" page that previously linked to the \"Toolchain\" page.\n\nIf you need to manage security containers, head to the “Security” page in Jira. From there, you can utilize the connection manager sidebar.\n\nFinally, we've introduced a new Swap container button on the \"On-call\" page. This button replaces the Change connected Opsgenie team button.\n\nImproved search using summary and description fields\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re boosting performance in the issue navigator by changing how the search field works behind the scenes. When using the search field, results will be based on the Summary and Description fields.\n\nBefore this change, results were based on multiple text fields such as Summary, Description, Comments, and any custom text fields, which caused results to be slower to load.\n\nIf you’d prefer to search using text fields, select More + to view additional field filters, then select Text.\n\nTo try it out, head to the issue navigator by going to your project, then select Issues in the sidebar.\n\nNew ways to edit card covers\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNow you can easily choose a color or an attachment, or upload a new card cover.\n\nSelect the action menu on the bottom right and choose \"Edit cover\"\n\nBulk edit issues in Jira list\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nBulk edit up to 1000 issues at one time from your Jira list.\n\nTo bulk edit multiple issues:\n\nSelect multiple issues from your list using the issue checkboxes.\n\nOnce you’ve chosen the issues you’d like to edit, select Edit from the toolbar that appears.\n\nA sidebar will open which allows you to make edits for the shared fields across your selected issues.\n\nView even more issue information from your Jira list\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nView project, groups, cascading select, radio buttons, resolution, and status category information as field columns.\n\nTo view your new fields, scroll the list all the way to the right. You can then organize your fields how you like.\n\nShorter, saveable, downloadable, emailable reports for Assets\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've got a whole bunch of improvements in store for Reports for Assets in this release... Reports are now distinct dashboards, can be saved for ease of access later, can be downloaded, and can even be emailed to you!\n\nInline create for custom CMP boards\n\nYou can now create cards directly on boards with certain custom board filters.\n\nCopy and share a link to your Jira dashboard\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe're adding a \"Copy link\" button to let you share your Jira dashboards in other Atlassian products, such as on a Confluence page, whiteboard, or database. These links can be displayed as a card in Confluence to make it easier to share your Jira data with others.\n\nConfluence sprint retrospectives are now available on company-managed projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe are adding a prompt to company-managed projects to launch a sprint retrospective in Confluence as a whiteboard or page.\n\nPreviously these options were limited to team-managed projects.\n\nWhen you finish a sprint, you'll see an option to collaborate with your team in Confluence using our sprint retrospective templates. You can pick a whiteboard or a page.\n\nCreate multiple help centers on your site to serve different audiences\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nCreate multiple help centers on your Jira Service Management site and customize each of them for your various teams or audiences. Each help center can feature distinct branding, topics, portals, and announcements to effectively cater to specific user groups.\n\nYou need to be a Jira admin to create and manage multiple help centers.\n\nTo create a new help center:\n\nGo to Settings > Products > Jira Service Management > Configuration.\n\nIn the Help center section, select View all help centers.\n\nYou’ll be taken to the help center management page. Select Create help center.\n\nEnter a name and URL slug for your new help center and select Create.\n\nWe've also moved all the help center settings to a single place. Select your avatar from any help center on your site and you can find your requests, profile settings, and customization capabilities in the menu.\n\nGroup notifications in one email\n\nChoose when you want to get notified about issue activity and we’ll group your notifications into one email.\n\nWe’ll group notifications for the same issue into one email. You can then choose how often you want to receive notification emails for an issue.\n\nTo group notifications together:\n\nSelect Settings > Personal settings.\n\nSelect Projects and issues.\n\nTurn on the toggle to the right of Group notification emails together.\n\nUse the dropdown menu to choose how often you want to receive emails.\n\nInline create for boards with query swimlanes in company-managed projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now create cards directly on boards with certain swimlanes configured with JQL.\n\nThis announcement marks our fifth iteration of inline card creation for boards in company-managed projects.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAs part of our ongoing work to speed up the performance and improve the reliability of Assets in Jira Service Management, we're making a few minor UI changes.\n\nThis change involves that little counter at the bottom of the object list - it's getting updated to show a maximum count of 1000 objects, more than that and it'll show 1000+. And if you ever want to see how many more than 1000 that is, then simply select the 1000+ and it'll update to show the full object count. Simple huh? Happy Assets-ing!\n\nGet notified when your issues transition to another status\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIn team-managed projects, users can now receive a separate email when an issue transitions to a different status.\n\nPreviously, users in team-managed projects received the same email regardless of whether an issue was edited or transitioned to another status.\n\nProject admins can now enable a separate email to notify their team when an issue is transitioned. This provides more granular control about email notifications and reduces clutter for users who are only interested in issue transitions.\n\nTo enable email notifications to users when an issue is transitioned:\n\nFrom your project’s sidebar, select Project settings and then Notifications.\n\nSelect Add notification.\n\nUsing the dropdown, search for and select the issue event An issue is updated by a workflow transition (generic event).\n\nSelect the users and roles that will receive this notification.\n\nSelect Add.\n\nMore about customizing notifications in team-managed projects\n\nSmall change to the Automation audit log - we've updated the look and feel of the date picker to make it easier to use.\n\nTo check it out:\n\nNavigate to automation:\n\nFor Confluence automation, go to Confluence settings > Automation\n\nFor Jira automation, go to Jira settings > System > Global automation\n\nSelect Audit log.\n\nSelect Status and choose which statuses you want to filter by.\n\nUse Confluence templates in pages you create in Jira\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you create a Confluence page from a Jira issue, you now have a choice of templates to add to your page.\n\nFrom the Jira issue's drop-down menu, select Create and choose Page. We will start a draft and you'll have the option to choose a template from a list on the right side of the page.\n\nJira’s dot menu will be removed from August 19\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nWe’ve removing the dot menu in Jira to make way for a new and improved command palette.\n\nThe dot menu will be removed across Jira from August 19. For a more seamless experience, users will be able to access the command palette to find work, update their issues, access project and admin settings, and more.\n\nTo get started with the command palette:\n\nOpen the command palette.\n\nIf you’re a Mac user, press command + K to open the command palette.\n\nIf you’re a Windows user, press Ctrl + K to open the command palette.\n\nSearch for commands in the search bar or use a forward slash / to search work.\n\nMore about the command palette\n\nWhy are we removing the dot menu?\n\nJira\n\nROLLING OUT NEW THIS WEEK\n\nWe’ve improved the messaging in errors for calendar releases in business projects to make it clear what’s happening and how to fix it.\n\nMove data between sites with cloud-to-cloud migration\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe're introducing cloud-to-cloud migration to make it easier for you to move users and projects from one cloud site to another. Cloud-to-cloud migration can help you combine data between two or more cloud sites, split a cloud site into multiple cloud sites, duplicate a cloud site, or move specific projects from one cloud site to another.\n\nOrg and site admins can access this feature by logging in to the cloud site you want to move your users and projects from, then going to Settings > System > Migrate cloud site.\n\nThe new global issue create experience is enabled for all instances\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve modernized and optimized the experience to create issues to make it fast and scalable. Note that you won’t be able to switch back to the old experience.\n\nUse the GitHub for Jira app to connect GitHub Enterprise, instead of DVCS\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nJira admins making a new GitHub connection for a new organisation now need to install the GitHub for Jira app. The app functions just like the DVCS Connector, but with better security features and improved performance.\n\nThis only applies to new GitHub connections in new organisations. Existing connections using DVCS are not affected.\n\nLearn more about the GitHub for Jira app.\n\nControl what you see in your products\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nProduct recommendations now have controls, so now you can dismiss them or learn more about why you’re seeing them. These controls are being added to the recommendations in the app switcher menu which means you'll have more control and receive better product recommendations.\n\nYou can select the three dots next to the recommendation to learn why we have recommended it or to dismiss it entirely.\n\nThe recommendation controls will first be released to both Free and Standard teams of up to 50 users. Note: Only admins will be able to add a new product by clicking on the recommendation.\n\nRetiring the possibility to manage the atlassian-addons-project-access role\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nFollowing up on our previous announcement, we’re planning to remove the possibility to manage the atlassian-addons-project-access role in two to six months. The exact date depends on the feedback we receive after this announcement.\n\nBy default, the role is assigned to all project permissions in permission schemes and all issue security levels in issue security schemes. As a result of this change, the possibility to manage that role’s permissions and issue security levels, both via the UI and the REST API, will be restricted.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the planned changes, please leave them under this public ticket.\n\nOrganize and track work against Compass software components\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now link issues to Compass components from any company-managed Jira Software project.\n\nThis helps your team organize and track work in Jira against elements of your software architecture cataloged in Compass – so you can understand the impact of that work; prioritize work more effectively; and find the information you need to get that work done faster.\n\nLearn more about Compass components\n\nSwitch to Compass components (project admins)\n\nIn your project sidebar, select Components.\n\nCheck that Compass components are turned on. Next to Create component, it should say Compass components. If it says Jira components, select it and switch to Compass components.\n\nJira components won't be deleted, and they'll still be visible on issues they were previously linked to. You can switch back to Jira components at any time.\n\nRead the full documentation\n\nLink issues to Compass components\n\nIf you don't have Compass yet:\n\nOn the Components page, select Get Compass free. It'll take a couple of minutes to set up.\n\nOnly site admins can do this; if you're not a site admin, you can send a request to your site admin to get Compass.\n\nIf you have Compass, but don't have any software components:\n\nOn the Components page, select Create component. Compass will open in a new tab.\n\nFill out the information for the new component, including the name, type, owner team, and related source code repository link. Read more about creating Compass components\n\nOpen any issue in your project.\n\nSelect the Components field, and choose the Compass component you want to link to the issue.\n\nThe component and its linked issue will appear on your project's Components page; and you can search for the component in the backlog, boards, and issue navigator.\n\nIf you have Compass, and have software components:\n\nOpen any issue in your project.\n\nSelect the Components field, and choose the Compass component you want to link to the issue.\n\nThe component and its linked issue will appear on your project's Components page; and you can search for the component in the backlog, boards, and issue navigator.\n\nRead the full documentation\n\nPlan the next quarter of work with the Program Increment Planning Board\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nPlans now has an interface to help you plan the next quarter of work.\n\nIntroducing the Program board – a new way for planners to coordinate and align the delivery plans of multiple teams at the team-of-teams level.\n\nCheck out our community post.\n\nConnect pending Bitbucket workspaces on the Code page or the development dialog\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIf someone in your team has begun the process to connect Bitbucket with your Jira site, you can now complete the connection process on the Code page or in the development dialog. You must be a Jira admin to do this.\n\nTo connect pending Bitbucket workspaces on the Code page:\n\nGo to Code in your project menu.\n\nSelect Connect workspace in the blue banner to connect a workspace.\n\nTo connect pending Bitbucket workspaces using the development dialog:\n\nNavigate to an issue in your project.\n\nOpen the development dialog by selecting either a branch, commit, pull request, build, or deployment from the development panel.\n\nSelect Connect workspace in the blue banner to connect a workspace.\n\nRead more about integrating Bitbucket with Jira\n\nUse filters to search and display Jira issues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNow you can use filters to search for Jira issues and display them in a list, without leaving the Confluence page.\n\nThis improvement follows the release that allows you to search for issues using keywords or JQL, and flexibility to add, remove, and reorder fields.\n\nHow to display Jira issues in a list\n\nStart using filters to search for Jira issues:\n\nEdit a Jira description or comment.\n\nType /jira and select Jira issues.\n\nWith Basic selected, use the filters to search by Project, Type, Status, or Assignee.\n\nSelect Insert issues.\n\nThis will display your selected issues in a list format you can interact with.\n\nTo edit your list of Jira issues:\n\nSelect anywhere on the list.\n\nSelect the Edit button (left-most icon) from the menu that appears at the bottom of the table.\n\nEdit your search query using Basic or JQL.\n\nSelect Insert issues.\n\nMove a mighty amount of issues from a completed sprint\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nDidn't get through all the issues you'd planned to in a sprint (we're talking more than a thousand or so)?\n\nTake a moment to pause while they're dropped into a new sprint, a sprint that you've already created, or your backlog.\n\nColourful categories\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nProject admins can now assign colours to categories from the list view in Jira.\n\nManage custom fields for your project in context of the list view\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now create and manage custom fields in context of the list view.\n\nCertain types of work may require specific information for your team to get the job done. Jira now allows you to create and manage these additional fields in context of the list view to save you from navigating away from your work.\n\nThis will help your team with viewing the right, relevant information upfront when completing tasks.\n\nTo get started with the change, select the plus symbol at the top right of your list view to show or hide more fields, and manage your custom fields.\n\nTrack and triage incidents affecting your services in Jira\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re excited to roll out the new incidents feature in Jira Software Cloud.\n\nThis feature pulls in data from connected incident management, monitoring, and observability tools, so your development team can have a holistic view of incidents impacting services they are responsible for.\n\nOur first supported product is Jira Service Management, and we plan to add support for more incident management and observability tools soon.\n\nBy turning unexpected incidents into manageable, visible work, you can improve your team’s focus on quick resolution and internal review while building proactive work practices to prevent incidents from happening again.\n\nTo get started with the incidents feature:\n\nFor some customers who use Jira Service Management, the feature will be available and automatically appear under Operations in the list of features.\n\nTo turn it on manually:\n\nGo to Project settings > Features.\n\nToggle Incidents on.\n\nWe're gradually rolling out the incidents feature over the next few weeks to specific customers. If you don't see it yet, check back again soon.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nJira site admins can now finish setting up code and deployment tools by following a link from the issue view. If any site admin has installed a tool on your site, we'll show a link on the development panel so you can finish setting it up.\n\nIf a code tool has been installed but not configured, we'll show a link to Set up code tools.\n\nIf a deployment tool has been installed but not configured, we'll show a link to Set up deployment tools.\n\nTo get started:\n\nGo to your Jira project and open an issue.\n\nIn the development panel, select Set up code tools (or Set up deployment tools).\n\nIn the dropdown, select the tool you want to set up.\n\nFollow the steps to finish setting up your integration.\n\nFilter results dashboard gadget improvements\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThe gadget now displays issues in the same way as they appear in the issue navigator.

We’ll create a personalized Create issue form for each issue type and project.\n\nAll the fields you don’t use will be hidden in a More fields section, so you'll always be able to interact with them. The feature is continuously learning. If we notice you using a previously unused field, we’ll pull it out of the More fields section for the next time.\n\nWe’ll automatically turn on the feature to hide unused fields when creating issues, but you can manage it by heading to Personal settings and finding to the Jira labs section. From there, you can use the toggle to opt in and out of the feature.\n\nGet suggestions for child issues from AI\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nUse Atlassian Intelligence to generate a list of suggested child issues, based on the details of the parent issue.\n\nWhen you accept a suggestion, a new child issue will be created and linked to the parent issue.\n\nTo see a list of AI-generated suggestions:\n\nOpen the parent issue.\n\nSelect Add a child issue under the issue summary. If you are in a company-managed project and want to create a subtask, select Create subtask.\n\nSelect Suggest issues.\n\nWe’ll then create a list of suggested child issues which you can accept, edit, or decline.\n\nTemplate bundles in the project create page\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nEffortlessly create between 2 to 6 projects at once, with bundles. We're helping streamline your project creation process and minimizing the need for repetitive manual tasks. Whether you're working in Jira or Jira Service Management, bundles guarantee a smooth project creation experience.\n\nChoose from two pre-set bundles: the Marketing or the IT team bundle.

Here are recommendations for how to structure your data for Assets schemas.\n\nSee also: How to build an effective ITAM schema structure.\n\nFor this reason, we're introducing a maximum cardinality limit of 20,000 per object type attribute for Assets. Read more about recommended data structures for Assets.\n\nExceeding these limits can cause performance and reliability issues, therefore each site cannot create further items once they reach the limit. You can find out how many objects your site currently contains using the feature usage screen. Read more about how to track your usage.\n\nCustomize your navigation\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nProject admins can control what the team sees in the project view navigation. Display what's most important to your team, and hide what's not. Any changes that are made to the navigation will be visible for everyone who has access to the project.\n\nProject admins can customize the following in their business project:\n\nSet the default view for the project\n\nHide a tab from the project view navigation\n\nAdd a tab back to the navigation if it has been removed\n\nReorder the tabs\n\nFind out more about customizing the navigation in your business project\n\nCompany-managed projects: Create, edit, and delete columns directly on the board\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIf you want to quickly add or update a column on your board, you don’t need to go far. You can now create, rename, move, set constraints for, and delete columns without leaving the board. You’ll still have the ability to do all of the above in your board’s settings page, but if you’ve only got time for a quick fix, we’ve now got you covered!\n\nIf you’re a project or board admin for the board you want to update, you can try the following changes:\n\nTo create a column, select the + icon to the right of all columns.\n\nTo rename a column, select its name to edit directly.\n\nTo move a column, select its top, then drag the column to its new position.\n\nTo set column constraints, right-click its name or hover to select more actions (•••) > Set column limit.\n\nTo delete a column, right-click its name or hover to select more actions (•••) > Delete.\n\nThe team field in Jira issues now shows the team icon\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nPreviously, selecting the team field in an issue would prompt a search displaying the singular \"Person\" icon. The correct \"Team\" icon now shows to indicate what should be selected for the field.\n\nDrag and drop to reparent issues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve made it easier to reparent issues in the timeline and list views.\n\nWe’re slowly rolling out this feature, so don’t worry if you can’t see this yet.\n\nIn the timeline and list views, you can now reparent a single issue by simply dragging and dropping it underneath a new parent issue.\n\nJira: Import from ClickUp\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nMoving your work from ClickUp to Jira just got easier. Using the ClickUp importer, you can directly import projects into Jira.\n\nSave the effort of manually moving data and ensure the project information is relevant and accurate.\n\nTo directly import your data using the ClickUp importer:\n\nFrom the navigation bar, select Projects > Create project.\n\nFrom the sidebar, go to More > select Import data.\n\nSelect Import to a new business project.\n\nIn the import from an app section, select ClickUp.\n\nView project work in a single list\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nView all your project's work in a single list that can be quickly scanned and sorted by field.

We're also moving the “Filter issues with warnings” toggle from inside the Warnings dropdown menu to the Filters dropdown menu, so you can see all the details there.\n\nImprove the clarity of issue descriptions with AI\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nUse Atlassian Intelligence to add clarity to your issue descriptions. Quickly improve your descriptions with clear structure and headings so they’re easier to read.\n\nTo get started, while you’re writing an issue description:\n\nType / in the issue description field, or select the Atlassian Intelligence button.\n\nType or select Add structure.\n\nUsing AI, we’ll generate a new, structured issue description for you to review. Look over the new description, and choose to replace your existing description or add the new one underneath.\n\nPrevent people from exporting content in specific spaces and projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nData security policies allow you to use rules to control how users, apps, and people outside the organization can interact with content such as Confluence pages and Jira issues.\n\nYou can now use the data export rule to prevent people exporting content from particularly sensitive Confluence spaces and Jira projects. Previously, this was only available for policies that covered entire workspaces or classification levels).\n\nThe data export rule requires Atlassian Guard Standard (formerly known as Atlassian Access).\n\nTo create a new data security policy or view existing policies:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security > Data security policies.\n\nEasily control the visibility of work suggestions in Jira\n\nWe're adding a \"Turn off work suggestions\" link to the Work suggestions panel footer to let you easily find the Work suggestions toggle under the View settings menu. When you turn the toggle off, you'll no longer get any suggestions, and the work suggestions panel won't open when you select your avatar on the Jira board.\n\nYou can always turn Work suggestions on at any time from the View settings menu to start getting suggestions again.\n\nRead more about Jira work suggestions\n\nProduct admin support for Jira imports\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAlong with organization admins, product admins can also use Jira’s new import experience to quickly and seamlessly import data into new business or software projects with just a few clicks.\n\nTo import data into Jira:\n\nSelect Projects from the navigation bar > Create project.\n\nFrom the sidebar, go to More > select Import data and follow the instructions.\n\nRead about the new import experience\n\nJira Service Management\n\nJira Service Desk is now Jira Service Management!

Note that you won’t be able to switch back to the old experience.\n\nUse the GitHub for Jira app to connect GitHub Enterprise, instead of DVCS\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nJira admins making a new GitHub connection for a new organisation now need to install the GitHub for Jira app. The app functions just like the DVCS Connector, but with better security features and improved performance.\n\nThis only applies to new GitHub connections in new organisations. Existing connections using DVCS are not affected.\n\nLearn more about the GitHub for Jira app.\n\nControl what you see in your products\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nProduct recommendations now have controls, so now you can dismiss them or learn more about why you’re seeing them. These controls are being added to the recommendations in the app switcher menu which means you'll have more control and receive better product recommendations.\n\nYou can select the three dots next to the recommendation to learn why we have recommended it or to dismiss it entirely.\n\nThe recommendation controls will first be released to both Free and Standard teams of up to 50 users. Note: Only admins will be able to add a new product by clicking on the recommendation.\n\nMake it easy and secure for customers to log in to your help center with single sign-on\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you connect an identity provider to your Jira Service Management site, you can authenticate your customers with SAML single sign-on (SSO).\n\nBefore you begin\n\nYou must subscribe to Atlassian Access from your organization before you set up SAML single sign-on. Learn more about how to start with Atlassian Access\n\nTo set up SAML SSO for portal-only customers:\n\nGo to Settings > Products.\n\nUnder Jira Service Management, select Authentication.\n\nSelect Add identity provider.\n\nFollow the prompts to complete the setup.\n\nLearn more about SAML single sign-on for portal-only customers\n\nRetiring the possibility to manage the atlassian-addons-project-access role\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nFollowing up on our previous announcement, we’re planning to remove the possibility to manage the atlassian-addons-project-access role in two to six months. The exact date depends on the feedback we receive after this announcement.\n\nBy default, the role is assigned to all project permissions in permission schemes and all issue security levels in issue security schemes. As a result of this change, the possibility to manage that role’s permissions and issue security levels, both via the UI and the REST API, will be restricted.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the planned changes, please leave them under this public ticket.\n\nUse filters to search and display Jira issues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNow you can use filters to search for Jira issues and display them in a list, without leaving the Confluence page.\n\nThis improvement follows the release that allows you to search for issues using keywords or JQL, and flexibility to add, remove, and reorder fields.\n\nHow to display Jira issues in a list\n\nStart using filters to search for Jira issues:\n\nEdit a Jira description or comment.\n\nType /jira and select Jira issues.\n\nWith Basic selected, use the filters to search by Project, Type, Status, or Assignee.\n\nSelect Insert issues.\n\nThis will display your selected issues in a list format you can interact with.\n\nTo edit your list of Jira issues:\n\nSelect anywhere on the list.\n\nSelect the Edit button (left-most icon) from the menu that appears at the bottom of the table.\n\nEdit your search query using Basic or JQL.\n\nSelect Insert issues.\n\nFilter results dashboard gadget improvements\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThe gadget now displays issues in the same way as they appear in the issue navigator. When you configure the gadget, changing the displayed columns and their ordering also works the same as in the issue navigator.\n\nTake a look at the improvements by adding a new Filter results gadget to one of your Jira dashboards.\n\nHide unused fields when creating issues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThere can be a lot of fields to scroll through when you’re creating issues, and we know there are many fields that are simply unused.\n\nWe’re introducing a feature that only brings up the fields you actually use. We’ll create a personalized Create issue form for each issue type and project.\n\nAll the fields you don’t use will be hidden in a More fields section, so you'll always be able to interact with them. The feature is continuously learning. If we notice you using a previously unused field, we’ll pull it out of the More fields section for the next time.\n\nWe’ll automatically turn on the feature to hide unused fields when creating issues, but you can manage it by heading to Personal settings and finding to the Jira labs section. From there, you can use the toggle to opt in and out of the feature.\n\nChat in Slack: Emoji shortcuts are now powered by Jira automation\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nEmoji shortcuts, based off Halp’s legacy recipes, now use Jira automation’s powerful no-code engine. With this change, admins can manage all automation rules in one place and emoji reactions can be used to edit issues created by Assist in Slack — all allowing for a simpler configuration experience.\n\nIf your projects have custom emoji rules, you have until June 4, 2024, to set up similar ones in automation. After that date, the emoji shortcut feature in chat settings will no longer function.\n\nFind out more in our Community blog\n\nBefore you start setting up your new automation rules, keep in mind:\n\nThe ticket emoji shortcut used to create issues isn’t affected by this change, so you don’t need to set this up in automation.\n\nYou need to set up the eyes emoji shortcut, which assigns agents to issues. Tip: Use the template from the Emoji shortcuts tab in chat settings to quickly set up this automation.\n\nTo set up emoji rules in automation:\n\nFrom your project settings, select Automation.\n\nSelect Create rule.\n\nSelect Emoji reaction to Slack message as your trigger*.*\n\nSelect Turn on rule, name your rule, and then Turn on rule again to save.\n\nTo help test your new emoji rules, you can now turn off emoji shortcuts in chat without deleting them:\n\nSet up your emoji rule in automation.\n\nFrom the Emoji shortcuts tab in chat settings, find the rule to turn off.\n\nUse the toggle to turn off the rule.\n\nTest to your satisfaction.\n\nUse Atlassian Intelligence to define words in the issue description\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now use Atlassian Intelligence to define one or more words in the issue description. The definitions will be based on information found in connected Confluence spaces.\n\nTo use Atlassian Intelligence to define words:\n\nMake sure the description is in view mode, not edit mode\n\nHighlight words you need defined\n\nSelect Define\n\nDefinitions are only available in the description in view mode.\n\nMaximum cardinality limit on multi-value attributes in Assets\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAssets in Jira Service Management is a database and so requires a combination of good data modeling and a great deal of processing power to handle large amounts of data. Here are recommendations for how to structure your data for Assets schemas.\n\nSee also: How to build an effective ITAM schema structure.\n\nFor this reason, we're introducing a maximum cardinality limit of 20,000 per object type attribute for Assets. Read more about recommended data structures for Assets.\n\nExceeding these limits can cause performance and reliability issues, therefore each site cannot create further items once they reach the limit. You can find out how many objects your site currently contains using the feature usage screen. Read more about how to track your usage.\n\nData limits for object schemas in Assets\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAssets in Jira Service Management is a database and so requires a combination of good data modeling and a great deal of processing power to handle large amounts of data. Here are recommendations for how to structure your data for Assets schemas.\n\nSee also: How to build an effective ITAM schema structure.\n\nFor this reason, we have introduced limitations on how many objects, attributes, and attribute characters can be stored inside schemas within each individual Assets in Jira Service Management site. Read more about how much data you can store in Assets.\n\nExceeding these limits can cause performance and reliability issues, therefore each site cannot create further items once they reach the limit.

Read more about how to track your usage.\n\nBeta: Group alerts using Atlassian Intelligence\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThis Atlassian Intelligence feature is in beta. Read more about Atlassian Intelligence features.\n\nAtlassian Intelligence groups related alerts and offers insightful suggestions, helping your team manage alerts and resolve issues more effectively. Alert grouping lessens 'alert fatigue' for your on-call agents. Rather than dealing with each alert separately, they can view a collective summary of similar alerts through an alert group. Over time, Atlassian Intelligence learns to recognize new alerts, identify patterns, and improve grouping based on user feedback.\n\nTo use the alert grouping feature, make sure that your organization admin has activated Atlassian Intelligence from Atlassian Administration. To access the feature, go to the Alerts page and switch to AI view. This works only if you’re using the new alerting feature that's natively available in Jira Service Management.\n\nRead more about alert grouping\n\nThe team field in Jira issues now shows the team icon\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nPreviously, selecting the team field in an issue would prompt a search displaying the singular \"Person\" icon. The correct \"Team\" icon now shows to indicate what should be selected for the field.\n\nJira: Import from ClickUp\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nMoving your work from ClickUp to Jira just got easier.

This is particularly useful when you receive requests by email and end up with a lot of issues with the Emailed request request type. By using the Atlassian Intelligence triage feature, you can easily update these issues to have more appropriate request types.\n\nTo update the request types of issues with Atlassian Intelligence:\n\nSelect issues in your queue.\n\nSelect Triage.\n\nReview the suggestions and select the issues you want to update.\n\nSelect Apply.\n\nInternal note visibility restrictions for Jira Service Management\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nSoon you’ll be able to restrict the visibility of internal notes based on your project roles and groups.\n\nSometimes, teams need to hold private discussions about customer requests, and in the case of particularly sensitive topics these discussions may need to be confidential between only a few team members (such as those in your HR or Legal teams).\n\nWith the ability to restrict the visibility of internal comments, you can now continue those confidential discussions on the issue itself, without having to transfer to email or use other tools to keep the information private.\n\nTo set the visibility for internal notes, navigate to an issue and open the issue view. Find the comment section, and start creating an internal note. Then, select the Comment visibility button. Select which group or project role you’d like to restrict this comment to. Now, save your comment.\n\nOnly the comment creator and users added to the selected group or project role will see this comment once it’s saved, meaning you can continue to work knowing your confidential request information will stay private to you and your team.\n\nFind out more about project roles in Jira Service Management, or learn how to create and manage your groups.\n\nCalendar view for new Jira Service Management projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re excited to launch a new view of issues in Jira Service Management: calendar view! Like the board or your queues, the calendar is another way to view and manage your work in the way that works best for you and your team.\n\nIt’s a great way for team members to plan, track, and prioritize, and for team leads to see potential roadblocks before they cause delays. Read more about using the calendar to view your issues.\n\nCreate a new project, then select Calendar in your project navigation to check it out. You can schedule issues in the calendar by adding and filling out the Start date and Due date fields on an issue. Once those fields are filled, the issues will appear on your calendar so that you can view your work across the coming month and beyond.\n\nAt the moment, the calendar is only available in new Jira Service Management projects, but it will become available for your existing projects soon, alongside new and improved calendar features to help you and your team do their best work.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've made some minor updates to the AI issue triage feature. Issues that can't be updated are now grouped together to allow for easier scanning and comprehension at a glance.\n\nAttach a form directly from the request type configuration page\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve made it even easier for admins to attach new forms to request types without needing to navigate to form settings.\n\nAfter selecting Attach form when in request type, you can now choose to either create a new form from the form template library, or search and select an existing form.\n\nSelect Create from template to browse over 200 form templates with pre-built conditional sections and rich formatting to help get you started sooner. Or Select existing to search all forms across your entire project.\n\nRead more about adding forms to request types\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you move or bulk move issues to different projects or issue types (or migrate an issue type out of a project), you can now select the new request type during the move. We're excited to release this much-requested update to make issue migration simpler in Jira Service Management.\n\nRestrict request types in both company and team-managed service projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou may have request types in your service project that only specific people should be able to raise. Now you can control who can and can't raise these requests in Jira Service Management in both company and team-managed service projects!\n\nGive access to specific people and groups, and automatically restrict access to all others. If someone doesn’t have access to a request type, they won’t be able to raise that request as it won’t show up as an available option to them - even via search.\n\nRead more about restricting request types\n\nJira Product Discovery\n\nUse the GitHub for Jira app to connect GitHub Enterprise, instead of DVCS\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nJira admins making a new GitHub connection for a new organisation now need to install the GitHub for Jira app. The app functions just like the DVCS Connector, but with better security features and improved performance.\n\nThis only applies to new GitHub connections in new organisations. Existing connections using DVCS are not affected.\n\nLearn more about the GitHub for Jira app.\n\nNew granularity level for the timeline\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've increased the granularity displayed in the timeline to improve the overall experience.\n\nWhether you have chosen quarters or months for your timeline, you can now resize cards between months and half months.\n\nNew summary layout in your timeline\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIn your timeline, you can now change the card layout to a summarized one.

Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security > Data security policies.\n\nIntroducing text highlighting\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the addition of text highlighting to our editor, a highly requested feature that enhances your content creation and collaboration experience. This new functionality allows you to easily highlight text, making important information stand out.\n\nThe ability to highlight text is easily accessed from the main editing toolbar, located right beside the text color option. Six highlight colors are available: grey, teal, lime, orange, magenta, and purple.\n\nHighlighting can only be done by individuals with editing privileges for a page, unlike comments.\n\nPremium and Enterprise: Customize a dynamic info hub for your entire company with Company Hub\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nCompany Hub allows you to customize a beautiful and dynamic company-wide information central within Confluence, where employees can go for up-to-date announcements, news, key resources, and more.\n\nProduct admins can add a custom name and color scheme along with images, visual cards, links, and more to instantly craft a hub that looks and feels like your company's go-to destination.\n\nThis feature is currently in beta and rolling out gradually to our Premium and Enterprise customers.\n\nEmbed your Jira dashboards in Confluence\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou will now be able to copy a link from a Jira dashboard and paste it into Confluence as a smart link embed. This makes it easier to share your Jira data with other Confluence users.\n\nProfile cards show in edit mode\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nSelecting an @mention while editing will now show the person's profile card.\n\nSearch directly from the content tree\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNow you can filter items in the content tree by title, making it faster and easier to find what you're looking for.\n\nJust select the magnifying glass below the Content header and start entering a keyword from the item's title.\n\nEffortless content arrangement with drag-and-drop\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThis update introduces new drag-and-drop functionality for top-level elements in the Confluence editor, making it easier than ever to arrange your content. This feature enhances the user experience by allowing smooth content movement, reducing the need for cut-and-paste actions, and providing a more intuitive and modern editing experience.\n\nWhat's new:\n\nDrag and drop for top-level elements: A new drag handle makes it easy to rearrange any top-level element on your page.\n\nInstant selection: Select any element with a single action on the drag handle for fast and convenient movement.\n\nAuto-scroll functionality: Move content above or below the fold with automatic scrolling, ensuring smooth navigation while rearranging elements.\n\nFixed column widths for tables\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re pleased to introduce a new feature that enhances your control over your tables. You can now set column widths to fixed, ensuring that your table layout remains consistent even on narrow screens. This option is available in Table options in the table toolbar and is unchecked by default, allowing tables to scale as they always have. For those who prefer their tables to respond dynamically to screen sizes, we’ve increased the maximum scaling to give your tables even more flexibility.\n\nHow to use:\n\nInsert or select a table on your page.\n\nSelect the Table options icon in the table toolbar.\n\nSelect the Fixed column widths option to prevent your table columns from scaling down on narrow screens.\n\nThis update allows you to maintain the integrity of your table layouts across different screen sizes, providing a more consistent viewing experience.\n\nAutomation: Project created trigger\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nOne for the Confluence automation fans! You can now trigger Confluence automation rules when a Jira project is created.\n\nFor example, you could create a rule where every time a Jira project is created, Confluence creates a corresponding space and pages.\n\nTo give this a try:\n\nNavigate to Confluence automation\n\nFor space automation, go to Space settings > Automation\n\nFor global automation, go to Confluence administration > Automation\n\nWhen creating or modifying a rule, select Project created in Jira as the trigger.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now transfer ownership of your whiteboard, database, or Smart Link in the content tree to another user. Space and product admins can also make this change when needed.\n\nThis functionality was previously only available for pages, and ensures that the right person is always associated with the content.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now comment directly on inline elements such as emojis, statuses, mentions, dates, and inline cards (Smart links). Users can now leave comments on these specific elements, streamlining the commenting process and making it more intuitive and efficient for providing feedback and collaborating on documents.\n\nSmall change to the Automation audit log - we've updated the look and feel of the date picker to make it easier to use.\n\nTo check it out:\n\nNavigate to automation:\n\nFor Confluence automation, go to Confluence settings > Automation\n\nFor Jira automation, go to Jira settings > System > Global automation\n\nSelect Audit log.\n\nSelect Status and choose which statuses you want to filter by.\n\nBitbucket\n\nCache key support for self-hosted runners\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nSince releasing cache key support for builds on the Atlassian infrastructure earlier this year, we have been actively working to add cache key support for our customers who are using runners.

You can use natural language to tell AI how you want to transform your data, and AI will generate the SQLite expression for you.\n\nTo try it out:\n\nAdd a Formula column or Apply formula step.\n\nSelect Custom from the formula options.\n\nSelect AI.\n\nUse natural language to describe how you want to transform your data.\n\nSelect Submit.\n\nPowered by Confluence and Scroll Viewport.",
      "# [hyperlink in jira automation by community.atlassian.com, user-id on 2022-07-08](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/hyperlink-in-jira-automation/qaq-p/2074366)\nHi There, I'm trying to use jira automation to automatically input a link in a JSM issue when certain conditions are met. This in my case is placing a reference document on a related ticket. Right now the link is viewable and is clickable, but it shows the full URL for a confluence page which is looooong and I would like this to look similar to what you can do with an HREF tag in HTML. Is there a way to do this using jira automation?\n\n<a href=\"url\">link text</a>",

For example, inviting teammates, using a template, etc.\n\nThat means it’s easier to know what to do first in Jira Product Discovery so that you’re getting the most out of it.\n\nThe recommendations will show up in the ‘Your work’ part of Jira, and everyone with either a Free, Standard, or Premium plan will see them. You can dismiss them anytime so they stop showing up.\n\nStreamlining general and blank project templates in Jira Service Management\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re simplifying our Jira Service Management project templates and no longer splitting out our general and blank templates by IT and business team types.

And if you ever want to see how many more than 1000 that is, then simply select the 1000+ and it'll update to show the full object count. Simple huh? Happy Assets-ing!\n\nChanges to Jira Import Wizard\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nTo begin our move to a faster, improved import experience, we’re updating the Jira Import Wizard homepage.

This provides more granular control about email notifications and reduces clutter for users who are only interested in issue transitions.\n\nTo enable email notifications to users when an issue is transitioned:\n\nFrom your project’s sidebar, select Project settings and then Notifications.\n\nSelect Add notification.\n\nUsing the dropdown, search for and select the issue event An issue is updated by a workflow transition (generic event).\n\nSelect the users and roles that will receive this notification.\n\nSelect Add.\n\nMore about customizing notifications in team-managed projects\n\nQuickly view images directly from your board issue cards\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nBy adding an image attachment to an issue, you can show or hide images directly from your board in a company-managed software project.\n\nTo add or change an issue’s cover image:\n\nNavigate to your board view.\n\nHover over an issue.\n\nSelect ••• (more) on the issue.\n\nSelect Edit cover image and choose from the options.\n\nForms now support cascading fields\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThere may be times when you want to surface only specific values to customers that are dependent on another choice they've made. These could be on forms that need to capture a customer’s address, for example. Instead of seeing all possible cities or states, you can make it easier for customers by letting them narrow down their options by selecting a country first.\n\nThis is possible with cascading fields. This new field type lets you create conditional fields with two lists of values: a parent list of values and a child list of values that are dependent on what is selected in the parent list.\n\nRead more about using forms\n\nNew Jira instances are now domain-enabled\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNew Jira instances will be automatically domain-enabled from now on, meaning anyone with your organization's email domain (the one you used to sign up) will have access to projects that you send them links to. It'll save you time – you won't need to grant them access, after you've invited them. (Excludes existing Jira instances.) Find out how to disable this feature in your new Jira instance.\n\nMore control over your board and backlog view\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe're offering more customization options when viewing the board and backlog.

This sentence disappears after your first 15 days of having Confluence.\n\nThis sentence has been updated. It will now read: Confluence. Document collaboration.\n\nAdd and delete transition rules in the new workflow editor\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAs we continue to improve workflows in Jira, we're working to add important features from the old workflow designer to the new workflow editor.

Once the cursor appears, you can edit the summary straight from the cell.\n\nView the hierarchy of issues in the timeline\n\nWe are releasing hierarchy support in the timeline view, where you can now view the relationship between your issues.\n\nTo view the full hierarchy in the timeline view, you can:\n\nNavigate to the timeline view in your business project\n\nSelect the More button at the top-right of the timeline view\n\nSelect Expand all items to view the hierarchy and relationship between issues. You can also collapse the issue hierarchy by selecting Collapse all items.\n\nRemoval of SEN from UPM Manage apps\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThe SEN field has now been removed from the Manage apps section of UPM. To identify an entitlement, you'll have to use the new cloud identifier, which is the Entitlement number.\n\nAutomation: Changes to 'Send Microsoft Teams message' action\n\nIn response to changes announced by Microsoft, we've shipped some updates to how the Send Microsoft Teams message action works.\n\nThe action now uses Workflows in Microsoft Teams to send messages from your automation rules.\n\nFor existing rules that already use the Send Microsoft Teams message action, you'll need to update the Webhook URL field. Here's how:\n\nGo to your channel in Teams and select …›\n\nWorkflows > Post to a channel when a webhook request is received.\n\nPaste the webhook URL into the ‘Send Microsoft Teams message’ action.\n\nSelect Update.\n\nWe recommend updating your rules by December 31, 2024.\n\nReducing ‘issue’ terminology in Jira\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re reducing the use of 'issue' terminology in an effort to simplify our language and better suit all team types.\n\nSimplify your marketing work intake with a form template\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWith a ready-to-go template, you can quickly request information from your stakeholders for marketing campaigns, content creation, event planning, social media posts, graphic design, or email marketing.\n\nTo get started:\n\nSelect Forms from the project view navigation.\n\nSelect Templates to open the templates drawer on the right.\n\nLearn more about creating forms\n\nAdmins can now delete previous project keys\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re giving admins the ability to delete previous project keys so they can be used for new projects.\n\nWhenever you change your project key, we automatically save your previous project keys.

The panel will now have an additional filter called Custom fields, which will contain up to 50 custom issue fields from the current instance you have access to. You can search and copy these custom fields to use them while creating rules in the rulebuilder. Custom fields can be filtered by either the smart value or the untranslated name using text input. We will also display if these fields can be used globally or are bound to a single project.\n\nTo start using this feature:\n\nOpen the automation rulebuilder.\n\nSelect a trigger for your rule.\n\nAdd an action that has smart value text fields, such as the Log action, Send web request or Create issue action.\n\nSelect the {} button to open the smart values panel.\n\nSelect the Custom fields tab to browse available custom issue fields.\n\nYou can now copy and use these custom fields in your rule.\n\nLearn more about using smart values in Atlassian automation\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdd and view Smart Links in URL and short text fields.

This feature was intended to make it easy to view your Jira Service Management requests from your Jira Software project, but we’ve found its performance wasn’t quite up to scratch.\n\nIf you’ve participated in the Requests beta in your software project and have been using it, all your request data will still be available in Jira Service Management. You can still work with requests from your software request by implementing one of the alternative options we’ve provided on Atlassian Community.\n\nEdit your help center's home page layout and add rich content to it\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWith this release, admins will have more control over their help center's home page, allowing them to tailor it to fit the needs of their audiences.

With the touch of a button, you can add a pre-populated comment to an issue and instantly save it, or use it as a starting point to type more information before saving.\n\nWhat’s the benefit of smart replies? Jira’s real superpower lies in collaboration. By encouraging your team to respond to work and comment on issues faster and more often, smart replies can help your team embrace Jira’s unlimited power of accelerated collaboration.\n\nIf you don’t want to use a smart reply, simply start typing in the issue’s comment box, and the smart replies will disappear.\n\nTo disable the feature, go to Settings > Personal Jira settings > General, and disable the smart replies toggle within the Jira labs section. (This only affects you.) Or to remove the feature entirely (affecting everyone in your Jira instance), contact Atlassian Support.\n\nRead more about smart replies.\n\nSearch for boards by project\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nFilter boards by project to quickly find the exact board you’re looking for.

However, the parent field previously ignored the edit issue screen. If the parent field was not on the edit issue screen, it was still considered editable. We are changing this behaviour to make the parent field behave like other fields, and ensure it is not editable if the parent field is not on the edit issue screen.\n\nTo avoid problems arising from the change in behaviour, the parent field will be added to all existing screens configured for the edit issue operation.\n\nWhen this change has rolled out, Jira administrators can remove the parent field from the edit issue operation screen if they wish to restrict the editing of the parent field.\n\nCollect higher quality information with business forms\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nGather better quality information with new functionality for business forms.\n\nChoose from more fields including parent, category and people.

All previously selected filters will be automatically de-selected.\n\nYour audit log will now have no filters applied to it.\n\nLearn more about using the audit log in Jira and Confluence automation\n\nJira\n\nCustom Compass component types support in Jira\n\nROLLING OUT NEW THIS WEEK\n\nWe're introducing a new capability in Compass that allows product admins to create component types based on the terminology their teams use to categorize them. Custom type names will be supported in Jira, but will use the OTHER icon.\n\nIn Compass, product admins can create up to 14 component types, but anyone on their Compass plan can use them. This customization helps software teams better group components at a high level across their distributed architecture.\n\nGet new work suggestions for pull requests needing attention\n\nROLLING OUT NEW THIS WEEK\n\nWork suggestions in Jira will now show you new suggestions for pull requests that need your attention.\n\nYou’ll see suggestions when your pull requests are ready to merge (Bitbucket Cloud only), have been inactive for more than five days, or when someone adds you as a reviewer on their draft pull requests (GitHub only).\n\nWhen you select your avatar on the board, these suggestions, if available, will automatically appear in the work suggestions panel.\n\nThe new suggestions will be available in scrum and kanban projects in Jira.\n\nRead more about work suggestions in Jira\n\nPlans in Jira - Change the duration of the program board\n\nROLLING OUT NEW THIS WEEK\n\nWe're a few months into the Program board Open Beta, and we've gotten a lot of feedback about how to improve it. One of the most requested improvements was the ability to change the number of sprints shown on the board and the duration of them.\n\nGuess what we're releasing today?\n\nThat's right: when you create a new Program board, you can now change:\n\nthe duration of each column to between one and four weeks\n\nthe total number of columns to show between four and 13\n\nUsing these, you can adjust the total duration of your board to be as little as seven weeks and as much as 16.\n\nHaven't met the Program board yet? Allow me to introduce you.\n\nAccessibility improvements in the project timeline\n\nROLLING OUT NEW THIS WEEK\n\nOver the next few weeks, we'll be shipping a few accessibility improvements when viewing the project timeline.

We’ll create a personalized Create issue form for each issue type and project.\n\nAll the fields you don’t use will be hidden in a More fields section, so you'll always be able to interact with them. The feature is continuously learning. If we notice you using a previously unused field, we’ll pull it out of the More fields section for the next time.\n\nWe’ll automatically turn on the feature to hide unused fields when creating issues, but you can manage it by heading to Personal settings and finding to the Jira labs section. From there, you can use the toggle to opt in and out of the feature.\n\nTemplate bundles in the project create page\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nEffortlessly create between 2 to 6 projects at once, with bundles. We're helping streamline your project creation process and minimizing the need for repetitive manual tasks.

It now allows you to clean out old projects as well as issues, project role permissions, and custom fields.\n\nWhen looking at projects that can be deleted, you can select projects to clear out from your site based on those that:\n\nhave no issues or\n\nhaven't been updated in a certain amount of time\n\nFrom here, you can choose to either archive them or send them to the trash.\n\nMove a sprint from one board to another\n\nYou can now use the field \"originBoardId\" to move a sprint from one board to another.\n\nTo transfer a sprint from one board to another, send a request by using the field \"originBoardId\". For more details, see the documentation on the REST APIs related to sprints.\n\nBoard and backlog insights now available to all Jira users\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve updated the Insights feature on the board and the backlog for company-managed projects in Jira. Now, all users can view insights, regardless of what permissions they have.\n\nWith real-time data, you can use insights to review your team’s progress, identify issues that need attention, and plan your sprints with confidence. Adjust, maintain, or refocus your priorities to keep the team on track.\n\nRead more about insights in Jira Cloud\n\nTo view your insights:\n\nFind your team's Jira software project.\n\nSelect the board or backlog.\n\nSelect Insights.\n\nBulk duplicate and delete components in the automation rulebuilder\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe're introducing a new feature that allows you to select multiple components at once in the automation rulebuilder and either duplicate or delete them. This change affects both Jira and Confluence, and should help to improve efficiency in the rulebuilder, as you'll no longer need to select each component one at a time to edit them.\n\nTo select and edit multiple components at once:\n\nHold down the Ctrl / Command key and click the left button on your mouse or touchpad.\n\nSelect the number of components you want to duplicate or delete.\n\nOnce the components are selected, you can use the new menu to duplicate or delete them.\n\nJira Plans: Change plan owner\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now change who is listed as the owner of a plan in Jira, so you'll always know who's in the driver's seat.\n\nCompany-managed velocity reports now load asynchronously\n\nWe've updated the way the velocity report loads in company-managed projects to improve its stability and prevent timeout issues. As part of this change, the \"Prioritize page load time\" toggle has been removed from the Velocity Report page.\n\nRead our community post about reliability enhancements on the velocity report page.\n\nConnect issues to goals in your Jira list\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nUse the Goals field in Jira to connect your team’s work to higher-level business objectives. Goals help your team understand how their efforts drive impact and help leaders manage dependencies and mitigate risk. All issue types can now be linked to a goal in software projects, business projects, and plans.\n\nEnable the Goals field to show as a column in your list. Once enabled, you can create goals, link issues to the goals they contribute to, and filter issues in your list based on goals.\n\nHow to link and unlink goals to issues\n\nEditor AI: Improved command palette\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've redesigned the command palette for AI options in the editor. The palette height has been extended, and less-frequently used prompts have been organised into sub-menus.\n\nPalette organization: The editor AI palette options like Translate and Change are now grouped into submenus for better organization.\n\nBack button: The palette now supports a Back action, allowing you to navigate back within the command palette.\n\nLayout update: The general AI response-layout has been updated for a cleaner look.\n\nKeyboard shortcut for chat: A quick shortcut for the Open in chat action has been added for faster access.\n\nNew workflow editor: Trigger a webhook rule\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nConnect Jira to other tools with the Trigger a webhook rule. By adding it to a transition in the new workflow editor, you’ll be able to send a webhook and notify an external system when an issue moves through that transition. This allows your other tools to act on this updated information accordingly.\n\nImproved performance and reliability for CSV exports\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIf you need to export your Jira issues, you’ll notice a faster and smoother experience due to the following improvements:\n\nSpeed and reliability — the export process is faster and can handle a large number of fields and extensive data sets\n\nTracking and control — you can monitor the progress of your export, and cancel if needed\n\nTo try it out, go to the Issues page in your project. Select Export, then select a CSV export option.\n\nNote that only one CSV export can be processed at a time.\n\nNew validation for fields in the workflow editor\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've revamped how field validation works when building workflows for company-managed projects, as well as introduced this feature to team-managed projects.\n\nWhen building a project workflow, validators let you specify criteria for when an issue can move through a particular transition.\n\nGo to Project settings > Workflow to get started, then follow these instructions to add validators depending on your project type:\n\nAdd or edit rule to a team-managed project\n\nAdd or edit a rule for a company-managed project\n\nIf you're already using validators for a company-managed project, don't worry, your existing rules still work and are fully compatible with the new experience.\n\nSpeed up your next Jira import with configuration files\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen importing multiple projects using CSV files, a configuration file can help you save your preferences, such as project settings, Jira fields, and user information, and use it for future imports. In the new import experience, select Download a configuration file at the end of your next Jira project import. Upload it with a CSV file in another import to bring in the same preferences without the hassle of selecting the same fields once again.\n\nTo use a configuration file during an import:\n\nFrom the navigation bar, select Projects > Create project > Import data.\n\nSelect the app from which you’d like to import your data from. If you can’t find your app in the list, select CSV to use any CSV file to import your data.\n\nIf you select Asana, ClickUp, monday, or Trello, you can directly import data without a CSV file.\n\nSelect Upload a configuration file (optional) and upload the configuration file you downloaded from a previous import.\n\nSelect Next and continue with the import.\n\nRead about configuration files\n\nPriorities page refreshed and more accessible\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdding priorities to work communicates urgency and brings focus to the most important tasks.\n\nUse the refreshed Priorities page to add, delete, and re-order priorities. You can also add priority names and colors and upload icons.\n\nTo see the list of priorities on your Jira site, go to Jira settings, then issues, then priorities.\n\nCreate issues directly in your calendar\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWith just a few clicks, you can create and schedule issues directly in your calendar.\n\nPrior to this change, issues were scheduled by adding start and due dates or using the unscheduled work panel. Issues can still be scheduled in those ways, but this is now the quickest way to do it.\n\nHow to create, edit, and delete issues in your calendar\n\nTo create an issue in your calendar:\n\nSelect an empty space on the date you’d like the issue scheduled. The date selected will be the issue’s due date.\n\nEnter a summary, select the issue type, then select Create.\n\nTo create an issue that spans multiple days:\n\nClick and drag to select multiple days. The first and last dates selected will be the issue’s start and due date.\n\nEnter a summary, select the issue type, then select Create.\n\nInsight settings are being removed from software projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAs part of our ongoing effort to simplify project settings for admins, we're removing the option to configure insight settings in Jira software projects. Insights will continue to show as normal, but board admins and project admins won't be able to enable or disable specific insights, and any insights that were previously disabled will now be enabled. This means that all insights available in a project will be visible to any user who selects Insights from the board or backlog.\n\nTo send us feedback about this change:\n\nIn your Jira software project, select Board or Backlog.\n\nSelect Insights.\n\nScroll to the bottom of your Insights and select Give feedback.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've fixed a bug where attachments in private comments were visible to all users. If your issue cards were configured to show images, these would show on the board and backlog too.\n\nThis is no longer the case — if you can see attachments in private comments or images on the board and backlog, rest assured that you're the intended audience.\n\nConnect issues to higher-level goals in the issue view\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now align your team’s work to higher-level goals directly in the issue view. Goals help your team understand how their efforts drive impact and help leaders manage dependencies and mitigate risk.\n\nIf you linked an issue to a goal before this change, the Goals field will be automatically enabled in the issue view. This change will replace the previous experience of connecting goals in the issue view.\n\nIf you haven’t linked an issue to a goal before, you’ll need to enable the Goals field for an issue type.\n\nTo enable the Goals field:\n\nOpen an issue of the type you'd like to add the Goals field to.\n\nSelect Configure at the bottom-right of the issue (near the created and updated dates).\n\nIn the Fields panel, search for Goals.\n\nDrag the Goals field to the Context fields section.\n\nSelect Save changes to finalize.\n\nJira Service Management\n\nJira Service Desk is now Jira Service Management! We’re in the process of rolling out some exciting new features for all users. Learn more about these new features.\n\nUse Atlassian Intelligence to draft a reply\n\nROLLING OUT NEW THIS WEEK\n\nYou can now use Atlassian Intelligence to draft replies (beta) for your customers.

Note that you won’t be able to switch back to the old experience.\n\nUse the GitHub for Jira app to connect GitHub Enterprise, instead of DVCS\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nJira admins making a new GitHub connection for a new organisation now need to install the GitHub for Jira app. The app functions just like the DVCS Connector, but with better security features and improved performance.\n\nThis only applies to new GitHub connections in new organisations. Existing connections using DVCS are not affected.\n\nLearn more about the GitHub for Jira app.\n\nControl what you see in your products\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nProduct recommendations now have controls, so now you can dismiss them or learn more about why you’re seeing them. These controls are being added to the recommendations in the app switcher menu which means you'll have more control and receive better product recommendations.\n\nYou can select the three dots next to the recommendation to learn why we have recommended it or to dismiss it entirely.\n\nThe recommendation controls will first be released to both Free and Standard teams of up to 50 users. Note: Only admins will be able to add a new product by clicking on the recommendation.\n\nMake it easy and secure for customers to log in to your help center with single sign-on\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you connect an identity provider to your Jira Service Management site, you can authenticate your customers with SAML single sign-on (SSO).\n\nBefore you begin\n\nYou must subscribe to Atlassian Access from your organization before you set up SAML single sign-on. Learn more about how to start with Atlassian Access\n\nTo set up SAML SSO for portal-only customers:\n\nGo to Settings > Products.\n\nUnder Jira Service Management, select Authentication.\n\nSelect Add identity provider.\n\nFollow the prompts to complete the setup.\n\nLearn more about SAML single sign-on for portal-only customers\n\nAttribute limits for object types in Assets\n\nAs part of ongoing work to improve the performance and reliability of Assets, we're introducing a limit of 200 attributes per object type in Assets for Jira Service Management. How much data you can store in Assets.\n\nHide unused fields when creating issues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThere can be a lot of fields to scroll through when you’re creating issues, and we know there are many fields that are simply unused.\n\nWe’re introducing a feature that only brings up the fields you actually use. We’ll create a personalized Create issue form for each issue type and project.\n\nAll the fields you don’t use will be hidden in a More fields section, so you'll always be able to interact with them. The feature is continuously learning. If we notice you using a previously unused field, we’ll pull it out of the More fields section for the next time.\n\nWe’ll automatically turn on the feature to hide unused fields when creating issues, but you can manage it by heading to Personal settings and finding to the Jira labs section. From there, you can use the toggle to opt in and out of the feature.\n\nChat in Slack: Emoji shortcuts are now powered by Jira automation\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nEmoji shortcuts, based off Halp’s legacy recipes, now use Jira automation’s powerful no-code engine. With this change, admins can manage all automation rules in one place and emoji reactions can be used to edit issues created by Assist in Slack — all allowing for a simpler configuration experience.\n\nIf your projects have custom emoji rules, you have until June 4, 2024, to set up similar ones in automation. After that date, the emoji shortcut feature in chat settings will no longer function.\n\nFind out more in our Community blog\n\nBefore you start setting up your new automation rules, keep in mind:\n\nThe ticket emoji shortcut used to create issues isn’t affected by this change, so you don’t need to set this up in automation.\n\nYou need to set up the eyes emoji shortcut, which assigns agents to issues. Tip: Use the template from the Emoji shortcuts tab in chat settings to quickly set up this automation.\n\nTo set up emoji rules in automation:\n\nFrom your project settings, select Automation.\n\nSelect Create rule.\n\nSelect Emoji reaction to Slack message as your trigger*.*\n\nSelect Turn on rule, name your rule, and then Turn on rule again to save.\n\nTo help test your new emoji rules, you can now turn off emoji shortcuts in chat without deleting them:\n\nSet up your emoji rule in automation.\n\nFrom the Emoji shortcuts tab in chat settings, find the rule to turn off.\n\nUse the toggle to turn off the rule.\n\nTest to your satisfaction.\n\nUse Atlassian Intelligence to define words in the issue description\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now use Atlassian Intelligence to define one or more words in the issue description. The definitions will be based on information found in connected Confluence spaces.\n\nTo use Atlassian Intelligence to define words:\n\nMake sure the description is in view mode, not edit mode\n\nHighlight words you need defined\n\nSelect Define\n\nDefinitions are only available in the description in view mode.\n\nText area limits for attributes in Assets\n\nAs part of ongoing work to improve the performance and reliability of Assets, we're introducing a limit of 10,000 characters to text areas for attributes in Assets. Read more about recommended data structures for Assets.\n\nData limits for object schemas in Assets\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAssets in Jira Service Management is a database and so requires a combination of good data modeling and a great deal of processing power to handle large amounts of data. Here are recommendations for how to structure your data for Assets schemas.\n\nSee also: How to build an effective ITAM schema structure.\n\nFor this reason, we have introduced limitations on how many objects, attributes, and attribute characters can be stored inside schemas within each individual Assets in Jira Service Management site. Read more about how much data you can store in Assets.\n\nExceeding these limits can cause performance and reliability issues, therefore each site cannot create further items once they reach the limit. You can find out how many objects your site currently contains using the feature usage screen. Read more about how to track your usage.\n\nImproved editing experience for Queues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've made improvements to the \"Basic\" editing experience for Queues in Jira Service Management.

Or Select existing to search all forms across your entire project.\n\nRead more about adding forms to request types\n\nEarlier this year, we released a new feature powered by Atlassian Intelligence that updates the request types for multiple issues at once.\n\nThis is particularly useful when you receive requests by email and end up with a lot of issues with the Emailed request request type. Using the Atlassian Intelligence triage feature, you can easily update these issues to have more appropriate request types.\n\nNow, if the suggestions don't match what you need for your issues, you can select your own request type from the list and continue the bulk update with your own selected request type.\n\nRequest types that the issue can't be moved to can't be selected. For example, request types with required fields that can't be filled by Atlassian Intelligence won't be available in the list.\n\nTo update the request types of issues with Atlassian Intelligence:\n\nSelect issues in your queue.\n\nSelect Triage.\n\nReview the suggestions and update request types if necessary.\n\nSelect the issues you want to update.\n\nSelect Apply.\n\nAddress high-priority work first with the issues for attention insight\n\nFind and address high-priority work on your board with the issues for attention insight for Jira Service Management.

Blocked issues are blocked by their dependencies. Stuck issues have stayed in the same status for too long. What counts as ‘too long’ is calculated based on the amount of time other issues usually stay in the status. If the issue has spent longer in the status than 85% of other issues, it's considered stuck. Read more about issues for attention\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThe calendar view of issues is a great way for team members to plan, track, and prioritize their work and for team leads to see potential roadblocks before they cause delays. Read more about the calendar view.\n\nBy default, issues appear on the calendar based on the data in Jira’s default date fields - start date and Due date - but you can now select any date fields from your project, giving you more flexibility to work in the way that's best for your team.\n\nFor example, you might want to use Planned start and Planned end date fields to track when you plan to work on an issue, or your team might prefer issues to be shown on the calendar by the Actual Start and Actual End dates.\n\nTo change your date fields:\n\nFrom your service project, go to Calendar.\n\nSelect Configure calendar from the more menu (•••).\n\nGo to Date fields.\n\nSelect a field for the Start date and a field for the End date from the dropdowns. We recommend using two date-time fields, rather than date-only fields.\n\nSelect Save.\n\nNot seeing your issues on the calendar?

The exact date depends on the feedback we receive after this announcement.\n\nBy default, the role is assigned to all project permissions in permission schemes and all issue security levels in issue security schemes. As a result of this change, the possibility to manage that role’s permissions and issue security levels, both via the UI and the REST API, will be restricted.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the planned changes, please leave them under this public ticket.\n\nCreate custom domains for your Jira products\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe removed keyword restrictions when you create custom domains.

Another reason is that the apps may not store any data in the scope of the Marketplace partner's data residency policies.\n\nTo request a data residency move for your apps, you will have first to move your product. Learn more about how to move your product from one location to another\n\nOnce your product has been pinned to your selected location, you can move your eligible apps to the same location.

Helpful if you want to identify any spikes or dips in object creation at any given time.\n\nTemplate recommendations in your Projects directory have a new home\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you click on ‘Projects’ in your top navigation in Jira you land in your Projects directory. Previously, recommended templates were listed at the top of this directory.\n\nNow, the templates we recommend sit to the side. You can display and hide them as before; the main difference is that when you hover over any of the templates, you can see a preview of what that template looks like and how it works.\n\nWe've also changed the logic behind the recommendations so that they’re more specific and useful.\n\nCheck out your usage trends for the virtual agent\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nA few months ago we launched the feature usage screen for the virtual agent in Jira settings > Products > Feature usage. Now you can check your usage over the last 6 months using the chart feature - see when it spiked in the past to plan for it in the future!\n\nClassify your sensitive work\n\nHelp people recognize when they’re viewing or working on sensitive information by classifying your pages, blogs, issues, and requests.

Existing connections using DVCS are not affected.\n\nLearn more about the GitHub for Jira app.\n\nAdvanced Roadmaps - New navigation\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdvanced Roadmaps has a new look that makes it look and feel more like the rest of Jira Software.\n\nTo state it simply, the nav now lives on the left-hand side. This new layout opens Advanced Roadmaps up to a whole new world of designs and new features (whoops, not sure if I was supposed to say that 🤭).\n\nEven though this is rollout to all users, we'd still love to hear your thoughts about how it effects your work, or your ideas for improvements. Use the Give feedback button which is still located in the upper right of your screen.\n\nIf you opted in the Early Access Program from last month, you won't notice a change.

The exact date depends on the feedback we receive after this announcement.\n\nBy default, the role is assigned to all project permissions in permission schemes and all issue security levels in issue security schemes. As a result of this change, the possibility to manage that role’s permissions and issue security levels, both via the UI and the REST API, will be restricted.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the planned changes, please leave them under this public ticket.\n\nOrganize and track work against Compass software components\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now link issues to Compass components from any company-managed Jira Software project.\n\nThis helps your team organize and track work in Jira against elements of your software architecture cataloged in Compass – so you can understand the impact of that work; prioritize work more effectively; and find the information you need to get that work done faster.\n\nLearn more about Compass components\n\nSwitch to Compass components (project admins)\n\nIn your project sidebar, select Components.\n\nCheck that Compass components are turned on. Next to Create component, it should say Compass components. If it says Jira components, select it and switch to Compass components.\n\nJira components won't be deleted, and they'll still be visible on issues they were previously linked to. You can switch back to Jira components at any time.\n\nRead the full documentation\n\nLink issues to Compass components\n\nIf you don't have Compass yet:\n\nOn the Components page, select Get Compass free.

We’ll create a personalized Create issue form for each issue type and project.\n\nAll the fields you don’t use will be hidden in a More fields section, so you'll always be able to interact with them. The feature is continuously learning. If we notice you using a previously unused field, we’ll pull it out of the More fields section for the next time.\n\nWe’ll automatically turn on the feature to hide unused fields when creating issues, but you can manage it by heading to Personal settings and finding to the Jira labs section. From there, you can use the toggle to opt in and out of the feature.\n\nTemplate bundles in the project create page\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nEffortlessly create between 2 to 6 projects at once, with bundles.

Here are recommendations for how to structure your data for Assets schemas.\n\nSee also: How to build an effective ITAM schema structure.\n\nFor this reason, we're introducing a maximum cardinality limit of 20,000 per object type attribute for Assets. Read more about recommended data structures for Assets.\n\nExceeding these limits can cause performance and reliability issues, therefore each site cannot create further items once they reach the limit.

How to use email domains to automatically group customers into organizations\n\nHide unused fields when creating issues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThere can be a lot of fields to scroll through when you’re creating issues, and we know there are many fields that are simply unused.\n\nWe’re introducing a feature that only brings up the fields you actually use. We’ll create a personalized Create issue form for each issue type and project.\n\nAll the fields you don’t use will be hidden in a More fields section, so you'll always be able to interact with them. The feature is continuously learning. If we notice you using a previously unused field, we’ll pull it out of the More fields section for the next time.\n\nWe’ll automatically turn on the feature to hide unused fields when creating issues, but you can manage it by heading to Personal settings and finding to the Jira labs section. From there, you can use the toggle to opt in and out of the feature.\n\nChat in Slack: Emoji shortcuts are now powered by Jira automation\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nEmoji shortcuts, based off Halp’s legacy recipes, now use Jira automation’s powerful no-code engine. With this change, admins can manage all automation rules in one place and emoji reactions can be used to edit issues created by Assist in Slack — all allowing for a simpler configuration experience.\n\nIf your projects have custom emoji rules, you have until June 4, 2024, to set up similar ones in automation. After that date, the emoji shortcut feature in chat settings will no longer function.\n\nFind out more in our Community blog\n\nBefore you start setting up your new automation rules, keep in mind:\n\nThe ticket emoji shortcut used to create issues isn’t affected by this change, so you don’t need to set this up in automation.\n\nYou need to set up the eyes emoji shortcut, which assigns agents to issues. Tip: Use the template from the Emoji shortcuts tab in chat settings to quickly set up this automation.\n\nTo set up emoji rules in automation:\n\nFrom your project settings, select Automation.\n\nSelect Create rule.\n\nSelect Emoji reaction to Slack message as your trigger*.*\n\nSelect Turn on rule, name your rule, and then Turn on rule again to save.\n\nTo help test your new emoji rules, you can now turn off emoji shortcuts in chat without deleting them:\n\nSet up your emoji rule in automation.\n\nFrom the Emoji shortcuts tab in chat settings, find the rule to turn off.\n\nUse the toggle to turn off the rule.\n\nTest to your satisfaction.\n\nNew ways to manage email notifications from Jira\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've moved notification preferences out of your Personal settings page into its own Notifications space where we can continually develop ways for you to take control of your Jira notifications.\n\nWe've also replaced the old notification configurations with 10 notification preference options, so you have even more control of what notifications you actually want to receive.\n\nTo see the change:\n\nSelect your profile and settings icon, then select Notifications.\n\nUse Atlassian Intelligence to define words in the issue description\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now use Atlassian Intelligence to define one or more words in the issue description.

Now you have the ability to restrict request types - one of your top requested features!\n\nThere may be times when only specific people or groups should be able to raise certain requests. These could be requests reserved for managers, different departments in your company, or even those managing sensitive information such as HR or Legal teams.\n\nNow from any company-managed service project, you can restrict individual request types by giving access to specific people and groups, which then automatically restricts access to all others.\n\nRead more about restricting request types\n\nMaximum cardinality limit on multi-value attributes in Assets\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAssets in Jira Service Management is a database and so requires a combination of good data modeling and a great deal of processing power to handle large amounts of data. Here are recommendations for how to structure your data for Assets schemas.\n\nSee also: How to build an effective ITAM schema structure.\n\nFor this reason, we're introducing a maximum cardinality limit of 20,000 per object type attribute for Assets. Read more about recommended data structures for Assets.\n\nExceeding these limits can cause performance and reliability issues, therefore each site cannot create further items once they reach the limit. You can find out how many objects your site currently contains using the feature usage screen. Read more about how to track your usage.\n\nData limits for object schemas in Assets\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAssets in Jira Service Management is a database and so requires a combination of good data modeling and a great deal of processing power to handle large amounts of data. Here are recommendations for how to structure your data for Assets schemas.\n\nSee also: How to build an effective ITAM schema structure.\n\nFor this reason, we have introduced limitations on how many objects, attributes, and attribute characters can be stored inside schemas within each individual Assets in Jira Service Management site.

If you're a project admin, select Personal.\n\nResponse - Use this field to specify your signature.\n\nSelect the Use as Signature checkbox.\n\nSelect Save or Create to save your signature.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've introduced a new screen for editing details when creating a new blank request type in Jira Service Management.\n\nPreviously if you selected Create request type, then Create blank, you saw a modal and followed a two-step process to update the request type's name, description, icon, issue type, and portal group(s).\n\nWe've replaced this with a screen that allows you to easily review and update the same information in a single view, alongside a preview of the request form.\n\nTo see what's changed:\n\nFrom your service project, go to Project settings, then Request types.\n\nSelect Create request type, then Create blank.\n\nOn the left of the screen, you'll have the option to edit the name, description and icon for the new request type. You'll also be able to select an issue type, and select (or create) the portal group(s) where you want the request form to appear.\n\nOn the right of the screen, you'll see a preview of the form for the new request type. The blank request type will only contain a single Summary field as a placeholder so you can later customize the request form to meet your requirements.\n\nIf you choose to create a new request type by selecting Create request type, then Create from template, you'll use this same screen to review and update the request type's details.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've released a new feature powered by Atlassian Intelligence that updates the request types for multiple issues at once. This is particularly useful when you receive requests by email and end up with a lot of issues with the Emailed request request type.

Now when an author pushes new commits based on your pull request (PR) feedback, you’ll have the option to focus on just those new changes. We will be rolling this out to you intermittently beginning on June 18 with 100% of users having this feature on June 24. You can read more about what iterative review can do for you in our latest community post.\n\nCache key support for self-hosted runners\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nSince releasing cache key support for builds on the Atlassian infrastructure earlier this year, we have been actively working to add cache key support for our customers who are using runners. That being said, we are happy to announce that we now support runners using cache key to generate caches. Additional documentation on smart caches with cache keys can be found in the following section of our Caches help documentation: Caching with file-based cache keys.\n\nCompass\n\nUpgrade your Compass GitHub app to allow Compass to ingest pull request data\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAccept the updated permissions for your Compass GitHub app to authorize Compass to enrich the PR data/insights we show you in Compass.\n\nUpgrade your Compass GitHub app:\n\nIn GitHub, go to the organization settings for the organization that you've connected the Compass app to.\n\nSelect GitHub apps on the left sidebar.\n\nSelect the Review request link.\n\nEnter your GitHub password.\n\nSelect Accept new permissions.\n\nYou're now on the latest version of the Compass GitHub app.\n\nPowered by Confluence and Scroll Viewport.",

      "# [Latest updates](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/index/)\nWe release new versions of our Jira Data Center products frequently. As a Jira developer, it's important that you're aware of the changes. The following resources will help you keep track of what's happening.\n\nAtlassian Developer Community\n\nMajor changes that affect Jira Data Center developers are posted in the Atlassian Developer Community, like announcing EAP releases, adding new Jira modules, or the deprecation of API endpoints. You'll also find handy tips and articles related to Jira development.\n\nCheck out our Atlassian Developer Community\n\nEarly Access Program\n\nAn Early Access Program (EAP) release is a public development release leading up to the official release of a Jira version. Development releases are a snapshot of our work in progress, primarily focused on allowing Jira users to see the new features in advance and provide us with some useful feedback. EAP releases can include changes like:\n\nChanges to our APIs\n\nDatabase changes\n\nChanges to Jira bundled apps and libraries\n\nChanges in our supported platforms\n\nDownload the latest Jira EAP release\n\nEAP releases include more mature Beta Release and Release Candidate (RC) but they generally don't introduce new changes. Instead, they provide bug fixes and tweaks to features introduced in earlier EAP releases.\n\nLatest EAP\n\nThe EAP releases give you an opportunity to test and fix your apps in advance of an official release. Refer to the following table to prepare for the latest Jira version.\n\nJira Software 10.1 and Jira Service Management 10.1\n\nJira Software 9.x/Jira Service Management 5.x\n\nStarting from 9.13 and 5.13, new Jira releases support only Data Center licenses. If you try to upgrade to the Data Center-only release with your Server license, Jira will fail to start, and you'll need to downgrade to the version you were on before the upgrade or provide a valid Data Center license.\n\nIf you're using Atlassian Maven Plugin Suite (AMPS) to build your apps, remember to update its test data with a valid Data Center license to keep your apps compatible with Jira.\n\nEarlier EAP releases\n\nCheck out our earlier EAP releases for the supported Jira versions.\n\nJira platform version 10.x\n\nApplicationDateReferenceJira Software 10.0August 22, 2024Preparing for Jira 10\n\nChangelogJira Service Management 10.0\n\nJira platform version 9.x\n\nApplicationDateReferenceJira Software 9.17June 26, 2024ChangelogJira Service Management 5.17Jira Software 9.16May 6, 2024ChangelogJira Service Management 5.16Jira Software 9.15Mar 21, 2024ChangelogJira Service Management 5.15Jira Software 9.14Jan 31, 2024ChangelogJira Service Management 5.14Jira Software 9.13Nov 30, 2023ChangelogJira Service Management 5.13Jira Core/Software 9.12Oct 26, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.12Jira Service Management 5.12Jira Core/Software 9.11Aug 29, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.11Jira Service Management 5.11Jira Core/Software 9.10Jul 07, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.10Jira Service Management 5.10Jira Core/Software 9.9May 30, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.9Jira Service Management 5.9Jira Core/Software 9.8April 15, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.8Jira Service Management 5.8Jira Core/Software 9.7Mar 08, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.7Jira Service Management 5.7Jira Core/Software 9.6Jan 17, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.6Jira Service Management 5.6Jira Core/Software 9.5Dec 02, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.5Jira Service Management 5.5Jira Core/Software 9.4Oct 26, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.4Jira Service Management 5.4Jira Core/Software 9.3Sep 15, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.3Jira Service Management 5.3Jira Core/Software 9.2Aug 18, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.2Jira Service Management 5.2Jira Core/Software 9.1Jul 08, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.1Jira Service Management 5.1Jira Core/Software 9.0Jun 15, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.0Jira Service Management 5.0",
      "# [Loading... on 2018-01-27](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CLOUD-6999)\nHi everyone,\n\nMy name is Moinak Chatterjee and I’m a Senior Group Product Manager at Atlassian. We have a few important updates on custom domains.\n\nCustom domains for Jira and Confluence\n\nCustom domains are now generally available for Jira and will become generally available for Confluence starting in Q3. Custom domains for both Jira and Confluence will be available on Premium and Enterprise cloud plans. The rollout for Jira started today and will continue gradually over the next two weeks.\n\nCustom domains are an administrative capability that allow organizations to use their own domain name to host Atlassian products. For example, using go.jira.acme.com instead of acme.atlassian.net. Using a customer-branded URL instead of an Atlassian-branded URL helps make sites more discoverable, accessible, and uniquely yours, since they’re based on the organization’s domain rather than Atlassian’s. Custom domains join the family of advanced administrative capabilities that are the foundations of our Premium offering and are also included in Enterprise plans, alongside features like sandbox and release tracks.\n\nCustom domains for Jira Service Management help centers\n\nFor Jira Service Management (JSM) help centers, discoverability and branding are of the utmost importance so that your customers can get the help they need as quickly as possible. Custom domains for JSM help centers enable better customer service rather than better administration, which is why they will continue to be available on all paid cloud plans.\n\nGetting started with custom domains\n\nIf you’re ready to get started with custom domains for Jira, follow these instructions. We will provide an update on this post when custom domains for Confluence become generally available.\n\nIf you are not already using a Premium license(s), you will need to upgrade to Cloud Premium to enable custom domains for Jira or Confluence. If you’re also looking for advanced scale, security & compliance, analytics, and support, we recommend you evaluate the Cloud Enterprise plan.\n\nURL redirects for even more flexibility\n\nWe’ve heard your feedback and understand that many of you are looking for more flexibility in how you configure custom domains, which is why we also support URL redirects.\n\nIn designing the custom domains solution, we’ve been intentional about balancing security, customization, and open collaboration. Having a two-level domain plays a critical role in making our solution resilient to potential man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. At this point, we do not have plans to revisit the two-level subdomain construct, but customers who would like to use a shorter URL can set up a URL redirect. If you choose to use a redirect, you can create links with a shorter, fully customized base URL that redirects your users to the full URL.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nCustom domains for Jira and Jira Service Management are generally available today. Custom domains for Confluence will become generally available in Q3. Therefore, we will close this ticket 30 days after Confluence custom domains become generally available. This will give you time to use this ticket to ask questions about how to use and access custom domains. After that time, we ask that you raise a support ticket with any questions.\n\nWe know many of you have given feedback about custom domains in the past. If you have additional feedback, we welcome you to share your candid feedback and concerns. We’ll be listening! But as a way to keep the dialogue productive, please note that we will prioritize addressing comments related to the functionality of custom domains and how to use them.\n\nBest,\n\nMoinak Chatterjee\n\nSenior Group Product Manager, Atlassian\n\nCustom Domains for Jira - Early Access Program\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the launch of our highly anticipated feature - Custom Domains for Jira! We are inviting you to join our Early Access Program (EAP) and be among the first to explore and provide feedback on this new feature.\n\nCustom Domains is designed to give you more control over your Jira instance and enhance your branding. This new feature allows you to customize your Jira domain to match your company’s domain, making it easier for your team members to remember and recognize.\n\nTo join the EAP, follow these steps:\n\nExpress your interest on our EAP signup page - Registration link\n\nFill out the form with your details.\n\nAwait your confirmation email with further instructions.\n\nPlease note that the Early Access Program for the Custom Domains feature is limited to a select group of users for now. We encourage you to sign up as soon as possible to secure your spot. We will further communicate regarding the status of your request post mid-January after analysing your response.\n\nOnce you're part of the EAP, we ask that you use the Custom Domains feature and provide us with feedback. We appreciate any insights you can provide about your experience, whether they're about usability, performance, or any other aspect of the feature.\n\nWe are committed to making the Custom Domains feature the best it can be, and we are eager to receive your valuable input. We believe that with your help, we can create a more personalized and effective Jira experience for all our users.\n\nIf you have any questions about the EAP or the new Custom Domains feature, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us at Custom Domains Support\n\nBest Regards,\n\nPrashanth M\n\nProduct Manager, Jira Platform\n\nHi everyone,\n\nCustom domains for Jira Service Management Help Center paid customers have exited beta and generally available! We also have progress to report on work to introduce more flexibility in your custom domains and on a new early access program for custom domains for Jira products.\n\nValue of custom domains for your JSM Help Center\n\nImplementing your own branded URL for your Help Center will make it easier for your customers to find and recognize your brand. Operationally, your customers will have an even more seamless experience getting the help they need from the right places. Greater discoverability enables more self-provisioned help and less time required for your team to manage requests.\n\nIntroducing more flexibility in first level subdomains\n\nSince announcing the open beta for this feature in August, we’ve been working to introduce more flexibility in how you implement your branded URL. Currently, you’re prompted to select from a list of keywords for your first level subdomain, but that part of the domain will soon also be free text. Once first level subdomain flexibility is shipped, it will be available across all future custom domain launches for your various Atlassian products.\n\nEarly access - custom domains for Jira\n\nLast week, we announced the launch of the Early Access Program (EAP) for custom domains for Jira - including Jira Software, Jira Work Management, Jira Product Discovery and the agent experience in Jira Service Management. If you’re interested in joining the program, please refer to this comment and complete this registration form.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nAs we mentioned in August, we’re releasing custom domains support on a per-product basis. Please visit the Atlassian Cloud Roadmap to follow along on progress. We will introduce the per-product leaders in a future update.\n\nBest, Luke\n\nHi everyone,\n\nAs of August 1, 2023, we have released custom domains into open beta for all paid Jira Service Management Help Center customers. With this release comes greater discoverability, customization, and ease of use for your organizations' admins, teams, and customers. For details on the release, please see the Jira Service Management community article.\n\nWhere we are now\n\nWith our open beta underway, we’re happy to share that we are seeing broad-based adoption across our customer base and a high completion rate across customers who begin to setup up custom domains for their organization. Please continue to use the \"Give feedback\" option inside Admin Hub, or email custom-domains-working-group@atlassian.com[|mailto:custom-domains-feedback@atlassian.com], or leave a comment here. We continue to monitor the open beta results and your feedback to inform our approach for what's next.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nOur approach is to release custom domains support on a per-product basis for Jira Software, the Agent Experience in Jira Service Management, and Confluence.\n\nAs a reminder, the timeline for when we release support for each product will vary. You can visit our cloud roadmap or continue to watch this ticket for additional progress updates.\n\nThank you for your continued engagement. We will post another update in the coming months.\n\nBest, Luke\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI am bringing you the latest update on the Custom Domains work. The leaves may be changing around the Atlassian San Francisco office, but I’m happy to report our custom domains work is still green (and on track!) for early access in 2023.\n\nShipping custom domains requires extensive to changes to both our products and numerous pieces of our underlying shared cloud infrastructure. Among product teams, the Jira Service Management team is currently farthest along on this journey. As such, I’m excited to announce they have recently completed detailed, technical scoping and are beginning the implementation to bring Custom Domains to JSM.\n\nIn our last update, we mentioned that the approach to Custom Domains requires the enablement of new security measures. As many of you know, we operate under a multi-tenant SaaS architecture, which allows for better scalability and efficiency, minimizes security risks, among other benefits. This architectural approach also allows a single Atlassian account to be granted access to data across any number of Atlassian organizations, products, and marketplace apps. With the introduction of Custom Domains, we plan to add guardrails for the new third-party traffic controls (e.g. DNS resolver, Certificate Authority, etc.) between the user and the Atlassian systems.\n\nAs a result, we are focusing on added security measures around auth tokens, improved security threat detection, and increased user awareness when they encounter a custom domain. We are also building out corresponding admin controls for managing custom domains in Admin hub.\n\nWhile we are committed to bringing Custom Domains to you as quickly as possible, we must do so with security and the safety of your data in mind. On behalf of the various teams contributing to this feature, thank you for your patience and continued support. Stay tuned for the next update next quarter.\n\nBest regards,\n\nLuke Liu\n\nSenior Product Manager, Admin Experience\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI work with dmeyer and lead Atlassian’s custom domains team and will take over updates on our progress going forward. I know many of you have been eagerly awaiting one!\n\nIn the last 6 months, the team has reviewed our previous technical efforts on custom domains implementation, alongside general security improvements implemented by major web browsers, and we’ve achieved internal consensus on the new approach to deliver this feature for our Jira and Confluence cloud products.\n\nI apologize that this update has not come sooner, but we have been quite busy taking our recommendation through internal security and architectural reviews, and I am happy to report that we are well on our way to fleshing out the execution plan. We will ramp up on execution over the new several months and continue to plan for an EAP for custom domains next year.\n\nSecurity for our customers remains our highest priority and a place where we are unwilling to compromise. While we understand and have deep sympathy for the urgency of delivering custom domains, our focus in the last six months has been finding a more feasible implementation that meets customer requirements, without putting our customers at risk.\n\nI also appreciate that many of you are puzzled by why something that appears so trivial at first glance would be so hard to deliver in practice. We are committed to helping our customers understand the unique complexity of getting a solution out there quickly and safely and are working on a blog post that will unpack some of the underlying technical challenges and constraints we’ve had to overcome.\n\nAcross Atlassian, we are committed to investing where we can have the greatest impact for the most customers possible. I encourage you to check out the full scope of our plans on our public roadmap, custom domains included.\n\nOn behalf of the Atlassian team, we take your feedback seriously and understand both the frustration and the urgency. We are working hard to create the best overall experience for as many customers as possible, in line with our company values. You can share your feedback with me directly: ibagrak@atlassian.com\n\nWe plan to provide the next update on this feature by January 2022.\n\nBest regards,\n\nIlya Bagrak\n\nPrincipal Product Manager",

      "# [User interface differences when switching to Jira and Confluence Cloud](https://success.atlassian.com/solution-resources/cloud-shift/cloud-topics/user-interface-differences-when-switching-to-jira-and-confluence-cloud)\nSwitching from Jira or Confluence Data Center or Server products to their Atlassian cloud counterparts can be a disorienting experience for users if they're not prepared. As the admin, you can help orient your users by understanding how the cloud UI (user interface) and UX (user experience) differs, and then communicating those differences to your users. We've outlined the most significant changes below.\n\nCloud URL\n\nWhen you transition to Atlassian cloud, you’ll have a new cloud site URL to access your Atlassian products. You’ll have the same base URL for Confluence and Jira, but each will have a different suffix:\n\nConfluence: https://yourdomain.atlassian.net/wiki/home\n\nJira: https://yourdomain.atlassian.net/jira/your-work\n\nFor admins: To help redirect people still coming to the on-premise instance to your new cloud site URL, you can apply a site-wide banner in the on-premise versions of Jira and Confluence, or you can add an announcement to your online help center in Jira Service Management.\n\nFor end-users: If you've bookmarked previous Data Center or Server pages, be sure to update them with the new cloud links.\n\nJira\n\nGeneral user interface\n\nThe Jira Cloud UI looks more modern than its Jira Data Center and Jira Server counterparts. (See an overview of the updated core experiences.)\n\nJira Cloud, Jira Data Center, and Jira Server have similar sidebars and horizontal global navigation. Jira Cloud’s main navigation bar gives you quick access to the projects, filters, and dashboards you use most. It also lets you create issues, search, and access help notifications and Jira settings.\n\nInterface details:\n\nProduct switcher: Switch to other Atlassian cloud products, like Bitbucket and Confluence, and go to recent projects.\n\nJira logo and product name\n\nYour work: Get an overview of the things you care most about in Jira. Find issues, projects, boards, and queues you’ve visited, work assigned to you, and your starred items.\n\nProjects, filters, and dashboards: Quickly find and resume work on the things you use most. Your starred items appear at the top of each menu, followed by your recently-visited items.\n\nPeople: See the people and teams you work with, and create new teams.\n\nPlans: See and manage your plans (Premium and Enterprise only).\n\nApps: See and manage apps installed on your Jira site.\n\nCreate: Create issues.\n\nSearch: Find issues, projects, boards, queues, filters, and people.\n\nNotifications, help, Jira settings, and your profile and settings: See what's happening in Jira, get help, and customize Jira’s settings (Jira admins only) and your personal settings.\n\nFor more details, see the Jira Cloud navigation page.\n\nThere is no issues drop-down in Jira Cloud, a significant change from the Jira Data Center format. Instead, a user’s recent activity will appear in the new Your work menu item on the top left, which will include issues. Filters are now a separate menu item and you can find issues using the search bar:\n\nIn Jira Cloud, searching is site-wide and includes Confluence and linked Bitbucket accounts.\n\nThe project board and backlog view are similar in both versions for Scrum and Kanban projects. In the cloud, there’s a 5,000 issue limit per board and, unlike on Jira Data Center, you can plan future sprints.\n\nCloud project view\n\nJira Data Center project view\n\nIssue view\n\nHere's the history of the Jira issue UI:\n\nJira Cloud had a UI. Then they got a new one. The legacy view should be deprecated from all sites at this point (although it can still be reverted to manually).\n\nJira Data Center and Jira Server haven’t had a lot of changes and look close to the old Jira Cloud UI.\n\nIf you're familiar with the Jira Data Center and Jira Server UI, you won't notice much difference from Jira Cloud's legacy UI. However, it is more likely you'll be using the new Jira cloud UI, so the change will be significant.\n\nThe new issue view groups key actions and information in a more logical way, making it easier for you to scan and update your issues. The issue view usually appears as a two-column layout on boards and as a single column in the backlog, but it is responsive to the size of your window.\n\nSee What is the new Jira issue view? for more details.\n\nYou might feel information isn't as visible as it was before, but take a look at the side-by-side comparison to see which fields are collapsed in the new UI:\n\nCloud new issue view\n\nData Center issue view\n\nTeam-managed projects vs company-managed projects\n\nIn Jira Cloud, migrated projects will end up as company-managed projects.\n\nPreviously, team-managed projects were known as “next-gen,” and company-managed projects were known as “classic.”\n\nThe differences between team-managed projects and company-managed projects are outlined at Atlassian Support.\n\nSchemes and workflows might be different on the cloud, depending on your migration process. You'll need to educate your teams about what schemes are available in their Jira Cloud site and how they might differ from what they used on Jira Data Center.\n\nIn Jira Cloud, boards are project-independent, meaning they exist within and are only available to software projects, but they may be powered by filters, including non-software projects. In Jira Data Center, boards are independent and may include any projects or Jira Query Language-powered issues. While you can archive projects in Jira Cloud, currently you can't archive specific issues like you can in Data Center, but this capability is on our roadmap.\n\nNoteworthy new features\n\nAutomation for Jira is now part of Jira Software Data Center 9.0 and Jira Service Management Data Center 5.0. However, many of the automation features developed for Jira Cloud in recent years are not available in automation for Jira Data Center. These include:\n\nThe ability to run rules as another user\n\nIn Jira Cloud, advanced triggers and automation functionality are included out of the box.\n\nLearn more at Jira Cloud automation support\n\nAdvanced Roadmaps: This may or may not be new depending on whether it was installed in your Jira Data Center or Jira Server instance.\n\nThe cloud version of Advanced Roadmaps doesn’t include the ability to create programs — group of plans — which is available on Jira Data Center. As of Advanced Roadmaps v.3.29, UI differences between the Data Center and cloud versions are minor.\n\nBasic roadmaps (project-specific): The roadmap is where you can create, manage and visualize your team's epics. Roadmaps are useful for planning large pieces of work several months in advance and planning large groups of stories across different sprints.\n\nA wider variety of ready-to-use project templates and, in particular, 23 new work management templates, are bundled in Jira Software Cloud.\n\nDevOps insights: Includes Jira graph data aggregation, a richer display, and more insight. Teams can create new branches and see associated development work, including:\n\nBuilds\n\nPull requests\n\nCommits\n\nDeployments\n\nBranches\n\nFeature flags\n\nCustom links\n\nConfluence\n\nHome Page\n\nBoth Jira Cloud and Data Center have a common access point to the home page: the Confluence logo at the top left. In the cloud, there is now a home link on the top navigation. The Confluence Cloud home is vastly different than its Data Center counterpart and has new benefits:\n\n📄 Resume your work by getting back to your pages faster with recent front and center.\n\n👥 Catch up on relevant activity with the new following feed.\n\n💡Discover what’s happening across your company with the updated popular feed.\n\nRead more about the new Confluence home.\n\nCloud home\n\nData Center home\n\nGeneral interface\n\nBoth versions of Confluence have sidebar navigation for pages in spaces. Some elements are in different parts of the page. The left navigation in cloud makes it easy to reorder and regroup pages with a drag-and-drop experience.\n\nAnother key difference is that space tools is now in the top of the left navigation and is called space settings in cloud. We’ve also refreshed the look and feel of the space settings page so it’s easier to find the setting you need.\n\nThe editor\n\nThe editor features some of the biggest UX differences between the cloud and data center versions. While the Confluence Data Center editor has not changed much recently and functions and looks like the old cloud editor, significant changes were introduced to the Confluence editor in the cloud. The cloud version of Confluence unlocks a lot of new templates, and page formatting is very different.\n\nConfluence Cloud has fewer macros, and some macros (such as the office macro) don’t have feature parity. This is why, during user acceptance testing (UAT) it’s important to test all macros used by your teams (see: cloud macros vs Data Center macros).\n\nThanks to live macros, the editing experience in cloud is consistent with the viewing experience. Pages look the same during editing as they do once they're published.\n\nSome macros were intentionally excluded from the new editor to improve performance, but there are alternative methods you can use to get the same results (see here for more details).\n\nCloud “fabric\" editor\n\nData center editor\n\nTo stay up-to-date on features that are rolled out to the new editor, keep an eye on the Atlassian blog, where we announce product changes weekly.\n\nWe’ve introduced collaborative editing, which updates the way drafts behave, and moves to a model that's more consistent with how content should be stored for collaborative editing. We'll call the outgoing model, used prior to collaborative editing, personal drafts, and the new model, shared drafts. The notable differences are:\n\nWhen editing a page prior to collaborative editing, a new personal draft was created for each user and the changes couldn't be seen by other users, as personal drafts are private. Using collaborative editing, a single shared draft is created for each page, and anyone editing the page will see the same draft.\n\nPersonal drafts were represented by a draft class, which extends ContentEntityObject and contains a draftType field indicating whether the draft was a page or blogpost. We're deprecating the draft class in favor of using the existing page and blogpost classes, where a contentStatus field of draft will indicate the object is a draft.\n\nBefore you start a Data Center-to-cloud migration, publish draft pages, because if draft pages contain Jira links or links to other Confluence pages, those links won’t be captured by the link-fixing script Atlassian support runs post-migration.\n\nAutocomplete keyboard shortcuts in the editor\n\nOne of the biggest changes are the autocomplete shortcuts used in the editor. If you're used to the Data Center editor, you might be familiar with the “” wiki markup notation. You'll now need to switch to using the autocomplete slash command, which is a single command, to add macros and tools you might not be familiar with.\n\nNote the following changes:\n\nAction\n\nCloud autocomplete character\n\nData Center autocomplete character\n\nTables\n\n/\n\n|\n\nLinks\n\n/\n\n[\n\nImages\n\n/\n\n!\n\nMacros\n\n/\n\n{\n\nHeadings\n\n#\n\nh1.\n\nLists (unordered)\n\n*\n\n*\n\nLists (ordered)\n\n1.\n\n#\n\nSmart Links reveal important context about links within a Confluence page (or Jira issue) without leaving that page. When you paste a link in the editor, it will transform into a Smart Link. We support Smart Links for Atlassian products and many other third parties. There are a few different ways to view Smart Links. Check them out below:\n\nInline view\n\nCard view\n\nEmbed view\n\nHyperlink … with style. The Smart Links inline view makes your links pop on the page. You’ll see the logo from the source of the link, so you quickly have information about the type of content. When inserting a link to other Atlassian products, you’ll get even more details, like the status of a Jira ticket.\n\nSmart Links card view provides even richer detail. You can see a small preview of the content, plus additional information about it. You’ll also start to see actions added to cards over time.\n\nWhat if you never had to break the flow of work (or leave a Confluence page) to interact with content that lives outside of Confluence? Well, Smart Link embed views help you do it.\n\nRead and edit a Google Drive document, manipulate your Figma file and more, all within a Confluence page.\n\nRead more about Smart Links here\n\nSearch\n\nConfluence Cloud search produces better, more relevant results than Confluence Data Center:\n\nOther editor changes\n\nInline comments when editing: Whether you are editing a page or viewing it, the process for adding inline comments is the same:\n\nHighlight the text you want to comment on.\n\nSelect the add comment button that appears above the highlighted text.\n\nEnter your comment and select save (Ctrl+S or ⌘+S).\n\nThe Data Center editor is full width by default.\n\nAnchor links are automatically created in cloud for headings. Non-heading links still need to be specified by the anchor macro.\n\nAdding attachments will have fewer features and a different UI.\n\nYou can't natively link to or render attachments from other pages. You might be used to setting up image or file libraries that can be referred to from other pages, but instead, you can copy and paste the attachment link directly.\n\nTables in the cloud are edited and managed differently: In general, it should be a more intuitive experience but it may take some time to adjust.\n\nOther new features in Confluence\n\nTeam calendar (now bundled in Confluence Premium)\n\nLanguages: Atlassian's cloud products and apps are available in two dozen languages, with more on the way. See our manage your language preferences page for a complete list of the languages that are currently available.\n\nThe mobile apps for Jira Software and Confluence Cloud are different. If you currently use the Data Center mobile apps for these products, you’ll need to install new apps:\n\nJira mobile: the official Jira app from Atlassian\n\nConfluence mobile for iPhone and Android from Atlassian\n\nAtlassian Access also comes with mobile device management (MDM) for Atlassian mobile apps.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nLink\n\nDescription\n\nWatch the blog to get regular updates on what is changing in cloud\n\nCloud Adoption Toolkit can be used to build and execute a successful adoption and change management plan.\n\nResources include:\n\nAtlassian’s guide to change management and adoption\n\nEmail templates for introducing Atlassian cloud products\n\nSetting your users up for success with Atlassian cloud products: admin guide\n\nQuick start guides for Jira Software and Confluence Cloud: user guide\n\nIdeas to explore:\n\nShare regular updates with users about new features, tips and tricks, etc. in Confluence blog post\n\nQuarterly user feedback surveys\n\nFree self-paced courses that will help your users get up and running in Confluence and Jira in just 90 minutes\n\nPaid courses for leveling up admin skills\n\nAdministration manual\n\nOrganization administration course\n\nA brief overview of the basics\n\nGetting started guides:\n\nFor admins who are new to the cloud landscape\n\nCloud release notes and news.\n\nWatch on-demand webinars as Partha Kamal, our Head Enterprise Product, and Dave Meyer, Sr. Group Product Manager for Enterprise Cloud, walk through the latest features we’ve added to Atlassian Cloud products within the last two quarters as well as the exciting features on our roadmap - including data residency, industry compliance, cloud user limits, and more.\n\nThe Atlassian Enterprise Group's mission is to encourage and foster discussions and thought leadership with the Atlassian Community around a broad spectrum of enterprise-related issues, best practices, use cases, workflows, and any other challenges unique to the space. This group is a place where customers and Atlassians can come together to create feedback loops and have open, honest discussions about Atlassian product plans, ideas, wins, problems, and quality.\n\nWas this content helpful?\n\nConnect, share, or get additional help\n\nAtlassian Community",
      "# [Why are Forge apps unavailable for Jira Premium/Enterprise SANDBOX installations? on 2024-07-18](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/why-are-forge-apps-unavailable-for-jira-premium-enterprise-sandbox-installations/81925)\nWhy are Forge apps unavailable for Jira Premium/Enterprise SANDBOX installations? Doesn’t this place Forge apps at a competitive disadvantage to Connect apps in the Atlassian Marketplace?\n\n(I’m asking this question as both a customer and an app developer.)\n\nJira Premium/Enterprise has a sandbox feature. A feature of sandboxes is that you can add apps for free if those apps are paid-for in your production site. (i.e. You only need to pay for an app once between sandbox and production.)\n\nAtlassian Marketplace apps with a paid subscription on a linked production environment can be added to a sandbox for free.\n\nHowever, I discovered that some of my paid productions apps cannot be added to my sandbox for free. Instead, the Atlassian Marketplace wants me to pay for a second app subscription.\n\nHere’s what is supposed to be displayed when adding an already-subscribed app to a sandbox:\n\nNotice the button says “Add to sandbox” and the caption indicates the app is already purchased.\n\nAnd this is the information bubble:\n\nBut for some apps that are already purchased, you see the normal trial/subscription feature:\n\nExpecting it to be a Marketplace bug, I submitted a support ticket. This was the response:\n\n[App name] is a forge app which means that Atlassian does not provide free apps for the “forge” category of apps.\n\n.\n\nForge is a platform for building Atlassian Jira/Confluence apps just like connect : About Forge\n\n.\n\nIn this case, you can reach out to the app vendor and ask them for approval to extend the app on the sandbox.\n\n.\n\nOnce you have this approval please provide me with a screenshot of it and I would be happy to extend the evaluation of the app for you.\n\nFrom a customer perspective, this feels bad for a few reasons:\n\nIt’s confusing: As a customer, how do I know which apps are Forge apps and which are Connect apps? (And how many customers even aware of Forge vs. Connect?)\n\nIt’s inconvenient: It either costs me more money, or I have to contact individual app vendors and either get a promo code for my sandbox or send approval to Atlassian support.\n\nIt violates the advertised functionality for Premium sandboxes.\n\nFrom a developer perspective, it’s even worse (IMO): Atlassian is strongly encouraging us to adopt Forge, but it seems that doing so could put us at a competitive disadvantage, right?\n\nJira Premium/Enterprise users will be motivated to select a Connect app over a Forge app if they’re using the sandbox feature. I realize that sandboxes typically have fewer users than prod sites, so the extra sandbox subscription should be less than the prod subscription. But still, I would expect most people to opt for a free sandbox installation (Connect) than a paid sandbox installation (Forge). (Obviously, this is assuming the Forge app doesn’t have enough of a differentiation to outweigh the sandbox fees.)\n\nI guess this is a question that turned into a rant. So back to the question…why is it this way? Am I wrong about the competitive disadvantage? Or is it actually a bug and not expected as Atlassian Support claimed?\n\nThanks!",
      "# [Atlassian acquires &amp; integrates Rewatch for AI video messaging by Adrian Bridgwater on 2024-09-02](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/CW-Developer-Network/Atlassian-acquires-integrates-Rewatch-for-AI-video-messaging)\nOh no, a meeting!\n\nPeople don’t hate meetings, not really says Atlassian… what they hate are hate poorly run meetings.\n\n“Our research reveals more than two-thirds (72%) of meetings are deemed ineffective by attendees. When asked why, more than half (52%) of workers cited leaving meetings without any clear idea of the next steps or who owns which task.\n\nCapturing detailed notes and clearly outlining the next steps (with owners and deadlines attached) are meeting facilitation best practices. However, taking notes during the meeting can impact your ability to engage in the moment, and distributing notes and action items can be time-consuming,” blogged Atlassian’s Joe Thomas, on the company news channel.\n\nRewatch is a platform that uses AI to optimise virtual meetings and this technology will now be integrated with Loom, Atlassian’s async video communication tool.\n\nOnce this integration is complete, users will be able to deploy an AI-powered meeting assistant in their virtual meetings to automatically record the meeting, take detailed notes, extract action items, and send follow-ups to meeting attendees as noted above.",
