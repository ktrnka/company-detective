      "# [Microservices [What is it & Top Benefits]](https://www.atlassian.com/microservices)\nUntil about 2013, companies usually built enterprise software by constructing applications as single units with large codebases, a monolithic architecture. As software became more complex and cloud computing gained popularity, this approach became less practical.\n\nThe advent of software-as-a-service products (cloud-delivered applications) allowed companies to use providers, such as Amazon Web Services, to create new servers and add redundancy quickly. This ensured that services stayed online during upgrades. It also ushered in a new era of velocity and agility. Users began to expect quick upgrades and improvements, prompting companies to change their development processes.\n\nCompanies began to break applications into smaller, independent services or microservices. For example, instead of including a messaging inbox as part of a monolithic e-commerce platform, they might create a separate microservice for this functionality.\n\nIn parallel, developers started working in smaller, more specialized groups that modified and improved individual services without risk to the entire application. These groups often took responsibility for the operations of their code, as well — a model called DevOps. To facilitate these changes, project managers began to develop new methodologies, such as Agile, which divides projects into smaller, more frequent releases.\n\nRead on to learn more about the anatomy of microservices-based applications. Also, discover how Atlassian’s Compass reduces complexity while allowing developers to reap the benefits of this architectural model.\n\nMicroservices-based architecture has many benefits, but it also comes with challenges.\n\nOne challenge of microservices is that the independent services generate their logs. This is a disadvantage compared to monoliths' centralized logs, which provide a single source of truth for developers and operations teams. Monitoring and infrastructure management are also more complicated since many moving pieces exist. Testing and debugging are challenging because, unlike monoliths, no integrated development environment (IDE) exists.\n\nAtlassian's Compass can help with all these challenges. Compass facilitates collaboration and allows companies to manage the complexities of distributed architectures as they scale. It does this by bringing the disconnected information together in a central, searchable location.",
      "# [Atlassian developer changelog](https://developer.atlassian.com/changelog/)\nThe new workflow editor is a new experience that is already available to Jira Admins as an alternative to the old editor. Jira Admins can switch between the new and old editors, as well as change the default editor experience for company-managed projects.\n\nUnlike the old editor, the new one previously did not support Marketplace workflow rules. With this change, Marketplace rules can now be added, viewed, and configured using the new workflow editor.\n\nThe new workflow editor doesn’t use drafts. Edits are made to the active workflow, changes are built up in the editing session and published with the update action.\n\nThe configuration in the context provided to marketplace rules will reflect pending changes. They won’t however be reflected in drafts. If your apps are reliant on drafts, some changes may be needed.\n\nWe’ve extended existing APIs to allow vendor rules to determine if the new workflow editor is being used.\n\nFor Connect\n\nThe callback passed to the getWorkflowConfiguration will receive the config as the first argument and a context object as a second argument in the new editor. The second argument will remain undefined in the legacy workflow editor.\n\nFor Forge\n\nAn additional extension.isNewEditor key is set as true in the context object returned from the getContext API in the custom UI bridge. This key will continue to be unset in the legacy workflow editor.\n\nThis change will be shipped for company-managed projects only.

You have two options to move to a supported platform: Migrate to cloud or upgrade to Data Center. Learn more about your options and how to take the next step.\n\nFor the most accurate look at your migration costs, please contact one of our pricing specialists. To assess the costs of moving the apps and integrations from your server products, refer to our cloud migration guide.\n\nThe cloud migration trial is like taking a cloud product for a test drive, meaning you can use it just as you’d use any cloud site to explore features and test your migration. Unlike our standard 7-day trials, your cloud migration trial matches the remaining duration of your Data Center subscription.\n\nStill on server? We offer 60-day free cloud migration trials for server customers with expired maintenance.\n\nWith cloud, you’ll always be up-to-date on the latest features for our products. If you’re unable to move to Cloud now, we recommend Data Center – our premier self-managed offering. To find out more, compare Cloud and Data Center. To see how products compare, you can reference the following pages:\n\nJira Cloud vs. Jira Software Data Center\n\nConfluence Cloud vs. Data Center\n\nJira Service Management Cloud vs. Data Center\n\nBitbucket Cloud vs. Data Center",

Any thoughts?\n\nContext:\nEngineering org of about 250 people \nCurrent use of Jira is pretty standard, confluence mainly for documentation (private and for emerging concepts which have not made it to the ‘official’ documentation yet) and exchange of information/ thoughts.

I thought I'd try to start a little thread here where we can share our discoveries. What I'd love to see, if you have experience with a product and want to share, is:\n\n* Name of product\n* Which Atlassian product would it replace?\n* What are the best parts about it?\n* Are there any gotchas you've noticed?\n* Presence of useful features you care to talk about: SSO, backup/restore, integrations\n\nFor example, [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/). A Jira alternative with an eye toward project management. It worked well for our scrum team, I believe it also supports Kanban. The UI is modern. It's got tons of integrations to things people actually use (e.g. Git, Slack) and the Enterprise level, at least, supports SSO (I don't know if other levels do). Pricing seems reasonable. They do point-in-time backups every 6 hours and allow you to export your data. It's been a few years since I worked with it, but I remember setting up our stories/columns was a little fiddly. And of course, it's a one-trick pony.

This is almost scarier than if it was a global outage. Because it was only 400 customers, but here we are, a week later, and they still have only been able to restore 160 customers. Speaking as an ops eng, to me this reveals a rather terrifying house of cards from a systems architecture standpoint. \n\nThe fact that Atlassian has been in business so long and has never, as a matter of *policy*, been willing to invest energy in restoring a single customer, tells me that this work is simply too laborious for them, too laden with \"if/then\" landmines that you find when services are bolted onto the side of an original systems design rather than thoughtfully integrated at the outset. \"We can't script this because it's too bespoke\" is NOT an enterprise answer to any request. \n\nAnd the folks in this thread who are like \"Whew! We weren't hit, we sure got lucky,\" I say, yeah, you got lucky. This time.

Building native apps is a ton of extra work, so it's good to give exact features that you're looking for. IMO a lot of time a decent PWA with a webview app published on iOS and Android would be a better long term solution (since you can focus most of your limited dev time on making the PWA excellent)\n\n[As someone that builds a hobby PWA this is a pet peeve of mine.

Missing key features like view counts and page stats, the ability to search only within a specific 'pages and subpages (ie a KB), and the organization of 'pages' within a workspace is woefully inadequate for any halfway large organization. Shit you can't even link pages from elsewhere in your workspace without duplicating them under every page they're linked to, its atrocious. Nor can you have sub-pages without them being visibly linked on every parent page. These problems *really* show when your org reaches any significant size. Formatting pages is also nice when you learn all the hacks and glitches to bring it up to pae with the basic functionality of *squarespace*, but unfortunately so much of it relies on you intentionally glitches things that it can and will break your formatting with updates.

I want it to succeed, but I've got some complaints:\n\n- **No \"group-level\" issues**: (Issues are scoped to projects.) My team contains both engineers as well as non-engineers. When there's a bug to report, which project do you create the issue in? We've got a bunch of separate projects because of how we split up our code -- some are \"frontend\", others  \"backend\" for separate services. Best approach is to either (ab-)use \"Epics\" as user stories (good luck explaining to people that they need to ignore the \"Create Issue\" button) or simply move issues to the correct project, possibly from a single empty \"Inbox\" project (which *closes* the original issue and creates a new one *with a new number* in the destination project - making it really difficult for my project manager to keep track of). **Issues are directly coupled to deployable units of code, which places undue burden on bug reporters**.\n- **Issue editor isn't WYSIWYG** - I expect they'll fix this soon; the Wiki editor gained a WYSIWYG option recently.\n- **Can't require specific fields when issues are created** - I've heard people complain about project managers over-configuring JIRA so logging an issue requires filling out a million form items. But it would be pretty great if I could force issue reporters to specify which project to track my time toward when I fill out my timecard, rather than me hound them for it after the fact.\n\nThat's... well, that's most of it. The first is a near-dealbreaker for me; everything else is just an annoyance I can live with.\n\n#### Comment ID i4af2td with +2 score by [(Grunchlk, Reddit, 2022-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i4af2td/) (in reply to ID i47xjy2):\nI tried Gitlab at one point.

Decent community, and support hasn't been terrible yet.\n\nOctopus Deploy is my recommendation for deployment/release management - you actually get to talk to developers when troubleshooting an instance, and they'll actually log in and take a look (with permission of course) rather than just reading you a script.\n\nThat leaves work tracking (jira) and wiki (confluence).

It can import tasks and stories from Jira (with a lot of work figuring out the mapping, mind you). \n\nThe Wiki feature is very good, but lacks the plugin system of confluence, making it less capable (but it's still good enough to write good KBs, SOPs, docs. Writing markdown is made awesome with the Monaco editor.\n\nThe VCS component is probably the most fully featured of all commercial version control products.\n\nThe hosted version is easy to set up, the documentation is very good, the only thing it sucks at is easy backups.\n\nThe SaaS version has an incredible amount of features in the free tier.

People have been putting up with them not fixing stuff for years, but here's my alternative for Confluence.  \n\n\n* Name of product: [archbee.io](https://archbee.io)\n* Which Atlassian product would it replace: Confluence\n* What are the best parts about it: internal + external documentation - hosting with custom domain + authentication options for external-facing docs and one of the better editors.\n* Are there any gotchas you've noticed: not as mature as Atlassian products since it's a startup. On the other side, this means that the new feature velocity is fast (compare it with Atlassian tickets of X+ years and not being addressed)\n* Presence of useful features you care to talk about: SSO w/ Google Workplace, integrations with Jira (if that matters anymore :) ), Github, Slack and 20+ tools like Airtable, Miro, Figma.   \n\n\nNot sure why, but I see product teams use Confluence no matter the problems they face, so I am curious if any of you have moved from it and how that went for you?\n\n### Comment ID i4a6yob with +2 score by [(PaleoSpeedwagon, Reddit, 2022-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i4a6yob/) (in reply to ID i4a0mxi):\nClaudiu, you understood the assignment, thank you for this.\n\n#### Comment ID i4ah1mw with +1 score by [(ClaudiuDascalescu, Reddit, 2022-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i4ah1mw/) (in reply to ID i4a6yob):\nIt's hard to find a good alternative for most tools in the Atlassian stack because they work together, and most managers want to use Jira - no matter the opinion of users.  \n\n\nBut congrats to you for starting this thread.\n\n### Comment ID i4e8nyl with +2 score by [(stedasio, Reddit, 2022-04-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i4e8nyl/) (in reply to ID i4a0mxi):\nArchbee is awesome!

It is a replacement for Jira, once devs get their hands on it, they tend to really like it. In my opinion it is a great product, you can do diffs within phab itself and it is extremely customize-able. Herald rules allow you to do so many odd little jobs. The downside's are we had trouble scaling it up, and it is no longer actively maintained. It was originally developed at facebook, and then spun off into it's own product and company. I believe facebook is still using it in some form or another, underneath a much nicer GUI. If you like to tinker, I still think it is a solid product.

      "# Post ID izu5u3: Everyone hates Jira, but no one stops using it with +117 score by [(dbartholomae, Reddit, 2020-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/)\nHi there!\n\nFrom countless conference discussions and Twitter threads it seems there is a universal haze of developers for Jira as a project management tool. But still, whenever I ask a dev in a company with more than a handful devs - they use Jira. How come?\n\nWhat are your gripes with Jira? Which other solutions did you try? And what was missing in the end?\n\n## Comment ID g6l49vo with +124 score by [(PragmaticFinance, Reddit, 2020-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6l49vo/) (in reply to ID izu5u3):\nIt's more of an artifact of when the company was started. For a period of time, Jira was the go-to tool for project management. Once a company starts using it, it's difficult to build enough momentum to switch to something else. So it sticks.\n\nThe real problem with Jira is that it's too customizable, which makes it easy for people to develop painful workflows and systems. Jira has too many complex options and many project managers feel a need to use as many of the features as they can. If you have an ambitious project manager with Jira admin privileges, you can end up with a mess of workflows, tickets with way too many fields, and other busywork that makes Jira painful to use.\n\nUsing basic Jira, especially their next-gen project format, is actually not that different than any other generic ticket management software. As long as you can keep the project managers from over complicating it, Jira isn't too bad.\n\n### Comment ID g6lby8d with +22 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6lby8d/) (in reply to ID g6l49vo):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID g6lfbzy with +11 score by [(qeomash, Reddit, 2020-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6lfbzy/) (in reply to ID g6lby8d):\nStates are low priority to remove for me.

What they actually hate is the process their company built. \n\nJira can be used to build out pretty much any process, but that makes it also very complex to manage. So people basically sit down and build out \"THE PROCESS\" over a couple weeks, and then never want to touch it again. However, processes need to grow and change as companies do, and when that happens you end up being forced to use your company's antiquated process in Jira while trying to do work in the now. And developers, especially younger ones, blame this on Jira instead of not having a person who can go into Jira and change the workflows to something more sane.\n\nThat said, I have my gripes. It is sometimes VERY slow. It has a big learning curve for customization: you need someone on staff that is good at managing it, and is willing to make changes as the need comes. \n\nI've used Microsoft Team Foundation, I've used Trello, I've used older stuff like HP's thing they bought and mangled a decade ago.

It's actually god awful to find anything in.\n\n### Comment ID g6n28xh with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6n28xh/) (in reply to ID g6l6am9):\nI used Azure DevOps extensively at my old job and honestly prefer it to Jira- what is it that you don’t like?\n\n### Comment ID g6mecji with +1 score by [(sudosussudio, Reddit, 2020-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6mecji/) (in reply to ID g6l6am9):\nOr you could use nothing which I’ve seen at a few truly lost places\n\n## Comment ID g6l2koz with +26 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6l2koz/) (in reply to ID izu5u3):\nMy main gripe with jira was that their web app was really slow and hard to use.

Its a SAAS. It pleases corporate overlords, it integrates well, it's extremely flexible and customizable. There's a lot to be said about sending a help desk ticket over to development for triage without having to do anything but click a button (well, click, then make sure the fields migrate, click two or three more times, and then hope it doesn't fail during the move 🤦‍♀️).\n\nI've had to host and care for it in the past. That was enough to turn me off to it.\n\nI've built really complex workflows with it, and used it for very simple kanban. Even stripped down, it's still too complicated. The wealth of features tend to lead to practices that can be bad for overall productivity even if they look useful on the surface (sub-tasks, for example).\n\nI do like the UX/performance enhancements made in the last few years, but Atlasssian changes things too often, IMHO. \n\nI was bummed when I heard Atlasssian bought Trello. I love Trello. It's been getting a little bloated with features, but it was about perfect for most projects - 3 or 4 columns, flags, maybe stickers, rich text and you're cracking to get stuff done. Simple notifications, good mobile app, it's about perfect. Not sure what the future holds now.\n\nUp side is that we're all devs, and a kanban board is nothing proprietary and a really easy  weekend project ☺️ I'm confident something will emerge to take up the minimalist slack, if that hasn't happened already.\n\n### Comment ID g6oo2n4 with +5 score by [(RICHUNCLEPENNYBAGS, Reddit, 2020-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6oo2n4/) (in reply to ID g6l70t2):\n> Up side is that we're all devs, and a kanban board is nothing proprietary and a really easy weekend project ☺️ I'm confident something will emerge to take up the minimalist slack, if that hasn't happened already.\n\nIf you're a dev managing your own little project something like Github tickets is already good enough but guaranteed that whoever you work for wants all the JIRA features\n\n#### Comment ID g6ou9pw with +1 score by [(schwiftshop, Reddit, 2020-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6ou9pw/) (in reply to ID g6oo2n4):\nI think the big draw of Jira and Trello is the project overview - I haven't seen a UI like that for github issues yet.\n\nIts less effective when everyone's remote, but there's always post-its on a piece of cardboard too. 🧐\n\nOr you can go another route... I had a setup many years ago where I would automatically print out 3x5 index cards when an issue was made in Jira. We'd track them across a physical board - the board was magnetic and I got a box of the 3x5 shelf label holders like they use at warehouse stores to hold the cards.

On the other extreme, subtasks can be trivial things that don't need to be enumerated, so its just noise. So subtasks make it easy to hide work, or make something look more complex than it is, and that kills velocity. Its hard or counter-intuitive to work on subtasks in parallel, which limits the effectiveness of a team.\n\nThis is in my experience, anyway. I have used subtasks for certain things like operations processes so I don't forget steps and can let someone else pick up the work easily. I've found adding a list in the description does the same job and doesn't clutter up the board with issues. Thats another thing - when we've used subtasks they make the board harder to look at - you can easily loose context in certain views (this is configurable and customizable but that's the gross/great thing about Jira).\n\n## Comment ID g6ljfla with +8 score by [(rafuzo2, Reddit, 2020-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6ljfla/) (in reply to ID izu5u3):\nIt’s like democracy: the worst form of government, except for all the others\n\n## Comment ID g6l65fg with +4 score by [(underdaawg, Reddit, 2020-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6l65fg/) (in reply to ID izu5u3):\nWhat do you like?

I recently joined a company (second dev who was hired) who has always outsourced their dev work but then want to bring it in house.  I was tasked to setup the whole devops process. I've always dabbled in a little bit of dev ops but now I'm truly getting into it and am going with a cloud solution. I might not be a true devops guy as some other people in here but I just need some advice on how I should move forward.\n\nWe are going to be a .NET shop for sure and we will go forward with .NET Core for sure. We will probably develop some services in other langauge stacks but .NET what not but .NET will be our mainstay. My manager has started off the company with Atlassian cloud and personnel (not IT) have started using Confluence and JIRA already.  So there's alot of documentation and project planning (for existing projects) have already been done. The internal software team is rebuilding something from scratch with the stuff this company recently outsourced.   \nMy boss said he's set on using Atlassian cloud (JIRA and confluence)  but Bitbucket isn't something he has committed on yet. I really don't see a point to going with staying in the Atlassian ecosystem when we are going to be a .NET shop and all 2 devs we have so far are familiar with microsoft and TFS.  I believe we as the dev team who is doing something from scratch should have free reign to go with doing everything in Azure Devops because the devs are familiar with microsoft already and we are doing .NET core stuff. The dockerization and orchestration integration seems better in Azure as well if we choose to go down that road.    \n\n\nI am currently doing a comparison with feature sets between the two clouds so i have some justiifcation for my manager. What if he says we cna just go with Bitbucket and just use te Azure Pipelines? What if we just use bitbucket pipelines and just deploy to host our application on Azure cloud? Like all of this is super confusing and kind of giving me a headache.  Is it possible to use a combination of Atlassian Cloud and Azure devops? One thing I truly forsee being a pain point in the future is traceability of work becuase the PM side will be in one and the dev side will be in another. We have to stay really diligent on keeping things updated.    \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Comment ID e7za3gw with +34 score by [(Resquid, Reddit, 2018-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/9p5lxa/deciding_on_atlassian_cloud_vs_azure_devops/e7za3gw/) (in reply to ID 9p5lxa):\nTIL Azure literally has a product called \"DevOps\"\n\nJesus Christ... smh\n\n### Comment ID e7zhywf with +2 score by [(monkh, Reddit, 2018-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/9p5lxa/deciding_on_atlassian_cloud_vs_azure_devops/e7zhywf/) (in reply to ID e7za3gw):\nAll the videos I've seen they always call it Azure Dev Ops never just Dev Ops.\n\n### Comment ID e7zk6q4 with +1 score by [(sirius_northmen, Reddit, 2018-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/9p5lxa/deciding_on_atlassian_cloud_vs_azure_devops/e7zk6q4/) (in reply to ID e7za3gw):\nIt's pretty much just like aws codedeploy except shittier.\n\n#### Comment ID e7zvlit with +10 score by [(floppykeyboard, Reddit, 2018-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/9p5lxa/deciding_on_atlassian_cloud_vs_azure_devops/e7zvlit/) (in reply to ID e7zk6q4):\nExcept that it’s not really shitty.

I have actually been looking at a bit of a hybrid approach. I like the way TFS does builds; and as a MS shop it just makes sense. I don't feel the strong need to have every single bit of the tool chain \"integrated\". That said; a little bit of integration is nice and does provide value IMO; if not take to extremes anyway.\n\nOf all of the similar \"work management\" type of tools -- I seem to like the way Jira does it the best. Confluence looks like it'll be an amazing addition to our company in terms of making documentation easy to create and easy to consume.\n\nCurrently I think we'll go with Documentation, task management, and some road map/planning with Jira and have VCS, Build, deploy in VSTS/ADO. We self-host our software internally; so we'll likely always have on prem build servers/agents for TFS.\n\nBased on what I have found; the issues people have with Jira tend to be from trying to over-complicate their processes and then force the tools to do that thing. We've been using trello with some post-build scripts to create release notes from cards, etc for a few years now and it works smoothly. The next jump we need to make is getting everything easily viewable across multiple teams and projects and get some roadmap planning (Portfolio for Jira).

If you want that; sure you'll probably want to go all in on one or the other.

At my last company, we were a .NET shop using Jira, Confluence (both cloud), BitBucket (on prem/datacenter), TeamCity for builds (on prem), and Artifactory (on prem) for artifact management.\n\nRecently I've been using Azure DevOps for a new company, and I'm the administrator/setter upper. I'm not an Azure DevOps expert, but IMO it's not great. The Jira/Confluence/BitBucket/TeamCity/Artifactory tooling was better. Of all the parts in my previous developer toolchain, I'm pretty confident in saying that all of those tools are best-of-breed, except for Artifactory.\n\nSpecifically, I'm not a fan of the Azure DevOps issue/work item tracking - IMO it's not at all intuitive, and there doesn't seem to be much of an issue workflow, as Jira supports. The different boards required to view stories, bugs, and tasks is confusing (to me) - why can't I view all of the above on a single board? While I don't love Jira either (much of the administration schema is really old in the tooth, so there's a learning curve to setting it up well), the user experience for scrum masters, developers, PdMs, and QA in Jira is quite good. After testing many different issue tracking systems, at 2 different companies, Jira consistently came out on top. Azure DevOps just feels clunky and unproductive in comparison. My sense is that much of the issue tracking functionality in Azure DevOps Boards comes from legacy VSTS - it could be done much better with a re-write, but there are probably people out there who either know or depend on backward compatibility.\n\nAlso, there's no good wiki in Azure DevOps. Confluence is excellent - easy to author, organize, extend, and the search works well. In Azure DevOps, you can author markdown files in git - which is great for engineers, and as an engineer I like documentation as code - but it's not a good knowledgebase product that non-devs can maintain. The discussion board that exists on Confluence pages is also unmatched, as is the Confluence plugin model.\n\nAzure pipelines is ok - the cross-platform support is impressive, but IMO the usability of TeamCity is better.\n\nFor my current company (an early stage startup), the key points that are keeping me on Azure DevOps for the time being are:\n\n* It's free for up to 5 users. Jira/Confluence/BitBucket/TeamCity/Artifactory costs a decent amount more per month, whether you're a tiny company or a large company.\n* No parts of Azure DevOps are best of breed, but they're all integrated. You get integrated private Git repos, web based pull requests, issue tracking, git activity in your issues, a workable (markdown) wiki, and builds that automatically fire off on commits and merges. If I switched to Jira/Confluence/BitBucket/TeamCity/Artifactory I'd have to integrate them all.\n* The Azure DevOps git implementation is decent relative to BitBucket - it's not clearly worse (so far)\n* I haven't used the Azure DevOps artifact implementation yet, so I can't comment on a comparison to Artifactory\n* Azure DevOps integrates easily with Office365 (if you're using it) and/or Azure Active Directory for user management - that's something else I'd have to setup going to Jira/Confluence/BitBucket/TeamCity/Artifactory. I think I'd have to setup Atlassian Crowd to use Azure Active Directory users + credentials in Jira/Confluence/BitBucket.\n* Azure DevOps build agents can run on Linux, Windows, or MacOS. Azure pipelines isn't great (relative to TeamCity), and it's slow (relative to on-prem build servers), but the fact that you don't have to setup new build servers or public cloud resources is nice.\n* It's likely that the deploy story from Azure DevOps to Azure (if you're using it) is easier than from a self-hosted build server to Azure\n\nTLDR: Azure DevOps isn't great, but if you're using Office 365 and Azure, the integration between all the different functional areas is a breeze. Integrating a bunch of disparate dev tools (particularly user identity and links between them) is a bunch of work.\n\nWhile I say \"Azure DevOps isn't great\", I mostly give it low marks for the areas that overlap with Jira and Confluence. The other services within Azure DevOps are decent.\n\nFor my part, I'll be keeping tabs on the extent that using Azure DevOps boards is hurting productivity (and moral) relative to using Jira; and the extent to which we \"need\" a product like Confluence. If it gets bad enough, I'll start using Jira and Confluence, and tackle the identity integration project, and the work of getting Azure DevOps git commits to show up in Jira issues, and other integration. My sense is that I'll stick with Azure DevOps git, pipelines, and artifacts, even after switching to Jira and Confluence.\n\nFor your specific situation, I would look at the fact that Jira and Confluence are already adopted as a blessing in disguise. Hopefully identity is done correctly. If that's the case, you can still use the other Azure DevOps features (which are decent), you just have to handle integrating them with Jira and Confluence. That will probably require licensing a third-party plugin or service.\n\n### Comment ID ee407h6 with +2 score by [(SleeplessinOslo, Reddit, 2019-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/9p5lxa/deciding_on_atlassian_cloud_vs_azure_devops/ee407h6/) (in reply to ID e9uvlht):\nThanks for this\n\n## Comment ID e7zlbko with +10 score by [(an-anarchist, Reddit, 2018-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/9p5lxa/deciding_on_atlassian_cloud_vs_azure_devops/e7zlbko/) (in reply to ID 9p5lxa):\nHaving used Atlassian Bitbucket and Bamboo (with the new pipelines as code) and also VSTS/Azure DevOps I would say Azure DevOps easily wins.

This includes Atlassian cloud products which is why we've been using their onprem products. Obviously they've announced a discontinuation of those products.\n\nSo I'm looking into suitable replacements and Gitlab has caught my eye. I have a couple of questions that I thought might be easier answered by the community though as we aren't only working on software in the system.\n\n1. Confluence? We use confluence to host several sections. Some groups use it to develop their procedures and helpful tips. Our sysadmin use it as a \"Knowledgebase\" where they store lots of articles they've written for themselves on how to deal with tricky hardware or very specialized equipment. They also have things like onboarding and offboarding procedures in there\n\n2. General ticketing system. We use the ticketing system in Jira for everything. Our sysadmin tickets go through here as well as our engineers have tickets in here. These two portions are completely devoid of any code and make no use of repositories. Will we be able to setup ticketing \"sections\" for these that follow a workflow. Workflow is very important to our engineers and they can be somewhat complicated moving from status to status and needing certain qualifications to be able to move to next steps.\n\n3. Those are the two big ones, but beyond that I see that there is supported migration from Jira to GitLab so I was wondering if anyone comments on their experience moving from Atlassian Suite to Gitlab. The three main products we use are Jira, Confluence, Fisheye and Bitbucket.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read!\n\n## Comment ID ga9w13d with +12 score by [(tehBarrow, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/ga9w13d/) (in reply to ID jj1efi):\nYou can replace Bitbucket, Bamboo and possibly JIRA with GitLab (and sort of fisheye then). Replacing JIRA mostly depends on how deep down the rabbit hole you have gone with JIRA, ticketing in GitLab is simpler and it is not possible to configure in the same ways as JIRA can be, this can actually a good thing in the long run.\n\nConfluence is sort of unique and possibly best in class when combined with JIRA, GitLab has pages but that is not really a replacement for Confluence. You can however use GitLab and write knowledge articles in markdown files and place it in a  knowledgebase repository and use some Hugo site template to expose them (via pages), can become pretty nice actually. I have seen many teams create very nice and easily searched KB sites that way.\n\nYou need to have a repo or group for tickets, call one sysadmin or helpdesk and you are fine. Workflow is however non-existent, any ticket can be moved to any column without any stops and tickets do not really have a status. You can use labels to simulate this though.\n\nNo idea on the migration, git is always git, so that should not be an issue.\n\n### Comment ID gaai2bk with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/gaai2bk/) (in reply to ID ga9w13d):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID gaamqzl with +4 score by [(lps2, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/gaamqzl/) (in reply to ID gaai2bk):\nCorrect and the wiki is itself a repo\n\n#### Comment ID gaann6h with +3 score by [(tehBarrow, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/gaann6h/) (in reply to ID gaai2bk):\nYeah, but compared to confluence it is pretty weak.\n\n### Comment ID ga9zutn with +3 score by [(guernica88, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/ga9zutn/) (in reply to ID ga9w13d):\nHmmm no custom workflows for issues may actually be a deal breaker.

If people are treating it like Sharepoint and piling files into it, that didn’t feel as polished. They did improve the storage implementation recently so that should be better. Personally not having to deal with Confluence’s wiki syntax is worth a lot but I’d definitely see what your target users think about it since that’s an easy point of friction.\n\n### Comment ID ga9vz6a with +2 score by [(guernica88, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/ga9vz6a/) (in reply to ID ga9vklc):\nOk looks like Confluence may be where I should focus my research.

The first is wikis - GitLab has Project and Group wikis that are similar to confluence. They use markdown and are pretty good.  \n\n\nThe second route is GitLab Pages - With GitLab Pages you can easily setup a website that is hosted with GitLab. It's extremely low maintenance and gives you tons of control. I even write an article here how you can make a self-service portal using GitLab Pages. https://christophertimberlake.com/using-gitlab-as-a-self-service-replacement-part-1/\n\nEdit: updated the link.\n\n#### Comment ID gabifbh with +3 score by [(AngelicLoki, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/gabifbh/) (in reply to ID ga9vz6a):\nKeep in mind that this can usually be done by O365 or GDocs these days too, and a lot of companies use those tools anyway. We use confluence in-house (and we use it with comala publishing to handle the versioning stuff you mention) and it works well, but I'd definitely agree with some of the other folks in this post saying that it may be over complicated for what's necessary these days (we've been using it for \\~6 years now).\n\nEdit: remove unrelated quote",

      "# Post ID 1841wxq: Atlassian Certification Exam Tips 2023/2024 with +20 score by [(razimandom, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/1841wxq/atlassian_certification_exam_tips_20232024/)\nIf you are seeking tips to pass Atlassian Certifications, you may find this article useful. Having started with no prior knowledge, I successfully passed six ACP exams in three months 2 years ago, and I just passed 4 ACP this month to renew my certifications. I am confident that with the right dedication, you can achieve the same.\n\nMy first ACP exam was ACP-600, and at that time, ACP-620 did not exist. I failed my first test because I had no idea the exam could be so challenging. I don't want you to encounter the same situation, so let's skip the success story part and dive straight into some exam tips.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ACP-620 Exam Tips**\n\nThese tips are designed for those who use Jira as a user, not as an admin. This means you are familiar with basic features such as changing status, adding comments, simple gadgets and reports, and modifying field values. Unfortunately, this knowledge alone may not be sufficient to pass the exam. I recommend considering the Cloud exam as a starting point.\n\nWhether you are Cloud or Data Center users, I recommend starting with ACP-620 because you can run Jira Cloud by yourself without installing Jira DC on your local machine or a cloud server like AWS. [The free version of Jira Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/standard) is sufficient for you to prepare for the exam.\n\nExamine the distinctions between team-managed projects and company-managed projects, as well as between Kanban and Scrum. Consider scenarios in which you would opt for Kanban, Scrum, team-managed projects, or company-managed projects.\n\nExperiment with each gadget and report. Understand the information it presents, as questions will guide you in selecting the suitable type of gadget or report based on specified requirements.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with [company-managed](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/permissions-for-company-managed-projects/) project permissions, paying special attention to the nuanced aspects of permissions related to 'Schedule Issues' and 'Resolve Issues'. Note that these project permissions also impact your ability to view the information in fields such as Due Date and Fix Version. Also, remember that 'Move Issues' permission does not mean you can move your issue's status, but you need 'Transition Issues' permission to change your issue's status.\n\nUtilize all board features such as swimlanes, board filters, board sub-filters, columns, and so on. The exam will ask which features to use based on given requirements.\n\nAtlassian shared very [detailed exam topics](https://university.atlassian.com/student/page/840992-acp-620-managing-jira-cloud-projects-certification) including references, which I highly encourage you to read and understand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ACP-610 Exam Tips**\n\nLet's assume you've successfully completed ACP-620—fantastic! By doing so, you've already acquired 80% of the knowledge required to pass ACP-610. The variations between these two exams lie in the fact that ACP-620 encompasses team-managed and company-managed projects, whereas ACP-610 introduces a distinct project permission for project administrators called Extended Project Permission.\n\nExtended Project Permission grants project administrators in Data Center (DC) a specific level of control over Screens and Workflows. Make sure to understand the range of actions a project administrator can perform under this permission, particularly concerning Screen and Workflow management.\n\nA project administrator without Extended Project Permission cannot edit the project workflow. However, with that permission, they gain the ability to edit it with some restrictions. For instance, they can add a status that has already been created by the Jira administrator, but they cannot create a new status from the workflow editor. It's essential to understand both the capabilities and limitations of what a project administrator can do with this permission. You can read more about this permission in Atlassian documentation ([Managing Project Permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/managing-project-permissions-938847145.html)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Udemy Exam Courses**\n\nIf you find it overwhelming to learn all of this, don't worry. During my preparation for ACP exams, I transformed my study notes into a set of questions in Udemy. If I'm not mistaken, I believe you can get it free if your company has Udemy Business account. Let's take a look at these sample questions from Udemy.\n\n**Sample Udemy Course Questions**\n\n*It is a bit slow to load GIFs on Reddit. You can view 10 sample questions* [*here*](https://udemyatlassian.com/atlassian-certification-exam-tips-2023-2024/)*.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/51z468dk8m2c1.png?width=1760&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9ecdeb3980a7c487446aca2dd7ee54bf6b4a1c9\n\nOn Udemy, you will utilize an exam simulator to acquaint yourself with the actual exam timing. After completing the exam, you can access a comprehensive explanation, link to Atlassian documentation, and GIFs in some questions, to enhance your understanding of the answers.\n\n**Sample Udemy Course Explanation**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m8ybve656m2c1.png?width=1620&format=png&auto=webp&s=47aaa45f8fa40ee5d76a6d4122dad75956fc4872\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**You can check other Udemy courses here:**\n\n* [ACP-620 Jira Cloud Certification Exam Practices 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/jira-cloud-certification-exam-practices-acp-620-managing-jira-projects)\n* [ACP-120 Jira Cloud Certification Exam Practices 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/acp-120-jira-administration-for-cloud)\n* [ACP-610 Jira Data Center Certification Exam Practices 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/acp-610-managing-jira-projects-for-data-center)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm currently working on the ACP-100 course, but it will take some time to complete. This is because it involves additional work to set up LDAP and a Mail server, and testing them in various scenarios.

You don't need to have 6 months' of Jira experience, as long as you've enough time to study, you should be good.

      "# Post ID 3n2sc1: Why Fogbugz lost to Jira with +569 score by [(pdeva1, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/)\n\n\n## Comment ID cvkf1gp with +428 score by [(gecko, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkf1gp/) (in reply to ID 3n2sc1):\nI worked at Fog Creek from 2006 to 2014. This article is wrong, even factually, about a lot of things.\n\nFirst, I find the premise that FogBugz \"lost\" a bit odd. It unquestionably never achieved JIRA's ubiquity, but it still exists, Fog Creek still exists, and the money FogBugz generated Stack Overflow and Trello. If that's a failure, then I would love to have another one of that scale.\n\nBut even exploring why JIRA won the majority of the market share is wrong. Here's why that actually happened:\n\n  1. **They undercut us on price for the one market segment we couldn't afford to match.** This is the single biggest factor. Atlassian figured out pretty quickly that they could charge practically nothing for JIRA licenses for 10-person shops, and then make it by having a massive step-up for enterprise licenses. But nearly all FogBugz customers were ten-person shops or less; charging $10 for a starter pack would've murdered our income.\n  2. **They had a functioning sales team; we had only a marketing team (consisting entirely of Joel).** The parent article is incorrect about this. I don't care what you want to call the team; Atlassian had people on staff who built relationships with _managers_ at tech companies. This meant that they were _able_ to land a lot of those enterprise sales that Joel's blog wouldn't reach. If you want to get 10-person shops, Joel on Software is great. If you want to get 200-person shops, you really need someone building up a relationship with managers from day one. We figured this out and did have a sales team, but too late (and again, we couldn't match on price). Again, I'm unclear where the parent article concluded neither company had sales teams; we've both even blogged about them before (e.g. http://blog.fogcreek.com/why-do-we-pay-sales-commissions/).\n  4. **We didn't take VC.** This meant that Atlassian simply had way more developers to throw at the problem at any given point, whereas Fog Creek had to grow much, much more slowly. Throw in the above sales issues, and the problem compounds, badly. Note that neither Trello nor Stack Overflow repeated that mistake.\n  4. **We didn't have a sane agile strategy.** We felt like you could build an agile workflow in FogBugz with the built-in tooling. That's true, to a point, but Atlassian meanwhile made things like Greenhopper, and managers really like things like Greenhopper. And finally, the only technical issue,\n  3. **Our Unix on-site version sucked a lot of resources.** This is different from Wasabi (I'll come back to this in a second), but supporting our on-site Unix installations routinely took 20% of our entire FogBugz dev team, and, at its peak, could take even more. This hurt our development speed, especially compounded with our lower resources.\n\nHere are some issues that had nothing to do with why FogBugz lost in the market place:\n\n  1. **FogBugz was not a focused product.** Most Atlassian shops use JIRA and Confluence; FogBugz bundles both. This is a sales strategy, not a technical one.\n  2. **No partner ecosystem.** We had a partner ecosystem. Plugins could be written in any .NET-using language. We'd even host them and run them on our servers, and we even had fairly good developer uptake for a very long time (e.g. Balsamiq, time tracking, Kanban boards, etc).\n  3. **Wasabi**. If we hadn't done Wasabi, then we'd have had to rewrite all of FogBugz, and that would've killed the company. Wasabi also gave us stuff that developers are only now rediscovering, like code that executes on both client and server (e.g. via server-side/client-side React), that even gave us a development edge. I've written about this at length (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9779133) and won't revisit it, but while I think that Wasabi _targeting .NET_ may have been a mistake, _Wasabi_ itself was not a mistake.\n\n### Comment ID cvkmd2v with +166 score by [(carlfish, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkmd2v/) (in reply to ID cvkf1gp):\nI worked at Atlassian from 2003-2014. Even before I worked at Atlasssian I was a faithful reader of Joel on Software. So I thought I might provide a counterpoint. It's interesting how different a company seems to look from the outside than it was from the inside.\n\n(Although obviously none of what follows is secret insider knowledge, it's all stuff that the company has been pretty open about in the press.)\n\n**We didn't have a sales team.**\n\nWhat Atlasssian's called its ”pre-sales” team was entirely reactive. If you called them they'd have someone who could answer your questions about what the products did, but that was about it. If you asked them for a deal or a discount because you were a big company, they'd politely direct you back to the pricing page on our website. After-sales there was an advocacy team who would occasionally call random customers to ask what we could be doing better, and who would email to remind you your maintenance was about to expire. \n\nThat's basically it. Nobody was out there drinking with CTOs or trying to \"build relationships\" to get sales.\n\nAtlasssian's strategy for large companies was that they are really just lots of small companies that happen to share an office: making sure the low-end of the products were cheap enough that a low-end manager could buy them without asking her boss for permission, and installable on that spare dev box in the corner so they didn't have to get IT involved. In our experience, once one or two small teams inside a company had bought JIRA or Confluence, the products would spread virally to the rest of the company without us really having to do anything but make good software.\n\n**The VC is a red herring.**\n\nAtlasssian, and JIRA especially, was profitable from day one. If there was a single year after 2002 where making JIRA cost more than it was earning, I'd be very surprised. The main reason Atlasssian took VC was because the staff (and I'm guessing the founders) were starting to say it would be kind of nice if the stock options everyone had were worth something one day. Once the VC was taken, most of the money was spent broadening the company's product line: the products that already existed were happily paying for themselves.\n\nAs a sign of how little Atlassian needed the money, the second round of investment didn't go to the company at all - it was entirely staff being given a chance to sell some of their options.\n\nWhich is all a moot point because JIRA was already way ahead of Fogbugz in the marketplace before Atlasssian took funding in 2010.\n\n**Anyway**\n\nAnyway, here's my take on the story. I don't think Fogbugz \"lost\". FogBugz is a successful product that many people love, calling that \"losing\" is pretty insulting to be honest. I think the companies just built different products for different markets, and one market turned out to be larger than the other.\n\nFor the _vital first five years_, JIRA and Fogbugz had diametrically opposed product strategies. Fogbugz was a tightly focused product that eschewed customization in favor of presenting how Fog Creek believed an issue tracker would provide the most benefit for a team of developers. JIRA from day one wanted to be all things to all people: there was no deeper strategy than \"listen to what our customers want and give it to them.\"\n\nSo as Fog Creek got this base of loyal customers who bought into the product's vision, Atlasssian got… everyone else. And everyone else was more people. \n\nWhich is kind of the opposite of what the OP article says. JIRA wasn't \"more focused\". JIRA was so flexible customers were already inventing workflows and custom fields so it could be deployed as a service desk, as a support system, as a legal compliance tool, as an HR/recruiting system and a million other things that surprised the hell out of us when we found out. My wife's favorite example (she ran support in the US, that's how we met) was the dating site that had a \"MARRIED\" resolution in their JIRA instance.\n\nBy the time Fog Creek realized that [the wheels _weren't_ going to fall off the Atlassian donkey cart](http://www.inc.com/magazine/20091101/does-slow-growth-equal-slow-death.html), and deviating from that product vision was a necessary compromise for people threatening to \"[GO OVER TO THE AUSTRALIANS](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/07/20.html)\", the network effect had already set in and they were playing catch-up in the market. Unfortunately, that realization coincided almost exactly with when Atlassian introduced those $10 starter licenses.\n\n#### Comment ID cvknpbd with +70 score by [(gecko, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvknpbd/) (in reply to ID cvkmd2v):\nThanks for the response! I think we're actually agreeing more than disagreeing.\n\nI still think what you're describing as pre-sales counts as a sales team. Fog Creek didn't have a real equivalent; sometimes support would answer questions, and sometimes our SMTPs (management training program), and sometimes developers, and sometimes our office manager, but it was easy for us to lose you/not follow up sanely. Having a person to contact, even if it's purely reactive, counts as sales--especially because, as a developer who wants my company to buy `$foo`, it gives me someone's name and contact info to give my boss. Once we added sales staff (both reactive and outreach), **because we realized we were losing sales to your pre-sales team**, our sales went up, but that happened relatively late in those first five years. So, I hear you, but I still think you're undervaluing what Atlassian was doing there.\n\nVC does indeed sound like it's a red herring; I didn't know that. And I agree that FC's straight-up refusal to implement features was a problem (see my note on agile in my original post).\n\nI did forget another thing though, which actually is another side of both that point and my original post: Atlassian segmented their products like nobody's business. FogBugz was just FogBugz (and later optionally Kiln) so that you'd have just one single thing to decide on, but that corresponded to JIRA + Confluence + Greenhopper (theoretically, anyway), + Crucible + FishEye. Five separate times Atlassian could charge a customer, each of which could individually be cheaper than FogBugz. Five separate solutions that Atlassian could *independently* offer to a potential client, or bundle together. Fog Creek just had FogBugz as a monolithic thing.\n\nThat had two effects: we couldn't do margin pricing, and we didn't know what features actually sold things. Atlassian had neither of these problems, making it easier for them to do whatever, and to make more money doing it.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the clarification.\n\n#### Comment ID cvkuhgv with +9 score by [(okmkz, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkuhgv/) (in reply to ID cvkmd2v):\n> dating site that had a \"MARRIED\" resolution in their JIRA instance\n\nThis is amazing.

Wasabi reminding you of them is not an accident. It's a shame, too, because arsDigita was a good product.

The GC was conservative non-compacting, the standard library had tons of bugs and omissions, there were major issues with multithreaded programs, debugging was a chore, and more. (I'm sorry I'm vague on this one, but it's been at least six years at this point.) We ended up having our own FogBugz fork of Mono that fixed bugs in ways specific to FogBugz and that filled in library functions exactly enough that FogBugz could get work done. (We did submit some of this upstream, but IIRC it was usually rejected precisely because it was incomplete.)\n \n(I argued at the time that we should target Java, but Fog Creek had *much* more institutional knowledge of the .NET stack, so the thought was that patching/supporting Mono would be easier than using Java, IIRC. I didn't agree at the time, but it wasn't obvious that I was necessarily right, either. I think we also considered Python. And all of these options were in turn only possible due to Wasabi, incidentally, without which we'd have been stuck on ASP 3.)\n\nThe secondary issue was indeed just how many things there were to target. To support Windows, we had to test on Windows 2000, Windows 2003 x86, and Windows 2003 x64. Period. To support \"Unix\", we had to test on RHEL (later also CentOS), Solaris, OS X, Debian (later also Ubuntu), OpenSuSE, and more, usually in both x86 and x64 variants (and I'm pretty sure UltraSPARC for the Solaris port, based on the Sun Stations we had for a long time). These also all needed custom installer scripts, and could have custom issues due to various Linux kernel patches being applied or not applied, various packages having or not having certain bug fixes, and so on. We ultimately solved this by bundling our own copies of Apache, Mono, etc., if I recall correctly, and jamming the whole concoction under `/opt`, so at least we'd have the same versions and bugs everywhere.\n\nEDIT: Grammar, and removed a redundant phrase or two that had redundancies.\n\n#### Comment ID cvkjoow with +17 score by [(AlpineCoder, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkjoow/) (in reply to ID cvkfd0n):\n> What do you think the root cause of this was?\n\nI worked at a place that had an \"on-site\" FogBugz installation. Regardless of the underlying technical considerations (why target a stack you know isn't production ready?), at the end of the day it just didn't work very well, hence all the support requests. \n\nEven though we stuck closely to the recommended software and hardware requirements, we just had all sorts of performance and stability problems, most of which never had any resolution from Fog Creek (other than \"maybe try more ram?\"). The thing was laughably inefficient in how much hardware it required to users served.\n\n### Comment ID cvkgrc7 with +20 score by [(ellicottvilleny, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkgrc7/) (in reply to ID cvkf1gp):\nIn 2011, I was using FogBugz+Kiln, and doing stuff with mercurial-clones-as-branching, code reviews, and structured lists of tasks and subtasks, that I still can't do with any other tool.

We too are largely curious and creative builders of things, so this makes sense for us.\n\nIt's worth mentioning we also don't have a sales force. We have a customer service team which is a little different, they respond to those emails another commenter mentioned and help with licensing, invoicing, etc. Nobody is pounding doors and doing deals in the end of the quarter.

Ultimately they weren't doing very technically interesting stuff -- just vanilla application development.  I've since moved into linux kernel development and other low level systems stuff that would have been impossible to work on there.\n\nIn general I always felt that Fog Creek was remarkably effective in hiring great engineers, but the work to do was a little easy (fixing css for old versions of IE doesn't require top minds) so they'd do crazy stuff (transpiling, wasabi, etc.) to keep people entertained.\n\nIIRC, the offers at the time were also pretty financially underwhelming -- Facebook and Google were both paying way more and most of the interns who received offers ultimately ended up at FB or Google instead (like 4 of my co-interns worked at FB with me, and there were 10 of us in total).\n\nThere was also some internship funkiness.  For some reason they had this policy of not telling people when they wouldn't be getting job offers, which was crazy because you could clearly see that other people /were/ getting job offers (Glass doors on the offices).  The whole \"walk out\" interview approach is also pretty crappy -- they ended up walking me out when a relatively junior engineer no-hired me, but that was determined to be in err and my interviews were continued later over the phone.\n\nedit: s/sense/since\n\n### Comment ID cvkzwfb with +4 score by [(Thimble, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkzwfb/) (in reply to ID cvkf1gp):\nHere's my short but lovely story:\n\nWe were using FB quite happily.

Good lord is it slow.\n\nPerformance is not at all a top issue in building market share for a tool such as JIRA.  Stickiness and sales are the main factors.  Sure, performance will have _some_ impact, but nowhere near as much as stickiness and sales.\n\nIf three companies you worked for used it, those companies were paying for it rather than for the competition -- so JIRA must have been doing something right -- even if it was slow.  Why did those companies pay for JIRA rather than the competition?  Because JIRA has great sales, great marketing, great support, and sets it up decently and quickly.  From there, it gets sticky and your company keeps it, even if it is slow.\n\nSlowness will only have a marginal impact on word-of-mouth of those using it, which are only _sometimes_ the same people that are in the position to make the decision anyway\n\nMeanwhile, those able to make the decision to use it will value things like:\n\n- Will I ever hear about this thing? (marketing)\n- Who else uses this (sales, marketing)\n- Can I justify my decision to upper management? (sales, marketing)\n- Do I believe this will work for me?  (sales)\n- Does it fit into our workflow (customizable, so yeah, sales will say \"yes\")\n- Will my company know how to use it? (sales, support, ubiquity)\n- If no, will they train me? (sales, support)\n- How long to get it set-up? (sales, support)\n- Does it fit our budget? (sales)\n\nWhether they decide to keep it or not:\n\n- Cost in dollars\n- Cost of switching\n- Does it do what we need it to do?\n\nNotice none of the above include \"performance\".  It just needs to get sold, and work marginally well.\n\n### Comment ID cvkkcte with +5 score by [(get_salled, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkkcte/) (in reply to ID cvkf32w):\nJIRA's actually pretty fast if you aren't using their web UI (it sucks); I've built custom command-line tools using its REST interface and they are night and day faster.\n\nIf you _must_ use JIRA and find it slow, it's definitely worth your time to build tools using its REST interface.\n\n#### Comment ID cvkuun1 with +16 score by [(silverbax, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkuun1/) (in reply to ID cvkkcte):\nThe insight is appreciated but getting a tool that you have to build a UI for in order to use effectively is not a selling point at all.

Some people are more productive with vi or emacs, others are better with a paid tool like Sublime Text or Ultraedit. When big decisions are made regarding the project itself, it is similarly sensible to take the input of the developers into account: if they say language X or framework Y will provide advantages, why would this not be investigated?\n\nThere will always be managers to convince and beancounters who need to OK such expenditures, but those two typically do not have the insight and experience as to what the job actually involves, and how it can be improved upon.\n\n(Obviously, every person is susceptible to a hype-train, so any expenditure ought to pass some sanity checks.

You find a good tool, put it on the company credit card, and perhaps even convince your teammates to use it. But in company with hundreds or thousands of developers? Each team might use their favourite tools... until a high-level manager decides to standardise on something else for \"more synergy\".

I use and prefer JIRA to FogBugz, but I've worked in plenty of places that still use FogBugz, and while it feels a bit out of date, it's not unsalvageable.\n\nWith that being said, I think the only way for FogBugz to regain its foothold is for a rebuild, and that largely goes against one of Spolsky's beliefs. Fog Creek *could* create a competitive JIRA replacement with current technology, but I don't think it can be built on top of FogBugz without significant work.\n\nAnyone that uses Atlassian tools is well aware that their tools work, but they often lack polish.

Wasabi\n\nIIRC Wasabi was made back in early 2000s when they wanted to actually *sell* the software to clients who already had an infrastructure of either using PHP, (classic) ASP or some other incompatible web tech and didn't want to rewrite the software in every language so instead they wrote their own meta-compiler for that. Also IIRC Wasabi was a VBScript superset and at the time it was made, VBScript was popular (via classic ASP) enough to be able to find programmers who would learn it easily. And TBH i doubt any half-decent programmer would be unable to learn a new scripting language. It might take a couple extra days but unless they did something total alien, it'll most likely look and behave like one or two languages most programmers have already used.\n\nI'd guess that at the time they made it, being able to support all sorts of otherwise incompatible systems was an advantage for them.\n\nThe Haxe programming language does exactly that: provides a base language that can be \"compiled\" to other languages, such as PHP, Java, C#, C++, JavaScript, etc. Of course Haxe was made several years later.\n\n### Comment ID cvkddg1 with +33 score by [(None, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkddg1/) (in reply to ID cvkcjyl):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID cvkmgx2 with +1 score by [(nullabillity, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkmgx2/) (in reply to ID cvkddg1):\n> But on a platform like Haxe or Wasabi that would require that the target languages support extensions too. \n\nNot quite, if you can translate the theoretical language ExHaxe to Java then you ought to be able to translate it to Haxe too, unless it depends on the platform runtime.\n\n#### Comment ID cvlx9c2 with +1 score by [(badsectoracula, Reddit, 2015-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvlx9c2/) (in reply to ID cvkddg1):\n> But on a platform like Haxe or Wasabi that would require that the target languages support extensions too.\n\nI don't know about Wasabi, but generally Haxe is much richer as a language than the targets it supports.

I feel it's a hammer looking for a nail.\n\nEach to their own I'm sure there are plenty devs out there that probably love JIRA.\n\n#### Comment ID cvkd0vr with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkd0vr/) (in reply to ID cvkbcw1):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID cvkc5vn with +27 score by [(TheAnimus, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkc5vn/) (in reply to ID cvkbcw1):\nI've used it a view times, but not recently, so maybe things have changed.

Current agile methodology does not mesh with this base concept.  You end up creating frameworks to manage groups of tickets and harassing your people to complete them and do the appropriate data entry in the appropriate fields so they show up in the applicable buckets.  \n\nThe end result is that you end up changing agile to work with your ticketing system rather than have a system that works with agile.\n\n### Comment ID cvkdrix with +11 score by [(xconde, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkdrix/) (in reply to ID cvkb9mf):\nFunny enough, one of my biggest gripes with Jira is its flexibility.

But that's not the issue. The issues are:\n\n- you spend 10% of your time looking at a loading spinner (I get 1-2.5mb page loads on *every link* - if there's one thing that would benefit from drinking the SPA kool-aid, it's JIRA)\n- you spend 70% of your time looking for where they've hidden the very simple thing you need to do\n- you spend 10% of your time refreshing the browser when more than one person is moving things about at once\n- you spend 8% of the time marvelling at the inconsistencies in the UX design (you can drag to reorder stories in the backlog, you can't do so to reorganise sub-tasks on the story view, and a million other things)\n- with the remaining 2%, you very occasionally get something done.\n\nJira is where UI design goes to die. There's just such a cascade of things that are just *slightly* less than usable that sustained exposure causes a kind of creeping nausea. You can't quite remember when exactly it was you started to need to retch, but you sure as hell do now.

I don't know if that's a good or bad strategy, since it appears that Fogcreek lost for reasons mostly unrelated to it. As a developer I still like the strategy though (how could I not?).\n\n### Comment ID cvkbi60 with +2 score by [(ledasll, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkbi60/) (in reply to ID cvkb6bo):\nand everyone knows that Splolsky is guru for advises, how to do development and business\n\n## Comment ID cvkdw27 with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkdw27/) (in reply to ID 3n2sc1):\nFor me Fog is a negative word, connoting confusion, lack of clarity.\n\nBugz is a negative word, too.

Fogcreek invented their own language. This meant they couldn't use all of the ecosystem and amazing tooling around Java, which Atlassian was able to take advantage of. \n\nHa! JIRA isn't so much an example of \"taking advantage of Java\" as demonstrating how Java can be made to be even slower than Ruby on Rails. And Confluence is so buggy that for awhile it wouldn't let you put a period at the end of a paragraph. \n\nSeriously. I had to type some other letter, hit the back arrow, type the period, and then delete the extraneous letter.\n\n## Comment ID cvkms2x with +3 score by [(mdoar, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkms2x/) (in reply to ID 3n2sc1):\nMaking JIRA work well is possible but does require knowing the tool, not hacking at it. But the hard part is not knowing how to configure JIRA, it's getting all the teams in your company to agree on a small number of workflows and custom fields. Everyone wants their JIRA project to be unique for them until persuaded otherwise.\n\nDisclaimer: I spend my work days running consulting teams that help people to understand JIRA.

Each employee already costs thousands! If you can spend $10/employee to get even a 1% productivity increase, it's unbelievably worth it\n\nCompanies aren't price sensitive at those numbers, even smaller ones.\n\n### Comment ID cvkg6af with +10 score by [(miyakohouou, Reddit, 2015-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvkg6af/) (in reply to ID cvkfdrm):\nMy experience is that what you are saying makes perfect rational sense, and I've never been in an environment where it's true.  Getting access to hardware and software has always been like pulling teeth, sure it might make your employees more efficient, but their salaries are already \"spent money\" so why not just make them go through a few extra steps to save money.  Besides, software and salary are different colors of money, and so you can't compare them fairly anyway.

A lot more configurable, but installable next to your Bugzilla instance, and you could import all your bugzilla bugs. More importantly, your bugzilla instance was on a linux box, next to your tomcat servers etc.\n\nFogbugz was a Windows product. As a Perl Web Shop, PHP and Java shop, that basically excluded it.

Today I received an email 7 weeks after I was laid off that started with, “ Congrats on your first year at Atlassian—we know that's a huge accomplishment and are beyond thrilled to be celebrating with you!” It was a bummer to receive that, to say the least, but it included a link to leave this Glassdoor review to “ help provide invaluable insight to future candidates and help us to improve your experience as an employee continually.” so here I am. My advice is to do proper change management of your automated emails when you layoff 5% of your workforce so that emails like this aren’t sent to hard working former employees that you eliminated congratulating them on a milestone they never reached.

You can fill those seats with new graduates who don't know any better, but they'll reach the same conclusions eventually.\n\nYou built a great company and you're slowly destroying it. I've never seen anyone burn through as much good will as you did starting in 2023.\n\nI hope things improve. I'd still be there if not for those bad changes.

The ramp up to onboarding is supposed to be 2-4 weeks before start the role (doing the work) and some get thrown into the fire faster, depending on leader, needs and fires to put out. Recent change in 2025 to benefits sharing, employees will start contributing to health benefits (really cool they didn't used to) but will now have employees take part in costs sharing. Its minimal but still sad to see it go away, but understandable. Travel for EA's can also vary by team and Leaders needs, so this is a bit all over the place.

It’s truly an art form here. If you're not on a PIP, are you even really working? The company’s commitment to ensuring everyone feels the thrill of living on the edge is truly admirable. It's like a rite of passage—every month brings a fresh wave of anxiety and excitement. Who needs job security when you can have constant, gut-wrenching uncertainty?\n\nNow, about the PR count. Atlassian has managed to turn code reviews into a competitive sport. Forget about writing clean, functional code. It’s all about the numbers, baby! Your worth here is measured in pull requests like you’re a racehorse on a track. The more, the better, right? Never mind if the quality suffers—what’s important is hitting that next PR milestone. And, oh, the thrill of having your PR comments count scrutinized as if each one were a personal reflection of your professional worth!\n\nAnd let’s not forget the working environment. The long hours and relentless pace make it feel like you’re in a corporate version of The Hunger Games. Survival of the fittest becomes your daily mantra as you navigate through a battlefield of endless tasks and shifting priorities. It’s a test of endurance where every day feels like a quest to avoid the next corporate elimination.\n\nIn summary, if you’re looking for a job where you can feel perpetually on edge, where your every PR is tallied and analyzed, and where the work environment resembles a high-stakes survival game, Atlassian is your dream destination.",

Nobody feels safe about their job.\nAs a senior individual contributor, my performance was meant to be measured in terms of \"impact\", which is only vaguely defined.\nThis translates into senior engineers launching all kinds of useless, or even harmful projects, just so they can claim they made such an impact.\nUnfortunately, I found myself with a clueless manager, who, three months into the job, told me I would have been let go because of \"lack of impact\".\nI wonder what kind of impact he expected in such a short time at a complex company like Atlassian, but he never clarified.\nI tried to prove myself in many ways, but it was never enough, or the right way.\nHe never helped me understand how I could have been more effective. Instead, at every 1-1, he always expressed his disappointment, with no constructive feedback whatsoever.\nOne of their core values is \"Play, as a team\", which is funny, because it should be \"Everyone for themselves\".",

But, if the “leadership” is a few months late to provide an update we’re only told that “they’re working on it”. The same applies to the company's abrupt transition from extremely aggressive hiring to lay-offs within a two month period, there was no acknowledgement of potential errors that may have occurred. - In the past few months, the executives' tone of voice has shifted to somewhat passive-aggressive. Sure, it’s difficult macroeconomic conditions, but there’s better ways to communicate that we need to switch strategy. At least for the organisation that Atlassian was aspiring to be. - A lot of toxic positivity, especially from the middle managers. Every re-org is celebrated like it was the the best decision ever. It's especially annoying with more challenging announcements like purging the Development Manager role. - Your career and overall well-being are heavily dependent on your direct manager. If you're fortunate, you have the potential to advance significantly, but if you're unlucky, you'll experience a burnout. And too many good people have become miserable because of bad managers at Atlassian. It’s basically impossible to escalate a conflict with your manager.",

People that I worked with were welcoming and truly living the Atlassian values.\n\nOvertime, the culture turned backwards, no more recharge days and they introduced more and more performance metrics to measure us against each other. People are more anxious and in a race to increase their PR counts. There is also a strong focus on proving your individual contributions, hence we need to constantly collect evidences on our work and impact. All of this combine leads to a never ending burn out. \n\nIf you already in a job that you enjoy and considering Atlassian, I would advise to really rethink if the salary and advertised benefits are really worth your mental health. Also the benefit policies are constantly changing, so they might not be as great in the coming future.",

          "cons": "Atlassian used to be a great place to work, but management has deteriorated significantly, often seeming eager to find reasons to lay people off. After more than eight years with the company, it's disheartening to witness such a decline. The new rating system is unfair, downgrading employees despite their hard work. Unless you're working 25(yes 25)/7, you won't receive a decent rating, you aren't demonstrating much 'Org impact.'\n\nBeing a woman in tech is challenging, but being a mother in tech is even tougher. Despite the generous maternity leave policy, many new mothers, including myself, have received unfair poor performance reviews, leading many to leave the company. During my time here, I've experienced over three reorganizations and countless white male managers. When I finally had a manager who supported my goals for promotion, they were let go.\n\nWe’ve become worse than Meta, preaching admirable values but living in a 'Hunger Games' environment. At least with Meta, you know what to expect. The pressure to merge a certain number of PRs affects both performance evaluations and mental health. With everyone rushing to merge PRs, it's an incredibly stressful race—ironic for a company that preaches work-life balance. Asking for help in public channels often leads to management questioning your abilities; I’ve seen it happen repeatedly. Bringing concerns to HR feels like talking into the void. Lastly, We used to have free insurance, but now that benefit is going away. I used to love working here, but now I dread every day.",

Today I received an email 7 weeks after I was laid off that started with, “ Congrats on your first year at Atlassian—we know that's a huge accomplishment and are beyond thrilled to be celebrating with you!” It was a bummer to receive that, to say the least, but it included a link to leave this Glassdoor review to “ help provide invaluable insight to future candidates and help us to improve your experience as an employee continually.” so here I am. My advice is to do proper change management of your automated emails when you layoff 5% of your workforce so that emails like this aren’t sent to hard working former employees that you eliminated congratulating them on a milestone they never reached.

Sure, it’s difficult macroeconomic conditions, but there’s better ways to communicate that we need to switch strategy. At least for the organisation that Atlassian was aspiring to be. - A lot of toxic positivity, especially from the middle managers. Every re-org is celebrated like it was the the best decision ever. It's especially annoying with more challenging announcements like purging the Development Manager role. - Your career and overall well-being are heavily dependent on your direct manager.

After more than eight years with the company, it's disheartening to witness such a decline. The new rating system is unfair, downgrading employees despite their hard work. Unless you're working 25(yes 25)/7, you won't receive a decent rating, you aren't demonstrating much 'Org impact.'\n\nBeing a woman in tech is challenging, but being a mother in tech is even tougher. Despite the generous maternity leave policy, many new mothers, including myself, have received unfair poor performance reviews, leading many to leave the company. During my time here, I've experienced over three reorganizations and countless white male managers. When I finally had a manager who supported my goals for promotion, they were let go.\n\nWe’ve become worse than Meta, preaching admirable values but living in a 'Hunger Games' environment. At least with Meta, you know what to expect. The pressure to merge a certain number of PRs affects both performance evaluations and mental health. With everyone rushing to merge PRs, it's an incredibly stressful race—ironic for a company that preaches work-life balance. Asking for help in public channels often leads to management questioning your abilities; I’ve seen it happen repeatedly. Bringing concerns to HR feels like talking into the void.

The ramp up to onboarding is supposed to be 2-4 weeks before start the role (doing the work) and some get thrown into the fire faster, depending on leader, needs and fires to put out. Recent change in 2025 to benefits sharing, employees will start contributing to health benefits (really cool they didn't used to) but will now have employees take part in costs sharing. Its minimal but still sad to see it go away, but understandable. Travel for EA's can also vary by team and Leaders needs, so this is a bit all over the place.

This in my case is placing a reference document on a related ticket. Right now the link is viewable and is clickable, but it shows the full URL for a confluence page which is looooong and I would like this to look similar to what you can do with an HREF tag in HTML. Is there a way to do this using jira automation?\n\n<a href=\"url\">link text</a>",

Our customers have embraced AI with open arms, increasing their use of it nearly 10x so far this year.\n\nNow, less than six months later, Rovo is generally available for all customers and we have some really exciting Atlassian Intelligence innovations across our portfolio.\n\nAtlassian Rovo is generally available to unlock knowledge at scale\n\nSince we announced Rovo in May, thousands of customers, partners, and Atlassians have been putting it to the test as part of a closed beta program. Early feedback from Rovo beta users suggests 1-2 hours of time saved per week on average, nearly 75% say Rovo helps them get work done faster, and nearly 80% say Rovo helps them find the right information at the right time. Their input has helped us shape and refine Rovo into a tool that truly elevates teamwork.\n\nFind what you’re looking for with Rovo Search\n\nWith Rovo, you can unlock enterprise search for your entire organization—not just your Jira and Confluence users—by connecting data across the SaaS tools you use every day. It cuts through the noise to deliver quick and personalized insights.\n\nAs you connect more data sources to Rovo, your organization’s teamwork graph becomes that much richer:\n\nRovo Search Connectors help you find the information you’re looking for, whether its from across your Atlassian products, GitHub pull requests, or files stashed in your Google Drive.\n\nData Center customers can experience the magic of Rovo with the data center connector, which unlocks a trove of on-premises data to fuel rich AI responses, starting with Confluence Data Center.\n\nLearn in the flow with Rovo Chat\n\nRovo Chat is not just any chat. It is the go-to expert on your organization from whom you can learn in any context without having to switch between different tools or hunt information down. It can help you distill tremendous amounts of company information into a personalized conversation that helps you get your answers fast.\n\nAnd now, the Rovo browser extension brings the magic into any website and apps like Google Docs.\n\nTake action with Rovo Agents\n\nThink of Rovo Agents as teammates you can pull into your workflow that can save you hours or days of work, while also getting you better outcomes in the process.\n\nYou can get Rovo Agents out-of-the-box, from our Marketplace Partners, or even build them yourself. To help you get started quickly, we’re providing over 20 out-of-the-box Agents. Learn more about a few of our favorite pre-built Agents.\n\nBeyond the Agents that come out of the box with Rovo, you can setup and configure your own Agents with code or no-code to accelerate company onboarding for new hires, enforce brand and style guidelines for company content, and more.\n\nBecause Rovo Agents are extensible by default, we can bring you even more agent capabilities through our Marketplace. Partners like Appfire, Usertesting, Onward, and Zapier are already demonstrating the potential of building Rovo Agents on our platform.\n\nReimagining how developers save time in the AI era\n\nWe’re also launching a new early access program for engineering teams to reduce friction across their workflows. Developers lose over eight hours weekly due to inefficiencies in processes and collaboration. Today, AI assists in code completion, but isn’t addressing the majority of tasks that get in the way of development velocity and quality, like getting started on a task with unfamiliar requirements, searching for information, or waiting for pull requests to be reviewed. We’re looking to change all that with our new dev-focused AI Agents.\n\nFrom issue to PR faster than ever before: AI Agents can automatically generate code plans, code recommendations, and pull requests based on task descriptions, requirements, and context across the organization, right in Jira.\n\nFast track PR reviews: From your favorite source code management tool, instantly analyze code, receive recommendations for areas of improvement, and even get suggested code edits within the pull request, all from an AI-powered Agent.\n\nBring context to the IDE and stay in the flow: Reduce the time you spend looking for information with the Atlassian Rovo for GitHub Copilot. Get access to critical context—from knowledge about goals, teams, and projects to design specifications, recent deployments, and open issues—right from your IDE. Everything is accessible by simply chatting with @atlassian-rovo in Copilot.\n\nTo join our early access program, add your name here and start removing friction everywhere you build.\n\nAtlassian Intelligence continues to deliver native AI in Atlassian products\n\nAnnounced today at Team ’24 Europe, our newest in-product AI features help customers reduce friction for developers, promote better collaboration across all teams, and accelerate service delivery and incident management.\n\nAI-powered service delivery and incident management:\n\nAccelerate incident workflows: New AIOps capabilities in Jira Service Management use AI to group related alerts and surface critical incidents, suggest the right resources and SMEs, summarize details to bring new responders up to speed, capture key incident timeline events, and generate a post-incident review.\n\nDeliver exceptional AI-powered support, fast: The same Jira Service Management virtual service agent experience that automates support requests in Slack is now available on the help center, Microsoft Teams, email, and the embeddable widget for external customer support. New onboarding and automation enhancements, along with advanced performance insights are coming soon!\n\nLoom’s integration with Atlassian products gets superpowers with AI:\n\nSave time with Loom’s AI-powered, automated workflows: Through deeper integrations with Jira and Confluence, you can generate documents in 50+ languages, create bug reports and pages from Looms that are sent to you, and populate Jira issues from a single screenshot of a Loom video.\n\nThese are just a small sample of all the AI newness we’re bringing to customers. To learn more about the full list of AI capabilities coming to Atlassian’s platform and how to access them for your organization, visit the feature overview guide.\n\nWith AI from Atlassian, better teamwork starts today\n\nWith Rovo, your team can get AI-powered search, chat, and agents all in one to unlock organizational knowledge at scale. The results in beta are already nothing short of remarkable, and we’re just getting started. We’re also constantly adding new ways for you to supercharge work across products with Atlassian Intelligence, from Jira to Confluence to Loom and then some.",

The exact date depends on the feedback we receive after this announcement.\n\nBy default, the role is assigned to all project permissions in permission schemes and all issue security levels in issue security schemes. As a result of this change, the possibility to manage that role’s permissions and issue security levels, both via the UI and the REST API, will be restricted.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the planned changes, please leave them under this public ticket.\n\nCreate custom domains for your Jira products\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe removed keyword restrictions when you create custom domains.

This is optional.\n\nReview changes and select Create domain.\n\nData residency for Marketplace apps\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen evaluating data residency for your apps, you might see some apps listed as \"No action available.\"\n\nThis means that some app partners declare that their apps don't need to be pinned or migrated because their apps exclusively store data within the Atlassian product. Another reason is that the apps may not store any data in the scope of the Marketplace partner's data residency policies.\n\nTo request a data residency move for your apps, you will have first to move your product. Learn more about how to move your product from one location to another\n\nOnce your product has been pinned to your selected location, you can move your eligible apps to the same location. Learn more about data residency for Marketplace apps\n\nStay on top of your organization’s security\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe improved the security guide so you can see your security setup in one place.\n\nUnderstand your organization’s mix of users and their login methods at a glance.

So now people who have Jira, and have recently also added Jira Product Discovery, will see simple recommendations on how to start using Jira Product Discovery. For example, inviting teammates, using a template, etc.\n\nThat means it’s easier to know what to do first in Jira Product Discovery so that you’re getting the most out of it.\n\nThe recommendations will show up in the ‘Your work’ part of Jira, and everyone with either a Free, Standard, or Premium plan will see them.

Through customers' feedback, we've heard that when these workflows are opened in the new editor view, they're often hard to read, misaligned, and generally not nice.\n\nTo solve this, we’ve updated how the global transitions and the status lozenges render in the new editor view. See the image for a before/after comparison.\n\nOther small but mighty changes to the workflow editor include:\n\nCollapsable transition labels in the New Workflow Editor\n\nNew shared transitions in the New Workflow Editor for company-managed projects\n\nRead our community post about these changes to learn more.\n\nTemplate recommendations in your Projects directory have a new home\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you click on ‘Projects’ in your top navigation in Jira you land in your Projects directory. Previously, recommended templates were listed at the top of this directory.\n\nNow, the templates we recommend sit to the side. You can display and hide them as before; the main difference is that when you hover over any of the templates, you can see a preview of what that template looks like and how it works.\n\nWe've also changed the logic behind the recommendations so that they’re more specific and useful.\n\nBringing Plans and Overviews together!\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re bringing together the best of Jira Software and Jira Work Management into a single project management tool, so all your teams now have a shared place to get sh*t done.\n\nAs of this release note, we're launching the migration of Overviews in Jira Work Management into Plans in Jira Software.\n\nFind out how this supercharges your planning experience\n\nUse Atlassian Intelligence to define words and acronyms in the issue description\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now use Atlassian Intelligence to define acronyms and one or more words in the issue description.

It's now a focused discovery page with a centralized hub for admins to effortlessly discover and install first-party (1P) and third-party (3P) integrations.\n\nThis change means the page will no longer serve its previous function of managing connected tools and opsgenie teams. We've also removed the Edit connections button from the \"Code\" page that previously linked to the \"Toolchain\" page.\n\nIf you need to manage security containers, head to the “Security” page in Jira. From there, you can utilize the connection manager sidebar.\n\nFinally, we've introduced a new Swap container button on the \"On-call\" page. This button replaces the Change connected Opsgenie team button.\n\nImproved search using summary and description fields\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re boosting performance in the issue navigator by changing how the search field works behind the scenes. When using the search field, results will be based on the Summary and Description fields.\n\nBefore this change, results were based on multiple text fields such as Summary, Description, Comments, and any custom text fields, which caused results to be slower to load.\n\nIf you’d prefer to search using text fields, select More + to view additional field filters, then select Text.\n\nTo try it out, head to the issue navigator by going to your project, then select Issues in the sidebar.\n\nNew ways to edit card covers\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNow you can easily choose a color or an attachment, or upload a new card cover.\n\nSelect the action menu on the bottom right and choose \"Edit cover\"\n\nBulk edit issues in Jira list\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nBulk edit up to 1000 issues at one time from your Jira list.\n\nTo bulk edit multiple issues:\n\nSelect multiple issues from your list using the issue checkboxes.\n\nOnce you’ve chosen the issues you’d like to edit, select Edit from the toolbar that appears.\n\nA sidebar will open which allows you to make edits for the shared fields across your selected issues.\n\nView even more issue information from your Jira list\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nView project, groups, cascading select, radio buttons, resolution, and status category information as field columns.\n\nTo view your new fields, scroll the list all the way to the right. You can then organize your fields how you like.\n\nShorter, saveable, downloadable, emailable reports for Assets\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've got a whole bunch of improvements in store for Reports for Assets in this release... Reports are now distinct dashboards, can be saved for ease of access later, can be downloaded, and can even be emailed to you!\n\nInline create for custom CMP boards\n\nYou can now create cards directly on boards with certain custom board filters.\n\nCopy and share a link to your Jira dashboard\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe're adding a \"Copy link\" button to let you share your Jira dashboards in other Atlassian products, such as on a Confluence page, whiteboard, or database. These links can be displayed as a card in Confluence to make it easier to share your Jira data with others.\n\nConfluence sprint retrospectives are now available on company-managed projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe are adding a prompt to company-managed projects to launch a sprint retrospective in Confluence as a whiteboard or page.\n\nPreviously these options were limited to team-managed projects.\n\nWhen you finish a sprint, you'll see an option to collaborate with your team in Confluence using our sprint retrospective templates. You can pick a whiteboard or a page.\n\nCreate multiple help centers on your site to serve different audiences\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nCreate multiple help centers on your Jira Service Management site and customize each of them for your various teams or audiences. Each help center can feature distinct branding, topics, portals, and announcements to effectively cater to specific user groups.\n\nYou need to be a Jira admin to create and manage multiple help centers.\n\nTo create a new help center:\n\nGo to Settings > Products > Jira Service Management > Configuration.\n\nIn the Help center section, select View all help centers.\n\nYou’ll be taken to the help center management page. Select Create help center.\n\nEnter a name and URL slug for your new help center and select Create.\n\nWe've also moved all the help center settings to a single place. Select your avatar from any help center on your site and you can find your requests, profile settings, and customization capabilities in the menu.\n\nGroup notifications in one email\n\nChoose when you want to get notified about issue activity and we’ll group your notifications into one email.\n\nWe’ll group notifications for the same issue into one email. You can then choose how often you want to receive notification emails for an issue.\n\nTo group notifications together:\n\nSelect Settings > Personal settings.\n\nSelect Projects and issues.\n\nTurn on the toggle to the right of Group notification emails together.\n\nUse the dropdown menu to choose how often you want to receive emails.\n\nInline create for boards with query swimlanes in company-managed projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now create cards directly on boards with certain swimlanes configured with JQL.\n\nThis announcement marks our fifth iteration of inline card creation for boards in company-managed projects.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAs part of our ongoing work to speed up the performance and improve the reliability of Assets in Jira Service Management, we're making a few minor UI changes.\n\nThis change involves that little counter at the bottom of the object list - it's getting updated to show a maximum count of 1000 objects, more than that and it'll show 1000+. And if you ever want to see how many more than 1000 that is, then simply select the 1000+ and it'll update to show the full object count. Simple huh? Happy Assets-ing!\n\nGet notified when your issues transition to another status\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIn team-managed projects, users can now receive a separate email when an issue transitions to a different status.\n\nPreviously, users in team-managed projects received the same email regardless of whether an issue was edited or transitioned to another status.\n\nProject admins can now enable a separate email to notify their team when an issue is transitioned. This provides more granular control about email notifications and reduces clutter for users who are only interested in issue transitions.\n\nTo enable email notifications to users when an issue is transitioned:\n\nFrom your project’s sidebar, select Project settings and then Notifications.\n\nSelect Add notification.\n\nUsing the dropdown, search for and select the issue event An issue is updated by a workflow transition (generic event).\n\nSelect the users and roles that will receive this notification.\n\nSelect Add.\n\nMore about customizing notifications in team-managed projects\n\nSmall change to the Automation audit log - we've updated the look and feel of the date picker to make it easier to use.\n\nTo check it out:\n\nNavigate to automation:\n\nFor Confluence automation, go to Confluence settings > Automation\n\nFor Jira automation, go to Jira settings > System > Global automation\n\nSelect Audit log.\n\nSelect Status and choose which statuses you want to filter by.\n\nUse Confluence templates in pages you create in Jira\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you create a Confluence page from a Jira issue, you now have a choice of templates to add to your page.\n\nFrom the Jira issue's drop-down menu, select Create and choose Page. We will start a draft and you'll have the option to choose a template from a list on the right side of the page.\n\nJira’s dot menu will be removed from August 19\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nWe’ve removing the dot menu in Jira to make way for a new and improved command palette.\n\nThe dot menu will be removed across Jira from August 19. For a more seamless experience, users will be able to access the command palette to find work, update their issues, access project and admin settings, and more.\n\nTo get started with the command palette:\n\nOpen the command palette.\n\nIf you’re a Mac user, press command + K to open the command palette.\n\nIf you’re a Windows user, press Ctrl + K to open the command palette.\n\nSearch for commands in the search bar or use a forward slash / to search work.\n\nMore about the command palette\n\nWhy are we removing the dot menu?\n\nJira\n\nROLLING OUT NEW THIS WEEK\n\nWe’ve improved the messaging in errors for calendar releases in business projects to make it clear what’s happening and how to fix it.\n\nMove data between sites with cloud-to-cloud migration\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe're introducing cloud-to-cloud migration to make it easier for you to move users and projects from one cloud site to another. Cloud-to-cloud migration can help you combine data between two or more cloud sites, split a cloud site into multiple cloud sites, duplicate a cloud site, or move specific projects from one cloud site to another.\n\nOrg and site admins can access this feature by logging in to the cloud site you want to move your users and projects from, then going to Settings > System > Migrate cloud site.\n\nThe new global issue create experience is enabled for all instances\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve modernized and optimized the experience to create issues to make it fast and scalable. Note that you won’t be able to switch back to the old experience.\n\nUse the GitHub for Jira app to connect GitHub Enterprise, instead of DVCS\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nJira admins making a new GitHub connection for a new organisation now need to install the GitHub for Jira app. The app functions just like the DVCS Connector, but with better security features and improved performance.\n\nThis only applies to new GitHub connections in new organisations. Existing connections using DVCS are not affected.\n\nLearn more about the GitHub for Jira app.\n\nControl what you see in your products\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nProduct recommendations now have controls, so now you can dismiss them or learn more about why you’re seeing them. These controls are being added to the recommendations in the app switcher menu which means you'll have more control and receive better product recommendations.\n\nYou can select the three dots next to the recommendation to learn why we have recommended it or to dismiss it entirely.\n\nThe recommendation controls will first be released to both Free and Standard teams of up to 50 users. Note: Only admins will be able to add a new product by clicking on the recommendation.\n\nRetiring the possibility to manage the atlassian-addons-project-access role\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nFollowing up on our previous announcement, we’re planning to remove the possibility to manage the atlassian-addons-project-access role in two to six months. The exact date depends on the feedback we receive after this announcement.\n\nBy default, the role is assigned to all project permissions in permission schemes and all issue security levels in issue security schemes. As a result of this change, the possibility to manage that role’s permissions and issue security levels, both via the UI and the REST API, will be restricted.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the planned changes, please leave them under this public ticket.\n\nOrganize and track work against Compass software components\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now link issues to Compass components from any company-managed Jira Software project.\n\nThis helps your team organize and track work in Jira against elements of your software architecture cataloged in Compass – so you can understand the impact of that work; prioritize work more effectively; and find the information you need to get that work done faster.\n\nLearn more about Compass components\n\nSwitch to Compass components (project admins)\n\nIn your project sidebar, select Components.\n\nCheck that Compass components are turned on. Next to Create component, it should say Compass components. If it says Jira components, select it and switch to Compass components.\n\nJira components won't be deleted, and they'll still be visible on issues they were previously linked to. You can switch back to Jira components at any time.\n\nRead the full documentation\n\nLink issues to Compass components\n\nIf you don't have Compass yet:\n\nOn the Components page, select Get Compass free. It'll take a couple of minutes to set up.\n\nOnly site admins can do this; if you're not a site admin, you can send a request to your site admin to get Compass.\n\nIf you have Compass, but don't have any software components:\n\nOn the Components page, select Create component. Compass will open in a new tab.\n\nFill out the information for the new component, including the name, type, owner team, and related source code repository link.

You must be a Jira admin to do this.\n\nTo connect pending Bitbucket workspaces on the Code page:\n\nGo to Code in your project menu.\n\nSelect Connect workspace in the blue banner to connect a workspace.\n\nTo connect pending Bitbucket workspaces using the development dialog:\n\nNavigate to an issue in your project.\n\nOpen the development dialog by selecting either a branch, commit, pull request, build, or deployment from the development panel.\n\nSelect Connect workspace in the blue banner to connect a workspace.\n\nRead more about integrating Bitbucket with Jira\n\nUse filters to search and display Jira issues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNow you can use filters to search for Jira issues and display them in a list, without leaving the Confluence page.\n\nThis improvement follows the release that allows you to search for issues using keywords or JQL, and flexibility to add, remove, and reorder fields.\n\nHow to display Jira issues in a list\n\nStart using filters to search for Jira issues:\n\nEdit a Jira description or comment.\n\nType /jira and select Jira issues.\n\nWith Basic selected, use the filters to search by Project, Type, Status, or Assignee.\n\nSelect Insert issues.\n\nThis will display your selected issues in a list format you can interact with.\n\nTo edit your list of Jira issues:\n\nSelect anywhere on the list.\n\nSelect the Edit button (left-most icon) from the menu that appears at the bottom of the table.\n\nEdit your search query using Basic or JQL.\n\nSelect Insert issues.\n\nMove a mighty amount of issues from a completed sprint\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nDidn't get through all the issues you'd planned to in a sprint (we're talking more than a thousand or so)?\n\nTake a moment to pause while they're dropped into a new sprint, a sprint that you've already created, or your backlog.\n\nColourful categories\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nProject admins can now assign colours to categories from the list view in Jira.\n\nManage custom fields for your project in context of the list view\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now create and manage custom fields in context of the list view.\n\nCertain types of work may require specific information for your team to get the job done. Jira now allows you to create and manage these additional fields in context of the list view to save you from navigating away from your work.\n\nThis will help your team with viewing the right, relevant information upfront when completing tasks.\n\nTo get started with the change, select the plus symbol at the top right of your list view to show or hide more fields, and manage your custom fields.\n\nTrack and triage incidents affecting your services in Jira\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re excited to roll out the new incidents feature in Jira Software Cloud.\n\nThis feature pulls in data from connected incident management, monitoring, and observability tools, so your development team can have a holistic view of incidents impacting services they are responsible for.\n\nOur first supported product is Jira Service Management, and we plan to add support for more incident management and observability tools soon.\n\nBy turning unexpected incidents into manageable, visible work, you can improve your team’s focus on quick resolution and internal review while building proactive work practices to prevent incidents from happening again.\n\nTo get started with the incidents feature:\n\nFor some customers who use Jira Service Management, the feature will be available and automatically appear under Operations in the list of features.\n\nTo turn it on manually:\n\nGo to Project settings > Features.\n\nToggle Incidents on.\n\nWe're gradually rolling out the incidents feature over the next few weeks to specific customers. If you don't see it yet, check back again soon.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nJira site admins can now finish setting up code and deployment tools by following a link from the issue view. If any site admin has installed a tool on your site, we'll show a link on the development panel so you can finish setting it up.\n\nIf a code tool has been installed but not configured, we'll show a link to Set up code tools.\n\nIf a deployment tool has been installed but not configured, we'll show a link to Set up deployment tools.\n\nTo get started:\n\nGo to your Jira project and open an issue.\n\nIn the development panel, select Set up code tools (or Set up deployment tools).\n\nIn the dropdown, select the tool you want to set up.\n\nFollow the steps to finish setting up your integration.\n\nFilter results dashboard gadget improvements\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThe gadget now displays issues in the same way as they appear in the issue navigator.

We’ll create a personalized Create issue form for each issue type and project.\n\nAll the fields you don’t use will be hidden in a More fields section, so you'll always be able to interact with them. The feature is continuously learning. If we notice you using a previously unused field, we’ll pull it out of the More fields section for the next time.\n\nWe’ll automatically turn on the feature to hide unused fields when creating issues, but you can manage it by heading to Personal settings and finding to the Jira labs section. From there, you can use the toggle to opt in and out of the feature.\n\nGet suggestions for child issues from AI\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nUse Atlassian Intelligence to generate a list of suggested child issues, based on the details of the parent issue.\n\nWhen you accept a suggestion, a new child issue will be created and linked to the parent issue.\n\nTo see a list of AI-generated suggestions:\n\nOpen the parent issue.\n\nSelect Add a child issue under the issue summary.

Here are recommendations for how to structure your data for Assets schemas.\n\nSee also: How to build an effective ITAM schema structure.\n\nFor this reason, we're introducing a maximum cardinality limit of 20,000 per object type attribute for Assets. Read more about recommended data structures for Assets.\n\nExceeding these limits can cause performance and reliability issues, therefore each site cannot create further items once they reach the limit. You can find out how many objects your site currently contains using the feature usage screen. Read more about how to track your usage.\n\nCustomize your navigation\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nProject admins can control what the team sees in the project view navigation.

You can now create, rename, move, set constraints for, and delete columns without leaving the board. You’ll still have the ability to do all of the above in your board’s settings page, but if you’ve only got time for a quick fix, we’ve now got you covered!\n\nIf you’re a project or board admin for the board you want to update, you can try the following changes:\n\nTo create a column, select the + icon to the right of all columns.\n\nTo rename a column, select its name to edit directly.\n\nTo move a column, select its top, then drag the column to its new position.\n\nTo set column constraints, right-click its name or hover to select more actions (•••) > Set column limit.\n\nTo delete a column, right-click its name or hover to select more actions (•••) > Delete.\n\nThe team field in Jira issues now shows the team icon\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nPreviously, selecting the team field in an issue would prompt a search displaying the singular \"Person\" icon. The correct \"Team\" icon now shows to indicate what should be selected for the field.\n\nDrag and drop to reparent issues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve made it easier to reparent issues in the timeline and list views.\n\nWe’re slowly rolling out this feature, so don’t worry if you can’t see this yet.\n\nIn the timeline and list views, you can now reparent a single issue by simply dragging and dropping it underneath a new parent issue.\n\nJira: Import from ClickUp\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nMoving your work from ClickUp to Jira just got easier.

As a result of this change, the possibility to manage that role’s permissions and issue security levels, both via the UI and the REST API, will be restricted.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the planned changes, please leave them under this public ticket.\n\nUse filters to search and display Jira issues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNow you can use filters to search for Jira issues and display them in a list, without leaving the Confluence page.\n\nThis improvement follows the release that allows you to search for issues using keywords or JQL, and flexibility to add, remove, and reorder fields.\n\nHow to display Jira issues in a list\n\nStart using filters to search for Jira issues:\n\nEdit a Jira description or comment.\n\nType /jira and select Jira issues.\n\nWith Basic selected, use the filters to search by Project, Type, Status, or Assignee.\n\nSelect Insert issues.\n\nThis will display your selected issues in a list format you can interact with.\n\nTo edit your list of Jira issues:\n\nSelect anywhere on the list.\n\nSelect the Edit button (left-most icon) from the menu that appears at the bottom of the table.\n\nEdit your search query using Basic or JQL.\n\nSelect Insert issues.\n\nFilter results dashboard gadget improvements\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThe gadget now displays issues in the same way as they appear in the issue navigator. When you configure the gadget, changing the displayed columns and their ordering also works the same as in the issue navigator.\n\nTake a look at the improvements by adding a new Filter results gadget to one of your Jira dashboards.\n\nHide unused fields when creating issues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThere can be a lot of fields to scroll through when you’re creating issues, and we know there are many fields that are simply unused.\n\nWe’re introducing a feature that only brings up the fields you actually use. We’ll create a personalized Create issue form for each issue type and project.\n\nAll the fields you don’t use will be hidden in a More fields section, so you'll always be able to interact with them. The feature is continuously learning. If we notice you using a previously unused field, we’ll pull it out of the More fields section for the next time.\n\nWe’ll automatically turn on the feature to hide unused fields when creating issues, but you can manage it by heading to Personal settings and finding to the Jira labs section. From there, you can use the toggle to opt in and out of the feature.\n\nChat in Slack: Emoji shortcuts are now powered by Jira automation\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nEmoji shortcuts, based off Halp’s legacy recipes, now use Jira automation’s powerful no-code engine. With this change, admins can manage all automation rules in one place and emoji reactions can be used to edit issues created by Assist in Slack — all allowing for a simpler configuration experience.\n\nIf your projects have custom emoji rules, you have until June 4, 2024, to set up similar ones in automation. After that date, the emoji shortcut feature in chat settings will no longer function.\n\nFind out more in our Community blog\n\nBefore you start setting up your new automation rules, keep in mind:\n\nThe ticket emoji shortcut used to create issues isn’t affected by this change, so you don’t need to set this up in automation.\n\nYou need to set up the eyes emoji shortcut, which assigns agents to issues. Tip: Use the template from the Emoji shortcuts tab in chat settings to quickly set up this automation.\n\nTo set up emoji rules in automation:\n\nFrom your project settings, select Automation.\n\nSelect Create rule.\n\nSelect Emoji reaction to Slack message as your trigger*.*\n\nSelect Turn on rule, name your rule, and then Turn on rule again to save.\n\nTo help test your new emoji rules, you can now turn off emoji shortcuts in chat without deleting them:\n\nSet up your emoji rule in automation.\n\nFrom the Emoji shortcuts tab in chat settings, find the rule to turn off.\n\nUse the toggle to turn off the rule.\n\nTest to your satisfaction.\n\nUse Atlassian Intelligence to define words in the issue description\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now use Atlassian Intelligence to define one or more words in the issue description. The definitions will be based on information found in connected Confluence spaces.\n\nTo use Atlassian Intelligence to define words:\n\nMake sure the description is in view mode, not edit mode\n\nHighlight words you need defined\n\nSelect Define\n\nDefinitions are only available in the description in view mode.\n\nMaximum cardinality limit on multi-value attributes in Assets\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAssets in Jira Service Management is a database and so requires a combination of good data modeling and a great deal of processing power to handle large amounts of data. Here are recommendations for how to structure your data for Assets schemas.\n\nSee also: How to build an effective ITAM schema structure.\n\nFor this reason, we're introducing a maximum cardinality limit of 20,000 per object type attribute for Assets. Read more about recommended data structures for Assets.\n\nExceeding these limits can cause performance and reliability issues, therefore each site cannot create further items once they reach the limit. You can find out how many objects your site currently contains using the feature usage screen. Read more about how to track your usage.\n\nData limits for object schemas in Assets\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAssets in Jira Service Management is a database and so requires a combination of good data modeling and a great deal of processing power to handle large amounts of data. Here are recommendations for how to structure your data for Assets schemas.\n\nSee also: How to build an effective ITAM schema structure.\n\nFor this reason, we have introduced limitations on how many objects, attributes, and attribute characters can be stored inside schemas within each individual Assets in Jira Service Management site. Read more about how much data you can store in Assets.\n\nExceeding these limits can cause performance and reliability issues, therefore each site cannot create further items once they reach the limit.

Read more about how to track your usage.\n\nBeta: Group alerts using Atlassian Intelligence\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThis Atlassian Intelligence feature is in beta. Read more about Atlassian Intelligence features.\n\nAtlassian Intelligence groups related alerts and offers insightful suggestions, helping your team manage alerts and resolve issues more effectively. Alert grouping lessens 'alert fatigue' for your on-call agents. Rather than dealing with each alert separately, they can view a collective summary of similar alerts through an alert group. Over time, Atlassian Intelligence learns to recognize new alerts, identify patterns, and improve grouping based on user feedback.\n\nTo use the alert grouping feature, make sure that your organization admin has activated Atlassian Intelligence from Atlassian Administration. To access the feature, go to the Alerts page and switch to AI view. This works only if you’re using the new alerting feature that's natively available in Jira Service Management.\n\nRead more about alert grouping\n\nThe team field in Jira issues now shows the team icon\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nPreviously, selecting the team field in an issue would prompt a search displaying the singular \"Person\" icon. The correct \"Team\" icon now shows to indicate what should be selected for the field.\n\nJira: Import from ClickUp\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nMoving your work from ClickUp to Jira just got easier.

Find the comment section, and start creating an internal note. Then, select the Comment visibility button. Select which group or project role you’d like to restrict this comment to. Now, save your comment.\n\nOnly the comment creator and users added to the selected group or project role will see this comment once it’s saved, meaning you can continue to work knowing your confidential request information will stay private to you and your team.\n\nFind out more about project roles in Jira Service Management, or learn how to create and manage your groups.\n\nCalendar view for new Jira Service Management projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re excited to launch a new view of issues in Jira Service Management: calendar view! Like the board or your queues, the calendar is another way to view and manage your work in the way that works best for you and your team.\n\nIt’s a great way for team members to plan, track, and prioritize, and for team leads to see potential roadblocks before they cause delays. Read more about using the calendar to view your issues.\n\nCreate a new project, then select Calendar in your project navigation to check it out. You can schedule issues in the calendar by adding and filling out the Start date and Due date fields on an issue. Once those fields are filled, the issues will appear on your calendar so that you can view your work across the coming month and beyond.\n\nAt the moment, the calendar is only available in new Jira Service Management projects, but it will become available for your existing projects soon, alongside new and improved calendar features to help you and your team do their best work.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've made some minor updates to the AI issue triage feature. Issues that can't be updated are now grouped together to allow for easier scanning and comprehension at a glance.\n\nAttach a form directly from the request type configuration page\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve made it even easier for admins to attach new forms to request types without needing to navigate to form settings.\n\nAfter selecting Attach form when in request type, you can now choose to either create a new form from the form template library, or search and select an existing form.\n\nSelect Create from template to browse over 200 form templates with pre-built conditional sections and rich formatting to help get you started sooner. Or Select existing to search all forms across your entire project.\n\nRead more about adding forms to request types\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you move or bulk move issues to different projects or issue types (or migrate an issue type out of a project), you can now select the new request type during the move. We're excited to release this much-requested update to make issue migration simpler in Jira Service Management.\n\nRestrict request types in both company and team-managed service projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou may have request types in your service project that only specific people should be able to raise. Now you can control who can and can't raise these requests in Jira Service Management in both company and team-managed service projects!\n\nGive access to specific people and groups, and automatically restrict access to all others. If someone doesn’t have access to a request type, they won’t be able to raise that request as it won’t show up as an available option to them - even via search.\n\nRead more about restricting request types\n\nJira Product Discovery\n\nUse the GitHub for Jira app to connect GitHub Enterprise, instead of DVCS\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nJira admins making a new GitHub connection for a new organisation now need to install the GitHub for Jira app. The app functions just like the DVCS Connector, but with better security features and improved performance.\n\nThis only applies to new GitHub connections in new organisations. Existing connections using DVCS are not affected.\n\nLearn more about the GitHub for Jira app.\n\nNew granularity level for the timeline\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've increased the granularity displayed in the timeline to improve the overall experience.\n\nWhether you have chosen quarters or months for your timeline, you can now resize cards between months and half months.\n\nNew summary layout in your timeline\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIn your timeline, you can now change the card layout to a summarized one.

We've made it possible for page owners to transfer ownership of their page to another person at any time. Space and site admins can also transfer page ownership from one user to another.\n\nThis way, if a current page owner leaves a project, team, or company, ownership of the page can then be granted to whomever is most appropriate, and maintenance and validity of the page remains fresh.\n\nA page owner is the ‘point person’ for a given page and their name appears in the byline, under the page title.\n\nLearn more about page ownership and how it can be transferred\n\nControl what you see in your products\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nProduct recommendations now have controls, so now you can dismiss them or learn more about why you’re seeing them.

For those who prefer their tables to respond dynamically to screen sizes, we’ve increased the maximum scaling to give your tables even more flexibility.\n\nHow to use:\n\nInsert or select a table on your page.\n\nSelect the Table options icon in the table toolbar.\n\nSelect the Fixed column widths option to prevent your table columns from scaling down on narrow screens.\n\nThis update allows you to maintain the integrity of your table layouts across different screen sizes, providing a more consistent viewing experience.\n\nAutomation: Project created trigger\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nOne for the Confluence automation fans! You can now trigger Confluence automation rules when a Jira project is created.\n\nFor example, you could create a rule where every time a Jira project is created, Confluence creates a corresponding space and pages.\n\nTo give this a try:\n\nNavigate to Confluence automation\n\nFor space automation, go to Space settings > Automation\n\nFor global automation, go to Confluence administration > Automation\n\nWhen creating or modifying a rule, select Project created in Jira as the trigger.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now transfer ownership of your whiteboard, database, or Smart Link in the content tree to another user. Space and product admins can also make this change when needed.\n\nThis functionality was previously only available for pages, and ensures that the right person is always associated with the content.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now comment directly on inline elements such as emojis, statuses, mentions, dates, and inline cards (Smart links). Users can now leave comments on these specific elements, streamlining the commenting process and making it more intuitive and efficient for providing feedback and collaborating on documents.\n\nSmall change to the Automation audit log - we've updated the look and feel of the date picker to make it easier to use.\n\nTo check it out:\n\nNavigate to automation:\n\nFor Confluence automation, go to Confluence settings > Automation\n\nFor Jira automation, go to Jira settings > System > Global automation\n\nSelect Audit log.\n\nSelect Status and choose which statuses you want to filter by.\n\nBitbucket\n\nCache key support for self-hosted runners\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nSince releasing cache key support for builds on the Atlassian infrastructure earlier this year, we have been actively working to add cache key support for our customers who are using runners. That being said, we are happy to announce that we now support runners using cache key to generate caches. Additional documentation on smart caches with cache keys can be found in the following section of our Caches help documentation: Caching with file-based cache keys.\n\nCompass\n\nUpgrade your Compass GitHub app to allow Compass to ingest pull request data\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAccept the updated permissions for your Compass GitHub app to authorize Compass to enrich the PR data/insights we show you in Compass.\n\nUpgrade your Compass GitHub app:\n\nIn GitHub, go to the organization settings for the organization that you've connected the Compass app to.\n\nSelect GitHub apps on the left sidebar.\n\nSelect the Review request link.\n\nEnter your GitHub password.\n\nSelect Accept new permissions.\n\nYou're now on the latest version of the Compass GitHub app.\n\nAtlassian Analytics\n\nVisual SQL: Write custom formulas using Atlassian Intelligence (AI)\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou no longer need to worry about memorizing SQLite syntax for custom formulas. You can use natural language to tell AI how you want to transform your data, and AI will generate the SQLite expression for you.\n\nTo try it out:\n\nAdd a Formula column or Apply formula step.\n\nSelect Custom from the formula options.\n\nSelect AI.\n\nUse natural language to describe how you want to transform your data.\n\nSelect Submit.\n\nPowered by Confluence and Scroll Viewport.",
      "# [Latest updates](https://developer.atlassian.com/jiradev/latest-updates)\nWe release new versions of our Jira Data Center products frequently. As a Jira developer, it's important that you're aware of the changes. The following resources will help you keep track of what's happening.\n\nAtlassian Developer Community\n\nMajor changes that affect Jira Data Center developers are posted in the Atlassian Developer Community, like announcing EAP releases, adding new Jira modules, or the deprecation of API endpoints. You'll also find handy tips and articles related to Jira development.\n\nCheck out our Atlassian Developer Community\n\nEarly Access Program\n\nAn Early Access Program (EAP) release is a public development release leading up to the official release of a Jira version. Development releases are a snapshot of our work in progress, primarily focused on allowing Jira users to see the new features in advance and provide us with some useful feedback. EAP releases can include changes like:\n\nChanges to our APIs\n\nDatabase changes\n\nChanges to Jira bundled apps and libraries\n\nChanges in our supported platforms\n\nDownload the latest Jira EAP release\n\nEAP releases include more mature Beta Release and Release Candidate (RC) but they generally don't introduce new changes. Instead, they provide bug fixes and tweaks to features introduced in earlier EAP releases.\n\nLatest EAP\n\nThe EAP releases give you an opportunity to test and fix your apps in advance of an official release. Refer to the following table to prepare for the latest Jira version.\n\nJira Software 10.4 and Jira Service Management 10.4\n\nJira Software 9.x/Jira Service Management 5.x\n\nStarting from 9.13 and 5.13, new Jira releases support only Data Center licenses. If you try to upgrade to the Data Center-only release with your Server license, Jira will fail to start, and you'll need to downgrade to the version you were on before the upgrade or provide a valid Data Center license.\n\nIf you're using Atlassian Maven Plugin Suite (AMPS) to build your apps, remember to update its test data with a valid Data Center license to keep your apps compatible with Jira.\n\nEarlier EAP releases\n\nCheck out our earlier EAP releases for the supported Jira versions.\n\nJira platform version 10.x\n\nApplicationDateReferenceJira Software 10.0August 22, 2024Preparing for Jira 10\n\nChangelogJira Service Management 10.0\n\nJira platform version 9.x\n\nApplicationDateReferenceJira Software 9.17June 26, 2024ChangelogJira Service Management 5.17Jira Software 9.16May 6, 2024ChangelogJira Service Management 5.16Jira Software 9.15Mar 21, 2024ChangelogJira Service Management 5.15Jira Software 9.14Jan 31, 2024ChangelogJira Service Management 5.14Jira Software 9.13Nov 30, 2023ChangelogJira Service Management 5.13Jira Core/Software 9.12Oct 26, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.12Jira Service Management 5.12Jira Core/Software 9.11Aug 29, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.11Jira Service Management 5.11Jira Core/Software 9.10Jul 07, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.10Jira Service Management 5.10Jira Core/Software 9.9May 30, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.9Jira Service Management 5.9Jira Core/Software 9.8April 15, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.8Jira Service Management 5.8Jira Core/Software 9.7Mar 08, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.7Jira Service Management 5.7Jira Core/Software 9.6Jan 17, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.6Jira Service Management 5.6Jira Core/Software 9.5Dec 02, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.5Jira Service Management 5.5Jira Core/Software 9.4Oct 26, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.4Jira Service Management 5.4Jira Core/Software 9.3Sep 15, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.3Jira Service Management 5.3Jira Core/Software 9.2Aug 18, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.2Jira Service Management 5.2Jira Core/Software 9.1Jul 08, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.1Jira Service Management 5.1Jira Core/Software 9.0Jun 15, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.0Jira Service Management 5.0",

      "# [How can Atlassian get better at communicating with developers? by scott.dudley, ernst.stefan on 2024-06-06](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/how-can-atlassian-get-better-at-communicating-with-developers/80645)\n@remie,\n\nIn Introducing the new Developer ID to Marketplace - #8 by remie , you explain the history, as you see it, of Atlassian’s developer comms and why it is currently a problem. I’m going to set aside some of the controversial and confrontational claims. I read that as frustration and confusion. And not just yours but across the developer community. While understanding those sentiments, I can read a core criticism that is well worth discussing:\n\nI acknowledge that we do have cases where comms aren’t consistently published to the Developer changelog, which is the Atlassian standard for developer comms of this sort. This case was not one of those.\n\nIs it unclear that changelog should be the “source of truth” for changes? Do you want Atlassian to focus more on enforcing the changelog as the single “where to post”? Or is there some other problem with changelogs?\n\nOf course, the “where” is separate from “vital information” that partners might miss. Here again, I don’t fully understand how this example prompts the critique. Not only was there a changelog item, but it directly links to this thread so that you can ask questions and get more answers. Atlassians are just people so we don’t always get communication perfect in 1 pass. Hence, the need for multiple channels (changelog as authority, and CDAC as Q&A) to fill the gaps.\n\nWas it a matter of timing? (By the time I looked, both were available, but the CDAC post must have come first so the changelog could have a link.) Broadly, what do you suggest we do? What guidance would you provide to changelog entry authors so they can get more vital information into the first draft? Before getting wrapped up in the accountability of quality, could you help us better understand “what does good enough look like”?\n\nFundamentally, I acknowledge that we can and should be better at comms. But I disagree that the problem is that comms is “stuck in limbo” or that the solution is as simple as “if only there were a central owner”. I’m here, I’m listening, and I can get improvements made to the tools and practices. What improvement should we make next?\n\nOk, given that it is 11.30pm and I should really just go to bed let me start by saying that I will give more detailed feedback tomorrow. More specifically, because this also involves looking up a lot of old threads. Because we’ve had this discussion before, right here on CDAC.\n\nThe problem starts with the fact that no, the change log isn’t the source of truth. The change log is mostly after the fact (the change already occurred), only has little room for details and is scattered all over the place (every product has their own change log). Not all of them are easy to find and sometimes there are changes that impact multiple products that aren’t shared everywhere.\n\nApart from the change log, we also have CAC, CDAC, Partner portal. There are a lot of changes that impact marketplace partners that are actually posted on CAC.\n\nThen there is the partner portal, which ranges from solution partner / marketing content to technical content. Finding something there is almost impossible, especially because Atlassian often makes pages private for drafts and then changes permissions once it is ready, forgetting the crucial fact that Confluence does not sent “new”/“update” notifications.\n\nThen there is this weird state that many long-running product changes have, where content is both in CDAC, DAC, change logs and Jira tickets (see Platform 7).\n\nOh and there is of course CDAC.\n\nThe problem is that there is no single source of truth. No curated list. No place where marketplace partners can go to get all things Atlassian.\n\nI strongly disagree with this sentiment, because Atlassian was actually really good at this. But it requires a lot of time and effort. It means that product managers understand that changes to the product will impact marketplace partners (meaning that they should not just post on CAC), which used to be the case but has been slipping. And to some extend, for better or for worse, when everyone at Atlassian knew “post on CDAC” was the way to communicate, at least really did have a single source of truth. And Atlassian’s didn’t have to wonder where to post what.\n\nAnd again, I will look up the receipts tomorrow, but this has been told over and over and over again. That the danger of the decentralised strategy was that Atlassian would no longer understand where to put what herself and that with the lack of a centralised curated overview and dedicated internal education about how and when to involve partners crucial information would get lost in the void.\n\nAt some point, we got a half-hearted promise that Atlassian would look into building some sort of tool for a centralised overview, but that never happened. So now we’re stuck to the point in which partners have an unofficial Slack workspace in which we have a community effort to post relevant changes from all different sources to keep each other in the loop. But even then, we still miss out.\n\nSo yeah, from a partner perspective, the comms strategy is a mess. Decentralisation can be a good thing (use the right channel for each different type of comms), but it only works if Atlassian makes sure that her comms reaches the intended audience.\n\nThere are also the RFCs, some of them which are just effectively release notes. The format seems convoluted to start a discussion, but it was a good idea at the beginning.\n\nThe Partner Portal is a problem. The actual news (or processes) are diluted in thousands of pages. I’d be curious what the analytics say about the contents. Sometimes writing more doesn’t help. We have difficulty finding the process for each usecase, and my employees never go there for advice anymore, which is sad because there’s a lot of knowledge.\n\nBefore that, we had clear advice on the documentation website (I remember when the Marketplace launched, or when Data Center launched, it was just a few pages and the advice was high-density information) and we had CDAC for all news. There is also a big, big, big problem that Atlassian dropped the treeview on the documentation websites, which makes it impossible to browse sibling pages, let alone discover the hierarchy of content.\n\nThe Platform 7 communication will be studied for years: Probably 600 questions/bugs from vendors were answered on 25 different CDAC posts, but mainly as comments because every vendor knows posting a new question on CDAC will yield no answer from Atlassian. Huge work from Atlassian to answer all that, and yet, the information is scattered and unbrowseable for the rest of humanity because Atlassian’s developers don’t answer top-level questions on CDAC, and didn’t create a “platform7” category. What should really happen is a dictionary of all bugs we might face when making compatibility with C8.9 and C9.0, all sorted as questions, with one ticked answer like on StackOverflow.\n\nI see huge effort from a lot of Atlassian people in writing and communicating, sometimes with mistakes like posting an RFC when the project is already done and closed, but it’s true that “non-documentation” is the feeling that my dozen developer/marketing employees have, while I know that the information is somewhere out there.\n\nJust for info:\n\nWe synchronize some changelogs in our Slack, but for example we can’t know when Confluence 8.9 is published,\n\nBut Remie always seems to find more news when he posts them on the vendors’ Slack,\n\nWe don’t have CDAC feeds in our Slack, so one again information is scattered.\n\nThank you team!\n\nI agree with @remie on this.\n\nTake the release of a new version of Jira, I used to get notified by Atlassian on the date of release through a release notes watch, but for the last couple of years its been customers that ask for updated to the app to support there Jira version. I just haven’t found a source yet that will notify me without me having to go out and check every day.\n\nWhen I look at Jira Software release notes | Atlassian Support | Atlassian Documentation I’m greeted by this message:\n\nHowever, when I look at the Developer Changelog, where the information should be listed, I don’t see any notification related to the actual release, only EAPs\n\nIf the Developer Changelog is truly THE please to be, single source of truth for changes (and to me that includes actual release announcements) then why isn’t the last changelog for Jira 9.16 the actual release notes? Even if it is just a link.\n\nI really like the Developer Changelog, because I subscribe to specific changes that impact me in Slack, getting a nice notification that may require me to do stuff. It would be great if this really be the single source of truth its claimed to be, now it isn’t.\n\nThank you for posting this topic @ibuchanan. First of all, I second the points highlighted by @remie and @aragot. It’s dizzying to navigate between changelog, CAC, CDAC and the partner portal when there is no apparent policy for what will appear where.\n\nHere are some of my thoughts.\n\nThe platform 7 communication has been very hard to follow with a number of CDAC threads, even some changelog entries. Some threads have apparently died, and overlapping threads makes it really hard to follow where updated information will come. A platform 7 topic on CDAC with more high-level posts and less comments on scattered threads would probably be an improvement.\n\nI also feel that the communication would benefit from more openness on estimated date schedules, and coordination between the different teams. Continuing on the Platform 7 topic, it was very confusing for us that the different Data Center teams had such different communication strategies. The Confluence team has had an ongoing communication in a thread with incremental EAP releases. Jira was early communicating, but haven’t implemented platform 7, but it still felt good to have a thread and somewhere we could start asking questions. Meanwhile the Bitbucket and Bamboo teams didn’t make any sound. We could only assume that they were ages from being ready since no communications had been made yet. When they finally added CDAC posts, they have come with extremely short timelines for compatibility testing. They gave the impression of being oblivious to the amount of effort that’s required of the Marketplace partners for compatibility work. I would have loved to get more consistent timeline communications.\n\nA note on the RFC program. No RFC came for Two-Step verification for Data Center: Two-step verification login for Data Center - #25 by MateuszMiodek. It would have been natural to get an RFC of the concept before the EAP announcement, and our feedback and concerns would have been implemented into the first EAP. However, the team has been open to changes and quite transparent in their EAP communications, so kudos to them for that!\n\nOk, so here is my more detailled feedback.\n\nI’ll start by saying that ultimately, this discussion should not be about tooling. The problem space is much broader, and although it is tempting to distract the discussion from something as abstract as comms strategy to something a lot more tangible like tooling, the issue is hardly ever the tool.\n\nIn the end, partner communication has a clear goal: convey information about Atlassian to partners. However, achieving that goal is really difficult when dealing with so many moving parts. Because there is a lot of information to convey:\n\nChange logs for Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket and Bamboo for both Cloud and Data Center\n\nChange logs for Marketplace, Forge, Connect (incl. ACE & ACSB), security, DC approval\n\nMarketplace Program, marketing & legal announcements\n\nRfCs, EAPs and product announcements (some under NDA) for Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, Bamboo, Forge, Marketplace, security and Design System\n\nIncidents for Jira, Confluence, Bamboo, Bitbucket for both Cloud and Data Center\n\nProduct documentation for Jira, Confluence, Bamboo, Bitbucket for both Cloud and Data Center, as well as documentation for Forge and Connect (incl. ACE & ACSB)\n\nThat’s more than 60 different categories (when counted per product) and I’m probably missing some. And for each category, the comms are often owned by different teams and often these teams do not have dedicated resources for comms.\n\nEach of these categories have different requirements: for instance, a rolling change log makes sense for Cloud as changes can be released continuously, whilst Data Center products have strict versioned releases, for which release notes make more sense. Some categories require discussion and partner input, whereas others are more static. Some information should be persisted for future reference while other information is more fleeting.\n\nI think one of the more problematic assumptions of Atlassian has always been that partners should only subscribe to the channels that they are interested in: why would a Forge developer need to know about Connect? Or a Jira Data Center app about Confluence?\n\nThe problem with this assumption is that it lacks two things: cross-product thinking on Atlassian’ part and a fundamental understanding of the marketplace partner community within Atlassian.\n\nAtlassian has become less good in understanding that a change in product X will almost always have impact for partners in product Y. There are a lot of apps that integrate Jira and Confluence, and a change in the way Jira works can have serious impact on those apps in Confluence. Partners will almost always need to understand both Jira and Confluence.\n\nIn addition, a lot of partners have optimised their code for both Cloud & Data Center. Changes to Cloud that are not consistently ported to Data Center will impact partners.\n\nI’ve said it before, but Atlassian understanding of what it means to be a marketplace partner is very limited. This is also why some information never reaches Marketplace Partner communication channels, but is only shared on the end-user community forum (CAC) or even LinkedIn.\n\nSo instead of having a discussion about which tool is best for which type of communications, the real question is: how do we solve the problem of making sure that the information Atlassian wants to share actually reaches the target audience?\n\nBecause I think that is were most of the problems come from, and that is what I eluded to when I mentioned that the change in comms strategy got stopped in track: the change in tooling was implemented, but the communication strategy itself (who get’s access to what, when and where) was not fully rolled out and enforced within Atlassian.\n\nI know that I promised to bring the receipts, and I’m still open to doing that if there is a need for more concrete examples, but having slept on this over night I think we should really focus this discussion on the more abstract level:\n\nHow can we make sure that ~60 different categories of comms are streamlined within Atlassian and reach the intended target audience?\n\nThank you all for contributing so far.\n\nI started this thread because it was timely, but it is poorly timed, in the sense that I’m headed out for a week of vacation next week. Please don’t interpret my lack of replies as disinterest, I will study your responses when I’m back at my desk. I’ll drop a few points in response so far before I pause. Hopefully, that will help nudge responses toward what I need to make improvements.\n\nFirst, I would like to point out how many of you appealed to “partner needs”. While those needs are indeed critical, many of the problems you indicate are made even more difficult to solve when we must communicate to “all developers”. For example, the suggestion that Confluence would be a better solution falls down when we need to onboard every developer. The fact that we do have different audiences to manage will always create some fan-out of the solutions. Here, I would encourage the community to understand @remie ’s point about “this discussion should not be about tooling”. If you want specific features of changelogs, just drop suggestions into JAC/ECO tickets.\n\nSecond, the “fan out” that @remie describes is only going to get worse. There are only going to be more “extensibility surfaces” over time. As such, we are going to prioritize. As pointed out, changelog is a better fit for Cloud than Data Center. That’s an explicit prioritization decision. We are trying to build systems (both human and technical services) that can work across the entire ecosystem, but may have better or worse fit depending on the broader ecosystem priorities. Here, I would ask that you focus on not letting perfect be the enemy of good. That’s not an argument that things are good enough now; I’m just setting expectations that I won’t be working on improvements based on problems specific to Data Center.\n\nThird, I’m worried about aggregating the symptoms described here into 1 big problem of “Atlassian comms are broken”. While that’s the kind of appeal that tends to catch attention of my management chain, it fails to recognize quick, practical improvements that we could make to solve problems now. To that point, I accept another of @remie arguments that we need to make sure information is reaching the audience.\n\nI’ll crudely propose a solution (not tooling) that might improve how feedback on comms is perceived, processed, and prioritized by Atlassian (this first thought is not the RFC).\n\nIn an appeal to DORA metrics, I’ve been thinking about capturing “change failure”. While some change failures do result in incidents, I think the kinds of problems described here often don’t. So, we need a new signal to understand the impact and then to “multiplex” back to the originating teams. For example, signaling a “removed” API as “announcement” might be a change failure. Or an RFC that is merely release notes. Or, generally, any unanticipated problem that resulted from Atlassian making a change. There will be a need for tooling, but the overall point is that Atlassian current lacks the negative signal when comms aren’t reaching all of you.\n\nEven if you don’t agree with my points above, my ask is to try to think in constructive, targeted terms. I don’t want to be the cause of the next “in limbo promise”. I want real iterative and incremental changes that I can make in the next quarter, or year. That said, upon my return, I’ll do my best to interpret the feedback so far, and any that comes in over the next week for some solutions I can influence.\n\nThanks for your patience while I was on vacation. The thread seems to have settled down so it feels natural to conclude with my analysis.\n\nThe “meta problem” is treating “developer comms” as a single, well-understood problem when it is a “problem complex”. In other words, there are multiple problems, even if closely related. Each needs its own measurement, prioritization, and solution. When we have oversimplified as 1 problem, we have tangled ourselves into projects that are too big to finish in a timely fashion or that miss the mark.\n\nProblems\n\nTo help unpack the problem statements, I pointed AI at the thread so far. With some slight adjustments and my own sub-bullets to elaborate with my personal understanding of the problems. While the following problems are not necessarily occurring for every communication, these are so common that we can observe them repeatedly and frequently:\n\nInformation scattered across multiple channels and platforms.\n\nThis problem is often expressed as the lack of a solution: a single source of truth for communication. Despite our intent, changelog is not sufficiently authoritative.\n\nEven when changelog entries exist, the information developers need might be found in multiple unlinked sources like DAC, CDAC, or Partner Portal.\n\nDifficulty in finding relevant information for Marketplace partners\n\nWith Partner portal (and a set of related, Marketplace-focused channels) Marketplace partners have more channels to worry about, not less.\n\nInconsistencies in communication strategies and channels\n\nAcross different Atlassian teams, the information is provided through different channels and with varying levels of efficacy. Reality is so different from our model, that our developer community don’t realize we have a standard way.\n\nChallenges in understanding the impact of changes across different products\n\nStarting from the often obvious problem that we (Atlassian) don’t understand enough about the impact of the changes we’re making.\n\nLack of coordination and openness in estimated date schedules\n\nStarting from the often obvious problem that we (Atlassian) don’t have a clear sequence of events and schedule for those events.\n\nIssues with communication around major changes like Platform 7 and Confluence’s v2 REST API\n\nMajor changes often defy our internal model about how changes should happen. Esp for Platform 7 which “introduces” the new concept of “The DC Platform” which used to be implicitly handled in DC product-specific comms. We don’t have good ways to represent that concept across changelogs, DAC, CDAC, etc.\n\nBroken feedback loop between Atlassian and marketplace partners\n\nOn the surface, we (Atlassian) simply don’t listen. RFC comments say, “this is a problem.” We go ahead anyway without addressing the problems. And feedback provided on anything past RFC is often unrecognized.\n\nSlightly deeper, when developers (including partners) raise feedback about our comms, there’s nowhere for that feedback to land. The feedback “comms is a problem” is old, giving the impression that nobody at Atlassian is listening.\n\nNeed for better documentation and support for vendors\n\nEven if CDAC is intended to be a Q&A channel about “how to”, it often ends up revealing missing specifications (ie reference docs). This amplifies the feeling of scattered docs & inconsistent comms strategy.\n\nSupport cases similarly reveal unwritten specs, but without the benefit of making the new information public.\n\nFeeling of being left alone or behind in the communication process\n\nThe changelog is “point in time”, but the “supplemental” information in other channels grows with time. The changelog fails to bring developers along on this journey.\n\nSolution areas\n\nHere are some of the specific solution areas and the rough order of priorities we could work on to relieve the pain:\n\nChange failure: introduce the “failure” concept to amplify feedback. First as simple observations, then with consequences.\n\nChangelogs: strengthen as “single source of truth for communication”. Consider how to link through to more dynamic sources and better reflect growing understanding over time.\n\nReference documentation: focus on getting “revealed specs” into the authoritative reference docs. Increase discipline about communicating changes to reference docs in the changelog (ie “fixed” and “announced”).\n\nAtlassian self-service: improve guidance & tooling. Drive down variation and improve outcomes.\n\nAPI lifecycle: drive consistency with the overall flow. Publicly document the expected lifecycle because it’s not obvious through our actions. Enable the developer community to “call us out” when we fail to adhere to our standard (see change failure).\n\nInformation architecture (IA): reconcile IA of changelogs, DAC, CDAC, Partner portal, etc. Need to be able to better represent cross-cutting concerns like DC Platform 7.\n\nImpact assessment: integrate comms needs into the impact assessment process & tooling.\n\nRFC: improve guidance & tooling. Less perfunctory, more outcome oriented.\n\nPartner portal: clarify the role of partner comms and the relationship to “all dev comms” (changelogs, CDAC, DAC, etc)\n\nMy team will continue to own these items. To continue this conversation into these details, we’ll plan to publish RFCs on each of the above (maybe skipping some like “Atlassian self-service” which are internal facing) where we’ll elaborate solutions.",
      "# [Loading... on 2020-01-30](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/ACCESS-1468)\nThank you for your active participation and feedback following our announcement of product requests. We want to address some of the feedback we’ve heard and share our strategy for addressing shadow IT risks now and going forward.\n\nThe Cloud Enterprise (CE) plan solves the challenges of customers operating our products at a large scale by addressing their complexity, governance, advanced security, and compliance needs. The Atlassian Access product solves for more foundational security requirements and provides identity and access management support. We have implemented solutions for shadow IT risks based on customer differentiation in both CE and Atlassian Access.\n\nThe product requests feature will help our CE customers in large, complex environments more closely monitor shadow IT risks as they scale, bolstering our advanced security pillar of CE.

The first enhancement is scheduled for release this month and will introduce a new “last active date” field to APD.\n\nWith this enhancement, admins will be able to visit the ‘Discovered Products’ tab within Atlassian Administration and easily identify long inactive shadow IT instances and prioritize recently active ones to take action on.
