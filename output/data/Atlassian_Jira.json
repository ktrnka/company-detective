      "# [Microservices [What is it & Top Benefits]](https://www.atlassian.com/microservices)\nUntil about 2013, companies usually built enterprise software by constructing applications as single units with large codebases, a monolithic architecture. As software became more complex and cloud computing gained popularity, this approach became less practical.\n\nThe advent of software-as-a-service products (cloud-delivered applications) allowed companies to use providers, such as Amazon Web Services, to create new servers and add redundancy quickly. This ensured that services stayed online during upgrades. It also ushered in a new era of velocity and agility. Users began to expect quick upgrades and improvements, prompting companies to change their development processes.\n\nCompanies began to break applications into smaller, independent services or microservices. For example, instead of including a messaging inbox as part of a monolithic e-commerce platform, they might create a separate microservice for this functionality.\n\nIn parallel, developers started working in smaller, more specialized groups that modified and improved individual services without risk to the entire application. These groups often took responsibility for the operations of their code, as well — a model called DevOps. To facilitate these changes, project managers began to develop new methodologies, such as Agile, which divides projects into smaller, more frequent releases.\n\nRead on to learn more about the anatomy of microservices-based applications. Also, discover how Atlassian’s Compass reduces complexity while allowing developers to reap the benefits of this architectural model.\n\nMicroservices-based architecture has many benefits, but it also comes with challenges.\n\nOne challenge of microservices is that the independent services generate their logs. This is a disadvantage compared to monoliths' centralized logs, which provide a single source of truth for developers and operations teams. Monitoring and infrastructure management are also more complicated since many moving pieces exist. Testing and debugging are challenging because, unlike monoliths, no integrated development environment (IDE) exists.\n\nAtlassian's Compass can help with all these challenges. Compass facilitates collaboration and allows companies to manage the complexities of distributed architectures as they scale. It does this by bringing the disconnected information together in a central, searchable location.",

      "# [Learn Git - Tutorials, Workflows and Commands](https://www.atlassian.com/git)\nGit is a free and open-source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Unlike older centralized version control systems such as SVN and CVS, Git is distributed: every developer has the full history of their code repository locally. This makes the initial clone of the repository slower, but subsequent operations such as commit, blame, diff, merge, and log dramatically faster.\n\nGit also has excellent support for branching, merging, and rewriting repository history, which has led to many innovative and powerful workflows and tools. Pull requests are one such popular tool that allows teams to collaborate on Git branches and efficiently review each other's code. Git is the most widely used version control system in the world today and is considered the modern standard for software development.\n\nBranch\n\nDefinition: A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process discussed in Git Basics, the first module of this series. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.",

      "# [What is ITSM? A guide to IT service management](https://www.atlassian.com/itsm)\nAt Atlassian, the team comes first. We’ve even created a team playbook to provide tools that help teams improve how they work. IT teams should be continually learning and improving. They must feel valued and empowered to make a difference in the company.\n\nRather than adhering to rules imposed by tiered reporting structures or rigid processes, IT teams can make informed decisions about adopting SLAs and which software they should implement. Strong IT teams are pivotal in fostering productivity and driving digital transformation, making them indispensable for robust company performance. IT teams are the core of IT Service Management (ITSM) processes and technologies.\n\nAfter focusing on the strength of the IT team, it’s possible to develop unique practices and capabilities to provide value to the company. No matter how reputable the source, it’s insufficient to simply “copy and paste” another company’s set of standards, and hope they will work in your unique environment.\n\nSuccessful IT teams craft their approach by drawing from frameworks like ITIL (the Information Technology Infrastructure Library) and carefully adapting processes to align with the needs and preferences of their customers.\n\nFinally, software and technology should support a team’s practices and amplify their impact. The best ITSM software fosters cross-team collaboration, empowers end-users, and automates mundane or routine tasks—giving everyone more time to focus on what matters most. We've all seen instances where technology becomes a hindrance, introducing unnecessary complexity and frustration.\n\nWhen technology operates seamlessly, it may seem like magic, but in truth, it’s a reflection of the hard work of the teams that use it.\n\nWhat is an IT service?\n\nIn the context of ITSM, an IT service refers to delivering technology-related support and solutions to end-users or customers. This encompasses a wide range of workplace technologies, including laptops, servers, and business-critical software applications. ITSM teams handle requests and incidents related to these services through structured processes, ensuring service efficiency, reliability, and user satisfaction.\n\nWhat is an ITSM framework?\n\nFrameworks are tools that provide ITSM with standardized practices and procedures. Frameworks can provide a platform that monitors continuous improvement for service delivery and support.\n\nITSM is an IT service management framework that provides services for various IT functions. It defines operating procedures, techniques, and supporting services that deliver efficiency and value to an underlying system's operation. Frameworks help companies define their ITSM strategy.\n\nPopular ITSM frameworks\n\nIT teams use a variety of frameworks to guide their work. The two most common are ITSM and DevOps. Other concepts include COBIT, SIAM, IT4IT, lean, and more.\n\nBelow, we’ll cover two of the most influential frameworks for modern IT teams—ITSM and DevOps—along with a common approach to ITSM. Let’s start by defining some key terms:\n\nITSM\n\nAs mentioned above, IT Service Management is how IT teams manage the delivery of IT services to customers. How a team approaches ITSM can be structured to align with ITIL practices and influenced by DevOps concepts.\n\nITIL\n\nITIL is the most widely accepted approach to ITSM. ITIL focuses on practices for aligning IT services with business needs. ITIL can help companies adapt to ongoing transformation and scale.\n\nITIL 4, the recent update to ITIL standards, represents a paradigm shift for IT teams. It guides teams to a holistic, business, and customer-value frame of reference and encourages a more flexible approach based on how your team works. The ITIL 4 Guiding Principles promote collaboration, simplicity, and feedback.\n\nPeople sometimes misrepresent ITIL as “the rules” rather than guidance, but that's open to interpretation. Just because we need to use processes and document work doesn’t mean we should generate cumbersome masses of records and bureaucratic overhead. There is no excuse for hiding behind processes or the ITIL “rules.”\n\nDevOps\n\nDevOps emphasizes accelerated IT service delivery enabled by agile and lean practices. DevOps improves collaboration between software development and IT operations teams so companies can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably. Notable benefits include increased trust, faster software releases, quickly solving critical issues, and better managing unplanned work.\n\nThough DevOps includes continuous development, integration, and automated delivery, the concept is based on building a culture of collaboration between teams that historically functioned in relative siloes. Much of the context and ethos behind DevOps is about moving away from old divisions and working together. Unfortunately, people often see this pertaining to just ‘Dev’ and not ‘Ops.’\n\nPeople typically pitch ITSM and DevOps against each other as an ‘either/or’ decision – “we are an ITSM or a DevOps house.” There is confusion about what ITSM and DevOps deliver and how they could work together. Modern, high-performing teams realize they need to be able to work both smarter and quicker but still require process and control.\n\nIt’s time to move beyond the ITSM vs DevOps ultimatum and use elements of both—whether you explicitly follow frameworks or not. DevOps is much more than just automated development and promotes the importance of collaboration and a blame-free culture. Moreover, ITSM and the ITIL approach shouldn’t be pigeonholed as an administrative burden but used in an agile way to fit different companies' unique needs.\n\nWhy is ITSM important?\n\nITSM benefits your IT team, and service management principles can improve your entire company. ITSM leads to efficiency and productivity gains. A structured approach to service management also aligns IT with business goals, standardizing the delivery of services based on budgets, resources, and results. It reduces costs and risks and ultimately improves the customer experience.\n\nSome of the most common benefits of ITSM include:\n\nAligning IT teams with business priorities tracked through success metrics\n\nEnabling cross-team collaboration\n\nBringing IT teams and development teams together through streamlined project management approaches\n\nEmpowering IT teams to share knowledge and continuously improve\n\nImproving request coordination for more efficient service\n\nPromoting customer-centricity with self-service and better processes\n\nResponding more quickly to major incidents, and preventing future ones\n\nAll of which decrease costs and lead to better service, as well as enhanced employee and customer satisfaction.\n\nITSM processes and services\n\nITIL 4 recently shifted from recommending ITSM “processes” to introduce 34 ITSM “practices.” Their reasoning for this updated terminology is so that “elements such as culture, technology, information, and data management can be considered to get a holistic vision of the ways of working.” This comprehensive approach better reflects the realities of modern companies.\n\nHere, we won’t worry about the differences in terminology. What’s important, regardless of your team's framework, is that modern IT service teams use resources and follow repeatable procedures to deliver consistent, efficient service. In fact, leveraging practice or process is what distinguishes ITSM from IT.\n\nOutlined below are some of the core ITSM processes:\n\nService request management\n\nService request management is a repeatable procedure for handling a wide variety of customer service requests, including requests for access to applications, software enhancements, and hardware updates. The service request workstream often involves recurring requests and benefits greatly from enabling customers with knowledge and automating certain tasks.\n\nKnowledge management\n\nKnowledge management is the process of creating, sharing, using, and managing a company’s knowledge and information. It refers to a multidisciplinary approach to achieving company objectives by making the best use of knowledge.\n\nIT asset management\n\nIT asset management (also known as ITAM) ensures a company’s assets are accounted for, deployed, maintained, upgraded, and properly disposed of when the time comes. In short, it's the process of ensuring that valuable items, whether tangible or intangible, are being tracked and used correctly.\n\nIncident management\n\nIncident management is the process of responding to an unplanned event or service interruption and restoring the service to its operational state. Considering all the software services businesses rely on today, there are more potential failure points than ever, so this process must be ready to quickly respond to and resolve issues.\n\nProblem management\n\nProblem management is the process of identifying and managing the causes of incidents within an IT service. Problem management is not only about identifying and resolving incidents but also finding and understanding the underlying causes of an incident and identifying the best method for eliminating the root causes.\n\nChange management\n\nChange management ensures standard procedures are used for efficient and prompt handling of all IT infrastructure changes, whether rolling out new services, managing existing ones, or resolving problems in the code. Effective change management provides the context and visibility necessary to avoid bottlenecks and minimize risk.\n\nITSM software and tools\n\nITSM software enables IT teams to align with business needs and take a strategic approach to change, transformation, and growth. A wide variety of ITSM software tools are available in the market, from standalone applications to platform services.\n\nWe often hear IT teams complain that the traditional ITSM systems and tools they use are inflexible and, consequently, difficult to customize and adapt to evolving requirements. There also tend to be different tools for the various ITSM processes.\n\nModular tools create barriers, silo end users, and cause a lack of visibility across teams. Traditional ITSM tools are often difficult to deploy and manage, leaving end users to adopt tools that aren’t intuitive, which also leads to deficient or non-existent self-service ITSM capabilities.\n\nChoosing the right service desk software for your business is critical, as the service desk is the foundation of a robust ITSM solution. The service desk serves as the interface between customers and the IT team.\n\nITIL itself defines a service desk as “the single point of contact between the service provider and the users. A typical service desk manages incidents and service requests, and also handles communication with the users.”\n\nThe service desk should also play an important role in managing other ITSM practices. Consider whether your service desk and other ITSM tools meet the following requirements:\n\nEasy to use and set up: Comes with a clean, intuitive self-service portal that makes it easy to request help, search for knowledge, and track progress on issues.\n\nEnables collaboration: Provides a platform for developers and cross-functional teams to work together for faster issue resolution.\n\nAdapts to your needs: Is flexible enough to support any resolution, escalation, or change process your IT teams might dream up.\n\nThe choice of service desk software is pivotal, as it forms the foundation of a robust ITSM solution, serving as the interface between customers and the IT team. Jira Service Management stands out as a solution that addresses these challenges, offering an easy-to-use self-service portal, facilitating collaboration among teams, and providing the flexibility needed to support diverse IT resolution, escalation, and change processes.\n\nAccelerating value with collaborative ITSM strategies\n\nITSM stands at the center of modernizing companies. As the rise of software-powered services accelerates, IT service teams enable employees and teams across companies to deliver value more quickly. The role of the IT team has transformed from supporting the business to actively differentiating the business itself. It’s time to move toward approaches to ITSM that emphasize collaboration, ease of use, and faster value delivery.\n\nJira Service Management is a valuable platform for ITSM initiatives. It not only supports seven essential ITSM practices but also provides a comprehensive ITSM template. This template facilitates the implementation of key service management workflows, ensuring a quick and efficient start to ITSM processes. By seamlessly integrating with collaborative practices and emphasizing ease of use, Jira Service Management is a strategic tool for IT teams looking to enhance their ITSM strategies and drive value at an accelerated pace.",

For instance, they have a limit of automation rule RUNS, so you might get started organising work with certain automations and one day (without notice) you have to pay to keep doing your work.

I'm obviously not an Atlassian user--and I only have a vague idea of what this software is used for--so I apologize if my terminology is a little wonky. Earlier today, I discovered that my Gmail account was sharing data with atlassian.com. I never gave permission for any such data-sharing--nor do I work for a company that uses its products--but I do have an abusive ex-husband with a known history of hacking my online accounts. His sister works for a company that uses Atlassian software, and I'm fearful that my personal information (current address, phone number, etc) may have been compromised.\n\nSo, here are my questions: Is there an easy explanation for how/why my Gmail account would have been sending data to Atlassian without my knowledge/permission? Is data-sharing between the two companies standard practice or something?  If not, how could this software have been linked to my account?  (I apologize if these are silly questions...I am NOT tech savvy at all!)\n\nI've sent an email to Atlassian inquiring about the same topics, but I'm admittedly a little freaked out by the posibility that my ex might know where I am. I'm hoping that it's just my anxiety getting the best of me...and I'm also hoping that my fellow Redditors might put my mind at ease while I'm awaiting an answer from the 'official' source!

Best is to contact their support before its too late directly through support.atlassian.com.\n\nNext - Jira did not sign you for premium by itself. You probably clicked somewhere on “Try premium” button (theres lots of them lately..). Even if you get free Jira tier, there is monthly “billing date” set - its just free so they dont require you fill any info about billing address etc. Once you add any paid product to your roganization, it will start 14 - 30 day trial and ask you to fill billing info before your next “billing date”, otherwise they might forcibly downgrade your instance to free tier (if possible), or lock your instance entirely, if downgrade is not possible. Because you have just 1 user, you should be able to get back to Free tier without a problem. Btw. there is no way to pay for premium for example just for one month. You pay for what you use, but you can switch editions as much as you like. At the given “billing date” you will always be asked to pay for what is currently active. Nothing more and nothing less. I dont see anything predatory on this.\n\n### Comment ID lhn6gv7 with +1 score by [(throwaway_helpp123, Reddit, 2024-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/atlassian/comments/1eptlu3/jira_signed_me_up_for_autorenew_premium_without/lhn6gv7/) (in reply to ID lhmzqr7):\nI looked into it and realized that when i logged into Atlassian (it recognized my account and said welcome back so i thought i was logging in) it was actually making a new second product when i already had one free one. I did not click on any \"Try premium\" button, it automatically registered my second product as a premium one, probably because if you have more than one you have to start paying. I did not know this, nor did i mean to make this second product. It making all these assumptions for me is predatory, and i cannot delete the second product until the subscription runs out (September 10th) because it keeps saying \"there's an invoice associated with this account\".

Jira Product Discovery is one of the fastest growing products in Atlassian's history, one that we're investing a lot in, and it is definitely NOT going away - we've got big plans for the future! \n\nWe hope you'll forgive this faux pas (we're mortified 🥶) 🙏\n\n### Comment ID lla1u0q with +2 score by [(User-US808167184, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/1f7qeus/product_discovery_discontinued/lla1u0q/) (in reply to ID ll9y69p):\ngood... so then which app is JPD actually retiring? 😬\n\n#### Comment ID lla37iz with +5 score by [(Grouchy_Ad8857, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/1f7qeus/product_discovery_discontinued/lla37iz/) (in reply to ID lla1u0q):\nWe're retiring the **Beta plan** (which was already not supported anymore for months). The product exited beta and we launched the Free and Standard plans back in May 2023. This was the last cleanup step: telling customers who still have that Beta plan on their site that the product would get removed from their site (but they can still move to the Free or Standard plan).\n\n## Comment ID ll9d7dy with +12 score by [(JayyMei, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/1f7qeus/product_discovery_discontinued/ll9d7dy/) (in reply to ID 1f7qeus):\nAtlassian here. JPD isn’t being discontinued. This sounds like it’s related to a marketplace app and it is poorly worded. We have teams into looking into why this marketplace email is being sent out and by whom. Sorry for the confusion!\n\n## Comment ID ll95y70 with +2 score by [(rkeet, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/1f7qeus/product_discovery_discontinued/ll95y70/) (in reply to ID 1f7qeus):\nWasn't it going to be part of Jira itself (without \"Product Discovery\")?\n\nAnyhow, I haven't gotten that email (yet).\n\n### Comment ID ll9s9b8 with +1 score by [(BuddyIsMyHomie, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/1f7qeus/product_discovery_discontinued/ll9s9b8/) (in reply to ID ll95y70):\nThis would make most sense!\n\nAlso - woulda been really unfortunate for the (beta) Handbook authors, who just finished their “How to Use JPD” guide on Aug 14…\n\n## Comment ID ll9cu3o with +2 score by [(jschum2s, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/1f7qeus/product_discovery_discontinued/ll9cu3o/) (in reply to ID 1f7qeus):\nProduct Discovery definitely has not been discontinued. It’s one of the fastest growing products at Atlassian. \n\nDefinitely could be a phishing scam. So careful.\n\n## Comment ID ll96ejo with +1 score by [(benekuehn, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/1f7qeus/product_discovery_discontinued/ll96ejo/) (in reply to ID 1f7qeus):\nThat I don’t know, but I also cannot find anything online regarding this…\n\n## Comment ID ll9xx75 with +1 score by [(benekuehn, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/1f7qeus/product_discovery_discontinued/ll9xx75/) (in reply to ID 1f7qeus):\nIt was sent by „noreply@po.atlassian.net“ and contact us is linking to https://track.atlassian.com/tracking/e1c850eb-5e69-4eb7-b035-d3ac9ff10705\n\n## Comment ID ll99vbp with +1 score by [(Reasonable-Time5659, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/1f7qeus/product_discovery_discontinued/ll99vbp/) (in reply to ID 1f7qeus):\nSounds like spam. It’s not a marketplace app and is only available as a product within jira itself. If you look at the jira product discovery community there’s no mention of it there. In fact there’s a post from the lead pm (Tanguy) from the 14th talking about a handbook preview.

In my time there, I went through 2 re-orgs and 3 managers. It just always felt like being on a hamster wheel… in a hurricane. Today I received an email 7 weeks after I was laid off that started with, “ Congrats on your first year at Atlassian—we know that's a huge accomplishment and are beyond thrilled to be celebrating with you!” It was a bummer to receive that, to say the least, but it included a link to leave this Glassdoor review to “ help provide invaluable insight to future candidates and help us to improve your experience as an employee continually.” so here I am. My advice is to do proper change management of your automated emails when you layoff 5% of your workforce so that emails like this aren’t sent to hard working former employees that you eliminated congratulating them on a milestone they never reached. I know this wasn’t intentional, but it hurt.",

It’s truly an art form here. If you're not on a PIP, are you even really working? The company’s commitment to ensuring everyone feels the thrill of living on the edge is truly admirable. It's like a rite of passage—every month brings a fresh wave of anxiety and excitement. Who needs job security when you can have constant, gut-wrenching uncertainty?\n\nNow, about the PR count. Atlassian has managed to turn code reviews into a competitive sport. Forget about writing clean, functional code. It’s all about the numbers, baby! Your worth here is measured in pull requests like you’re a racehorse on a track. The more, the better, right? Never mind if the quality suffers—what’s important is hitting that next PR milestone. And, oh, the thrill of having your PR comments count scrutinized as if each one were a personal reflection of your professional worth!\n\nAnd let’s not forget the working environment. The long hours and relentless pace make it feel like you’re in a corporate version of The Hunger Games. Survival of the fittest becomes your daily mantra as you navigate through a battlefield of endless tasks and shifting priorities. It’s a test of endurance where every day feels like a quest to avoid the next corporate elimination.\n\nIn summary, if you’re looking for a job where you can feel perpetually on edge, where your every PR is tallied and analyzed, and where the work environment resembles a high-stakes survival game, Atlassian is your dream destination.",

This place can be mentally tough if you end up in a team that tracks everything—like PR counts and comment metrics etc. What’s labeled as ‘growth’ , feel more like moving goalposts and make people feeling bad about themselves.\n\nMany of my teammates are feeling stressed and hopeless in different ways. If you’re considering a job change for the money alone and already have a role you enjoy, take a moment to rethink. The job market isn’t great right now, so it might be better to explore side gigs instead of risking your main job and your mental health. I hope this helps!",

If a project led by an IC is slipping by a week, management make a big fuss about it and expect a mitigation plan ASAP. But, if the “leadership” is a few months late to provide an update we’re only told that “they’re working on it”. The same applies to the company's abrupt transition from extremely aggressive hiring to lay-offs within a two month period, there was no acknowledgement of potential errors that may have occurred. - In the past few months, the executives' tone of voice has shifted to somewhat passive-aggressive. Sure, it’s difficult macroeconomic conditions, but there’s better ways to communicate that we need to switch strategy. At least for the organisation that Atlassian was aspiring to be. - A lot of toxic positivity, especially from the middle managers. Every re-org is celebrated like it was the the best decision ever. It's especially annoying with more challenging announcements like purging the Development Manager role. - Your career and overall well-being are heavily dependent on your direct manager. If you're fortunate, you have the potential to advance significantly, but if you're unlucky, you'll experience a burnout. And too many good people have become miserable because of bad managers at Atlassian. It’s basically impossible to escalate a conflict with your manager.",

We didn’t just pay lip service to the values, we actually lived by them. The attitude was that staying true to our values would see us through good times and bad. Well, that didn’t last. When times got tough, the values were jettisoned and new people were brought in who’ve driven it further into the ground. Senior Meta and Amazon hires have been the worst thing for the company. People creating personal fiefdoms and just driving good people out. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, Atlassian always had problems, but they were more about a culture of shipping barely functional MVPs and moving on to the next thing. And the reorgs… It was like a dog spotting squirrels every five minutes. But it was worth it because the people were great and really tried to live the values. That’s gone now and there’s very little left to like.\n\nNew programs are rolled out and, when people inevitably complain about the tin-eared approach, the response is “trust us, bruh.”",

DS added new leaders in 2023 which I'm a fan of; new leader seems very pragmatic and results-oriented.\n\nVery little source of truth in company data.\n\nI also have found individuals able to go in-office more frequently are getting promotions, more interesting projects.\n\nManagers: I've had mostly good managers here. However, the bar changed (or I just got unlucky). Latest managers have lots of experience with big name FAANG / corps, but not good communicators, very vague, say one thing but then do another. They seem to be viewed as good managers only if they work around the clock and attend 100 meetings a week.\n\nCareer opportunities: promotions are hard, and 99% of the work is on the IC to put together their case. DS growth profiles haven't been updated in 4 years.\n\nLatest hires (including management) don't seem to be as aware of, nor celebrate, longstanding company values.",

Although they claim that PR count is just a signal, the reality is that if everyone is working harder and longer than normal, those working standard hours are at risk of being seen as underperforming. This may or may not be the management's goal, but it is the result of monitoring PR counts as a performance indicator.\n\nIt is toxic. Avoid it if you can.",

          "cons": "Atlassian used to be a great place to work, but management has deteriorated significantly, often seeming eager to find reasons to lay people off. After more than eight years with the company, it's disheartening to witness such a decline. The new rating system is unfair, downgrading employees despite their hard work. Unless you're working 25(yes 25)/7, you won't receive a decent rating, you aren't demonstrating much 'Org impact.'\n\nBeing a woman in tech is challenging, but being a mother in tech is even tougher. Despite the generous maternity leave policy, many new mothers, including myself, have received unfair poor performance reviews, leading many to leave the company. During my time here, I've experienced over three reorganizations and countless white male managers. When I finally had a manager who supported my goals for promotion, they were let go.\n\nWe’ve become worse than Meta, preaching admirable values but living in a 'Hunger Games' environment. At least with Meta, you know what to expect. The pressure to merge a certain number of PRs affects both performance evaluations and mental health. With everyone rushing to merge PRs, it's an incredibly stressful race—ironic for a company that preaches work-life balance. Asking for help in public channels often leads to management questioning your abilities; I’ve seen it happen repeatedly. Bringing concerns to HR feels like talking into the void. Lastly, We used to have free insurance, but now that benefit is going away. I used to love working here, but now I dread every day.",

With the redundancy of many managers most teams doubled or tripled their size, and some managers are now unable to focus on their direct reports' career growth. Also, there has been a deep focus on improving productivity in general (good in principle), which has led to impossible deadlines being set on projects (bad implementation). This has led to a poor evaluation when employees cannot meet the unrealistic goals set on them. These problems have been raised to leadership many times, but they insist that everything is fine (and everyone else living the problems day by day is mistaken). Lots of people have left or been invited to leave due to these new policies.",

It puts so much pressure on you to stand out above your peers and as a result creates a crab bucket mentality and causes so much stress over whether you are hitting each quantifiable metric.\n\n- Pay isn't overly fair and transparent. Some roles are considerably overpaid for the work involved and others are underpaid compared to what is expected of them, and there's no real pay transparency. Even within teams pay isn't often fairly distributed among team members.\n\n- Poor growth opportunities. Numerous \"growth paths\" are documented but actually achieving those is often near impossible and opportunities in other teams are very limited despite internal mobility processes.\n\n- Benefits &amp; culture moving towards just being \"industry standard\" rather than wanting to stand out as industry leaders. Lots of petty cost cutting (despite spending tens of millions of dollars on events like TEAM and RKO every year) has harmed staff moral further.",

In my time there, I went through 2 re-orgs and 3 managers. It just always felt like being on a hamster wheel… in a hurricane. Today I received an email 7 weeks after I was laid off that started with, “ Congrats on your first year at Atlassian—we know that's a huge accomplishment and are beyond thrilled to be celebrating with you!” It was a bummer to receive that, to say the least, but it included a link to leave this Glassdoor review to “ help provide invaluable insight to future candidates and help us to improve your experience as an employee continually.” so here I am. My advice is to do proper change management of your automated emails when you layoff 5% of your workforce so that emails like this aren’t sent to hard working former employees that you eliminated congratulating them on a milestone they never reached.

But, if the “leadership” is a few months late to provide an update we’re only told that “they’re working on it”. The same applies to the company's abrupt transition from extremely aggressive hiring to lay-offs within a two month period, there was no acknowledgement of potential errors that may have occurred. - In the past few months, the executives' tone of voice has shifted to somewhat passive-aggressive. Sure, it’s difficult macroeconomic conditions, but there’s better ways to communicate that we need to switch strategy. At least for the organisation that Atlassian was aspiring to be. - A lot of toxic positivity, especially from the middle managers. Every re-org is celebrated like it was the the best decision ever. It's especially annoying with more challenging announcements like purging the Development Manager role. - Your career and overall well-being are heavily dependent on your direct manager. If you're fortunate, you have the potential to advance significantly, but if you're unlucky, you'll experience a burnout. And too many good people have become miserable because of bad managers at Atlassian. It’s basically impossible to escalate a conflict with your manager.",

DS added new leaders in 2023 which I'm a fan of; new leader seems very pragmatic and results-oriented.\n\nVery little source of truth in company data.\n\nI also have found individuals able to go in-office more frequently are getting promotions, more interesting projects.\n\nManagers: I've had mostly good managers here. However, the bar changed (or I just got unlucky). Latest managers have lots of experience with big name FAANG / corps, but not good communicators, very vague, say one thing but then do another. They seem to be viewed as good managers only if they work around the clock and attend 100 meetings a week.\n\nCareer opportunities: promotions are hard, and 99% of the work is on the IC to put together their case.

After more than eight years with the company, it's disheartening to witness such a decline. The new rating system is unfair, downgrading employees despite their hard work. Unless you're working 25(yes 25)/7, you won't receive a decent rating, you aren't demonstrating much 'Org impact.'\n\nBeing a woman in tech is challenging, but being a mother in tech is even tougher. Despite the generous maternity leave policy, many new mothers, including myself, have received unfair poor performance reviews, leading many to leave the company. During my time here, I've experienced over three reorganizations and countless white male managers. When I finally had a manager who supported my goals for promotion, they were let go.\n\nWe’ve become worse than Meta, preaching admirable values but living in a 'Hunger Games' environment. At least with Meta, you know what to expect. The pressure to merge a certain number of PRs affects both performance evaluations and mental health. With everyone rushing to merge PRs, it's an incredibly stressful race—ironic for a company that preaches work-life balance. Asking for help in public channels often leads to management questioning your abilities; I’ve seen it happen repeatedly. Bringing concerns to HR feels like talking into the void.

      "# [The *new* Jira is here by Dave Meyer on 2024-10-11](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/the-new-jira)\nAt Team ‘24 in Las Vegas, we unveiled the next evolution of Jira – a shared place for every team to align on goals and priorities, track and collaborate on work, and get the insights they need to build something incredible, together.\n\nToday, we’re excited to announce new features (and a new look!) that make Jira easier, more flexible, and more powerful for all types of work – helping transform siloed companies into connected ones.\n\nLet’s take a look!\n\nMore flexibility, for more teams\n\nNo matter the team you’re on, Jira embraces the little things that make teams unique, while keeping you connected to the people, plans and information you need to deliver great work together.\n\nLet’s check out the new ways Jira is bringing more flexibility and customization to support any team’s work style.\n\nImproved navigation, customized for you\n\nSoon we’ll be rolling out a new, customizable navigation experience that brings the most relevant work to your fingertips. From goals, to plans, to projects, and more, a new sidebar gives you quick and easy access to the most important information from your team and across the company. Plus you can personalize it! Reorder items by importance, pin relevant work, and hide what you don’t need.\n\nAlong with the new sidebar, we’re also introducing a simplified top navigation that brings AI-powered search front and center. AI-powered search helps surface the most relevant information from across Jira, Confluence, and other Atlassian apps. That means less time wasted hunting things down, and more time to get s#!t done.\n\nWe think you’ll love this simplified navigation so much, we’re rolling it out across all Atlassian products for a consistent experience.\n\nMore pieces of flair\n\nWish Jira better reflected your team spirit? With new background colors, images, and card covers, now your team can truly make Jira feel like home. Personalize Jira to reflect your team vibes (we’re more of a cute dogs-in-hats kind of team).\n\nSpeaking of flair, we also added a confetti cannon to celebrate any time you move a work item to done.\n\nNo more issues\n\nNot every thing you work on is an issue (anymore). With more teams making Jira their home for work, we’re retiring ‘issues’ as our default name for work in Jira. Instead of referring to ‘issues,’ you choose how you refer to your work – whether that’s a “launch”, a “task” or even an “issue”.\n\nCustom project templates to scale your team’s way of working\n\nFor scaling enterprises, consistency is key. With custom project templates (one of Jira’s most requested features), soon you’ll be able to create reusable project templates for your organization with pre-configured workflows, automations, fields, permissions, and more. With custom project templates, it’s easy to scale processes you want to standardize – from marketing campaigns, to HR onboarding processes, and more.\n\nMaking AI work for Jira users\n\nAtlassian Intelligence (AI) in Jira empowers teams to be their best. Here are a few new AI-powered features in Jira that will enable teams to work smarter.\n\nSave time creating work items\n\nWith AI work creation, easily identify and create work in Jira right from a Confluence page. Just highlight the text and AI will suggest a task that you can create directly from the page. And soon, AI work creation will be even more powerful. You will be able to create single work items from Slack messages, or even use AI to scan an entire Confluence page for action items and bulk transform them into multiple work items.\n\nAutomatically create work items from Loom video\n\nMore of a visual communicator? With Loom AI workflows, you can easily turn any Loom recording into a work item in Jira. Simply record a Loom, click “create an issue,” and Loom AI will generate a detailed work item for your Jira project based on the video transcript. Now you can go from unstructured thought to structured work in seconds.\n\nBreak down work in a click\n\nWith Jira’s new work breakdown feature, AI helps you break down large projects into individual tasks automatically. Simply create a work item and AI will recommend relevant subtasks that you can approve in a click! Now you can spend less time breaking work down, and more time moving work forward.\n\nStay aligned every step of the way\n\nYour engineers, marketers, designers, and other teams may all work differently, but they should still be aligned to shared objectives. Bringing every team into Jira makes it easier for leaders to set goals, align teams to priorities, and track the success of every project in flight.\n\nGoals, everywhere\n\nPreviewed earlier this year and now generally available, Goals, which are being rolled out to all customers in the coming months (opt-in here), will soon be part of the Jira experience. To help keep your priorities front and center, Goals can be viewed in the list, timeline, calendar, and issue views. You can also now filter by Goals.\n\nThis one’s for you, program managers\n\nWe’re also introducing a new board view within Plans called the program board. This new, drag-and-drop interface allows you to coordinate a program of work and its dependencies across multiple teams on a customizable cadence.\n\nYour next great idea starts with Jira\n\nWe can’t wait for you to check out the new ways we’re making Jira easier, more powerful, and more flexible for every team’s working style.\n\nWith all teams on the same tool, and on the same page, building something incredible together has never been easier.",

So I was looking at what I think i s an esy solution, but it might be better ones - please tell if you know:\n\nAs not all customers are using the Portal (unfortunately), I want to email them all. Is that possible to do from JSM, as an agent?\n\nFor the ones using the Portal - I can use the Announcement Function, and add a link to an Article* with the news of the month.\n\n* A Jira SM knowledge Base Article; so they can be searchable for all customers.\n\nMy question; are there any other ways of communicating News to all customers/users in the Jira SM (and from Jira SM)?\n\nThanks In Advance!\n\nJaneLy",
      "# [Welcome to the next era of Jira by Dave Meyer on 2024-05-01](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/the-next-era-of-jira)\nHow did NASA land a rover on Mars? It all started with an ambitious idea, a great team, and Jira.\n\nJira helps teams do their best work and bring their ideas to life. And while good teams get the work done, great teams succeed over and over again. Which begs the question: what makes a great team? We believe great teams are built on a foundation of shared goals, coordinated work, and free-flowing information across functions.\n\nThat’s why the latest evolution of Jira offers a shared place for every team to align on goals and priorities, track and collaborate on work, and get the insights they need to build something incredible, together. We’ve taken the best of Jira Work Management and Jira Software to make a single project management tool ready to help any team go from good to great. And (throwback alert!) we’re calling it, simply, Jira.\n\nOne Jira, one invoice, and a billion ways to use it\n\nToday, there are over 1 billion knowledge workers looking for better ways to share and align on work. This means a greater reliance on tools to help teams work asynchronously across different geographies and time zones. With new collaboration and communication features built in, Jira puts cross-functional connectivity in front and center across everything teams do, from linked work to shared reporting. These new features include:\n\nGoal tracking to help teams stay focused and aligned\n\nAI-powered shortcuts that alleviate some classic pain points\n\nNew ways to visualize work and coordinate between teams\n\nRich integrations with Confluence and Loom to foster knowledge-sharing\n\nJira not only reinforces teamwork but also helps companies save money. Roblox saved $150k+ annually by consolidating from multiple tools to Jira, and saw a boost in collaboration and productivity – talk about a win-win.\n\nLet’s take a look at how Jira is helping siloed companies transform into connected ones.\n\nEvery team aligned to shared goals\n\nYour engineers, marketers, designers, and other teams may all work differently, but they should still be aligned to shared objectives. Bringing every team into the same Jira makes it easier for leaders to set goals, align teams to priorities, and track success across every project in flight.\n\nIn the next few months, we’ll be rolling out Goals in Jira. Users will be able to create goals in Jira’s list and issue views to visualize how each task maps to a higher objective. We’re also introducing new ways to easily view and track progress towards goals – a goals directory where every goal can be viewed and tracked, and goal progress charts in summary view where goals can be viewed in the context of your projects. With Goals, it’s never been easier to keep your teams aligned and understand how work is tracking against company-wide priorities.\n\nBreak work into bite-sized pieces with the help of Atlassian Intelligence (AI)\n\nAt the heart of teamwork lies the individual: when each team member is empowered to do their best, the entire team can achieve more. Starting soon, AI work breakdown (currently rolling out to Jira Premium and Enterprise users in beta) will make suggestions for breaking epics into issues, or issues into sub-tasks so you can spend less time breaking work down and more time moving it forward. Once you customize and approve the suggestion, your new work items will be created and nested in the proper hierarchy.\n\nA list view for every Jira project\n\nEach team prefers to visualize and organize work differently, according to their needs. That’s why we’re creating easier, faster, and more flexible ways to manage work for all teams – starting with bringing the list view to all projects.\n\nYou already know and love the board and timeline views. But if you live in spreadsheets (hello, marketing and operations teams!), you’ll feel right at home here, where in-line editing makes for an easy way to manage even the biggest backlogs. In addition to in-line edits, you can also make bulk edits in the list when multiple tickets need to be assigned to the same person or associated with a new goal. But the in-line fun doesn’t stop there. Need to create a new custom field? Configure and start using it right there in the list view.\n\nA successful launch requires tight coordination between developers, IT, marketing, sales, and support. That’s no small feat, but Jira makes it a little easier. Business projects can be viewed as a calendar with issues arranged by due date. Release dates from software projects can now be surfaced in corresponding business projects to help keep everyone aligned. (Note that calendars are coming to software projects in the next few months – stay tuned!)\n\nIncreased visibility for better decision-making\n\nTired of jumping between dozens of browser tabs to get a big-picture view of your project? Take heart. Plans (available in Jira Premium and Enterprise) let you combine issues from different boards, projects, and filters to create an all-encompassing view that spans multiple teams. Now everyone – from leaders to program managers to team members – can estimate release dates for cross-team projects, answer staffing and resource questions, or map out yearly goals, all in a single view.\n\nTransforming async collaboration with Confluence and Loom\n\nWith the explosion of distributed work over the last few years, fewer teams gather in the same room to brainstorm, plan, or make a decision. Thankfully, Jira’s integrations with Confluence and Loom make asynchronous collaboration just as effective as real-time teamwork.\n\nPicture a brainstorming session: you’ve already captured your ideas on a Confluence whiteboard and voted on your favorites. With a single click, you will soon be able to turn priorities into action by converting your top-voted ideas into Jira issues. You will also be able to convert the whiteboard into a Confluence page, and link to the issues you just generated.\n\nDistributed work has also prompted companies to use video to communicate in a more human way. Smart Links make it easy to embed rich Loom videos directly in Jira so teams can share critical updates, ideas, and decisions in the context of the work itself. Important information that once required a meeting or a written update can now be shared instantly across teams and timezones – without leaving Jira.\n\nStart connecting the dots with Jira today\n\nJira is more flexible, customizable, and powerful than ever. And it’s never been easier for teams – all teams – to work the way they want while managing projects, documentation, and knowledge cohesively in one place. We hope you enjoy these upgrades to your Jira experience – there’s much more to come!\n\nIf you currently have a Jira Software subscription, the new Jira is available to use today with no changes to pricing. If you currently have a Jira Work Management subscription, learn more about how these changes will take place.",

Learn more here.\n\nWhat counts as a Virtual Service Agent assisted conversation?\n\nAssisted conversations include:\n\nMatched conversations – any conversation that was matched to an intent, regardless of whether the Virtual Service Agent resolves the issue or escalates it to an agent for further support. Read more about how intent matching works.\n\nAI resolved conversations – any conversation during which the Virtual Service Agent responds to the customer using Atlassian Intelligence answers, and the customer indicates that the response resolved their issue or abandons the conversation, resulting in the conversation being auto-closed.",
      "# [Latest updates](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/index/)\nWe release new versions of our Jira Data Center products frequently. As a Jira developer, it's important that you're aware of the changes. The following resources will help you keep track of what's happening.\n\nAtlassian Developer Community\n\nMajor changes that affect Jira Data Center developers are posted in the Atlassian Developer Community, like announcing EAP releases, adding new Jira modules, or the deprecation of API endpoints. You'll also find handy tips and articles related to Jira development.\n\nCheck out our Atlassian Developer Community\n\nEarly Access Program\n\nAn Early Access Program (EAP) release is a public development release leading up to the official release of a Jira version. Development releases are a snapshot of our work in progress, primarily focused on allowing Jira users to see the new features in advance and provide us with some useful feedback. EAP releases can include changes like:\n\nChanges to our APIs\n\nDatabase changes\n\nChanges to Jira bundled apps and libraries\n\nChanges in our supported platforms\n\nDownload the latest Jira EAP release\n\nEAP releases include more mature Beta Release and Release Candidate (RC) but they generally don't introduce new changes. Instead, they provide bug fixes and tweaks to features introduced in earlier EAP releases.\n\nLatest EAP\n\nThe EAP releases give you an opportunity to test and fix your apps in advance of an official release. Refer to the following table to prepare for the latest Jira version.\n\nJira Software 10.1 and Jira Service Management 10.1\n\nJira Software 9.x/Jira Service Management 5.x\n\nStarting from 9.13 and 5.13, new Jira releases support only Data Center licenses. If you try to upgrade to the Data Center-only release with your Server license, Jira will fail to start, and you'll need to downgrade to the version you were on before the upgrade or provide a valid Data Center license.\n\nIf you're using Atlassian Maven Plugin Suite (AMPS) to build your apps, remember to update its test data with a valid Data Center license to keep your apps compatible with Jira.\n\nEarlier EAP releases\n\nCheck out our earlier EAP releases for the supported Jira versions.\n\nJira platform version 10.x\n\nApplicationDateReferenceJira Software 10.0August 22, 2024Preparing for Jira 10\n\nChangelogJira Service Management 10.0\n\nJira platform version 9.x\n\nApplicationDateReferenceJira Software 9.17June 26, 2024ChangelogJira Service Management 5.17Jira Software 9.16May 6, 2024ChangelogJira Service Management 5.16Jira Software 9.15Mar 21, 2024ChangelogJira Service Management 5.15Jira Software 9.14Jan 31, 2024ChangelogJira Service Management 5.14Jira Software 9.13Nov 30, 2023ChangelogJira Service Management 5.13Jira Core/Software 9.12Oct 26, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.12Jira Service Management 5.12Jira Core/Software 9.11Aug 29, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.11Jira Service Management 5.11Jira Core/Software 9.10Jul 07, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.10Jira Service Management 5.10Jira Core/Software 9.9May 30, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.9Jira Service Management 5.9Jira Core/Software 9.8April 15, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.8Jira Service Management 5.8Jira Core/Software 9.7Mar 08, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.7Jira Service Management 5.7Jira Core/Software 9.6Jan 17, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.6Jira Service Management 5.6Jira Core/Software 9.5Dec 02, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.5Jira Service Management 5.5Jira Core/Software 9.4Oct 26, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.4Jira Service Management 5.4Jira Core/Software 9.3Sep 15, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.3Jira Service Management 5.3Jira Core/Software 9.2Aug 18, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.2Jira Service Management 5.2Jira Core/Software 9.1Jul 08, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.1Jira Service Management 5.1Jira Core/Software 9.0Jun 15, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.0Jira Service Management 5.0",

      "# [Atlassian Jira now a hub for knowledge management, AI tools by Beth Pariseau, Adrian Bridgwater on 2024-05-01](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/news/366582968/Atlassian-Jira-now-a-hub-for-knowledge-management-AI-tools)\nA bevy of feature updates for Atlassian's cloud platform this week marked the culmination of years of integration work between its products and data sets, setting the stage for knowledge management workflows that go far beyond its roots in IT.\n\nA core group of four products -- Jira; Confluence; asynchronous video communications acquisition Loom; and Rovo, a new AI-assisted search and automation tool -- now form the \"teamwork foundation\" in the Atlassian cloud, according to execs during keynote presentations at this week's Team '24 conference.\n\nWhile Confluence, Loom and Rovo were positioned as equal pillars within the Atlassian cloud product line, Jira hogged the spotlight on the keynote stage Tuesday. It subsumed the formerly separate Jira Work Management product to become a unified but customizable work management portal that users can tailor for individual teams from marketing and finance to software development and incident management.\n\n\"We simply call it Jira, and it brings together the best parts of Jira Work Management and Jira Software into one project management [tool] to help teams pursue shared goals where they plan and track their work,\" Atlassian president Anu Bharadwaj said during a keynote presentation. \"Goals are now directly surfaced in Jira so every team has visibility on what they're working on -- from developers coding up the website to marketers planning their campaigns. … For any given work item, teams can see the goal that work is contributing to.\"\n\nJira appeared in nearly every keynote feature demo, most often in the form of the automatically opening and populating Jira tickets from other newly-integrated parts of the product portfolio. In other cases, the Jira product line added long-awaited integrations between existing Atlassian products, such as full Opsgenie integration into Jira Service Management six years after Atlassian's acquisition. Other long-discussed feature additions announced at Team included a Jira Align flow metrics database for value stream management within the Atlassian Analytics service.\n\nThese developments advanced Atlassian's competitive ambitions in enterprise service management (ESM) where it began encroaching on ServiceNow's turf four years ago, according to Julie Mohr, an analyst at Forrester Research.\n\n\"[Atlassian] is putting knowledge at the forefront. It's not 'we'll help you build a bot.' It's 'we're going to help you build better workflows. We're going to help your knowledge workers get to information more quickly,'\" Mohr said. \"From a strategy perspective, it's a very unique position in that market.\"\n\nIn some areas of ESM, Atlassian will never unseat ServiceNow from its dominant position, but it can carve out its own niche with a lighter-weight, more accessible set of products, Mohr said.\n\nUnified cloud search a welcome development for users\n\nAll of Atlassian's cloud products are now underpinned by a unified data lake and a knowledge graph, which Atlassian calls the teamwork graph, that automatically maps relationships between customer data objects, teams of workers and workflow actions. That data layer and teamwork graph then feed into analytics dashboards and automated workflows that will soon be performed by AI agents.\n\nBut first: an improvement in the quality of search results within Atlassian's existing portfolio, based on AI-assisted search with retrieval-augmented generation, an area where Atlassian officials acknowledged past versions of products left a lot to be desired.\n\n\"Over the last six months, we've made it 25% more likely that you'll find what you're looking for in the first position of search,\" said Jamil Valliani, vice president and head of product for AI at Atlassian -- a position he left Microsoft's search and AI team for in October -- in an interview with TechTarget Editorial. \"We've actually gone from being behind industry leaders in search in terms of [normalized discounted cumulative gain], which is a standard way of measuring search relevance in the industry, to over eight points ahead of … the industry leader.\"\n\nThese investments in search are a good sign, said Andy Rosequist, vice president of engineering at Sector Alarm Group, based in Oslo.\n\n\"Atlassian's search has long been a top complaint,\" he said. \"It's so hard to tell if the information doesn't exist in Jira or Confluence, or if the search is just bad.\"\n\nUnified search across different cloud products, along with new integrations, means time savings for cloud customers, according to one Atlassian Community Leader.\n\n\"The fact that we can now search across products and remove that context switching [between tools] is … something that Atlassian has always struggled with in some of their search [interfaces], especially from a Confluence perspective,\" said Dan Tombs, Atlassian architect at a satellite communications company. \"It's nice to see that this is getting some real attention. And with AI, the fact that you can just ask natural language questions is really, really cool.\"\n\nAtlassian Intelligence leads AI automation rollout\n\nThroughout Atlassian's cloud, generative AI put a new sheen on existing products, such as automated service desk generation within Jira Service Management for finance, legal and HR departments -- a significant expansion from past releases' preconfigured request templates. Atlassian officials previewed upcoming AIOps features for automated root cause analysis and incident resolution in Jira Service Management.\n\nOther features of Atlassian Intelligence, first previewed in April 2023, that were showcased at Team '24 included an AI-driven document editor for Confluence, Jira and Jira Service Management that ties in with Bitbucket to create pull-request summaries and release notes. Atlassian Intelligence can break large Jira projects down automatically into smaller components, and automatically generated issue summaries will become available soon. AI-generated API documentation will follow based on Atlassian's acquisition of Optic this week.\n\nTombs said his team already has Atlassian Intelligence turned on for all its cloud sites and has used it to write natural language queries that the tool translates into Atlassian's Jira Query Language (JQL).\n\n\"It alleviates some of my pressure because I don't have to necessarily be on hand to support them if they're not very familiar with [JQL],\" he said. \"It's already been used for Confluence, not only from summarizing large docs but helping to produce those docs.\"\n\nAI-generated references to issue context could be useful for incident responses, Rosequist said, but he expressed doubts about AI-generated Jira issues.\n\n\"A big weakness of GenAI is it sounds like something that a person would write, and there's already lots of confusing tickets in the world without AI writing them too,\" he said.\n\nTombs said he disagreed.\n\n\"Most teams are slammed; everything's really busy,\" he said. \"That whole idea of just giving AI tasks is the future? It's inevitable. This is just the next evolution of [automation].\"\n\nThat isn't to say AI automation is without its risks and drawbacks, Tombs said. For instance, the quality of the data AI draws on must be high to produce useful results, which means organizations often must clean up existing documentation before applying AI.\n\nIt's important for teams to truly understand their objectives before creating automation workflows, he said, which can involve low-tech approaches.\n\n\"I always recommend you start with 'what am I trying to do and how?' and then 'what am I trying to use?'\" he said. \"I know I'm not the only Community Leader that does this. I always recommend that when you are starting with automation, just start listing requirements on a piece of paper.\"\n\nKnowledge management takes shape with Rovo\n\nAtlassian's forthcoming Rovo product will apply its unified cloud search and Atlassian Intelligence automation features to customers' third-party SaaS tools through custom connectors. Rovo will create knowledge cards and organization-specific term definitions by pulling together disparate data sources on the fly, according to Atlassian co-founder and co-CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes during a keynote presentation.\n\n\"Rovo uses AI and the teamwork graph to understand any document, connect it, cross reference it deduplicate it and analyze its concepts, without you needing to do anything,\" Cannon-Brookes said. \"And as more documents are created, Rovo is always working. New statement of work written in a Word document stored in SharePoint? Rovo links the work and rewrites the definition. You list the target customers for [a project] in a Google Sheet that comes in from your sales team? Rovo links the work [and] updates the members of the team and the definition of the project.\"\n\nA Rovo Chat AI assistant will answer questions users ask based on the teamwork graph even if the answer isn't written down already, according to Cannon-Brookes.\n\nAtlassian is also anticipating common enterprise AI data privacy concerns by building Rovo with a private instance of OpenAI's GPT API that doesn't retain user data and refrains from LLM training that would mix data from multiple cloud tenants, according to Valliani.\n\nContext-aware search in Rovo demos looks good, said Andy Thurai, an analyst at Constellation Research. But for now, Rovo remains in private beta, and a work in progress.\n\n\"The chatbots allow for conversation [that draws from] any of the documents within Atlassian's realm, though it is currently limited only to structured data, with no specific plan or timeline for unstructured data,\" Thurai said.\n\nStructured data builds in an organizational schema; unstructured data does not. It will be important to support both to integrate with a broad array of third-party tools, Thurai said. An Atlassian spokesperson said this is on the roadmap for Rovo.\n\nFinally, Rovo will support AI agents, a form of bot-based workflow automation that some industry experts predict will be the next big trend in generative AI tools. Rovo will ship with more than 50 agents pre-built by Atlassian and its partners as well as allow users to custom-build their own agents using Atlassian Forge or a built-in no-code interface.\n\nRovo agents previewed at Team '24 keynotes included a Communications Crafter for marketing teams to ensure blogs and other external communications follow company policy as well as a social media scribe that links to Canva for image generation.\n\nAll of this might seem far removed from Atlassian's DevOps roots. But there are tiebacks to Jira in pre-built agents such as Backlog buddy, which organizes, consolidates and prioritizes Jira ticket backlogs, and Feature Flag Cleanup, which Atlassian's internal developer teams used to clean up more than 460 feature flags during the last six months, according to Cannon-Brookes.\n\nKnowledge management is also an important aspect of DevOps, Tombs added.\n\n\"You're trying to break down that original silo [between dev and ops] and make things faster and easier from project initialization all the way through to actual management and operations,\" he said. \"A huge part of the development of any product or any kind of service is the knowledge transfer from one team to another.\"\n\nBeth Pariseau, senior news writer for TechTarget Editorial, is an award-winning veteran of IT journalism covering DevOps.

It offers a wide range of resources to help you navigate the complex landscape of Data Center security effectively. These resources include configuring your instance, monitoring your product health, and managing vulnerabilities.\n\nWe’ve also released the Data Center security checklist and best practices for admins. This guide provides valuable insights on safely deploying and administering Atlassian self-managed software.\n\nWe value your input and actively encourage feedback. Share your comments on this Community post.\n\nUpgrade to Atlassian Data Center Platform 7\n\nJira 10.0 includes an upgrade to Atlassian Data Center Platform 7. This upgrade improves the quality of our response to security changes with reduced disruption and breaking changes for Atlassian Marketplace apps.\n\nAs part of the upgrade to Platform 7 and with the focus on enhanced security and performance, we’ve made the following updates:\n\nReduced the number of third-party libraries and improving dependency management\n\nUpgraded numerous Atlassian and third-party components to benefit from the latest security patches and bug fixes\n\nImproved the overall definition of the Java API\n\nImplemented the minimum required support for Java 17.\n\nPrepare for the upgrade to Platform 7\n\nTurn off the lights with dark theme\n\nIn this release, dark theme becomes partially available for the first time. Give it a try right now and enjoy the new experience for reduced eye strain, enhanced content readability, and visual harmony across work environments.\n\nThis feature is switched on by default with the Original theme selected. Additionally, the look and feel won’t apply color choices to both themesif your instance uses a custom header color, it will default to the light theme.\n\nTo change your theme, go to your Profile, then Theme, and select Light, Dark, or Match system.\n\nChanges and additions to APIs\n\nTo turn off the theming, disable the feature flag: com.atlassian.jira.theme.switcher\n\nUnsupported areas\n\nBecause this feature is a beta release, there are some areas that aren’t supported yet.\n\nJava 17 becomes the default\n\nJira 10.0 has been recompiled in JDK 17 with the Java 16 language level. This means that from now on you won’t be able to run Jira in lower Java versions (8 and 11).\n\nJira Software Data Center is migrated and fully exposes REST v2\n\nPlatform 7 and Jira 10.0 have rearchitected the Java APIs used to implement REST resources, which we’re calling REST v2.\n\nThese changes will only impact Marketplace partners who develop apps. The underlying libraries, Jackson and Jersey, have been upgraded to the latest versions. REST v2 also makes use of JAX-RS 2. Check out the REST v2 migration guide\n\nEnd of support for the H2 database engine\n\nIn Jira 10.0, we’ve removed support for the H2 database and the H2 library itself from Jira’s distribution. To resolve several security vulnerabilities, the JDBC driver for the H2 database engine won’t be bundled with Jira anymore. Additionally, you’ll no longer be able to evaluate Jira 10.0 using the H2 embedded database.\n\nWith the launch of Jira 9.0, we integrated Jira automation (formerly Automation for Jira) as part of Jira, offering you the convenience of upgrading either through Jira or the Universal Plugin Manager (UPM). To streamline and enhance your experience with Jira automation, we've made the decision to solely offer it as a bundled version starting from Jira 10.0. This is why, going forward, we’ll communicate all Jira automation updates in the Jira release notes.\n\nThis means that no future Jira automation versions will be available on the Atlassian Marketplace but we’ll continue to support the security of the existing versions. You'll still be able to access new features and improvements by simply upgrading Jira.\n\nAs of Jira 10.0, the bundled version of Jira automation has been updated to align with the changes introduced in this release, including the migration to REST v2.\n\nVelocity template and allowlist security improvements\n\nWe're making steps towards verifiably secure installation directories for all Data Center products. These changes not only increase the difficulty for an attacker to exploit filesystem access but also allow customers to verify the state of the product installation.\n\nStarting from Jira 10.0, all Velocity files stored on the filesystem (for example, shared, local home, or any other) will need to be explicitly allowlisted and must be of a specific file type. Files stored inside .jar files and bundled within plugins won't be affected.\n\nIn addition, all method invocations within a Velocity template must be explicitly allowlisted. For more information, visit Configuring the Velocity method allowlist and Configuring the Velocity file and file type allowlist.\n\nNew default endpoint security annotations\n\nWe’re introducing a new set of annotations for Webwork actions, servlets, REST endpoints, and filters to improve endpoint security by giving you better control over access to endpoints. These annotations have been revised to ensure that only the intended users access your application endpoints.\n\nStarting from Jira 10.0, when no annotation is specified, only licensed users will be able to access resources. To change this, annotate all endpoints that require lower security clearance level. You can also annotate all admin and system admin endpoints to provide tighter security measures.\n\nSecurity monitoring and alerts\n\nAdmins can now promptly identify and address critical security threats. This feature helps monitor and detect suspicious activities, such as modifications to important configurations or changing access rights.\n\nWhen the system identifies a threat, admins receive email alerts. These alerts contain suggested actions to investigate and address any possible security threats effectively.\n\nAuthorized users can use this feature to view, search, and categorize alerts. Upon viewing an alert, a detailed chart depicting the user's historical activities is displayed. This functionality empowers security team members to acquire valuable insights into the user's past actions.\n\nEnabling attachment storage in Amazon S3 without a feature flag\n\nS3 object storage offers an enhanced enterprise experience compared to the Network File System (NFS), especially for customers with large or growing data storage needs. Learn more about configuring Amazon S3 object storage\n\nIn Jira 9.11, we introduced the possibility of configuring a custom storage methodAmazon S3 (Simple Storage Service). This feature was available behind the feature flag com.atlassian.jira.attachments.storage.configurable.\n\nStarting from Jira 10.0, this behavior is available without a feature flag as all incompatible APIs have been removed. Learn how to store attachments in Amazon S3\n\nDeprecating MD5 in workflow layouts\n\nWe're removing the usage of the MD5 hash from Jira Data Center when reading/writing a workflow layout. As a result, we’ll no longer create the layout.json file when using Export as a workflow for new imported workflows from the Atlassian Marketplace. We’ll continue creating the layout.v2.json file.\n\nWe’ve implemented upgrade tasks to convert existing workflow layouts from MD5 to the more secure SHA256 hashing function. The upgrade tasks will be run during the upgrade to Jira 10.0.\n\nAlmost out of user licenses? Get an early alert\n\nKeep track of your Jira Software and Jira Service Management license seats with our new health check alert. It warns you as you approach your limit, giving you time to either upgrade your license or manage your user count. Additionally, you can customize this alert to notify you about a set number or percentage of available seats. By default, this is set to 10%. Explore how to set up a health check for Jira license limit notifications\n\nBefore you upgrade to Jira 10.0\n\nCheck the compatibility of your Marketplace apps\n\nAs a major release, Jira 10.0 introduces backward-incompatible changes to the apps' API. If you build custom in-house apps, you need to test their compatibility and update them.\n\nIf you have installed apps from the Atlassian marketplace or another source, you also need to check their compatibility and update them before performing the upgrade. To check app compatibility, visit Checking app compatibility with application updates or the Atlassian Marketplace to see if your app hosting is compatible with your product version.\n\nResolved issues\n\nSee the full list of the issues we’ve resolved throughout the lifecycle of Jira Software 10.0.",

      "# [Atlassian prepares to abandon on-prem server products](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37897351)\n>I brought Confluence into our org almost a decade ago — it was the best collaborative wiki tool at the time\n\nI respectfully disagree with that assertion! I remember 2012 (okay, 11 years ago). I had just joined a new team at work, and the documentation for the team was a lot of vendor PDFs and some .txt files from the lead stored on a network drive.\n\nThe company was just implementing Confluence, but it was slow on client and server side with no HA. That is the fault of the server team, not Atlassian, but still the software was ick.\n\nI spun up a shadow-IT Dokuwiki server that was much easier to use for a small team with text-based documentation needs. It had a naive \"calendar\" plugin that allowed the quick creation of pages based on date, which we used for oncall hand-off. Backup was zipping the data folder on the server.\n\nIt was probably 3 more years until our hand was forced to use the \"enterprise standard\" for business continuity purposes.\n\nThere is no perfect issue tracking system sadly and integration with prs and commits actually is becoming a hard requirement for me. This is not something that people should be updating to an issue tracker manually, ever. Or doing without entirely (more common). Also nice in Github is the integration with Github actions and being able to see whether something can be merged safely or not.\n\nI double as a product manager and CTO, meaning I do both code and planning. We're using Github issues and Asana. Both have their strengths and weaknesses. I'd take both over Jira any day. And since I'm in charge, my company is blissfully free of anything Atlassian.\n\nI kind of like Asana for planning. It's got a few sane features one of which is separating issues from projects. This allows me to quickly plan out projects and then add tickets to the relevant team boards. And another one is making it very easy to create issues in a spreadsheet like view that minimizes the click bureaucracy other tools have. Great when you basically are thinking at the bullet point level and just want to hit enter instead of having to fiddle with obnoxious modal forms.\n\nOf course for developers Asana isn't great because it has no markdown support and no usable github integration (a few commercial things exist but they are basically glorified sync tools). Github issues have a few nice features as well. I like working with check lists and then converting the individual items to tasks. That comes close to how I like to use Asana.\n\nWhere Github falls off a cliff is what passes for project management. I don't know what their PMs were smoking but it's just completely wrong and useless. It kind of lives orthogonal to issues (!!!!!) and nothing syncs automatically except with really awkward github actions crap. So, it only serves to add a lot of bureaucracy and busy work without actually addressing the core problem. A combination of over engineered and inadequate.\n\nThe core issue with Github is that issues are tied to a single code repository. From a planning point of view that is just horrible because I manage a product consisting of multiple code repositories and I need one plan that may involve zero or more code repositories and not several and I don't want to lock in my issues to a single repository before I have even figured out what the plan is. I guess that's what they tried to fix with their project management thingy. Except they messed that up badly.\n\nI'd love a tool that is a bit like Asana but more integrated with pull requests, CI/CD, the notion of work being distributed across multiple code repositories, teams, etc. I don't mean yet another sync thingy that copies tickets from system X to system Y. I would like a one stop shop that can be used throughout the life cycle of a software product from before any code is written until users / customers start reporting issues and everything in between. Doesn't exist.\n\nMicrosoft's \"on the record\" voice is always \"Azure DevOps is alive and has an active roadmap\".\n\nYou can read that roadmap for yourself. It is kept in a GitHub repository. Last time I checked this year the last commit was sometime in 2020. The last group of features that loudly launched for Azure DevOps were branded \"GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps\". (This is where I get the 2-3 years behind GitHub metric.) Microsoft's actions seem to be speaking a lot louder than their \"on the record\" words.\n\nI've heard from multiple \"off the record\" sources who are entirely hearsay and I cannot name names that \"Yes, of course Azure DevOps is dead.\"\n\nThe best, I can say, as mostly an outsider is that Azure DevOps is at least \"undead\" and definitely in some sort of zombie state. I've got an unsubstantiated feeling, again as mostly an outsider, that Microsoft is somehow superstitious about Azure DevOps' home office (Microsoft office in North Carolina was founded out of Microsoft's source control dreams) and is afraid to kill it.\n\nYeah, GitHub Projects/Issues have picked up a lot of \"features\" that only a (Microsoft) PM could love. Many of them don't even light up unless you are in a paid organization (or GitHub Enterprise) (not just a paid account, but a paid organization) so probably a lot of GitHub users probably don't even realize how much GitHub now has feature \"parity\" with Jira or AzDO. (Nor how quickly that has happened.)\n\nI'm mostly aware of it from GitHub Universe and Microsoft BUILD demonstration videos. Both of which give me a lot of signals that Microsoft internally has moved a lot faster to GitHub than it did from predecessors to TFS/TFS+git. Some of the teams talking about it are huge ones (both in terms of size but also in terms of weight internal/external to the company).\n\nFrom their own hype videos in the virtual sides of the two conferences, I certainly get the impression they reached \"good enough\" feature \"parity\" with AzDO Work Items internally a year or two ago, at least. That doesn't seem like the reason they keep saying AzDO is still alive.\n\nI do realize that AzDO has some big enough Enterprise customers though that not spooking them can be a big reason for the weird messaging despite their overt actions and all the subtle hints that AzDO is dead. But also, my understanding is that many of those customers don't entirely care if a migration needs to happen so long as they are given a migration with a far enough out deadline. [1] I know some companies seem to be acting more spooked that there isn't a deadline yet for AzDO's shutdown. (It was a factor in my last employer migrating to Atlassian's terrible products for everything but repository hosting after years in AzDO [after years in Bitbucket and Atlassian's terrible products and hating them; vicious cycle].)\n\nI obviously don't know what Microsoft is truly waiting for at this point to kill AzDO, which gets back to that feeling that it is something fundamentally weirder such as a superstition.\n\n[1] Case in point: no one seems to be shouting too much about the crazy Azure AD to Entra shenanigans because it has dates and timelines! The timelines don't even make sense: among other things, Azure AD B2B and Azure AD B2C both get marketed as \"deprecated\" months before their Entra counterparts are expected to leave \"Beta\" or \"Preview\" statuses and even more months before automated migration tools are expected to be available. But it is all a planned migration and that makes all the difference.\n\nCame here to say this as well.\n\nAll the talk about the office being a magnet, not a mandate... needs to apply to products as well. Magnets, not mandates.\n\nAtlassian hasn't added much in the way of new features to the cloud instances, and the cloud options often take a lot longer to return queries.\n\nAnd frankly, the \"migrations\" were never great... upgrading form some customized version of Atlassian (or just highly configured) to the cloud generally moved / changed things. Meh, sort of inevitable, but also really tedious. And don't get me started on how miserable \"half-migrations\" were where some teams moved and some didn't, or Jira moved but Confluence didn't. Those months in limbo with multiple logins and issues getting created in the wrong places were torture. Atlassian didn't really help customers with all this -- I was told they wouldn't even help us clone the Jira server so we could run migration tests... we had to do it live. (Something about Atlassian not offering another license without us paying for the test server as if it were a real server.)\n\nMoving off Atlassian seems like a good call!\n\nI pushed my org (at the time) to move to GitHub... we ran a test program, and it was successful, but I left the company before it was completed. I was so much happier with GitHub.\n\nReading this news makes me happy because I know someone somewhere is likely going to be have the chance to argue that it's time to migrate away from JIRA and Confluence.\n\nI personally they haveheld back nearly every organization I've worked for in some way or another over the last 15 years. These Atlassian products are the destroyers of enjoyment, satisfaction, project management and productivity.\n\nIssues I've encountered with Confluence and JIRA:\n\n* Painfully slow UI.\n\n* The confusing UX for JIRA.\n\n* The 100x ways to accomplish the same things in JIRA.\n\n* The fact project managers always end up going back to a spreadsheets because JIRA doesn't cut it, even though they insist they need to continue using it.\n\n* The way people bastardize every installation of JIRA it never seems to solve the problem it was designed to solve adequately, or because that was encouraged via \"plugins\".\n\n* JIRA can't be upgraded because someone installed a plugin that cannot be upgraded too, but the whole org is dependent on some functionality from said plugin.\n\n* The pathetic search in both product.\n\n* The shitty editor in confluence I really cannot believe anyone is still interested in using it.\n\n* Confluence not having support for Git or some similar version control system or pull-request like process support, making everyone to afraid to make changes to documentation.\n\n* Confluece, errors, just blows up sometimes when I go to save a document.\n\nI get that the plugins issues aren't entirely Atlassians fault in some ways ,but in others they are. I believe their plugin implementation allowed people to way too tightly integrate with the core product, not working like \"integrations\" but actually having the ability to break basic work flows. It was a huge mistake.\n\nI personally use GH issues and projects and the simplicity of it is really fantastic, when I'm forced to go back to JIRA at work, I just feel that I cannot believe I get paid to waste time wrangling these products into doing something useful.\n\nWe(as in everyone) are in a serious need of a new git server product. Just do git serving, and do it well. Preferably in a way multiple nodes can be run active-active for scaling and reliability. No need for cicd (Jenkins is fine for that, thank you very much).\n\nWhat are minimum viable features for me? Granular (per branch) security access. Integration with AD federation and other auth providers(congnito, aws iam) and ability to give AD groups rights.\n\nWeb hooks sending and receiving. For example launch a merge request webhook(to lambda via aws api gateway, or to Jenkins). Receive a webhook as merge request approval when some Jenkins job finishes.\n\nThere is exactly zero need for your repository system also run cicd jobs. It ends up doing both tasks badly.\n\nYou'd like an example of said badness? Ok, how about this: in gitlab enterprise if you create cicd jobs/pipelines there is no way to giving someone an ability to run that pipeline without giving that person ability to push to the repository and submit merge requests. Yes, you can then set it so approval is needed before merge, protecting said pipeline, but why? There has been a ticket on gitlabs own issues page about it for years and it is still not resolved.\n\nBut wait, there is more... Gitlab enterprise has no mode of working that let's you have more than one active server at a time so goodbye horizontal scaling.\n\nYou want to scale your cicd worker nodes? They want you to use docker mashine(a deprecated product) instead of writing a Plugin like ec2-fleet for Jenkins.\n\nIt is obvious gitlab tries to funnel it's enterprise customers into saas.\n\nThanks for your feedback. GitLab team member here.\n\n> We(as in everyone) are in a serious need of a new git server product. Just do git serving, and do it well. Preferably in a way multiple nodes can be run active-active for scaling and reliability. No need for cicd (Jenkins is fine for that, thank you very much).\n\nYou can integrate Jenkins into GitLab. https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jenkins.html Suggest considering a migration to GitLab CI/CD in your migration planning, following the updated documentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/migration/jenkins.html and more automated imports in https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/09/26/atlassian-server-en...\n\n> Web hooks sending and receiving. For example launch a merge request webhook(to lambda via aws api gateway, or to Jenkins). Receive a webhook as merge request approval when some Jenkins job finishes.\n\n(FYI) https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhook... and https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhook...\n\nYou can trigger a pipeline from external webhooks using a trigger token, and execute an action against the GitLab REST API. The example for triggering pipelines in https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/triggers/#trigger-a-pipeline can be expanded into more actions, i.e. using the API to create MR approvals or comments.\n\nFor Python, I'd recommend looking into python-gitlab and this tutorial blog post: https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/02/01/efficient-devsecops...\n\n> if you create cicd jobs/pipelines there is no way to giving someone an ability to run that pipeline without giving that person ability to push to the repository and submit merge requests. Yes, you can then set it so approval is needed before merge, protecting said pipeline, but why? There has been a ticket on gitlabs own issues page about it for years and it is still not resolved.\n\nPlease share the URL :)\n\nWhen creating a new GitLab project, the default branch is protected by default, and only maintainer roles can push to the default branch. https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.h...\n\nA developer role can create non-protected Git branches, merge requests, and as such trigger a pipeline from a merge request. You've mentioned approval rules as a safeguard already - CODEOWNERS can be an additional way to ensure that review workflows are followed. https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/codeowners/\n\nYou can also use branch protection rules to allow `No one` for push actions, i.e. any branch that matches the pattern, except for `main` or git tag patterns. https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.h...\n\n> Gitlab enterprise has no mode of working that let's you have more than one active server at a time so goodbye horizontal scaling.\n\nSuggest reviewing the reference architectures documentation in https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architec... to decide whether horizontal scaling is needed for your environment.\n\nFor distributed environments, suggest looking into Geo: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/index.html\n\n> You want to scale your cicd worker nodes? They want you to use docker mashine(a deprecated product) instead of writing a Plugin like ec2-fleet for Jenkins.\n\nThe current GitLab CI/CD runner architecture involves docker-machine, based on a fork maintained by GitLab. This fork receives security and bug fixes to ensure users and customers can rely on auto-scaling in production. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/docker-machine#%EF%B8%8F... Please review the support statement in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2502 to learn more for how long the fork remains supported.\n\nThe new auto-scaling architecture provides a task scheduler, and so-called fleeting plugins. You can review the architecture blueprint in https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/runner_sc... and follow the documentation in https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/runner_autoscale/\n\nIf you prefer a timeline, please follow the Docker Machine Replacement Project Plan in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6995 For example, the AWS EC2 Fleeting plugin is available in Beta since GitLab 16.5 and scheduled for 16.7 GA, see the epic https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8856\n\nWhen using Kubernetes, you can take advantage of the Kubernetes executor to auto-scale pods. https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/kubernetes.html\n\nTo optimize the CI/CD infrastructure next to auto-scaling, these tips might be handy, too: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/pipeline_efficiency....\n\n> into saas.\n\nNext to GitLab self-managed and SaaS, you can also use GitLab Dedicated, where you get access your own isolated cloud instance. https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/08/03/building-gitlab-wit...",
      "# [Atlassian combines Jira Software and Work Management tools by Frederic Lardinois on 2024-05-01](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/01/jira-software-and-jira-work-management-become-one/)\nAt its Team ’24 event in Las Vegas, Atlassian today announced that it is combining Jira Software with Jira Work Management into a single product under the “Jira” brand.\n\nThe origins of Jira, Atlassian’s flagship project management tool, are in software development and issue tracking for developers, but throughout the past few years, the company started to launch Jira versions for other teams as well. These included Jira Work Management for business teams like marketing, sales and human resources, which launched in 2021 and replaced a previous product called Jira Core.\n\n“We believe great teams are built on a foundation of shared goals, coordinated work, and free-flowing information across functions,” writes Dave Meyer, the head of product for Jira, in today’s announcement. “That’s why the latest evolution of Jira offers a shared place for every team to align on goals and priorities, track and collaborate on work, and get the insights they need to build something incredible, together. We’ve taken the best of Jira Work Management and Jira Software to make a single project management tool ready to help any team go from good to great.”\n\nThe idea here is to offer a cross-functional tool that allows different teams inside a company to more easily collaborate and track their work. While there were already connections between Jira Software and Jira Work Management (plus Work Management is already included in every Jira subscription for free), Atlassian says that this combined version will reduce friction and help different teams align on common goals, no matter whether they are engineers, marketers or designers, for example.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Jira Service Management for IT teams is not affected by this change.\n\nMore AI in Jira\n\nWith this change, Atlassian is also bringing a number of new features to Jira to enable this kind of collaboration. Unsurprisingly, these include several new AI-based tools.\n\nMaybe the most interesting of these is the new AI work breakdown (coming to Jira and Jira Premium users soon), which can help teams break down their epics into individual issues (or issues into sub-tasks) automatically — with the ability to edit them manually, too, of course. That takes away some of the grunt project management work and will free up project managers to focus on the bigger-picture items on their to-do lists.\n\nSoon, Jira will also be able to sum up issue comments automatically. This capability will also come to Confluence, Atlassian’s wiki-like workspace tool.\n\nCurrently, to become a Jira power user, you’ll need to learn the Jira Query Language (JQL) to search for issues on the platform. Now, thanks to the power of large language models, users will be able to use natural language to create these JQL queries.\n\nAnd for those occasions where you don’t know exactly what to write, Atlassian is also introducing a new generative AI writing tool to Jira that can create, summarize and improve descriptions and comments. These same capabilities are also coming to Atlassian’s Trello and Bitbucket, with Jira Product Discovery and Confluence following soon.\n\nSetting Goals\n\nSince the entire purpose of combining these two tools is to make collaboration easier, Jira is also getting a new feature that helps teams align on their overall goals. That feature, imaginatively dubbed “Goals,” will roll out in the coming month and aims to help users to “create goals in Jira’s list and issue views to visualize how each task maps to a higher objective.” There will also be a directory of goals and goal progress charts “where goals can be viewed in the context of your projects.”\n\nNew views\n\nJira is also introducing a few new ways to work with issues and visualize them. You can now see every project in a spreadsheet-like list view, for example, and make in-line edits. Atlassian notes that this will also make bulk edits easier.\n\nTo better track complex projects, Jira Premium and Enterprise users now get access to the new “Plans” feature, which allows users to track issues from different boards and projects in a single view.\n\n“Now everyone – from leaders to program managers to team members – can estimate release dates for cross-team projects, answer staffing and resource questions, or map out yearly goals, all in a single view,” Meyer explains in today’s announcement.\n\nSpeaking of time, there is now also a new calendar view for tracking business projects with issues organized by due date. This, Meyer notes, will help business teams more easily align their work in sync with upcoming software releases. The full launch of this calendar feature is still a few months out, though.",
      "# [Atlassian Team '24: the Jira news from Las Vegas](https://www.jodocus.io/en/post/atlassian-team24-jira-news)\nThis year, Atlassian shared some exciting news at Team '24 in Las Vegas. Besides Atlassian Intelligence, all eyes are on Jira, with Atlassian announcing two interesting and long-awaited updates.\n\nMerger of Jira Work Management and Jira Software into Jira\n\nThis announcement was likely one of the major highlights at Atlassian Team '24: Jira Work Management and Jira Software will be merged into a single productâJira. The goal is to create a single, unified project management tool that efficiently supports both software and business teams.\n\nThis shift brings multiple benefits to teams. Now, they only need to work within a single tool that consolidates all their tasks and information. At the same time, managing multiple products becomes significantly easier. Tasks like billing, provisioning, and permissions become simpler and more streamlined.\n\nNew features\n\nThe merging of Jira Work Management and Jira Software brings not only advantages but also new features:\n\nGoals: Jira users can now create goals directly in Jira and link them to projects or tasks. This provides teams with a better overview of their objectives and the associated tasks. Users can also view a list of all company goals and the teams involved in the \"Goals Directory,\" ensuring everyone stays on track.\n\nPlans: The best features from Jira Work Management are now available in Jira Plans (formerly Advanced Roadmaps). New overviews offer a calendar view, an updated summary view for quick metric insights, and a user-friendly interface that makes it easier to create and navigate plans.\n\nList View: The List View, previously exclusive to Jira Work Management, is now available in any Jira project, including software projects. It allows for editing task information in a table-like format without having to click into each individual task.\n\nAtlassian Intelligence: Another exciting feature is Â AI work Â breakdown. This functionality (currently in beta mode for Premium and Enterprise users) suggests ways to split epics into issues or issues into sub-issues, making work organization much simpler. Once customized and approved, Atlassian Intelligence creates the new work items and sorts them into the correct hierarchy.\n\nWhat does this mean for Jira users?\n\nStarting May 1, 2024, Jira Work Management will no longer be available for standalone purchase. Existing customers with a Jira Work Management subscription can continue to use it until early 2025, after which it will be automatically transitioned to the new Jira version.\n\nThis transition will not affect existing projects, and there will be no pricing changes. Atlassian is also offering an automatic 10% discount on the new Jira subscription for 12 months after the migration.\n\nFor Jira Software users, nothing changes initially. The new features and user interface will be added automatically, without affecting existing projects or plans. Speaking of the new user interface...\n\nJira is getting a new UI\n\nAnother major announcement at Team '24 is the completely redesigned UI for Jira. The new navigation aims to improve usability and create a consistent experience across all Atlassian products, making Jira even more intuitive and efficient. Here are some of the key changes:"
