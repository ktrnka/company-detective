As a result, you may want to trial the navigation changes and assess how your apps will adapt to the proposed changes.\n\nTo participate in the upcoming Early Access Program (EAP), please provide your Jira/JSM test instance details via the EAP waitlist form. This will give access to the EAP version of the new look of Jira and JSM. We will notify you about your enrollment once the EAP launches on October 14, 2024.\n\nThis EAP will give the opportunity to test the navigation changes, understand the direction Jira products are heading in, and share your feedback. As part of EAP, weâll set up a dedicated group on CDAC where youâll be able to discuss these changes. Please note that the designs in the EAP are not final, so you are NOT expected to make any changes to your apps during the EAP.\n\nForge custom fields on the Issue view will render inline in edit mode by default from (6 months from this announcement).\n\nDuring the transition period, you can use the isInline property in the app manifest to enable the inline edit mode for apps built with UI kit and Custom UI. You can read more about custom field rendering in the Forge documentation. After the deprecation period, rendering fields in the modal will be possible only using the dedicated UI kit modal component or Forge bridge API.\n\nThe marketplace license report has been enhanced to accurately handle some of the edge cases with respect to license status. Moving forward, instead of the created date of licenses, we will take into account the maintenance start and end dates to display their status in our license report.

      "# [Learn Git - Tutorials, Workflows and Commands](https://www.atlassian.com/git)\nGit is a free and open-source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Unlike older centralized version control systems such as SVN and CVS, Git is distributed: every developer has the full history of their code repository locally. This makes the initial clone of the repository slower, but subsequent operations such as commit, blame, diff, merge, and log dramatically faster.\n\nGit also has excellent support for branching, merging, and rewriting repository history, which has led to many innovative and powerful workflows and tools. Pull requests are one such popular tool that allows teams to collaborate on Git branches and efficiently review each other's code. Git is the most widely used version control system in the world today and is considered the modern standard for software development.\n\nBranch\n\nDefinition: A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process discussed in Git Basics, the first module of this series. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.",

      "# [What is ITSM? A guide to IT service management](https://www.atlassian.com/itsm)\nAt Atlassian, the team comes first. We’ve even created a team playbook to provide tools that help teams improve how they work. IT teams should be continually learning and improving. They must feel valued and empowered to make a difference in the company.\n\nRather than adhering to rules imposed by tiered reporting structures or rigid processes, IT teams can make informed decisions about adopting SLAs and which software they should implement. Strong IT teams are pivotal in fostering productivity and driving digital transformation, making them indispensable for robust company performance. IT teams are the core of IT Service Management (ITSM) processes and technologies.\n\nAfter focusing on the strength of the IT team, it’s possible to develop unique practices and capabilities to provide value to the company. No matter how reputable the source, it’s insufficient to simply “copy and paste” another company’s set of standards, and hope they will work in your unique environment.\n\nSuccessful IT teams craft their approach by drawing from frameworks like ITIL (the Information Technology Infrastructure Library) and carefully adapting processes to align with the needs and preferences of their customers.\n\nFinally, software and technology should support a team’s practices and amplify their impact. The best ITSM software fosters cross-team collaboration, empowers end-users, and automates mundane or routine tasks—giving everyone more time to focus on what matters most. We've all seen instances where technology becomes a hindrance, introducing unnecessary complexity and frustration.\n\nWhen technology operates seamlessly, it may seem like magic, but in truth, it’s a reflection of the hard work of the teams that use it.\n\nWhat is an IT service?\n\nIn the context of ITSM, an IT service refers to delivering technology-related support and solutions to end-users or customers. This encompasses a wide range of workplace technologies, including laptops, servers, and business-critical software applications. ITSM teams handle requests and incidents related to these services through structured processes, ensuring service efficiency, reliability, and user satisfaction.\n\nWhat is an ITSM framework?\n\nFrameworks are tools that provide ITSM with standardized practices and procedures. Frameworks can provide a platform that monitors continuous improvement for service delivery and support.\n\nITSM is an IT service management framework that provides services for various IT functions. It defines operating procedures, techniques, and supporting services that deliver efficiency and value to an underlying system's operation. Frameworks help companies define their ITSM strategy.\n\nPopular ITSM frameworks\n\nIT teams use a variety of frameworks to guide their work. The two most common are ITSM and DevOps. Other concepts include COBIT, SIAM, IT4IT, lean, and more.\n\nBelow, we’ll cover two of the most influential frameworks for modern IT teams—ITSM and DevOps—along with a common approach to ITSM. Let’s start by defining some key terms:\n\nITSM\n\nAs mentioned above, IT Service Management is how IT teams manage the delivery of IT services to customers. How a team approaches ITSM can be structured to align with ITIL practices and influenced by DevOps concepts.\n\nITIL\n\nITIL is the most widely accepted approach to ITSM. ITIL focuses on practices for aligning IT services with business needs. ITIL can help companies adapt to ongoing transformation and scale.\n\nITIL 4, the recent update to ITIL standards, represents a paradigm shift for IT teams. It guides teams to a holistic, business, and customer-value frame of reference and encourages a more flexible approach based on how your team works. The ITIL 4 Guiding Principles promote collaboration, simplicity, and feedback.\n\nPeople sometimes misrepresent ITIL as “the rules” rather than guidance, but that's open to interpretation. Just because we need to use processes and document work doesn’t mean we should generate cumbersome masses of records and bureaucratic overhead. There is no excuse for hiding behind processes or the ITIL “rules.”\n\nDevOps\n\nDevOps emphasizes accelerated IT service delivery enabled by agile and lean practices. DevOps improves collaboration between software development and IT operations teams so companies can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably. Notable benefits include increased trust, faster software releases, quickly solving critical issues, and better managing unplanned work.\n\nThough DevOps includes continuous development, integration, and automated delivery, the concept is based on building a culture of collaboration between teams that historically functioned in relative siloes. Much of the context and ethos behind DevOps is about moving away from old divisions and working together. Unfortunately, people often see this pertaining to just ‘Dev’ and not ‘Ops.’\n\nPeople typically pitch ITSM and DevOps against each other as an ‘either/or’ decision – “we are an ITSM or a DevOps house.” There is confusion about what ITSM and DevOps deliver and how they could work together. Modern, high-performing teams realize they need to be able to work both smarter and quicker but still require process and control.\n\nIt’s time to move beyond the ITSM vs DevOps ultimatum and use elements of both—whether you explicitly follow frameworks or not. DevOps is much more than just automated development and promotes the importance of collaboration and a blame-free culture. Moreover, ITSM and the ITIL approach shouldn’t be pigeonholed as an administrative burden but used in an agile way to fit different companies' unique needs.\n\nWhy is ITSM important?\n\nITSM benefits your IT team, and service management principles can improve your entire company. ITSM leads to efficiency and productivity gains. A structured approach to service management also aligns IT with business goals, standardizing the delivery of services based on budgets, resources, and results. It reduces costs and risks and ultimately improves the customer experience.\n\nSome of the most common benefits of ITSM include:\n\nAligning IT teams with business priorities tracked through success metrics\n\nEnabling cross-team collaboration\n\nBringing IT teams and development teams together through streamlined project management approaches\n\nEmpowering IT teams to share knowledge and continuously improve\n\nImproving request coordination for more efficient service\n\nPromoting customer-centricity with self-service and better processes\n\nResponding more quickly to major incidents, and preventing future ones\n\nAll of which decrease costs and lead to better service, as well as enhanced employee and customer satisfaction.\n\nITSM processes and services\n\nITIL 4 recently shifted from recommending ITSM “processes” to introduce 34 ITSM “practices.” Their reasoning for this updated terminology is so that “elements such as culture, technology, information, and data management can be considered to get a holistic vision of the ways of working.” This comprehensive approach better reflects the realities of modern companies.\n\nHere, we won’t worry about the differences in terminology. What’s important, regardless of your team's framework, is that modern IT service teams use resources and follow repeatable procedures to deliver consistent, efficient service. In fact, leveraging practice or process is what distinguishes ITSM from IT.\n\nOutlined below are some of the core ITSM processes:\n\nService request management\n\nService request management is a repeatable procedure for handling a wide variety of customer service requests, including requests for access to applications, software enhancements, and hardware updates. The service request workstream often involves recurring requests and benefits greatly from enabling customers with knowledge and automating certain tasks.\n\nKnowledge management\n\nKnowledge management is the process of creating, sharing, using, and managing a company’s knowledge and information. It refers to a multidisciplinary approach to achieving company objectives by making the best use of knowledge.\n\nIT asset management\n\nIT asset management (also known as ITAM) ensures a company’s assets are accounted for, deployed, maintained, upgraded, and properly disposed of when the time comes. In short, it's the process of ensuring that valuable items, whether tangible or intangible, are being tracked and used correctly.\n\nIncident management\n\nIncident management is the process of responding to an unplanned event or service interruption and restoring the service to its operational state. Considering all the software services businesses rely on today, there are more potential failure points than ever, so this process must be ready to quickly respond to and resolve issues.\n\nProblem management\n\nProblem management is the process of identifying and managing the causes of incidents within an IT service. Problem management is not only about identifying and resolving incidents but also finding and understanding the underlying causes of an incident and identifying the best method for eliminating the root causes.\n\nChange management\n\nChange management ensures standard procedures are used for efficient and prompt handling of all IT infrastructure changes, whether rolling out new services, managing existing ones, or resolving problems in the code. Effective change management provides the context and visibility necessary to avoid bottlenecks and minimize risk.\n\nITSM software and tools\n\nITSM software enables IT teams to align with business needs and take a strategic approach to change, transformation, and growth. A wide variety of ITSM software tools are available in the market, from standalone applications to platform services.\n\nWe often hear IT teams complain that the traditional ITSM systems and tools they use are inflexible and, consequently, difficult to customize and adapt to evolving requirements. There also tend to be different tools for the various ITSM processes.\n\nModular tools create barriers, silo end users, and cause a lack of visibility across teams. Traditional ITSM tools are often difficult to deploy and manage, leaving end users to adopt tools that aren’t intuitive, which also leads to deficient or non-existent self-service ITSM capabilities.\n\nChoosing the right service desk software for your business is critical, as the service desk is the foundation of a robust ITSM solution. The service desk serves as the interface between customers and the IT team.\n\nITIL itself defines a service desk as “the single point of contact between the service provider and the users. A typical service desk manages incidents and service requests, and also handles communication with the users.”\n\nThe service desk should also play an important role in managing other ITSM practices. Consider whether your service desk and other ITSM tools meet the following requirements:\n\nEasy to use and set up: Comes with a clean, intuitive self-service portal that makes it easy to request help, search for knowledge, and track progress on issues.\n\nEnables collaboration: Provides a platform for developers and cross-functional teams to work together for faster issue resolution.\n\nAdapts to your needs: Is flexible enough to support any resolution, escalation, or change process your IT teams might dream up.\n\nThe choice of service desk software is pivotal, as it forms the foundation of a robust ITSM solution, serving as the interface between customers and the IT team. Jira Service Management stands out as a solution that addresses these challenges, offering an easy-to-use self-service portal, facilitating collaboration among teams, and providing the flexibility needed to support diverse IT resolution, escalation, and change processes.\n\nAccelerating value with collaborative ITSM strategies\n\nITSM stands at the center of modernizing companies. As the rise of software-powered services accelerates, IT service teams enable employees and teams across companies to deliver value more quickly. The role of the IT team has transformed from supporting the business to actively differentiating the business itself. It’s time to move toward approaches to ITSM that emphasize collaboration, ease of use, and faster value delivery.\n\nJira Service Management is a valuable platform for ITSM initiatives. It not only supports seven essential ITSM practices but also provides a comprehensive ITSM template. This template facilitates the implementation of key service management workflows, ensuring a quick and efficient start to ITSM processes. By seamlessly integrating with collaborative practices and emphasizing ease of use, Jira Service Management is a strategic tool for IT teams looking to enhance their ITSM strategies and drive value at an accelerated pace.",

It only matters if you're job shopping and need a resume boost, or if you want to get into the really gritty details of how assigning works with project and component leads.    \n\n\nIMHO, the certifications are useless because very few companies actually use the tools correctly to begin with.\n\n## Comment ID ivfuma5 with +4 score by [(flatboy2016, Reddit, 2022-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/yotqcj/atlassian_admin_certification_worth_it/ivfuma5/) (in reply to ID yotqcj):\nI'm a consultant with an Atlassian partner and I think the certs are worth the trouble if:\n\n1. You're looking to change jobs and work for an Atlassian partner.  They're required for partners to keep their status.\n2.

Studying for the certification exam will expose tons of features that you're probably not using.\n\n### Comment ID ivg77qi with +1 score by [(PlasticSupport9822, Reddit, 2022-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/yotqcj/atlassian_admin_certification_worth_it/ivg77qi/) (in reply to ID ivfuma5):\nThank you!

The certs are great especially if you want to move into consulting with an Atlassian partner. But depending on where you want to go there maybe other certs that are equally or even more valuable. Ive spent a lot of time getting SAFe certified and agile certified. These have helped tremendously as I can my knowledge of the tools and use them in a way that will bring more value to the business. Tools are great but if they are utilized along with the right practices you still won't be successful.\n\nTl:DR - pick the certs that provide the best value to both your career goals and the business needs.\n\n## Comment ID ivg8ec6 with +2 score by [(gitfather, Reddit, 2022-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/yotqcj/atlassian_admin_certification_worth_it/ivg8ec6/) (in reply to ID yotqcj):\nI would look at the region you’re in. Certain regions the certificate holds value, specially around AsiaPac where consulting companies would require you to have the certification. \n\nFrom my experience working with both certified and non certified admins, there’s no difference in skills.

But some companies require them (Atlassian partners, for example).\n\nThe problem with certificates is simple - they are based on Jira. But almost any company (at least, I don't know any) uses Jira without plugins. So, in the end, you're doing the job differently because you can make it better (or you can make it at all).",

Jira and Wrike are the only two tools that would meet our needs, and I’ve received all the information I need from Wrike. But I can’t get any help from Atlassian’s account or support teams to answer any questions (seems like a common issue, I’m finding). So I’d like to speak with one of Atlassian’s partners that specialize in Jira Software and Jira Service Management. \n\nI have a thorough list of our needs, and I know we could have them met with the 1,000s of options in the Atlassian Marketplace, but I have no idea where to start. And the major question I have from my CTO at this point is what the cost per user would be with all of the integrations and add-ons we’d need. I also have his support to explore a professional services engagement to set up the tool the right way for us.\n\nCan anyone recommend a particular partner that they like (or tell me of any to avoid)?

      "# Post ID 1841wxq: Atlassian Certification Exam Tips 2023/2024 with +19 score by [(razimandom, Reddit, 2023-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/1841wxq/atlassian_certification_exam_tips_20232024/)\nIf you are seeking tips to pass Atlassian Certifications, you may find this article useful. Having started with no prior knowledge, I successfully passed six ACP exams in three months 2 years ago, and I just passed 4 ACP this month to renew my certifications. I am confident that with the right dedication, you can achieve the same.\n\nMy first ACP exam was ACP-600, and at that time, ACP-620 did not exist. I failed my first test because I had no idea the exam could be so challenging. I don't want you to encounter the same situation, so let's skip the success story part and dive straight into some exam tips.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ACP-620 Exam Tips**\n\nThese tips are designed for those who use Jira as a user, not as an admin. This means you are familiar with basic features such as changing status, adding comments, simple gadgets and reports, and modifying field values. Unfortunately, this knowledge alone may not be sufficient to pass the exam. I recommend considering the Cloud exam as a starting point.\n\nWhether you are Cloud or Data Center users, I recommend starting with ACP-620 because you can run Jira Cloud by yourself without installing Jira DC on your local machine or a cloud server like AWS. [The free version of Jira Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/standard) is sufficient for you to prepare for the exam.\n\nExamine the distinctions between team-managed projects and company-managed projects, as well as between Kanban and Scrum. Consider scenarios in which you would opt for Kanban, Scrum, team-managed projects, or company-managed projects.\n\nExperiment with each gadget and report. Understand the information it presents, as questions will guide you in selecting the suitable type of gadget or report based on specified requirements.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with [company-managed](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/permissions-for-company-managed-projects/) project permissions, paying special attention to the nuanced aspects of permissions related to 'Schedule Issues' and 'Resolve Issues'. Note that these project permissions also impact your ability to view the information in fields such as Due Date and Fix Version. Also, remember that 'Move Issues' permission does not mean you can move your issue's status, but you need 'Transition Issues' permission to change your issue's status.\n\nUtilize all board features such as swimlanes, board filters, board sub-filters, columns, and so on. The exam will ask which features to use based on given requirements.\n\nAtlassian shared very [detailed exam topics](https://university.atlassian.com/student/page/840992-acp-620-managing-jira-cloud-projects-certification) including references, which I highly encourage you to read and understand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ACP-610 Exam Tips**\n\nLet's assume you've successfully completed ACP-620—fantastic! By doing so, you've already acquired 80% of the knowledge required to pass ACP-610. The variations between these two exams lie in the fact that ACP-620 encompasses team-managed and company-managed projects, whereas ACP-610 introduces a distinct project permission for project administrators called Extended Project Permission.\n\nExtended Project Permission grants project administrators in Data Center (DC) a specific level of control over Screens and Workflows. Make sure to understand the range of actions a project administrator can perform under this permission, particularly concerning Screen and Workflow management.\n\nA project administrator without Extended Project Permission cannot edit the project workflow. However, with that permission, they gain the ability to edit it with some restrictions. For instance, they can add a status that has already been created by the Jira administrator, but they cannot create a new status from the workflow editor. It's essential to understand both the capabilities and limitations of what a project administrator can do with this permission. You can read more about this permission in Atlassian documentation ([Managing Project Permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/managing-project-permissions-938847145.html)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Udemy Exam Courses**\n\nIf you find it overwhelming to learn all of this, don't worry. During my preparation for ACP exams, I transformed my study notes into a set of questions in Udemy. If I'm not mistaken, I believe you can get it free if your company has Udemy Business account. Let's take a look at these sample questions from Udemy.\n\n**Sample Udemy Course Questions**\n\n*It is a bit slow to load GIFs on Reddit. You can view 10 sample questions* [*here*](https://udemyatlassian.com/atlassian-certification-exam-tips-2023-2024/)*.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/51z468dk8m2c1.png?width=1760&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9ecdeb3980a7c487446aca2dd7ee54bf6b4a1c9\n\nOn Udemy, you will utilize an exam simulator to acquaint yourself with the actual exam timing. After completing the exam, you can access a comprehensive explanation, link to Atlassian documentation, and GIFs in some questions, to enhance your understanding of the answers.\n\n**Sample Udemy Course Explanation**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m8ybve656m2c1.png?width=1620&format=png&auto=webp&s=47aaa45f8fa40ee5d76a6d4122dad75956fc4872\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**You can check other Udemy courses here:**\n\n* [ACP-620 Jira Cloud Certification Exam Practices 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/jira-cloud-certification-exam-practices-acp-620-managing-jira-projects)\n* [ACP-120 Jira Cloud Certification Exam Practices 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/acp-120-jira-administration-for-cloud)\n* [ACP-610 Jira Data Center Certification Exam Practices 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/acp-610-managing-jira-projects-for-data-center)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm currently working on the ACP-100 course, but it will take some time to complete. This is because it involves additional work to set up LDAP and a Mail server, and testing them in various scenarios.

Since you are familiar with the migration, maybe 120 because 120 will ask about workflow and project permission. My first cloud exam that I passed was 120, then 620, because I'm more familiar with the workflow and project permission.\n\n120 is more complex than 620, but it still depends on individual knowledge. I didn't have exposure to gadgets and reporting before, so I found that 120 is easier. After I've both knowledge, it is actually 620 is easier.\n\n## Comment ID kb2pox1 with +2 score by [(elloiseellipse, Reddit, 2023-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/1841wxq/atlassian_certification_exam_tips_20232024/kb2pox1/) (in reply to ID 1841wxq):\nI made a mistake to pay for the acp-620 with no experience.

You don't need to have 6 months' of Jira experience, as long as you've enough time to study, you should be good.

Unless it’s changed in the last 12 months, Google SSO via Oauth is allowed without Access. So you’re able to restrict only users to your Google Workspace environment to have access.\n\nWhat this means:\n* If you have Google forwarding SSO to your IdP of choice then this connector effectively gives you SSO’s logins via the Sign In With Google option.\n* You do **not** receive any of the benefits of provisioning though, including pre-populating Jira groups or teams via IdP groups.\n\nIt wasn’t perfect when we used it but it was free at the time.\n\n### Comment ID jearzns with +1 score by [(3percentinvisible, Reddit, 2023-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/126pr3p/is_atlassian_access_the_only_method_of_sso_to/jearzns/) (in reply to ID jeartqn):\nThanks, I'll take a look.\nWe don't use Google, and I personally wouldn't like to, but worth investigating\n\n### Comment ID jeprsjk with +1 score by [(fuck_all_you_people, Reddit, 2023-04-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/126pr3p/is_atlassian_access_the_only_method_of_sso_to/jeprsjk/) (in reply to ID jeartqn):\nsloppy squash thought rustic growth marvelous plate chop unite adjoining\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*\n\n#### Comment ID jeptiqe with +2 score by [(Goose-tb, Reddit, 2023-04-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/126pr3p/is_atlassian_access_the_only_method_of_sso_to/jeptiqe/) (in reply to ID jeprsjk):\nI agree, I view Access as a necessary evil.

It’s truly an art form here. If you're not on a PIP, are you even really working? The company’s commitment to ensuring everyone feels the thrill of living on the edge is truly admirable. It's like a rite of passage—every month brings a fresh wave of anxiety and excitement. Who needs job security when you can have constant, gut-wrenching uncertainty?\n\nNow, about the PR count. Atlassian has managed to turn code reviews into a competitive sport. Forget about writing clean, functional code. It’s all about the numbers, baby! Your worth here is measured in pull requests like you’re a racehorse on a track. The more, the better, right? Never mind if the quality suffers—what’s important is hitting that next PR milestone. And, oh, the thrill of having your PR comments count scrutinized as if each one were a personal reflection of your professional worth!\n\nAnd let’s not forget the working environment. The long hours and relentless pace make it feel like you’re in a corporate version of The Hunger Games. Survival of the fittest becomes your daily mantra as you navigate through a battlefield of endless tasks and shifting priorities. It’s a test of endurance where every day feels like a quest to avoid the next corporate elimination.\n\nIn summary, if you’re looking for a job where you can feel perpetually on edge, where your every PR is tallied and analyzed, and where the work environment resembles a high-stakes survival game, Atlassian is your dream destination.",

Unfortunately, the environment here isn’t great. With the recent shift in company culture, there’s a high chance of landing in a toxic team.\n\nIf you’re happy at your current job and just looking to boost your income, think twice before coming here. This place can be mentally tough if you end up in a team that tracks everything—like PR counts and comment metrics etc. What’s labeled as ‘growth’ , feel more like moving goalposts and make people feeling bad about themselves.\n\nMany of my teammates are feeling stressed and hopeless in different ways. If you’re considering a job change for the money alone and already have a role you enjoy, take a moment to rethink. The job market isn’t great right now, so it might be better to explore side gigs instead of risking your main job and your mental health. I hope this helps!",

But, if the “leadership” is a few months late to provide an update we’re only told that “they’re working on it”. The same applies to the company's abrupt transition from extremely aggressive hiring to lay-offs within a two month period, there was no acknowledgement of potential errors that may have occurred. - In the past few months, the executives' tone of voice has shifted to somewhat passive-aggressive. Sure, it’s difficult macroeconomic conditions, but there’s better ways to communicate that we need to switch strategy. At least for the organisation that Atlassian was aspiring to be. - A lot of toxic positivity, especially from the middle managers. Every re-org is celebrated like it was the the best decision ever. It's especially annoying with more challenging announcements like purging the Development Manager role. - Your career and overall well-being are heavily dependent on your direct manager. If you're fortunate, you have the potential to advance significantly, but if you're unlucky, you'll experience a burnout. And too many good people have become miserable because of bad managers at Atlassian. It’s basically impossible to escalate a conflict with your manager.",

This has led to a poor evaluation when employees cannot meet the unrealistic goals set on them.

When times got tough, the values were jettisoned and new people were brought in who’ve driven it further into the ground. Senior Meta and Amazon hires have been the worst thing for the company. People creating personal fiefdoms and just driving good people out. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, Atlassian always had problems, but they were more about a culture of shipping barely functional MVPs and moving on to the next thing. And the reorgs… It was like a dog spotting squirrels every five minutes. But it was worth it because the people were great and really tried to live the values. That’s gone now and there’s very little left to like.\n\nNew programs are rolled out and, when people inevitably complain about the tin-eared approach, the response is “trust us, bruh.”",

It feels like our workload has tripled, plus we need to track everything we do and show impact. The stack ranking performance review just doesn't make sense. Team members who do minimal manage to get higher ratings and others who work so hard get low ratings. Good people keep leaving because of the culture shift. I'm on my 4th manager in 3 years",

People in high positions with no direction and forcing lots of thrash as they change their minds constantly. Twice a year performance review where PR count and PR comment length are heavily weighted. Imagine drastically improving the code and your team's processes, having full support from your team and manager, then getting near review time and your manager asking you to bump up your PR count because it's not high enough.\n\nExecutives boast about giving unreasonable deadlines in the face of everyone trying to reason with them. They brag when their projects complete and don't acknowledge the late nights and weekends the teams worked to build a flashy proof of concept that won't scale. \n\nOverall, they've set up performance reviews and hierarchy in a way that discourages collaboration and encourages individualistic heroism. Ironic for a company whose mission is to \"Unleash the potential of every team.\"\n\nEven if you land on a good team with better values, the toxic culture still seeps in.",

The manager's approach primarily focused on questioning why tasks were taking longer without knowing other issues such as hotfixes and roadblocks.\n- Too many things to do besides work (surveys, set up goals, giving feedback, self-assessment). It made less productive.\n- Context switching is massive. It is a mind-killer. Once again, it is because of bad project management and lack of engineering resources and support. \n- They expect us to be an expert on everything. My role covered FE engineer, BE engineer, data engineer, product manager and CSR.\n- It’s hard to “play as a team” when you and your teammates have too many things on the plate. \n- It's more \"built with impact\". no matter how good your work if it doesn’t have a big impact, It’s nothing for them. Having big impact and doing it fast, that is just how they like it.",

You will likely not learn very much as a DS, but you will become an expert in one thing (be it experimentation, dashboard design, business performance, etc). DS added new leaders in 2023 which I'm a fan of; new leader seems very pragmatic and results-oriented.\n\nVery little source of truth in company data.\n\nI also have found individuals able to go in-office more frequently are getting promotions, more interesting projects.\n\nManagers: I've had mostly good managers here. However, the bar changed (or I just got unlucky). Latest managers have lots of experience with big name FAANG / corps, but not good communicators, very vague, say one thing but then do another. They seem to be viewed as good managers only if they work around the clock and attend 100 meetings a week.\n\nCareer opportunities: promotions are hard, and 99% of the work is on the IC to put together their case. DS growth profiles haven't been updated in 4 years.\n\nLatest hires (including management) don't seem to be as aware of, nor celebrate, longstanding company values.",

Regularly assess team capacities and offer resources to help balance demanding projects with employees' well-being.\n\nEnhance Remote Work Connectivity: Strengthen remote work practices by investing in tools and strategies that promote team cohesion and communication. Consider virtual team-building activities and ensure that remote employees have opportunities for career advancement and visibility.\n\nFocus on Career Development: Continue to offer robust career development opportunities, but ensure that these are accessible to all employees, including those in remote or less visible roles. Encourage mentorship programs and provide clear paths for career progression.\n\nNurture a Collaborative but Non-Competitive Culture: While healthy competition can drive performance, it’s important to nurture a culture that prioritizes collaboration over competition.

          "cons": "Atlassian used to be a great place to work, but management has deteriorated significantly, often seeming eager to find reasons to lay people off. After more than eight years with the company, it's disheartening to witness such a decline. The new rating system is unfair, downgrading employees despite their hard work. Unless you're working 25(yes 25)/7, you won't receive a decent rating, you aren't demonstrating much 'Org impact.'\n\nBeing a woman in tech is challenging, but being a mother in tech is even tougher. Despite the generous maternity leave policy, many new mothers, including myself, have received unfair poor performance reviews, leading many to leave the company. During my time here, I've experienced over three reorganizations and countless white male managers. When I finally had a manager who supported my goals for promotion, they were let go.\n\nWe’ve become worse than Meta, preaching admirable values but living in a 'Hunger Games' environment. At least with Meta, you know what to expect. The pressure to merge a certain number of PRs affects both performance evaluations and mental health. With everyone rushing to merge PRs, it's an incredibly stressful race—ironic for a company that preaches work-life balance. Asking for help in public channels often leads to management questioning your abilities; I’ve seen it happen repeatedly. Bringing concerns to HR feels like talking into the void. Lastly, We used to have free insurance, but now that benefit is going away. I used to love working here, but now I dread every day.",

Way to go! That'll demotivate your EAs and SEs 100%.\n\nIn fact, the company has now become so fantastically \"true blue\", that in the last 4 years they've actually had more CSOs / CROs than Australia has had prime ministers.

As soon as a feature is made, they don’t support it and rush to make a new one in order to show it in new reports.\n\nIn the last year, APEX was introduced, this is a system that evaluates developers.

Implementing regular training on diversity and inclusion isn’t just a box to check; it’s a necessity for fostering a culture where everyone feels valued.\n\nStabilize Leadership Practices: The constant shifts in policies and strategies are detrimental. A clear and consistent approach is essential for aligning team efforts and minimizing disruption. Leadership should engage with the team to formulate a stable, actionable strategy.\n\nEnhance Communication: Open dialogue should be prioritized. Leaders need to create a space where employees can voice their concerns without fear. Respectful communication is key to rebuilding trust and morale.\n\nEquitable Workload Distribution: Regular assessments of workload are critical to prevent burnout. Clear, realistic expectations are necessary for maintaining a healthy work-life balance.\n\nRecognize and Reward Contributions: A fair recognition system is vital. Employees should feel their hard work is appreciated, fostering a culture of motivation rather than competition.\n\nCultivate Team Collaboration: Promoting collaboration can alleviate internal conflicts. Investing in team-building initiatives can strengthen relationships and improve overall team dynamics.\n\nWithout meaningful change, I fear that the current environment will continue to deteriorate, further impacting employee morale and retention. It’s time to take these issues seriously and work toward creating a truly supportive workplace.",

          "cons": "After over two years at Atlassian India, I’ve finally \"resigned,\" and I can't express how liberating it feels to escape the toxic politics and biased leadership of the TA team.\n\nInitially, things seemed promising, but it quickly became clear just how hollow and lacking in empathy the team is—particularly toward female employees. I worked tirelessly from 9 AM to 8 PM or later, often sacrificing weekends. Don't be misled by the façade of permanent remote work; the reality is far from supportive.\n\nThe US and Australian leadership dictate the global TA policy, frequently imposing abrupt changes every couple of months that disrupt the entire team. They treat the India TA team like corporate slaves, demanding that we replicate strategies suited for their markets without regard for local scalability. The weak leadership has already laid off all contractual workers and decimated the executive recruiter and sourcing teams across different regions. When issues arise, the TA team is always the first to bear the brunt.\n\nThe HRBP team is equally ruthless, showing no respect for employees. Managers like Manoj, Kavita, and Sandeep are indecisive and classist, consistently overloading employees with projects under the guise of potential promotions. Expectations shift every quarter, often accompanied by disrespectful communication. Meanwhile, certain team members receive favoritism, leaving others in constant conflict over responsibilities. This creates a deeply demoralizing environment that severely impacts mental health.\n\nTeam politics are rampant, with individuals undermining each other to elevate their own standing. It's a toxic atmosphere where ingratiating oneself to management is the only way to succeed. \n\nOverall, the environment is not just disappointing—it’s detrimental.",

In my time there, I went through 2 re-orgs and 3 managers. It just always felt like being on a hamster wheel… in a hurricane. Today I received an email 7 weeks after I was laid off that started with, “ Congrats on your first year at Atlassian—we know that's a huge accomplishment and are beyond thrilled to be celebrating with you!” It was a bummer to receive that, to say the least, but it included a link to leave this Glassdoor review to “ help provide invaluable insight to future candidates and help us to improve your experience as an employee continually.” so here I am. My advice is to do proper change management of your automated emails when you layoff 5% of your workforce so that emails like this aren’t sent to hard working former employees that you eliminated congratulating them on a milestone they never reached.

But, if the “leadership” is a few months late to provide an update we’re only told that “they’re working on it”. The same applies to the company's abrupt transition from extremely aggressive hiring to lay-offs within a two month period, there was no acknowledgement of potential errors that may have occurred. - In the past few months, the executives' tone of voice has shifted to somewhat passive-aggressive. Sure, it’s difficult macroeconomic conditions, but there’s better ways to communicate that we need to switch strategy. At least for the organisation that Atlassian was aspiring to be. - A lot of toxic positivity, especially from the middle managers. Every re-org is celebrated like it was the the best decision ever. It's especially annoying with more challenging announcements like purging the Development Manager role. - Your career and overall well-being are heavily dependent on your direct manager. If you're fortunate, you have the potential to advance significantly, but if you're unlucky, you'll experience a burnout. And too many good people have become miserable because of bad managers at Atlassian. It’s basically impossible to escalate a conflict with your manager.",

However, the bar changed (or I just got unlucky). Latest managers have lots of experience with big name FAANG / corps, but not good communicators, very vague, say one thing but then do another. They seem to be viewed as good managers only if they work around the clock and attend 100 meetings a week.\n\nCareer opportunities: promotions are hard, and 99% of the work is on the IC to put together their case.

It's like a rite of passage—every month brings a fresh wave of anxiety and excitement. Who needs job security when you can have constant, gut-wrenching uncertainty?\n\nNow, about the PR count. Atlassian has managed to turn code reviews into a competitive sport. Forget about writing clean, functional code. It’s all about the numbers, baby! Your worth here is measured in pull requests like you’re a racehorse on a track. The more, the better, right? Never mind if the quality suffers—what’s important is hitting that next PR milestone. And, oh, the thrill of having your PR comments count scrutinized as if each one were a personal reflection of your professional worth!\n\nAnd let’s not forget the working environment. The long hours and relentless pace make it feel like you’re in a corporate version of The Hunger Games. Survival of the fittest becomes your daily mantra as you navigate through a battlefield of endless tasks and shifting priorities.

Implementing regular training on diversity and inclusion isn’t just a box to check; it’s a necessity for fostering a culture where everyone feels valued.\n\nStabilize Leadership Practices: The constant shifts in policies and strategies are detrimental. A clear and consistent approach is essential for aligning team efforts and minimizing disruption. Leadership should engage with the team to formulate a stable, actionable strategy.\n\nEnhance Communication: Open dialogue should be prioritized. Leaders need to create a space where employees can voice their concerns without fear. Respectful communication is key to rebuilding trust and morale.\n\nEquitable Workload Distribution: Regular assessments of workload are critical to prevent burnout. Clear, realistic expectations are necessary for maintaining a healthy work-life balance.\n\nRecognize and Reward Contributions: A fair recognition system is vital. Employees should feel their hard work is appreciated, fostering a culture of motivation rather than competition.\n\nCultivate Team Collaboration: Promoting collaboration can alleviate internal conflicts. Investing in team-building initiatives can strengthen relationships and improve overall team dynamics.\n\nWithout meaningful change, I fear that the current environment will continue to deteriorate, further impacting employee morale and retention. It’s time to take these issues seriously and work toward creating a truly supportive workplace.",

I worked tirelessly from 9 AM to 8 PM or later, often sacrificing weekends. Don't be misled by the façade of permanent remote work; the reality is far from supportive.\n\nThe US and Australian leadership dictate the global TA policy, frequently imposing abrupt changes every couple of months that disrupt the entire team. They treat the India TA team like corporate slaves, demanding that we replicate strategies suited for their markets without regard for local scalability. The weak leadership has already laid off all contractual workers and decimated the executive recruiter and sourcing teams across different regions. When issues arise, the TA team is always the first to bear the brunt.\n\nThe HRBP team is equally ruthless, showing no respect for employees. Managers like Manoj, Kavita, and Sandeep are indecisive and classist, consistently overloading employees with projects under the guise of potential promotions. Expectations shift every quarter, often accompanied by disrespectful communication. Meanwhile, certain team members receive favoritism, leaving others in constant conflict over responsibilities. This creates a deeply demoralizing environment that severely impacts mental health.\n\nTeam politics are rampant, with individuals undermining each other to elevate their own standing. It's a toxic atmosphere where ingratiating oneself to management is the only way to succeed. \n\nOverall, the environment is not just disappointing—it’s detrimental.",

      "# [Welcome to the next era of Jira by Dave Meyer on 2024-05-01](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/the-next-era-of-jira)\nHow did NASA land a rover on Mars? It all started with an ambitious idea, a great team, and Jira.\n\nJira helps teams do their best work and bring their ideas to life. And while good teams get the work done, great teams succeed over and over again. Which begs the question: what makes a great team? We believe great teams are built on a foundation of shared goals, coordinated work, and free-flowing information across functions.\n\nThat’s why the latest evolution of Jira offers a shared place for every team to align on goals and priorities, track and collaborate on work, and get the insights they need to build something incredible, together. We’ve taken the best of Jira Work Management and Jira Software to make a single project management tool ready to help any team go from good to great. And (throwback alert!) we’re calling it, simply, Jira.\n\nOne Jira, one invoice, and a billion ways to use it\n\nToday, there are over 1 billion knowledge workers looking for better ways to share and align on work. This means a greater reliance on tools to help teams work asynchronously across different geographies and time zones. With new collaboration and communication features built in, Jira puts cross-functional connectivity in front and center across everything teams do, from linked work to shared reporting. These new features include:\n\nGoal tracking to help teams stay focused and aligned\n\nAI-powered shortcuts that alleviate some classic pain points\n\nNew ways to visualize work and coordinate between teams\n\nRich integrations with Confluence and Loom to foster knowledge-sharing\n\nJira not only reinforces teamwork but also helps companies save money. Roblox saved $150k+ annually by consolidating from multiple tools to Jira, and saw a boost in collaboration and productivity – talk about a win-win.\n\nLet’s take a look at how Jira is helping siloed companies transform into connected ones.\n\nEvery team aligned to shared goals\n\nYour engineers, marketers, designers, and other teams may all work differently, but they should still be aligned to shared objectives. Bringing every team into the same Jira makes it easier for leaders to set goals, align teams to priorities, and track success across every project in flight.\n\nIn the next few months, we’ll be rolling out Goals in Jira. Users will be able to create goals in Jira’s list and issue views to visualize how each task maps to a higher objective. We’re also introducing new ways to easily view and track progress towards goals – a goals directory where every goal can be viewed and tracked, and goal progress charts in summary view where goals can be viewed in the context of your projects. With Goals, it’s never been easier to keep your teams aligned and understand how work is tracking against company-wide priorities.\n\nBreak work into bite-sized pieces with the help of Atlassian Intelligence (AI)\n\nAt the heart of teamwork lies the individual: when each team member is empowered to do their best, the entire team can achieve more. Starting soon, AI work breakdown (currently rolling out to Jira Premium and Enterprise users in beta) will make suggestions for breaking epics into issues, or issues into sub-tasks so you can spend less time breaking work down and more time moving it forward. Once you customize and approve the suggestion, your new work items will be created and nested in the proper hierarchy.\n\nA list view for every Jira project\n\nEach team prefers to visualize and organize work differently, according to their needs. That’s why we’re creating easier, faster, and more flexible ways to manage work for all teams – starting with bringing the list view to all projects.\n\nYou already know and love the board and timeline views. But if you live in spreadsheets (hello, marketing and operations teams!), you’ll feel right at home here, where in-line editing makes for an easy way to manage even the biggest backlogs. In addition to in-line edits, you can also make bulk edits in the list when multiple tickets need to be assigned to the same person or associated with a new goal. But the in-line fun doesn’t stop there. Need to create a new custom field? Configure and start using it right there in the list view.\n\nA successful launch requires tight coordination between developers, IT, marketing, sales, and support. That’s no small feat, but Jira makes it a little easier. Business projects can be viewed as a calendar with issues arranged by due date. Release dates from software projects can now be surfaced in corresponding business projects to help keep everyone aligned. (Note that calendars are coming to software projects in the next few months – stay tuned!)\n\nIncreased visibility for better decision-making\n\nTired of jumping between dozens of browser tabs to get a big-picture view of your project? Take heart. Plans (available in Jira Premium and Enterprise) let you combine issues from different boards, projects, and filters to create an all-encompassing view that spans multiple teams. Now everyone – from leaders to program managers to team members – can estimate release dates for cross-team projects, answer staffing and resource questions, or map out yearly goals, all in a single view.\n\nTransforming async collaboration with Confluence and Loom\n\nWith the explosion of distributed work over the last few years, fewer teams gather in the same room to brainstorm, plan, or make a decision. Thankfully, Jira’s integrations with Confluence and Loom make asynchronous collaboration just as effective as real-time teamwork.\n\nPicture a brainstorming session: you’ve already captured your ideas on a Confluence whiteboard and voted on your favorites. With a single click, you will soon be able to turn priorities into action by converting your top-voted ideas into Jira issues. You will also be able to convert the whiteboard into a Confluence page, and link to the issues you just generated.\n\nDistributed work has also prompted companies to use video to communicate in a more human way. Smart Links make it easy to embed rich Loom videos directly in Jira so teams can share critical updates, ideas, and decisions in the context of the work itself. Important information that once required a meeting or a written update can now be shared instantly across teams and timezones – without leaving Jira.\n\nStart connecting the dots with Jira today\n\nJira is more flexible, customizable, and powerful than ever. And it’s never been easier for teams – all teams – to work the way they want while managing projects, documentation, and knowledge cohesively in one place. We hope you enjoy these upgrades to your Jira experience – there’s much more to come!\n\nIf you currently have a Jira Software subscription, the new Jira is available to use today with no changes to pricing. If you currently have a Jira Work Management subscription, learn more about how these changes will take place.",

In addition to incident, problem, and change management, the Premium plan includes:\n\nAI-powered service and operations features with Atlassian Intelligence\n\nVirtual Service Agent via Slack and other channels\n\nAsset & configuration management\n\nDeployment gating with CI/CD tools\n\nAdvanced alert integrations and incident investigation\n\nReal-time incident monitoring\n\n24/7 support for critical issues\n\n99.9% uptime SLA\n\n2. Consumption-Based Pricing for Assets and Virtual Service Agent\n\nWe are updating the way we charge for Assets objects and Virtual Service Agent assisted conversations in Jira Service Management Cloud. These changes align with the value these capabilities bring to customers and will allow us to invest more resources into innovation and scale.\n\nThese features will be billed based on consumption, effective October 16, 2024 PT.\n\nIncluded in Jira Service Management Premium and Enterprise plans, customers can:\n\nStore 50,000 Assets objects for free. Above this limit, objects will start at $.05(USD)/object/month with volume discounts applied.\n\nExecute 1,000 Virtual Service Agent monthly assisted conversations for free. Above this limit, assisted conversations will start at $.30(USD)/assisted conversation/month with volume discounts applied.\n\n*To view details on volume discounts for Assets and Virtual Service Agent, please visit this page.\n\nAll customers will receive an email notice by September 17, 2024, about whether they are affected by consumption-based pricing.\n\nCheck your usage\n\nCustomers can check their site usage for Assets objects and Virtual Service Agent assisted conversations by navigating to Settings > Products > Jira Service Management > Feature usage. If you’re projected to exceed the new limits, we recommend optimizing your current usage.\n\nSince launching Jira Service Management, we’ve been on a mission to provide you with a powerful, yet cost-effective ITSM solution. Your feedback and needs have been the driving force behind our innovations, and we’re excited about the roadmap ahead.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about these changes, please don’t hesitate to contact us. We’re here to help you navigate this transition and ensure you continue to get the most value from Jira Service Management.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWhat’s on the roadmap for Assets and Virtual Service Agent to justify the changes?\n\nOur near-term roadmap features significant investments in Assets and Virtual Service Agent, including:\n\nNew channels for Virtual Service Agent including Microsoft Teams, Help Center, portal, and web widget\n\nAssets reporting for admins\n\nNew data management and analysis capabilities with Assets Data Manager\n\nSupport for 3M objects in Assets\n\nImproved linking of Assets to change and incident management\n\nWhat counts as an Assets object?\n\nAn object is a representation of a single, unique thing of a particular object type included in an object schema.\n\nThe total number of objects includes all schemas across your site except system schemas. System schemas are schemas used by other features in Jira to store information, such as Services. Products, Entitlements, and Services aren’t charged as part of consumption-based pricing.\n\nYou can track the number of Assets objects across all schemas in your site in the Feature Usage dashboard. Learn more here.\n\nWhat counts as a Virtual Service Agent assisted conversation?\n\nAssisted conversations include:\n\nMatched conversations – any conversation that was matched to an intent, regardless of whether the Virtual Service Agent resolves the issue or escalates it to an agent for further support. Read more about how intent matching works.\n\nAI resolved conversations – any conversation during which the Virtual Service Agent responds to the customer using Atlassian Intelligence answers, and the customer indicates that the response resolved their issue or abandons the conversation, resulting in the conversation being auto-closed.",

As a Jira developer, it's important that you're aware of the changes. The following resources will help you keep track of what's happening.\n\nAtlassian Developer Community\n\nMajor changes that affect Jira Data Center developers are posted in the Atlassian Developer Community, like announcing EAP releases, adding new Jira modules, or the deprecation of API endpoints. You'll also find handy tips and articles related to Jira development.\n\nCheck out our Atlassian Developer Community\n\nEarly Access Program\n\nAn Early Access Program (EAP) release is a public development release leading up to the official release of a Jira version. Development releases are a snapshot of our work in progress, primarily focused on allowing Jira users to see the new features in advance and provide us with some useful feedback. EAP releases can include changes like:\n\nChanges to our APIs\n\nDatabase changes\n\nChanges to Jira bundled apps and libraries\n\nChanges in our supported platforms\n\nDownload the latest Jira EAP release\n\nEAP releases include more mature Beta Release and Release Candidate (RC) but they generally don't introduce new changes. Instead, they provide bug fixes and tweaks to features introduced in earlier EAP releases.\n\nLatest EAP\n\nThe EAP releases give you an opportunity to test and fix your apps in advance of an official release. Refer to the following table to prepare for the latest Jira version.\n\nJira Software 10.1 and Jira Service Management 10.1\n\nJira Software 9.x/Jira Service Management 5.x\n\nStarting from 9.13 and 5.13, new Jira releases support only Data Center licenses. If you try to upgrade to the Data Center-only release with your Server license, Jira will fail to start, and you'll need to downgrade to the version you were on before the upgrade or provide a valid Data Center license.\n\nIf you're using Atlassian Maven Plugin Suite (AMPS) to build your apps, remember to update its test data with a valid Data Center license to keep your apps compatible with Jira.\n\nEarlier EAP releases\n\nCheck out our earlier EAP releases for the supported Jira versions.\n\nJira platform version 10.x\n\nApplicationDateReferenceJira Software 10.0August 22, 2024Preparing for Jira 10\n\nChangelogJira Service Management 10.0\n\nJira platform version 9.x\n\nApplicationDateReferenceJira Software 9.17June 26, 2024ChangelogJira Service Management 5.17Jira Software 9.16May 6, 2024ChangelogJira Service Management 5.16Jira Software 9.15Mar 21, 2024ChangelogJira Service Management 5.15Jira Software 9.14Jan 31, 2024ChangelogJira Service Management 5.14Jira Software 9.13Nov 30, 2023ChangelogJira Service Management 5.13Jira Core/Software 9.12Oct 26, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.12Jira Service Management 5.12Jira Core/Software 9.11Aug 29, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.11Jira Service Management 5.11Jira Core/Software 9.10Jul 07, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.10Jira Service Management 5.10Jira Core/Software 9.9May 30, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.9Jira Service Management 5.9Jira Core/Software 9.8April 15, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.8Jira Service Management 5.8Jira Core/Software 9.7Mar 08, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.7Jira Service Management 5.7Jira Core/Software 9.6Jan 17, 2023Preparing for Jira 9.6Jira Service Management 5.6Jira Core/Software 9.5Dec 02, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.5Jira Service Management 5.5Jira Core/Software 9.4Oct 26, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.4Jira Service Management 5.4Jira Core/Software 9.3Sep 15, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.3Jira Service Management 5.3Jira Core/Software 9.2Aug 18, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.2Jira Service Management 5.2Jira Core/Software 9.1Jul 08, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.1Jira Service Management 5.1Jira Core/Software 9.0Jun 15, 2022Preparing for Jira 9.0Jira Service Management 5.0",

      "# [CORS error on https://auth.atlassian.com on 2023-10-04](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/cors-error-on-https-auth-atlassian-com/73444)\nI’ve read multiple places that you can use the OAuth2 auth method with api.atlassian.com where CORS is effectively whitelisted.\n\nHowever, does this not include https://auth.atlassian.com? I am getting the CORS error (frontend request) from this domain. Since this is necessary to even access the OAuth2-based api domain, if you can’t use the auth server without a CORS error, then the whole thing seems pointless. I hope I’m wrong.\n\nThanks.\n\nWelcome to the Atlassian developer community @MarkJansen,\n\nWhen referring to auth.atlassian.com, I think you are referring to the first step in the authorization code flow. The docs refer to that as “Direct the user to the authorization URl”, which is not an API call but a redirect. Your front-end should not be treating it as an API call.\n\nIf you are trying to do this entirely from the front-end, the other problem is how your front-end would keep the client secret from being exposed. For front-ends, OAuth authorization code flow is not sufficient. In the OAuth world, the PKCE flow has become popular for front-ends but we (Atlassian) have not implemented that flow.\n\nI’m not sure if all that adds up to good news or bad news.\n\nActually I’m referring to the second step of the Authorization.\n\n\" Exchange authorization code for access token\"\n\nhttps://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/#2--exchange-authorization-code-for-access-token\n\nThis step is an API call, not a redirect as far as I know. Without this one API call working without CORS, it seems that it’s impossible to get what you need to use the CORS-whitelisted api.atlassian.com services.",

      "# [Atlassian Jira now a hub for knowledge management, AI tools by Beth Pariseau, Adrian Bridgwater on 2024-05-01](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/news/366582968/Atlassian-Jira-now-a-hub-for-knowledge-management-AI-tools)\nA bevy of feature updates for Atlassian's cloud platform this week marked the culmination of years of integration work between its products and data sets, setting the stage for knowledge management workflows that go far beyond its roots in IT.\n\nA core group of four products -- Jira; Confluence; asynchronous video communications acquisition Loom; and Rovo, a new AI-assisted search and automation tool -- now form the \"teamwork foundation\" in the Atlassian cloud, according to execs during keynote presentations at this week's Team '24 conference.\n\nWhile Confluence, Loom and Rovo were positioned as equal pillars within the Atlassian cloud product line, Jira hogged the spotlight on the keynote stage Tuesday. It subsumed the formerly separate Jira Work Management product to become a unified but customizable work management portal that users can tailor for individual teams from marketing and finance to software development and incident management.\n\n\"We simply call it Jira, and it brings together the best parts of Jira Work Management and Jira Software into one project management [tool] to help teams pursue shared goals where they plan and track their work,\" Atlassian president Anu Bharadwaj said during a keynote presentation. \"Goals are now directly surfaced in Jira so every team has visibility on what they're working on -- from developers coding up the website to marketers planning their campaigns. … For any given work item, teams can see the goal that work is contributing to.\"\n\nJira appeared in nearly every keynote feature demo, most often in the form of the automatically opening and populating Jira tickets from other newly-integrated parts of the product portfolio. In other cases, the Jira product line added long-awaited integrations between existing Atlassian products, such as full Opsgenie integration into Jira Service Management six years after Atlassian's acquisition. Other long-discussed feature additions announced at Team included a Jira Align flow metrics database for value stream management within the Atlassian Analytics service.\n\nThese developments advanced Atlassian's competitive ambitions in enterprise service management (ESM) where it began encroaching on ServiceNow's turf four years ago, according to Julie Mohr, an analyst at Forrester Research.\n\n\"[Atlassian] is putting knowledge at the forefront. It's not 'we'll help you build a bot.' It's 'we're going to help you build better workflows. We're going to help your knowledge workers get to information more quickly,'\" Mohr said. \"From a strategy perspective, it's a very unique position in that market.\"\n\nIn some areas of ESM, Atlassian will never unseat ServiceNow from its dominant position, but it can carve out its own niche with a lighter-weight, more accessible set of products, Mohr said.\n\nUnified cloud search a welcome development for users\n\nAll of Atlassian's cloud products are now underpinned by a unified data lake and a knowledge graph, which Atlassian calls the teamwork graph, that automatically maps relationships between customer data objects, teams of workers and workflow actions. That data layer and teamwork graph then feed into analytics dashboards and automated workflows that will soon be performed by AI agents.\n\nBut first: an improvement in the quality of search results within Atlassian's existing portfolio, based on AI-assisted search with retrieval-augmented generation, an area where Atlassian officials acknowledged past versions of products left a lot to be desired.\n\n\"Over the last six months, we've made it 25% more likely that you'll find what you're looking for in the first position of search,\" said Jamil Valliani, vice president and head of product for AI at Atlassian -- a position he left Microsoft's search and AI team for in October -- in an interview with TechTarget Editorial. \"We've actually gone from being behind industry leaders in search in terms of [normalized discounted cumulative gain], which is a standard way of measuring search relevance in the industry, to over eight points ahead of … the industry leader.\"\n\nThese investments in search are a good sign, said Andy Rosequist, vice president of engineering at Sector Alarm Group, based in Oslo.\n\n\"Atlassian's search has long been a top complaint,\" he said. \"It's so hard to tell if the information doesn't exist in Jira or Confluence, or if the search is just bad.\"\n\nUnified search across different cloud products, along with new integrations, means time savings for cloud customers, according to one Atlassian Community Leader.\n\n\"The fact that we can now search across products and remove that context switching [between tools] is … something that Atlassian has always struggled with in some of their search [interfaces], especially from a Confluence perspective,\" said Dan Tombs, Atlassian architect at a satellite communications company. \"It's nice to see that this is getting some real attention. And with AI, the fact that you can just ask natural language questions is really, really cool.\"\n\nAtlassian Intelligence leads AI automation rollout\n\nThroughout Atlassian's cloud, generative AI put a new sheen on existing products, such as automated service desk generation within Jira Service Management for finance, legal and HR departments -- a significant expansion from past releases' preconfigured request templates. Atlassian officials previewed upcoming AIOps features for automated root cause analysis and incident resolution in Jira Service Management.\n\nOther features of Atlassian Intelligence, first previewed in April 2023, that were showcased at Team '24 included an AI-driven document editor for Confluence, Jira and Jira Service Management that ties in with Bitbucket to create pull-request summaries and release notes. Atlassian Intelligence can break large Jira projects down automatically into smaller components, and automatically generated issue summaries will become available soon. AI-generated API documentation will follow based on Atlassian's acquisition of Optic this week.\n\nTombs said his team already has Atlassian Intelligence turned on for all its cloud sites and has used it to write natural language queries that the tool translates into Atlassian's Jira Query Language (JQL).\n\n\"It alleviates some of my pressure because I don't have to necessarily be on hand to support them if they're not very familiar with [JQL],\" he said. \"It's already been used for Confluence, not only from summarizing large docs but helping to produce those docs.\"\n\nAI-generated references to issue context could be useful for incident responses, Rosequist said, but he expressed doubts about AI-generated Jira issues.\n\n\"A big weakness of GenAI is it sounds like something that a person would write, and there's already lots of confusing tickets in the world without AI writing them too,\" he said.\n\nTombs said he disagreed.\n\n\"Most teams are slammed; everything's really busy,\" he said. \"That whole idea of just giving AI tasks is the future? It's inevitable. This is just the next evolution of [automation].\"\n\nThat isn't to say AI automation is without its risks and drawbacks, Tombs said. For instance, the quality of the data AI draws on must be high to produce useful results, which means organizations often must clean up existing documentation before applying AI.\n\nIt's important for teams to truly understand their objectives before creating automation workflows, he said, which can involve low-tech approaches.\n\n\"I always recommend you start with 'what am I trying to do and how?' and then 'what am I trying to use?'\" he said. \"I know I'm not the only Community Leader that does this. I always recommend that when you are starting with automation, just start listing requirements on a piece of paper.\"\n\nKnowledge management takes shape with Rovo\n\nAtlassian's forthcoming Rovo product will apply its unified cloud search and Atlassian Intelligence automation features to customers' third-party SaaS tools through custom connectors. Rovo will create knowledge cards and organization-specific term definitions by pulling together disparate data sources on the fly, according to Atlassian co-founder and co-CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes during a keynote presentation.\n\n\"Rovo uses AI and the teamwork graph to understand any document, connect it, cross reference it deduplicate it and analyze its concepts, without you needing to do anything,\" Cannon-Brookes said. \"And as more documents are created, Rovo is always working. New statement of work written in a Word document stored in SharePoint? Rovo links the work and rewrites the definition. You list the target customers for [a project] in a Google Sheet that comes in from your sales team? Rovo links the work [and] updates the members of the team and the definition of the project.\"\n\nA Rovo Chat AI assistant will answer questions users ask based on the teamwork graph even if the answer isn't written down already, according to Cannon-Brookes.\n\nAtlassian is also anticipating common enterprise AI data privacy concerns by building Rovo with a private instance of OpenAI's GPT API that doesn't retain user data and refrains from LLM training that would mix data from multiple cloud tenants, according to Valliani.\n\nContext-aware search in Rovo demos looks good, said Andy Thurai, an analyst at Constellation Research. But for now, Rovo remains in private beta, and a work in progress.\n\n\"The chatbots allow for conversation [that draws from] any of the documents within Atlassian's realm, though it is currently limited only to structured data, with no specific plan or timeline for unstructured data,\" Thurai said.\n\nStructured data builds in an organizational schema; unstructured data does not. It will be important to support both to integrate with a broad array of third-party tools, Thurai said. An Atlassian spokesperson said this is on the roadmap for Rovo.\n\nFinally, Rovo will support AI agents, a form of bot-based workflow automation that some industry experts predict will be the next big trend in generative AI tools. Rovo will ship with more than 50 agents pre-built by Atlassian and its partners as well as allow users to custom-build their own agents using Atlassian Forge or a built-in no-code interface.\n\nRovo agents previewed at Team '24 keynotes included a Communications Crafter for marketing teams to ensure blogs and other external communications follow company policy as well as a social media scribe that links to Canva for image generation.\n\nAll of this might seem far removed from Atlassian's DevOps roots. But there are tiebacks to Jira in pre-built agents such as Backlog buddy, which organizes, consolidates and prioritizes Jira ticket backlogs, and Feature Flag Cleanup, which Atlassian's internal developer teams used to clean up more than 460 feature flags during the last six months, according to Cannon-Brookes.\n\nKnowledge management is also an important aspect of DevOps, Tombs added.\n\n\"You're trying to break down that original silo [between dev and ops] and make things faster and easier from project initialization all the way through to actual management and operations,\" he said. \"A huge part of the development of any product or any kind of service is the knowledge transfer from one team to another.\"\n\nBeth Pariseau, senior news writer for TechTarget Editorial, is an award-winning veteran of IT journalism covering DevOps.

      "# [Atlassian combines Jira Software and Work Management tools by Frederic Lardinois on 2024-05-01](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/01/jira-software-and-jira-work-management-become-one/)\nAt its Team ’24 event in Las Vegas, Atlassian today announced that it is combining Jira Software with Jira Work Management into a single product under the “Jira” brand.\n\nThe origins of Jira, Atlassian’s flagship project management tool, are in software development and issue tracking for developers, but throughout the past few years, the company started to launch Jira versions for other teams as well. These included Jira Work Management for business teams like marketing, sales and human resources, which launched in 2021 and replaced a previous product called Jira Core.\n\n“We believe great teams are built on a foundation of shared goals, coordinated work, and free-flowing information across functions,” writes Dave Meyer, the head of product for Jira, in today’s announcement. “That’s why the latest evolution of Jira offers a shared place for every team to align on goals and priorities, track and collaborate on work, and get the insights they need to build something incredible, together. We’ve taken the best of Jira Work Management and Jira Software to make a single project management tool ready to help any team go from good to great.”\n\nThe idea here is to offer a cross-functional tool that allows different teams inside a company to more easily collaborate and track their work. While there were already connections between Jira Software and Jira Work Management (plus Work Management is already included in every Jira subscription for free), Atlassian says that this combined version will reduce friction and help different teams align on common goals, no matter whether they are engineers, marketers or designers, for example.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Jira Service Management for IT teams is not affected by this change.\n\nMore AI in Jira\n\nWith this change, Atlassian is also bringing a number of new features to Jira to enable this kind of collaboration. Unsurprisingly, these include several new AI-based tools.\n\nMaybe the most interesting of these is the new AI work breakdown (coming to Jira and Jira Premium users soon), which can help teams break down their epics into individual issues (or issues into sub-tasks) automatically — with the ability to edit them manually, too, of course. That takes away some of the grunt project management work and will free up project managers to focus on the bigger-picture items on their to-do lists.\n\nSoon, Jira will also be able to sum up issue comments automatically. This capability will also come to Confluence, Atlassian’s wiki-like workspace tool.\n\nCurrently, to become a Jira power user, you’ll need to learn the Jira Query Language (JQL) to search for issues on the platform. Now, thanks to the power of large language models, users will be able to use natural language to create these JQL queries.\n\nAnd for those occasions where you don’t know exactly what to write, Atlassian is also introducing a new generative AI writing tool to Jira that can create, summarize and improve descriptions and comments. These same capabilities are also coming to Atlassian’s Trello and Bitbucket, with Jira Product Discovery and Confluence following soon.\n\nSetting Goals\n\nSince the entire purpose of combining these two tools is to make collaboration easier, Jira is also getting a new feature that helps teams align on their overall goals. That feature, imaginatively dubbed “Goals,” will roll out in the coming month and aims to help users to “create goals in Jira’s list and issue views to visualize how each task maps to a higher objective.” There will also be a directory of goals and goal progress charts “where goals can be viewed in the context of your projects.”\n\nNew views\n\nJira is also introducing a few new ways to work with issues and visualize them. You can now see every project in a spreadsheet-like list view, for example, and make in-line edits. Atlassian notes that this will also make bulk edits easier.\n\nTo better track complex projects, Jira Premium and Enterprise users now get access to the new “Plans” feature, which allows users to track issues from different boards and projects in a single view.\n\n“Now everyone – from leaders to program managers to team members – can estimate release dates for cross-team projects, answer staffing and resource questions, or map out yearly goals, all in a single view,” Meyer explains in today’s announcement.\n\nSpeaking of time, there is now also a new calendar view for tracking business projects with issues organized by due date. This, Meyer notes, will help business teams more easily align their work in sync with upcoming software releases. The full launch of this calendar feature is still a few months out, though.",

      "# [Atlassian prepares to abandon on-prem server products](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37897351)\n>I brought Confluence into our org almost a decade ago — it was the best collaborative wiki tool at the time\n\nI respectfully disagree with that assertion! I remember 2012 (okay, 11 years ago). I had just joined a new team at work, and the documentation for the team was a lot of vendor PDFs and some .txt files from the lead stored on a network drive.\n\nThe company was just implementing Confluence, but it was slow on client and server side with no HA. That is the fault of the server team, not Atlassian, but still the software was ick.\n\nI spun up a shadow-IT Dokuwiki server that was much easier to use for a small team with text-based documentation needs. It had a naive \"calendar\" plugin that allowed the quick creation of pages based on date, which we used for oncall hand-off. Backup was zipping the data folder on the server.\n\nIt was probably 3 more years until our hand was forced to use the \"enterprise standard\" for business continuity purposes.\n\nThere is no perfect issue tracking system sadly and integration with prs and commits actually is becoming a hard requirement for me. This is not something that people should be updating to an issue tracker manually, ever. Or doing without entirely (more common). Also nice in Github is the integration with Github actions and being able to see whether something can be merged safely or not.\n\nI double as a product manager and CTO, meaning I do both code and planning. We're using Github issues and Asana. Both have their strengths and weaknesses. I'd take both over Jira any day. And since I'm in charge, my company is blissfully free of anything Atlassian.\n\nI kind of like Asana for planning. It's got a few sane features one of which is separating issues from projects. This allows me to quickly plan out projects and then add tickets to the relevant team boards. And another one is making it very easy to create issues in a spreadsheet like view that minimizes the click bureaucracy other tools have. Great when you basically are thinking at the bullet point level and just want to hit enter instead of having to fiddle with obnoxious modal forms.\n\nOf course for developers Asana isn't great because it has no markdown support and no usable github integration (a few commercial things exist but they are basically glorified sync tools). Github issues have a few nice features as well. I like working with check lists and then converting the individual items to tasks. That comes close to how I like to use Asana.\n\nWhere Github falls off a cliff is what passes for project management. I don't know what their PMs were smoking but it's just completely wrong and useless. It kind of lives orthogonal to issues (!!!!!) and nothing syncs automatically except with really awkward github actions crap. So, it only serves to add a lot of bureaucracy and busy work without actually addressing the core problem. A combination of over engineered and inadequate.\n\nThe core issue with Github is that issues are tied to a single code repository. From a planning point of view that is just horrible because I manage a product consisting of multiple code repositories and I need one plan that may involve zero or more code repositories and not several and I don't want to lock in my issues to a single repository before I have even figured out what the plan is. I guess that's what they tried to fix with their project management thingy. Except they messed that up badly.\n\nI'd love a tool that is a bit like Asana but more integrated with pull requests, CI/CD, the notion of work being distributed across multiple code repositories, teams, etc. I don't mean yet another sync thingy that copies tickets from system X to system Y. I would like a one stop shop that can be used throughout the life cycle of a software product from before any code is written until users / customers start reporting issues and everything in between. Doesn't exist.\n\nMicrosoft's \"on the record\" voice is always \"Azure DevOps is alive and has an active roadmap\".\n\nYou can read that roadmap for yourself. It is kept in a GitHub repository. Last time I checked this year the last commit was sometime in 2020. The last group of features that loudly launched for Azure DevOps were branded \"GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps\". (This is where I get the 2-3 years behind GitHub metric.) Microsoft's actions seem to be speaking a lot louder than their \"on the record\" words.\n\nI've heard from multiple \"off the record\" sources who are entirely hearsay and I cannot name names that \"Yes, of course Azure DevOps is dead.\"\n\nThe best, I can say, as mostly an outsider is that Azure DevOps is at least \"undead\" and definitely in some sort of zombie state. I've got an unsubstantiated feeling, again as mostly an outsider, that Microsoft is somehow superstitious about Azure DevOps' home office (Microsoft office in North Carolina was founded out of Microsoft's source control dreams) and is afraid to kill it.\n\nYeah, GitHub Projects/Issues have picked up a lot of \"features\" that only a (Microsoft) PM could love. Many of them don't even light up unless you are in a paid organization (or GitHub Enterprise) (not just a paid account, but a paid organization) so probably a lot of GitHub users probably don't even realize how much GitHub now has feature \"parity\" with Jira or AzDO. (Nor how quickly that has happened.)\n\nI'm mostly aware of it from GitHub Universe and Microsoft BUILD demonstration videos. Both of which give me a lot of signals that Microsoft internally has moved a lot faster to GitHub than it did from predecessors to TFS/TFS+git. Some of the teams talking about it are huge ones (both in terms of size but also in terms of weight internal/external to the company).\n\nFrom their own hype videos in the virtual sides of the two conferences, I certainly get the impression they reached \"good enough\" feature \"parity\" with AzDO Work Items internally a year or two ago, at least. That doesn't seem like the reason they keep saying AzDO is still alive.\n\nI do realize that AzDO has some big enough Enterprise customers though that not spooking them can be a big reason for the weird messaging despite their overt actions and all the subtle hints that AzDO is dead. But also, my understanding is that many of those customers don't entirely care if a migration needs to happen so long as they are given a migration with a far enough out deadline. [1] I know some companies seem to be acting more spooked that there isn't a deadline yet for AzDO's shutdown. (It was a factor in my last employer migrating to Atlassian's terrible products for everything but repository hosting after years in AzDO [after years in Bitbucket and Atlassian's terrible products and hating them; vicious cycle].)\n\nI obviously don't know what Microsoft is truly waiting for at this point to kill AzDO, which gets back to that feeling that it is something fundamentally weirder such as a superstition.\n\n[1] Case in point: no one seems to be shouting too much about the crazy Azure AD to Entra shenanigans because it has dates and timelines! The timelines don't even make sense: among other things, Azure AD B2B and Azure AD B2C both get marketed as \"deprecated\" months before their Entra counterparts are expected to leave \"Beta\" or \"Preview\" statuses and even more months before automated migration tools are expected to be available. But it is all a planned migration and that makes all the difference.\n\nCame here to say this as well.\n\nAll the talk about the office being a magnet, not a mandate... needs to apply to products as well. Magnets, not mandates.\n\nAtlassian hasn't added much in the way of new features to the cloud instances, and the cloud options often take a lot longer to return queries.\n\nAnd frankly, the \"migrations\" were never great... upgrading form some customized version of Atlassian (or just highly configured) to the cloud generally moved / changed things. Meh, sort of inevitable, but also really tedious. And don't get me started on how miserable \"half-migrations\" were where some teams moved and some didn't, or Jira moved but Confluence didn't. Those months in limbo with multiple logins and issues getting created in the wrong places were torture. Atlassian didn't really help customers with all this -- I was told they wouldn't even help us clone the Jira server so we could run migration tests... we had to do it live. (Something about Atlassian not offering another license without us paying for the test server as if it were a real server.)\n\nMoving off Atlassian seems like a good call!\n\nI pushed my org (at the time) to move to GitHub... we ran a test program, and it was successful, but I left the company before it was completed. I was so much happier with GitHub.\n\nReading this news makes me happy because I know someone somewhere is likely going to be have the chance to argue that it's time to migrate away from JIRA and Confluence.\n\nI personally they haveheld back nearly every organization I've worked for in some way or another over the last 15 years. These Atlassian products are the destroyers of enjoyment, satisfaction, project management and productivity.\n\nIssues I've encountered with Confluence and JIRA:\n\n* Painfully slow UI.\n\n* The confusing UX for JIRA.\n\n* The 100x ways to accomplish the same things in JIRA.\n\n* The fact project managers always end up going back to a spreadsheets because JIRA doesn't cut it, even though they insist they need to continue using it.\n\n* The way people bastardize every installation of JIRA it never seems to solve the problem it was designed to solve adequately, or because that was encouraged via \"plugins\".\n\n* JIRA can't be upgraded because someone installed a plugin that cannot be upgraded too, but the whole org is dependent on some functionality from said plugin.\n\n* The pathetic search in both product.\n\n* The shitty editor in confluence I really cannot believe anyone is still interested in using it.\n\n* Confluence not having support for Git or some similar version control system or pull-request like process support, making everyone to afraid to make changes to documentation.\n\n* Confluece, errors, just blows up sometimes when I go to save a document.\n\nI get that the plugins issues aren't entirely Atlassians fault in some ways ,but in others they are. I believe their plugin implementation allowed people to way too tightly integrate with the core product, not working like \"integrations\" but actually having the ability to break basic work flows. It was a huge mistake.\n\nI personally use GH issues and projects and the simplicity of it is really fantastic, when I'm forced to go back to JIRA at work, I just feel that I cannot believe I get paid to waste time wrangling these products into doing something useful.\n\nWe(as in everyone) are in a serious need of a new git server product. Just do git serving, and do it well. Preferably in a way multiple nodes can be run active-active for scaling and reliability. No need for cicd (Jenkins is fine for that, thank you very much).\n\nWhat are minimum viable features for me? Granular (per branch) security access. Integration with AD federation and other auth providers(congnito, aws iam) and ability to give AD groups rights.\n\nWeb hooks sending and receiving. For example launch a merge request webhook(to lambda via aws api gateway, or to Jenkins). Receive a webhook as merge request approval when some Jenkins job finishes.\n\nThere is exactly zero need for your repository system also run cicd jobs. It ends up doing both tasks badly.\n\nYou'd like an example of said badness? Ok, how about this: in gitlab enterprise if you create cicd jobs/pipelines there is no way to giving someone an ability to run that pipeline without giving that person ability to push to the repository and submit merge requests. Yes, you can then set it so approval is needed before merge, protecting said pipeline, but why? There has been a ticket on gitlabs own issues page about it for years and it is still not resolved.\n\nBut wait, there is more... Gitlab enterprise has no mode of working that let's you have more than one active server at a time so goodbye horizontal scaling.\n\nYou want to scale your cicd worker nodes? They want you to use docker mashine(a deprecated product) instead of writing a Plugin like ec2-fleet for Jenkins.\n\nIt is obvious gitlab tries to funnel it's enterprise customers into saas.\n\nThanks for your feedback. GitLab team member here.\n\n> We(as in everyone) are in a serious need of a new git server product. Just do git serving, and do it well.

      "# [Atlassian Releases Critical Software Fixes to Prevent Remote Code Execution by Ravie Lakshmanan, www.facebook.com, The Hacker News on 2023-12-06](https://thehackernews.com/2023/12/atlassian-releases-critical-software.html)\nAtlassian has released software fixes to address four critical flaws in its software that, if successfully exploited, could result in remote code execution.\n\nThe list of vulnerabilities is below -\n\nCVE-2022-1471 (CVSS score: 9.8) - Deserialization vulnerability in SnakeYAML library that can lead to remote code execution in multiple products\n\nCVE-2023-22522 (CVSS score: 9.0) - Remote code execution vulnerability in Confluence Data Center and Confluence Server (affects all versions including and after 4.0.0)\n\nCVE-2023-22523 (CVSS score: 9.8) - Remote code execution vulnerability in Assets Discovery for Jira Service Management Cloud, Server, and Data Center (affects all versions up to but not including 3.2.0-cloud / 6.2.0 data center and server)\n\nCVE-2023-22524 (CVSS score: 9.6) - Remote code execution vulnerability in Atlassian Companion app for macOS (affects all versions up to but not including 2.0.0)\n\nAtlassian described CVE-2023-22522 as a template injection flaw that allows an authenticated attacker, including one with anonymous access, to inject unsafe user input into a Confluence page, resulting in code execution.\n\nThe Assets Discovery flaw allows an attacker to perform privileged remote code execution on machines with the Assets Discovery agent installed, whereas CVE-2023-22524 could permit an attacker to achieve code execution by utilizing WebSockets to bypass Atlassian Companion's blocklist and macOS Gatekeeper protections.\n\nThe advisory comes nearly a month after the Australian software company revealed all versions of its Bamboo Data Center and Server products are impacted by an actively exploited critical security flaw in Apache ActiveMQ (CVE-2023-46604, CVSS score: 10.0). Fixes have been released in versions 9.2.7, 9.3.5, and 9.4.1 or later.\n\nWith Atlassian products becoming lucrative attack vectors in recent years, it's highly recommended that users move quickly to update affected installations to a patched version.",
      "# [Atlassian Team '24: the Jira news from Las Vegas](https://www.jodocus.io/en/post/atlassian-team24-jira-news)\nThis year, Atlassian shared some exciting news at Team '24 in Las Vegas. Besides Atlassian Intelligence, all eyes are on Jira, with Atlassian announcing two interesting and long-awaited updates.\n\nMerger of Jira Work Management and Jira Software into Jira\n\nThis announcement was likely one of the major highlights at Atlassian Team '24: Jira Work Management and Jira Software will be merged into a single productâJira. The goal is to create a single, unified project management tool that efficiently supports both software and business teams.\n\nThis shift brings multiple benefits to teams. Now, they only need to work within a single tool that consolidates all their tasks and information. At the same time, managing multiple products becomes significantly easier. Tasks like billing, provisioning, and permissions become simpler and more streamlined.\n\nNew features\n\nThe merging of Jira Work Management and Jira Software brings not only advantages but also new features:\n\nGoals: Jira users can now create goals directly in Jira and link them to projects or tasks. This provides teams with a better overview of their objectives and the associated tasks. Users can also view a list of all company goals and the teams involved in the \"Goals Directory,\" ensuring everyone stays on track.\n\nPlans: The best features from Jira Work Management are now available in Jira Plans (formerly Advanced Roadmaps). New overviews offer a calendar view, an updated summary view for quick metric insights, and a user-friendly interface that makes it easier to create and navigate plans.\n\nList View: The List View, previously exclusive to Jira Work Management, is now available in any Jira project, including software projects. It allows for editing task information in a table-like format without having to click into each individual task.\n\nAtlassian Intelligence: Another exciting feature is Â AI work Â breakdown. This functionality (currently in beta mode for Premium and Enterprise users) suggests ways to split epics into issues or issues into sub-issues, making work organization much simpler. Once customized and approved, Atlassian Intelligence creates the new work items and sorts them into the correct hierarchy.\n\nWhat does this mean for Jira users?\n\nStarting May 1, 2024, Jira Work Management will no longer be available for standalone purchase. Existing customers with a Jira Work Management subscription can continue to use it until early 2025, after which it will be automatically transitioned to the new Jira version.\n\nThis transition will not affect existing projects, and there will be no pricing changes. Atlassian is also offering an automatic 10% discount on the new Jira subscription for 12 months after the migration.\n\nFor Jira Software users, nothing changes initially. The new features and user interface will be added automatically, without affecting existing projects or plans. Speaking of the new user interface...\n\nJira is getting a new UI\n\nAnother major announcement at Team '24 is the completely redesigned UI for Jira. The new navigation aims to improve usability and create a consistent experience across all Atlassian products, making Jira even more intuitive and efficient. Here are some of the key changes:"

The company has been focusing on integrating AI capabilities into its products to improve user experience and operational efficiency [(TechTarget, 2024)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/news/366582968/Atlassian-Jira-now-a-hub-for-knowledge-management-AI-tools).\n\n## Recent Developments\n### Merging of Jira Products\nAtlassian recently announced the merger of Jira Software and Jira Work Management into a single product simply called \"Jira.\" This change aims to create a unified project management tool that supports both software development and business teams, facilitating better collaboration and task management [(TechCrunch, 2024)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/01/jira-software-and-jira-work-management-become-one/). The new Jira will feature enhanced capabilities for goal tracking, project visualization, and AI-driven work breakdown suggestions [(Meyer, Atlassian, 2024)](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/the-next-era-of-jira).\n\n### AI Integration\nAtlassian is rolling out several AI features across its products, including Jira. Notable enhancements include AI-powered work breakdown suggestions, which will help users automatically split larger tasks into manageable sub-tasks. This feature is currently in beta for Jira Premium and Enterprise users [(TechCrunch, 2024)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/01/jira-software-and-jira-work-management-become-one/). Additionally, the integration of Atlassian Intelligence aims to improve search functionalities and automate various workflows, enhancing overall productivity [(TechTarget, 2024)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/news/366582968/Atlassian-Jira-now-a-hub-for-knowledge-management-AI-tools).\n\n### Financial Performance\nAtlassian reported a revenue of approximately $4.36 billion for the trailing twelve months, with a net income loss of $300.52 million [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TEAM/). The company's stock has shown a year-to-date return of 32.63%, indicating strong market performance despite ongoing challenges in profitability [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TEAM/).\n\n## Product Overview: Jira\n### General Information\nJira is Atlassian's flagship project management tool, originally designed for software development and issue tracking. Over the years, it has evolved to cater to various business functions, including marketing, sales, and operations. The recent merger of Jira Software and Jira Work Management into a single platform aims to streamline project management across different teams [(TechCrunch, 2024)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/01/jira-software-and-jira-work-management-become-one/).\n\n### New Features and Enhancements\n1. **Unified Goals and Plans**: The new Jira will allow users to create and track goals directly within the platform, providing visibility into how individual tasks contribute to broader objectives. A \"Goals Directory\" will help teams stay aligned on priorities [(Meyer, Atlassian, 2024)](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/the-next-era-of-jira).\n\n2. **List View and Calendar Features**: Jira will introduce a list view for all projects, enabling users to manage tasks in a spreadsheet-like format. A calendar view will also be available for tracking business projects, enhancing visibility and coordination [(TechCrunch, 2024)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/01/jira-software-and-jira-work-management-become-one/).\n\n3. **AI-Powered Work Breakdown**: The AI work breakdown feature will suggest ways to decompose larger tasks into smaller, actionable items, reducing the manual effort required for project management [(TechCrunch, 2024)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/01/jira-software-and-jira-work-management-become-one/).\n\n4. **Integration with Other Atlassian Products**: Jira will enhance its integration capabilities with tools like Confluence and Loom, facilitating better knowledge sharing and asynchronous collaboration [(Meyer, Atlassian, 2024)](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/the-next-era-of-jira).\n\n### User Feedback and Market Position\nUser feedback on Jira has been mixed, with some praising its comprehensive features while others criticize its complexity and user interface. The recent updates aim to address these concerns by simplifying navigation and improving usability [(TechTarget, 2024)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/news/366582968/Atlassian-Jira-now-a-hub-for-knowledge-management-AI-tools). Analysts suggest that Atlassian's focus on AI and integration positions it well against competitors like ServiceNow, particularly in the enterprise service management space [(TechTarget, 2024)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/news/366582968/Atlassian-Jira-now-a-hub-for-knowledge-management-AI-tools).\n\n## Executive Insights\nAnu Bharadwaj, Atlassian's president, emphasized the importance of aligning teams around shared goals, stating, \"We believe great teams are built on a foundation of shared goals, coordinated work, and free-flowing information across functions\" [(Meyer, Atlassian, 2024)](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/the-next-era-of-jira). This philosophy underpins the recent changes to Jira, aiming to enhance collaboration across diverse teams.\n\n## Conclusion\nAtlassian continues to innovate and adapt its product offerings, particularly with the recent merger of Jira Software and Jira Work Management. The integration of AI features and a focus on user experience are likely to enhance Jira's appeal to a broader audience. For prospective candidates and investors, Atlassian's commitment to improving its product suite and market position presents a compelling opportunity for growth in the software industry."
