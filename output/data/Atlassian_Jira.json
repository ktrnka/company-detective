      "# [Microservices [What is it & Top Benefits]](https://www.atlassian.com/microservices)\nUntil about 2013, companies usually built enterprise software by constructing applications as single units with large codebases, a monolithic architecture. As software became more complex and cloud computing gained popularity, this approach became less practical.\n\nThe advent of software-as-a-service products (cloud-delivered applications) allowed companies to use providers, such as Amazon Web Services, to create new servers and add redundancy quickly. This ensured that services stayed online during upgrades. It also ushered in a new era of velocity and agility. Users began to expect quick upgrades and improvements, prompting companies to change their development processes.\n\nCompanies began to break applications into smaller, independent services or microservices. For example, instead of including a messaging inbox as part of a monolithic e-commerce platform, they might create a separate microservice for this functionality.\n\nIn parallel, developers started working in smaller, more specialized groups that modified and improved individual services without risk to the entire application. These groups often took responsibility for the operations of their code, as well — a model called DevOps. To facilitate these changes, project managers began to develop new methodologies, such as Agile, which divides projects into smaller, more frequent releases.\n\nRead on to learn more about the anatomy of microservices-based applications. Also, discover how Atlassian’s Compass reduces complexity while allowing developers to reap the benefits of this architectural model.\n\nMicroservices-based architecture has many benefits, but it also comes with challenges.\n\nOne challenge of microservices is that the independent services generate their logs. This is a disadvantage compared to monoliths' centralized logs, which provide a single source of truth for developers and operations teams. Monitoring and infrastructure management are also more complicated since many moving pieces exist. Testing and debugging are challenging because, unlike monoliths, no integrated development environment (IDE) exists.\n\nAtlassian's Compass can help with all these challenges. Compass facilitates collaboration and allows companies to manage the complexities of distributed architectures as they scale. It does this by bringing the disconnected information together in a central, searchable location.",

This decision is part of our ongoing commitment to enhancing security and protecting customer trust.\n\nForge Apps that have already been granted waivers must ensure a lack of alternative solutions within Forge. They can continue to operate, but no additional waivers will be granted for new modules or new functionality within the same app.\n\nConnect apps that have been granted waivers and any existing Connect app requesting or storing Atlassian user API tokens are required to migrate to Forge, with tokens stored in Forge encrypted storage.\n\nWith the recent updates to our content delivery network (CDN), all Custom UI apps now include the Atlassian emojis API URL in the allow-list by default.

To learn more about Runs on Atlassian, see this developer blog post.\n\nNote, the removal of egress does not require a major version update of apps.\n\nThe fiveMinute scheduled trigger interval is now generally available (GA).\n\nDevelopers can now use the scheduled trigger module to create scheduled trigger modules in a Forge app with intervals of fiveMinute, hour, day, and week.\n\nFor more information on using these intervals, see the https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/manifest-reference/modules/scheduled-trigger/#scheduled-trigger module documentation.\n\nWe’ve added a new optional parameter openOnInsert to the configuration object in the manifest of Forge macros. This allows developers to control if the custom configuration modal is automatically opened when first inserted.\n\nFor more information, see Macro.\n\nWith the introduction of draft pull requests in Bitbucket Cloud, REST API endpoints for pull requests now include a boolean attribute draft that can be used in both read and write operations. Webhook event paylods for pull requests also now include the draft parameter.\n\nNote that the draft attribute is a separate field from the pull request state. Draft pull requests will always have state: \"OPEN\" and draft: true.\n\nFor further info, please see our developer documentation.\n\nREST API docs\n\nWebhook event docs\n\nReminder: Starting , a subset of Connect extension points will no longer be available on Confluence pages. For details, see the original deprecation notice linked below.\n\ndeprecation notice Deprecating a subset of Confluence page extension points\n\nAction is required from developers using deprecated extension points.",

      "# Post ID u0j7oz: Atlassian alternatives thread with +593 score by [(PaleoSpeedwagon, Reddit, 2022-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/)\nHey y'all, [for one reason or another](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u01uia/atlassian_is_still_down/), some of us are looking for alternatives to Atlassian products. I thought I'd try to start a little thread here where we can share our discoveries. What I'd love to see, if you have experience with a product and want to share, is:\n\n* Name of product\n* Which Atlassian product would it replace?\n* What are the best parts about it?\n* Are there any gotchas you've noticed?\n* Presence of useful features you care to talk about: SSO, backup/restore, integrations\n\nFor example, [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/). A Jira alternative with an eye toward project management. It worked well for our scrum team, I believe it also supports Kanban. The UI is modern. It's got tons of integrations to things people actually use (e.g. Git, Slack) and the Enterprise level, at least, supports SSO (I don't know if other levels do). Pricing seems reasonable. They do point-in-time backups every 6 hours and allow you to export your data. It's been a few years since I worked with it, but I remember setting up our stories/columns was a little fiddly. And of course, it's a one-trick pony. It will not replace Confluence.\n\nHere are the products I've seen mentioned, none of which I have experience with, but it would be rad if some of you with experience spoke up on these:\n\n* [Notion.so](https://Notion.so)\n* [Outline](https://www.getoutline.com/)\n* [Phabricator](https://www.phacility.com/phabricator/)\n* [BookStack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/)\n* [Youtrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/)\n\n## Comment ID i478jlv with +116 score by [(thursday51, Reddit, 2022-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i478jlv/) (in reply to ID u0j7oz):\nHoly *shit*, are they STILL down???\n\n### Comment ID i47uvqu with +78 score by [(ThisIsTenou, Reddit, 2022-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i47uvqu/) (in reply to ID i478jlv):\nShort answer: Yes.\n\nLong answer: Very much.\n\nhttps://status.atlassian.com/\n\n#### Comment ID i487rgr with +38 score by [(castillar, Reddit, 2022-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i487rgr/) (in reply to ID i47uvqu):\nThanks for this—totally screencapping that Jira work record for the next time someone grouches at us for using Jira Datacenter instead of going “all-in on all-cloud all-the-time”.\n\n### Comment ID i48irea with +31 score by [(1esproc, Reddit, 2022-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i48irea/) (in reply to ID i478jlv):\nThis was apparently for under 400 customers at the start, it's not like it's all their cloud customers.

This is almost scarier than if it was a global outage. Because it was only 400 customers, but here we are, a week later, and they still have only been able to restore 160 customers. Speaking as an ops eng, to me this reveals a rather terrifying house of cards from a systems architecture standpoint. \n\nThe fact that Atlassian has been in business so long and has never, as a matter of *policy*, been willing to invest energy in restoring a single customer, tells me that this work is simply too laborious for them, too laden with \"if/then\" landmines that you find when services are bolted onto the side of an original systems design rather than thoughtfully integrated at the outset. \"We can't script this because it's too bespoke\" is NOT an enterprise answer to any request. \n\nAnd the folks in this thread who are like \"Whew! We weren't hit, we sure got lucky,\" I say, yeah, you got lucky. This time. But if they're rolling scripts out to prod without proper change management, it's only a matter of time before you're next. \n\nStop what you're doing and back your content up right now.\n\n#### Comment ID i4ahyfd with +1 score by [(The-Dark-Jedi, Reddit, 2022-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i4ahyfd/) (in reply to ID i48irea):\nAnother thread mentioned 35% of their cloud customer base.\n\n### Comment ID i497uwp with +6 score by [(landob, Reddit, 2022-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i497uwp/) (in reply to ID i478jlv):\nAs someone with self hosted Atlassian...I am very glad we are self hosting...\n\n### Comment ID i49eim3 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i49eim3/) (in reply to ID i478jlv):\nNot sure exactly what the outage is tbh, We migrated to Atlassian cloud last quarter and last week we saw 0 issues last week, other than I believe someone said it took a little long to move pages between folders.\n\n## Comment ID i46bgif with +37 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i46bgif/) (in reply to ID u0j7oz):\nWe use GitLab and teamdynamix at work.\n\nI use mantisbt and gitea at home.\n\n### Comment ID i47hqd3 with +12 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i47hqd3/) (in reply to ID i46bgif):\nGitea actually is rather amazing for it's size\n\n#### Comment ID i48tzgx with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i48tzgx/) (in reply to ID i47hqd3):\nYep, it does everything I need and then some.\n\n### Comment ID i47atnx with +2 score by [(qci, Reddit, 2022-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i47atnx/) (in reply to ID i46bgif):\nI like Kanboard for project management.\n\n## Comment ID i468q1e with +103 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i468q1e/) (in reply to ID u0j7oz):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID i46igx4 with +119 score by [(DaNPrS, Reddit, 2022-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/u0j7oz/atlassian_alternatives_thread/i46igx4/) (in reply to ID i468q1e):\nWe started using this last year.

Missing key features like view counts and page stats, the ability to search only within a specific 'pages and subpages (ie a KB), and the organization of 'pages' within a workspace is woefully inadequate for any halfway large organization. Shit you can't even link pages from elsewhere in your workspace without duplicating them under every page they're linked to, its atrocious. Nor can you have sub-pages without them being visibly linked on every parent page. These problems *really* show when your org reaches any significant size. Formatting pages is also nice when you learn all the hacks and glitches to bring it up to pae with the basic functionality of *squarespace*, but unfortunately so much of it relies on you intentionally glitches things that it can and will break your formatting with updates.

I want it to succeed, but I've got some complaints:\n\n- **No \"group-level\" issues**: (Issues are scoped to projects.) My team contains both engineers as well as non-engineers. When there's a bug to report, which project do you create the issue in? We've got a bunch of separate projects because of how we split up our code -- some are \"frontend\", others  \"backend\" for separate services. Best approach is to either (ab-)use \"Epics\" as user stories (good luck explaining to people that they need to ignore the \"Create Issue\" button) or simply move issues to the correct project, possibly from a single empty \"Inbox\" project (which *closes* the original issue and creates a new one *with a new number* in the destination project - making it really difficult for my project manager to keep track of). **Issues are directly coupled to deployable units of code, which places undue burden on bug reporters**.\n- **Issue editor isn't WYSIWYG** - I expect they'll fix this soon; the Wiki editor gained a WYSIWYG option recently.\n- **Can't require specific fields when issues are created** - I've heard people complain about project managers over-configuring JIRA so logging an issue requires filling out a million form items. But it would be pretty great if I could force issue reporters to specify which project to track my time toward when I fill out my timecard, rather than me hound them for it after the fact.\n\nThat's... well, that's most of it.

Of course, it wasn't visible to them because they do all their testing on their internal VPN 🤦‍♂️\n\nGitHub/GitHub actions would be my recommendation for code/build. Decent community, and support hasn't been terrible yet.\n\nOctopus Deploy is my recommendation for deployment/release management - you actually get to talk to developers when troubleshooting an instance, and they'll actually log in and take a look (with permission of course) rather than just reading you a script.\n\nThat leaves work tracking (jira) and wiki (confluence). GitHub does an ok job at Work Tracking if you're a more technical company.

It is a replacement for Jira, once devs get their hands on it, they tend to really like it. In my opinion it is a great product, you can do diffs within phab itself and it is extremely customize-able. Herald rules allow you to do so many odd little jobs. The downside's are we had trouble scaling it up, and it is no longer actively maintained. It was originally developed at facebook, and then spun off into it's own product and company. I believe facebook is still using it in some form or another, underneath a much nicer GUI. If you like to tinker, I still think it is a solid product.

For a period of time, Jira was the go-to tool for project management. Once a company starts using it, it's difficult to build enough momentum to switch to something else. So it sticks.\n\nThe real problem with Jira is that it's too customizable, which makes it easy for people to develop painful workflows and systems. Jira has too many complex options and many project managers feel a need to use as many of the features as they can. If you have an ambitious project manager with Jira admin privileges, you can end up with a mess of workflows, tickets with way too many fields, and other busywork that makes Jira painful to use.\n\nUsing basic Jira, especially their next-gen project format, is actually not that different than any other generic ticket management software. As long as you can keep the project managers from over complicating it, Jira isn't too bad.\n\n### Comment ID g6lby8d with +21 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6lby8d/) (in reply to ID g6l49vo):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID g6lfbzy with +12 score by [(qeomash, Reddit, 2020-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6lfbzy/) (in reply to ID g6lby8d):\nStates are low priority to remove for me.

What they actually hate is the process their company built. \n\nJira can be used to build out pretty much any process, but that makes it also very complex to manage. So people basically sit down and build out \"THE PROCESS\" over a couple weeks, and then never want to touch it again. However, processes need to grow and change as companies do, and when that happens you end up being forced to use your company's antiquated process in Jira while trying to do work in the now. And developers, especially younger ones, blame this on Jira instead of not having a person who can go into Jira and change the workflows to something more sane.\n\nThat said, I have my gripes. It is sometimes VERY slow. It has a big learning curve for customization: you need someone on staff that is good at managing it, and is willing to make changes as the need comes. \n\nI've used Microsoft Team Foundation, I've used Trello, I've used older stuff like HP's thing they bought and mangled a decade ago. Nothing is \"great\". You need to make the tool fit what you're doing.\n\n## Comment ID g6l0xqu with +15 score by [(FredMcCree, Reddit, 2020-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6l0xqu/) (in reply to ID izu5u3):\nJira is pretty great IMO.

Its a SAAS. It pleases corporate overlords, it integrates well, it's extremely flexible and customizable. There's a lot to be said about sending a help desk ticket over to development for triage without having to do anything but click a button (well, click, then make sure the fields migrate, click two or three more times, and then hope it doesn't fail during the move 🤦‍♀️).\n\nI've had to host and care for it in the past. That was enough to turn me off to it.\n\nI've built really complex workflows with it, and used it for very simple kanban. Even stripped down, it's still too complicated. The wealth of features tend to lead to practices that can be bad for overall productivity even if they look useful on the surface (sub-tasks, for example).\n\nI do like the UX/performance enhancements made in the last few years, but Atlasssian changes things too often, IMHO. \n\nI was bummed when I heard Atlasssian bought Trello. I love Trello. It's been getting a little bloated with features, but it was about perfect for most projects - 3 or 4 columns, flags, maybe stickers, rich text and you're cracking to get stuff done. Simple notifications, good mobile app, it's about perfect.

On the other extreme, subtasks can be trivial things that don't need to be enumerated, so its just noise. So subtasks make it easy to hide work, or make something look more complex than it is, and that kills velocity. Its hard or counter-intuitive to work on subtasks in parallel, which limits the effectiveness of a team.\n\nThis is in my experience, anyway. I have used subtasks for certain things like operations processes so I don't forget steps and can let someone else pick up the work easily. I've found adding a list in the description does the same job and doesn't clutter up the board with issues. Thats another thing - when we've used subtasks they make the board harder to look at - you can easily loose context in certain views (this is configurable and customizable but that's the gross/great thing about Jira).\n\n## Comment ID g6ljfla with +8 score by [(rafuzo2, Reddit, 2020-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6ljfla/) (in reply to ID izu5u3):\nIt’s like democracy: the worst form of government, except for all the others\n\n## Comment ID g6l65fg with +3 score by [(underdaawg, Reddit, 2020-09-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6l65fg/) (in reply to ID izu5u3):\nWhat do you like?

The prior software we used was very friendly to those of us in Business Controls and Operations as a database of prior tickets, outcomes, etc for effective management of business control issues, etc - but now with Jira, getting access to projects and different tickets is so convoluted and segmented, I gave up on it. I have access to main Jira, but apparently, I need to be given access to every project or ticket created to be able to look at anything. Now, when someone asks me anything about tickets for remediation efforts or business control reasons, I just tell them to reach out to tech. Its really bad now because we have no idea what issues have already been submitted, are being worked on, what the outcome was, etc- we are flying blind. Im sure duplicate issues submitted as defects have gone up significantly since we started using this shit- but Im also sure no one is going to do squat about it.\n\n### Comment ID m2cnwkv with +1 score by [(purpurne, Reddit, 2024-12-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/m2cnwkv/) (in reply to ID ke92gt0):\nSounds like a big problem that can be solved with someone managing a spreadsheet.",

To move four service desks and issues, it was going to cost almost 15k-20k. Yea, no thanks. \n\nI ended up finding a site that in my opinion, looked super sketchy, but I figured just to try it out as they have a free demo migration. It's a place called Help Desk Migration or HDM. They're based out of Europe, and happily signed an NDA for us as well. Their support was great, and the product works. It's basically some self setup and hooking in both sites via API, and I think the migration of all of our issues (about 45k issues) costs us like, maybe $3k total. Huge difference.  They can also customize your migration for an additional cost if you're only looking to bring certain issues over.  Happy to answer any additional questions about them.  They also have some great docs on all the requirements needed to make sure things come over correctly.\n\nI'm sure there are other ways to do it, like CSV, but HDM was a low enough cost and easy enough to set up that it was worth it imo to avoid the headache of making sure things like attachments and comments came over correctly.\n\nhttps://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1218501/freshdesk-to-jira-service-management?tab=overview&hosting=cloud\n\n### Comment ID hd7y555 with +2 score by [(duanco, Reddit, 2021-09-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/atlassian/comments/ppt6g9/freshdesk_to_jira_service_desk/hd7y555/) (in reply to ID hd69w4b):\nsimiliar boat here recently, as above came across HDM and honestly was excellent.

It is a piece of Software you can install on your computer and on a server.

Basically they run the 'Git on Server' part I mentioned.\n\nAnother service, Github offers pretty much the same as Bit Bucket, maybe this is where your confusion came from.\n\nBoth Github and Bit Bucket offer more than just Git with Bit Bucket also offering Mercurial (another version control system) for example.\n\nAdditionally both services offer things like issue tracking and collaboration features.\n\n### Comment ID cnxdqpe with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2015-01-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2tb1lw/what_is_atlassians_relationship_with_git_i_know/cnxdqpe/) (in reply to ID cnxdlu5):\nI know that Atlassian has TFS integration with their issue tracking software Jira as well.\n\n#### Comment ID cnxed3a with +3 score by [(mzalewski, Reddit, 2015-01-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2tb1lw/what_is_atlassians_relationship_with_git_i_know/cnxed3a/) (in reply to ID cnxdqpe):\nAtlassian provides [quite a few tools](https://www.atlassian.com/software) that nicely integrate with each other.

Git is the underlying \"technology\" and doesn't *require* Github, Bitbucket, or anything along those lines.  Git runs on your local computer and gives you a way to version control your code (or other text).  Connecting that local repository with a remote one is a very good idea since it acts as a backup and allows other people to collaborate with you on the same code/text.  So now you need a place to *be* that remote location right?  That's where Github, Bitbucket, etc come in.  These services provide you a remote location to push and manage your code.  You can connect your local git repository with Github, OR BitBucket, OR other similar online services (Sourceforge, Google Code, Codebase, etc), but don't have to.    You can also host your own remote server if that makes more sense.  They have various pros and cons, for example Github is only free for public repositories - which works well for open source software but not so good for corporate projects - whereas Bitbucket offers private repos for free.\n\nThere are alternatives to git as well, Subversion and Mercurial for example.  They work in similar ways to git, but are different.  I've only ever used git so I can't really compare them.  But same deal with the online remote repo options, Bitbucket actually started as Mecurial only before also adding support for git, Sourceforge does all 3, etc.\n\n### Comment ID cnxiql5 with +2 score by [(cheddarben, Reddit, 2015-01-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2tb1lw/what_is_atlassians_relationship_with_git_i_know/cnxiql5/) (in reply to ID cnxgvaw):\nI figured it out... and I understand the difference between Git and GitHub.

It looks like /u/eagle_with_a_gun has clued you in on the differences and relationship between Bitbucket and Git, but I thought I'd elaborate a little bit more on our use of Git at Atlassian. \n\nFirst up, we're heavy users of Git internally. We had roughly 600 engineers last time I checked, and we all use branching Git workflows coupled with pull requests and continuous deployment to develop our software. After we migrated to Git en masse in 2010 from a mixture of SVN and Mercurial, we decided to write up our experiences and learnings in a Git microsite: https://atlassian.com/git - you can read a bit more about our workflows there. The microsite also contains a huge amount of SVN->Git migration documentation and tooling, as we end-of-life'd our hosted SVN offering around the same time and migrated all of our customers to either Bitbucket or self-hosted SVN (the vast majority chose the former). \n\nBut we're not just users of Git, we also maintain a plethora products that are built on top of it:\n\n- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), our SaaS Git & Mercurial hosting service\n- [Stash](https://www.atlassian.com/software/stash), our self-hosted Git server\n- [SourceTree](http://sourcetreeapp.com/), our free Git client for OS X & Windows\n- [Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo), our continuous integration & deployment server with special support for git branching and merging\n- [FishEye](https://www.atlassian.com/software/fisheye), our self-hosted cross-SCM (Git/Hg/SVN/CVS/Perforce) code analysis & browsing tool \n- [Crucible](https://www.atlassian.com/software/crucible), our self-hosted iterative peer code review tool\n\nHence we spend a lot of time thinking, writing and playing with Git.

I recently joined a company (second dev who was hired) who has always outsourced their dev work but then want to bring it in house.  I was tasked to setup the whole devops process. I've always dabbled in a little bit of dev ops but now I'm truly getting into it and am going with a cloud solution. I might not be a true devops guy as some other people in here but I just need some advice on how I should move forward.\n\nWe are going to be a .NET shop for sure and we will go forward with .NET Core for sure. We will probably develop some services in other langauge stacks but .NET what not but .NET will be our mainstay. My manager has started off the company with Atlassian cloud and personnel (not IT) have started using Confluence and JIRA already.  So there's alot of documentation and project planning (for existing projects) have already been done. The internal software team is rebuilding something from scratch with the stuff this company recently outsourced.   \nMy boss said he's set on using Atlassian cloud (JIRA and confluence)  but Bitbucket isn't something he has committed on yet. I really don't see a point to going with staying in the Atlassian ecosystem when we are going to be a .NET shop and all 2 devs we have so far are familiar with microsoft and TFS.  I believe we as the dev team who is doing something from scratch should have free reign to go with doing everything in Azure Devops because the devs are familiar with microsoft already and we are doing .NET core stuff. The dockerization and orchestration integration seems better in Azure as well if we choose to go down that road.    \n\n\nI am currently doing a comparison with feature sets between the two clouds so i have some justiifcation for my manager. What if he says we cna just go with Bitbucket and just use te Azure Pipelines? What if we just use bitbucket pipelines and just deploy to host our application on Azure cloud? Like all of this is super confusing and kind of giving me a headache.  Is it possible to use a combination of Atlassian Cloud and Azure devops? One thing I truly forsee being a pain point in the future is traceability of work becuase the PM side will be in one and the dev side will be in another. We have to stay really diligent on keeping things updated.    \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Comment ID e7za3gw with +32 score by [(Resquid, Reddit, 2018-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/9p5lxa/deciding_on_atlassian_cloud_vs_azure_devops/e7za3gw/) (in reply to ID 9p5lxa):\nTIL Azure literally has a product called \"DevOps\"\n\nJesus Christ... smh\n\n### Comment ID e7zhywf with +2 score by [(monkh, Reddit, 2018-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/9p5lxa/deciding_on_atlassian_cloud_vs_azure_devops/e7zhywf/) (in reply to ID e7za3gw):\nAll the videos I've seen they always call it Azure Dev Ops never just Dev Ops.\n\n## Comment ID e7zto2x with +6 score by [(WarWizard, Reddit, 2018-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/9p5lxa/deciding_on_atlassian_cloud_vs_azure_devops/e7zto2x/) (in reply to ID 9p5lxa):\nMan; I was hoping for something better in this thread... but we have a lot of opinions and not a lot of data backing them up.\n\nI have been considering the same situation myself we are a .NET shop (MS partner), currently have on prem TFS. I have actually been looking at a bit of a hybrid approach. I like the way TFS does builds; and as a MS shop it just makes sense. I don't feel the strong need to have every single bit of the tool chain \"integrated\". That said; a little bit of integration is nice and does provide value IMO; if not take to extremes anyway.\n\nOf all of the similar \"work management\" type of tools -- I seem to like the way Jira does it the best. Confluence looks like it'll be an amazing addition to our company in terms of making documentation easy to create and easy to consume.\n\nCurrently I think we'll go with Documentation, task management, and some road map/planning with Jira and have VCS, Build, deploy in VSTS/ADO. We self-host our software internally; so we'll likely always have on prem build servers/agents for TFS.\n\nBased on what I have found; the issues people have with Jira tend to be from trying to over-complicate their processes and then force the tools to do that thing. We've been using trello with some post-build scripts to create release notes from cards, etc for a few years now and it works smoothly. The next jump we need to make is getting everything easily viewable across multiple teams and projects and get some roadmap planning (Portfolio for Jira). My intent is to go in without a heap of add-ons and plug ins and use as much of vanilla Jira as I can.\n\nThe rest of the build process I am comfortable/confident in VSTS/ADO to handle the way we need it to.\n\n### Comment ID e8029en with +1 score by [(kq21, Reddit, 2018-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/9p5lxa/deciding_on_atlassian_cloud_vs_azure_devops/e8029en/) (in reply to ID e7zto2x):\nHow do u guys deal with traceability with PM side and the work being done by the devs?

If you want that; sure you'll probably want to go all in on one or the other.

At my last company, we were a .NET shop using Jira, Confluence (both cloud), BitBucket (on prem/datacenter), TeamCity for builds (on prem), and Artifactory (on prem) for artifact management.\n\nRecently I've been using Azure DevOps for a new company, and I'm the administrator/setter upper. I'm not an Azure DevOps expert, but IMO it's not great. The Jira/Confluence/BitBucket/TeamCity/Artifactory tooling was better. Of all the parts in my previous developer toolchain, I'm pretty confident in saying that all of those tools are best-of-breed, except for Artifactory.\n\nSpecifically, I'm not a fan of the Azure DevOps issue/work item tracking - IMO it's not at all intuitive, and there doesn't seem to be much of an issue workflow, as Jira supports. The different boards required to view stories, bugs, and tasks is confusing (to me) - why can't I view all of the above on a single board? While I don't love Jira either (much of the administration schema is really old in the tooth, so there's a learning curve to setting it up well), the user experience for scrum masters, developers, PdMs, and QA in Jira is quite good. After testing many different issue tracking systems, at 2 different companies, Jira consistently came out on top. Azure DevOps just feels clunky and unproductive in comparison. My sense is that much of the issue tracking functionality in Azure DevOps Boards comes from legacy VSTS - it could be done much better with a re-write, but there are probably people out there who either know or depend on backward compatibility.\n\nAlso, there's no good wiki in Azure DevOps. Confluence is excellent - easy to author, organize, extend, and the search works well. In Azure DevOps, you can author markdown files in git - which is great for engineers, and as an engineer I like documentation as code - but it's not a good knowledgebase product that non-devs can maintain. The discussion board that exists on Confluence pages is also unmatched, as is the Confluence plugin model.\n\nAzure pipelines is ok - the cross-platform support is impressive, but IMO the usability of TeamCity is better.\n\nFor my current company (an early stage startup), the key points that are keeping me on Azure DevOps for the time being are:\n\n* It's free for up to 5 users. Jira/Confluence/BitBucket/TeamCity/Artifactory costs a decent amount more per month, whether you're a tiny company or a large company.\n* No parts of Azure DevOps are best of breed, but they're all integrated. You get integrated private Git repos, web based pull requests, issue tracking, git activity in your issues, a workable (markdown) wiki, and builds that automatically fire off on commits and merges. If I switched to Jira/Confluence/BitBucket/TeamCity/Artifactory I'd have to integrate them all.\n* The Azure DevOps git implementation is decent relative to BitBucket - it's not clearly worse (so far)\n* I haven't used the Azure DevOps artifact implementation yet, so I can't comment on a comparison to Artifactory\n* Azure DevOps integrates easily with Office365 (if you're using it) and/or Azure Active Directory for user management - that's something else I'd have to setup going to Jira/Confluence/BitBucket/TeamCity/Artifactory. I think I'd have to setup Atlassian Crowd to use Azure Active Directory users + credentials in Jira/Confluence/BitBucket.\n* Azure DevOps build agents can run on Linux, Windows, or MacOS. Azure pipelines isn't great (relative to TeamCity), and it's slow (relative to on-prem build servers), but the fact that you don't have to setup new build servers or public cloud resources is nice.\n* It's likely that the deploy story from Azure DevOps to Azure (if you're using it) is easier than from a self-hosted build server to Azure\n\nTLDR: Azure DevOps isn't great, but if you're using Office 365 and Azure, the integration between all the different functional areas is a breeze. Integrating a bunch of disparate dev tools (particularly user identity and links between them) is a bunch of work.\n\nWhile I say \"Azure DevOps isn't great\", I mostly give it low marks for the areas that overlap with Jira and Confluence. The other services within Azure DevOps are decent.\n\nFor my part, I'll be keeping tabs on the extent that using Azure DevOps boards is hurting productivity (and moral) relative to using Jira; and the extent to which we \"need\" a product like Confluence. If it gets bad enough, I'll start using Jira and Confluence, and tackle the identity integration project, and the work of getting Azure DevOps git commits to show up in Jira issues, and other integration. My sense is that I'll stick with Azure DevOps git, pipelines, and artifacts, even after switching to Jira and Confluence.\n\nFor your specific situation, I would look at the fact that Jira and Confluence are already adopted as a blessing in disguise. Hopefully identity is done correctly. If that's the case, you can still use the other Azure DevOps features (which are decent), you just have to handle integrating them with Jira and Confluence. That will probably require licensing a third-party plugin or service.\n\n### Comment ID ee407h6 with +2 score by [(SleeplessinOslo, Reddit, 2019-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/9p5lxa/deciding_on_atlassian_cloud_vs_azure_devops/ee407h6/) (in reply to ID e9uvlht):\nThanks for this\n\n## Comment ID e7zlbko with +9 score by [(an-anarchist, Reddit, 2018-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/9p5lxa/deciding_on_atlassian_cloud_vs_azure_devops/e7zlbko/) (in reply to ID 9p5lxa):\nHaving used Atlassian Bitbucket and Bamboo (with the new pipelines as code) and also VSTS/Azure DevOps I would say Azure DevOps easily wins.

And Azure's 'serverless' functions are nothing but serverless, if you use any plan other than the stunted Consumption you have to pay 24/7 for the VMs your 'serverless' function runs on.\n\nPersonally if I had to suggest an approach I would use Azure DevOps and target AWS Lambda for deployment, as [it supports .NET 2.1](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/06/lambda-supports-dotnetcore-twopointone/) and it's a true serverless offering.\n\n### Comment ID e7ztpaa with +1 score by [(WarWizard, Reddit, 2018-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/9p5lxa/deciding_on_atlassian_cloud_vs_azure_devops/e7ztpaa/) (in reply to ID e7zlbko):\nFor OP; I think this makes a lot of sense.\n\n### Comment ID e8hgbre with +1 score by [(fortune102, Reddit, 2018-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/9p5lxa/deciding_on_atlassian_cloud_vs_azure_devops/e8hgbre/) (in reply to ID e7zlbko):\n>an-anarchist   \n>  \n>Could you please tell which boards you used?

Smaller shops/less sophisticated setups need less tools, that is true in any I.T. shop.\n\n## Comment ID e7zj0qw with +2 score by [(ICanOnlyPickOne, Reddit, 2018-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/9p5lxa/deciding_on_atlassian_cloud_vs_azure_devops/e7zj0qw/) (in reply to ID 9p5lxa):\nWhere are you going to be deploying your software to?

I come from a confluence, jira, bitbucket, teamcity and octopus background. My new role uses Azure DevOps and I was pleasantly surprised how Azure DevOps is all there out of the box. I’m pretty sure Azure DevOps is free for Visual Studio enterprise accounts too!\n\nMy suggestion would be to setup a free account (5 users are allowed on the free plan either Microsoft Live or Azure AD accounts) setup 2FA and use the Agile board (to replace Jira), Wiki (to replace confluence) and do some testing. I think you’ll find Azure DevOps pretty good at how fast it is to build out a deployment pipeline to Azure Cloud or AWS. (GCP seems to have no love). It can also deploy into onprem too.\n\n### Comment ID e7zipph with +2 score by [(rdns98, Reddit, 2018-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/9p5lxa/deciding_on_atlassian_cloud_vs_azure_devops/e7zipph/) (in reply to ID e7zamsl):\nSame here.

      "# Post ID jj1efi: Is Gitlab a suitable \"Atlassian Suite\" replacement? with +23 score by [(guernica88, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/)\nAs a company we deal with ITAR controlled data and therefor cannot use the majority of cloud based products. This includes Atlassian cloud products which is why we've been using their onprem products. Obviously they've announced a discontinuation of those products.\n\nSo I'm looking into suitable replacements and Gitlab has caught my eye. I have a couple of questions that I thought might be easier answered by the community though as we aren't only working on software in the system.\n\n1. Confluence? We use confluence to host several sections. Some groups use it to develop their procedures and helpful tips. Our sysadmin use it as a \"Knowledgebase\" where they store lots of articles they've written for themselves on how to deal with tricky hardware or very specialized equipment. They also have things like onboarding and offboarding procedures in there\n\n2. General ticketing system. We use the ticketing system in Jira for everything. Our sysadmin tickets go through here as well as our engineers have tickets in here. These two portions are completely devoid of any code and make no use of repositories. Will we be able to setup ticketing \"sections\" for these that follow a workflow. Workflow is very important to our engineers and they can be somewhat complicated moving from status to status and needing certain qualifications to be able to move to next steps.\n\n3. Those are the two big ones, but beyond that I see that there is supported migration from Jira to GitLab so I was wondering if anyone comments on their experience moving from Atlassian Suite to Gitlab. The three main products we use are Jira, Confluence, Fisheye and Bitbucket.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read!\n\n## Comment ID ga9w13d with +11 score by [(tehBarrow, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/ga9w13d/) (in reply to ID jj1efi):\nYou can replace Bitbucket, Bamboo and possibly JIRA with GitLab (and sort of fisheye then). Replacing JIRA mostly depends on how deep down the rabbit hole you have gone with JIRA, ticketing in GitLab is simpler and it is not possible to configure in the same ways as JIRA can be, this can actually a good thing in the long run.\n\nConfluence is sort of unique and possibly best in class when combined with JIRA, GitLab has pages but that is not really a replacement for Confluence. You can however use GitLab and write knowledge articles in markdown files and place it in a  knowledgebase repository and use some Hugo site template to expose them (via pages), can become pretty nice actually. I have seen many teams create very nice and easily searched KB sites that way.\n\nYou need to have a repo or group for tickets, call one sysadmin or helpdesk and you are fine. Workflow is however non-existent, any ticket can be moved to any column without any stops and tickets do not really have a status. You can use labels to simulate this though.\n\nNo idea on the migration, git is always git, so that should not be an issue.\n\n### Comment ID gaai2bk with +9 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/gaai2bk/) (in reply to ID ga9w13d):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID gaamqzl with +3 score by [(lps2, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/gaamqzl/) (in reply to ID gaai2bk):\nCorrect and the wiki is itself a repo\n\n#### Comment ID gaann6h with +3 score by [(tehBarrow, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/gaann6h/) (in reply to ID gaai2bk):\nYeah, but compared to confluence it is pretty weak.\n\n### Comment ID ga9zutn with +3 score by [(guernica88, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/ga9zutn/) (in reply to ID ga9w13d):\nHmmm no custom workflows for issues may actually be a deal breaker.

If people are treating it like Sharepoint and piling files into it, that didn’t feel as polished. They did improve the storage implementation recently so that should be better. Personally not having to deal with Confluence’s wiki syntax is worth a lot but I’d definitely see what your target users think about it since that’s an easy point of friction.\n\n### Comment ID ga9vz6a with +2 score by [(guernica88, Reddit, 2020-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/comments/jj1efi/is_gitlab_a_suitable_atlassian_suite_replacement/ga9vz6a/) (in reply to ID ga9vklc):\nOk looks like Confluence may be where I should focus my research. Our engineers do kind of use it as a versioning system for some of their documents/procedures.

The first is wikis - GitLab has Project and Group wikis that are similar to confluence. They use markdown and are pretty good.  \n\n\nThe second route is GitLab Pages - With GitLab Pages you can easily setup a website that is hosted with GitLab. It's extremely low maintenance and gives you tons of control.

We use confluence in-house (and we use it with comala publishing to handle the versioning stuff you mention) and it works well, but I'd definitely agree with some of the other folks in this post saying that it may be over complicated for what's necessary these days (we've been using it for \\~6 years now).\n\nEdit: remove unrelated quote"

In my time there, I went through 2 re-orgs and 3 managers. It just always felt like being on a hamster wheel… in a hurricane. Today I received an email 7 weeks after I was laid off that started with, “ Congrats on your first year at Atlassian—we know that's a huge accomplishment and are beyond thrilled to be celebrating with you!” It was a bummer to receive that, to say the least, but it included a link to leave this Glassdoor review to “ help provide invaluable insight to future candidates and help us to improve your experience as an employee continually.” so here I am. My advice is to do proper change management of your automated emails when you layoff 5% of your workforce so that emails like this aren’t sent to hard working former employees that you eliminated congratulating them on a milestone they never reached. I know this wasn’t intentional, but it hurt.",

People feel insecure and under extreme stress, but stay because of the good pay.\n\n- Reorgs are commonplace. In the past year alone, I had five different managers, and the team's direction changed multiple times.\n- Stack-ranking occurs every six months, fostering a toxic culture where employees leave meaningless comments on PRs just to boost their PR count and appear active.\n- People constantly seek ways to inflate their metrics, forcing you to compete for opportunities. Otherwise, your metrics will fall behind—meaning you may have to stay online at 9 PM to submit another PR or send a Slack message at 2:00 AM (literally).\n- Changing teams is difficult because everyone wants to switch teams.\n- Frequent distractions due to constant logins and re-logins across different tools, with little consistency between them.\n- Excessive red tape everywhere.\n- If you're on a core team, you'll receive numerous requests from other teams to modify your codebase for library upgrades and other changes.\n- Slow development loop, especially when working with Jira, which has many issues when running locally.\n- Promotions are extremely difficult to achieve.",

But, if the “leadership” is a few months late to provide an update we’re only told that “they’re working on it”. The same applies to the company's abrupt transition from extremely aggressive hiring to lay-offs within a two month period, there was no acknowledgement of potential errors that may have occurred. - In the past few months, the executives' tone of voice has shifted to somewhat passive-aggressive. Sure, it’s difficult macroeconomic conditions, but there’s better ways to communicate that we need to switch strategy. At least for the organisation that Atlassian was aspiring to be. - A lot of toxic positivity, especially from the middle managers. Every re-org is celebrated like it was the the best decision ever. It's especially annoying with more challenging announcements like purging the Development Manager role. - Your career and overall well-being are heavily dependent on your direct manager. If you're fortunate, you have the potential to advance significantly, but if you're unlucky, you'll experience a burnout. And too many good people have become miserable because of bad managers at Atlassian. It’s basically impossible to escalate a conflict with your manager.",

It’s truly an art form here. If you're not on a PIP, are you even really working? The company’s commitment to ensuring everyone feels the thrill of living on the edge is truly admirable. It's like a rite of passage—every month brings a fresh wave of anxiety and excitement. Who needs job security when you can have constant, gut-wrenching uncertainty?\n\nNow, about the PR count. Atlassian has managed to turn code reviews into a competitive sport. Forget about writing clean, functional code. It’s all about the numbers, baby! Your worth here is measured in pull requests like you’re a racehorse on a track. The more, the better, right? Never mind if the quality suffers—what’s important is hitting that next PR milestone. And, oh, the thrill of having your PR comments count scrutinized as if each one were a personal reflection of your professional worth!\n\nAnd let’s not forget the working environment. The long hours and relentless pace make it feel like you’re in a corporate version of The Hunger Games. Survival of the fittest becomes your daily mantra as you navigate through a battlefield of endless tasks and shifting priorities. It’s a test of endurance where every day feels like a quest to avoid the next corporate elimination.\n\nIn summary, if you’re looking for a job where you can feel perpetually on edge, where your every PR is tallied and analyzed, and where the work environment resembles a high-stakes survival game, Atlassian is your dream destination.",

When times got tough, the values were jettisoned and new people were brought in who’ve driven it further into the ground. Senior Meta and Amazon hires have been the worst thing for the company. People creating personal fiefdoms and just driving good people out. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, Atlassian always had problems, but they were more about a culture of shipping barely functional MVPs and moving on to the next thing. And the reorgs… It was like a dog spotting squirrels every five minutes. But it was worth it because the people were great and really tried to live the values. That’s gone now and there’s very little left to like.\n\nNew programs are rolled out and, when people inevitably complain about the tin-eared approach, the response is “trust us, bruh.”",

People that I worked with were welcoming and truly living the Atlassian values.\n\nOvertime, the culture turned backwards, no more recharge days and they introduced more and more performance metrics to measure us against each other. People are more anxious and in a race to increase their PR counts. There is also a strong focus on proving your individual contributions, hence we need to constantly collect evidences on our work and impact. All of this combine leads to a never ending burn out. \n\nIf you already in a job that you enjoy and considering Atlassian, I would advise to really rethink if the salary and advertised benefits are really worth your mental health. Also the benefit policies are constantly changing, so they might not be as great in the coming future.",

Performance measurement is driven by arbitrary numbers rather than meaningful contributions.\n\nStack Ranking &amp; Internal Competition – Employees are forced into a rigid ranking system that encourages unhealthy competition instead of collaboration. Leadership actively pits individuals and teams against each other, prioritizing internal optics over actual value.\n\nNo Agency – Tech decisions are not driven by long-term strategy or market needs but by internal politics and internal marketing. Initiatives are abandoned at any time based on leadership optics. Addressing tech debt is nearly impossible without risking career stagnation or worse.\n\nCustomer Focus is Superficial – Many longstanding issues with high customer demand remain ignored while efforts shift toward PR-friendly initiatives.\n\nGrowth is a Moving Target – Promotions and career advancement are inconsistent and based more on optics, timing, and internal politics than merit.",

Previously, I felt comfortable openly sharing my opinions and ideas. However, I now find myself hesitating to speak up due to concerns about potential retaliation from individuals involved in the calibration process.\n\nBuild with heart and balance\nThe emphasis on impact-driven performance indicators has led to a tendency for teams to push changes without fully considering risks and quality. It has become common for teams to bypass the exploration of alternatives and thorough evaluations, which are essential for selecting the best solutions. Additionally, the PR count metric is toxic. People starts to split a single PR into multiple ones and leaving arbitrary comments on others' PRs solely to inflate the metric.\n\nPlay, as a team\nThe company was once a place that fostered collaboration, enabling teams to unlock their full potential by working together. However, with recent cultural shifts, the focus has shifted towards individual competition, where team members are incentivized to maximize their impact to secure better performance review outcomes. This shift has led to a heightened emphasis on outperforming peers to avoid falling into the bottom 10% of the performance ranking, rather than prioritizing collective success.\n\nBe the change you seek\nI no longer feel confident using the 20% innovation time to explore new ideas, as the risk of failure is too high. Any time spent on initiatives that do not generate immediate impact is seen as wasted, which negatively affects my performance review. As a result, the opportunity for creativity and experimentation has significantly diminished.\n\nDon’t #@!% the customer\nThe customer is not a priority to the engineers in this company anymore, especially to the teams don't face customers directly. In order to create impacts for the performance review, it is common to rewrite a working service in a totally different way in the name of \"better performance\", \"lower cost\". But do customers feel the benefit? I doubt it. Do customers stop complaining Jira is too slow on cloud?",

For example, Engineering EA experience may be vastly different from Sales and Marketing EA - even though all roll up to the same cost center, just different management and oversight. They are working to improve this. The ramp up to onboarding is supposed to be 2-4 weeks before start the role (doing the work) and some get thrown into the fire faster, depending on leader, needs and fires to put out. Recent change in 2025 to benefits sharing, employees will start contributing to health benefits (really cool they didn't used to) but will now have employees take part in costs sharing. Its minimal but still sad to see it go away, but understandable. Travel for EA's can also vary by team and Leaders needs, so this is a bit all over the place.

Nobody feels safe about their job.\nAs a senior individual contributor, my performance was meant to be measured in terms of \"impact\", which is only vaguely defined.\nThis translates into senior engineers launching all kinds of useless, or even harmful projects, just so they can claim they made such an impact.\nUnfortunately, I found myself with a clueless manager, who, three months into the job, told me I would have been let go because of \"lack of impact\".\nI wonder what kind of impact he expected in such a short time at a complex company like Atlassian, but he never clarified.\nI tried to prove myself in many ways, but it was never enough, or the right way.\nHe never helped me understand how I could have been more effective. Instead, at every 1-1, he always expressed his disappointment, with no constructive feedback whatsoever.\nOne of their core values is \"Play, as a team\", which is funny, because it should be \"Everyone for themselves\".",

In my time there, I went through 2 re-orgs and 3 managers. It just always felt like being on a hamster wheel… in a hurricane. Today I received an email 7 weeks after I was laid off that started with, “ Congrats on your first year at Atlassian—we know that's a huge accomplishment and are beyond thrilled to be celebrating with you!” It was a bummer to receive that, to say the least, but it included a link to leave this Glassdoor review to “ help provide invaluable insight to future candidates and help us to improve your experience as an employee continually.” so here I am. My advice is to do proper change management of your automated emails when you layoff 5% of your workforce so that emails like this aren’t sent to hard working former employees that you eliminated congratulating them on a milestone they never reached.

But, if the “leadership” is a few months late to provide an update we’re only told that “they’re working on it”. The same applies to the company's abrupt transition from extremely aggressive hiring to lay-offs within a two month period, there was no acknowledgement of potential errors that may have occurred. - In the past few months, the executives' tone of voice has shifted to somewhat passive-aggressive. Sure, it’s difficult macroeconomic conditions, but there’s better ways to communicate that we need to switch strategy. At least for the organisation that Atlassian was aspiring to be. - A lot of toxic positivity, especially from the middle managers. Every re-org is celebrated like it was the the best decision ever. It's especially annoying with more challenging announcements like purging the Development Manager role. - Your career and overall well-being are heavily dependent on your direct manager. If you're fortunate, you have the potential to advance significantly, but if you're unlucky, you'll experience a burnout.

When times got tough, the values were jettisoned and new people were brought in who’ve driven it further into the ground. Senior Meta and Amazon hires have been the worst thing for the company. People creating personal fiefdoms and just driving good people out. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, Atlassian always had problems, but they were more about a culture of shipping barely functional MVPs and moving on to the next thing. And the reorgs… It was like a dog spotting squirrels every five minutes. But it was worth it because the people were great and really tried to live the values.

It’s truly an art form here. If you're not on a PIP, are you even really working? The company’s commitment to ensuring everyone feels the thrill of living on the edge is truly admirable. It's like a rite of passage—every month brings a fresh wave of anxiety and excitement. Who needs job security when you can have constant, gut-wrenching uncertainty?\n\nNow, about the PR count. Atlassian has managed to turn code reviews into a competitive sport. Forget about writing clean, functional code. It’s all about the numbers, baby! Your worth here is measured in pull requests like you’re a racehorse on a track. The more, the better, right? Never mind if the quality suffers—what’s important is hitting that next PR milestone. And, oh, the thrill of having your PR comments count scrutinized as if each one were a personal reflection of your professional worth!\n\nAnd let’s not forget the working environment. The long hours and relentless pace make it feel like you’re in a corporate version of The Hunger Games. Survival of the fittest becomes your daily mantra as you navigate through a battlefield of endless tasks and shifting priorities. It’s a test of endurance where every day feels like a quest to avoid the next corporate elimination.\n\nIn summary, if you’re looking for a job where you can feel perpetually on edge, where your every PR is tallied and analyzed, and where the work environment resembles a high-stakes survival game, Atlassian is your dream destination.",

Previously, I felt comfortable openly sharing my opinions and ideas. However, I now find myself hesitating to speak up due to concerns about potential retaliation from individuals involved in the calibration process.\n\nBuild with heart and balance\nThe emphasis on impact-driven performance indicators has led to a tendency for teams to push changes without fully considering risks and quality. It has become common for teams to bypass the exploration of alternatives and thorough evaluations, which are essential for selecting the best solutions. Additionally, the PR count metric is toxic. People starts to split a single PR into multiple ones and leaving arbitrary comments on others' PRs solely to inflate the metric.\n\nPlay, as a team\nThe company was once a place that fostered collaboration, enabling teams to unlock their full potential by working together. However, with recent cultural shifts, the focus has shifted towards individual competition, where team members are incentivized to maximize their impact to secure better performance review outcomes. This shift has led to a heightened emphasis on outperforming peers to avoid falling into the bottom 10% of the performance ranking, rather than prioritizing collective success.\n\nBe the change you seek\nI no longer feel confident using the 20% innovation time to explore new ideas, as the risk of failure is too high. Any time spent on initiatives that do not generate immediate impact is seen as wasted, which negatively affects my performance review. As a result, the opportunity for creativity and experimentation has significantly diminished.\n\nDon’t #@!% the customer\nThe customer is not a priority to the engineers in this company anymore, especially to the teams don't face customers directly. In order to create impacts for the performance review, it is common to rewrite a working service in a totally different way in the name of \"better performance\", \"lower cost\".

If you are an Atlassian Creator, jump in the comments and let people know what you make content about and where they can find you.\n\nHave a great rest of the week everyone!",
      "# [The *new* Jira is here by Atlassian, Dave Meyer on 2024-10-18](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/the-new-jira)\nAt Team ‘24 in Las Vegas, we unveiled the next evolution of Jira – a shared place for every team to align on goals and priorities, track and collaborate on work, and get the insights they need to build something incredible, together.\n\nToday, we’re excited to announce new features (and a new look!) that make Jira easier, more flexible, and more powerful for all types of work – helping transform siloed companies into connected ones.\n\nLet’s take a look!\n\nMore flexibility, for more teams\n\nNo matter the team you’re on, Jira embraces the little things that make teams unique, while keeping you connected to the people, plans and information you need to deliver great work together.\n\nLet’s check out the new ways Jira is bringing more flexibility and customization to support any team’s work style.\n\nImproved navigation, customized for you\n\nSoon we’ll be rolling out a new, customizable navigation experience that brings the most relevant work to your fingertips. From goals, to plans, to projects, and more, a new sidebar gives you quick and easy access to the most important information from your team and across the company. Plus you can personalize it! Reorder items by importance, pin relevant work, and hide what you don’t need.\n\nAlong with the new sidebar, we’re also introducing a simplified top navigation that brings AI-powered search front and center. AI-powered search helps surface the most relevant information from across Jira, Confluence, and other Atlassian apps. That means less time wasted hunting things down, and more time to get s#!t done.\n\nWe think you’ll love this simplified navigation so much, we’re rolling it out across all Atlassian products for a consistent experience.\n\nMore pieces of flair\n\nWish Jira better reflected your team spirit? With new background colors, images, and card covers, now your team can truly make Jira feel like home. Personalize Jira to reflect your team vibes (we’re more of a cute dogs-in-hats kind of team).\n\nSpeaking of flair, we also added a confetti cannon to celebrate any time you move a work item to done.\n\nNo more issues\n\nNot every thing you work on is an issue (anymore). With more teams making Jira their home for work, we’re retiring ‘issues’ as our default name for work in Jira. Instead of referring to ‘issues,’ you choose how you refer to your work – whether that’s a “launch”, a “task” or even an “issue”.\n\nCustom project templates to scale your team’s way of working\n\nFor scaling enterprises, consistency is key. With custom project templates (one of Jira’s most requested features), soon you’ll be able to create reusable project templates for your organization with pre-configured workflows, automations, fields, permissions, and more. With custom project templates, it’s easy to scale processes you want to standardize – from marketing campaigns, to HR onboarding processes, and more.\n\nMaking AI work for Jira users\n\nAtlassian Intelligence (AI) in Jira empowers teams to be their best. Here are a few new AI-powered features in Jira that will enable teams to work smarter.\n\nSave time creating work items\n\nWith AI work creation, easily identify and create work in Jira right from a Confluence page. Just highlight the text and AI will suggest a task that you can create directly from the page. And soon, AI work creation will be even more powerful. You will be able to create single work items from Slack messages, or even use AI to scan an entire Confluence page for action items and bulk transform them into multiple work items.\n\nAutomatically create work items from Loom video\n\nMore of a visual communicator? With Loom AI workflows, you can easily turn any Loom recording into a work item in Jira. Simply record a Loom, click “create an issue,” and Loom AI will generate a detailed work item for your Jira project based on the video transcript. Now you can go from unstructured thought to structured work in seconds.\n\nBreak down work in a click\n\nWith Jira’s new work breakdown feature, AI helps you break down large projects into individual tasks automatically. Simply create a work item and AI will recommend relevant subtasks that you can approve in a click! Now you can spend less time breaking work down, and more time moving work forward.\n\nStay aligned every step of the way\n\nYour engineers, marketers, designers, and other teams may all work differently, but they should still be aligned to shared objectives. Bringing every team into Jira makes it easier for leaders to set goals, align teams to priorities, and track the success of every project in flight.\n\nGoals, everywhere\n\nPreviewed earlier this year, Goals are now generally available in Jira. Broader availability across Atlassian is in early access, with a full rollout to all customers in the coming months (opt-in here). To help keep your priorities front and center, Goals can be viewed in the list, timeline, calendar, and issue views. You can also now filter by Goals.\n\nThis one’s for you, program managers\n\nWe’re also introducing a new board view within Plans called the program board. This new, drag-and-drop interface allows you to coordinate a program of work and its dependencies across multiple teams on a customizable cadence.\n\nYour next great idea starts with Jira\n\nWe can’t wait for you to check out the new ways we’re making Jira easier, more powerful, and more flexible for every team’s working style.\n\nWith all teams on the same tool, and on the same page, building something incredible together has never been easier.",

This in my case is placing a reference document on a related ticket. Right now the link is viewable and is clickable, but it shows the full URL for a confluence page which is looooong and I would like this to look similar to what you can do with an HREF tag in HTML.

      "# [Atlassian Cloud changes Jul 29 to Aug 5, 2024](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/blog/2024/08/atlassian-cloud-changes-jul-29-to-aug-5-2024)\nThese changes have recently been rolled out to Atlassian Cloud sites.\n\nChanges labeled ROLLING OUT are being gradually rolled out and may not be on your site just yet.\n\nAtlassian Administration\n\nAtlassian Administration is where you manage your Atlassian organization, including user access to products, security settings, and billing preferences.\n\nChoose to get Atlassian experiments for your organization\n\nROLLING OUT NEW THIS WEEK\n\nExperiments are Atlassian changes in development. We gather data on these changes to determine if they’re ready to release to all organizations.\n\nFor organizations with an Enterprise plan, you can choose to get experiments so you can influence Atlassian's product development through testing. Or prevent experiments rolling out to your organization because you need to ensure changes are planned for ahead of time.\n\nLearn about Atlassian experiments\n\nFilter the user list with added roles\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve updated the users list in the Atlassian Administration Directory. You can now filter the user list by new roles that have been split into multiple dropdown menus instead of one.\n\nThe roles we’re introducing include:\n\nCompass basic\n\nJira Service Management stakeholder and customer\n\nJira Product Discovery contributor\n\nTo filter the user list by roles:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Directory > Users.\n\nFrom the Role field, select the role you’d like to filter by.\n\nThis change only applies to user list filters for centralized user management. Learn more about the centralized user management\n\nMake it easy and secure for customers to log in to your help center with single sign-on\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you connect an identity provider to your Jira Service Management site, you can authenticate your customers with SAML single sign-on (SSO).\n\nBefore you begin\n\nYou must subscribe to Atlassian Access from your organization before you set up SAML single sign-on. Learn more about how to start with Atlassian Access\n\nTo set up SAML SSO for portal-only customers:\n\nGo to Settings > Products.\n\nUnder Jira Service Management, select Authentication.\n\nSelect Add identity provider.\n\nFollow the prompts to complete the setup.\n\nLearn more about SAML single sign-on for portal-only customers\n\nBrand your Jira products with a custom domain\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now use custom domains to brand your Jira products. Custom domains provide easy-to-remember URLs for your users to access your products.\n\nYou can create a custom domain if you have a Jira Premium or Jira Service Management Standard plan.\n\nPreviously, this feature was only available for Jira Service Management help center. Tell me more about custom domains\n\nTo create a custom domain:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Products > Product URLs.\n\nSelect Add custom domain. This is only visible if you have an eligible product.\n\nReview the Before you add a custom domain page, and select Next.\n\nSelect which product you want to access from your custom domain.\n\nFollow the prompts to specify your domain. You’ll need to enter two subdomains and a domain.\n\nEnter a Redirect URL. This is optional.\n\nReview changes and select Create domain.\n\nConnect Microsoft Azure AD to Atlassian with an option that works for you\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you connect your Microsoft Azure AD identity provider to an Atlassian organization, you now have two options.\n\nOption 1: Manually set up user provisioning\n\nRecommended when you need:\n\nflexibility in setting up your Microsoft Azure Active Directory identity provider with SCIM and SAML\n\nto sync groups and users with no flattening of nested group structure\n\nto sync when you add users to your Azure AD\n\nLearn how to add an identity provider for this option\n\nOption 2: Automatically set up user provisioning\n\nRecommended when you need:\n\neasy set up by allowing access to groups and users in your Microsoft Azure Active Directory\n\nto flatten your nested group structure and keep group memberships\n\nto sync automatically (every 4 hours)\n\nLearn more about Azure AD for nested groups\n\nTo connect your identity provider:\n\n1. Go to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\n2. Select Security > Identity providers.\n\nLearn more about identity providers\n\nFind Atlassian Administration settings faster\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now avoid searching every page of the Atlassian administration looking for what you need. We’ve added a new search field. From this field, you can enter a top or left navigation page title and select the page you want from the results.\n\nTo use the Administration search field:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect the search field in the top right.\n\nEnter the page title.\n\nSelect the page you want.\n\nRetiring the possibility to manage the atlassian-addons-project-access role\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nFollowing up on our previous announcement, we’re planning to remove the possibility to manage the atlassian-addons-project-access role in two to six months. The exact date depends on the feedback we receive after this announcement.\n\nBy default, the role is assigned to all project permissions in permission schemes and all issue security levels in issue security schemes. As a result of this change, the possibility to manage that role’s permissions and issue security levels, both via the UI and the REST API, will be restricted.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the planned changes, please leave them under this public ticket.\n\nCreate custom domains for your Jira products\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe removed keyword restrictions when you create custom domains. You will no longer have a fixed list to select keywords for subdomains. Instead, you have the ability to manually enter your own subdomains.\n\nJira family products have also been given added support. You can now select Jira products from the dropdown menu when you create a custom domain.\n\nTo create a custom domain:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com.

You’ll need to enter two subdomains and a domain.\n\nEnter a Redirect URL. This is optional.\n\nReview changes and select Create domain.\n\nData residency for Marketplace apps\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen evaluating data residency for your apps, you might see some apps listed as \"No action available.\"\n\nThis means that some app partners declare that their apps don't need to be pinned or migrated because their apps exclusively store data within the Atlassian product. Another reason is that the apps may not store any data in the scope of the Marketplace partner's data residency policies.\n\nTo request a data residency move for your apps, you will have first to move your product. Learn more about how to move your product from one location to another\n\nOnce your product has been pinned to your selected location, you can move your eligible apps to the same location. Learn more about data residency for Marketplace apps\n\nStay on top of your organization’s security\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe improved the security guide so you can see your security setup in one place.\n\nUnderstand your organization’s mix of users and their login methods at a glance. Then, review your security recommendations to keep your users and data protected.\n\nTo go to the security guide:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security.\n\nCopy Confluence data: Move users related to spaces you want to copy\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you move data from one instance of your Confluence cloud to another, you can move spaces, and only users who contribute to the spaces.\n\nThis means that when you add or reorganize teams, you can move spaces and only the related users you want, instead of all users. This will help you copy data:\n\nin small chunks\n\nin multiple phases\n\nquicker and reduce your overall downtime.\n\nTo access this feature:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com.

Keep an eye on this page to stay up to date on what data is available to copy between cloud sites.\n\nCopying Jira Service Management data now lives in admin.atlassian.com, by selecting Settings, then Data management, then Copy product data.\n\nYou need to have organization admin permissions to access and use this feature.\n\nIntroducing limits to how many items you can add to an issue\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nTo enhance the reliability and efficiency of our platform, we’re introducing new limits to how many comments, attachments, and links you can add to an issue.\n\nResize your columns in the new issue navigator\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now resize columns in the issue navigator list view. To try it out, go to the issue navigator by selecting Issues in the project sidebar. Alternatively, select Filters in the navigation, then select View all issues.\n\nFrom the list view, drag the right border of a column to resize it. Alternatively, select the More actions (︙) menu on a table header, then select Resize column.\n\nAdditionally, we've updated the appearance of the list view, making it more modern, compact and easy to use.\n\nView parent, team, development and version information as columns\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou'll also be able to filter by team, parent and versions.\n\nTo view your new fields, scroll the list all the way to the right. You can then organize your fields how you like.\n\nTo view your new filters, select Filter at the top right of your list. They will be available in the menu.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nEdit issues easier and quicker by navigating updates just with your keyboard. We've also added new fields including team, parent, development and versions.\n\nTo edit an issue using only a keyboard:\n\nTo enter a value and move focus to the field on the right, press tab.\n\nTo enter a value and move focus to the field below, press enter.\n\nYour new fields will be shown in your list automatically. You can remove fields as you usually would.\n\nIt’s easier for people with Jira to start using Jira Product Discovery\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe know our products can be complicated. So now people who have Jira, and have recently also added Jira Product Discovery, will see simple recommendations on how to start using Jira Product Discovery. For example, inviting teammates, using a template, etc.\n\nThat means it’s easier to know what to do first in Jira Product Discovery so that you’re getting the most out of it.\n\nThe recommendations will show up in the ‘Your work’ part of Jira, and everyone with either a Free, Standard, or Premium plan will see them. You can dismiss them anytime so they stop showing up.\n\nCollapsible transition labels in the New Workflow Editor\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThis is the second small but mighty improvement to the workflow editor so your workflows are easier to read.\n\nThis change adds collapsible transition labels to the new workflow editor for both company-managed and team-managed projects. When you're managing workflows in the new editor, you can hide transition elements to reduce the amount of clutter on your screen. Oh, happy days!\n\nOther small but mighty changes to the workflow editor include:\n\nNew global transitions and lozenges in the New Workflow Editor\n\nNew shared transitions in the New Workflow Editor for company-managed projects\n\nRead our community post about these changes to learn more.\n\nNew global transitions and lozenges in the new workflow editor\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThis is the first small but mighty improvement to the workflow editor so your workflows are easier to read.\n\nThis change specifically targets workflows made using the old editor view. Through customers' feedback, we've heard that when these workflows are opened in the new editor view, they're often hard to read, misaligned, and generally not nice.\n\nTo solve this, we’ve updated how the global transitions and the status lozenges render in the new editor view. See the image for a before/after comparison.\n\nOther small but mighty changes to the workflow editor include:\n\nCollapsable transition labels in the New Workflow Editor\n\nNew shared transitions in the New Workflow Editor for company-managed projects\n\nRead our community post about these changes to learn more.\n\nTemplate recommendations in your Projects directory have a new home\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you click on ‘Projects’ in your top navigation in Jira you land in your Projects directory. Previously, recommended templates were listed at the top of this directory.\n\nNow, the templates we recommend sit to the side. You can display and hide them as before; the main difference is that when you hover over any of the templates, you can see a preview of what that template looks like and how it works.\n\nWe've also changed the logic behind the recommendations so that they’re more specific and useful.\n\nBringing Plans and Overviews together!\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re bringing together the best of Jira Software and Jira Work Management into a single project management tool, so all your teams now have a shared place to get sh*t done.\n\nAs of this release note, we're launching the migration of Overviews in Jira Work Management into Plans in Jira Software.\n\nFind out how this supercharges your planning experience\n\nUse Atlassian Intelligence to define words and acronyms in the issue description\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now use Atlassian Intelligence to define acronyms and one or more words in the issue description. The definitions will be based on information found in connected Confluence spaces.\n\nTo use Atlassian Intelligence to define words:\n\nMake sure the description is in view mode, not edit mode\n\nHighlight words you need defined\n\nSelect Define\n\nDefinitions are only available in view mode in the description.\n\nSimplifying the Toolchain settings page\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThe \"Toolchain\" page within \"Project Settings\" has undergone a transformation! It's now a focused discovery page with a centralized hub for admins to effortlessly discover and install first-party (1P) and third-party (3P) integrations.\n\nThis change means the page will no longer serve its previous function of managing connected tools and opsgenie teams. We've also removed the Edit connections button from the \"Code\" page that previously linked to the \"Toolchain\" page.\n\nIf you need to manage security containers, head to the “Security” page in Jira. From there, you can utilize the connection manager sidebar.\n\nFinally, we've introduced a new Swap container button on the \"On-call\" page. This button replaces the Change connected Opsgenie team button.\n\nImproved search using summary and description fields\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re boosting performance in the issue navigator by changing how the search field works behind the scenes. When using the search field, results will be based on the Summary and Description fields.\n\nBefore this change, results were based on multiple text fields such as Summary, Description, Comments, and any custom text fields, which caused results to be slower to load.\n\nIf you’d prefer to search using text fields, select More + to view additional field filters, then select Text.\n\nTo try it out, head to the issue navigator by going to your project, then select Issues in the sidebar.\n\nNew ways to edit card covers\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNow you can easily choose a color or an attachment, or upload a new card cover.\n\nSelect the action menu on the bottom right and choose \"Edit cover\"\n\nBulk edit issues in Jira list\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nBulk edit up to 1000 issues at one time from your Jira list.\n\nTo bulk edit multiple issues:\n\nSelect multiple issues from your list using the issue checkboxes.\n\nOnce you’ve chosen the issues you’d like to edit, select Edit from the toolbar that appears.\n\nA sidebar will open which allows you to make edits for the shared fields across your selected issues.\n\nView even more issue information from your Jira list\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nView project, groups, cascading select, radio buttons, resolution, and status category information as field columns.\n\nTo view your new fields, scroll the list all the way to the right. You can then organize your fields how you like.\n\nShorter, saveable, downloadable, emailable reports for Assets\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've got a whole bunch of improvements in store for Reports for Assets in this release... Reports are now distinct dashboards, can be saved for ease of access later, can be downloaded, and can even be emailed to you!\n\nInline create for custom CMP boards\n\nYou can now create cards directly on boards with certain custom board filters.\n\nCopy and share a link to your Jira dashboard\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe're adding a \"Copy link\" button to let you share your Jira dashboards in other Atlassian products, such as on a Confluence page, whiteboard, or database. These links can be displayed as a card in Confluence to make it easier to share your Jira data with others.\n\nConfluence sprint retrospectives are now available on company-managed projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe are adding a prompt to company-managed projects to launch a sprint retrospective in Confluence as a whiteboard or page.\n\nPreviously these options were limited to team-managed projects.\n\nWhen you finish a sprint, you'll see an option to collaborate with your team in Confluence using our sprint retrospective templates. You can pick a whiteboard or a page.\n\nCreate multiple help centers on your site to serve different audiences\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nCreate multiple help centers on your Jira Service Management site and customize each of them for your various teams or audiences. Each help center can feature distinct branding, topics, portals, and announcements to effectively cater to specific user groups.\n\nYou need to be a Jira admin to create and manage multiple help centers.\n\nTo create a new help center:\n\nGo to Settings > Products > Jira Service Management > Configuration.\n\nIn the Help center section, select View all help centers.\n\nYou’ll be taken to the help center management page. Select Create help center.\n\nEnter a name and URL slug for your new help center and select Create.\n\nWe've also moved all the help center settings to a single place. Select your avatar from any help center on your site and you can find your requests, profile settings, and customization capabilities in the menu.\n\nGroup notifications in one email\n\nChoose when you want to get notified about issue activity and we’ll group your notifications into one email.\n\nWe’ll group notifications for the same issue into one email. You can then choose how often you want to receive notification emails for an issue.\n\nTo group notifications together:\n\nSelect Settings > Personal settings.\n\nSelect Projects and issues.\n\nTurn on the toggle to the right of Group notification emails together.\n\nUse the dropdown menu to choose how often you want to receive emails.\n\nInline create for boards with query swimlanes in company-managed projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now create cards directly on boards with certain swimlanes configured with JQL.\n\nThis announcement marks our fifth iteration of inline card creation for boards in company-managed projects.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAs part of our ongoing work to speed up the performance and improve the reliability of Assets in Jira Service Management, we're making a few minor UI changes.\n\nThis change involves that little counter at the bottom of the object list - it's getting updated to show a maximum count of 1000 objects, more than that and it'll show 1000+. And if you ever want to see how many more than 1000 that is, then simply select the 1000+ and it'll update to show the full object count. Simple huh? Happy Assets-ing!\n\nGet notified when your issues transition to another status\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIn team-managed projects, users can now receive a separate email when an issue transitions to a different status.\n\nPreviously, users in team-managed projects received the same email regardless of whether an issue was edited or transitioned to another status.\n\nProject admins can now enable a separate email to notify their team when an issue is transitioned. This provides more granular control about email notifications and reduces clutter for users who are only interested in issue transitions.\n\nTo enable email notifications to users when an issue is transitioned:\n\nFrom your project’s sidebar, select Project settings and then Notifications.\n\nSelect Add notification.\n\nUsing the dropdown, search for and select the issue event An issue is updated by a workflow transition (generic event).\n\nSelect the users and roles that will receive this notification.\n\nSelect Add.\n\nMore about customizing notifications in team-managed projects\n\nSmall change to the Automation audit log - we've updated the look and feel of the date picker to make it easier to use.\n\nTo check it out:\n\nNavigate to automation:\n\nFor Confluence automation, go to Confluence settings > Automation\n\nFor Jira automation, go to Jira settings > System > Global automation\n\nSelect Audit log.\n\nSelect Status and choose which statuses you want to filter by.\n\nUse Confluence templates in pages you create in Jira\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you create a Confluence page from a Jira issue, you now have a choice of templates to add to your page.\n\nFrom the Jira issue's drop-down menu, select Create and choose Page. We will start a draft and you'll have the option to choose a template from a list on the right side of the page.\n\nJira’s dot menu will be removed from August 19\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nWe’ve removing the dot menu in Jira to make way for a new and improved command palette.\n\nThe dot menu will be removed across Jira from August 19.

Cloud-to-cloud migration can help you combine data between two or more cloud sites, split a cloud site into multiple cloud sites, duplicate a cloud site, or move specific projects from one cloud site to another.\n\nOrg and site admins can access this feature by logging in to the cloud site you want to move your users and projects from, then going to Settings > System > Migrate cloud site.\n\nThe new global issue create experience is enabled for all instances\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve modernized and optimized the experience to create issues to make it fast and scalable. Note that you won’t be able to switch back to the old experience.\n\nUse the GitHub for Jira app to connect GitHub Enterprise, instead of DVCS\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nJira admins making a new GitHub connection for a new organisation now need to install the GitHub for Jira app. The app functions just like the DVCS Connector, but with better security features and improved performance.\n\nThis only applies to new GitHub connections in new organisations. Existing connections using DVCS are not affected.\n\nLearn more about the GitHub for Jira app.\n\nControl what you see in your products\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nProduct recommendations now have controls, so now you can dismiss them or learn more about why you’re seeing them. These controls are being added to the recommendations in the app switcher menu which means you'll have more control and receive better product recommendations.\n\nYou can select the three dots next to the recommendation to learn why we have recommended it or to dismiss it entirely.\n\nThe recommendation controls will first be released to both Free and Standard teams of up to 50 users. Note: Only admins will be able to add a new product by clicking on the recommendation.\n\nRetiring the possibility to manage the atlassian-addons-project-access role\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nFollowing up on our previous announcement, we’re planning to remove the possibility to manage the atlassian-addons-project-access role in two to six months. The exact date depends on the feedback we receive after this announcement.\n\nBy default, the role is assigned to all project permissions in permission schemes and all issue security levels in issue security schemes. As a result of this change, the possibility to manage that role’s permissions and issue security levels, both via the UI and the REST API, will be restricted.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the planned changes, please leave them under this public ticket.\n\nOrganize and track work against Compass software components\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now link issues to Compass components from any company-managed Jira Software project.\n\nThis helps your team organize and track work in Jira against elements of your software architecture cataloged in Compass – so you can understand the impact of that work; prioritize work more effectively; and find the information you need to get that work done faster.\n\nLearn more about Compass components\n\nSwitch to Compass components (project admins)\n\nIn your project sidebar, select Components.\n\nCheck that Compass components are turned on. Next to Create component, it should say Compass components. If it says Jira components, select it and switch to Compass components.\n\nJira components won't be deleted, and they'll still be visible on issues they were previously linked to. You can switch back to Jira components at any time.\n\nRead the full documentation\n\nLink issues to Compass components\n\nIf you don't have Compass yet:\n\nOn the Components page, select Get Compass free.

We’ll create a personalized Create issue form for each issue type and project.\n\nAll the fields you don’t use will be hidden in a More fields section, so you'll always be able to interact with them. The feature is continuously learning. If we notice you using a previously unused field, we’ll pull it out of the More fields section for the next time.\n\nWe’ll automatically turn on the feature to hide unused fields when creating issues, but you can manage it by heading to Personal settings and finding to the Jira labs section. From there, you can use the toggle to opt in and out of the feature.\n\nGet suggestions for child issues from AI\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nUse Atlassian Intelligence to generate a list of suggested child issues, based on the details of the parent issue.\n\nWhen you accept a suggestion, a new child issue will be created and linked to the parent issue.\n\nTo see a list of AI-generated suggestions:\n\nOpen the parent issue.\n\nSelect Add a child issue under the issue summary.

Here are recommendations for how to structure your data for Assets schemas.\n\nSee also: How to build an effective ITAM schema structure.\n\nFor this reason, we're introducing a maximum cardinality limit of 20,000 per object type attribute for Assets. Read more about recommended data structures for Assets.\n\nExceeding these limits can cause performance and reliability issues, therefore each site cannot create further items once they reach the limit. You can find out how many objects your site currently contains using the feature usage screen. Read more about how to track your usage.\n\nCustomize your navigation\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nProject admins can control what the team sees in the project view navigation.

You can now create, rename, move, set constraints for, and delete columns without leaving the board. You’ll still have the ability to do all of the above in your board’s settings page, but if you’ve only got time for a quick fix, we’ve now got you covered!\n\nIf you’re a project or board admin for the board you want to update, you can try the following changes:\n\nTo create a column, select the + icon to the right of all columns.\n\nTo rename a column, select its name to edit directly.\n\nTo move a column, select its top, then drag the column to its new position.\n\nTo set column constraints, right-click its name or hover to select more actions (•••) > Set column limit.\n\nTo delete a column, right-click its name or hover to select more actions (•••) > Delete.\n\nThe team field in Jira issues now shows the team icon\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nPreviously, selecting the team field in an issue would prompt a search displaying the singular \"Person\" icon. The correct \"Team\" icon now shows to indicate what should be selected for the field.\n\nDrag and drop to reparent issues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve made it easier to reparent issues in the timeline and list views.\n\nWe’re slowly rolling out this feature, so don’t worry if you can’t see this yet.\n\nIn the timeline and list views, you can now reparent a single issue by simply dragging and dropping it underneath a new parent issue.\n\nJira: Import from ClickUp\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nMoving your work from ClickUp to Jira just got easier.

Previously, this was only available for policies that covered entire workspaces or classification levels).\n\nThe data export rule requires Atlassian Guard Standard (formerly known as Atlassian Access).\n\nTo create a new data security policy or view existing policies:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security > Data security policies.\n\nEasily control the visibility of work suggestions in Jira\n\nWe're adding a \"Turn off work suggestions\" link to the Work suggestions panel footer to let you easily find the Work suggestions toggle under the View settings menu. When you turn the toggle off, you'll no longer get any suggestions, and the work suggestions panel won't open when you select your avatar on the Jira board.\n\nYou can always turn Work suggestions on at any time from the View settings menu to start getting suggestions again.\n\nRead more about Jira work suggestions\n\nProduct admin support for Jira imports\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAlong with organization admins, product admins can also use Jira’s new import experience to quickly and seamlessly import data into new business or software projects with just a few clicks.\n\nTo import data into Jira:\n\nSelect Projects from the navigation bar > Create project.\n\nFrom the sidebar, go to More > select Import data and follow the instructions.\n\nRead about the new import experience\n\nJira Service Management\n\nJira Service Desk is now Jira Service Management!

Note that you won’t be able to switch back to the old experience.\n\nUse the GitHub for Jira app to connect GitHub Enterprise, instead of DVCS\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nJira admins making a new GitHub connection for a new organisation now need to install the GitHub for Jira app. The app functions just like the DVCS Connector, but with better security features and improved performance.\n\nThis only applies to new GitHub connections in new organisations. Existing connections using DVCS are not affected.\n\nLearn more about the GitHub for Jira app.\n\nControl what you see in your products\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nProduct recommendations now have controls, so now you can dismiss them or learn more about why you’re seeing them. These controls are being added to the recommendations in the app switcher menu which means you'll have more control and receive better product recommendations.\n\nYou can select the three dots next to the recommendation to learn why we have recommended it or to dismiss it entirely.\n\nThe recommendation controls will first be released to both Free and Standard teams of up to 50 users. Note: Only admins will be able to add a new product by clicking on the recommendation.\n\nMake it easy and secure for customers to log in to your help center with single sign-on\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you connect an identity provider to your Jira Service Management site, you can authenticate your customers with SAML single sign-on (SSO).\n\nBefore you begin\n\nYou must subscribe to Atlassian Access from your organization before you set up SAML single sign-on.

The exact date depends on the feedback we receive after this announcement.\n\nBy default, the role is assigned to all project permissions in permission schemes and all issue security levels in issue security schemes. As a result of this change, the possibility to manage that role’s permissions and issue security levels, both via the UI and the REST API, will be restricted.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the planned changes, please leave them under this public ticket.\n\nUse filters to search and display Jira issues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNow you can use filters to search for Jira issues and display them in a list, without leaving the Confluence page.\n\nThis improvement follows the release that allows you to search for issues using keywords or JQL, and flexibility to add, remove, and reorder fields.\n\nHow to display Jira issues in a list\n\nStart using filters to search for Jira issues:\n\nEdit a Jira description or comment.\n\nType /jira and select Jira issues.\n\nWith Basic selected, use the filters to search by Project, Type, Status, or Assignee.\n\nSelect Insert issues.\n\nThis will display your selected issues in a list format you can interact with.\n\nTo edit your list of Jira issues:\n\nSelect anywhere on the list.\n\nSelect the Edit button (left-most icon) from the menu that appears at the bottom of the table.\n\nEdit your search query using Basic or JQL.\n\nSelect Insert issues.\n\nFilter results dashboard gadget improvements\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThe gadget now displays issues in the same way as they appear in the issue navigator. When you configure the gadget, changing the displayed columns and their ordering also works the same as in the issue navigator.\n\nTake a look at the improvements by adding a new Filter results gadget to one of your Jira dashboards.\n\nHide unused fields when creating issues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThere can be a lot of fields to scroll through when you’re creating issues, and we know there are many fields that are simply unused.\n\nWe’re introducing a feature that only brings up the fields you actually use. We’ll create a personalized Create issue form for each issue type and project.\n\nAll the fields you don’t use will be hidden in a More fields section, so you'll always be able to interact with them. The feature is continuously learning. If we notice you using a previously unused field, we’ll pull it out of the More fields section for the next time.\n\nWe’ll automatically turn on the feature to hide unused fields when creating issues, but you can manage it by heading to Personal settings and finding to the Jira labs section. From there, you can use the toggle to opt in and out of the feature.\n\nChat in Slack: Emoji shortcuts are now powered by Jira automation\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nEmoji shortcuts, based off Halp’s legacy recipes, now use Jira automation’s powerful no-code engine. With this change, admins can manage all automation rules in one place and emoji reactions can be used to edit issues created by Assist in Slack — all allowing for a simpler configuration experience.\n\nIf your projects have custom emoji rules, you have until June 4, 2024, to set up similar ones in automation. After that date, the emoji shortcut feature in chat settings will no longer function.\n\nFind out more in our Community blog\n\nBefore you start setting up your new automation rules, keep in mind:\n\nThe ticket emoji shortcut used to create issues isn’t affected by this change, so you don’t need to set this up in automation.\n\nYou need to set up the eyes emoji shortcut, which assigns agents to issues. Tip: Use the template from the Emoji shortcuts tab in chat settings to quickly set up this automation.\n\nTo set up emoji rules in automation:\n\nFrom your project settings, select Automation.\n\nSelect Create rule.\n\nSelect Emoji reaction to Slack message as your trigger*.*\n\nSelect Turn on rule, name your rule, and then Turn on rule again to save.\n\nTo help test your new emoji rules, you can now turn off emoji shortcuts in chat without deleting them:\n\nSet up your emoji rule in automation.\n\nFrom the Emoji shortcuts tab in chat settings, find the rule to turn off.\n\nUse the toggle to turn off the rule.\n\nTest to your satisfaction.\n\nUse Atlassian Intelligence to define words in the issue description\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now use Atlassian Intelligence to define one or more words in the issue description. The definitions will be based on information found in connected Confluence spaces.\n\nTo use Atlassian Intelligence to define words:\n\nMake sure the description is in view mode, not edit mode\n\nHighlight words you need defined\n\nSelect Define\n\nDefinitions are only available in the description in view mode.\n\nMaximum cardinality limit on multi-value attributes in Assets\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAssets in Jira Service Management is a database and so requires a combination of good data modeling and a great deal of processing power to handle large amounts of data. Here are recommendations for how to structure your data for Assets schemas.\n\nSee also: How to build an effective ITAM schema structure.\n\nFor this reason, we're introducing a maximum cardinality limit of 20,000 per object type attribute for Assets. Read more about recommended data structures for Assets.\n\nExceeding these limits can cause performance and reliability issues, therefore each site cannot create further items once they reach the limit. You can find out how many objects your site currently contains using the feature usage screen. Read more about how to track your usage.\n\nData limits for object schemas in Assets\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAssets in Jira Service Management is a database and so requires a combination of good data modeling and a great deal of processing power to handle large amounts of data. Here are recommendations for how to structure your data for Assets schemas.\n\nSee also: How to build an effective ITAM schema structure.\n\nFor this reason, we have introduced limitations on how many objects, attributes, and attribute characters can be stored inside schemas within each individual Assets in Jira Service Management site. Read more about how much data you can store in Assets.\n\nExceeding these limits can cause performance and reliability issues, therefore each site cannot create further items once they reach the limit.

Read more about how to track your usage.\n\nBeta: Group alerts using Atlassian Intelligence\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThis Atlassian Intelligence feature is in beta. Read more about Atlassian Intelligence features.\n\nAtlassian Intelligence groups related alerts and offers insightful suggestions, helping your team manage alerts and resolve issues more effectively. Alert grouping lessens 'alert fatigue' for your on-call agents. Rather than dealing with each alert separately, they can view a collective summary of similar alerts through an alert group. Over time, Atlassian Intelligence learns to recognize new alerts, identify patterns, and improve grouping based on user feedback.\n\nTo use the alert grouping feature, make sure that your organization admin has activated Atlassian Intelligence from Atlassian Administration. To access the feature, go to the Alerts page and switch to AI view. This works only if you’re using the new alerting feature that's natively available in Jira Service Management.\n\nRead more about alert grouping\n\nThe team field in Jira issues now shows the team icon\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nPreviously, selecting the team field in an issue would prompt a search displaying the singular \"Person\" icon. The correct \"Team\" icon now shows to indicate what should be selected for the field.\n\nJira: Import from ClickUp\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nMoving your work from ClickUp to Jira just got easier.

This is particularly useful when you receive requests by email and end up with a lot of issues with the Emailed request request type. By using the Atlassian Intelligence triage feature, you can easily update these issues to have more appropriate request types.\n\nTo update the request types of issues with Atlassian Intelligence:\n\nSelect issues in your queue.\n\nSelect Triage.\n\nReview the suggestions and select the issues you want to update.\n\nSelect Apply.\n\nInternal note visibility restrictions for Jira Service Management\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nSoon you’ll be able to restrict the visibility of internal notes based on your project roles and groups.\n\nSometimes, teams need to hold private discussions about customer requests, and in the case of particularly sensitive topics these discussions may need to be confidential between only a few team members (such as those in your HR or Legal teams).\n\nWith the ability to restrict the visibility of internal comments, you can now continue those confidential discussions on the issue itself, without having to transfer to email or use other tools to keep the information private.\n\nTo set the visibility for internal notes, navigate to an issue and open the issue view. Find the comment section, and start creating an internal note. Then, select the Comment visibility button. Select which group or project role you’d like to restrict this comment to. Now, save your comment.\n\nOnly the comment creator and users added to the selected group or project role will see this comment once it’s saved, meaning you can continue to work knowing your confidential request information will stay private to you and your team.\n\nFind out more about project roles in Jira Service Management, or learn how to create and manage your groups.\n\nCalendar view for new Jira Service Management projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re excited to launch a new view of issues in Jira Service Management: calendar view! Like the board or your queues, the calendar is another way to view and manage your work in the way that works best for you and your team.\n\nIt’s a great way for team members to plan, track, and prioritize, and for team leads to see potential roadblocks before they cause delays. Read more about using the calendar to view your issues.\n\nCreate a new project, then select Calendar in your project navigation to check it out. You can schedule issues in the calendar by adding and filling out the Start date and Due date fields on an issue. Once those fields are filled, the issues will appear on your calendar so that you can view your work across the coming month and beyond.\n\nAt the moment, the calendar is only available in new Jira Service Management projects, but it will become available for your existing projects soon, alongside new and improved calendar features to help you and your team do their best work.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've made some minor updates to the AI issue triage feature. Issues that can't be updated are now grouped together to allow for easier scanning and comprehension at a glance.\n\nAttach a form directly from the request type configuration page\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve made it even easier for admins to attach new forms to request types without needing to navigate to form settings.\n\nAfter selecting Attach form when in request type, you can now choose to either create a new form from the form template library, or search and select an existing form.\n\nSelect Create from template to browse over 200 form templates with pre-built conditional sections and rich formatting to help get you started sooner. Or Select existing to search all forms across your entire project.\n\nRead more about adding forms to request types\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen you move or bulk move issues to different projects or issue types (or migrate an issue type out of a project), you can now select the new request type during the move. We're excited to release this much-requested update to make issue migration simpler in Jira Service Management.\n\nRestrict request types in both company and team-managed service projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou may have request types in your service project that only specific people should be able to raise. Now you can control who can and can't raise these requests in Jira Service Management in both company and team-managed service projects!\n\nGive access to specific people and groups, and automatically restrict access to all others. If someone doesn’t have access to a request type, they won’t be able to raise that request as it won’t show up as an available option to them - even via search.\n\nRead more about restricting request types\n\nJira Product Discovery\n\nUse the GitHub for Jira app to connect GitHub Enterprise, instead of DVCS\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nJira admins making a new GitHub connection for a new organisation now need to install the GitHub for Jira app. The app functions just like the DVCS Connector, but with better security features and improved performance.\n\nThis only applies to new GitHub connections in new organisations. Existing connections using DVCS are not affected.\n\nLearn more about the GitHub for Jira app.\n\nNew granularity level for the timeline\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've increased the granularity displayed in the timeline to improve the overall experience.\n\nWhether you have chosen quarters or months for your timeline, you can now resize cards between months and half months.\n\nNew summary layout in your timeline\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIn your timeline, you can now change the card layout to a summarized one. In this layout, you can only display one field.\n\nIn the timeline view, select the layout changer icon and click Summary.\n\nHover over the card to see all the details.\n\nTo select the field that will be shown in the summary layout, go to Fields, hover over a field, and select the star icon.\n\nRemember you can display only one field in the summary card mode.\n\nWe've introduced time markers for your timeline.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now mark a specific date in your timeline.\n\nIn your discovery project, go to a timeline and click anywhere in the time header.

Once configured, Confluence admins designate a custom domain email as their organization's site sender, so their users will receive Confluence notifications from that customized email address. More on configuring customize domain emails\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThe commenting experience will now be available in whiteboards, alongside pages. Leave comments, @mention teammates, reply to conversations, and more with comments in Confluence whiteboards. You can see mentions and replies directly in your notifications.\n\nSwitch to comment mode in a whiteboard by selecting the comment icon in the toolbar on the right or use M on your keyboard. Once you're in comment mode, click anywhere on the whiteboard to create a comment.\n\nIntroducing Spaces report: Empower your space management\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nUnlock comprehensive space management with our new Spaces report feature. Export detailed CSV reports on space activity, creation, and more directly from Confluence. This feature is ideal for admins seeking insights into space usage, activity, and storage.\n\nKey changes:\n\nExportable CSV reports for product admins, detailing each space's key metrics.\n\nReports include space key, name, type, status, creation date, last activity, and storage used.\n\nNew Spaces report page under Data management for easy access and report management.\n\nSupports organization, site, and product admins across Standard, Premium, and Enterprise plans.\n\nThis feature also provides essential space management data previously unavailable in Confluence. It aids in identifying inactive spaces, managing storage, and enhancing external collaboration, significantly improving admin efficiency and decision-making.\n\nRecommendation emails\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhat's new or different?\n\nIntroducing recommendation emails—a weekly list of recommended and popular content, relevant to the spaces that each Confluence user has access to.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nData security policies allow you to use rules to control how users, apps, and people outside the organization can interact with content such as Confluence pages and Jira issues.\n\nYou can now use the public links rule to prevent people creating and accessing public links in particularly sensitive Confluence spaces. Previously, this was only available for policies that covered classification levels or entire Confluence instances. How the public links rule works\n\nThe public links rule requires Atlassian Guard Standard (formerly known as Atlassian Access).\n\nTo create a new data security policy or view existing policies:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security > Data security policies.\n\nPrevent people from exporting content in specific spaces and projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nData security policies allow you to use rules to control how users, apps, and people outside the organization can interact with content such as Confluence pages and Jira issues.\n\nYou can now use the data export rule to prevent people exporting content from particularly sensitive Confluence spaces and Jira projects.

Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security > Data security policies.\n\nIntroducing text highlighting\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the addition of text highlighting to our editor, a highly requested feature that enhances your content creation and collaboration experience. This new functionality allows you to easily highlight text, making important information stand out.\n\nThe ability to highlight text is easily accessed from the main editing toolbar, located right beside the text color option. Six highlight colors are available: grey, teal, lime, orange, magenta, and purple.\n\nHighlighting can only be done by individuals with editing privileges for a page, unlike comments.\n\nPremium and Enterprise: Customize a dynamic info hub for your entire company with Company Hub\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nCompany Hub allows you to customize a beautiful and dynamic company-wide information central within Confluence, where employees can go for up-to-date announcements, news, key resources, and more.\n\nProduct admins can add a custom name and color scheme along with images, visual cards, links, and more to instantly craft a hub that looks and feels like your company's go-to destination.\n\nThis feature is currently in beta and rolling out gradually to our Premium and Enterprise customers.\n\nEmbed your Jira dashboards in Confluence\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou will now be able to copy a link from a Jira dashboard and paste it into Confluence as a smart link embed. This makes it easier to share your Jira data with other Confluence users.\n\nProfile cards show in edit mode\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nSelecting an @mention while editing will now show the person's profile card.\n\nSearch directly from the content tree\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNow you can filter items in the content tree by title, making it faster and easier to find what you're looking for.\n\nJust select the magnifying glass below the Content header and start entering a keyword from the item's title.\n\nEffortless content arrangement with drag-and-drop\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThis update introduces new drag-and-drop functionality for top-level elements in the Confluence editor, making it easier than ever to arrange your content. This feature enhances the user experience by allowing smooth content movement, reducing the need for cut-and-paste actions, and providing a more intuitive and modern editing experience.\n\nWhat's new:\n\nDrag and drop for top-level elements: A new drag handle makes it easy to rearrange any top-level element on your page.\n\nInstant selection: Select any element with a single action on the drag handle for fast and convenient movement.\n\nAuto-scroll functionality: Move content above or below the fold with automatic scrolling, ensuring smooth navigation while rearranging elements.\n\nFixed column widths for tables\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re pleased to introduce a new feature that enhances your control over your tables. You can now set column widths to fixed, ensuring that your table layout remains consistent even on narrow screens. This option is available in Table options in the table toolbar and is unchecked by default, allowing tables to scale as they always have. For those who prefer their tables to respond dynamically to screen sizes, we’ve increased the maximum scaling to give your tables even more flexibility.\n\nHow to use:\n\nInsert or select a table on your page.\n\nSelect the Table options icon in the table toolbar.\n\nSelect the Fixed column widths option to prevent your table columns from scaling down on narrow screens.\n\nThis update allows you to maintain the integrity of your table layouts across different screen sizes, providing a more consistent viewing experience.\n\nAutomation: Project created trigger\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nOne for the Confluence automation fans! You can now trigger Confluence automation rules when a Jira project is created.\n\nFor example, you could create a rule where every time a Jira project is created, Confluence creates a corresponding space and pages.\n\nTo give this a try:\n\nNavigate to Confluence automation\n\nFor space automation, go to Space settings > Automation\n\nFor global automation, go to Confluence administration > Automation\n\nWhen creating or modifying a rule, select Project created in Jira as the trigger.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now transfer ownership of your whiteboard, database, or Smart Link in the content tree to another user. Space and product admins can also make this change when needed.\n\nThis functionality was previously only available for pages, and ensures that the right person is always associated with the content.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now comment directly on inline elements such as emojis, statuses, mentions, dates, and inline cards (Smart links). Users can now leave comments on these specific elements, streamlining the commenting process and making it more intuitive and efficient for providing feedback and collaborating on documents.\n\nSmall change to the Automation audit log - we've updated the look and feel of the date picker to make it easier to use.\n\nTo check it out:\n\nNavigate to automation:\n\nFor Confluence automation, go to Confluence settings > Automation\n\nFor Jira automation, go to Jira settings > System > Global automation\n\nSelect Audit log.\n\nSelect Status and choose which statuses you want to filter by.\n\nBitbucket\n\nCache key support for self-hosted runners\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nSince releasing cache key support for builds on the Atlassian infrastructure earlier this year, we have been actively working to add cache key support for our customers who are using runners. That being said, we are happy to announce that we now support runners using cache key to generate caches. Additional documentation on smart caches with cache keys can be found in the following section of our Caches help documentation: Caching with file-based cache keys.\n\nCompass\n\nUpgrade your Compass GitHub app to allow Compass to ingest pull request data\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAccept the updated permissions for your Compass GitHub app to authorize Compass to enrich the PR data/insights we show you in Compass.\n\nUpgrade your Compass GitHub app:\n\nIn GitHub, go to the organization settings for the organization that you've connected the Compass app to.\n\nSelect GitHub apps on the left sidebar.\n\nSelect the Review request link.\n\nEnter your GitHub password.\n\nSelect Accept new permissions.\n\nYou're now on the latest version of the Compass GitHub app.\n\nAtlassian Analytics\n\nVisual SQL: Write custom formulas using Atlassian Intelligence (AI)\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou no longer need to worry about memorizing SQLite syntax for custom formulas. You can use natural language to tell AI how you want to transform your data, and AI will generate the SQLite expression for you.\n\nTo try it out:\n\nAdd a Formula column or Apply formula step.\n\nSelect Custom from the formula options.\n\nSelect AI.\n\nUse natural language to describe how you want to transform your data.\n\nSelect Submit.\n\nPowered by Confluence and Scroll Viewport.",
      "# [Atlassian developer changelog](https://developer.atlassian.com/changelog/)\nRollout: progressive rollout by tenant IN PROGRESS\n\nFollowing our earlier deprecation notice, the changelog item for the parent field (IssueParentAssociation) in Team managed projects will change to have attributes fromString and toString return issue keys instead of issue ids.\n\nThe issue id remains available in the from and to attributes.\n\nWe will not be issuing any new waivers for apps that need to request or store Atlassian user API tokens. This decision is part of our ongoing commitment to enhancing security and protecting customer trust.\n\nForge Apps that have already been granted waivers must ensure a lack of alternative solutions within Forge. They can continue to operate, but no additional waivers will be granted for new modules or new functionality within the same app.\n\nConnect apps that have been granted waivers and any existing Connect app requesting or storing Atlassian user API tokens are required to migrate to Forge, with tokens stored in Forge encrypted storage.\n\nWith the recent updates to our content delivery network (CDN), all Custom UI apps now include the Atlassian emojis API URL in the allow-list by default. This means you no longer need to declare egress to fetch emojis in Custom UI apps.\n\nThese recent updates help you reduce unnecessary egress declarations from your Custom UI apps.\n\nThese updates can help if you’re looking to make your app eligible for the Runs on Atlassian badge. To learn more about Runs on Atlassian, see this developer blog post.\n\nNote, the removal of egress does not require a major version update of apps.\n\nThe fiveMinute scheduled trigger interval is now generally available (GA).\n\nDevelopers can now use the scheduled trigger module to create scheduled trigger modules in a Forge app with intervals of fiveMinute, hour, day, and week.\n\nFor more information on using these intervals, see the https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/manifest-reference/modules/scheduled-trigger/#scheduled-trigger module documentation.\n\nWe’ve added a new optional parameter openOnInsert to the configuration object in the manifest of Forge macros. This allows developers to control if the custom configuration modal is automatically opened when first inserted.\n\nFor more information, see Macro.\n\nWith the introduction of draft pull requests in Bitbucket Cloud, REST API endpoints for pull requests now include a boolean attribute draft that can be used in both read and write operations. Webhook event paylods for pull requests also now include the draft parameter.\n\nNote that the draft attribute is a separate field from the pull request state. Draft pull requests will always have state: \"OPEN\" and draft: true.\n\nFor further info, please see our developer documentation.\n\nREST API docs\n\nWebhook event docs\n\nReminder: Starting , a subset of Connect extension points will no longer be available on Confluence pages.

      "# [Atlassian Cloud changes Jan 13 to Jan 20, 2025](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/blog/2025/01/atlassian-cloud-changes-jan-13-to-jan-20-2025)\nThese changes have recently been rolled out to Atlassian Cloud sites.\n\nChanges labeled ROLLING OUT are being gradually rolled out and may not be on your site just yet.\n\nAtlassian Administration\n\nAtlassian Administration is where you manage your Atlassian organization, including user access to products, security settings, and billing preferences.\n\nDefer the rollout of specific changes\n\nROLLING OUT NEW THIS WEEK\n\nThere may be times when your organization needs more time to prepare for a change Atlassian is rolling out to your products.\n\nDefer a specific change for at least 30 days, and prepare your teams for the rollout.\n\nFirst, you’ll need to allow all org admins to defer individual changes. Then, all org admins can defer a specific change.\n\nThis is currently in beta. Visit our post on Community to learn more and give feedback, or learn how to defer changes.\n\nTo allow admins to defer changes:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Products> Product updates.\n\nFrom the section message at the top of the page, select Allow admins to defer changes.\n\nTo defer a change:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Products> Product updates.\n\nSelect the Defer rollout filter.\n\nSelect Can defer.\n\nSelect the release note for the change you want to defer.\n\nSelect Defer rollout.\n\nCopy specific Jira Service Management and Jira Work Management projects to your sandbox\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nCopy only the projects you need to save time setting up your Jira Service Management and Jira Work Management sandbox. Understand how to select data to copy\n\nTo copy specific Jira Service Management and Jira Work Management projects from your production to its sandbox:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Products > Sandbox.\n\nSelect Copy production data for the Jira Service Management or Jira Work Management product.\n\nSelect Specific projects.\n\nSelect the service or work management projects you need.\n\nFollow the prompts to copy data to your sandbox.\n\nMore about what we copy to sandboxes\n\nData security policies have a fresh new look\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nData security policies allow organization admins to control how users, apps, and people outside the organization can interact with content.\n\nCurrently, when you create a new policy, we list all the available rules for the selected coverage area. This was confusing and led to people accidentally activating the policy without configuring the rules.\n\nNow, when you create a new policy you’ll explicitly add each rule to the policy as you configure it. This makes it much easier to see which rules the policy enforces.\n\nThese are minor changes that don’t change the functionality of your existing policies, but we hope will make it easier to set up and inspect in future.\n\nTo create a new data security policy or view existing policies:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security > Data security policies.\n\nWe’re replacing Beacon with Guard Detect\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThis update only applies to organizations that participated in the Beacon or Atlassian Information Security beta.\n\nBeacon (beta) will soon be part of Atlassian Guard Premium. Read the blog\n\nWe’re replacing ‘Beacon’ with ‘Guard Detect’ in the CSV files you export. The name of your groups (such as beacon-admins) will not change.\n\nIn Atlassian Administration, you’re able to export CSV files for:\n\nManaged accounts\n\nAudit logs\n\nExternal users\n\nUser API tokens\n\nAuthentication policies\n\nWe recommend checking and updating any scripts that may be impacted by the change.\n\nAccessibility and style improvements to tables and page layouts\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe restyled tables and updated the layout of pages. This improves accessibility and readability in Atlassian Administration.\n\nYou can see the changes on most pages in admin.atlassian.com.\n\nGet the products your team has requested, faster\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now review and approve new product requests from your users and add them to your organization, all from one place in admin.atlassian.com.\n\nThis is available for Confluence, Jira, Jira Service Management. Coming soon to Bitbucket.\n\nYou’ll still have the option to deny product requests or mark them as under review.\n\nHow to review product requests\n\nTo approve product requests:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security then Product requests.\n\nFind the product request, and select Review request.\n\nFrom the product request, select Approve.\n\nRead the information and select Next to continue.\n\nChoose a name for the new site.\n\nSelect Accept and add product to finish. We’ll email the requestor to let them know you approved their request.\n\nIt can take a few minutes to create your new site and product. If you don’t see the new product immediately, check Products after a few minutes.\n\nOnce you can see the new site and product, invite the requestor and any other team members that need access.\n\nApply a default classification level for all Confluence products in your organization\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nData classification is the process of categorizing the sensitivity of information.\n\nApply a default classification level that can be enforced across all your Confluence products in your organization. This classification level will be applied to all unclassified content within Confluence.\n\nThis process requires Atlassian Guard Premium.\n\nTo apply a default classification level for all Confluence products in your organization:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security > Data classification\n\nSelect More actions (•••) > Manage settings\n\nChoose the classification level\n\nSelect Update\n\nSee what’s happening across your organization with your new overview\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nGet an enhanced idea of what’s going on across your organization with our new overview page at admin.atlassian.com. Quickly find your most important tasks, monitor what’s happening with insights, and explore new features.\n\nTurn on Direct Access for products on a domain with a one-time prompt\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen a user requests access to a new product, admins who don't have Direct Access enabled on their domain will need to review and approve each request manually.\n\nTo make managing access requests easy and efficient, admins can now turn on Direct Access for products on their domain via a one-time prompt. They can dismiss this prompt and turn on Direct Access anytime in Admin Hub in User Access Settings.\n\nPrevent your team from using new Bitbucket workspaces without your approval\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nYou can now proactively manage product requests for Bitbucket from admin.atlassian.com. This feature provides you with more oversight to control Shadow IT and billing.\n\nAfter you select admin review required, you can approve or deny new Bitbucket requests from your managed accounts. This gives you greater control over where your team does their work.\n\nThis is available for Bitbucket as part of a beta program. It’s also available for Jira, Jira Service Management, Confluence, and Trello with an Enterprise subscription.\n\nMore about product requests\n\nTo manage product requests for Bitbucket:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security > Product requests.\n\nSelect Request settings. If this is your first time updating these settings, you may need to select Update request settings.\n\nNext to Bitbucket, select Require admin review under the Request setting dropdown.\n\nThe next time one of your managed accounts tries to sign up for a product, they’ll receive a prompt to enter a reason for their request. After they create the request, all organization admins receive an email, letting them know someone created a request.\n\nRovo customer admins can now add bookmarks\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdmins (organization, site or product) on sites with Rovo can now add bookmarks to highlight particular URLs in Rovo Search, based on specific search terms. You can bookmark any URL - it doesn’t need to be in your Atlassian products or previously found in search.\n\nThere are two different methods to add bookmarks depending on whether you are a organization admin, or a site/product admin.\n\nHow to add or edit Rovo Search bookmarks\n\nCopy product data early access program: Solving duplication of Jira entities\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe're working on a solution to allow you to make decisions on how conflicting entities should be handled before copying data. We expect this to help in reducing the effort taken for post-migration clean-up. Before we make this feature generally available, we’re looking for individuals who would like to partner with us in an early access program to ensure our solution meets your needs.\n\nRead the[ community blog|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Cloud-Admins-articles/Early-Access-Program-for-solving-duplication-of-Jira-entities/ba-p/2862936] which has steps for how to sign up for the early access program.\n\nApply security settings to different mobile apps\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou now have the flexibility to set up different security policies to meet the security needs of specific Atlassian mobile apps. A mobile app policy allows you to apply security settings to all or one mobile app at a time.\n\nYour default mobile policy applies security settings to Confluence, Jira and Opsgenie. To apply different levels of security to one of these mobile apps, you can create a mobile app policy or edit your default mobile app policy.\n\nTo create a mobile app policy:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security > Mobile app policies.\n\nSelect Create mobile app policy or Add mobile app policy and follow the prompts*.*\n\nTo edit a mobile app policy:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security > Mobile app policies.\n\nTo edit a mobile app policy, select Actions (…) and follow the prompts*.*\n\nPrevent people who are not logged in from viewing Confluence pages\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nData security policies allow you to control how users, apps, and people outside the organization interact with content, such as Confluence pages and Jira issues.\n\nYou can now use the anonymous access rule to prevent people who aren’t logged in from viewing Confluence pages.\n\nPreviously, the rule only blocked anonymous access to Jira issues. Now, in policies that cover Products, it will block Confluence pages as well.\n\nThe anonymous access rule requires Atlassian Guard Standard.\n\nTo create a new data security policy or view existing policies:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security > Data security policies.\n\nPrevent people who are not logged in from viewing Confluence pages\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nData security policies allow you to control how users, apps, and people outside the organization interact with content, such as Confluence pages and Jira issues.\n\nYou can now use the anonymous access rule to prevent people who aren’t logged in from viewing Confluence pages.\n\nPreviously, the rule blocked anonymous access to Jira issues and in policies that cover Products in Confluence. Now, it will also block access to Confluence pages within policies that cover spaces and projects.\n\nThe anonymous access rule requires Atlassian Guard Standard.\n\nTo create a new data security policy or view existing policies:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security > Data security policies.\n\nAtlassian goals and projects are part of the platform\n\nGoals, projects, topics, and other features that used to be part of Atlas are now part of the Atlassian platform. This means they’re free for all customers.\n\nOver the next few months, we’ll be rolling out these features to all customers. These features help teams connect the dots across their work, wherever it happens, all from a new Atlassian Home. Read about these features and Atlassian Home\n\nIf your organization has early access to platform experiences, this release comes with the ability to control who can access Goals and Projects.\n\nWe’ll notify you before we roll out to your organization, so you can decide who can view and create goals and projects on day one.\n\nIf you were an Atlas customer, we’re going to remove your Atlas workspaces. We’ll notify you before this happens. Your existing data won’t be affected. Users will be able to access any data they can access in Atlas today.\n\nScroll and filter Atlassian product changes with ease\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThe new table layout in Product updates allows you to view more release notes on one page.\n\nFilter by Status, Change type, or Product to get an overview of the changes most important to you, in the order they’re rolling out, so you can plan more efficiently.\n\nHow to keep up with Atlassian changes\n\nTo find and view release notes:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Products > Product updates.\n\nTrack activities for Atlassian Analytics in the audit log\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nUse the audit log to see key activities such as when a dashboard, chart, data source, or data share is created, edited, or deleted.

Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security > Audit log.\n\nFrom the Product filter, select Atlassian Analytics.\n\nThe audit log will show all tracked activities for Atlassian Analytics in your organization.\n\nAPI token controls no longer require Atlassian Guard Standard\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou no longer need a subscription to Atlassian Guard Standard to use API token controls.\n\nWhen you set up an authentication policy, you can allow or block members from:\n\n-Creating a new API token to authenticate\n\n-Using an existing API token to authenticate\n\nYou can do this without a subscription to Atlassian Guard Standard\n\nTo try out the API token setting:\n\nLog in to admin.atlassian.com\n\nSelect Security > Authentication policies.\n\nSelect Edit for the policy you want to change.\n\nSelect block API token setting.\n\nSCIM API keys expire in one year\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nWe're changing the expiration date for SCIM API keys from an infinite lifespan to a one year expiration date: This change applies only when you:\n\n-set up user provisioning for the first time\n\n-regenerate an existing SCIM API key\n\nThis change does not affect existing SCIM API keys for now.\n\nWe’re making this change to reduce security risk for any leaked or stolen keys and to encourage you to rotate your keys. If a key is leaked or stolen, its limited lifespan prevents attackers from using it indefinitely to access sensitive information.\n\nWhen is this changing?\n\n-On December 15, 2024, SCIM API keys expire in one year. This includes a SCIM API key that we create when you set up user provisioning or when you regenerate a SCIM API key.\n\nHow to view the SCIM API key’s expiration date when you set up user provisioning:\n\nLog in to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security > Identity providers.\n\nSelect your Identity provider Directory.\n\nSelect Set up user provisioning and follow the prompts.\n\nView API key expires date in User provisioning.\n\nHow to view the SCIM API key’s expiration date when you regenerate an API key:\n\nLog in to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security > Identity providers.\n\nSelect your Identity provider Directory.\n\nSelect Regenerate API key from […} and follow the prompts.\n\nView API key expires date in User provisioning.\n\nKnowing when you're approaching the Free user limit just got easier\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe're making it easier for you to know when you're approaching the Free user limit when you're looking at Admin settings by including a banner under Directory > Users.\n\nTrack Rovo usage with insights on Agent interactions\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nYou can now view the number of requests users have sent to Rovo Chat or Agents. Usage metrics also include the percentage of unused quota left for the month. For a limited time, usage beyond quotas will not incur additional charges.\n\nHow Rovo usage quota works\n\nTo view quota usage for Rovo requests:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security then Insights.\n\nNavigate to the chart named Requests sent to Rovo.\n\nDeleting extra mobile app policies that we don’t enforce\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe currently allow you to create one mobile app policy per organization.\n\nSome of you may have created multiple mobile app policies with the Admin REST API. Even if you created more than one, we only enforce the most recent policy.\n\nEffective 04 December 2024, we will delete any extra mobile app policies that we don’t enforce. You will see the policy we deleted in audit logs.\n\nYou can use the Admin REST API to view deleted policies for up to 30 days.\n\nWe are making this change in order to enable the introduction of a new update: you will soon be able to create one mobile app policy per app.\n\nUnderstand mobile app policies\n\nBlock the download of files attached to pages with extended data export rule\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nData security policies allow you to use rules to control how users, apps, and people outside the organization interact with content in Confluence and Jira.\n\nWe’re extending the data export rule to also block the downloading of files attached to Confluence pages. After this rule takes effect, users will no longer find a download button in sections like the attachment list, macros, and file previews.\n\nWe opted to extend the data export rule rather than introduce a new one because of the considerable overlap between export and download. Our findings showed that the types organizations needing to block exports also wanted to prevent attachment downloads.\n\nThis change will affect any existing policies that have configured the data export rule to block exports. At this stage, it will not block attachment downloads in Jira.\n\nTo check whether your data security policies currently block exports:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com. Select your organization if you have more than one.\n\nSelect Security > Data security policies.\n\nSelect a policy, and check whether exporting data is blocked.\n\nThe data export rule requires Atlassian Guard Standard.\n\nDetect potentially sensitive data in Jira in real time\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nManaging sensitive data is a huge priority for many organizations.\n\nIf you have Atlassian Guard Premium, you can now detect when sensitive data is added to a Jira issue, including financial details, credentials, and other terms that may be sensitive to your organization.\n\nWe detect sensitive data in the issue summary, description, any other field that contains free text. We don’t currently detect sensitive data in comments, or in fields that are not free text, such as dropdown menus.\n\nAs an issue may have many subsequent updates, we update the existing alert if more sensitive data is added, and only send a new alert if more sensitive data is detected after 24 hours.\n\nFor every content scanning detection you have the option to send alerts for Confluence, for Jira products, or both. For example, if storing International Bank Account Numbers (IBAN) in Jira is part of your process, you can turn the IBAN content scanning detection off for Jira, and keep it on for Confluence.\n\nBecause you may have legitimate reasons to store certain sensitive data in Jira, we’re rolling out this change with all content scanning detections turned off for Jira.\n\nTo start getting sensitive data alerts go to Detections > Content scanning then expand each of the detections you want to turn on.\n\nWhat sensitive data is detected?\n\nMultiple sandboxes for a single production site\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now create multiple sandboxes for a single production site. Thanks to that, your teams can get a sandbox environment of their own so they can test different kinds of changes in parallel, for example:\n\nApp testing sandbox\n\nNew features sandbox\n\nMigration sandbox\n\nMultiple sandboxes are in open Beta, available for Enterprise plans. For every plan, like Jira Enterprise or Confluence Enterprise, you can create 10 sandboxes across your entire organization. You can use them for a single production site or spread across more sites, depending on where you need to test the changes.\n\nTell me more about multiple sandboxes\n\nTo get started:\n\nGo to admin.atlassian.com, and select your organization.\n\nGo to Products > Sandbox.\n\nJira platform\n\nChanges in this section usually apply to all Jira products. We'll tell you in the change description if something is only for a specific Jira product.\n\nIt’s easier for people with Jira to start using Jira Product Discovery\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe know our products can be complicated. So now people who have Jira, and have recently also added Jira Product Discovery, will see simple recommendations on how to start using Jira Product Discovery. For example, inviting teammates, using a template, etc.\n\nThat means it’s easier to know what to do first in Jira Product Discovery so that you’re getting the most out of it.\n\nThe recommendations will show up in the ‘Your work’ part of Jira, and everyone with either a Free, Standard, or Premium plan will see them. You can dismiss them anytime so they stop showing up.\n\nStreamlining general and blank project templates in Jira Service Management\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re simplifying our Jira Service Management project templates and no longer splitting out our general and blank templates by IT and business team types. Now you’ll see just one general service management template and one blank template to cater to all needs - no matter the team type.\n\nThese project templates will replace the previous general service management for IT teams and general service management for business teams templates, and the blank project for IT teams and blank project for business teams.\n\nUse the general service management template if you wish to get up and running with basic pre-configured settings to start managing incoming service requests, whilst blank projects let you fully customize how you manage incoming service requests.\n\nFind out more about projects templates in Jira Service Management\n\nNew ways to edit card covers\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNow you can easily choose a color or an attachment, or upload a new card cover.\n\nSelect the action menu on the bottom right and choose \"Edit cover\"\n\nHighlight work with color in your list\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIdentify and highlight key work that needs your attention with format rules in your list. With a format rule, you can automatically format individual cells or entire rows with colors, when specific criteria is met.\n\nFor example, to highlight work that’s running behind schedule, you could create the rule: red row when due date is before today. More examples of format rules and their purpose, plus how to create a format rule.\n\nTo create a new format rule in your list:\n\nGo to your project, and select List.\n\nSelect Format.\n\nSelect + Add a rule in the Format rules sidepanel.\n\nWe're adding an upgrade button for Free customers\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIn the top right of the navigation, you might see a new button that will help you upgrade to a new plan when you get close to the user limit.\n\nThis button will help you understand how many users you have, what you get when you upgrade, and how to upgrade.\n\nGet notified when your issues transition to another status\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIn team-managed projects, users can now receive a separate email when an issue transitions to a different status.\n\nPreviously, users in team-managed projects received the same email regardless of whether an issue was edited or transitioned to another status.\n\nProject admins can now enable a separate email to notify their team when an issue is transitioned. This provides more granular control about email notifications and reduces clutter for users who are only interested in issue transitions.\n\nTo enable email notifications to users when an issue is transitioned:\n\nFrom your project’s sidebar, select Project settings and then Notifications.\n\nSelect Add notification.\n\nUsing the dropdown, search for and select the issue event An issue is updated by a workflow transition (generic event).\n\nSelect the users and roles that will receive this notification.\n\nSelect Add.\n\nMore about customizing notifications in team-managed projects\n\nDiscover Confluence templates within your Jira issue\n\nIf you’re using Jira and have recently added or been given access to Confluence, you'll now see templates in certain issues. The templates will be for relevant types of documents to your issues. For example:\n\nBug issue type = Known errors Confluence template\n\nStory issue type = Product requirement Confluence template\n\nEpic issue type = Project plan issue type\n\nIf you select one of these templates, you'll be able to create the page without leaving Jira. It will then automatically be linked to your issue. After that, you won’t see the templates in any Jira issue.\n\nThese templates will appear for up to 14 days after Confluence is first added to your site, after which they'll disappear.\n\nYou can remove the templates from your Jira issues at any point using the more actions menu on the placeholder itself.\n\nQuickly view images directly from your board issue cards\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nBy adding an image attachment to an issue, you can show or hide images directly from your board in a company-managed software project.\n\nTo add or change an issue’s cover image:\n\nNavigate to your board view.\n\nHover over an issue.\n\nSelect ••• (more) on the issue.\n\nSelect Edit cover image and choose from the options.\n\nNew Jira instances are now domain-enabled\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nNew Jira instances will be automatically domain-enabled from now on, meaning anyone with your organization's email domain (the one you used to sign up) will have access to projects that you send them links to. It'll save you time – you won't need to grant them access, after you've invited them. (Excludes existing Jira instances.) Find out how to disable this feature in your new Jira instance.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe're introducing a new feature to Jira and Confluence automation that allows you to check your rule for errors before enabling them. This validation feature will help to improve efficiency and accuracy during rule creation, as you'll no longer need to search for errors yourself before turning on your rule. Please note that some errors may not be identified during the validation process, so keep an eye on the audit log to ensure no more errors occur after the rule runs.\n\nTo get started with this change:\n\n1. Navigate to the automation rule builder in Jira or Confluence automation.\n\n2. Create your desired rule.\n\n3. Once you have finished editing your rule, click on the dropdown arrow next to the Turn on rule button.\n\n4. Select Validate rule.\n\n5. We'll advise you if any errors or warnings were found in your rule. Follow the steps provided in the rule builder to fix these.\n\n6. Select Validate rule again to ensure your rule no longer contains any identifiable errors.\n\n7. Once your rule is ready, turn it on.\n\nCreate a board more easily for your company-managed software project\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nFor those who are on our Early Access Program, we've streamlined the board creation experience. You'll still be able to create a board for your company-managed software projects directly from the sidebar navigation. Boards can also be starred, allowing you to easily navigate to the areas where you most often work.\n\nNote: This is only for company-managed software projects and for customers who have been selected to participate in the Early Access Program.\n\nCreate and edit issue types from the project summary\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdmins in team-managed business projects can now create and edit issue types directly from the summary page, without navigating to project settings.\n\nSimply select Create issue type, or hover over the name to see the Edit icon, make your updates, and confirm.\n\nChanges to the copy for Confluence listing in App Switcher\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThe app switcher in your Atlassian products is used to switch between different apps and products.\n\nIf you have Confluence, you will see it listed in the app switcher with a short sentence about what it is and what you can use it for. This sentence disappears after your first 15 days of having Confluence.\n\nThis sentence has been updated. It will now read: Confluence. Document collaboration.\n\nRemoval of SEN from UPM Manage apps\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThe SEN field has now been removed from the Manage apps section of UPM. To identify an entitlement, you'll have to use the new cloud identifier, which is the Entitlement number.\n\nIt's easier for end users to connect the right type of Confluence docs to Jira issues\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nJira issues have a field for Confluence content so that you can link important documents to your tasks in Jira. Now, if you’re viewing a bug, story, or epic issue, you may see a recommended Confluence template.\n\nThese templates are customized based on the issue type. For example, a ‘known errors' template will appear in a bug issue.\n\nBefore, end users could only use these templates by sending a request for Confluence to their admin. Now, end users on Free plans can access Confluence and the templates straight away, without leaving Jira and without waiting for request approval.\n\nYou can dismiss these template recommendations at any time.\n\nReducing ‘issue’ terminology in Jira\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re reducing the use of 'issue' terminology in an effort to simplify our language and better suit all team types.\n\nMore text formatting for Jira paragraph custom fields\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWith more edit options available in newly created paragraph custom fields, you can style long-form text and links how you like. Now available for company-managed projects.\n\nTo view this change to paragraph custom fields:\n\nCreate a new paragraph custom field in your Jira project.\n\nAdd the newly created paragraph field to any issue type in project settings.\n\nOpen any issue within the same issue type.\n\nSelect the newly created paragraph custom field from the issue, to view and use the new edit experience.\n\nSimplify your marketing work intake with a form template\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWith a ready-to-go template, you can quickly request information from your stakeholders for marketing campaigns, content creation, event planning, social media posts, graphic design, or email marketing.\n\nTo get started:\n\nSelect Forms from the project view navigation.\n\nSelect Templates to open the templates drawer on the right.\n\nLearn more about creating forms\n\nAdmins can now delete previous project keys\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re giving admins the ability to delete previous project keys so they can be used for new projects.\n\nWhenever you change your project key, we automatically save your previous project keys. This ensures any links, filters, and queries using your previous key continue working.\n\nAdmins can now delete a previous project key from a project so it can be used for a new project.\n\nTo delete a previous project key:\n\nSelect Project settings, then Details.\n\nIn the Previous project keys field, delete the relevant project key.\n\nSelect Save.\n\nWe recommend letting users know before you delete your previous project key so that they can update any links, filters ,or queries using the previous project key.\n\nMore about project keys\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdd and view Smart Links in URL and short text fields. This will apply to your issue, list, board, and backlog views.\n\nFrom your list or issue view, copy a valid URL link into a URL or short text field.\n\nRead more about using Smart Links\n\nCreate action items in Jira issues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThere may be times when you just want a simple to-do list instead of creating subtasks within issues.\n\nYou can now add action items within the description and comments of an issue. This feature lets you use checkboxes to format your text, helping you compile a list of the things that don’t need separate tracking.\n\nMore about action items\n\nTo get started:\n\nNavigate to a Jira issue.\n\nIn the Description field, select Action item (checkbox icon) from the toolbar available in the editor or type [] (open and close square brackets).\n\nType your action.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdd and view Smart Links in URL and short text fields. This will apply to your issue, list, board, and backlog views.\n\nFrom your list or issue view, copy a valid URL link into a URL or short text field.\n\nNew filtering options in your board\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIn business projects, we're adding the ability to filter by parent issues in your board. This will make it easier and simpler to filter by all associated child issues.\n\nFrom the board, select Filter, then scroll to find and select from your Parent filter options.\n\nHighlighted search terms in in-product help\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nWhen you search in in-product help, we'll highlight your search terms in results so you can quickly see how the results relate to the terms you've entered.\n\nTo search in in-product help, select the help (question mark) icon in the navigation and enter your query in the search field.\n\nNote: In-product help is available in many screens in Jira, including in software, service desk, and work management projects. There may be some screens where in-product help isn't available yet.\n\nEdit the name or icon of a business project\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now edit a business project’s name and icon directly in line, without navigating to project settings. Simply select either the name or project from anywhere in the project, make your updates, and confirm.\n\nCreate custom fields while building forms\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdmins in team-managed projects can now create custom fields within a form as they're building the form, without having to go to project settings.\n\nCustomize duration for waiting for a response while running the AWS SSM document and resume rule in case of no response\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen running the AWS SSM document, you can configure the action to wait for a response for a duration of 1 to 15 minutes. Additionally, you can now set the rule to resume even if AWS SSM doesn't return a response within the specified time.\n\nCustomize duration for waiting for a response while running a query in New Relic and resume rule in case of no response\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen running a query in New Relic, you can configure the action to wait for a duration of 1 to 15 minutes.

Additionally, you can now set the rule to resume even if Virtual Machine in Azure doesn't return a response within the specified time.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've made some changes to service management templates when creating a new service project. Only new templates are affected by this change.\n\nThe IT service management template no longer includes problem management, change management, and advanced incident management features. These features are now found in the advanced IT service management template.\n\nThese changes are reflective of our updates to what's included in Jira Service Management's Standard and Premium plans. Read more about updates to Jira Service Management's pricing and packaging.\n\nThe requests beta feature is leaving soon\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re removing the Requests beta feature on October 4, 2024. This feature was intended to make it easy to view your Jira Service Management requests from your Jira Software project, but we’ve found its performance wasn’t quite up to scratch.\n\nIf you’ve participated in the Requests beta in your software project and have been using it, all your request data will still be available in Jira Service Management. You can still work with requests from your software request by implementing one of the alternative options we’ve provided on Atlassian Community.\n\nFilter form-related requests in Jira\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now quickly filter and locate requests linked to a submitted form, without the need to manually search.\n\nTo get started:\n\nOpen Jira and navigate your business project.\n\nGo to the Forms tab.\n\nLocate the recent form.\n\nSelect View submitted.\n\nYou’ll be taken to your list view with the new search filter already applied.\n\nEdit your help center's home page layout and add rich content to it\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWith this release, admins will have more control over their help center's home page, allowing them to tailor it to fit the needs of their audiences. They will be able to:\n\nhide and reorder sections on the home page to create a more organized experience\n\nadd layouts, images, and rich content to make the help center visually engaging and user-friendly.\n\nThis will help admins create a more customized and appealing help center for their different audiences.\n\nNest media and codeblocks in quotes\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve added the capability to nest media (images, videos, etc.) and codeblocks inside of quotes in the editor. This allows for better context when formatting quotes.\n\nMedia in quotes*: Users can now embed images, videos, and other media types within quotes, enhancing visual context.\n\nCodeblocks in quotes*: Codeblocks can now be nested inside quotes, making it easier to reference and highlight code snippets within discussions.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThis update simplifies channel management and enhances the visibility and usage of the virtual agent across your Jira Service Management projects.\n\nStreamlined configuration: For a more efficient admin experience, manage all channel configurations from a single Jira Service Management channel home.\n\nCentralized channel visibility: View all connected channels with the virtual agent in one place.\n\nUnified testing: Test draft intents and AI Answers directly from the web preview, eliminating the need for specific Slack request channels.\n\nRead more about how to use the virtual agent in your customer channels\n\nA new home for help center customization features\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nQuickly access customization options for your help center.

Each is still hyperlinked so you can quickly refresh your memory, and a scroll bar means you still have access to them all.\n\nThis saves on space and helps to reduce page load times too.\n\nRecord or upload Loom videos on a Jira issue\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nUsers can now record Loom videos directly from the Jira issue view, or insert existing Loom videos directly into a Jira issue, ticket description, or comment. If Loom is not an active product on a site, attempting to record a Loom video in the issue view will allow users to activate Loom, or send a request to activate Loom to the site admin.\n\nFrom the + Add menu in a Jira issue, select the Record a Loom video option to record directly into the issue. These Loom videos will appear under a new Loom video section in the Jira issue.\n\nAdding admin controls for the \"Hide unused fields\" feature in Jira\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe're responding to requests from admins who have requested to control the Hide unused fields feature in Jira. So, we've added the ability to globally switch the feature on or off.\n\nTo manage features on your site:\n\nGo to Settings > System.\n\nSelect Edit Settings.\n\nScroll to Options and choose the settings you’d like to turn on or off\n\nSelect Update to save your changes.\n\nCollect higher quality information with business forms\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nGather better quality information with new functionality for business forms.\n\nChoose from more fields including parent, category and people. Have more control by making fields optional or required to submit when building a form. You can also add more detailed guidance for people submitting a form, by adding field descriptions.\n\nManage your form fields\n\nTo find updates to business forms, you’ll need project admin access:\n\nOpen a business project and navigate to Forms in the project navigation.\n\nSelect an existing form or select + Create form\n\nFind all new functionality while building your form.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIt's now easier than ever to connect your source code management tools to your software projects.

Minimize context switching, know the exact development status of work, and more.\n\nCollect work requests with forms for all Jira projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nCollect work requests from stakeholders directly into all Jira projects. Once someone completes your form, this creates an issue ready to be prioritised and worked on straight away.\n\nTo create a Jira form, you’ll need project admin access:\n\nOpen a project, and navigate to Forms in the project navigation.\n\nSelect an existing form, or select + Create form.\n\nHow to create a form.\n\nAn improvement to the Jira search experience\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re boosting performance in the issue navigator by changing how the search field works behind the scenes.\n\nWhen using the search field, results will be based on the Summary, Description and all text custom fields. The Search issues field in the top navigation will also follow this rule.\n\nBefore this change, results were also based in Comments and Worklog, which caused results to be slower to load.\n\nIf you’d prefer to search using text fields, select More + to view additional field filters, then select Text.\n\nTo try it out, go to the issue navigator in your project and select Issues.\n\nView and filter virtual service agent conversations by channel\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nOn the Conversations page in the virtual service agent, you can now see conversations from all of your connected channels (instead of just Slack).\n\nWe've added a Channel column so you can see the source channel at a glance, as well as a filter to narrow down conversations by channel.\n\nRead more about using conversation data to improve your virtual service agent's performance\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now edit the Story points and Story point estimate fields directly in the list view of the issue navigator.\n\nGo to Issues in the project sidebar\n\nSwitch to List view\n\nFind the Story points or Story points estimate columns and update them without opening the issue\n\nCreate embedded release notes with a Confluence template\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now create release notes in an embedded Confluence page using our improved release notes template.\n\nWhen you start the release process, you can create release notes in a Confluence page. Select the issue types and Jira fields you want to add to the template.\n\nThe release notes will open in a new Confluence page that you can edit and share.\n\nAs part of the shutdown of the \"External Assets Platform\", the ability to create, add, or modify \"External Assets Platform\" custom fields has now been removed\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to deliver the most streamlined and integrated service management solution, the ‘External Asset Platform’ will be shut down.\n\nLearn more about the shutdown of the 'External Assets Platform'.\n\nThis change will take place in two stages: currently, we are removing the ability to create new \"External Assets Platform\" custom fields, add these fields to projects, or modify the contents of existing \"External Assets Platform\" custom fields.\n\nUltimately, all existing \"External Assets Platform\" custom fields will be removed, along with any data contained in them. If you have not yet begun backing up your data from your \"External Assets Platform\" custom fields, we recommend you do so immediately using the provided script.\n\nHide unused fields when creating issues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThere can be a lot of fields to scroll through when you’re creating issues, and we know there are many fields that are simply unused.\n\nWe’re introducing a feature that only brings up the fields you actually use. We’ll create a personalized Create issue form for each issue type and project.\n\nAll the fields you don’t use will be hidden in a More fields section, so you'll always be able to interact with them. The feature is continuously learning. If we notice you using a previously unused field, we’ll pull it out of the More fields section for the next time.\n\nWe’ll automatically turn on the feature to hide unused fields when creating issues, but you can manage it by heading to Personal settings and finding to the Jira labs section. From there, you can use the toggle to opt in and out of the feature.\n\nSigning up for Confluence from Jira just got easier\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIf you’re using Jira and don’t have Confluence, you might see a prompt to try it out. If you select this prompt, you will go through a signup flow. Previously, this flow was full-screen and used an older style of Atlassian branding.\n\nThe flow has been updated with new branding. It also opens on a smaller popup screen that overlays your Jira screen.\n\nThe popup will vary depending on which Confluence plan you’re signing up for.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now validate more components in Jira and Confluence automation, helping to ensure your rules are free of errors before you enable them. This feature will improve efficiency and accuracy during rule creation, as you'll no longer need to search for errors yourself before turning on your rule. Please note that some errors may not be identified during the validation process, so we recommend keeping an eye on the audit log to ensure no further errors occur.\n\nTo get started with this change:\n\n1. Navigate to the automation rule builder in Jira or Confluence automation.\n\n2. Create your desired rule.\n\n3. Once you have finished editing your rule, click on the dropdown arrow next to the Turn on rule button.\n\n4. Select Validate rule.\n\n5. We'll advise you if any errors or warnings were found in your rule. Follow the steps provided in the rule builder to fix these.\n\n6. Select Validate rule again to ensure your rule no longer contains any identifiable errors.\n\n7. Once your rule is ready, turn it on.\n\nEfficiency improvements in the calendar view\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIn our ongoing effort to streamline tasks and enhance your experience with the calendar view, we’re rolling out the following improvements:\n\n• Load more issues without pagination — We’ve replaced the page numbers at the bottom of the calendar with a single Load more button. Selecting this will keep currently loaded issues in view while loading the next 50.\n\n• Real-time updates — If you create, update, or delete an issue, other team members viewing the calendar will see those changes in real-time without reloading the page.\n\n• Hide done items via URL — If you switch on the toggle to hide done items, the parameter hideDone=true will be added to the page’s URL. If switched off, the parameter will be removed. You can use these URLs to share exactly what you’re seeing, without unnecessary configuration. This change is only applicable to business projects.\n\n• Manage issue types — While creating issues in the calendar, you’ll notice a new option to Manage types in the issue type dropdown. Selecting this gives you quicker access to the issue type configuration page in project settings. This change is only applicable to software projects (to match existing functionality in business projects).\n\n• Improved sorting — When a day in the calendar contains multiple items, you’ll notice a consistent sorting pattern that better shows the continuity of longer events and prioritises important context like sprints and releases. Sprints will always appear at the top of the day, followed by multi-day events, releases, and single-day events.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, these changes will be available on software projects, business projects, plans, and Jira Service Management.\n\nTo try out these improvements, head to the calendar by going to your project, then select Calendar in the sidebar.\n\nThe 'External Assets Platform' Custom Field now includes a shutdown notice\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThe ‘External Asset Platform’ will be shut down on 17 December 2024 as part of our ongoing efforts to deliver the most streamlined and integrated service management solution.\n\nLearn more about the shutdown of the 'External Assets Platform'.\n\nNow, when you view the 'External Assets Platform' custom field, a DEPRECATED notice will appear in front of the custom field with a warning icon. If you click on the warning icon, you will see additional information and a link to the shutdown notice page that is linked above.\n\nWhen you create a new custom field of the 'External Assets Platform' type, a warning about the shutdown will also be displayed.\n\nFinally, for existing 'External Assets platform' custom fields that appear within Jira issues, a warning icon will appear next to the custom field name. If you hover over the warning icon, you will see additional information about the shutdown.\n\nCollect more relevant work requests with Jira forms\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nCollect only the relevant details from your stakeholders. By creating conditions, you can now show specific questions based on responses to previous questions.\n\nTo begin creating conditions on a form, you’ll need project admin access:\n\nOpen a Jira project and navigate to Forms in the project navigation.\n\nSelect an existing form or select + Create form.\n\nAdd a priority field, or any custom multi-select or single-select fields to the form builder.\n\nSelect that field from the form builder to edit.\n\nSelect Add condition.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe're introducing a new feature to Jira and Confluence automation that allows you to clear all selected filters in the audit log with a click of a button. This change will help you to save time and improve efficiency, as you'll no longer need to manually de-select all the selected filters yourself.\n\nTo start using this feature:\n\nOpen the audit log in either Jira or Confluence automation.\n\nApply any desired date and time filters to the audit log.\n\nOnce you are done with these filters, select the Date and time button.\n\nSelect Clear filter. All selected date and time filters will automatically be de-selected.\n\nYour audit log will now have no date and time filters applied to it.\n\nLearn more about using the audit log in Jira and Confluence automation\n\nChange the status straight from Smart Link list view\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nUpdate the status using a Smart Link list view without the need to open the Jira issue.\n\nWhat is Smart Link list view?\n\nWhile viewing Jira issues in Smart Link list view, select the status from one of the items. Once the dropdown appears, you can update the status straight from the cell.\n\nChange the assignee straight from Smart Link list view\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nChange the assignee using a Smart Link list without the need to open the issue.\n\nWhat is Smart Link list view?\n\nWhile viewing Jira issues in Smart Link list view, select assignee from one of the items. Once the dropdown appears, you can change the assignee straight from the cell.\n\nIntroducing 'work' as the new collective term for items tracked in Jira Cloud\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nAs more teams make Jira their home for work, we’re committed to improving the language in our tools to better reflect the diverse ways you define and manage your work.\n\nWe’re introducing work as the new collective term for all items tracked in Jira. We’re also exploring ways to incorporate the language you use for your own work types.\n\n• Read more about these changes on the Atlassian Community.\n\nThis change builds upon our previous efforts to reduce the use of 'issue' terminology in Jira.\n\nChange the priority straight from Smart Link list view\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nUpdate the priority of Jira issues straight from Smart Link list view.\n\nWhat is Smart Link list view?\n\nWhile viewing Jira issues in Smart Link list view, select the priority from one of the items. Once the dropdown appears, you can update the priority straight from the cell.\n\nChoose how long done items remain on your Jira board\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nOn Jira business projects, you now have more control over what work you can see from the Board. Once you move a work item into a done column, they will now remain visible from that column for the chosen number of days. After this, you can find those work items from other views such as the List.\n\nTo choose how long done items remain on your board:\n\nOpen a Jira business project.\n\nSelect Board from the project view navigation.\n\nSelect More to open the View options.\n\nSelect Hide done items after.\n\nChoose from the available number of days.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re updating the filter name searches in dashboards and the filters page to provide consistent and predictable results.\n\nPreviously, filter name searches used the JQL text search syntax, which produced inconsistent results when the search term contained certain special characters. Now, search results will display all filters that contain the search term.\n\nThe 'Show sum' functionality has moved in Assets in Jira Service Management\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nWe've made a few minor changes to the feature in Assets in Jira Service Management that allows you automatically calculate and display the sum of multiple 'Float' or 'Integer' attributes.\n\nThis feature used to be available as a setting in the Attribute screen, visible to all users. Now the feature is available in the List view > Columns screen, and can be configured individually for each user.\n\nIf you like, take a further look at the documentation here.\n\nJira\n\nROLLING OUT NEW THIS WEEK\n\nWe've changed the way that projects linked to your rules appear in the automation audit log, to improve both usability and accessibility. Instead of simply displaying the ID numbers of projects at the top of the audit log, any projects related to your rule will now appear as interactive links. These links will be located at the bottom of the audit log under a clear heading, making it much easier to find the projects that each of your rules will execute in. Please note that only projects scoped to your rule, as well as related issue conditions and issue branches, will appear here as links.\n\nTo get started with this change:\n\nNavigate to automation in either Jira or Confluence.\n\nOpen the audit log.\n\nSelect your desired rule.\n\nSelect Show more.\n\nUnder the Projects section, you will be able to view all projects scoped to your rule, plus any related conditions or branches.\n\nLearn more about the audit log in Atlassian automation\n\nSummary view now available in software projects\n\nNEW THIS WEEK\n\nProject summaries are now available across all Jira Cloud software projects! The _s_ummary view helps you monitor your project's progress by giving you a high-level overview of your team’s work. It includes a snapshot of your project's status, recent activity, priorities, team workload distribution, and epic progress.\n\nAll Jira software projects have the summary view enabled by default. To view a project summary, navigate to your project, and then select Summary.\n\nRead more about the summary view\n\nROLLING OUT NEW THIS WEEK\n\nTo help keep your company-managed projects on track, we now show the due date field by default on board and backlog cards. The due date appears if at least one card has the due date set.\n\nYou no longer have to manually add this field to the card layout in Board settings. But if you’d like to hide this field, select the View settings icon and toggle off the Due date field.\n\nNew and improved tables in all rich text fields\n\nROLLING OUT NEW THIS WEEK\n\nWe’ve improved the experience of creating and customizing tables in all rich text fields (including description and comments) in an issue, matching the capabilities of the full-page editor in Confluence.\n\nControl what you see in your products\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nProduct recommendations now have controls, so now you can dismiss them or learn more about why you’re seeing them. These controls are being added to the recommendations in the app switcher menu which means you'll have more control and receive better product recommendations.\n\nYou can select the three dots next to the recommendation to learn why we have recommended it or to dismiss it entirely.\n\nThe recommendation controls will first be released to both Free and Standard teams of up to 50 users. Note: Only admins will be able to add a new product by clicking on the recommendation.\n\nColourful categories\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nProject admins can now assign colours to categories from the list view in Jira.\n\nTemplate bundles in the project create page\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nEffortlessly create between 2 to 6 projects at once, with bundles. We're helping streamline your project creation process and minimizing the need for repetitive manual tasks. Whether you're working in Jira or Jira Service Management, bundles guarantee a smooth project creation experience.\n\nChoose from two pre-set bundles: the Marketing or the IT team bundle. And if they don't fit your requirements, you have the flexibility to customize and create your own bundle.\n\nThere are a few ways you can create a bundle, one way is to:\n\nSelect the plus icon + in the project sidebar\n\nChoose More templates from the dropdown\n\nSelect Bundles\n\nAnother way to create a bundle is to:\n\nSelect Projects > Create project in the top navigation bar\n\nSelect Bundles\n\nCompany-managed projects: Create, edit, and delete columns directly on the board\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIf you want to quickly add or update a column on your board, you don’t need to go far. You can now create, rename, move, set constraints for, and delete columns without leaving the board. You’ll still have the ability to do all of the above in your board’s settings page, but if you’ve only got time for a quick fix, we’ve now got you covered!\n\nIf you’re a project or board admin for the board you want to update, you can try the following changes:\n\nTo create a column, select the + icon to the right of all columns.\n\nTo rename a column, select its name to edit directly.\n\nTo move a column, select its top, then drag the column to its new position.\n\nTo set column constraints, right-click its name or hover to select more actions (•••) > Set column limit.\n\nTo delete a column, right-click its name or hover to select more actions (•••) > Delete.\n\nImproved editing experience for Queues\n\nWe've made improvements to the \"Basic\" editing experience for Queues in Jira Service Management. The update includes improved dropdown fields and the ability to select multiple options for ordering your queue.\n\nView high-level work across multiple teams with a new template\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nUse the new cross-team planning template to get a high-level view of work across multiple teams.\n\nCreate Confluence whiteboards directly from your Jira backlog\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWith Confluence whiteboards, you can plan freely and execute quickly. Create a whiteboard directly from your Jira backlog, copy backlog issues to the whiteboard, and plan however you want.\n\nHere are some suggestions for things you can do with Confluence whiteboards:\n\nUse award-winning templates such as a prioritizing and planning matrix\n\nImport Jira issues directly into your new planning whiteboard\n\nLink sticky notes and issues to show dependencies and timelines\n\nTurn sticky notes into Jira issues\n\nEngage teammates with real-time, group editing\n\nCollaborate using stamps, timers, and more\n\nIf an admin has three or more issues in their backlog, they'll see the button that allows them to add Confluence and start using a whiteboard. Once a team has Confluence, anyone with access to Confluence — including admins and end users — will see the button on their backlog that allows them to create a whiteboard.\n\nYou can remove this button anytime by turning off all product recommendations at in your Jira settings. Note: if you add Confluence and then turn off product recommendations, you will lose this button.\n\nSite optimizer now archives projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou've heard of the Site optimizer (if you haven't, here's some reading you'll love); now we've made it better. It now allows you to clean out old projects as well as issues, project role permissions, and custom fields.\n\nWhen looking at projects that can be deleted, you can select projects to clear out from your site based on those that:\n\nhave no issues or\n\nhaven't been updated in a certain amount of time\n\nFrom here, you can choose to either archive them or send them to the trash.\n\nAccessibility improvements in the project timeline\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nOver the next few weeks, we'll be shipping a few accessibility improvements when viewing the project timeline. These changes make it easier for those using assistive technologies (such as screen readers) to track their work using the timeline view.\n\nSelf-request access to Confluence via a prompt on Jira 'Your work' page\n\nCurrent Jira users aren't aware they can request access to join their company or team spaces in Confluence.\n\nNow, when a user visits their Jira 'Your work' page, they will see a prompt allowing them to request access to Confluence if:\n\nThey don't have access to Confluence\n\nThey have team members or collaborators using Confluence\n\nThey have the ability to request access to products\n\nUsers can set a 30-day reminder to request access via 'Remind me later' or permanently dismiss prompts via 'Not interested'.\n\nBulk duplicate and delete components in the automation rulebuilder\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe're introducing a new feature that allows you to select multiple components at once in the automation rulebuilder and either duplicate or delete them. This change affects both Jira and Confluence, and should help to improve efficiency in the rulebuilder, as you'll no longer need to select each component one at a time to edit them.\n\nTo select and edit multiple components at once:\n\nHold down the Ctrl / Command key and click the left button on your mouse or touchpad.\n\nSelect the number of components you want to duplicate or delete.\n\nOnce the components are selected, you can use the new menu to duplicate or delete them.\n\nSave automation rules in a disabled state\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe're introducing a new feature that allows you to save automation rules in a disabled state, which means they are draft rules that you can come back to edit and turn on later. Previously, rules couldn't be saved as drafts and had to be turned on immediately after creation. This new feature provides more freedom for users and allows you to more effectively edit and refine your rules before turning them on.\n\nTo get started with this change:\n\nOpen either Jira or Confluence automation.\n\nSelect Create rule and create your desired rule in the rulebuilder.\n\nClick on the dropdown arrow next to the Turn on rule button.\n\nSelect Save rule without enabling.\n\nYou'll now be able to see the draft rule under your Rules list in automation. It will appear as 'Disabled'.\n\nWhen you're ready to turn on the rule, move the Enabled toggle to the right so a tick appears.\n\nYour rule is now turned on and ready to use.\n\nImprovements to the workflow editor\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've updated the workflow diagram in company-managed projects to be faster and more accessible.\n\nConnect issues to goals in your Jira list\n\nUse the Goals field in Jira to connect your team’s work to higher-level business objectives. Goals help your team understand how their efforts drive impact and help leaders manage dependencies and mitigate risk. All issue types can now be linked to a goal in software projects, business projects, and plans.\n\nEnable the Goals field to show as a column in your list. Once enabled, you can create goals, link issues to the goals they contribute to, and filter issues in your list based on goals.\n\nHow to link and unlink goals to issues\n\nPlan Timeline header issue create improvement\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now create issue types directly on your plan timeline without hunting through the work hierarchy level.\n\nFrom the Timeline header create button, you'll be prompted to select a project, which will then display all possible child issue types. Save time and start creating new work inside your plan with less hassle.\n\nNew rules coming to the New Workflow Editor\n\nIn the new workflow editor, you will soon be able to use the following rules:\n\nSet issue security level\n\nValidate that an issue has a specific status\n\nRestrict which users can transition issues between statuses\n\nAll of these were available in the old workflow editor before, but now you can also use them in the new workflow editor.\n\nImproved performance and reliability for CSV exports\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIf you need to export your Jira issues, you’ll notice a faster and smoother experience due to the following improvements:\n\nSpeed and reliability — the export process is faster and can handle a large number of fields and extensive data sets\n\nTracking and control — you can monitor the progress of your export, and cancel if needed\n\nTo try it out, go to the Issues page in your project. Select Export, then select a CSV export option.\n\nNote that only one CSV export can be processed at a time.\n\nNew validation for fields in the workflow editor\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've revamped how field validation works when building workflows for company-managed projects, as well as introduced this feature to team-managed projects.\n\nWhen building a project workflow, validators let you specify criteria for when an issue can move through a particular transition.\n\nGo to Project settings > Workflow to get started, then follow these instructions to add validators depending on your project type:\n\nAdd or edit rule to a team-managed project\n\nAdd or edit a rule for a company-managed project\n\nIf you're already using validators for a company-managed project, don't worry, your existing rules still work and are fully compatible with the new experience.\n\nMaintain approval history when bypassing approvals\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThis change allows users to bypass approvals while preserving approval data, preventing data loss and improving history tracking.\n\nDuring an approval state of a workflow, an issue can't transition to the approved or declined status until all approval decisions are finalized.\n\nHowever, transitions other than ‘Approve’ or ‘Decline’ can be used to manually transition issues and bypass the approval state. Previously, if you transitioned an issue’s approval state to a status other than ‘Approve’ or ‘Decline’, it deleted the approval along with any recorded approver decisions from the database.\n\nAs part of this change:\n\nif an issue’s approval state is transitioned to a status other than ‘Approve’ or ‘Decline’, it will be recorded as a ‘canceled approval’\n\nwe preserve any active approvals (including approver decisions) that exist for an approval state when an approval state has been bypassed\n\nall approvals data will be retained in the approvals activity history\n\nJQL queries will return issues with approvals activity, even if the approval is canceled.\n\nTip: To ensure your approval state status and approver decisions are clearly conveyed to your customers in the portal activity log, check how your workflow statuses will appear to customers in the portal based on the display names assigned to each workflow status.\n\nFrom your project settings, go to Request types.\n\nSelect the name of the request type you want to modify, then select the Workflow statuses tab.\n\nReview and update the Status name to show customer for each workflow status.\n\nSpeed up your next Jira import with configuration files\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen importing multiple projects using CSV files, a configuration file can help you save your preferences, such as project settings, Jira fields, and user information, and use it for future imports. In the new import experience, select Download a configuration file at the end of your next Jira project import. Upload it with a CSV file in another import to bring in the same preferences without the hassle of selecting the same fields once again.\n\nTo use a configuration file during an import:\n\nFrom the navigation bar, select Projects > Create project > Import data.\n\nSelect the app from which you’d like to import your data from. If you can’t find your app in the list, select CSV to use any CSV file to import your data.\n\nIf you select Asana, ClickUp, monday, or Trello, you can directly import data without a CSV file.\n\nSelect Upload a configuration file (optional) and upload the configuration file you downloaded from a previous import.\n\nSelect Next and continue with the import.\n\nRead about configuration files\n\nPriorities page refreshed and more accessible\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAdding priorities to work communicates urgency and brings focus to the most important tasks.\n\nUse the refreshed Priorities page to add, delete, and re-order priorities. You can also add priority names and colors and upload icons.\n\nTo see the list of priorities on your Jira site, go to Jira settings, then issues, then priorities.\n\nIntroducing a brand new toolbar for bulk actions\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re introducing a toolbar in the backlog so users can update multiple issues even more seamlessly.\n\nTo use the new toolbar:\n\nSelect multiple issues from the backlog or list. You can either:\n\nuse the issue checkboxes\n\nhold Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac) while selecting issues\n\nhold the Shift key to select a group of adjacent issues\n\nThe new toolbar will appear. You can either select Edit fields to make edits to fields in your issues or Change status to transition your issues.\n\nPlans in Jira - Change the duration of the program board\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe're a few months into the Program board Open Beta, and we've gotten a lot of feedback about how to improve it. One of the most requested improvements was the ability to change the number of sprints shown on the board and the duration of them.\n\nGuess what we're releasing today?\n\nThat's right: when you create a new Program board, you can now change:\n\nthe duration of each column to between one and four weeks\n\nthe total number of columns to show between four and 13\n\nUsing these, you can adjust the total duration of your board to be as little as seven weeks and as much as 16.\n\nHaven't met the Program board yet? Allow me to introduce you.\n\nAdd external sprints to your plan\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now assign issues to any sprint in your site regardless of whether it's included in your plan. This allows planners to assign work that belongs to teams outside their plan without leaving the page. Your plan refers to these as external sprints, and adds the EXT. lozenge next to their name.\n\nExternal sprints are not added to your plan when you assign issues to them. To use the more complex sprint-based planning capabilities such as capacity planning, you'll need to add the board in which that sprint was created as an issue source of your plan.\n\nJira Plans - Dependencies on the Program board, and the end of Open Beta!\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAs of today, the Program board is leaving Open Beta and becoming a full-fledged feature of Plans! To mark the occasion, we're shipping a highly-requested feature: dependency management on the Program board.\n\nRead our post in the Atlassian Community about this.\n\nWith this change, planners can now:\n\nfilter the Program board to show on or off-track dependencies\n\nshow lines between dependencies\n\ncreate new dependencies from the board\n\nand more! See the full depth of these changes in our documentation.\n\nInsight settings are being removed from software projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAs part of our ongoing effort to simplify project settings for admins, we're removing the option to configure insight settings in Jira software projects. Insights will continue to show as normal, but board admins and project admins won't be able to enable or disable specific insights, and any insights that were previously disabled will now be enabled. This means that all insights available in a project will be visible to any user who selects Insights from the board or backlog.\n\nTo send us feedback about this change:\n\nIn your Jira software project, select Board or Backlog.\n\nSelect Insights.\n\nScroll to the bottom of your Insights and select Give feedback.\n\nNow it’s easier to add a Loom video to Jira issues\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nLoom is a video tool that allows people to easily record their screen, add audio commentary, and quickly edit the clips.\n\nIf you’re using Jira you may see a recommendation to try Loom out while adding a comment or editing a description in a Jira issue. The recommendation will only show on ‘Bug’ issues.\n\nAdmins and end users will see this Loom recommendation. If you have permission to add new products, you can add Loom from the recommendation. If you don’t have permission to add new products, you can send your admin a request to add Loom from the recommendation.\n\nYou can dismiss the recommendation anytime. If you have Loom already, you won’t see the recommendations at all.\n\nView settings and bug fixes for calendars in business projects\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe're rolling out the following improvements to the calendar experience in business projects.\n\nView settings\n\nWe’ve added a View settings button to make it easier to navigate, stay informed, and customize your view. Now you can:\n\n• Quickly open issues from the sidebar\n\n• Hide done items\n\n• Show or hide issue keys\n\n• Show or hide weekends\n\n• Choose which day the week starts on\n\n• Show software release dates\n\nBug fixes\n\n• You can now unschedule work even if the schedule work panel is empty.\n\n• Summaries are no longer truncated.\n\nTo try out these improvements, head to the calendar by going to your business project, then select Calendar in the navigation.\n\nQuick-add buttons decluttered in the issue view\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve consolidated all the quick-add buttons to declutter the issue view, enhance clarity, and scale. You’ll now find buttons, such as \"Attach” and “Linked issues”, under the Add button, and buttons from your third-party integrations under Apps.\n\nRead more about the changes\n\nConnect issues to higher-level goals in the issue view\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now align your team’s work to higher-level goals directly in the issue view. Goals help your team understand how their efforts drive impact and help leaders manage dependencies and mitigate risk.\n\nIf you linked an issue to a goal before this change, the Goals field will be automatically enabled in the issue view. This change will replace the previous experience of connecting goals in the issue view.\n\nIf you haven’t linked an issue to a goal before, you’ll need to enable the Goals field for an issue type.\n\nTo enable the Goals field:\n\nOpen an issue of the type you'd like to add the Goals field to.\n\nSelect Configure at the bottom-right of the issue (near the created and updated dates).\n\nIn the Fields panel, search for Goals.\n\nDrag the Goals field to the Context fields section.\n\nSelect Save changes to finalize.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou’ll now get work suggestions in Jira when new comments are added to your open pull request since the last time you got this suggestion for the same pull request. When you select your avatar on the board, any available suggestions will automatically appear on the work suggestions panel.\n\nThe availability of this suggestion type depends on the source code management tool you’re using and its connection with Jira. The new suggestions will be available in scrum and kanban projects in Jira.\n\nRead more about work suggestions in Jira\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve made some changes to the way you create linked issues in business projects.\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nShare your plan using the same Smart links you'd find in the rest of Jira. To see how your favorite sharing method might have changed, take a peek at our documentation.\n\nUsing the Share button on your plan, you can now:\n\nshare it with other Jira users or people with whom work in Slack (if connected)\n\nembed your plan in another Atlassian product such as Confluence\n\nexport your data as a .csv file\n\ncreate a static image of your plan\n\nA lot of these were available before, but this new way of sharing them is easier, faster, and more flexible.\n\nCreate a child issue from your plan timeline\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now create a child issue type directly on your plan timeline without hunting through the work hierarchy level. Using the inline menu above the issue, you'll be prompted to select a project, which will then display all possible child issue types. Save time and start creating new work inside your plan with less hassle.\n\nNew additions to the More (•••) menu on an issue\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen viewing the timeline in business projects, you can now change parent issue, edit an issue's start and end dates, and link to to issues using the More (•••) menu on the issue.\n\nPlans Group now displays related child work items\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWhen grouping, child issues will now appear under their parent’s group, regardless of their assigned group. This change to the plan timeline behaviour aligns with the list view and project timeline.\n\nCreate issues faster by hiding unused fields\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nCreating issues in Jira is now easier and faster with the ability to focus on the fields you use the most. We’ve added a new setting that lets you quickly hide any fields you haven’t used in the past 30 days. This only updates your personal settings, so it won’t affect anyone else on your team.\n\nTo try it out:\n\nSelect Create to create a new issue in Jira.\n\nSelect More actions (•••), then select the toggle next to Hide unused fields to turn the feature on or off.\n\nImprovements to the audit log in Jira and Confluence automation\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've added new features and improved existing ones in the automation audit log. These improvements make it easier for you to navigate, filter and use the audit log in both Jira and Confluence automation.\n\nTo access the audit log:\n\nNavigate to automation in either Jira or Confluence.\n\nOpen the audit log.\n\nSelect a rule you'd like to check. For example, you may want to check a rule that contains errors.\n\nSelect Show more to view the details of your rule and how it ran.\n\nYou can now read your selected rule's audit log.\n\nCreate Google Docs in your Google Drive with Jira and Confluence automation\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’re introducing a new component to Jira and Confluence automation that allows you to create a Google Doc in your Google Drive by simply executing a rule. This feature will help you to create Google Docs more quickly and easily, as you’ll no longer need to create them manually - Atlassian automation can do it for you!\n\nTo get started with this change:\n\nNavigate to the automation rule builder in Jira or Confluence.\n\nSelect a trigger for your rule.\n\nSelect the Create Doc in Google Drive action and add it to your rule.\n\nSelect a Google Drive folder for your Google Doc to be placed in. Your Doc will be placed in your My Drive folder if you don't have permission to select a location for it.\n\nAdd a title and any body content you want your Google Doc to contain.\n\nAdd any other desired components to your rule.\n\nOnce you've edited and finalized your rule, turn it on.\n\nYour rule is now ready to go.\n\nEpic Link and Parent Link changes no longer show in the audit logs\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAs part of our larger stream of work towards deprecating the Epic Link and Parent Link fields (which you can read about in our documentation as well as our updates in our Community space), changes to these fields no longer generate a change record. On issues, this means that changes made to the Epic Link and the Parent Link no longer show in the issue's History tab.\n\nChanges to these fields are also no longer being communicated via the API, which we announced in the developer community.\n\nNew restrictions in the new workflow editor experience\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe've added two more transition rules to the new workflow editor experience. Prior to this change, these rules only existed in the old workflow editor.\n\nBackground and card cover images from Unsplash\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now personalize your project background and card covers with a range of beautiful images and pictures from Unsplash.\n\nTo add a project background (admins only):\n\nSelect the paint bucket icon next to the project name.\n\nSelect Photos.\n\nSearch Unsplash and select an image.\n\nTo add a card cover (all users):\n\nSelect the three dots (...) next to the card name.\n\nSelect Edit cover.\n\nSelect Photos.\n\nSearch Unsplash and select an image.\n\nMap data to Jira issue types to organize your project better\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nIn the new import experience, we're adding a capability for administrators to set up[ issue types|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/what-are-issue-types/] and hierarchies. This can help you categorize and organize your team’s work by either assigning Jira issue types (epic, task, story, bug, and/or subtask) or creating custom issue types before importing.\n\nWhen importing data, map column headers from your CSV file to issue type, issue ID, and parent fields. In the next screen (Map values to issue types), you can map the values within the selected issue type column to Jira issue types or create custom issue types.\n\nJira Admin - User filtering for User Picker (multiple users) custom field type\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nThis update is based on a feedback ticket: JRACLOUD-40963 - Allow user filtering for User Picker (multiple users) custom field type\n\nWith this change, administrators can limit which users appear in User picker (multiple users) custom fields based on groups and project roles. This behavior mimics the same function found in Data Center versions of Jira.\n\nSee how to limit users in User Picker (multiple users) custom fields.\n\nManage deadlines and overdue work easily from your Jira board\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nTrack and manage approaching deadlines easily via the Sprint Insights on your Jira board. With the new Due tab in the Issues for attention widget, you can quickly view overdue and upcoming work items, tailored to your board type.\n\nFor scrum boards, you can view overdue issues, and upcoming issues due within the current sprint. For kanban boards, you can view overdue issues, and upcoming issues that are due within the next 2 weeks.\n\nTo try it out on any software project:\n\nOpen a Kanban or Scrum board.\n\nSelect Insights.\n\nLocate the Issues for attention widget.\n\nSelect the Due tab.\n\nJira Admin - Restrict who can change an issue's status\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nWhen configuring workflows, you can now restrict who can transition an issue's status. This was a rule in the old workflow that we've ported into the new workflow.\n\nRead more about this configuration\n\nImprove issue description clarity with AI\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nUse Atlassian Intelligence to add clear, consistent structure to your Jira issue descriptions.\n\nOnce you have added all the details to include in your description, AI can restructure it into meaningful sections based on the issue type, including:\n\nUser story, context and acceptance criteria (for stories)\n\nImpact, expected behaviour, and workarounds (for bugs)\n\nObjectives, scope, and risks (for epics).\n\nThe more detail you include in your description to start, the more complete the improved description will be.\n\nTo get started:\n\nWhile editing your description, select Writing assistant.\n\nSelect Improve description.\n\nAtlassian Intelligence will restructure your description and, when you’re happy, you can select Replace to add it to your issue.\n\nDependency column label changes to Blocks and Blocked by\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve changed the plan dependency view column labels from ‘Incoming dependencies’ and ‘Outgoing dependencies’ to Blocked by and Blocks.\n\nWe made this change to promote better visibility of the label, which was always cropped due to its length. The long label was a problem for a lot of customers during recent customer testing and investigation. The new label reflects the default name for issue link types that can be added as dependencies, and it aligns with the dependency behaviour in plans, even if another link type name is chosen. We also widened the column length.\n\nWe’ve added a new Jira product roadmap template\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nIf you’re creating a project in Jira you might see a new template recommended in the ‘Made for you’ template section.\n\nThe new template is for Jira Product Discovery and it’s called “Product roadmap”. You can use the template to create custom roadmaps and share your plans with anyone.\n\nAnyone who has the ability to create a project may see this template recommendation. You’ll have to add Jira Product Discovery to use it. End users will have to request to add Jira Product Discovery from their admins. Admins can just add Jira Product Discovery and then go on to use the template.\n\nIf you already have Jira Product Discovery you won’t see the template recommendation in the ‘Made for you’ section. If you’re an admin you can turn off recommendations like these within admin.atlassian.com.\n\nPlans summary page visual refresh\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nFeast your eyes on our new look and feel that's now applied to the summary screen.\n\nSelf-request access to Confluence via an in-product prompt\n\nCurrent Jira users aren't aware they can request access to join their company or team spaces in Confluence.\n\nNow, when a user signs in to Jira, they will see a prompt allowing them to request access to Confluence if:\n\nThey don't have access to Confluence\n\nThey have the ability to request access to products\n\nUsers can set a 30-day reminder to request access via 'Remind me later' or permanently dismiss prompts via 'Not interested'.\n\nImport CSV data into service projects with ease\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWith the new import experience, you can easily transfer information from CSV files into Jira Service Management, saving time and effort.\n\nTo import data into a new Jira Service Management project from a CSV file :\n\nSelect Projects > Create projects > Import data on the sidebar.\n\nSelect CSV to use any CSV file to import your data.\n\nImprovements to how fields display in custom tabs in the issue view\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nWe’ve made improvements to how fields display in custom tabs on the issue view.\n\nPreviously when configuring a request type in Jira Service Management, if a field was added to both the request form and to a custom tab when configuring your issue layout screen, it would always display on the issue view as part of the request form - not inside a tab. Now these fields will always display in the custom tab in the issue view, honouring the configuration of your issue layout screens.\n\nRead more about adding fields to custom tabs on issue view\n\nThe Assets object field will only display the label of an object when viewed from within the portal in Jira Service Management\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nWhen you display an object in the Assets object field in Jira Service Management, you can also select one or more attributes in the User Interaction panel that will appear after the label of the object. You could use this feature to display - for example - the date the object was last modified, or the manufacturer of a piece of equipment.\n\nThese attribute values originally appeared in the search results and as part of the selected items. We will continue to show these in the search results, but this was too much detail to appear in the selected items, so now the Assets object field will only show the label when you select an item in the object picker in the portal.\n\nThis change won't affect the Assets object fields anywhere else in Jira Service Management.\n\nUse Atlassian Intelligence to create issues (beta) from Slack\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now use Atlassian Intelligence (AI) to create Jira issues directly from Slack messages and threads. AI uses the context of your conversations to generate the summary and description, enabling you to create issues faster.\n\nFind out how to use Atlassian Intelligence to create issues from Slack\n\nTo use Atlassian Intelligence to create an issue from Slack:\n\nInstall the Jira Cloud app for Slack.\n\nGo to a Slack message or thread.\n\nSelect More actions, then select Create issue from Jira Cloud.\n\nChoose a Site and Project.\n\nSelect Use Atlassian Intelligence to generate the summary and description.\n\nComplete other fields as necessary and select Submit.\n\nMore historical data available in velocity charts\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nVelocity charts in Jira now show data from more sprints, giving you a clearer picture of your team's productivity over a longer period of time. We've also added an average line so you can easily track your team's average output at a glance. Read more about the velocity chart\n\nTo view the velocity chart:\n\nStart in your Jira software project.\n\nSelect Reports.\n\nSelect Velocity report if you're in a team-managed project, or Velocity chart in a company-managed project.\n\nJira Service Management\n\nJira Service Desk is now Jira Service Management! We’re in the process of rolling out some exciting new features for all users. Learn more about these new features.\n\nROLLING OUT NEW THIS WEEK\n\nWe've changed the way that projects linked to your rules appear in the automation audit log, to improve both usability and accessibility. Instead of simply displaying the ID numbers of projects at the top of the audit log, any projects related to your rule will now appear as interactive links. These links will be located at the bottom of the audit log under a clear heading, making it much easier to find the projects that each of your rules will execute in. Please note that only projects scoped to your rule, as well as related issue conditions and issue branches, will appear here as links.\n\nTo get started with this change:\n\nNavigate to automation in either Jira or Confluence.\n\nOpen the audit log.\n\nSelect your desired rule.\n\nSelect Show more.\n\nUnder the Projects section, you will be able to view all projects scoped to your rule, plus any related conditions or branches.\n\nLearn more about the audit log in Atlassian automation\n\nGet an overview of your project with the Summary page\n\nROLLING OUT NEW THIS WEEK\n\nGain insights into your team’s workload and results with a project level dashboard to streamline work tracking and management.\n\nThe summary page gives you an overview of key metrics across your project such as the number of work items completed, updated, created, or due in the last 7 days.\n\nIt also contains helpful visualizations such as an overview of recent activity in your project, and summaries of issue status, priority and work types.\n\nThis feature is still in progress, and you can use our first version though the Feature lab!\n\nHead to your Project settings and go to the Features page.\n\nLook for the Feature lab heading and find the Project summary toggle.\n\nUse the toggle to turn on the feature.\n\nOnce it's on, you'll see Summary appear in your project navigation and you'll be able to use your dashboards to learn all about your project.\n\nNew and improved tables in all rich text fields\n\nROLLING OUT NEW THIS WEEK\n\nWe’ve improved the experience of creating and customizing tables in all rich text fields (including description and comments) in an issue, matching the capabilities of the full-page editor in Confluence.\n\nControl what you see in your products\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nProduct recommendations now have controls, so now you can dismiss them or learn more about why you’re seeing them. These controls are being added to the recommendations in the app switcher menu which means you'll have more control and receive better product recommendations.\n\nYou can select the three dots next to the recommendation to learn why we have recommended it or to dismiss it entirely.\n\nThe recommendation controls will first be released to both Free and Standard teams of up to 50 users. Note: Only admins will be able to add a new product by clicking on the recommendation.\n\nChat in Slack: Emoji shortcuts are now powered by Jira automation\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nEmoji shortcuts, based off Halp’s legacy recipes, now use Jira automation’s powerful no-code engine. With this change, admins can manage all automation rules in one place and emoji reactions can be used to edit issues created by Assist in Slack — all allowing for a simpler configuration experience.\n\nIf your projects have custom emoji rules, you have until June 4, 2024, to set up similar ones in automation. After that date, the emoji shortcut feature in chat settings will no longer function.\n\nFind out more in our Community blog\n\nBefore you start setting up your new automation rules, keep in mind:\n\nThe ticket emoji shortcut used to create issues isn’t affected by this change, so you don’t need to set this up in automation.\n\nYou need to set up the eyes emoji shortcut, which assigns agents to issues. Tip: Use the template from the Emoji shortcuts tab in chat settings to quickly set up this automation.\n\nTo set up emoji rules in automation:\n\nFrom your project settings, select Automation.\n\nSelect Create rule.\n\nSelect Emoji reaction to Slack message as your trigger*.*\n\nSelect Turn on rule, name your rule, and then Turn on rule again to save.\n\nTo help test your new emoji rules, you can now turn off emoji shortcuts in chat without deleting them:\n\nSet up your emoji rule in automation.\n\nFrom the Emoji shortcuts tab in chat settings, find the rule to turn off.\n\nUse the toggle to turn off the rule.\n\nTest to your satisfaction.\n\nData limits for object schemas in Assets\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nAssets in Jira Service Management is a database and so requires a combination of good data modeling and a great deal of processing power to handle large amounts of data. Here are recommendations for how to structure your data for Assets schemas.\n\nSee also: How to build an effective ITAM schema structure.\n\nFor this reason, we have introduced limitations on how many objects, attributes, and attribute characters can be stored inside schemas within each individual Assets in Jira Service Management site. Read more about how much data you can store in Assets.\n\nExceeding these limits can cause performance and reliability issues, therefore each site cannot create further items once they reach the limit. You can find out how many objects your site currently contains using the feature usage screen. Read more about how to track your usage.\n\nImproved editing experience for Queues\n\nWe've made improvements to the \"Basic\" editing experience for Queues in Jira Service Management. The update includes improved dropdown fields and the ability to select multiple options for ordering your queue.\n\nSelf-request access to Confluence via a prompt on Jira 'Your work' page\n\nCurrent Jira users aren't aware they can request access to join their company or team spaces in Confluence.\n\nNow, when a user visits their Jira 'Your work' page, they will see a prompt allowing them to request access to Confluence if:\n\nThey don't have access to Confluence\n\nThey have team members or collaborators using Confluence\n\nThey have the ability to request access to products\n\nUsers can set a 30-day reminder to request access via 'Remind me later' or permanently dismiss prompts via 'Not interested'.\n\nUse Atlassian Intelligence to draft a reply\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nYou can now use Atlassian Intelligence to draft replies (beta) for your customers. The replies will be based on comments added by agents while resolving similar requests.\n\nTo use Atlassian Intelligence to draft a reply:\n\nSelect any issue from Queues.\n\nSelect Add internal note or Reply to customer.\n\nSelect Atlassian Intelligence from the toolbar, and then select Draft Reply. Alternatively, use /draftreply.\n\nYou can copy, insert, or edit the reply as needed.\n\nMaintain approval history when bypassing approvals\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nThis change allows users to bypass approvals while preserving approval data, preventing data loss and improving history tracking.\n\nDuring an approval state of a workflow, an issue can't transition to the approved or declined status until all approval decisions are finalized.\n\nHowever, transitions other than ‘Approve’ or ‘Decline’ can be used to manually transition issues and bypass the approval state. Previously, if you transitioned an issue’s approval state to a status other than ‘Approve’ or ‘Decline’, it deleted the approval along with any recorded approver decisions from the database.\n\nAs part of this change:\n\nif an issue’s approval state is transitioned to a status other than ‘Approve’ or ‘Decline’, it will be recorded as a ‘canceled approval’\n\nwe preserve any active approvals (including approver decisions) that exist for an approval state when an approval state has been bypassed\n\nall approvals data will be retained in the approvals activity history\n\nJQL queries will return issues with approvals activity, even if the approval is canceled.\n\nTip: To ensure your approval state status and approver decisions are clearly conveyed to your customers in the portal activity log, check how your workflow statuses will appear to customers in the portal based on the display names assigned to each workflow status.\n\nFrom your project settings, go to Request types.\n\nSelect the name of the request type you want to modify, then select the Workflow statuses tab.\n\nReview and update the Status name to show customer for each workflow status.\n\nAdd permissions to detail fields for customers and entitlements\n\nROLLING OUT\n\nJira admins can now configure view and edit permissions for customer and organization detail fields in projects with the Customer and organization profiles feature enabled. Permissions can also be set for entitlement detail fields in projects with the Products and entitlements feature enabled.\n\nTo manage permissions for a detail field:\n\nSelect Actions (•••) next to the detail field.\n\nSelect Manage permissions in the dropdown menu.\n\nChoose your permissions.\n\nS",
      "# [Why are Forge apps unavailable for Jira Premium/Enterprise SANDBOX installations? on 2024-07-18](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/why-are-forge-apps-unavailable-for-jira-premium-enterprise-sandbox-installations/81925)\nWhy are Forge apps unavailable for Jira Premium/Enterprise SANDBOX installations? Doesn’t this place Forge apps at a competitive disadvantage to Connect apps in the Atlassian Marketplace?\n\n(I’m asking this question as both a customer and an app developer.)\n\nJira Premium/Enterprise has a sandbox feature. A feature of sandboxes is that you can add apps for free if those apps are paid-for in your production site. (i.e. You only need to pay for an app once between sandbox and production.)\n\nAtlassian Marketplace apps with a paid subscription on a linked production environment can be added to a sandbox for free.\n\nHowever, I discovered that some of my paid productions apps cannot be added to my sandbox for free. Instead, the Atlassian Marketplace wants me to pay for a second app subscription.\n\nHere’s what is supposed to be displayed when adding an already-subscribed app to a sandbox:\n\nNotice the button says “Add to sandbox” and the caption indicates the app is already purchased.\n\nAnd this is the information bubble:\n\nBut for some apps that are already purchased, you see the normal trial/subscription feature:\n\nExpecting it to be a Marketplace bug, I submitted a support ticket. This was the response:\n\n[App name] is a forge app which means that Atlassian does not provide free apps for the “forge” category of apps.\n\n.\n\nForge is a platform for building Atlassian Jira/Confluence apps just like connect : About Forge\n\n.\n\nIn this case, you can reach out to the app vendor and ask them for approval to extend the app on the sandbox.\n\n.\n\nOnce you have this approval please provide me with a screenshot of it and I would be happy to extend the evaluation of the app for you.\n\nFrom a customer perspective, this feels bad for a few reasons:\n\nIt’s confusing: As a customer, how do I know which apps are Forge apps and which are Connect apps? (And how many customers even aware of Forge vs. Connect?)\n\nIt’s inconvenient: It either costs me more money, or I have to contact individual app vendors and either get a promo code for my sandbox or send approval to Atlassian support.\n\nIt violates the advertised functionality for Premium sandboxes.\n\nFrom a developer perspective, it’s even worse (IMO): Atlassian is strongly encouraging us to adopt Forge, but it seems that doing so could put us at a competitive disadvantage, right?\n\nJira Premium/Enterprise users will be motivated to select a Connect app over a Forge app if they’re using the sandbox feature. I realize that sandboxes typically have fewer users than prod sites, so the extra sandbox subscription should be less than the prod subscription. But still, I would expect most people to opt for a free sandbox installation (Connect) than a paid sandbox installation (Forge). (Obviously, this is assuming the Forge app doesn’t have enough of a differentiation to outweigh the sandbox fees.)\n\nI guess this is a question that turned into a rant. So back to the question…why is it this way? Am I wrong about the competitive disadvantage? Or is it actually a bug and not expected as Atlassian Support claimed?\n\nThanks!",
      "# [Loading... on 2018-01-27](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CLOUD-6999)\nHi everyone,\n\nMy name is Moinak Chatterjee and I’m a Senior Group Product Manager at Atlassian. We have a few important updates on custom domains.\n\nCustom domains for Jira and Confluence\n\nCustom domains are now generally available for Jira and will become generally available for Confluence starting in Q3. Custom domains for both Jira and Confluence will be available on Premium and Enterprise cloud plans. The rollout for Jira started today and will continue gradually over the next two weeks.\n\nCustom domains are an administrative capability that allow organizations to use their own domain name to host Atlassian products. For example, using go.jira.acme.com instead of acme.atlassian.net. Using a customer-branded URL instead of an Atlassian-branded URL helps make sites more discoverable, accessible, and uniquely yours, since they’re based on the organization’s domain rather than Atlassian’s. Custom domains join the family of advanced administrative capabilities that are the foundations of our Premium offering and are also included in Enterprise plans, alongside features like sandbox and release tracks.\n\nCustom domains for Jira Service Management help centers\n\nFor Jira Service Management (JSM) help centers, discoverability and branding are of the utmost importance so that your customers can get the help they need as quickly as possible. Custom domains for JSM help centers enable better customer service rather than better administration, which is why they will continue to be available on all paid cloud plans.\n\nGetting started with custom domains\n\nIf you’re ready to get started with custom domains for Jira, follow these instructions. We will provide an update on this post when custom domains for Confluence become generally available.\n\nIf you are not already using a Premium license(s), you will need to upgrade to Cloud Premium to enable custom domains for Jira or Confluence. If you’re also looking for advanced scale, security & compliance, analytics, and support, we recommend you evaluate the Cloud Enterprise plan.\n\nURL redirects for even more flexibility\n\nWe’ve heard your feedback and understand that many of you are looking for more flexibility in how you configure custom domains, which is why we also support URL redirects.\n\nIn designing the custom domains solution, we’ve been intentional about balancing security, customization, and open collaboration. Having a two-level domain plays a critical role in making our solution resilient to potential man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. At this point, we do not have plans to revisit the two-level subdomain construct, but customers who would like to use a shorter URL can set up a URL redirect. If you choose to use a redirect, you can create links with a shorter, fully customized base URL that redirects your users to the full URL.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nCustom domains for Jira and Jira Service Management are generally available today. Custom domains for Confluence will become generally available in Q3. Therefore, we will close this ticket 30 days after Confluence custom domains become generally available. This will give you time to use this ticket to ask questions about how to use and access custom domains. After that time, we ask that you raise a support ticket with any questions.\n\nWe know many of you have given feedback about custom domains in the past. If you have additional feedback, we welcome you to share your candid feedback and concerns. We’ll be listening! But as a way to keep the dialogue productive, please note that we will prioritize addressing comments related to the functionality of custom domains and how to use them.\n\nBest,\n\nMoinak Chatterjee\n\nSenior Group Product Manager, Atlassian\n\nCustom Domains for Jira - Early Access Program\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the launch of our highly anticipated feature - Custom Domains for Jira! We are inviting you to join our Early Access Program (EAP) and be among the first to explore and provide feedback on this new feature.\n\nCustom Domains is designed to give you more control over your Jira instance and enhance your branding. This new feature allows you to customize your Jira domain to match your company’s domain, making it easier for your team members to remember and recognize.\n\nTo join the EAP, follow these steps:\n\nExpress your interest on our EAP signup page - Registration link\n\nFill out the form with your details.\n\nAwait your confirmation email with further instructions.\n\nPlease note that the Early Access Program for the Custom Domains feature is limited to a select group of users for now. We encourage you to sign up as soon as possible to secure your spot. We will further communicate regarding the status of your request post mid-January after analysing your response.\n\nOnce you're part of the EAP, we ask that you use the Custom Domains feature and provide us with feedback. We appreciate any insights you can provide about your experience, whether they're about usability, performance, or any other aspect of the feature.\n\nWe are committed to making the Custom Domains feature the best it can be, and we are eager to receive your valuable input. We believe that with your help, we can create a more personalized and effective Jira experience for all our users.\n\nIf you have any questions about the EAP or the new Custom Domains feature, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us at Custom Domains Support\n\nBest Regards,\n\nPrashanth M\n\nProduct Manager, Jira Platform\n\nHi everyone,\n\nCustom domains for Jira Service Management Help Center paid customers have exited beta and generally available! We also have progress to report on work to introduce more flexibility in your custom domains and on a new early access program for custom domains for Jira products.\n\nValue of custom domains for your JSM Help Center\n\nImplementing your own branded URL for your Help Center will make it easier for your customers to find and recognize your brand. Operationally, your customers will have an even more seamless experience getting the help they need from the right places. Greater discoverability enables more self-provisioned help and less time required for your team to manage requests.\n\nIntroducing more flexibility in first level subdomains\n\nSince announcing the open beta for this feature in August, we’ve been working to introduce more flexibility in how you implement your branded URL. Currently, you’re prompted to select from a list of keywords for your first level subdomain, but that part of the domain will soon also be free text. Once first level subdomain flexibility is shipped, it will be available across all future custom domain launches for your various Atlassian products.\n\nEarly access - custom domains for Jira\n\nLast week, we announced the launch of the Early Access Program (EAP) for custom domains for Jira - including Jira Software, Jira Work Management, Jira Product Discovery and the agent experience in Jira Service Management. If you’re interested in joining the program, please refer to this comment and complete this registration form.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nAs we mentioned in August, we’re releasing custom domains support on a per-product basis. Please visit the Atlassian Cloud Roadmap to follow along on progress. We will introduce the per-product leaders in a future update.\n\nBest, Luke\n\nHi everyone,\n\nAs of August 1, 2023, we have released custom domains into open beta for all paid Jira Service Management Help Center customers. With this release comes greater discoverability, customization, and ease of use for your organizations' admins, teams, and customers. For details on the release, please see the Jira Service Management community article.\n\nWhere we are now\n\nWith our open beta underway, we’re happy to share that we are seeing broad-based adoption across our customer base and a high completion rate across customers who begin to setup up custom domains for their organization. Please continue to use the \"Give feedback\" option inside Admin Hub, or email custom-domains-working-group@atlassian.com[|mailto:custom-domains-feedback@atlassian.com], or leave a comment here. We continue to monitor the open beta results and your feedback to inform our approach for what's next.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nOur approach is to release custom domains support on a per-product basis for Jira Software, the Agent Experience in Jira Service Management, and Confluence.\n\nAs a reminder, the timeline for when we release support for each product will vary. You can visit our cloud roadmap or continue to watch this ticket for additional progress updates.\n\nThank you for your continued engagement. We will post another update in the coming months.\n\nBest, Luke\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI am bringing you the latest update on the Custom Domains work. The leaves may be changing around the Atlassian San Francisco office, but I’m happy to report our custom domains work is still green (and on track!) for early access in 2023.\n\nShipping custom domains requires extensive to changes to both our products and numerous pieces of our underlying shared cloud infrastructure. Among product teams, the Jira Service Management team is currently farthest along on this journey. As such, I’m excited to announce they have recently completed detailed, technical scoping and are beginning the implementation to bring Custom Domains to JSM.\n\nIn our last update, we mentioned that the approach to Custom Domains requires the enablement of new security measures. As many of you know, we operate under a multi-tenant SaaS architecture, which allows for better scalability and efficiency, minimizes security risks, among other benefits. This architectural approach also allows a single Atlassian account to be granted access to data across any number of Atlassian organizations, products, and marketplace apps. With the introduction of Custom Domains, we plan to add guardrails for the new third-party traffic controls (e.g. DNS resolver, Certificate Authority, etc.) between the user and the Atlassian systems.\n\nAs a result, we are focusing on added security measures around auth tokens, improved security threat detection, and increased user awareness when they encounter a custom domain. We are also building out corresponding admin controls for managing custom domains in Admin hub.\n\nWhile we are committed to bringing Custom Domains to you as quickly as possible, we must do so with security and the safety of your data in mind. On behalf of the various teams contributing to this feature, thank you for your patience and continued support. Stay tuned for the next update next quarter.\n\nBest regards,\n\nLuke Liu\n\nSenior Product Manager, Admin Experience\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI work with dmeyer and lead Atlassian’s custom domains team and will take over updates on our progress going forward. I know many of you have been eagerly awaiting one!\n\nIn the last 6 months, the team has reviewed our previous technical efforts on custom domains implementation, alongside general security improvements implemented by major web browsers, and we’ve achieved internal consensus on the new approach to deliver this feature for our Jira and Confluence cloud products.\n\nI apologize that this update has not come sooner, but we have been quite busy taking our recommendation through internal security and architectural reviews, and I am happy to report that we are well on our way to fleshing out the execution plan. We will ramp up on execution over the new several months and continue to plan for an EAP for custom domains next year.\n\nSecurity for our customers remains our highest priority and a place where we are unwilling to compromise. While we understand and have deep sympathy for the urgency of delivering custom domains, our focus in the last six months has been finding a more feasible implementation that meets customer requirements, without putting our customers at risk.\n\nI also appreciate that many of you are puzzled by why something that appears so trivial at first glance would be so hard to deliver in practice. We are committed to helping our customers understand the unique complexity of getting a solution out there quickly and safely and are working on a blog post that will unpack some of the underlying technical challenges and constraints we’ve had to overcome.\n\nAcross Atlassian, we are committed to investing where we can have the greatest impact for the most customers possible. I encourage you to check out the full scope of our plans on our public roadmap, custom domains included.\n\nOn behalf of the Atlassian team, we take your feedback seriously and understand both the frustration and the urgency. We are working hard to create the best overall experience for as many customers as possible, in line with our company values. You can share your feedback with me directly: ibagrak@atlassian.com\n\nWe plan to provide the next update on this feature by January 2022.\n\nBest regards,\n\nIlya Bagrak\n\nPrincipal Product Manager",
      "# [Atlassian Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1220355/announcement-feeds-smart-banners)\nWe’re experiencing an outage\n\nOur team is already on it. We’re investigating the issue. Please find more information from the status page",
      "# [Atlassian announces end of support for Opsgenie](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43283178)\nThe most bizarre OpsGenie story was how in 2022, this tool was down for 2 weeks for hundreds of unlucky companies that were Atlassian customers. This was at a time when JIRA had an outage impacting a small percentage of their customer base - but still in the hundreds of organizations (with around tens of thousands of users.)\n\nWhile most companies can operate for some time without JIRA: losing your paging service means you're flying in the dark. And yet, Atlassian did not prioritize restoring OpsGenie.\n\nI covered the details at the time [1]. To this date, this incident is a real head-scratcher and makes me wonder if Atlassian has internalized how much more critical an incident alerting software is, compared to a ticketing software (JIRA) or wiki (Confluent).\n\n[1] https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/52148641/what-atl...\n\n[Promotional warning]\n\nDamn. As a founder in the incident management space (Rootly) I've had a lot of respect for Opsgenie. They had unique features like heartbeats and ran a lean but mighty team before selling to Atlassian. We saw them the most in Europe by far.\n\nOkay here comes to promotional part (don't hate me). If anyone is looking for a modern alternative to Opsgenie that isn't as expensive as PagerDuty, Rootly is worth checking out (Slack-native, holiday scheduling, request coverage, clean mobile app, etc).\n\nPrevious to Rootly I worked at Instacart where I helped us transition from PD to Opsgenie. Afterwards, still not being happy I built Rootly.\n\nToday, we've helped Trivago, Motive, Yahoo, and quite a few others make the switch. Pretty easy with our importer tool, etc.\n\nSeconding this and offering an honest testimonial as a huge fan of JJ and Rootly’s team.\n\nI championed and led the introduction of Rootly’s incident management product at two tech companies and counting. Rootly scales well - the Slack bot replaced chains of comms we used to have humans to handle. It’s reliable. And the attention to detail in their product feels like a love letter to SRE.\n\nRootly has the product chops to make a top notch incident management product. The domain modeling they’ve done for Rootly Oncall is solid - it feels like a superset of PagerDuty and Opsgenie.\n\nAnyone moving off Opsgenie would benefit from a close look at it.\n\nhttps://rootly.com/landing/pagerduty-vs-rootly-on-call\n\nNot trying to dunk on my competition but that is one thing that always surprised me too. Speed to deliver/innovate. I see large corporations all the time like even Slack (Agent marketplace), AWS (Bedrock), deliver at a high clip. PD truly had the opportunity to be a Datadog sized company given the brand name. Now it's a reputation impossible to shake.\n\nThere are some pretty low hanging fruit stuff that would make the PD experience palatable (e.g. ability to page teams not just services, allow for partial overrides). These things for us were <1 week projects.\n\nI do think PD is trying to rectify it by acquiring Jeli, giving it away for free in their new pricing plan, etc. Def feeling the squeeze a bit if I had to guess.\n\nPM from PD, chiming in here. tl;dr: we hear you and understand some of the challenges raised by that comparison sheet and frankly, we appreciate that folks like Rootly have challenged us to innovate in our core product more. And yeah, we're also pretty psyched to have the Jeli crew onboard, we think they're pretty smart, too. : ) As JJ calls out below, we've revamped our pricing plans to bring more incident management to all of our plans and spent a lot of time rethinking our chat experiences! (Again kudos to the Jeli crew!)\n\nTo not give too much of our roadmap away in a public forum, some of the basic components of overrides, paging groups and the web UI - keep your eyes peeled this year, one of our big focus areas is looking at how not only do we eliminate some of these gaps around on-call management and UI, but also going beyond just filling these table stakes. As you might imagine, PagerDuty scaled pretty aggressively (while also keeping our high reliability standards in place - customer trust is our #1 priority, after all we need to be up when everyone else is down), and we've had to make some investments to unlock our roadmap for this upcoming year.\n\nReal talk though, happy to continue the conversation/ meet up over a zoom. Send me an email: dgodbout[@]pagerduty.com. There are humans over here at PagerDuty who care a lot about folks like yourself and I consider myself lucky to get build products for people who are responsible for ensuring things just \"work\".\n\nEDIT:::: The title submitted (End of support) is a bit misleading. It's set to April 2027. I've left my original message here for brevity. Not all of it is valid, but some is.\n\nSuper bizarre. We're a large Opsgenie customer. The Opsgenie website or mobile apps never showed any notice, not even as of now. The \"Announcements\" section in the mobile and web apps as I'm writing reads a feature announcement: \"Coming soon: Simplified integration setup experience!\"\n\nOur customer relationship nor billing teams never received any communication.\n\nAtlassian — we don't mind you sunsetting any product, that's fine. But honestly, your paying customers shouldn't get to know this from a blog post in social media, especially for an On-call emergency product.\n\nI wouldn't trust any product from Atlassian after this fiasco.\n\nThis really sucks, that is rough. When you’re buying from a company like Atlassian you don’t expect this to happen really.\n\nThe writing has been on the wall for a while with Opsgenie though. I work at incident.io and loads of our customers have had deprecation/migration warnings for a year or so now, pushing them away from Opsgenie and into different Atlassian products (with no migration plan, sadly).\n\nIt’s been great for us as they tend to move to us (we have good migration support for Opsgenie) but confusing to watch from the outside as Atlassian never stopped selling the product even while actively shutting accounts down.\n\nWe aren’t subscribed to OpsGenie but Jira sends OpsGenie notifications all the time and it’s impossible to unsubscribe, because you need to cancel OpsGenie which we don’t have.\n\nAnyway the product map of Atlassian is unreadable now (Jira Work ≠ Jira Portfolio ≠ Jira Software ≠ Jira Service Management, all in Jira), and they don’t make clear what you’re subscribed to in the administration: Products, addons, same products but other sites, etc. This mess is downright visible in the announcement:\n\n> Starting today, there are two options for Opsgenie customers: move to Jira Service Management for robust end-to-end incident management, or move to Compass for alerting and on-call management alongside an intuitive software component catalog.\n\nI think they botched the project where they unified the login, and failed to make a centralized dashboard. In any case, I always wonder whether that’s intentional or a dedicated effort to make people spend more.\n\nPerhaps I'm in the minority, but I was immediately put off when I saw \"AI-native\" on that page.\n\nI don't want my incident management system to be AI anything. But then I thought maybe I'm being unreasonable so I checked out https://betterstack.com/docs/uptime/incident-silencing/ which was the first thing I found that was AI related.\n\nFrankly, the thought of some black box AI system deciding when to silence incidents utterly terrifies me. I want to be absolutely 100% certain that I'm receiving all my alerts. If they're too noisy or repetitive, it's on me and my team to improve the alert quality, not leave it to \"AI\" to figure out what to silence.\n\nThis Opsgenie announcement has certainly sparked some interesting discussions. Reading through the HN thread, it's fascinating to see how many teams are in similar situations - either just migrated to Opsgenie (ouch!) or trying to figure out what their next move should be.\n\nThe confusion around what's actually happening is understandable. While services will continue until 2027, end-of-sale in 2025 means many teams are already evaluating alternatives rather than waiting for the last minute.\n\nSomething that really resonated with me from gregdoesit's comment was that reminder of the 2022 outage where OpsGenie was down for two weeks for some customers. That incident highlighted something we think about constantly at Zenduty: paging services are mission-critical infrastructure.\n\nWhen your alerting system goes down, you're essentially flying blind. I've been working with teams dealing with exactly these transitions, and the migration challenges are real - it's never just \"update a webhook URL\" as someone mentioned. Your alert routing rules, escalation policies, on-call schedules, and integrations are complex systems that need careful migration.\n\nWhat I'm curious about: for those of you considering alternatives, what features matter most to you? Is it reliability? Pricing? Integration flexibility? The ability to reduce alert fatigue? Feel free to drop your thoughts here or DM me. Always happy to chat about these challenges even if you're not looking at Zenduty specifically. These transitions are stressful, and having been through them myself, I know how disruptive they can be to engineering teams who just want to focus on building their products.\n\nHere's a detailed comparison of all the opsgenie features and what you need to know before you decide to migrate to a different tool - http://zenduty.com/zenduty-the-best-opsgenie-alternative-com...\n\nObviously, reliability and pricing play a big role.\n\nAnother one that's surprisingly important to my employer: select the country of origin of phone calls.\n\nThe company I work for offers (among other things) datacenter colocation in Germany, and one of the selling points to compete against AWS is German ownership, no foreign control. Yes, some of our customers are very conservative. A few of our customers get direct notifications from our alerting tool, and if those phone calls arrive from a US-based number, it leaves a really bad impression.\n\nOpsGenie has instances hosted in EU for that.\n\nAtlassian is nothing if not consistently mediocre at integrating their purchased properties into each other.\n\nAnd they still haven’t finished making deployments have feature parity with builds in Bamboo.\n\nI made it partway through the interview process at a startup a couple weeks ago and realized I didn’t have a good answer if they asked my advice for what to use for project management, if not Atlassian. Which was fairly likely given the company maturity and the position. I’m still trying to find that answer.\n\nAside from GitHub I only have one other answer and it starts with, “this is going to sound crazy but hear me out.”\n\n>> Atlassian is nothing if not consistently mediocre at integrating their purchased properties into each other.\n\nI can't think of any company off the top of my head that has acquired a company and successfully integrated their tech stack into their own product offering. I work for a huge health care company whose stated goals are to grow through acquisition and in the 5 years I've been here, none of the painfully long process of integrating another companies tech has gone well - at all.\n\nIf anybody has any good examples of this happening, I would love to read about them.\n\nSomeone years ago “foisted” Trac on us. This is before CI/CD had reached the status of a default behavior.\n\nI thought it was going to be a shitshow but it turned out to hit the Pareto Front for project management, especially if you were doing Kanban. It’s one of the first tools that auto-linked between wiki, tickets, commits and commit messages. You could put ticket numbers and Wikiwords into your commit messages and it just worked.\n\nI’m trying to design a Trac but with CI now, but I’m working on a personal time management app instead, because I don’t build panipticons, so those features need to live where management cannot see.\n\nIt’s an alerting/incident response incumbents thing. Ask anyone how much PagerDuty/Opsgenie have improved in the last decade and you’ll have the answer!\n\nThere’s a first wave of incident startups that responded to the market having stagnated about 4 years ago (incident.io, FireHydrant, Rootly) then a slew of extremely recent (<1 year) companies leaning into AI incident response.\n\nIt’s weird that Opsgenie is just quitting that race but realistically they weren’t really competing in terms of pace of development. Felt more like Opsgenie was bought under the assumption IR was a ‘solved’ problem that Atlassian could just add to their stack and be done with it, while today it’s increasingly apparently that just paging someone is the smallest part.\n\nThis seems like the end of an era. While Pagerduty was always the most expensive, OpeGenie seemed like a good alternative for smaller teams.\n\nBut today's incident management needs to be a lot more than just paging.\n\nFor anyone looking to unlock a lot more value out of their incident management tool, may I suggest https://www.temperstack.com. A number of OpsGenie customers have already switched to Temperstack even before this announcement came out.\n\nI'm one of the cofounders of Temperstack and have personally helped companies make this transition. And I would be happy to get you set up as well. Feel free to drop me a line on amal@temperstack.com\n\nFounder of ilert.com here.\n\nFor months, we’ve heard from customers jumping ship to ilert, citing Opsgenie’s stagnation as Atlassian folded its features into Jira Service Management (JSM). JSM’s a beefy ITSM platform - great if you need the extras, overkill if you just want real-time incident response.\n\nNow there’s Compass: a dev-centric service catalog with basic alerting, on-call, and real-time notifications. Replacement or sidekick? Compass is a standalone Opsgenie successor for devs, yet it complements JSM’s broader IT support scope. Together, they tag-team the incident game, but neither fully mirrors Opsgenie’s features.\n\nilert’s the alternative: a German-built incident response tool covering alerting, on-call, status pages, and call routing—tightly focused.\n\nThoughts? Any existing customers following one of the migration paths suggested by Atlassian?",

      "# [Create and customize a company hub](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/create-and-customize-a-company-hub/)\nThis feature is only offered with Confluence Cloud Premium and Enterprise.\n\nWith Company Hub, you can create and customize a beautiful, dynamic company-wide information central within Confluence. This hub is where all employees can go for up-to-date announcements, news, key resources, and more.\n\nAn inviting and current company hub can help close communication gaps and promote productivity and collaboration by connecting teams, content, and resources in one central place.\n\nYou can craft a hub that looks and feels like your company’s go-to destination with ease by adding a custom name along with image carousels, visual cards, quick links, and more.\n\nSet up your hub\n\nProduct admins and anyone else with hub-specific edit permissions can start setting up their hub by selecting Company hub from the top left of the navigation.\n\nNote: Until your hub has been activated upon being published for the first time, only those with hub-specific edit permissions can see or access it.\n\nWhile this feature is currently limited to Confluence, it will be able to connect to plug-ins and access data from your other Atlassian products in order to provide its full functionality. For example, while it may only be turned on and available for use in your Confluence instance, it will be able to leverage information based on user permissions in linked Jira issues.\n\nName your hub\n\nTo get started, choose a unique name for your company hub.\n\nThis name will be visible to everyone from the navigation bar, and when visiting the hub itself. Ideally, your hub name should be distinct from your overall Confluence site name (which is what appears in your browser tab and your Confluence-related emails).\n\nYou can opt to change this name later on, or not name your hub at all.\n\nTip: Feel free to get creative and playful with your hub name. Hub names that are unique and memorable are more likely to attract an audience.\n\nCustomize your hub\n\nOnce you’ve named your hub, a helpful starter template will appear.\n\nYou can select Edit ( ) to customize this template, or start from scratch if desired, to make a hub that perfectly suits your company’s needs and preferences.\n\nHere are some ways you can take your hub to the next level:\n\n1. Add an eye-catching header image and emoji. For header images, we recommend high resolution images 1420 px or wider.\n\n2. Display dynamic content using cards, a spotlight, or a carousel. These premium features are ideal for showcasing information, or a collection of related items, in a visually appealing way.\n\n3. Select Customize navigation from the More actions ( ) menu and choose a custom logo and color scheme for the navigation bar.\n\nLooking for some inspiration on what to include in your hub?\n\nGive these ideas a try:\n\nEmployee kudos section\n\nTeam celebrations\n\nExecutive leadership update\n\nNew hire onboarding guide\n\nBenefits policy quick links\n\nManage hub permissions\n\nProduct admins have default edit permissions for the hub. They can add or remove other hub editors by selecting Hub permissions from the More actions ( ) menu.\n\nUpon selecting Hub permissions, you will encounter a configuration setup that looks and functions much like space permissions.\n\nTo add hub editors, select Edit ( ) then enter the name(s) of the hub editor(s) you’d like to add in the search bar, select the right name(s), and select Add. Once you’ve added everyone you need to, select Save.\n\nTo remove hub editors, select Edit ( ) then deselect the permissions for that user across the board. Select Save.\n\nHub-specific edit permissions can be granted to or removed at the user or group level.\n\nThose with hub-specific edit permissions can create, customize, activate (via Publish), and make updates to the hub. Only product admins can deactivate the hub, if needed, to make it no longer visible to the rest of the company (see below).\n\nActivate via publish\n\nWhen your hub is polished and ready to be seen by your entire company, it’s time to activate it by selecting Publish. Once you select Publish, everyone at your company will be able to access and view the hub from the top left of the navigation.\n\nNote: Only site and product admins can activate the hub by publishing it.\n\nAfter the initial hub activation, hub editors can make updates anytime by selecting the hub from the navigation and selecting Edit ( ). As you make changes, those changes are saved automatically on your end. Once you’re ready to broadcast your hub update to the entire company, select Update.\n\nDeactivate\n\nTo make it so that your hub is no longer visible to the entire company, you can select Deactivate hub from the More actions ( ) menu. Then, select Confirm.",

      "# [Atlassian Increasing DC prices…again. by Rodney N on 2025-01-15](https://thejiraguy.com/2025/01/15/atlassian-increasing-dc-prices-again/)\nHello there, Jira Guys and Gals. It’s been a minute – I’ve been dealing with some health stuff, and that’s limiting how much I can do. But again, you can still check me out on “The Jira Life” each week.\n\nSo, what’s so important that I’m back here – even though I’m not really up for it? Well, this morning Atlassian announced that they are going to be raising prices on DC. And even though I’m platform agnostic (use the best one for your situation), I find myself described as Data Center’s champion, so I figured I’d let you know. So, let’s dig into the what, when, and why of this thing.\n\nWhat?\n\nAtlassian announced this morning via email to customers that they will be raising prices in the new year. You can find a detailed breakdown of how much you will be paying after the increases go into effect on this page:\n\nData Center Pricing tables\n\nThese increases only impact Jira, JSM, and Confluence, which are arguably Atlassian’s largest three DC products. The increase varies per tier, but the average for all tiers is around 23%. No joking, I copied their charts into Excel and worked everything out!\n\nBut that is not all. On top of increasing the prices of existing tiers, Atlassian is also adding a number of new tiers at the top end of the scale. For example, on Jira Software DC, previously, if you had more than 50,000 users, you could buy an Unlimited license, meaning you no longer had a maximum. Now, the unlimited tier starts at 150,000+, with new tiers added for every 10K between 50K and 150K. Confluence has a new matching highest tier of 150K+, whereas JSM has a new max tier of 20K+ agents.\n\nNow, let’s be clear here. If you are an organization with 150K licensed users on a single instance, I would have considered federating onto multiple instances divided into logical business units a LONG time ago just to keep management of the instances somewhat sane. Trying to balance the needs of so many people when so many settings are still global and impact everyone will be challenging for any governance plan, no matter how well implemented. And there are other reasons I’d consider federating, which I’ll get into in a bit.\n\nWhen?\n\nThis is straight forward. These new prices go into effect for your first renewal on or after Feb. 15, 2025. If you want to lock in your 2024 pricing, I’d wait to renew for as close to Feb 14th as possible, and get that license for as long as possible. I fully understand that not everyone has that luxury, but it is the optimal strategy for getting the most savings.\n\nI’d also like to make a note of that date. Feb 15th is a rather auspicious day, as it’s fully one year after the Server EOL. I’m not saying that was intentional, or a secret message, I just find it odd to draw attention to that date in particular with this kind of news.\n\nAnother thing to note – depending on when you renew, some customers are getting as little as a month notice for this change. That’s precious little time to talk to upper management about these changes. If your budget is already locked in for the year, and THEN you get this news, well, that extra money has to come from somewhere. That is one reason I don’t like how Atlassian handles these things. It feels like a last minute thing each year for customers on what I’d argue aren’t trivial price increases. The current top-tier license for Jira Software is going up 36%, which sounds like a high but understandable number until you realize it’s USD 386,000. Even as expensive as housing is in the US, you can buy a home with that amount in most markets. In other words, 3-4 people’s jobs must be cut to make room for that increase. Not. Trivial.\n\nWhy?\n\nSo, again, I don’t work for Atlassian, so I can’t speak to the real why. Atlassian puts this in their FAQ, but then go on such a tangent that they never *really* answer. No, seriously, read for yourselves:\n\nFuture Data Center Pricing FAQ\n\nNow, again, I’m not Atlassian, I’m just a member of the community. That means anything I say for the rest of this section is my pure speculation. If I hear from Atlassian’s lawyers, I’ll know I’m getting close to the truth. You have been warned.\n\nMuch debate has been given within the Community about the fate of Data Center. My good friend and colleague Fun Man Andy loves to say DC is a “Dead man walking,” convinced the announcement for its EOL is always after the next conference. I disagree with him.\n\nAtlassian has made no secret that they have large customers who they know will absolutely never be able to go to Atlassian Cloud. If it’s the customers I’m thinking about, they are not wrong. But if it’s the customers I’m thinking about, they also have very deep pockets. So I don’t think they’ll end support for DC. They’ll stop making new features, yes, and we’ve all seen that. (Anyone else remember the DC “Feature Complete” speech from Team ’24?)\n\nNo, rather than EOL it, they’ll keep raising prices gradually until organizations on DC instances “self-select” to go to Cloud or another platform while keeping support for orgs with deeper pockets and less tolerance to move. It’s rather gruesome analogy is the “Boiling Frog” process. The idea is that if you put a frog into an already boiling pot of water, it will jump out immediately. But if you put it in a room temperature pot of water, then slowly raise the temperature, they won’t notice until it’s too late. Beyond being cruel, it’s also not true, but it’s my best analogy. I think this is just another step in raising the heat.\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nWell, the most obvious thing you can do is take a look at your users. I’ve long recommend you revoke licenses from users who haven’t used their access in 6 months or more. I’ve seen some people do it shorter, some longer (12 months, 6 months, 1 month, and 2 weeks are all popular thresholds for this approach). The key here is to see if you can get down to a lower tier. Will it work, I don’t know. Sometimes it does, and sometimes you’ve already mined that ore vein dry.\n\nAnother approach you might consider is, as I mentioned above, locking in the 2024 pricing as close to Feb 14th as possible. To be clear, this isn’t fixing the issue, it’s just putting it off until later.\n\nUltimately, though, not much can be done. You can lessen the pain, but these price increases just keep coming. Your best bet is just to keep your license count as low as possible, and hope you’re on a tier that gets a 15% increase rather than a 25% or 30% increase.\n\nI can’t even say going to Atlassian Cloud will shield you from increases, as they had their own round of them back in November. One thing I haven’t done in years though is to do a cost comparison to see what the difference is in pricing between Cloud and DC. Maybe I should do that here soon.\n\nFinal Thoughts",
