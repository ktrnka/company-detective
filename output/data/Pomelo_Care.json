The company specializes in virtual maternity and neonatal care services, aiming to improve maternal and infant health outcomes through a combination of virtual and in-person care. Pomelo Care partners with health plans and employers to offer comprehensive support for pregnancy and newborn care, complementing traditional in-person OB-GYN or midwife care [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pomelo-care).\n\nPomelo Care's services include a Virtual Maternity Care Program, which provides personalized support throughout the fertility, pregnancy, and postpartum journey. The program offers patients unlimited access to a dedicated care team, including doctors, midwives, nurses, dietitians, and therapists. The company also provides care coordination services, collaborating with in-person healthcare providers to ensure comprehensive care [(Pomelo Care, 2024)](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/pomelo-care-raises-46-million-and-publishes-data-proving-its-virtual-care-model-improves-outcomes).\n\nPomelo Care operates on a B2B model, serving employers and health plans. The company has grown significantly, covering over 3 million lives across 46 states as of June 2024. Pomelo Care's services are often available at no cost to members through select employers and health plans [(Pomelo Care, 2024)](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/pomelo-care-raises-46-million-and-publishes-data-proving-its-virtual-care-model-improves-outcomes).\n\nThe company has raised a total of $86 million in funding, with the most recent Series B round securing $46 million in June 2024. This funding is intended to expand partnerships with payors and address the root causes of the maternal health crisis [(Pomelo Care, 2024)](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/pomelo-care-raises-46-million-and-publishes-data-proving-its-virtual-care-model-improves-outcomes).\n\nPomelo Care has been recognized for its innovative approach to maternal and neonatal healthcare, being named one of Fierce Healthcare's \"Fierce 15\" companies for 2024 [(Pomelo Care, 2024)](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/pomelo-care-raises-46-million-and-publishes-data-proving-its-virtual-care-model-improves-outcomes).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nMarta Bralic Kerns is the founder and CEO of Pomelo Care. She has articulated a clear vision for the company, emphasizing the importance of addressing the maternal health crisis in the U.S. Her leadership is supported by a team that includes Vineeta Agarwala, MD, PhD, from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), who brings valuable expertise in strategic partnerships and investor relations [(Pomelo Care, 2024)](https://leadiq.com/c/pomelo-care/627008cd1c78b3366676e812).\n\n# News\n\n## Funding and Financial Growth\n\nPomelo Care has experienced significant financial growth, securing $46 million in Series B financing on June 20, 2024. This round was led by existing investors First Round Capital and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). The funding will be used to accelerate partnerships with payors and expand the company's reach [(Pomelo Care, 2024)](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/pomelo-care-raises-46-million-and-publishes-data-proving-its-virtual-care-model-improves-outcomes).\n\n## Acquisition of The Doula Network\n\nIn September 2024, Pomelo Care acquired The Doula Network, the largest network of credentialed doulas in the United States. This strategic acquisition allows Pomelo to offer a hybrid model of care that combines virtual and in-person services, significantly expanding access to high-quality maternity care [(Anastassia Gliadkovskaya, 2024)](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/digital-health/pomelo-care-acquires-doula-network-expand-hybrid-maternity-care-model).\n\n## Clinical Outcomes and Research\n\nPomelo Care has published peer-reviewed data demonstrating the effectiveness of its care model. At the 2024 ACOG Clinical & Scientific Meeting, the company presented findings showing that its telemedicine care significantly improved rates of evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis and mental health screenings among high-risk populations [(Pomelo Care, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pomelo-care-publishes-peer-reviewed-data-demonstrating-significant-impact-of-its-virtual-maternal-health-care-model-302328938.html).\n\n## Market Position and Competitors\n\nPomelo Care operates in a competitive landscape that includes companies like Maven Clinic and Babyscripts. The acquisition of The Doula Network positions Pomelo uniquely as the only maternity care model offering both virtual and in-person services at scale. Recent legislative changes mandating Medicaid reimbursement for doula services present a significant opportunity for Pomelo to expand its market share [(Marta Bralic Kerns, 2024)](https://femtechinsider.com/pomelo-care-acquires-the-doula-network/).\n\nIn conclusion, Pomelo Care is poised for significant growth in the maternal and neonatal healthcare sector, backed by substantial funding and strategic acquisitions. The company's innovative approach to combining virtual and in-person care, along with its commitment to improving clinical outcomes, positions it as a leader in addressing the maternal health crisis in the United States.",

(“Pomelo Care”), operates as a covered entity, and provides the requested medical services. Among other things, Pomelo Providers contracts with Pomelo Care to license Pomelo Care’s web application to provide Pomelo Providers with the capability to receive, respond to and schedule requested professional services. Pomelo Care does not provide any professional services. All of the entities will share protected health information of patients as necessary to carry out treatment, payment, and health care operations as permitted by law. Use or disclosure pursuant to this Notice may include electronic transmittal or disclosure of your protected health information. For purposes of this Notice, any references to “you” or “your” also include your child or other family member to the extent that your child or other family member is being treated or receiving services from Pomelo Providers.\n\n‍\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (“HIPAA”) requires us to ask each of our patients to acknowledge receipt of this Notice. The Notice is published on the Pomelo Care website and the Pomelo Care mobile application.

We are required to abide by the terms of this Notice for as long as it remains in effect. We reserve the right to change the terms of this Notice as necessary and to make a new Notice effective for all protected health information maintained by Pomelo Providers.

Doctors, nurses and other health care professionals involved in your care will use information in your medical record and information that you provide about your symptoms and reactions to your course of treatment that may include procedures, medications, tests, medical history, etc. We may participate in health information exchanges (“HIEs”) and may electronically share your medical information for treatment, payment and healthcare operations purposes with other participants in the HIEs. HIEs allow us, and your other healthcare providers and organizations, to efficiently share and better use information necessary for your treatment and other lawful purposes. For instance, in some states, the inclusion of your medical information in an HIE is voluntary and subject to your right to opt-in or opt-out; if you choose to opt-in or not to opt-out, we may provide your medical information in accordance with applicable law to the HIEs in which we participate.\n\n‍\n\nUses and Disclosures for Payment: We may make uses and disclosures of your protected health information as necessary for payment purposes.

Dispute Resolution.\n\nAGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE\n\nYou agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services (each, a “Dispute”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party to any such Dispute retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”). By accepting these Terms and using our Services, You will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived Your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in New York, New York, and You hereby waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. You acknowledge and agree that You are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless You otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any limitations set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate on the right to arbitrate claims on a class or representative basis, or as part of a consolidated proceeding, as to a given claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and brought in the state or federal courts located in New York, New York. All other claims will be arbitrated. This Section 11 (Dispute Resolution) will survive any termination of these Terms.\n\nARBITRATION RULES\n\nThe arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this Section (the AAA Rules are available at https://www.adr.org/Rules or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.\n\nARBITRATION PROCESS\n\nA party to a Dispute who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.\n\nARBITRATION LOCATION AND PROCEDURE\n\nUnless You agree with us otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the city of New York, New York. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that are submitted to the arbitrator unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties to the Dispute, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.\n\nARBITRATOR’S DECISION\n\nThe arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of Section 9 (Limitation of Liability) above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses only to the extent required by applicable law.\n\nFEES\n\nThe responsibility of each party to the Dispute to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.\n\n12.

      "# [Terms & Policies](https://www.pomelocare.com/terms-policies)\nNotice of Privacy Practices (NPP)\n\nEffective December 21, 2024\n\nLast Updated: December 21, 2024\n\nNOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES\n\nTHIS NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES (“NOTICE”) DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU OR YOUR CHILD OR OTHER FAMILY MEMBER MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN OBTAIN ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.\n\n‍\n\nSpecifically, this Notice describes the privacy practices of Pomelo, P.C., Pomelo CA, P.C., Pomelo KS, P.A., and Pomelo NJ, P.C. (collectively, “Pomelo Providers,” “We” or “Us”), the independent professional medical entity that contracts with Pomelo Care, Inc. (“Pomelo Care”), operates as a covered entity, and provides the requested medical services. Among other things, Pomelo Providers contracts with Pomelo Care to license Pomelo Care’s web application to provide Pomelo Providers with the capability to receive, respond to and schedule requested professional services. Pomelo Care does not provide any professional services. All of the entities will share protected health information of patients as necessary to carry out treatment, payment, and health care operations as permitted by law. Use or disclosure pursuant to this Notice may include electronic transmittal or disclosure of your protected health information. For purposes of this Notice, any references to “you” or “your” also include your child or other family member to the extent that your child or other family member is being treated or receiving services from Pomelo Providers.\n\n‍\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (“HIPAA”) requires us to ask each of our patients to acknowledge receipt of this Notice. The Notice is published on the Pomelo Care website and the Pomelo Care mobile application. You acknowledge receipt of the Notice by clicking on the applicable acknowledgement button, or by indicating your acknowledgement in another written or digital manner provided.\n\n‍\n\nWe are required by HIPAA and certain state laws to maintain the privacy of our patients’ protected health information, to provide patients with notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to protected health information, and to notify you in the event of a breach of your unsecured protected health information. We are required to abide by the terms of this Notice for as long as it remains in effect. We reserve the right to change the terms of this Notice as necessary and to make a new Notice effective for all protected health information maintained by Pomelo Providers. Should we make a change, you may obtain a revised copy from the location providing treatment. A copy of any revised Notice of Privacy Practices may be obtained by mailing a request to Pomelo, P.C., 4701 Sangamore Road, Suite 100-N, Bethesda, MD 20816 or by email to privacy-inquiries@pomelocare.com.\n\nUSES AND DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION\n\nUses and Disclosures That May Be Made Without Your Consent\n\nUses and Disclosures for Treatment: We may make use and disclosures of your protected health information as necessary for your treatment. Doctors, nurses and other health care professionals involved in your care will use information in your medical record and information that you provide about your symptoms and reactions to your course of treatment that may include procedures, medications, tests, medical history, etc. We may participate in health information exchanges (“HIEs”) and may electronically share your medical information for treatment, payment and healthcare operations purposes with other participants in the HIEs. HIEs allow us, and your other healthcare providers and organizations, to efficiently share and better use information necessary for your treatment and other lawful purposes. For instance, in some states, the inclusion of your medical information in an HIE is voluntary and subject to your right to opt-in or opt-out; if you choose to opt-in or not to opt-out, we may provide your medical information in accordance with applicable law to the HIEs in which we participate.\n\n‍\n\nUses and Disclosures for Payment: We may make uses and disclosures of your protected health information as necessary for payment purposes. For instance, during the normal course of business operations, we may forward information regarding your medical procedures and treatment to your insurance company to arrange payment for the services provided to you. We may use your information to prepare a bill to send to you or to the person responsible for your payment.\n\nUses and Disclosures for Health Care Operations: We may use and disclose your protected health information as necessary, and as permitted by law, for our health care operations, which may include clinical improvement, professional peer review, business management, accreditation and licensing, etc. For instance, we may use and disclose your protected health information for purposes of improving clinical treatment and patient care practices.\n\n‍\n\nBusiness Associates: Certain aspects and components of our services are performed through contracts with outside persons or organizations (including Pomelo Care) such as auditing, accreditation, outcomes data collection, legal services, etc. At times it may be necessary for us to provide your protected health information to one or more of these outside persons or organizations who assist us with our health care operations. In all cases, we require these business associates to appropriately safeguard the privacy of your information.\n\n‍\n\nOther Uses and Disclosures: We are permitted and/or required by law to make certain other uses and disclosures of your protected health information without your consent or authorization for the following: any purpose required by law; public health activities, such as required reporting of disease, injury, birth and death, or required public health investigations; to do research; if we suspect child abuse or neglect; if we believe you to be a victim of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence; to the Food and Drug Administration to report adverse events, product defects, or to participate in product recalls; to your employer when we have provided health care to you at the request of your employer; to a government oversight agency conducting audits, investigations, or civil or criminal proceedings; in response to a court or administrative ordered subpoena or discovery request; to law enforcement officials as required by law to report wounds and injuries and crimes; to coroners and/or funeral directors consistent with law; to respond to organ and tissue donation requests; if you are a member of the military we may also release your protected health information for national security or intelligence activities; and to workers’ compensation agencies for workers’ compensation benefit determination or as otherwise required under workers’ compensation laws.\n\n‍\n\nUses and Disclosures That May Be Made Without Your Authorization With the Opportunity to Object\n\nUnless you object, we may from time to time disclose your personal health information to designated family, friends, and others who are involved in your care or in the payment for your care in order to facilitate that person’s involvement in caring for you or paying for your care. If you are unavailable, incapacitated, or facing an emergency medical situation and we determine that a limited disclosure may be in your best interest, we may share limited personal health information with involved individuals without your approval. We may also disclose limited personal health information to a public or private entity that is authorized to assist in disaster relief efforts in order for that entity to locate a family member or other persons that may be involved in some aspect of caring for you.\n\n‍\n\nUses and Disclosures Based Upon Your Written Consent\n\nPsychotherapy Notes: We must obtain your written authorization for most uses and disclosures of psychotherapy notes.\n\n‍\n\nMarketing: We must obtain your written authorization to use and disclose your protected health information for most marketing purposes.\n\n‍\n\nSale of Protected Health Information: We must obtain your written authorization for any disclosure of your protected health information that constitutes a sale of protected health information.\n\n‍\n\nOther Uses: Other uses and disclosures of your protected health information, not described above, will be made only with your written authorization. You may revoke your authorization, at any time, in writing, except to the extent that we have already taken action in reliance on such prior authorization.\n\nRights You Have Regarding Your Personal Health Information\n\nYou may request to exercise any of the rights described below by contacting our Privacy Officer using the contact information at the end of this Notice.\n\nAccess to Your Personal Health Information\n\nYou have the right to a copy and/or inspect much of the protected health information that we retain on your behalf. All requests for access must be made in writing and signed by you or your legal representative and access is usually provided within 30 days of the request.

In some cases, you may have the right to ask for a review of our denial.\n\nAmendments to Your Personal Health Information\n\nYou have the right to request in writing that protected health information that we maintain about you be amended or corrected. We are not obligated to make all requested amendments but will give each request careful consideration.

If an amendment or correction request is made, we may notify others who work with us if we believe that such notification is necessary.\n\nReceive Confidential Communications From Us by Alternative Means or at Alternative Locations\n\nYou have the right to request that we communicate with you in a certain way or at a certain location.

We are not required to agree to your restriction request, but will attempt to accommodate reasonable requests when appropriate. However, we must agree not to disclose your protected health information to your health plan if the disclosure is for payment or health care operations and relates to a health care item or service which you paid for in full out of pocket. We retain the right to terminate an agreed-to restriction if we believe such termination is appropriate. In the event of a termination by us, we will notify you of such termination. You also have the right to terminate, in writing or orally, any agreed-to restriction by sending us such termination notice.\n\nPaper Copy\n\nYou have the right to obtain a paper copy of this notice from us.\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you have questions or need further assistance regarding this Notice, you may contact our Privacy Officer at Pomelo, P.C., 4701 Sangamore Road, Suite 100-N, Bethesda, MD 20816, or by email at privacy-inquiries@pomelocare.com.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nEffective: December 21, 2024\n\nLast Updated: December 21, 2024\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nPomelo Care, Inc., together with its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, \"Company\" \"us,\" \"we,\" or \"our\") is committed to protecting the privacy of Personal Data (i.e., information reasonably related to a specific individual).

Exclusive Remedy.\n\nIf you are dissatisfied with the Services, Your sole and exclusive remedy is to stop using the Services.\n\n11. Dispute Resolution.\n\nAGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE\n\nYou agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services (each, a “Dispute”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party to any such Dispute retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”). By accepting these Terms and using our Services, You will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived Your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in New York, New York, and You hereby waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. You acknowledge and agree that You are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless You otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any limitations set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate on the right to arbitrate claims on a class or representative basis, or as part of a consolidated proceeding, as to a given claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and brought in the state or federal courts located in New York, New York. All other claims will be arbitrated. This Section 11 (Dispute Resolution) will survive any termination of these Terms.\n\nARBITRATION RULES\n\nThe arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this Section (the AAA Rules are available at https://www.adr.org/Rules or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.\n\nARBITRATION PROCESS\n\nA party to a Dispute who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.\n\nARBITRATION LOCATION AND PROCEDURE\n\nUnless You agree with us otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the city of New York, New York. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that are submitted to the arbitrator unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties to the Dispute, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.\n\nARBITRATOR’S DECISION\n\nThe arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of Section 9 (Limitation of Liability) above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses only to the extent required by applicable law.\n\nFEES\n\nThe responsibility of each party to the Dispute to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.\n\n12.

We may freely assign our rights or obligations under these Terms without your consent.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback, suggestions, and other communications (collectively, “Feedback”) about the Services. You should know that We can, but are not obligated to, use Your Feedback without restriction or any obligation to compensate you, and we have no obligation to keep Your Feedback confidential.\n\nEven after termination, these Terms will remain in effect such that all terms that by their nature may survive termination will be deemed to survive such termination.\n\nIn order to protect the integrity of the Services, we may, at any time in our sole discretion, block users from certain IP addresses from accessing the Services.\n\nIf you have any questions about these Terms, please contact privacy-inquiries@pomelocare.com.\n\n‍\n\n14.

Company relies heavily on asynchronous work and avoids internal meetings, which can lead to highly active Slack threads during non-business hours. Management prioritizes rapid growth over sustainable operations, and clinicians and business staff alike are spread thin. \n\nIn Group / Out Group Dynamic: The majority of the leadership team all came from the same company, and will often spend the first few minutes of all-hands meetings reminiscing about nights out doing karaoke in NYC that the majority of the company was not present for. This can be isolating for new hires who do not have that shared history.\n\nShifting Goalposts: There is a lack of transparency from leadership around role definition, expectations, and success metrics. Employees who achieved or exceeded specific metrics outlined in their bonus plan still did not receive their full bonus. Management is quick to deploy performance plans in lieu of helping employees grow in their roles, which, when paired with an asynchronous, online-only work environment, can create a “sink or swim” culture.",

Company relies heavily on asynchronous work and avoids internal meetings, which can lead to highly active Slack threads during non-business hours. Management prioritizes rapid growth over sustainable operations, and clinicians and business staff alike are spread thin. \n\nIn Group / Out Group Dynamic: The majority of the leadership team all came from the same company, and will often spend the first few minutes of all-hands meetings reminiscing about nights out doing karaoke in NYC that the majority of the company was not present for. This can be isolating for new hires who do not have that shared history.\n\nShifting Goalposts: There is a lack of transparency from leadership around role definition, expectations, and success metrics. Employees who achieved or exceeded specific metrics outlined in their bonus plan still did not receive their full bonus. Management is quick to deploy performance plans in lieu of helping employees grow in their roles, which, when paired with an asynchronous, online-only work environment, can create a “sink or swim” culture.",

      "# [Pomelo Care by Pomelo Care](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/pomelo-care-raises-46-million-and-publishes-data-proving-its-virtual-care-model-improves-outcomes)\nNEW YORK, NY – June 20, 2024 – Pomelo Care, a virtual medical practice that improves maternal and newborn health outcomes, announced $46 million in Series B financing led by existing investors First Round Capital and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) Bio + Health. Pomelo will use this funding to accelerate its partnerships with payors across the country to address the root causes of the maternal health crisis.\n\n‍1 in 10 babies born in the US today start their life in a neonatal intensive care unit. US maternal morbidity and mortality rates are higher than peer countries, and the disparities in outcomes for people of color are unacceptable. Healthcare access continues to worsen, with 1 in 8 births occurring in U.S. counties with limited-to-no access to maternal care. Due to significant gaps in postpartum care, about half of pregnancy-related deaths in the U.S. occur after hospital discharge.\n\nThe evidence exists for how to identify people at highest risk for complications and which interventions are most effective, but existing data gaps and provider capacity challenges make it extremely difficult to apply these interventions at scale.\n\nPomelo has developed a care model that addresses these challenges by analyzing claims and health record data to proactively identify individual risk factors and providing virtual pregnancy, postpartum, and infant care to patients nationwide to reduce those risks, dramatically increasing access to high-quality, evidence-based care and improving outcomes.\n\n“It's rare to come across an opportunity where the incentives between patient, provider and payor are all aligned,” said Josh Kopelman, Partner at First Round Capital and Pomelo board member. “Marta and the Pomelo team have found an incredible opportunity to dramatically improve outcomes for the highest risk populations, while helping payors reduce their avoidable costs.”\n\nPomelo has achieved significant milestones this year including:\n\n$46 million in financing: The company today announced $46 million in Series B financing, bringing total funding to $79 million. The Series B was led by existing investors First Round Capital and a16z. Stripes joined this round along with additional participation from existing investors SV Angel, Operator Partners and BoxGroup. They join angels and healthcare industry leaders Adam Boehler, Founder and Managing Partner of Rubicon Founders, Former Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), and Founder of Landmark Health and Puneet Singh, CEO of CareBridge.\n\nCovering over 3 million lives: Since the beginning of 2024, Pomelo has grown its covered lives with health plan partners from 2 million to over 3 million, providing care to patients in 46 states.\n\nPublished peer-reviewed data proving improvement in clinical outcomes: Pomelo presented new research at the 2024 ACOG Clinical & Scientific Meeting showing that Pomelo’s telemedicine care dramatically scales critical interventions that reduce the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in a Medicaid population – hypertensive disorders like preeclampsia and mental health conditions. Pomelo’s care model increased rates of evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis by 2.4x, proven to reduce preeclampsia risk by 25%, and mental health screening rates by 7x, proven to reduce perinatal depression risk by 40%. This fall, Pomelo will present data at both the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Global Congress and the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference & Exhibition showing reductions in avoidable emergency room, inpatient, and NICU utilization as a result of Pomelo’s care.\n\n“We’ve long known what works to reduce maternal and infant complications. The questions have always been: can you identify the patients who are at highest risk, can you deeply engage them in care to drive uptake of the prevention strategies we know work, and can you do it in the highest risk populations with the most limited access to care?” said Marta Bralic Kerns, Founder & CEO of Pomelo Care. “This data demonstrates that we absolutely can. And with this additional funding, we’ll have the opportunity to scale our care model to more pregnant people across the country.”\n\n“Pomelo is one among a small set of health tech companies that have earned true scale,” shared Vineeta Agarwala, MD, PhD, General Partner at a16z Bio + Health and Pomelo board member. “This scale is evident in our partnerships with major Medicaid and commercial plans covering over 3 million lives, which create the opportunity to collaborate with OB providers, labor and delivery wards, and NICUs nationwide, while serving hundreds of thousands of expecting mothers and newborns with high quality, technology-enabled care.”\n\nAbout Pomelo Care\n\nPomelo Care is a virtual medical practice that addresses underlying risk factors to improve maternal and newborn health, increase access to care and reduce avoidable costs. The company supports its patients from preconception through an infant’s first year with personalized and proactive 24/7 care from a dedicated, multispecialty team. Pomelo works with leading commercial and Medicaid health plans and employers including Penn Medicine, Koch Industries and Elevance Health affiliated plans in Texas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Georgia. Pomelo Care is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, First Round Capital, Stripes, BoxGroup, Operator Partners, SV Angel and Allen & Company LLC.

      "# [Pomelo Care by Marta Bralic Kerns](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/a-new-model-for-maternity-care)\nThree years ago, I met a brilliant woman named Elizabeth Simmons, founder and CEO of The Doula Network, a national network of doulas providing physical, emotional, and educational support to people across the country. I had heard of her because our customers raved about The Doula Network and the outstanding community-based support they provided. Naturally, we had quite a lot to talk about.\n\nAs we chatted about Pomelo’s evidence-based, virtual care model, The Doula Network’s community-based, in-person approach, and the rapidly changing landscape around health plans and doula coverage, it was clear we had a unique opportunity in front of us.\n\nWhich brings us to today.\n\nI am incredibly proud to announce that Pomelo Care has acquired The Doula Network. We are merging our models to create a first for maternity care in the United States: a national hybrid virtual and in-person care model designed to significantly expand access to high-quality maternity care.\n\nThe Unique Impact of Doulas\n\nThere is a national maternity care emergency in the United States. The statistics are appalling: 1 in 10 babies born in the US today is admitted to a NICU, 1 in 8 births occur in counties with low or no access to maternal care, more than a third of counties are maternity care deserts, maternal morbidity rates are higher than peer countries and there are vast, unacceptable disparities in outcomes for women of color.\n\nSince 2021, Pomelo has provided medical care for women during preconception, pregnancy, birth, postpartum, and for both mother and infant during their infant’s first year. The Pomelo approach consists of virtual, round-the-clock care delivered by a dedicated team of obstetric and pediatric clinicians, midwives, nurses, dietitians, therapists, and lactation experts who ensure the patient and her baby have the best possible health outcomes.\n\nWith the addition of The Doula Network, patients may also now be partnered with a community-based doula who will provide consequential support to patients throughout their pregnancy and postpartum period. In addition to providing in-person support, the doulas will become active members of a patient’s virtual care team, and together they will address key medical, behavioral and social factors to improve outcomes for mom, baby, and family.\n\nBut why is doula care so important?\n\nThere is extensive research showing doula care improves maternity outcomes and health equity, particularly among Black mothers.\n\nCompared to high-risk pregnant patients who do not receive doula care, patients under doula care during labor and delivery are 2 times less likely to have a birth complication, 4 times less likely to have a low-birth-weight baby, 40% less likely to have a cesarean delivery, and experience lower rates of preterm birth.\n\nAccording to the March of Dimes, they also experience shorter time in labor, fewer negative childbirth experiences, less anxiety and depression, and are more likely to breastfeed. And importantly, they are more likely to feel happy about the care they received.\n\nThe Doula Network has shown meaningful improvements in key measures of maternal and infant health across their populations, with a 19% cesarean section rate reduction compared to the national average and a 36% low birthweight rate reduction compared to the national average.\n\nThe simple fact is: doulas improve outcomes, lower costs, and reduce disparities. Pomelo Care’s patients will benefit greatly from their addition to our team.\n\nRapidly Growing Demand\n\nWhile the impact of doulas is clear, only 6% of women in the United States currently have coverage for doula care. Historically, health plans have not covered doula services and it has remained largely a cash-pay industry, which can cost several hundred or even several thousand dollars for patients.\n\nDoula coverage has remained limited. According to the Washington Post, “For about six years starting in 2014, Minnesota and Oregon were the only states that mandated coverage of doula services through Medicaid.”\n\nBut recently, things began to change. Through the tireless work of maternal healthcare advocates and key lawmakers, 13 states plus Washington D.C. now require Medicaid reimbursement for doula services, and 30 more states are actively taking steps toward doula reimbursement.\n\nAs health plans are adapting to the new requirements and working to integrate doulas into their networks to meet growing demand, they have overwhelmingly chosen The Doula Network as their partner. Their reputation and results are unparalleled.\n\nAs the largest network of credentialed doulas in the United States, in-network with major commercial and Medicaid plans, The Doula Network has quickly emerged as the clear market leader.\n\nWith this new, integrated care model, Pomelo will significantly expand access to evidence-based maternity care across the United States, invest in the national doula ecosystem, and meet the growing commercial and Medicaid demand for community-based doulas.\n\nWe will also set a new standard for maternity care, where women have access to round-the-clock virtual medical care and the support they need by their side during one of the most exciting and challenging times in their lives.\n\nWe are now in the midst of seamlessly integrating The Doula Network into Pomelo Care and will soon begin offering in-person doula services to our patients.\n\nI am incredibly thankful to the entire Pomelo Care team for working to make this acquisition a reality. And especially grateful for the partnership of Elizabeth, who is joining Pomelo as Head of Doula Network, and The Doula Network team for joining us in our work to address the maternal healthcare crisis and bring high-quality care to every person who needs it.",
      "# [Pomelo Care by Marta Bralic Kerns](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/scaling-maternal-care-that-works)\nI started Pomelo because 1 in 10 babies born in the US today starts their life in a neonatal intensive care unit. Maternal morbidity and mortality rates are higher than our peer countries, and the disparities in outcomes for people of color are unacceptable. The evidence exists for how to identify people at highest risk and which interventions are most effective, but there just isn’t enough capacity in the healthcare system to apply these interventions at scale.\n\nWe are addressing these challenges head on by analyzing claims and health record data to identify individual risk factors, and providing virtual pregnancy, postpartum, and infant care to patients across the country to reduce those risks, dramatically increasing access and improving outcomes.\n\n‍Covering 3 million lives with health plan partners\n\nWe’re proud of the milestones we’ve achieved over the last year. Since just the beginning of 2024, we’ve grown from 2 million covered lives to over 3 million today and are serving patients in 46 states through our commercial and Medicaid health plan partners. And we’re expanding access to quality care for patients: one-third of our care occurs outside of traditional office hours, when patients have real and often urgent needs, but typically can’t access care outside of a hospital.\n\n‍Published data that shows our model is working\n\nMost importantly, we’ve proven the impact of our care on patients. The evidence is clear on what needs to be done to prevent the severe complications of preeclampsia and perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) – two of the leading drivers of maternal mortality and morbidity in the US. We know that a low dose aspirin regimen reduces preeclampsia risk by 25%, but fewer than 25% of high risk patients start taking aspirin and that too few patients are screened for PMADs and offered timely treatment.\n\nLast month, we presented new data at the ACOG Annual Clinical & Scientific Meeting showing that Pomelo’s telemedicine care dramatically improves both evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis rates (by 2.4x) and mental health screening rates (by 7x) in a Medicaid population.\n\nThis fall, we’ll present data at both the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Global Congress and the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference & Exhibition showing reductions in emergency room, inpatient, and NICU utilization as a result of Pomelo’s care.\n\nBehind these statistics are patients whose lives changed because they got the care they needed.\n\nLike Ava, who had preeclampsia during her first pregnancy and was now pregnant with her second baby, putting her at high risk of developing preeclampsia again. Our provider recommended that she start taking daily low-dose aspirin and spent time sharing the evidence and addressing concerns about taking medication during pregnancy. When Ava’s Pomelo nurse checked in a couple days later to see if she had started her daily aspirin regimen, Ava said she hadn't because she couldn't afford the out-of-pocket cost. Her care team quickly jumped into action to find a bottle of 100 low-dose aspirin for $4 at a local store. Ava started taking low-dose aspirin and stuck with it – significantly reducing her risk of developing preeclampsia. She avoided preeclampsia altogether and delivered at term, with no NICU stay.\n\nWe’ve long known what works to address the maternal health crisis. The critical questions have always been: can you identify the patients who are at highest risk, can you deeply engage them in care and drive uptake of the prevention strategies we know work, and can you do it in the highest risk populations with the most limited access to care?\n\nWith this data, we proved that we absolutely can.\n\n‍New funding to continue to increase access to evidence-based care\n\nToday, I’m thrilled to announce that we’ve raised a $46M Series B led by our existing investors First Round Capital and a16z. Both of them have had a front-row seat to our fast progress since we announced our Series A last June and wanted to double down. I’m also excited that Stripes, who I have known since our partnership at Flatiron Health, joined this round along with participation from existing investors including BoxGroup, Operator Partners, and SV Angel. They join our amazing group of angels, including Adam Boehler, Founder and Managing Partner of Rubicon Founders and former Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), and Founder of Landmark Health and Puneet Singh, CEO of Carebridge.\n\nWe’re putting this funding to work to address the root causes of the maternal health crisis, especially for populations most at risk. Our incredible patients deserve more from their healthcare, and our tenacious, humble, and passionate team is committed to fighting for our patients to have the best possible outcomes.\n\nAs we enter our next phase of growth at Pomelo, I continue to reflect on the first piece of patient feedback we ever received: “Thanks to you, I finally feel safe.” I’ll never forget it. Now, we have the opportunity to help so many more patients have that feeling that they deserve.\n\nIf you’d like to join our team, we’re hiring at www.pomelocare.com/careers.",

With this funding, we'll be scaling this care model with commercial and Medicaid plans to improve outcomes for patients across the country.\"\n\nMarigold Health, which offers an AI-enhanced peer support chat for people with substance abuse disorders and other mental health issues, closed an $11 million Series A round led by Rock Health and Innospark Ventures.\n\nThe Commonwealth Care Alliance, KdT Ventures, Epsilon Health Investors, VNS Health Plan, Stand Together Ventures Lab, Koa Labs and Wavemaker360 also participated in the round.\n\nThe company offers an anonymous peer support program for individuals with substance use disorder or other mental health conditions. The program includes 24/7 access to text-based support groups and one-on-one coaching from a certified specialist.\n\nThe funds will expand the company's reach, partnerships and peer workforce.\n\n\"Historically, most investment in SUD care has focused on the small minority of people already receiving and open to treatment,\" Shrenik Jain, founder and CEO of Marigold Health, said in a statement.\n\n\"Generally, this treatment isn’t very effective – peer support is the unspoken reality on how most people finally get better. We’re creating a safe place for our members to empower each other and get the best out of a broken system.\"",

It works with more than 2,000 health plans and employers across 175 countries, including Amazon, Microsoft and AT&T. The $125 million Series F funding round was led by StepStone Group and included participation from existing investors General Catalyst, Sequoia, Oak HC/FT, Icon Ventures, Dragoneer Investment Group and Lux Capital. In total, Maven Clinic has raised more than $425 million. The funding brings its valuation to $1.7 billion, according to Reuters . presented by “For a decade, Maven Clinic has defied preconceptions, repeatedly proving that women’s healthcare can be intuitive, technology-first, and high-quality for every customer, from patients to employers to payers and providers,” said Seyonne Kang, partner at StepStone Group, in a statement. “We look forward to seeing Maven continue reimagining healthcare for families in the coming years.” While the company believes it’s “capable of going public,” it’s currently “laser focused on ensuring Maven can help realize the $1 trillion opportunity to boost the global economy with improved women’s healthcare,” Dr. Neel Shah, chief medical officer of Maven Clinic, told MedCity News. The funding will go towards several areas. The company will invest in its fertility benefits administration program called Maven Managed Benefit. This program offers fertility education, trying-to-conceive coaching and access to a network of more than 475 clinics. Maven Clinic will also invest in AI to make its maternity care more personalized. In addition, it will enhance its parenting and pediatrics offering and boost its midlife support, focusing on areas like chronic conditions, sexual wellness and mental health. The company will also advance its value-based partnerships with Medicaid plans and fully-insured plans. “We will double down on our commitment to ensure women and families receive the care they deserve. We will continue to introduce financial and clinical innovation into fertility benefits to ensure families have a seamless experience between physical and digital care,” Shah said. “We will continue to harness the power of large datasets to personalize care journeys and ensure our members have the same opportunities to thrive, whether they are a Medicaid recipient or an employee of a Fortune 50 company.” presented by The women’s health space has historically been underfunded . Although women represent half of the population, just 3% of digital health funding focused on women’s health between 2011 and 2020, according to Rock Health . Maven Clinic’s funding announcement is “validating” for both the women’s health sector and all of digital health, Shah declared. He added that the company’s goal looking ahead is to make sure digital health reaches its full potential. “Brick and mortar health care is essential,” Shah said. “But we all know that health is not produced within the four walls of a hospital. It’s produced in the spaces where we live our lives– in our homes, in our communities, in our workplaces. And to reach people there, outside a 15 minute clinic visit, we need the technological affordances of digital health. Our opportunity is to ensure that the potential of digital health is fully realized.” Other companies in the women’s health space include fertility clinic Kindbody, maternity care company Pomelo Care and menopause support company Evernow.

      "# [Maternal Health Scale-up Pomelo Care Goes Hybrid with Acquisition of The Doula Network by Kathrin Folkendt](https://femtechinsider.com/pomelo-care-acquires-the-doula-network/)\nPomelo Care has announced its acquisition of The Doula Network, the largest network of credentialed doulas in the United States. This acquisition positions Pomelo as the only maternity care model to offer both virtual and in-person services throughout the U.S.\n\nThe Doula Network is recognized for its substantial in-network support with major commercial and Medicaid plans. The acquisition comes at a time when states are increasingly mandating health plans to include doula care, reflecting a growing recognition of its importance in maternity care. It follows Pomelo’s recent $46 million Series B funding round and the publication of peer-reviewed data that highlights improvements in clinical outcomes through its personalized care model. With this integration, Pomelo now covers over 15 million lives, including more than 1 in 6 Medicaid beneficiaries nationally.\n\nThe Doula Network will be fully incorporated into Pomelo’s existing care model, which provides unlimited, 24/7 virtual care from a dedicated team of OBGYNs, pediatricians, midwives, nurses, dietitians, therapists, and lactation experts. Patients will now also have the option to work with a community-based doula, creating a comprehensive support system that addresses medical, behavioral, and social needs to improve outcomes for mothers and infants.\n\nThis hybrid model of care is a first for maternity services in the U.S., combining national reach with localized support to significantly enhance the quality of maternity care available to millions of women. Currently, only 6% of U.S. women receive doula care, but demand is on the rise. Thirteen states and Washington D.C. now require Medicaid reimbursement for doula services, with 30 additional states actively pursuing similar measures.\n\n“Acquiring The Doula Network allows Pomelo Care to offer something never before available at scale in the United States: in-person doula support paired with unparalleled access to evidence-based, virtual care that will dramatically improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes while reducing avoidable costs,” said Marta Bralic Kerns, founder & CEO of Pomelo Care. “Health plans are rapidly integrating doulas into their networks to meet growing demand and they have overwhelmingly chosen The Doula Network as their partner, making them the clear market leader. This in-person, community-focused approach, coupled with our existing virtual care model, will allow us to scale dramatically, accelerate our work delivering evidence-based maternity care, and continue to address the maternity healthcare crisis in America.”\n\nThe U.S. faces a maternity care crisis, with 1 in 10 babies admitted to NICUs and more than a third of counties classified as maternity care deserts. Maternal morbidity rates are concerningly high compared to peer nations, and significant disparities exist in outcomes for women of color.\n\nResearch supports the benefits of doula care, showing that it improves maternity outcomes and promotes health equity, especially for Black mothers. Compared to high-risk pregnant patients without doula support, those who receive doula care are 2x less likely to experience birth complications, 4x less likely to have low-birth-weight babies, and 40% less likely to undergo cesarean deliveries.\n\nPomelo and The Doula Network have both demonstrated significant improvements in maternal and infant health measures across their patient populations. Data reveals that Pomelo’s care model has increased rates of evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis by 2.4x and mental health screening by 7x, while The Doula Network reports a 26.3% cesarean section rate compared to the national average of 32.4%.\n\nElizabeth Simmons, MS, CD, founder and CEO of The Doula Network, will now serve as the Head of Doula Network for Pomelo Care. “By acquiring The Doula Network, Pomelo Care is expanding desperately needed access to evidence-based maternity care and supercharging the doula ecosystem nationwide. With a worsening maternal and infant health crisis and too many women not knowing where to turn for support, this acquisition will allow us to scale our doula network and meet rapidly increasing commercial and Medicaid demand for community-based doulas. I could not be more proud of the company we built and am thrilled to be joining forces with Pomelo Care to bring our high-quality doula care together with Pomelo’s personalized, evidence-based maternity care model.”",
