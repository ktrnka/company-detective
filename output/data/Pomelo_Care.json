Sudden changes to benefits—like offering unlimited PTO and then taking it away while employees are still in training—create confusion and distrust. Giving reasonable notice for these changes would show more care and respect for your team.\n\nThe use of a predictive dialer, similar to what telemarketers use, adds to the stress. There’s no breathing room, and call volume is increased if we’re “available” for too long. It feels like we’re expected to stay glued to our chairs all day, which leads to burnout. Giving employees more flexibility and short breaks could make a big difference.\n\nLastly, using free baby supplies and breast pumps to push enrollments doesn’t align with the mission of providing quality healthcare. It feels like the focus is more on numbers than genuinely helping people.\n\nWhen employees feel valued and supported, we can do our jobs better and represent the company in a way that matches its mission.",

Company relies heavily on asynchronous work and avoids internal meetings, which can lead to highly active Slack threads during non-business hours. Management prioritizes rapid growth over sustainable operations, and clinicians and business staff alike are spread thin. \n\nIn Group / Out Group Dynamic: The majority of the leadership team all came from the same company, and will often spend the first few minutes of all-hands meetings reminiscing about nights out doing karaoke in NYC that the majority of the company was not present for. This can be isolating for new hires who do not have that shared history.\n\nShifting Goalposts: There is a lack of transparency from leadership around role definition, expectations, and success metrics. Employees who achieved or exceeded specific metrics outlined in their bonus plan still did not receive their full bonus. Management is quick to deploy performance plans in lieu of helping employees grow in their roles, which, when paired with an asynchronous, online-only work environment, can create a “sink or swim” culture.",

Company relies heavily on asynchronous work and avoids internal meetings, which can lead to highly active Slack threads during non-business hours. Management prioritizes rapid growth over sustainable operations, and clinicians and business staff alike are spread thin. \n\nIn Group / Out Group Dynamic: The majority of the leadership team all came from the same company, and will often spend the first few minutes of all-hands meetings reminiscing about nights out doing karaoke in NYC that the majority of the company was not present for. This can be isolating for new hires who do not have that shared history.\n\nShifting Goalposts: There is a lack of transparency from leadership around role definition, expectations, and success metrics. Employees who achieved or exceeded specific metrics outlined in their bonus plan still did not receive their full bonus. Management is quick to deploy performance plans in lieu of helping employees grow in their roles, which, when paired with an asynchronous, online-only work environment, can create a “sink or swim” culture.",

      "# [Pomelo Care by Pomelo Care](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/pomelo-care-raises-46-million-and-publishes-data-proving-its-virtual-care-model-improves-outcomes)\nNEW YORK, NY – June 20, 2024 – Pomelo Care, a virtual medical practice that improves maternal and newborn health outcomes, announced $46 million in Series B financing led by existing investors First Round Capital and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) Bio + Health. Pomelo will use this funding to accelerate its partnerships with payors across the country to address the root causes of the maternal health crisis.\n\n‍1 in 10 babies born in the US today start their life in a neonatal intensive care unit. US maternal morbidity and mortality rates are higher than peer countries, and the disparities in outcomes for people of color are unacceptable. Healthcare access continues to worsen, with 1 in 8 births occurring in U.S. counties with limited-to-no access to maternal care. Due to significant gaps in postpartum care, about half of pregnancy-related deaths in the U.S. occur after hospital discharge.\n\nThe evidence exists for how to identify people at highest risk for complications and which interventions are most effective, but existing data gaps and provider capacity challenges make it extremely difficult to apply these interventions at scale.\n\nPomelo has developed a care model that addresses these challenges by analyzing claims and health record data to proactively identify individual risk factors and providing virtual pregnancy, postpartum, and infant care to patients nationwide to reduce those risks, dramatically increasing access to high-quality, evidence-based care and improving outcomes.\n\n“It's rare to come across an opportunity where the incentives between patient, provider and payor are all aligned,” said Josh Kopelman, Partner at First Round Capital and Pomelo board member. “Marta and the Pomelo team have found an incredible opportunity to dramatically improve outcomes for the highest risk populations, while helping payors reduce their avoidable costs.”\n\nPomelo has achieved significant milestones this year including:\n\n$46 million in financing: The company today announced $46 million in Series B financing, bringing total funding to $79 million. The Series B was led by existing investors First Round Capital and a16z. Stripes joined this round along with additional participation from existing investors SV Angel, Operator Partners and BoxGroup. They join angels and healthcare industry leaders Adam Boehler, Founder and Managing Partner of Rubicon Founders, Former Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), and Founder of Landmark Health and Puneet Singh, CEO of CareBridge.\n\nCovering over 3 million lives: Since the beginning of 2024, Pomelo has grown its covered lives with health plan partners from 2 million to over 3 million, providing care to patients in 46 states.\n\nPublished peer-reviewed data proving improvement in clinical outcomes: Pomelo presented new research at the 2024 ACOG Clinical & Scientific Meeting showing that Pomelo’s telemedicine care dramatically scales critical interventions that reduce the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in a Medicaid population – hypertensive disorders like preeclampsia and mental health conditions. Pomelo’s care model increased rates of evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis by 2.4x, proven to reduce preeclampsia risk by 25%, and mental health screening rates by 7x, proven to reduce perinatal depression risk by 40%. This fall, Pomelo will present data at both the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Global Congress and the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference & Exhibition showing reductions in avoidable emergency room, inpatient, and NICU utilization as a result of Pomelo’s care.\n\n“We’ve long known what works to reduce maternal and infant complications. The questions have always been: can you identify the patients who are at highest risk, can you deeply engage them in care to drive uptake of the prevention strategies we know work, and can you do it in the highest risk populations with the most limited access to care?” said Marta Bralic Kerns, Founder & CEO of Pomelo Care. “This data demonstrates that we absolutely can. And with this additional funding, we’ll have the opportunity to scale our care model to more pregnant people across the country.”\n\n“Pomelo is one among a small set of health tech companies that have earned true scale,” shared Vineeta Agarwala, MD, PhD, General Partner at a16z Bio + Health and Pomelo board member. “This scale is evident in our partnerships with major Medicaid and commercial plans covering over 3 million lives, which create the opportunity to collaborate with OB providers, labor and delivery wards, and NICUs nationwide, while serving hundreds of thousands of expecting mothers and newborns with high quality, technology-enabled care.”\n\nAbout Pomelo Care\n\nPomelo Care is a virtual medical practice that addresses underlying risk factors to improve maternal and newborn health, increase access to care and reduce avoidable costs. The company supports its patients from preconception through an infant’s first year with personalized and proactive 24/7 care from a dedicated, multispecialty team. Pomelo works with leading commercial and Medicaid health plans and employers including Penn Medicine, Koch Industries and Elevance Health affiliated plans in Texas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Georgia. Pomelo Care is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, First Round Capital, Stripes, BoxGroup, Operator Partners, SV Angel and Allen & Company LLC.

      "# [Pomelo Care by Marta Bralic Kerns](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/a-new-model-for-maternity-care)\nThree years ago, I met a brilliant woman named Elizabeth Simmons, founder and CEO of The Doula Network, a national network of doulas providing physical, emotional, and educational support to people across the country. I had heard of her because our customers raved about The Doula Network and the outstanding community-based support they provided. Naturally, we had quite a lot to talk about.\n\nAs we chatted about Pomelo’s evidence-based, virtual care model, The Doula Network’s community-based, in-person approach, and the rapidly changing landscape around health plans and doula coverage, it was clear we had a unique opportunity in front of us.\n\nWhich brings us to today.\n\nI am incredibly proud to announce that Pomelo Care has acquired The Doula Network. We are merging our models to create a first for maternity care in the United States: a national hybrid virtual and in-person care model designed to significantly expand access to high-quality maternity care.\n\nThe Unique Impact of Doulas\n\nThere is a national maternity care emergency in the United States. The statistics are appalling: 1 in 10 babies born in the US today is admitted to a NICU, 1 in 8 births occur in counties with low or no access to maternal care, more than a third of counties are maternity care deserts, maternal morbidity rates are higher than peer countries and there are vast, unacceptable disparities in outcomes for women of color.\n\nSince 2021, Pomelo has provided medical care for women during preconception, pregnancy, birth, postpartum, and for both mother and infant during their infant’s first year. The Pomelo approach consists of virtual, round-the-clock care delivered by a dedicated team of obstetric and pediatric clinicians, midwives, nurses, dietitians, therapists, and lactation experts who ensure the patient and her baby have the best possible health outcomes.\n\nWith the addition of The Doula Network, patients may also now be partnered with a community-based doula who will provide consequential support to patients throughout their pregnancy and postpartum period. In addition to providing in-person support, the doulas will become active members of a patient’s virtual care team, and together they will address key medical, behavioral and social factors to improve outcomes for mom, baby, and family.\n\nBut why is doula care so important?\n\nThere is extensive research showing doula care improves maternity outcomes and health equity, particularly among Black mothers.\n\nCompared to high-risk pregnant patients who do not receive doula care, patients under doula care during labor and delivery are 2 times less likely to have a birth complication, 4 times less likely to have a low-birth-weight baby, 40% less likely to have a cesarean delivery, and experience lower rates of preterm birth.\n\nAccording to the March of Dimes, they also experience shorter time in labor, fewer negative childbirth experiences, less anxiety and depression, and are more likely to breastfeed. And importantly, they are more likely to feel happy about the care they received.\n\nThe Doula Network has shown meaningful improvements in key measures of maternal and infant health across their populations, with a 19% cesarean section rate reduction compared to the national average and a 36% low birthweight rate reduction compared to the national average.\n\nThe simple fact is: doulas improve outcomes, lower costs, and reduce disparities. Pomelo Care’s patients will benefit greatly from their addition to our team.\n\nRapidly Growing Demand\n\nWhile the impact of doulas is clear, only 6% of women in the United States currently have coverage for doula care. Historically, health plans have not covered doula services and it has remained largely a cash-pay industry, which can cost several hundred or even several thousand dollars for patients.\n\nDoula coverage has remained limited. According to the Washington Post, “For about six years starting in 2014, Minnesota and Oregon were the only states that mandated coverage of doula services through Medicaid.”\n\nBut recently, things began to change. Through the tireless work of maternal healthcare advocates and key lawmakers, 13 states plus Washington D.C. now require Medicaid reimbursement for doula services, and 30 more states are actively taking steps toward doula reimbursement.\n\nAs health plans are adapting to the new requirements and working to integrate doulas into their networks to meet growing demand, they have overwhelmingly chosen The Doula Network as their partner. Their reputation and results are unparalleled.\n\nAs the largest network of credentialed doulas in the United States, in-network with major commercial and Medicaid plans, The Doula Network has quickly emerged as the clear market leader.\n\nWith this new, integrated care model, Pomelo will significantly expand access to evidence-based maternity care across the United States, invest in the national doula ecosystem, and meet the growing commercial and Medicaid demand for community-based doulas.\n\nWe will also set a new standard for maternity care, where women have access to round-the-clock virtual medical care and the support they need by their side during one of the most exciting and challenging times in their lives.\n\nWe are now in the midst of seamlessly integrating The Doula Network into Pomelo Care and will soon begin offering in-person doula services to our patients.\n\nI am incredibly thankful to the entire Pomelo Care team for working to make this acquisition a reality. And especially grateful for the partnership of Elizabeth, who is joining Pomelo as Head of Doula Network, and The Doula Network team for joining us in our work to address the maternal healthcare crisis and bring high-quality care to every person who needs it.",

      "# [Maternal Health Scale-up Pomelo Care Goes Hybrid with Acquisition of The Doula Network by Kathrin Folkendt on 2024-09-25](https://femtechinsider.com/pomelo-care-acquires-the-doula-network/)\nPomelo Care has announced its acquisition of The Doula Network, the largest network of credentialed doulas in the United States. This acquisition positions Pomelo as the only maternity care model to offer both virtual and in-person services throughout the U.S.\n\nThe Doula Network is recognized for its substantial in-network support with major commercial and Medicaid plans. The acquisition comes at a time when states are increasingly mandating health plans to include doula care, reflecting a growing recognition of its importance in maternity care. It follows Pomelo’s recent $46 million Series B funding round and the publication of peer-reviewed data that highlights improvements in clinical outcomes through its personalized care model. With this integration, Pomelo now covers over 15 million lives, including more than 1 in 6 Medicaid beneficiaries nationally.\n\nThe Doula Network will be fully incorporated into Pomelo’s existing care model, which provides unlimited, 24/7 virtual care from a dedicated team of OBGYNs, pediatricians, midwives, nurses, dietitians, therapists, and lactation experts. Patients will now also have the option to work with a community-based doula, creating a comprehensive support system that addresses medical, behavioral, and social needs to improve outcomes for mothers and infants.\n\nThis hybrid model of care is a first for maternity services in the U.S., combining national reach with localized support to significantly enhance the quality of maternity care available to millions of women. Currently, only 6% of U.S. women receive doula care, but demand is on the rise. Thirteen states and Washington D.C. now require Medicaid reimbursement for doula services, with 30 additional states actively pursuing similar measures.\n\n“Acquiring The Doula Network allows Pomelo Care to offer something never before available at scale in the United States: in-person doula support paired with unparalleled access to evidence-based, virtual care that will dramatically improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes while reducing avoidable costs,” said Marta Bralic Kerns, founder & CEO of Pomelo Care. “Health plans are rapidly integrating doulas into their networks to meet growing demand and they have overwhelmingly chosen The Doula Network as their partner, making them the clear market leader. This in-person, community-focused approach, coupled with our existing virtual care model, will allow us to scale dramatically, accelerate our work delivering evidence-based maternity care, and continue to address the maternity healthcare crisis in America.”\n\nThe U.S. faces a maternity care crisis, with 1 in 10 babies admitted to NICUs and more than a third of counties classified as maternity care deserts. Maternal morbidity rates are concerningly high compared to peer nations, and significant disparities exist in outcomes for women of color.\n\nResearch supports the benefits of doula care, showing that it improves maternity outcomes and promotes health equity, especially for Black mothers. Compared to high-risk pregnant patients without doula support, those who receive doula care are 2x less likely to experience birth complications, 4x less likely to have low-birth-weight babies, and 40% less likely to undergo cesarean deliveries.\n\nPomelo and The Doula Network have both demonstrated significant improvements in maternal and infant health measures across their patient populations. Data reveals that Pomelo’s care model has increased rates of evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis by 2.4x and mental health screening by 7x, while The Doula Network reports a 26.3% cesarean section rate compared to the national average of 32.4%.\n\nElizabeth Simmons, MS, CD, founder and CEO of The Doula Network, will now serve as the Head of Doula Network for Pomelo Care. “By acquiring The Doula Network, Pomelo Care is expanding desperately needed access to evidence-based maternity care and supercharging the doula ecosystem nationwide. With a worsening maternal and infant health crisis and too many women not knowing where to turn for support, this acquisition will allow us to scale our doula network and meet rapidly increasing commercial and Medicaid demand for community-based doulas. I could not be more proud of the company we built and am thrilled to be joining forces with Pomelo Care to bring our high-quality doula care together with Pomelo’s personalized, evidence-based maternity care model.”",

      "# [Introducing The Future 50 by Mario Gabriele on 2024-07-16](https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/future-50-2024)\nFriends,\n\nI am extremely excited to announce the launch of Future 50, a database of the world’s highest potential startups valued at or under $200 million at the time of nomination. It’s the product of a five-month process involving the wisdom of elite venture practitioners, access to confidential information, and detailed independent research.\n\nWhen we first set out to create the Future 50, we asked ourselves a simple question: How can we ensure Generalist supporters know about the world's most promising startups before they become well-known? Our goal was to deliver genuine foresight. Simply hearing about a promising startup at the right moment can serve as an inflection point – for an investor seeking an outlier, a talented operator looking for their next challenge, or a founder seeking inspiration. We became obsessed with creating our version of an early detection system for great companies, driven by our editorial process.\n\nThe Future 50 is a benefit for premium subscribers. If you’re not a member yet and you work in tech or VC, this should justify joining. Just follow the link below.\n\nAbout the awardees\n\nIf you want to learn more about the Future 50, here are a few key details. First, this is a list that spans continents and countries. In total, awardees are headquartered in 11 different countries, to be precise. Awardees are saving mothers’ lives in America, unlocking digital payments in South Africa, buying land for reforestation in Brazil, creating AI models in India, and leveling up brand marketing in New Zealand.\n\nAs those company descriptions suggest, the Future 50 also spans sectors. There are no prizes for guessing the most common sector: AI. Other popular sectors included fintech, SaaS, crypto, and healthcare.\n\nWhat size teams do the Future 50 awardees have? On average, 58.66. The smallest team recorded has 8 people; the largest, 389.\n\nThere’s much more to learn about every awardee. Discover the AI logistics firm clocking $45 million in annual revenue, the public safety startup using drones as first responders, and the next “AWS for biology” by following the link and becoming a member.\n\nOur process\n\nThere are an infinite number of ways you might try and create a list like this one. You could collate it based on perceived status, hard metrics, personal opinion, or the opinion of ceremonial judges. We took a different approach, with a few key characteristics:\n\nCreate a valuation threshold. We started by setting a valuation threshold of $200 million, post-money, at the time of nomination. (Naturally, some companies have raised in the five months since.) It is hard enough to compare a biotech firm to a social media app – it only becomes more so when one is a seed company and the other a Series D scale-up. The $200 million threshold prioritizes companies with real traction and strong products in market, but that still have plenty of room to run, should they succeed in becoming breakout businesses.\n\nFocus on nominator quality, not quantity. We chose an outbound approach, believing it allowed us to create the highest quality list. We contacted many of the world’s best-regarded investors and asked them to nominate companies they consider the highest potential. We started with those we know and consider exceptional pickers. In turn, we asked them to nominate other investors they consider impressive. Finally, we reached out to select practitioners that have global reputations. We only considered nominations from partner-level investors. Overall, investors from nearly every Tier 1 fund participated.\n\nPush to the edges. We believe many of the most impactful companies will be built outside the United States. To ensure global coverage, we proactively sought elite venture investors from Latin America, Africa, Europe, Oceania, and Asia. As you’ll discover, the list includes many stellar organizations from beyond Silicon Valley.\n\nForce stack ranking to avoid over-nominating. As noted, we asked every investor to nominate the two companies they considered particularly high potential with an explanation for each. (Some investors ended up sharing a few more, which we considered.) Ultimately, our goal was not to solicit as many nominations as possible but to encourage nominators to make difficult choices, selecting those they consider the very best of the best. As a note, Generalist Capital is an investor in some of the companies nominated. I did not nominate any companies myself, but have noted any investment in the interest of transparency.\n\nPersonally study each company. After receiving an extremely strong cadre of nominations, I personally reviewed each one. This involved reading the investors’ rationales and studying the company directly via its website and associated press. We used this to filter the list down to a select few finalists.\n\nRequest exclusive, confirmatory information. We reached out to the finalists directly and asked them to share data confirming their valuation at the time of the nomination, cumulative capital raised, and revenue run rate. We also asked them to outline their primary sources of differentiation and highlight other traction they consider notable. Companies have allowed some of this data to be shared publicly; the rest remains confidential but was invaluable in our assessments.\n\nMake final judgments. We used the information gleaned from companies to choose our final 50. This relied on me personally reviewing all additional data supplied by the companies. In making our choice, we factored in metrics but also recognized that great companies have different commercial maturation rates.\n\nProvide detailed descriptions and clear rationales. One of our frustrations with lists is that they are often light on detail. For each awardee of the Future 50, you will find a strong synopsis of the business and why it matters. You will also find a bullet-pointed rationale explaining its inclusion: what we liked about it and why.\n\nNo process is perfect, and there are certainly trade-offs to our approach, but it’s enabled us to create something unique: a global, detailed, actionable list of potentially legendary companies – many of which I had never heard of before.\n\nWhat you can expect\n\nBy joining as a member and unlocking the full Future 50, here’s what you can expect:\n\nAn incredible list. Fifty high-potential startups, nominated by elite investors, supported by exclusive data, and curated by The Generalist.\n\nEasy-to-grasp descriptions. We explain what each company does and why it matters in clear language. You don’t need to be a sectoral expert to understand their potential.\n\nA point-by-point rationale. We give four reasons why we chose every awardee, giving you a deeper understanding of each business.\n\nTraction details. We include information on key customers, ARR, and other signs of traction whenever possible. You’ll get a sense for just how far along they are.\n\nLinks to leadership. We’ve added LinkedIn URLs that make it easy to review the people behind the businesses.\n\nHeadcount information. Virtually every awardee shared up-to-date headcount information, helping you gauge the size of their operations.\n\nAn embedded database. If you want a fast way to scan the list or filter by location or sector, you can use the Airtable we’ve created. It’s included in the Future 50 piece. Here’s a hint of what it looks like:\n\nJoin us now to unlock the full database and learn about 50 of the world’s highest-potential startups.\n\nBrought to you by Mercury\n\nIf Jony Ive built a banking* experience…\n\nIt would look a lot like Mercury. The Generalist has been a Mercury customer for years, and I’m constantly awed by the platform’s beauty, thoughtfulness, and power. It’s become a core part of how we run our business and is probably the only banking product I find a genuine pleasure to use.\n\nMercury’s banking experience isn’t just loved by The Generalist.
