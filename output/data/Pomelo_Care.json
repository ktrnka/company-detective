      "# [Pomelo Care by Marta Bralic Kerns](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/scaling-maternal-care-that-works)\nI started Pomelo because 1 in 10 babies born in the US today starts their life in a neonatal intensive care unit. Maternal morbidity and mortality rates are higher than our peer countries, and the disparities in outcomes for people of color are unacceptable. The evidence exists for how to identify people at highest risk and which interventions are most effective, but there just isnât enough capacity in the healthcare system to apply these interventions at scale.\n\nWe are addressing these challenges head on by analyzing claims and health record data to identify individual risk factors, and providing virtual pregnancy, postpartum, and infant care to patients across the country to reduce those risks, dramatically increasing access and improving outcomes.\n\nâCovering 3 million lives with health plan partners\n\nWeâre proud of the milestones weâve achieved over the last year. Since just the beginning of 2024, weâve grown from 2 million covered lives to over 3 million today and are serving patients in 46 states through our commercial and Medicaid health plan partners. And weâre expanding access to quality care for patients: one-third of our care occurs outside of traditional office hours, when patients have real and often urgent needs, but typically canât access care outside of a hospital.\n\nâPublished data that shows our model is working\n\nMost importantly, weâve proven the impact of our care on patients. The evidence is clear on what needs to be done to prevent the severe complications of preeclampsia and perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) â two of the leading drivers of maternal mortality and morbidity in the US. We know that a low dose aspirin regimen reduces preeclampsia risk by 25%, but fewer than 25% of high risk patients start taking aspirin and that too few patients are screened for PMADs and offered timely treatment.\n\nLast month, we presented new data at the ACOG Annual Clinical & Scientific Meeting showing that Pomeloâs telemedicine care dramatically improves both evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis rates (by 2.4x) and mental health screening rates (by 7x) in a Medicaid population.\n\nThis fall, weâll present data at both the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Global Congress and the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference & Exhibition showing reductions in emergency room, inpatient, and NICU utilization as a result of Pomeloâs care.\n\nBehind these statistics are patients whose lives changed because they got the care they needed.Â\n\nLike Ava, who had preeclampsia during her first pregnancy and was now pregnant with her second baby, putting her at high risk of developing preeclampsia again. Our provider recommended that she start taking daily low-dose aspirin and spent time sharing the evidence and addressing concerns about taking medication during pregnancy. When Avaâs Pomelo nurse checked in a couple days later to see if she had started her daily aspirin regimen, Ava said she hadn't because she couldn't afford the out-of-pocket cost. Her care team quickly jumped into action to find a bottle of 100 low-dose aspirin for $4 at a local store. Ava started taking low-dose aspirin and stuck with it â significantly reducing her risk of developing preeclampsia. She avoided preeclampsia altogether and delivered at term, with no NICU stay.\n\nWeâve long known what works to address the maternal health crisis. The critical questions have always been: can you identify the patients who are at highest risk, can you deeply engage them in care and drive uptake of the prevention strategies we know work, and can you do it in the highest risk populations with the most limited access to care?\n\nWith this data, we proved that we absolutely can.\n\nâNew funding to continue to increase access to evidence-based care\n\nToday, Iâm thrilled to announce that weâve raised a $46M Series B led by our existing investors First Round Capital and a16z. Both of them have had a front-row seat to our fast progress since we announced our Series A last June and wanted to double down. Iâm also excited that Stripes, who I have known since our partnership at Flatiron Health, joined this round along with participation from existing investors including BoxGroup, Operator Partners, and SV Angel. They join our amazing group of angels, including Adam Boehler, Founder and Managing Partner of Rubicon Founders and former Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), and Founder of Landmark Health and Puneet Singh, CEO of Carebridge.\n\nWeâre putting this funding to work to address the root causes of the maternal health crisis, especially for populations most at risk. Our incredible patients deserve more from their healthcare, and our tenacious, humble, and passionate team is committed to fighting for our patients to have the best possible outcomes.\n\nAs we enter our next phase of growth at Pomelo, I continue to reflect on the first piece of patient feedback we ever received: âThanks to you, I finally feel safe.â Iâll never forget it. Now, we have the opportunity to help so many more patients have that feeling that they deserve.Â\n\nIf youâd like to join our team, weâre hiring at www.pomelocare.com/careers.",

      "# [Pomelo Care by Marta Bralic Kerns](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/a-new-model-for-maternity-care)\nThree years ago, I met a brilliant woman named Elizabeth Simmons, founder and CEO of The Doula Network, a national network of doulas providing physical, emotional, and educational support to people across the country. I had heard of her because our customers raved about The Doula Network and the outstanding community-based support they provided.Â Naturally, we had quite a lot to talk about.\n\nAs we chatted about Pomeloâs evidence-based, virtual care model, The Doula Networkâs community-based, in-person approach, and the rapidly changing landscape around health plans and doula coverage, it was clear we had a unique opportunity in front of us.Â\n\nWhich brings us to today.Â\n\nI am incredibly proud to announce that Pomelo Care has acquired The Doula Network. We are merging our models to create a first for maternity care in the United States: a national hybrid virtual and in-person care model designed to significantly expand access to high-quality maternity care.\n\nThe Unique Impact of Doulas\n\nThere is a national maternity care emergency in the United States. The statistics are appalling: 1 in 10 babies born in the US today is admitted to a NICU, 1 in 8 births occur in counties with low or no access to maternal care, more than a third of counties are maternity care deserts, maternal morbidity rates are higher than peer countries and there are vast, unacceptable disparities in outcomes for women of color.\n\nSince 2021, Pomelo has provided medical care for women during preconception, pregnancy, birth, postpartum, and for both mother and infant during their infantâs first year. The Pomelo approach consists of virtual, round-the-clock care delivered by a dedicated team of obstetric and pediatric clinicians, midwives, nurses, dietitians, therapists, and lactation experts who ensure the patient and her baby have the best possible health outcomes.Â\n\nWith the addition of The Doula Network, patients may also now be partnered with a community-based doula who will provide consequential support to patients throughout their pregnancy and postpartum period. In addition to providing in-person support, the doulas will become active members of a patientâs virtual care team, and together they will address key medical, behavioral and socialÂ factors to improve outcomes for mom, baby, and family.\n\nBut why is doula care so important?Â\n\nThere is extensive research showing doula care improves maternity outcomes and health equity, particularly among Black mothers.Â\n\nCompared to high-risk pregnant patients who do not receive doula care, patients under doula care during labor and delivery are 2 times less likely to have a birth complication, 4 times less likely to have a low-birth-weight baby, 40% less likely to have a cesarean delivery, and experience lower rates of preterm birth.Â\n\nAccording to the March of Dimes, they also experience shorter time in labor, fewer negative childbirth experiences, less anxiety and depression, and are more likely to breastfeed. And importantly, they are more likely to feel happy about the care they received.Â\n\nThe Doula Network has shown meaningful improvements in key measures of maternal and infant health across their populations, with a 19% cesarean section rate reduction compared to the national average and a 36% low birthweight rate reduction compared to the national average.Â\n\nThe simple fact is: doulas improve outcomes, lower costs, and reduce disparities. Pomelo Careâs patients will benefit greatly from their addition to our team.\n\nRapidly Growing Demand\n\nWhile the impact of doulas is clear, only 6% of women in the United States currently have coverage for doula care. Historically, health plans have not covered doula services and it has remained largely a cash-pay industry, which can cost several hundred or even several thousand dollars for patients.\n\nDoula coverage has remained limited. According to the Washington Post,Â âFor about six years starting in 2014, Minnesota and Oregon were the only states that mandated coverage of doula services through Medicaid.â\n\nBut recently, things began to change. Through the tireless work of maternal healthcare advocates and key lawmakers, 13 states plus Washington D.C. now require Medicaid reimbursement for doula services, and 30 more states are actively taking steps toward doula reimbursement.\n\nAs health plans are adapting to the new requirements and working to integrate doulas into their networks to meet growing demand, they have overwhelmingly chosen The Doula Network as their partner. Their reputation and results are unparalleled.Â\n\nAs the largest network of credentialed doulas in the United States, in-network with major commercial and Medicaid plans, The Doula Network has quickly emerged as the clear market leader.Â\n\nWith this new, integrated care model, Pomelo will significantly expand access to evidence-based maternity care across the United States, invest in the national doula ecosystem, and meet the growing commercial and Medicaid demand for community-based doulas.Â\n\nWe will also set a new standard for maternity care, where women have access to round-the-clock virtual medical care and the support they need by their side during one of the most exciting and challenging times in their lives.Â\n\nWe are now in the midst of seamlessly integrating The Doula Network into Pomelo Care and will soon begin offering in-person doula services to our patients.\n\nI am incredibly thankful to the entire Pomelo Care team for working to make this acquisition a reality. And especially grateful for the partnership of Elizabeth, who is joining Pomelo as Head of Doula Network, and The Doula Network team for joining us in our work to address the maternal healthcare crisis and bring high-quality care to every person who needs it.",
      "# [Pomelo Care by Sherry Shenker](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/getting-to-know-pomelos-data-science-team)\nAt Pomelo, we are scaling a virtual value-based maternity care model to improve access, reduce disparities, and eliminate healthcare gaps for families nationwide. We constantly use data to better understand our patients' needs and behaviors, make our clinicians more efficient, and measure our impact on outcomes.\n\nWe sat down with Sherry, a data scientist, to learn more about what makes Pomelo's data team unique.Â\n\nWhy did you decide to join Pomelo?\n\nIn college, I learned about data science through my interest in public policy and civic technology. I discovered a community tackling problems to improve people's lives, from replacing lead pipes to improving access to government benefits and using data to design more efficient and scalable solutions.Â Over the years, I sought out roles where I could work on challenging, high-impact problems, wear many different hats, and be on teams with smart, thoughtful people.\n\nWhen I learned that Pomelo was building a scalable way to improve maternal health outcomes, my initial reaction was, \"How does this not already exist?\"Â I was excited to join a company with an ambitious, impactful mission and so many opportunities to use data to help drive its success.Â\n\nHow does the data team at Pomelo operate?\n\nEvery company says data is core to its work, but data is genuinely core to how every function at Pomelo operates. We use data to identify eligible patients, understand patient risk factors and prior medical history, and measure the success of our interventions in engaging patients and improving outcomes.Â Â\n\nOur Insights team comprises data scientists, software engineers, data engineers, and product managers and supports the business's data needs. As our company and priorities have changed over time, the problems we focus on and the tools we use have evolved, too. As we navigate this change, our team follows a few important, constant principles âÂ\n\nWe invest in centralizing our data and building core data models. Before I joined Pomelo, the team invested in storing all patient health information in a centralized FHIR store, a data standard that we use as the source of truth for every Pomelo patient's health history. We also set up a centralized data warehouse for storing data on everything from clinical interactions and outcomes to marketing and patient engagement. Finally, we continuously build dbt models that standardize and transform data on key entities that we then use as the starting point for more complex analyses.Â\n\nWe make analytics-ready data accessible across the whole company.Â With a small data team and a very data-driven culture, there are more daily data requests than we could handle if we completed each one ourselves. So, we use a BI tool that enables anyone at Pomelo to easily modify dashboards and charts (or build their own!). Stakeholders can view key metrics, answer ad-hoc questions, and form hypotheses.Â Making analytics self-service enables teams to get answers to their data questions faster and allows the data team to focus on building scalable, self-service data products and tackling new, more complex challenges.Â\n\nWe work directly with other functions to understand challenges and design solutions. Every data scientist knows that working cross-functionally is part of the job. At Pomelo, we collaborate with stakeholders across teams every day. The data team joins early discussions in new problem areas to gather context before building a solution. We shadow and ask our nurses, providers, and specialists questions when solving patient care problems. Data science at Pomelo goes beyond building dashboards and reports â we scope pilots and implement new solutions to address challenges from patient outreach to engagement to outcomes measurement.Â Â\n\nHow do you think about measuring success at Pomelo?\n\nAs Pomelo quickly grows to serve more and more patients every month, we need to simultaneously be able to measure our impact on patient outcomes and continuously identify where and how we need to improve. To give a few examples, we need to understand:Â Â\n\nWhich interventions impact patient outcomes most, such as reduced avoidable Emergency Department visits and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) admissions?Â\n\nWhich patients engage the most in our programs? Who are the patients we aren't currently engaging but should be, and how do we engage them?Â\n\nHow do improved outcomes translate to healthcare cost savings for our payer partners?Â\n\nAnswering these questions is not a month- or quarter-long project; defining and measuring patient outcomes is perpetual, given how often we experiment and evolve our care model.Â The work we've done to characterize patients' interactions, risk factors, and outcomes is the foundation for all of our in-flight and upcoming work, aiming to answer questions like the ones above and inform the decisions that enable us to scaleÂ Â Â\n\nWe are just getting started and looking for more impact-driven, collaborative data people to join our team.

Our technology is a crucial aspect of how we scale.\n\nWe sat down with software engineer Julia Dai to learn about the engineering team at Pomelo.Â\n\nVisit our Careers page to learn more about open roles if you're interested in becoming part of our team.\n\nWhy did you decide to join Pomelo?\n\nAfter starting my career at big tech companies, I was looking for a smaller, tighter-knit team and a mission aligned with my interest in healthcare. Pomelo is addressing a very real, worsening maternal and newborn health crisis in the US. That really resonated. After I met the engineering team â who were so smart, kind, and excited about their work â I knew it was the right next step for me.\n\nNow that Iâve been at Pomelo for almost a year, I feel truly fortunate to be a part of the team. Everyone at Pomelo â from engineering to outreach, clinical, and beyond â is so talented and excellent at what they do. Weâre constantly collaborating to reach our goals and set the bar even higher for what we can achieve. Every day, Iâm excited by the tangible impacts of our products. For me personally, itâs also been so valuable to learn from experienced engineers who are team players and strong mentors.\n\nHow does the engineering team power Pomeloâs mission?\n\nAt Pomelo, we keep our patients at the center of everything we do. On the engineering team, this means weâre building products and features that streamline how we deliver care to improve patient outcomes and deliver a top tier patient experience.\n\nGrove is our clinical teamâs central command center. Our clinicians use it to communicate with patients, coordinate across care teams, and deliver evidence-based care to improve patient outcomes. Groveâs intelligent workflows and design enable our clinicians to provide timely, personalized care based on each patientâs individual risk factors.\n\nOur data engine powers our care model by identifying individual risk factors and proactively surfacing those risks to our clinical teams in Grove. We ingest and synthesize data from claims, lab, pharmacy, and electronic health record data. Itâs exciting to see how the combination of our data and software have such a meaningful impact on our patientsâ care and our cliniciansâ experience.Â\n\nWhat Pomelo project are you most proud of?\n\nOne of my first projects at Pomelo was actually born out of a mini-hackathon at our company-wide offsite. My teamâs hack used GPT-4 to enable efficient and comprehensive clinical documentation.\n\nI worked with one of our clinicians, Kat, to build a feature that leveraged generative AI to automatically create summaries based on recent clinical interactions. After an impactful demo at the hackathon, I was able to spend the rest of the quarter developing and launching the feature. Itâs been a huge win for patients and clinicians alike. Our patients are heard, and their whole care team has the full context on their care needs and goals. Our clinicians can focus on delivering care, rather than documentation.Â\n\nIâm really proud of this collaboration between engineering and clinical teams. As a more junior engineer, it was super rewarding for me to have led the project end-to-end, working cross-functionally to deliver meaningful improvements for our team and our patients.\n\nWhat makes the Pomelo engineering team special?\n\nOne of the most unique things about my day-to-day is how closely I work alongside our clinicians. Engineers regularly shadow clinicians to understand product pain points, and see firsthand how this impacts cliniciansâ workflows. This direct feedback channel allows us to quickly iterate on meaningful product improvements.\n\nEngineers are also deeply attuned to the impact we have on patientsâ lives. We hear anonymous patient stories from our clinical team at our company-wide all-hands meetings, and itâs a powerful reminder of each patientâs unique journey. I love hearing how our teamâs combined efforts have a positive impact on our patients and their families.Â Â\n\nEven though our engineering team is distributed all across the US, we stay connected throughout the week to problem solve, share updates, and get feedback. Some team members in New York and San Francisco like to meet up in person regularly, and the whole team gets together for offsites several times a year so we can build relationships, co-work, and have some fun. Pomelo is very big on karaoke.\n\nWhat excites you about Pomeloâs future?\n\nSo many things! Itâs been a very exciting past few weeks as weâve launched health plans in new markets, serving more high-risk and non-English speaking patients. This gives us the opportunity to deliver our care model and improved outcomes to even more patients. As we grow, weâre also thinking about interesting challenges that come with scale, like standardizing patient care for our growing clinical team, surfacing higher-risk patients for care as early as possible, and integrating massive amounts of heterogeneous data. Iâm energized by whatâs ahead!",
      "# [Pomelo Care by Marta Bralic Kerns](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/making-evidence-based-pregnancy-and-newborn-care-universal)\nI started my career in a basement room at a state Medicaid agency designing an alternative payment model for maternity care. As I dug through claims and set quality measure benchmarks, I didnât realize the evidence of a national maternal health crisis was buried in those countless lines of data. Today, pregnancy complications remain on the rise, with one in ten newborns starting their life in the NICU and cesarean births increasing 41% over the last two decades. Even more stunning, the maternal mortality rate in the U.S. is more than three times the rate in most other high-income countries, with BIPOC women 2-3x more likely than white women to die from such complications.\n\nYears later, when I had my daughter, Mia, and son, Luka, I experienced a preeclampsia scare, emergency room visits, and a large for gestational age baby. With only a few minutes a month with my OB/GYN, I faced these challenges with many more questions than answers. Millions of other women face similar and more daunting issues â patients like Shelly, one of Pomelo's patients who was gracious enough to share her story with me.\n\nShelly was overjoyed to become a first time mom at 43 after trying to conceive for many years, but she faced some unexpected complications. Gallstones sent her to the emergency room, where doctors advised her to cut all fat from her diet to prevent them from coming back. She left feeling confused and limited as to what she could eat. Shelly also risked developing gestational diabetes, which increases the risk of preeclampsia and preterm birth. Overwhelmed, she hit dead ends looking for answers on Google despite wanting to make changes to keep herself and her baby healthy.\n\nI started Pomelo Care to help people like Shelly â and families all across the country â have healthy pregnancies and healthy babies.\n\nWe designed our approach around three core tenets:\n\nWe need to increase access to care, close care gaps, and reduce the friction of getting care for families â weâre available 24/7 with expert maternal and pediatric care teams.\n\nMany pregnancy risk factors are known and addressable â we created data infrastructure to identify these risks earlier by analyzing claims, lab, pharmacy, and electronic health record data, and we surface patient needs to clinicians in real-time via our software platform so a holistic care team can address these risks by treating medical, behavioral, and social needs in concert.\n\nWe need a value-based care model that improves outcomes for both mother and baby â we are laser focused on delivering evidence-based care that improves outcomes and reduces costs from avoidable complications.\n\nFrom my early work in Medicaid to my own pregnancies, to conversations Iâve had with clinical leaders in our field, Iâve long been frustrated by poor access to care, late or no identification and management of risk factors, and the lack of a value-based payment model to change the status quo. So thatâs what weâve built.\n\nPomelo Care is a virtual, multi-speciality medical practice that uses a value-based care model to address underlying risk factors to improve maternal and newborn health. We provide 24/7 virtual care for patients from preconception until their baby turns one. Our team of OB/GYN, primary care, and pediatric clinicians, mental health therapists, social workers, dietitians, lactation consultants, and other experts care for the whole person. By proactively identifying and treating individual risk factors wherever a patient is â in their life and in the country â we aim to give everyone the personalized, holistic care previously only available to a select few. And we partner with health plans to deliver this care at no cost to patients.\n\nWhen we met Shelly, we worked with her to create a personalized care plan that met her unique needs and goals. After learning of her gestational diabetes risk, she met with a Pomelo dietitian several times for nutrition counseling and meal planning. She saw a therapist to navigate the ups and downs of pregnancy. Before giving birth, she consulted a lactation specialist to help prepare for breastfeeding. Our team supported Shelly every step of the way and answered all her questions big and small. Shelly never developed gestational diabetes, and she gave birth to a healthy baby boy. Her Pomelo care team continues to help Shelly navigate new milestones like introducing solids to her son, now seven months old. Supporting patients like Shelly is what drives us to reach more patients faster.\n\nSince 2021, weâve been working with leading health plans, managed care organizations including the two largest Medicaid payers, employers including Mount Sinai Health System and Koch Industries, and academic medical centers to improve maternal and newborn health.\n\nToday, Iâm excited to announce that weâve raised $33 million in venture capital funding, led by Andreessen Horowitz and First Round Capital to expand access to evidence-based care to 2 million covered lives this year.\n\nTheyâre joined by SV Angel, Operator Partners, Allen & Company LLC, and BoxGroup, as well as incredible angel investors and healthcare industry leaders, including Adam Boehler (Managing Partner of Rubicon Founders, Former Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, and Founder of Landmark Health), Nat Turner (Co-founder of Flatiron Health), and Puneet Singh (Former Chief Growth Officer, Diversified Business Group at Elevance). This funding will allow us to scale our technology, clinical, and operating teams to meet the needs of a growing patient population.\n\nI donât underestimate the challenge ahead. The maternal health crisis is only getting worse, and care access is increasingly under threat. But we know which interventions can turn the tide in this crisis, thanks to the dedicated efforts of maternal health clinicians and researchers. The challenge is to make these interventions accessible to everyone who needs them. Our team of passionate, smart, humble, and caring people is committed to fighting like hell to break down barriers to accessibility and finally improve outcomes for millions of patients across the country.",

      "# [Pomelo Care by Pomelo Care](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/pomelo-care-presents-data-at-acog-2024-demonstrating-care-model-impact)\nPomelo Care presented data presented at the 2024 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Clinical and Scientific Meeting that showed a 7x increase in depression and anxiety screening and a 2.4x increase in aspirin prophylaxis for preeclampsia prevention in a Medicaid population â impacting two of the leading drivers of maternal morbidity mortality.\n\nPregnancy-related conditions, including mental health and hypertensive disorders, adversely affect outcomes for women and babies nationwide. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity in the U.S., affecting 1 in 7 hospital deliveries. Mental health conditions are the leading underlying cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the US. However, fewer than 20% of women self-report symptoms of perinatal depression, highlighting an opportunity for better mental health screening to identify symptoms and initiate treatment to improve outcomes.Â\n\nExisting clinical interventions are proven to reduce the risk of preeclampsia by 25% and perinatal depression risk by 40%. Despite these known interventions, patients continue to develop these conditions at alarming rates due to limited and worsening access to maternal care and low rates of these evidence-based interventions, particularly among Medicaid patients. The most recent HEDIS data indicates that only 8.8% of Medicaid patients are screened prenatally for depression. And just 25% or less of pregnant patients with an elevated risk of developing preeclampsia initiate aspirin prophylaxis to reduce preeclampsia risk.\n\nNew data from Pomelo demonstrates that its virtual care program effectively scales data-backed interventions to address both preeclampsia and PMAD risk among a Medicaid population. Pomeloâs data showed a:",

      "# [Pomelo Care by Pomelo Care](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/pomelo-care-raises-46-million-and-publishes-data-proving-its-virtual-care-model-improves-outcomes)\nNEW YORK, NY â June 20, 2024 â Pomelo Care, a virtual medical practice that improves maternal and newborn health outcomes, announced $46 million in Series B financing led by existing investors First Round Capital and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) Bio + Health. Pomelo will use this funding to accelerate its partnerships with payors across the country to address the root causes of the maternal health crisis.\n\nâ1 in 10 babies born in the US today start their life in a neonatal intensive care unit. US maternal morbidity and mortality rates are higher than peer countries, and the disparities in outcomes for people of color are unacceptable. Healthcare access continues to worsen, with 1 in 8 births occurring in U.S. counties with limited-to-no access to maternal care. Due to significant gaps in postpartum care, about half of pregnancy-related deaths in the U.S. occur after hospital discharge.Â\n\nThe evidence exists for how to identify people at highest risk for complications and which interventions are most effective, but existing data gaps and provider capacity challenges make it extremely difficult to apply these interventions at scale.\n\nPomelo has developed a care model that addresses these challenges by analyzing claims and health record data to proactively identify individual risk factors and providing virtual pregnancy, postpartum, and infant care to patients nationwide to reduce those risks, dramatically increasing access to high-quality, evidence-based care and improving outcomes.\n\nâIt's rare to come across an opportunity where the incentives between patient, provider and payor are all aligned,â said Josh Kopelman, Partner at First Round Capital and Pomelo board member. âMarta and the Pomelo team have found an incredible opportunity to dramatically improve outcomes for the highest risk populations, while helping payors reduce their avoidable costs.â\n\nPomelo has achieved significant milestones this year including:\n\n$46 million in financing: The company today announced $46 million in Series B financing, bringing total funding to $79 million. The Series B was led by existing investors First Round Capital and a16z. Stripes joined this round along with additional participation from existing investors SV Angel, Operator Partners and BoxGroup. They join angels and healthcare industry leaders Adam Boehler, Founder and Managing Partner of Rubicon Founders, Former Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), and Founder of Landmark Health and Puneet Singh, CEO of CareBridge.\n\nCovering over 3 million lives: Since the beginning of 2024, Pomelo has grown its covered lives with health plan partners from 2 million to over 3 million, providing care to patients in 46 states.Â\n\nPublished peer-reviewed data proving improvement in clinical outcomes: Pomelo presented new research at the 2024 ACOG Clinical & Scientific Meeting showing that Pomeloâs telemedicine care dramatically scales critical interventions that reduce the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in a Medicaid population â hypertensive disorders like preeclampsia and mental health conditions. Pomeloâs care model increased rates of evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis by 2.4x, proven to reduce preeclampsia risk by 25%, and mental health screening rates by 7x, proven to reduce perinatal depression risk by 40%. This fall, Pomelo will present data at both the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Global Congress and the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference & Exhibition showing reductions in avoidable emergency room, inpatient, and NICU utilization as a result of Pomeloâs care.\n\nâWeâve long known what works to reduce maternal and infant complications. The questions have always been: can you identify the patients who are at highest risk, can you deeply engage them in care to drive uptake of the prevention strategies we know work, and can you do it in the highest risk populations with the most limited access to care?â said Marta Bralic Kerns, Founder & CEO of Pomelo Care. âThis data demonstrates that we absolutely can. And with this additional funding, weâll have the opportunity to scale our care model to more pregnant people across the country.â\n\nâPomelo is one among a small set of health tech companies that have earned true scale,â shared Vineeta Agarwala, MD, PhD, General Partner at a16z Bio + Health and Pomelo board member. âThis scale is evident in our partnerships with major Medicaid and commercial plans covering over 3 million lives, which create the opportunity to collaborate with OB providers, labor and delivery wards, and NICUs nationwide, while serving hundreds of thousands of expecting mothers and newborns with high quality, technology-enabled care.â\n\nAbout Pomelo Care\n\nPomelo Care is a virtual medical practice that addresses underlying risk factors to improve maternal and newborn health, increase access to care and reduce avoidable costs. The company supports its patients from preconception through an infantâs first year with personalized and proactive 24/7 care from a dedicated, multispecialty team. Pomelo works with leading commercial and Medicaid health plans and employers including Penn Medicine, Koch Industries and Elevance Health affiliated plans in Texas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Georgia.

      "# [Pomelo Care by Pomelo Care](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/pomelo-care-secures-33m-to-deliver-value-based-care-and-improve-maternal-and-newborn-health)\nNEW YORK, NY â June 8, 2023 â Pomelo Care, a virtual medical practice that improves maternal and newborn health outcomes, today announced $33 million in Seed and Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz. The capital will fuel Pomeloâs continued partnership expansion with major health plans, including several Medicaid managed care organizations, employers and leading academic medical centers on the front lines of the national maternal health crisis.Â\n\nPomeloâs multispecialty team of expert clinicians cares for mothers and infants from preconception through pregnancy, birth and one year postpartum, spanning everything from prenatal care to nutrition and lactation to mental health. Its value-based virtual care model pairs each patient with a personalized care team to comprehensively address maternal health inequities and the root causes of poor outcomes. Pomelo uses data to predict and proactively identify risk, provides holistic care leveraging evidence-based protocols and novel care programs and makes 24/7 care accessible via phone, text and video.Â\n\nâWe know that the right care at the right time can dramatically improve outcomes for families. Everyone deserves access to high-quality care, regardless of their circumstances or health plan,â said Marta Bralic Kerns, founder and CEO at Pomelo Care. âThatâs why Pomelo exists â we address patient concerns right away and at home, keeping them out of the emergency room unnecessarily and lowering their risk of pregnancy, postpartum and newborn complications.âÂ\n\nSince its founding in 2021, Pomelo has achieved significant milestones, including:\n\n$33 million in capital raised: The company today announced Series A financing, which follows its 2021 Seed round. Andreessen Horowitz led both funding rounds, with additional participating investors First Round Capital (who co-led the Seed round), SV Angel, Operator Partners, Allen & Company LLC and BoxGroup, joined by angel investors and healthcare industry leaders including Adam Boehler, Managing Partner of Rubicon Founders, Former Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), and Founder of Landmark Health and Puneet Singh, Former Chief Growth Officer, Diversified Business Group at Elevance.\n\nOn track to cover two million lives this year: Pomelo currently serves patients in 44 states and partners with national payers, several of the largest Medicaid managed care organizations in the country, employers including Mount Sinai Health System and leading academic medical centers including Penn Medicine.Â\n\n> 4.9/5 average patient satisfaction: Pomelo provides 24/7 access to care with one-third of patient interactions taking place outside of traditional clinic hours and an average response time of five minutes.\n\nDespite spending $111 billion annually on maternal healthcare, the U.S. has some of the highest rates of preterm birth, NICU admissions and preventable maternal complications in the developed world. Maternal mortality worsened during the pandemic, with poor maternal and newborn outcomes remaining even more common in communities of color and rural areas. One in ten newborns start their life in the NICU and cesarean births have increased 41% over the last two decades. However, with evidence-based and accessible interventions, preterm births can be reduced by 33%, cesarean deliveries reduced by 40% and the average NICU stay reduced by at least four days.Â\n\nPomeloâs team consists of clinicians â 50% of whom are BIPOC â technologists and executives, with backgrounds at leading hospitals, academic medical centers and technology companies. The teamâs previous experience spans Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Duke University Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Flatiron Health, Kaiser Permanente, Emory University Hospital, Google and Stripe. Pomelo also announced the appointment of Vineeta Agarwala, MD, PhD, General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, and Josh Kopelman, Partner at First Round Capital, to the companyâs board of directors.Â\n\n\"Itâs inexcusable that women in the U.S. face one of the highest national mortality rates from preventable complications during pregnancy â and this statistic is only worsening year over year due to social disparities and systemic gaps in care delivery and access,â said Agarwala. âPomelo Careâs technology-driven, value-based care model completely reimagines how new families access high quality specialty care and achieve better outcomes while also reducing costs for our leading health plans, health systems and employers.âÂ\n\nTo learn more about Pomelo or to get started as a health plan or employer, please visit: https://www.pomelocare.com/Â\n\nâ\n\nAbout Pomelo Care\n\nPomelo Care is a virtual medical practice that addresses underlying risk factors to improve maternal and newborn health, increase access to care and reduce avoidable costs.

Company relies heavily on asynchronous work and avoids internal meetings, which can lead to highly active Slack threads during non-business hours. Management prioritizes rapid growth over sustainable operations, and clinicians and business staff alike are spread thin. \n\nIn Group / Out Group Dynamic: The majority of the leadership team all came from the same company, and will often spend the first few minutes of all-hands meetings reminiscing about nights out doing karaoke in NYC that the majority of the company was not present for. This can be isolating for new hires who do not have that shared history.\n\nShifting Goalposts: There is a lack of transparency from leadership around role definition, expectations, and success metrics. Employees who achieved or exceeded specific metrics outlined in their bonus plan still did not receive their full bonus. Management is quick to deploy performance plans in lieu of helping employees grow in their roles, which, when paired with an asynchronous, online-only work environment, can create a “sink or swim” culture.",

This can be isolating for new hires who do not have that shared history.\n\nShifting Goalposts: There is a lack of transparency from leadership around role definition, expectations, and success metrics. Employees who achieved or exceeded specific metrics outlined in their bonus plan still did not receive their full bonus. Management is quick to deploy performance plans in lieu of helping employees grow in their roles, which, when paired with an asynchronous, online-only work environment, can create a “sink or swim” culture.",

      "# [Pomelo Care by Pomelo Care](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/pomelo-care-raises-46-million-and-publishes-data-proving-its-virtual-care-model-improves-outcomes)\nNEW YORK, NY â June 20, 2024 â Pomelo Care, a virtual medical practice that improves maternal and newborn health outcomes, announced $46 million in Series B financing led by existing investors First Round Capital and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) Bio + Health. Pomelo will use this funding to accelerate its partnerships with payors across the country to address the root causes of the maternal health crisis.\n\nâ1 in 10 babies born in the US today start their life in a neonatal intensive care unit. US maternal morbidity and mortality rates are higher than peer countries, and the disparities in outcomes for people of color are unacceptable. Healthcare access continues to worsen, with 1 in 8 births occurring in U.S. counties with limited-to-no access to maternal care. Due to significant gaps in postpartum care, about half of pregnancy-related deaths in the U.S. occur after hospital discharge.Â\n\nThe evidence exists for how to identify people at highest risk for complications and which interventions are most effective, but existing data gaps and provider capacity challenges make it extremely difficult to apply these interventions at scale.\n\nPomelo has developed a care model that addresses these challenges by analyzing claims and health record data to proactively identify individual risk factors and providing virtual pregnancy, postpartum, and infant care to patients nationwide to reduce those risks, dramatically increasing access to high-quality, evidence-based care and improving outcomes.\n\nâIt's rare to come across an opportunity where the incentives between patient, provider and payor are all aligned,â said Josh Kopelman, Partner at First Round Capital and Pomelo board member. âMarta and the Pomelo team have found an incredible opportunity to dramatically improve outcomes for the highest risk populations, while helping payors reduce their avoidable costs.â\n\nPomelo has achieved significant milestones this year including:\n\n$46 million in financing: The company today announced $46 million in Series B financing, bringing total funding to $79 million. The Series B was led by existing investors First Round Capital and a16z. Stripes joined this round along with additional participation from existing investors SV Angel, Operator Partners and BoxGroup. They join angels and healthcare industry leaders Adam Boehler, Founder and Managing Partner of Rubicon Founders, Former Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), and Founder of Landmark Health and Puneet Singh, CEO of CareBridge.\n\nCovering over 3 million lives: Since the beginning of 2024, Pomelo has grown its covered lives with health plan partners from 2 million to over 3 million, providing care to patients in 46 states.Â\n\nPublished peer-reviewed data proving improvement in clinical outcomes: Pomelo presented new research at the 2024 ACOG Clinical & Scientific Meeting showing that Pomeloâs telemedicine care dramatically scales critical interventions that reduce the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in a Medicaid population â hypertensive disorders like preeclampsia and mental health conditions. Pomeloâs care model increased rates of evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis by 2.4x, proven to reduce preeclampsia risk by 25%, and mental health screening rates by 7x, proven to reduce perinatal depression risk by 40%. This fall, Pomelo will present data at both the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Global Congress and the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference & Exhibition showing reductions in avoidable emergency room, inpatient, and NICU utilization as a result of Pomeloâs care.\n\nâWeâve long known what works to reduce maternal and infant complications. The questions have always been: can you identify the patients who are at highest risk, can you deeply engage them in care to drive uptake of the prevention strategies we know work, and can you do it in the highest risk populations with the most limited access to care?â said Marta Bralic Kerns, Founder & CEO of Pomelo Care. âThis data demonstrates that we absolutely can. And with this additional funding, weâll have the opportunity to scale our care model to more pregnant people across the country.â\n\nâPomelo is one among a small set of health tech companies that have earned true scale,â shared Vineeta Agarwala, MD, PhD, General Partner at a16z Bio + Health and Pomelo board member. âThis scale is evident in our partnerships with major Medicaid and commercial plans covering over 3 million lives, which create the opportunity to collaborate with OB providers, labor and delivery wards, and NICUs nationwide, while serving hundreds of thousands of expecting mothers and newborns with high quality, technology-enabled care.â\n\nAbout Pomelo Care\n\nPomelo Care is a virtual medical practice that addresses underlying risk factors to improve maternal and newborn health, increase access to care and reduce avoidable costs. The company supports its patients from preconception through an infantâs first year with personalized and proactive 24/7 care from a dedicated, multispecialty team.

Stripes joined this round along with additional participation from existing investors SV Angel, Operator Partners and BoxGroup. They join angels and healthcare industry leaders Adam Boehler, Founder and Managing Partner of Rubicon Founders, Former Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), and Founder of Landmark Health and Puneet Singh, CEO of CareBridge.\n\nCovering over 3 million lives: Since the beginning of 2024, Pomelo has grown its covered lives with health plan partners from 2 million to over 3 million, providing care to patients in 46 states.\n\nPublished peer-reviewed data proving improvement in clinical outcomes: Pomelo presented new research at the 2024 ACOG Clinical & Scientific Meeting showing that Pomelo's telemedicine care dramatically scales critical interventions that reduce the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in a Medicaid population – hypertensive disorders like preeclampsia and mental health conditions. Pomelo's care model increased rates of evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis by 2.4x, proven to reduce preeclampsia risk by 25%, and mental health screening rates by 7x, proven to reduce perinatal depression risk by 40%. This fall, Pomelo will present data at both the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Global Congress and the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference & Exhibition showing reductions in avoidable emergency room, inpatient, and NICU utilization as a result of Pomelo's care.\n\n\"We've long known what works to reduce maternal and infant complications. The questions have always been: can you identify the patients who are at highest risk, can you deeply engage them in care to drive uptake of the prevention strategies we know work, and can you do it in the highest risk populations with the most limited access to care?\" said Marta Bralic Kerns, Founder & CEO of Pomelo Care. \"This data demonstrates that we absolutely can. And with this additional funding, we'll have the opportunity to scale our care model to more pregnant people across the country.\"\n\n\"Pomelo is one among a small set of health tech companies that have earned true scale,\" shared Vineeta Agarwala, MD, PhD, General Partner at a16z Bio + Health and Pomelo board member. \"This scale is evident in our partnerships with major Medicaid and commercial plans covering over 3 million lives, which create the opportunity to collaborate with OB providers, labor and delivery wards, and NICUs nationwide, while serving hundreds of thousands of expecting mothers and newborns with high quality, technology-enabled care.\"\n\nAbout Pomelo Care\n\nPomelo Care is a virtual medical practice that addresses underlying risk factors to improve maternal and newborn health, increase access to care and reduce avoidable costs.

The capital will fuel Pomeloâs continued partnership expansion with major health plans, including several Medicaid managed care organizations, employers and leading academic medical centers on the front lines of the national maternal health crisis.Â\n\nPomeloâs multispecialty team of expert clinicians cares for mothers and infants from preconception through pregnancy, birth and one year postpartum, spanning everything from prenatal care to nutrition and lactation to mental health. Its value-based virtual care model pairs each patient with a personalized care team to comprehensively address maternal health inequities and the root causes of poor outcomes. Pomelo uses data to predict and proactively identify risk, provides holistic care leveraging evidence-based protocols and novel care programs and makes 24/7 care accessible via phone, text and video.Â\n\nâWe know that the right care at the right time can dramatically improve outcomes for families. Everyone deserves access to high-quality care, regardless of their circumstances or health plan,â said Marta Bralic Kerns, founder and CEO at Pomelo Care. âThatâs why Pomelo exists â we address patient concerns right away and at home, keeping them out of the emergency room unnecessarily and lowering their risk of pregnancy, postpartum and newborn complications.âÂ\n\nSince its founding in 2021, Pomelo has achieved significant milestones, including:\n\n$33 million in capital raised: The company today announced Series A financing, which follows its 2021 Seed round. Andreessen Horowitz led both funding rounds, with additional participating investors First Round Capital (who co-led the Seed round), SV Angel, Operator Partners, Allen & Company LLC and BoxGroup, joined by angel investors and healthcare industry leaders including Adam Boehler, Managing Partner of Rubicon Founders, Former Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), and Founder of Landmark Health and Puneet Singh, Former Chief Growth Officer, Diversified Business Group at Elevance.\n\nOn track to cover two million lives this year: Pomelo currently serves patients in 44 states and partners with national payers, several of the largest Medicaid managed care organizations in the country, employers including Mount Sinai Health System and leading academic medical centers including Penn Medicine.Â\n\n> 4.9/5 average patient satisfaction: Pomelo provides 24/7 access to care with one-third of patient interactions taking place outside of traditional clinic hours and an average response time of five minutes.\n\nDespite spending $111 billion annually on maternal healthcare, the U.S. has some of the highest rates of preterm birth, NICU admissions and preventable maternal complications in the developed world. Maternal mortality worsened during the pandemic, with poor maternal and newborn outcomes remaining even more common in communities of color and rural areas. One in ten newborns start their life in the NICU and cesarean births have increased 41% over the last two decades. However, with evidence-based and accessible interventions, preterm births can be reduced by 33%, cesarean deliveries reduced by 40% and the average NICU stay reduced by at least four days.Â\n\nPomeloâs team consists of clinicians â 50% of whom are BIPOC â technologists and executives, with backgrounds at leading hospitals, academic medical centers and technology companies. The teamâs previous experience spans Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Duke University Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Flatiron Health, Kaiser Permanente, Emory University Hospital, Google and Stripe. Pomelo also announced the appointment of Vineeta Agarwala, MD, PhD, General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, and Josh Kopelman, Partner at First Round Capital, to the companyâs board of directors.Â\n\n\"Itâs inexcusable that women in the U.S. face one of the highest national mortality rates from preventable complications during pregnancy â and this statistic is only worsening year over year due to social disparities and systemic gaps in care delivery and access,â said Agarwala. âPomelo Careâs technology-driven, value-based care model completely reimagines how new families access high quality specialty care and achieve better outcomes while also reducing costs for our leading health plans, health systems and employers.âÂ\n\nTo learn more about Pomelo or to get started as a health plan or employer, please visit: https://www.pomelocare.com/Â\n\nâ\n\nAbout Pomelo Care\n\nPomelo Care is a virtual medical practice that addresses underlying risk factors to improve maternal and newborn health, increase access to care and reduce avoidable costs.

The acquisition follows Pomelo's recent $46 million Series B raise and the release of peer-reviewed data showing improvement in clinical outcomes via its personalized, proactive care model. With this acquisition, Pomelo grows its covered lives to over 15 million, including over 1 in 6 Medicaid beneficiaries nationally.\n\nPomelo Care will fully integrate The Doula Network into its care model, which consists of unlimited, virtual, round-the-clock care delivered by a dedicated team of OBGYNs and pediatricians, midwives, nurses, dietitians, therapists, and lactation experts. With the addition of The Doula Network, patients may also now be partnered with a community-based doula. This team wraps around patients' existing OB or midwife, and addresses their medical, behavioral, and social needs to improve outcomes for mother and infant.\n\nThis hybrid virtual and in-person care model is a first for maternity care. The unique combination of national scale and on-the-ground, local community support significantly expands access to high-quality maternity care in the United States for millions of women. Currently, only 6% of women in the United States receive doula care, but demand is increasing: 13 states plus Washington D.C. now require Medicaid reimbursement for doula services, 30 more states are actively taking steps toward doula reimbursement.\n\n\"Acquiring The Doula Network allows Pomelo Care to offer something never before available at scale in the United States: in-person doula support paired with unparalleled access to evidence-based, virtual care that will dramatically improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes while reducing avoidable costs,\" said Marta Bralic Kerns, founder & CEO of Pomelo Care. \"Health plans are rapidly integrating doulas into their networks to meet growing demand and they have overwhelmingly chosen The Doula Network as their partner, making them the clear market leader. This in-person, community-focused approach, coupled with our existing virtual care model, will allow us to scale dramatically, accelerate our work delivering evidence-based maternity care, and continue to address the maternity healthcare crisis in America.\"\n\nPomelo Care is working to address the national maternity care emergency in the United States. Today, 1 in 10 babies born in the U.S. are admitted to NICUs, 1 in 8 births occur in counties with low or no access to maternal care, more than a third of counties are maternity care deserts, maternal morbidity rates are higher than peer countries and there are vast, unacceptable disparities in outcomes for people of color.\n\nIn addition to providing physical, emotional, and informational support to patients, research shows doula care improves maternity outcomes and health equity, particularly among Black mothers. Compared to high-risk pregnant patients who do not receive doula care, patients under doula care during labor and delivery are 2x less likely to have a birth complication, 4x less likely to have a low-birth-weight baby, 40% less likely to have a cesarean delivery, and experience lower rates of preterm birth – improving outcomes, lowering cost, and reducing disparities.\n\nBoth Pomelo Care and The Doula Network have demonstrated data showing meaningful improvement in key measures of maternal and infant health across their patient populations.\n\nWith Pomelo's care model, data shows:\n\nIncreased rates of evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis by 2.4x, proven to reduce preeclampsia risk by 25%.\n\nIncreased completed mental health screening rates by 7x, proven to reduce perinatal depression risk by 40%.\n\nIncreased rates of follow-up care in response to a positive screen for perinatal depression by 1.7x relative to routine clinical care.\n\nAmong The Doula Network patients, data shows:\n\nA 26.3% cesarean section rate compared to the 32.4% national average.\n\nA 5.5% low birthweight rate compared to the 8.6% national average.\n\nThis month, Pomelo will present data at both the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Global Congress and the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference & Exhibition showing significant reductions in avoidable emergency room, inpatient, and NICU utilization as a result of Pomelo's care.\n\nElizabeth Simmons, MS, CD, founder and CEO of The Doula Network, who will now serve as the Head of Doula Network for Pomelo Care, shared, \"By acquiring The Doula Network, Pomelo Care is expanding desperately needed access to evidence-based maternity care and supercharging the doula ecosystem nationwide. With a worsening maternal and infant health crisis and too many women not knowing where to turn for support, this acquisition will allow us to scale our doula network and meet rapidly increasing commercial and Medicaid demand for community-based doulas.

      "# [Pomelo Care by Marta Bralic Kerns](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/a-new-model-for-maternity-care)\nThree years ago, I met a brilliant woman named Elizabeth Simmons, founder and CEO of The Doula Network, a national network of doulas providing physical, emotional, and educational support to people across the country. I had heard of her because our customers raved about The Doula Network and the outstanding community-based support they provided.Â Naturally, we had quite a lot to talk about.\n\nAs we chatted about Pomeloâs evidence-based, virtual care model, The Doula Networkâs community-based, in-person approach, and the rapidly changing landscape around health plans and doula coverage, it was clear we had a unique opportunity in front of us.Â\n\nWhich brings us to today.Â\n\nI am incredibly proud to announce that Pomelo Care has acquired The Doula Network. We are merging our models to create a first for maternity care in the United States: a national hybrid virtual and in-person care model designed to significantly expand access to high-quality maternity care.\n\nThe Unique Impact of Doulas\n\nThere is a national maternity care emergency in the United States. The statistics are appalling: 1 in 10 babies born in the US today is admitted to a NICU, 1 in 8 births occur in counties with low or no access to maternal care, more than a third of counties are maternity care deserts, maternal morbidity rates are higher than peer countries and there are vast, unacceptable disparities in outcomes for women of color.\n\nSince 2021, Pomelo has provided medical care for women during preconception, pregnancy, birth, postpartum, and for both mother and infant during their infantâs first year. The Pomelo approach consists of virtual, round-the-clock care delivered by a dedicated team of obstetric and pediatric clinicians, midwives, nurses, dietitians, therapists, and lactation experts who ensure the patient and her baby have the best possible health outcomes.Â\n\nWith the addition of The Doula Network, patients may also now be partnered with a community-based doula who will provide consequential support to patients throughout their pregnancy and postpartum period. In addition to providing in-person support, the doulas will become active members of a patientâs virtual care team, and together they will address key medical, behavioral and socialÂ factors to improve outcomes for mom, baby, and family.\n\nBut why is doula care so important?Â\n\nThere is extensive research showing doula care improves maternity outcomes and health equity, particularly among Black mothers.Â\n\nCompared to high-risk pregnant patients who do not receive doula care, patients under doula care during labor and delivery are 2 times less likely to have a birth complication, 4 times less likely to have a low-birth-weight baby, 40% less likely to have a cesarean delivery, and experience lower rates of preterm birth.Â\n\nAccording to the March of Dimes, they also experience shorter time in labor, fewer negative childbirth experiences, less anxiety and depression, and are more likely to breastfeed. And importantly, they are more likely to feel happy about the care they received.Â\n\nThe Doula Network has shown meaningful improvements in key measures of maternal and infant health across their populations, with a 19% cesarean section rate reduction compared to the national average and a 36% low birthweight rate reduction compared to the national average.Â\n\nThe simple fact is: doulas improve outcomes, lower costs, and reduce disparities. Pomelo Careâs patients will benefit greatly from their addition to our team.\n\nRapidly Growing Demand\n\nWhile the impact of doulas is clear, only 6% of women in the United States currently have coverage for doula care. Historically, health plans have not covered doula services and it has remained largely a cash-pay industry, which can cost several hundred or even several thousand dollars for patients.\n\nDoula coverage has remained limited. According to the Washington Post,Â âFor about six years starting in 2014, Minnesota and Oregon were the only states that mandated coverage of doula services through Medicaid.â\n\nBut recently, things began to change. Through the tireless work of maternal healthcare advocates and key lawmakers, 13 states plus Washington D.C. now require Medicaid reimbursement for doula services, and 30 more states are actively taking steps toward doula reimbursement.\n\nAs health plans are adapting to the new requirements and working to integrate doulas into their networks to meet growing demand, they have overwhelmingly chosen The Doula Network as their partner. Their reputation and results are unparalleled.Â\n\nAs the largest network of credentialed doulas in the United States, in-network with major commercial and Medicaid plans, The Doula Network has quickly emerged as the clear market leader.Â\n\nWith this new, integrated care model, Pomelo will significantly expand access to evidence-based maternity care across the United States, invest in the national doula ecosystem, and meet the growing commercial and Medicaid demand for community-based doulas.Â\n\nWe will also set a new standard for maternity care, where women have access to round-the-clock virtual medical care and the support they need by their side during one of the most exciting and challenging times in their lives.Â\n\nWe are now in the midst of seamlessly integrating The Doula Network into Pomelo Care and will soon begin offering in-person doula services to our patients.\n\nI am incredibly thankful to the entire Pomelo Care team for working to make this acquisition a reality. And especially grateful for the partnership of Elizabeth, who is joining Pomelo as Head of Doula Network, and The Doula Network team for joining us in our work to address the maternal healthcare crisis and bring high-quality care to every person who needs it.",

The program includes 24/7 access to text-based support groups and one-on-one coaching from a certified specialist.\n\nThe funds will expand the company's reach, partnerships and peer workforce.\n\n\"Historically, most investment in SUD care has focused on the small minority of people already receiving and open to treatment,\" Shrenik Jain, founder and CEO of Marigold Health, said in a statement.\n\n\"Generally, this treatment isn’t very effective – peer support is the unspoken reality on how most people finally get better. We’re creating a safe place for our members to empower each other and get the best out of a broken system.\"",

The $125 million Series F funding round was led by StepStone Group and included participation from existing investors General Catalyst, Sequoia, Oak HC/FT, Icon Ventures, Dragoneer Investment Group and Lux Capital. In total, Maven Clinic has raised more than $425 million. The funding brings its valuation to $1.7 billion, according to Reuters . presented by “For a decade, Maven Clinic has defied preconceptions, repeatedly proving that women’s healthcare can be intuitive, technology-first, and high-quality for every customer, from patients to employers to payers and providers,” said Seyonne Kang, partner at StepStone Group, in a statement. “We look forward to seeing Maven continue reimagining healthcare for families in the coming years.” While the company believes it’s “capable of going public,” it’s currently “laser focused on ensuring Maven can help realize the $1 trillion opportunity to boost the global economy with improved women’s healthcare,” Dr. Neel Shah, chief medical officer of Maven Clinic, told MedCity News. The funding will go towards several areas. The company will invest in its fertility benefits administration program called Maven Managed Benefit. This program offers fertility education, trying-to-conceive coaching and access to a network of more than 475 clinics. Maven Clinic will also invest in AI to make its maternity care more personalized. In addition, it will enhance its parenting and pediatrics offering and boost its midlife support, focusing on areas like chronic conditions, sexual wellness and mental health. The company will also advance its value-based partnerships with Medicaid plans and fully-insured plans. “We will double down on our commitment to ensure women and families receive the care they deserve. We will continue to introduce financial and clinical innovation into fertility benefits to ensure families have a seamless experience between physical and digital care,” Shah said. “We will continue to harness the power of large datasets to personalize care journeys and ensure our members have the same opportunities to thrive, whether they are a Medicaid recipient or an employee of a Fortune 50 company.” presented by The women’s health space has historically been underfunded . Although women represent half of the population, just 3% of digital health funding focused on women’s health between 2011 and 2020, according to Rock Health . Maven Clinic’s funding announcement is “validating” for both the women’s health sector and all of digital health, Shah declared. He added that the company’s goal looking ahead is to make sure digital health reaches its full potential. “Brick and mortar health care is essential,” Shah said. “But we all know that health is not produced within the four walls of a hospital. It’s produced in the spaces where we live our lives– in our homes, in our communities, in our workplaces. And to reach people there, outside a 15 minute clinic visit, we need the technological affordances of digital health. Our opportunity is to ensure that the potential of digital health is fully realized.” Other companies in the women’s health space include fertility clinic Kindbody, maternity care company Pomelo Care and menopause support company Evernow.

      "# [Maternal Health Scale-up Pomelo Care Goes Hybrid with Acquisition of The Doula Network by Kathrin Folkendt](https://femtechinsider.com/pomelo-care-acquires-the-doula-network/)\nPomelo Care has announced its acquisition of The Doula Network, the largest network of credentialed doulas in the United States. This acquisition positions Pomelo as the only maternity care model to offer both virtual and in-person services throughout the U.S.\n\nThe Doula Network is recognized for its substantial in-network support with major commercial and Medicaid plans. The acquisition comes at a time when states are increasingly mandating health plans to include doula care, reflecting a growing recognition of its importance in maternity care. It follows Pomelo’s recent $46 million Series B funding round and the publication of peer-reviewed data that highlights improvements in clinical outcomes through its personalized care model. With this integration, Pomelo now covers over 15 million lives, including more than 1 in 6 Medicaid beneficiaries nationally.\n\nThe Doula Network will be fully incorporated into Pomelo’s existing care model, which provides unlimited, 24/7 virtual care from a dedicated team of OBGYNs, pediatricians, midwives, nurses, dietitians, therapists, and lactation experts. Patients will now also have the option to work with a community-based doula, creating a comprehensive support system that addresses medical, behavioral, and social needs to improve outcomes for mothers and infants.\n\nThis hybrid model of care is a first for maternity services in the U.S., combining national reach with localized support to significantly enhance the quality of maternity care available to millions of women. Currently, only 6% of U.S. women receive doula care, but demand is on the rise. Thirteen states and Washington D.C. now require Medicaid reimbursement for doula services, with 30 additional states actively pursuing similar measures.\n\n“Acquiring The Doula Network allows Pomelo Care to offer something never before available at scale in the United States: in-person doula support paired with unparalleled access to evidence-based, virtual care that will dramatically improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes while reducing avoidable costs,” said Marta Bralic Kerns, founder & CEO of Pomelo Care. “Health plans are rapidly integrating doulas into their networks to meet growing demand and they have overwhelmingly chosen The Doula Network as their partner, making them the clear market leader. This in-person, community-focused approach, coupled with our existing virtual care model, will allow us to scale dramatically, accelerate our work delivering evidence-based maternity care, and continue to address the maternity healthcare crisis in America.”\n\nThe U.S. faces a maternity care crisis, with 1 in 10 babies admitted to NICUs and more than a third of counties classified as maternity care deserts. Maternal morbidity rates are concerningly high compared to peer nations, and significant disparities exist in outcomes for women of color.\n\nResearch supports the benefits of doula care, showing that it improves maternity outcomes and promotes health equity, especially for Black mothers. Compared to high-risk pregnant patients without doula support, those who receive doula care are 2x less likely to experience birth complications, 4x less likely to have low-birth-weight babies, and 40% less likely to undergo cesarean deliveries.\n\nPomelo and The Doula Network have both demonstrated significant improvements in maternal and infant health measures across their patient populations. Data reveals that Pomelo’s care model has increased rates of evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis by 2.4x and mental health screening by 7x, while The Doula Network reports a 26.3% cesarean section rate compared to the national average of 32.4%.\n\nElizabeth Simmons, MS, CD, founder and CEO of The Doula Network, will now serve as the Head of Doula Network for Pomelo Care. “By acquiring The Doula Network, Pomelo Care is expanding desperately needed access to evidence-based maternity care and supercharging the doula ecosystem nationwide. With a worsening maternal and infant health crisis and too many women not knowing where to turn for support, this acquisition will allow us to scale our doula network and meet rapidly increasing commercial and Medicaid demand for community-based doulas. I could not be more proud of the company we built and am thrilled to be joining forces with Pomelo Care to bring our high-quality doula care together with Pomelo’s personalized, evidence-based maternity care model.”",

      "# [Introducing The Future 50 by Mario Gabriele on 2024-07-16](https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/future-50-2024)\nFriends,\n\nI am extremely excited to announce the launch of Future 50, a database of the world’s highest potential startups valued at or under $200 million at the time of nomination. It’s the product of a five-month process involving the wisdom of elite venture practitioners, access to confidential information, and detailed independent research.\n\nWhen we first set out to create the Future 50, we asked ourselves a simple question: How can we ensure Generalist supporters know about the world's most promising startups before they become well-known? Our goal was to deliver genuine foresight. Simply hearing about a promising startup at the right moment can serve as an inflection point – for an investor seeking an outlier, a talented operator looking for their next challenge, or a founder seeking inspiration. We became obsessed with creating our version of an early detection system for great companies, driven by our editorial process.\n\nThe Future 50 is a benefit for premium subscribers. If you’re not a member yet and you work in tech or VC, this should justify joining. Just follow the link below.\n\nAbout the awardees\n\nIf you want to learn more about the Future 50, here are a few key details. First, this is a list that spans continents and countries. In total, awardees are headquartered in 11 different countries, to be precise. Awardees are saving mothers’ lives in America, unlocking digital payments in South Africa, buying land for reforestation in Brazil, creating AI models in India, and leveling up brand marketing in New Zealand.\n\nAs those company descriptions suggest, the Future 50 also spans sectors. There are no prizes for guessing the most common sector: AI. Other popular sectors included fintech, SaaS, crypto, and healthcare.\n\nWhat size teams do the Future 50 awardees have? On average, 58.66. The smallest team recorded has 8 people; the largest, 389.\n\nThere’s much more to learn about every awardee. Discover the AI logistics firm clocking $45 million in annual revenue, the public safety startup using drones as first responders, and the next “AWS for biology” by following the link and becoming a member.\n\nOur process\n\nThere are an infinite number of ways you might try and create a list like this one. You could collate it based on perceived status, hard metrics, personal opinion, or the opinion of ceremonial judges. We took a different approach, with a few key characteristics:\n\nCreate a valuation threshold. We started by setting a valuation threshold of $200 million, post-money, at the time of nomination. (Naturally, some companies have raised in the five months since.) It is hard enough to compare a biotech firm to a social media app – it only becomes more so when one is a seed company and the other a Series D scale-up. The $200 million threshold prioritizes companies with real traction and strong products in market, but that still have plenty of room to run, should they succeed in becoming breakout businesses.\n\nFocus on nominator quality, not quantity. We chose an outbound approach, believing it allowed us to create the highest quality list. We contacted many of the world’s best-regarded investors and asked them to nominate companies they consider the highest potential. We started with those we know and consider exceptional pickers. In turn, we asked them to nominate other investors they consider impressive. Finally, we reached out to select practitioners that have global reputations. We only considered nominations from partner-level investors. Overall, investors from nearly every Tier 1 fund participated.\n\nPush to the edges. We believe many of the most impactful companies will be built outside the United States. To ensure global coverage, we proactively sought elite venture investors from Latin America, Africa, Europe, Oceania, and Asia. As you’ll discover, the list includes many stellar organizations from beyond Silicon Valley.\n\nForce stack ranking to avoid over-nominating. As noted, we asked every investor to nominate the two companies they considered particularly high potential with an explanation for each. (Some investors ended up sharing a few more, which we considered.) Ultimately, our goal was not to solicit as many nominations as possible but to encourage nominators to make difficult choices, selecting those they consider the very best of the best. As a note, Generalist Capital is an investor in some of the companies nominated. I did not nominate any companies myself, but have noted any investment in the interest of transparency.\n\nPersonally study each company. After receiving an extremely strong cadre of nominations, I personally reviewed each one. This involved reading the investors’ rationales and studying the company directly via its website and associated press. We used this to filter the list down to a select few finalists.\n\nRequest exclusive, confirmatory information. We reached out to the finalists directly and asked them to share data confirming their valuation at the time of the nomination, cumulative capital raised, and revenue run rate. We also asked them to outline their primary sources of differentiation and highlight other traction they consider notable. Companies have allowed some of this data to be shared publicly; the rest remains confidential but was invaluable in our assessments.\n\nMake final judgments. We used the information gleaned from companies to choose our final 50. This relied on me personally reviewing all additional data supplied by the companies. In making our choice, we factored in metrics but also recognized that great companies have different commercial maturation rates.\n\nProvide detailed descriptions and clear rationales. One of our frustrations with lists is that they are often light on detail. For each awardee of the Future 50, you will find a strong synopsis of the business and why it matters. You will also find a bullet-pointed rationale explaining its inclusion: what we liked about it and why.\n\nNo process is perfect, and there are certainly trade-offs to our approach, but it’s enabled us to create something unique: a global, detailed, actionable list of potentially legendary companies – many of which I had never heard of before.\n\nWhat you can expect\n\nBy joining as a member and unlocking the full Future 50, here’s what you can expect:\n\nAn incredible list. Fifty high-potential startups, nominated by elite investors, supported by exclusive data, and curated by The Generalist.\n\nEasy-to-grasp descriptions. We explain what each company does and why it matters in clear language. You don’t need to be a sectoral expert to understand their potential.\n\nA point-by-point rationale. We give four reasons why we chose every awardee, giving you a deeper understanding of each business.\n\nTraction details. We include information on key customers, ARR, and other signs of traction whenever possible. You’ll get a sense for just how far along they are.\n\nLinks to leadership. We’ve added LinkedIn URLs that make it easy to review the people behind the businesses.\n\nHeadcount information. Virtually every awardee shared up-to-date headcount information, helping you gauge the size of their operations.\n\nAn embedded database. If you want a fast way to scan the list or filter by location or sector, you can use the Airtable we’ve created. It’s included in the Future 50 piece. Here’s a hint of what it looks like:\n\nJoin us now to unlock the full database and learn about 50 of the world’s highest-potential startups.\n\nBrought to you by Mercury\n\nIf Jony Ive built a banking* experience…\n\nIt would look a lot like Mercury. The Generalist has been a Mercury customer for years, and I’m constantly awed by the platform’s beauty, thoughtfulness, and power. It’s become a core part of how we run our business and is probably the only banking product I find a genuine pleasure to use.\n\nMercury’s banking experience isn’t just loved by The Generalist.
