Company relies heavily on asynchronous work and avoids internal meetings, which can lead to highly active Slack threads during non-business hours. Management prioritizes rapid growth over sustainable operations, and clinicians and business staff alike are spread thin. \n\nIn Group / Out Group Dynamic: The majority of the leadership team all came from the same company, and will often spend the first few minutes of all-hands meetings reminiscing about nights out doing karaoke in NYC that the majority of the company was not present for. This can be isolating for new hires who do not have that shared history.\n\nShifting Goalposts: There is a lack of transparency from leadership around role definition, expectations, and success metrics. Employees who achieved or exceeded specific metrics outlined in their bonus plan still did not receive their full bonus. Management is quick to deploy performance plans in lieu of helping employees grow in their roles, which, when paired with an asynchronous, online-only work environment, can create a “sink or swim” culture.",

This can be isolating for new hires who do not have that shared history.\n\nShifting Goalposts: There is a lack of transparency from leadership around role definition, expectations, and success metrics. Employees who achieved or exceeded specific metrics outlined in their bonus plan still did not receive their full bonus. Management is quick to deploy performance plans in lieu of helping employees grow in their roles, which, when paired with an asynchronous, online-only work environment, can create a “sink or swim” culture.",

      "# [Pomelo Care by Pomelo Care](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/pomelo-care-raises-46-million-and-publishes-data-proving-its-virtual-care-model-improves-outcomes)\nNEW YORK, NY – June 20, 2024 – Pomelo Care, a virtual medical practice that improves maternal and newborn health outcomes, announced $46 million in Series B financing led by existing investors First Round Capital and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) Bio + Health. Pomelo will use this funding to accelerate its partnerships with payors across the country to address the root causes of the maternal health crisis.\n\n‍1 in 10 babies born in the US today start their life in a neonatal intensive care unit. US maternal morbidity and mortality rates are higher than peer countries, and the disparities in outcomes for people of color are unacceptable. Healthcare access continues to worsen, with 1 in 8 births occurring in U.S. counties with limited-to-no access to maternal care. Due to significant gaps in postpartum care, about half of pregnancy-related deaths in the U.S. occur after hospital discharge.\n\nThe evidence exists for how to identify people at highest risk for complications and which interventions are most effective, but existing data gaps and provider capacity challenges make it extremely difficult to apply these interventions at scale.\n\nPomelo has developed a care model that addresses these challenges by analyzing claims and health record data to proactively identify individual risk factors and providing virtual pregnancy, postpartum, and infant care to patients nationwide to reduce those risks, dramatically increasing access to high-quality, evidence-based care and improving outcomes.\n\n“It's rare to come across an opportunity where the incentives between patient, provider and payor are all aligned,” said Josh Kopelman, Partner at First Round Capital and Pomelo board member. “Marta and the Pomelo team have found an incredible opportunity to dramatically improve outcomes for the highest risk populations, while helping payors reduce their avoidable costs.”\n\nPomelo has achieved significant milestones this year including:\n\n$46 million in financing: The company today announced $46 million in Series B financing, bringing total funding to $79 million. The Series B was led by existing investors First Round Capital and a16z. Stripes joined this round along with additional participation from existing investors SV Angel, Operator Partners and BoxGroup. They join angels and healthcare industry leaders Adam Boehler, Founder and Managing Partner of Rubicon Founders, Former Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), and Founder of Landmark Health and Puneet Singh, CEO of CareBridge.\n\nCovering over 3 million lives: Since the beginning of 2024, Pomelo has grown its covered lives with health plan partners from 2 million to over 3 million, providing care to patients in 46 states.\n\nPublished peer-reviewed data proving improvement in clinical outcomes: Pomelo presented new research at the 2024 ACOG Clinical & Scientific Meeting showing that Pomelo’s telemedicine care dramatically scales critical interventions that reduce the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in a Medicaid population – hypertensive disorders like preeclampsia and mental health conditions. Pomelo’s care model increased rates of evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis by 2.4x, proven to reduce preeclampsia risk by 25%, and mental health screening rates by 7x, proven to reduce perinatal depression risk by 40%. This fall, Pomelo will present data at both the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Global Congress and the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference & Exhibition showing reductions in avoidable emergency room, inpatient, and NICU utilization as a result of Pomelo’s care.\n\n“We’ve long known what works to reduce maternal and infant complications.

Pomelo will use this funding to accelerate its partnerships with payors across the country to address the root causes of the maternal health crisis.\n\n1 in 10 babies born in the US today start their life in a neonatal intensive care unit. US maternal morbidity and mortality rates are higher than peer countries, and the disparities in outcomes for people of color are unacceptable. Healthcare access continues to worsen, with 1 in 8 births occurring in U.S. counties with limited-to-no access to maternal care. Due to significant gaps in postpartum care, about half of pregnancy-related deaths in the U.S. occur after hospital discharge.\n\nThe evidence exists for how to identify people at highest risk for complications and which interventions are most effective, but existing data gaps and provider capacity challenges make it extremely difficult to apply these interventions at scale.\n\nPomelo has developed a care model that addresses these challenges by analyzing claims and health record data to proactively identify individual risk factors and providing virtual pregnancy, postpartum, and infant care to patients nationwide to reduce those risks, dramatically increasing access to high-quality, evidence-based care and improving outcomes.\n\n\"It's rare to come across an opportunity where the incentives between patient, provider and payor are all aligned,\" said Josh Kopelman, Partner at First Round Capital and Pomelo board member. \"Marta and the Pomelo team have found an incredible opportunity to dramatically improve outcomes for the highest risk populations, while helping payors reduce their avoidable costs.\"\n\nPomelo has achieved significant milestones this year including:\n\n$46 million in financing: The company today announced $46 million in Series B financing, bringing total funding to $79 million. The Series B was led by existing investors First Round Capital and a16z. Stripes joined this round along with additional participation from existing investors SV Angel, Operator Partners and BoxGroup. They join angels and healthcare industry leaders Adam Boehler, Founder and Managing Partner of Rubicon Founders, Former Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), and Founder of Landmark Health and Puneet Singh, CEO of CareBridge.\n\nCovering over 3 million lives: Since the beginning of 2024, Pomelo has grown its covered lives with health plan partners from 2 million to over 3 million, providing care to patients in 46 states.\n\nPublished peer-reviewed data proving improvement in clinical outcomes: Pomelo presented new research at the 2024 ACOG Clinical & Scientific Meeting showing that Pomelo's telemedicine care dramatically scales critical interventions that reduce the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in a Medicaid population – hypertensive disorders like preeclampsia and mental health conditions. Pomelo's care model increased rates of evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis by 2.4x, proven to reduce preeclampsia risk by 25%, and mental health screening rates by 7x, proven to reduce perinatal depression risk by 40%. This fall, Pomelo will present data at both the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Global Congress and the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference & Exhibition showing reductions in avoidable emergency room, inpatient, and NICU utilization as a result of Pomelo's care.\n\n\"We've long known what works to reduce maternal and infant complications.

      "# [Pomelo Care by Marta Bralic Kerns](https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/a-new-model-for-maternity-care)\nThree years ago, I met a brilliant woman named Elizabeth Simmons, founder and CEO of The Doula Network, a national network of doulas providing physical, emotional, and educational support to people across the country. I had heard of her because our customers raved about The Doula Network and the outstanding community-based support they provided. Naturally, we had quite a lot to talk about.\n\nAs we chatted about Pomelo’s evidence-based, virtual care model, The Doula Network’s community-based, in-person approach, and the rapidly changing landscape around health plans and doula coverage, it was clear we had a unique opportunity in front of us.\n\nWhich brings us to today.\n\nI am incredibly proud to announce that Pomelo Care has acquired The Doula Network. We are merging our models to create a first for maternity care in the United States: a national hybrid virtual and in-person care model designed to significantly expand access to high-quality maternity care.\n\nThe Unique Impact of Doulas\n\nThere is a national maternity care emergency in the United States. The statistics are appalling: 1 in 10 babies born in the US today is admitted to a NICU, 1 in 8 births occur in counties with low or no access to maternal care, more than a third of counties are maternity care deserts, maternal morbidity rates are higher than peer countries and there are vast, unacceptable disparities in outcomes for women of color.\n\nSince 2021, Pomelo has provided medical care for women during preconception, pregnancy, birth, postpartum, and for both mother and infant during their infant’s first year. The Pomelo approach consists of virtual, round-the-clock care delivered by a dedicated team of obstetric and pediatric clinicians, midwives, nurses, dietitians, therapists, and lactation experts who ensure the patient and her baby have the best possible health outcomes.\n\nWith the addition of The Doula Network, patients may also now be partnered with a community-based doula who will provide consequential support to patients throughout their pregnancy and postpartum period. In addition to providing in-person support, the doulas will become active members of a patient’s virtual care team, and together they will address key medical, behavioral and social factors to improve outcomes for mom, baby, and family.\n\nBut why is doula care so important?\n\nThere is extensive research showing doula care improves maternity outcomes and health equity, particularly among Black mothers.\n\nCompared to high-risk pregnant patients who do not receive doula care, patients under doula care during labor and delivery are 2 times less likely to have a birth complication, 4 times less likely to have a low-birth-weight baby, 40% less likely to have a cesarean delivery, and experience lower rates of preterm birth.\n\nAccording to the March of Dimes, they also experience shorter time in labor, fewer negative childbirth experiences, less anxiety and depression, and are more likely to breastfeed. And importantly, they are more likely to feel happy about the care they received.\n\nThe Doula Network has shown meaningful improvements in key measures of maternal and infant health across their populations, with a 19% cesarean section rate reduction compared to the national average and a 36% low birthweight rate reduction compared to the national average.\n\nThe simple fact is: doulas improve outcomes, lower costs, and reduce disparities. Pomelo Care’s patients will benefit greatly from their addition to our team.\n\nRapidly Growing Demand\n\nWhile the impact of doulas is clear, only 6% of women in the United States currently have coverage for doula care. Historically, health plans have not covered doula services and it has remained largely a cash-pay industry, which can cost several hundred or even several thousand dollars for patients.\n\nDoula coverage has remained limited. According to the Washington Post, “For about six years starting in 2014, Minnesota and Oregon were the only states that mandated coverage of doula services through Medicaid.”\n\nBut recently, things began to change. Through the tireless work of maternal healthcare advocates and key lawmakers, 13 states plus Washington D.C. now require Medicaid reimbursement for doula services, and 30 more states are actively taking steps toward doula reimbursement.\n\nAs health plans are adapting to the new requirements and working to integrate doulas into their networks to meet growing demand, they have overwhelmingly chosen The Doula Network as their partner. Their reputation and results are unparalleled.\n\nAs the largest network of credentialed doulas in the United States, in-network with major commercial and Medicaid plans, The Doula Network has quickly emerged as the clear market leader.\n\nWith this new, integrated care model, Pomelo will significantly expand access to evidence-based maternity care across the United States, invest in the national doula ecosystem, and meet the growing commercial and Medicaid demand for community-based doulas.\n\nWe will also set a new standard for maternity care, where women have access to round-the-clock virtual medical care and the support they need by their side during one of the most exciting and challenging times in their lives.\n\nWe are now in the midst of seamlessly integrating The Doula Network into Pomelo Care and will soon begin offering in-person doula services to our patients.\n\nI am incredibly thankful to the entire Pomelo Care team for working to make this acquisition a reality. And especially grateful for the partnership of Elizabeth, who is joining Pomelo as Head of Doula Network, and The Doula Network team for joining us in our work to address the maternal healthcare crisis and bring high-quality care to every person who needs it.",

The acquisition follows Pomelo's recent $46 million Series B raise and the release of peer-reviewed data showing improvement in clinical outcomes via its personalized, proactive care model. With this acquisition, Pomelo grows its covered lives to over 15 million, including over 1 in 6 Medicaid beneficiaries nationally.\n\nPomelo Care will fully integrate The Doula Network into its care model, which consists of unlimited, virtual, round-the-clock care delivered by a dedicated team of OBGYNs and pediatricians, midwives, nurses, dietitians, therapists, and lactation experts. With the addition of The Doula Network, patients may also now be partnered with a community-based doula. This team wraps around patients' existing OB or midwife, and addresses their medical, behavioral, and social needs to improve outcomes for mother and infant.\n\nThis hybrid virtual and in-person care model is a first for maternity care. The unique combination of national scale and on-the-ground, local community support significantly expands access to high-quality maternity care in the United States for millions of women. Currently, only 6% of women in the United States receive doula care, but demand is increasing: 13 states plus Washington D.C. now require Medicaid reimbursement for doula services, 30 more states are actively taking steps toward doula reimbursement.\n\n\"Acquiring The Doula Network allows Pomelo Care to offer something never before available at scale in the United States: in-person doula support paired with unparalleled access to evidence-based, virtual care that will dramatically improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes while reducing avoidable costs,\" said Marta Bralic Kerns, founder & CEO of Pomelo Care. \"Health plans are rapidly integrating doulas into their networks to meet growing demand and they have overwhelmingly chosen The Doula Network as their partner, making them the clear market leader.

Compared to high-risk pregnant patients who do not receive doula care, patients under doula care during labor and delivery are 2x less likely to have a birth complication, 4x less likely to have a low-birth-weight baby, 40% less likely to have a cesarean delivery, and experience lower rates of preterm birth – improving outcomes, lowering cost, and reducing disparities.\n\nBoth Pomelo Care and The Doula Network have demonstrated data showing meaningful improvement in key measures of maternal and infant health across their patient populations.\n\nWith Pomelo's care model, data shows:\n\nIncreased rates of evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis by 2.4x, proven to reduce preeclampsia risk by 25%.\n\nIncreased completed mental health screening rates by 7x, proven to reduce perinatal depression risk by 40%.\n\nIncreased rates of follow-up care in response to a positive screen for perinatal depression by 1.7x relative to routine clinical care.\n\nAmong The Doula Network patients, data shows:\n\nA 26.3% cesarean section rate compared to the 32.4% national average.\n\nA 5.5% low birthweight rate compared to the 8.6% national average.\n\nThis month, Pomelo will present data at both the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Global Congress and the American Academy of Pediatrics National Conference & Exhibition showing significant reductions in avoidable emergency room, inpatient, and NICU utilization as a result of Pomelo's care.\n\nElizabeth Simmons, MS, CD, founder and CEO of The Doula Network, who will now serve as the Head of Doula Network for Pomelo Care, shared, \"By acquiring The Doula Network, Pomelo Care is expanding desperately needed access to evidence-based maternity care and supercharging the doula ecosystem nationwide. With a worsening maternal and infant health crisis and too many women not knowing where to turn for support, this acquisition will allow us to scale our doula network and meet rapidly increasing commercial and Medicaid demand for community-based doulas.

Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity in the U.S., affecting 1 in 7 hospital deliveries. Mental health conditions are the leading underlying cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the US. However, fewer than 20% of women self-report symptoms of perinatal depression, highlighting an opportunity for better mental health screening to identify symptoms and initiate treatment to improve outcomes.\n\nExisting clinical interventions are proven to reduce the risk of preeclampsia by 25% and perinatal depression risk by 40%. Despite these known interventions, patients continue to develop these conditions at alarming rates due to limited and worsening access to maternal care and low rates of these evidence-based interventions, particularly among Medicaid patients. The most recent HEDIS data indicates that only 8.8% of Medicaid patients are screened prenatally for depression. And just 25% or less of pregnant patients with an elevated risk of developing preeclampsia initiate aspirin prophylaxis to reduce preeclampsia risk.\n\nNew data from Pomelo demonstrates that its virtual care program effectively scales data-backed interventions to address both preeclampsia and PMAD risk among a Medicaid population.

Findings from four independent studies demonstrate that Pomelo's approach reduces total care costs in a Medicaid population, lowers NICU and ER utilization for both mothers and infants, and enhances follow-up care for depression.\n\nIn November, Pomelo presented data at the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Europe conference that evaluated the cost impact of Pomelo Care's 24/7 virtual maternal-newborn care program on population-level total cost of care in a Medicaid population. The results demonstrate that engagement in Pomelo Care's virtual maternity program is associated with a 15% reduction in the cost of care across a Medicaid population, demonstrating a 2.3:1 ROI relative to Pomelo's fees. Additionally, the findings suggest that telemedicine can be a cost-effective mechanism to augment perinatal care.\n\nIn September, the Pomelo presented peer-reviewed data at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's (SMFM) Global Congress in Rome that compared perinatal risk and healthcare utilization between patients who engaged prenatally in Pomelo Care's 24/7 virtual maternity care program and those who did not. The data showed that Pomelo's model led to a 46% reduction in emergency department utilization, a 58% reduction in NICU admissions, and an 11% reduction in non-birth inpatient stays.\n\nAlso, in September, Pomelo presented data at the American Academy of Pediatrics conference in Orlando that examined the effect of Pomelo Care's program on the frequency of infant emergency department visits during the first 60 days of life. Infants whose parents engaged meaningfully with a telemedicine program designed to provide support in the postpartum period were less likely to have an emergency department visit in the 60 days after birth, despite having higher medical risk. The data showed a 23% reduction in the rate of infant emergency department visits within 60 days of birth for the Pomelo versus non-Pomelo populations in the study.\n\nThe results of this study highlight the potential of virtual perinatal programs to increase access to care and reduce avoidable emergency department visits. These results are particularly important for Medicaid-enrolled infants, a population often faced with significant healthcare access challenges.\n\nThis July, at the Postpartum Support International conference in Washington, DC, Pomelo published data on perinatal depression, which encompasses both major and minor depressive episodes during pregnancy and in the 12 months after birth. This is a common and major area of concern for patients, clinicians, and payers. Unfortunately, the national average for follow-up rates on positive prenatal and postpartum screens in Medicaid remain suboptimal at 53% and 63%.\n\nHowever, engagement in Pomelo Care's virtual maternity program is associated with a 1.7x increase in follow-up rates for positive perinatal depression screenings. This demonstrates the effectiveness of virtual care interventions for screening and follow up on positive perinatal depression screenings, signaling potential for virtual care interventions to impact mental health, one of the biggest drivers of maternal health outcomes.\n\n\"This data underscores the significant impact Pomelo Care's virtual maternal health care model is having on both clinical outcomes and total cost of care for underserved patients,\" said Marta Bralic Kerns, Founder & CEO of Pomelo Care. \"By leveraging telemedicine to engage Medicaid-enrolled mothers and infants in ongoing comprehensive, evidence-based care, we are not only reducing avoidable NICU and ER visits but also significantly increasing access to critical follow-up care for mental health, which is a key driver of long-term health outcomes. This data highlights the value of telemedicine in transforming maternal and infant care, making it more accessible, equitable, and impactful.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Pomelo presented research at the 2024 ACOG Clinical & Scientific Meeting showing that Pomelo's virtual care model dramatically scales critical interventions that reduce the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in a Medicaid population – hypertensive disorders like preeclampsia and mental health conditions. Pomelo's care model increased rates of evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis by 2.4x, proven to reduce preeclampsia risk by 25%, and mental health screening rates by 7x, proven to reduce perinatal depression risk by 40%.\n\nAbout Pomelo Care\n\nPomelo Care is the national leader in evidence-based maternity care.

      "# [Maternal Health Scale-up Pomelo Care Goes Hybrid with Acquisition of The Doula Network by Kathrin Folkendt](https://femtechinsider.com/pomelo-care-acquires-the-doula-network/)\nPomelo Care has announced its acquisition of The Doula Network, the largest network of credentialed doulas in the United States. This acquisition positions Pomelo as the only maternity care model to offer both virtual and in-person services throughout the U.S.\n\nThe Doula Network is recognized for its substantial in-network support with major commercial and Medicaid plans. The acquisition comes at a time when states are increasingly mandating health plans to include doula care, reflecting a growing recognition of its importance in maternity care. It follows Pomelo’s recent $46 million Series B funding round and the publication of peer-reviewed data that highlights improvements in clinical outcomes through its personalized care model. With this integration, Pomelo now covers over 15 million lives, including more than 1 in 6 Medicaid beneficiaries nationally.\n\nThe Doula Network will be fully incorporated into Pomelo’s existing care model, which provides unlimited, 24/7 virtual care from a dedicated team of OBGYNs, pediatricians, midwives, nurses, dietitians, therapists, and lactation experts. Patients will now also have the option to work with a community-based doula, creating a comprehensive support system that addresses medical, behavioral, and social needs to improve outcomes for mothers and infants.\n\nThis hybrid model of care is a first for maternity services in the U.S., combining national reach with localized support to significantly enhance the quality of maternity care available to millions of women. Currently, only 6% of U.S. women receive doula care, but demand is on the rise. Thirteen states and Washington D.C. now require Medicaid reimbursement for doula services, with 30 additional states actively pursuing similar measures.\n\n“Acquiring The Doula Network allows Pomelo Care to offer something never before available at scale in the United States: in-person doula support paired with unparalleled access to evidence-based, virtual care that will dramatically improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes while reducing avoidable costs,” said Marta Bralic Kerns, founder & CEO of Pomelo Care. “Health plans are rapidly integrating doulas into their networks to meet growing demand and they have overwhelmingly chosen The Doula Network as their partner, making them the clear market leader. This in-person, community-focused approach, coupled with our existing virtual care model, will allow us to scale dramatically, accelerate our work delivering evidence-based maternity care, and continue to address the maternity healthcare crisis in America.”\n\nThe U.S. faces a maternity care crisis, with 1 in 10 babies admitted to NICUs and more than a third of counties classified as maternity care deserts. Maternal morbidity rates are concerningly high compared to peer nations, and significant disparities exist in outcomes for women of color.\n\nResearch supports the benefits of doula care, showing that it improves maternity outcomes and promotes health equity, especially for Black mothers. Compared to high-risk pregnant patients without doula support, those who receive doula care are 2x less likely to experience birth complications, 4x less likely to have low-birth-weight babies, and 40% less likely to undergo cesarean deliveries.\n\nPomelo and The Doula Network have both demonstrated significant improvements in maternal and infant health measures across their patient populations. Data reveals that Pomelo’s care model has increased rates of evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis by 2.4x and mental health screening by 7x, while The Doula Network reports a 26.3% cesarean section rate compared to the national average of 32.4%.\n\nElizabeth Simmons, MS, CD, founder and CEO of The Doula Network, will now serve as the Head of Doula Network for Pomelo Care. “By acquiring The Doula Network, Pomelo Care is expanding desperately needed access to evidence-based maternity care and supercharging the doula ecosystem nationwide. With a worsening maternal and infant health crisis and too many women not knowing where to turn for support, this acquisition will allow us to scale our doula network and meet rapidly increasing commercial and Medicaid demand for community-based doulas. I could not be more proud of the company we built and am thrilled to be joining forces with Pomelo Care to bring our high-quality doula care together with Pomelo’s personalized, evidence-based maternity care model.”",

New York City-based Maven Clinic offers support for fertility, maternity, parenting, menopause and other areas. It works with more than 2,000 health plans and employers across 175 countries, including Amazon, Microsoft and AT&T. The $125 million Series F funding round was led by StepStone Group and included participation from existing investors General Catalyst, Sequoia, Oak HC/FT, Icon Ventures, Dragoneer Investment Group and Lux Capital. In total, Maven Clinic has raised more than $425 million. The funding brings its valuation to $1.7 billion, according to Reuters . presented by “For a decade, Maven Clinic has defied preconceptions, repeatedly proving that women’s healthcare can be intuitive, technology-first, and high-quality for every customer, from patients to employers to payers and providers,” said Seyonne Kang, partner at StepStone Group, in a statement. “We look forward to seeing Maven continue reimagining healthcare for families in the coming years.” While the company believes it’s “capable of going public,” it’s currently “laser focused on ensuring Maven can help realize the $1 trillion opportunity to boost the global economy with improved women’s healthcare,” Dr. Neel Shah, chief medical officer of Maven Clinic, told MedCity News. The funding will go towards several areas. The company will invest in its fertility benefits administration program called Maven Managed Benefit. This program offers fertility education, trying-to-conceive coaching and access to a network of more than 475 clinics. Maven Clinic will also invest in AI to make its maternity care more personalized.

The company will also advance its value-based partnerships with Medicaid plans and fully-insured plans. “We will double down on our commitment to ensure women and families receive the care they deserve. We will continue to introduce financial and clinical innovation into fertility benefits to ensure families have a seamless experience between physical and digital care,” Shah said. “We will continue to harness the power of large datasets to personalize care journeys and ensure our members have the same opportunities to thrive, whether they are a Medicaid recipient or an employee of a Fortune 50 company.” presented by The women’s health space has historically been underfunded . Although women represent half of the population, just 3% of digital health funding focused on women’s health between 2011 and 2020, according to Rock Health . Maven Clinic’s funding announcement is “validating” for both the women’s health sector and all of digital health, Shah declared. He added that the company’s goal looking ahead is to make sure digital health reaches its full potential. “Brick and mortar health care is essential,” Shah said. “But we all know that health is not produced within the four walls of a hospital. It’s produced in the spaces where we live our lives– in our homes, in our communities, in our workplaces. And to reach people there, outside a 15 minute clinic visit, we need the technological affordances of digital health. Our opportunity is to ensure that the potential of digital health is fully realized.” Other companies in the women’s health space include fertility clinic Kindbody, maternity care company Pomelo Care and menopause support company Evernow.

      "# [Introducing The Future 50 by Mario Gabriele on 2024-07-16](https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/future-50-2024)\nFriends,\n\nI am extremely excited to announce the launch of Future 50, a database of the world’s highest potential startups valued at or under $200 million at the time of nomination. It’s the product of a five-month process involving the wisdom of elite venture practitioners, access to confidential information, and detailed independent research.\n\nWhen we first set out to create the Future 50, we asked ourselves a simple question: How can we ensure Generalist supporters know about the world's most promising startups before they become well-known? Our goal was to deliver genuine foresight. Simply hearing about a promising startup at the right moment can serve as an inflection point – for an investor seeking an outlier, a talented operator looking for their next challenge, or a founder seeking inspiration. We became obsessed with creating our version of an early detection system for great companies, driven by our editorial process.\n\nThe Future 50 is a benefit for premium subscribers. If you’re not a member yet and you work in tech or VC, this should justify joining. Just follow the link below.\n\nAbout the awardees\n\nIf you want to learn more about the Future 50, here are a few key details. First, this is a list that spans continents and countries. In total, awardees are headquartered in 11 different countries, to be precise. Awardees are saving mothers’ lives in America, unlocking digital payments in South Africa, buying land for reforestation in Brazil, creating AI models in India, and leveling up brand marketing in New Zealand.\n\nAs those company descriptions suggest, the Future 50 also spans sectors. There are no prizes for guessing the most common sector: AI. Other popular sectors included fintech, SaaS, crypto, and healthcare.\n\nWhat size teams do the Future 50 awardees have? On average, 58.66. The smallest team recorded has 8 people; the largest, 389.\n\nThere’s much more to learn about every awardee. Discover the AI logistics firm clocking $45 million in annual revenue, the public safety startup using drones as first responders, and the next “AWS for biology” by following the link and becoming a member.\n\nOur process\n\nThere are an infinite number of ways you might try and create a list like this one. You could collate it based on perceived status, hard metrics, personal opinion, or the opinion of ceremonial judges. We took a different approach, with a few key characteristics:\n\nCreate a valuation threshold. We started by setting a valuation threshold of $200 million, post-money, at the time of nomination. (Naturally, some companies have raised in the five months since.) It is hard enough to compare a biotech firm to a social media app – it only becomes more so when one is a seed company and the other a Series D scale-up. The $200 million threshold prioritizes companies with real traction and strong products in market, but that still have plenty of room to run, should they succeed in becoming breakout businesses.\n\nFocus on nominator quality, not quantity. We chose an outbound approach, believing it allowed us to create the highest quality list. We contacted many of the world’s best-regarded investors and asked them to nominate companies they consider the highest potential. We started with those we know and consider exceptional pickers. In turn, we asked them to nominate other investors they consider impressive. Finally, we reached out to select practitioners that have global reputations. We only considered nominations from partner-level investors. Overall, investors from nearly every Tier 1 fund participated.\n\nPush to the edges. We believe many of the most impactful companies will be built outside the United States. To ensure global coverage, we proactively sought elite venture investors from Latin America, Africa, Europe, Oceania, and Asia. As you’ll discover, the list includes many stellar organizations from beyond Silicon Valley.\n\nForce stack ranking to avoid over-nominating. As noted, we asked every investor to nominate the two companies they considered particularly high potential with an explanation for each. (Some investors ended up sharing a few more, which we considered.) Ultimately, our goal was not to solicit as many nominations as possible but to encourage nominators to make difficult choices, selecting those they consider the very best of the best. As a note, Generalist Capital is an investor in some of the companies nominated. I did not nominate any companies myself, but have noted any investment in the interest of transparency.\n\nPersonally study each company. After receiving an extremely strong cadre of nominations, I personally reviewed each one. This involved reading the investors’ rationales and studying the company directly via its website and associated press. We used this to filter the list down to a select few finalists.\n\nRequest exclusive, confirmatory information. We reached out to the finalists directly and asked them to share data confirming their valuation at the time of the nomination, cumulative capital raised, and revenue run rate. We also asked them to outline their primary sources of differentiation and highlight other traction they consider notable. Companies have allowed some of this data to be shared publicly; the rest remains confidential but was invaluable in our assessments.\n\nMake final judgments. We used the information gleaned from companies to choose our final 50. This relied on me personally reviewing all additional data supplied by the companies. In making our choice, we factored in metrics but also recognized that great companies have different commercial maturation rates.\n\nProvide detailed descriptions and clear rationales. One of our frustrations with lists is that they are often light on detail. For each awardee of the Future 50, you will find a strong synopsis of the business and why it matters. You will also find a bullet-pointed rationale explaining its inclusion: what we liked about it and why.\n\nNo process is perfect, and there are certainly trade-offs to our approach, but it’s enabled us to create something unique: a global, detailed, actionable list of potentially legendary companies – many of which I had never heard of before.\n\nWhat you can expect\n\nBy joining as a member and unlocking the full Future 50, here’s what you can expect:\n\nAn incredible list. Fifty high-potential startups, nominated by elite investors, supported by exclusive data, and curated by The Generalist.\n\nEasy-to-grasp descriptions. We explain what each company does and why it matters in clear language. You don’t need to be a sectoral expert to understand their potential.\n\nA point-by-point rationale. We give four reasons why we chose every awardee, giving you a deeper understanding of each business.\n\nTraction details. We include information on key customers, ARR, and other signs of traction whenever possible. You’ll get a sense for just how far along they are.\n\nLinks to leadership. We’ve added LinkedIn URLs that make it easy to review the people behind the businesses.\n\nHeadcount information. Virtually every awardee shared up-to-date headcount information, helping you gauge the size of their operations.\n\nAn embedded database. If you want a fast way to scan the list or filter by location or sector, you can use the Airtable we’ve created. It’s included in the Future 50 piece. Here’s a hint of what it looks like:\n\nJoin us now to unlock the full database and learn about 50 of the world’s highest-potential startups.\n\nBrought to you by Mercury\n\nIf Jony Ive built a banking* experience…\n\nIt would look a lot like Mercury.
