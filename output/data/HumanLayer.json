      "# [Response Webhooks](https://www.humanlayer.dev/docs/core/response-webhooks)\nResponse Webhooks are a way to receive notifications when an approval is requested or completed.\n\nThis is an advanced feature that requires a bit of setup on your end. If you’re interested in getting started quickly, we recommend using one of the following methods instead:\n\nApproval Decorator\n\nfetch approval\n\nfetch response\n\nOverview\n\nUsing response webhooks generally involves a few steps:\n\nChoose a way you’ll uniquely identify the operation\n\nCreate an operation\n\nStore your agent’s workflow state\n\nCreate a webhook endpoint\n\nConfigure webhook in HumanLayer\n\nHandle webhook responses\n\nYou can find a complete working example in our FastAPI Webhooks Example.\n\n1. Choose an Operation Identifier\n\nFirst, decide how you’ll uniquely identify each operation in your system. You have several options:\n\nUse a server-generated call_id\n\nUse an external identifier (like OpenAI’s tool_call_id)\n\nCreate your own custom identifier system\n\n2. Create the Operation\n\nUse the appropriate creation endpoint based on your needs:\n\n3. Store Operation State\n\nStore your agent’s workflow state so you can resume it when the webhook arrives. Common approaches include:\n\nDictionary Storage\n\nDatabase Storage\n\nUsing HumanLayer to store your state\n\nWhen making function calls or human contacts, you can include a state object that will be preserved and returned in webhooks. This allows your application to be stateless while maintaining context across the request lifecycle.\n\nExample:\n\nWhen the webhook arrives, the state will be returned in the webhook payload, allowing you to restore the conversation context.\n\nFor a complete example of using state preservation with webhooks, see the FastAPI Email Example which demonstrates maintaining conversation state across multiple email interactions.\n\n4. Create Webhook Endpoint\n\nCreate an endpoint in your application to receive webhook notifications:\n\nSet up an endpoint on your server that will:\n\nReceive POST requests from HumanLayer\n\nValidate webhook signatures\n\nProcess the incoming webhook data\n\nWebhooks will be sent with the fully completed FunctionCall or HumanContact object, which will include the call_id you set during creation, as well as the resolved response in status, and any state you set in the spec.\n\n5. Configure Webhook in Dashboard\n\nIn the HumanLayer Dashboard:\n\nNavigate to Response Webhooks\n\nCreate a new endpoint with your URL\n\nSubscribe to relevant events:\n\nfunction_call.completed\n\nhuman_contact.completed\n\n6. Approve the request\n\nApprove the request using any of the supported channels in HumanLayer, e.g. the web app, slack, email, etc.\n\n7. Handle the payload\n\nThe approval should trigger a webhook to your endpoint, which will include the fully completed FunctionCall or HumanContact object.\n\nComplete Example\n\nFor a complete working example including ngrok setup for local development, see our FastAPI Webhooks Example.\n\nThe example demonstrates:",
      "# [Agent Webhooks](https://www.humanlayer.dev/docs/core/agent-webhooks)\nAgent webhooks are designed to allow you to launch an agent in response to a message from a platform like email, slack, etc.\n\nNot to be confused with webhooks, which allows you to receive a notification when an approval or human contact is completed, Agent webhooks are specifically designed for kicking off new tasks and workflows. They use the same webhook console in the HumanLayer dashboard, with an event type of v1beta2.agent_email.received.\n\nUse cases\n\nAgent webhooks are useful for:\n\nForwarding an email to an agent to handle\n\nLaunching an agent workflow in response to a message in Slack\n\nYou can see examples of using agent webhooks in:\n\nMailcrew - an open source agent that uses HumanLayer to receive and respond to inbound emails\n\nFastAPI Email Example - a complete example of handling inbound emails with FastAPI\n\nOverview\n\nTo get started with agent webhooks, you’ll need to:\n\nImplement an AI Agent in your language and/or framework of choice, and create an API endpoint that can launch the agent\n\nCreate a publicly reachable URL that can receive webhooks from HumanLayer (we recommend ngrok to catch webhooks while you’re developing locally)\n\nCreate a new agent webhook in the HumanLayer dashboard\n\nConfigure your webhook endpoint to receive events with the v1beta2.agent_email.received event type in the Response Webhooks section of the HumanLayer dashboard\n\nTest the webhook by sending an email to the webhook email address\n\nEmail Payload\n\nThe webhook payload models are defined in models_agent_webhook.py.\n\nFor email webhooks, the payload will have the following structure:\n\na JSON example might look like\n\nState Preservation\n\nWhen making function calls or human contacts, you can include a state object that will be preserved and returned in webhooks.

      "# [Human as Tool](https://www.humanlayer.dev/docs/core/human-as-tool)\nThe Basic Usage method is the easiest way to create a human contact tool\n\nThe Fetch Response method is useful if you want more control over the response handling\n\nThe Creating / Fetching method gives you full control over the contact flow\n\nSee Advanced Usage for concepts like response options and contact channels\n\nStructure\n\nHuman contact tools are built on the Human Contact API.\n\nMethods\n\nThere are three main jobs-to-be-done that you can control when using human contact tools:\n\nCreating the contact request\n\nHalting execution until the human responds\n\nPassing the response back to the LLM\n\nIn all cases, the HumanLayer SDK handles finding the right human and collecting their response.\n\nBasic Usage\n\nYou can use the human_as_tool method to create a tool that an LLM can use to contact a human.\n\nThe method returns a native python function that can be used as a tool in any LLM framework that supports inferring tool structure from the function signature, docstring, and type hints.\n\nBy default, the tool will use the default contact channel for the project associated with your HUMANLAYER_API_KEY.\n\nYou may want to give your LLM access to multiple humans as tools. This example uses a Slack Contact Channel, but you can use any of the Contact Channels supported by HumanLayer.\n\nIn this case, the HumanLayer SDK handles:\n\nCreating the contact request\n\nHalting execution until the human responds\n\nPassing the response back to the LLM\n\nExample\n\nSee 04-human_as_tool_linkedin.py for a full example.\n\nFetch Response\n\nYou can use the fetch_human_response method to halt execution until the human responds, and receive a result that you can use to decide what to do next.\n\nIn this case, the HumanLayer SDK handles:\n\nCreating the contact request\n\nHalting execution until the human responds\n\nAnd your code is responsible for:\n\nHandling the human’s response\n\nCreating and Fetching\n\nFor maximum control over the contact flow, you can create and fetch responses separately. This is useful if you want to implement your own waiting logic or integrate with a custom event loop.\n\nIn this case, the HumanLayer SDK handles:\n\nCreating the contact request\n\nFetching the response status\n\nAnd your code is responsible for:\n\nHalting execution until the human responds\n\nHandling the response\n\nAdvanced Usage\n\nResponse Options\n\nYou can provide structured response options to guide the human’s response:\n\nHumanLayer supports multiple contact channels:\n\nSlack (SlackContactChannel)\n\nEmail (EmailContactChannel)\n\nSMS (SMSContactChannel)\n\nWhatsApp (WhatsAppContactChannel)",

This tool allows AI workflows to pause at designated points—say, before finalizing a payment or dropping a database table—and generate customizable review interfaces. Human reviewers can then asynchronously examine the AI’s outputs, edit them if necessary, and either approve or reject them. For example, imagine an automated system drafting a blog post or processing a transaction: the goto\\_human plugin can create a tailored review page where a person verifies the content or details, ensuring everything aligns with expectations. \n\nOnce the review is complete, webhooks relay the decision back to the system, enabling it to proceed seamlessly. This asynchronous approach keeps the workflow efficient while embedding human expertise exactly where it’s needed. \n\nWithin Dify.AI’s ecosystem, such tools make it straightforward to build in these oversight points, balancing automation with quality control in critical operations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ougwddcmmle1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fd0d8da9a2efccd091aa1778df91dc13cc53bd1\n\n## Comment ID mfexw2m with +2 score by [(lightaime, Reddit, 2025-03-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1iw0rus/human_in_the_loop_for_ai_agents/mfexw2m/) (in reply to ID 1iw0rus):\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hgul3aon92me1.jpeg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bbbc2033121fa40bf8e32c33b990c72a413212e8\n\nThis blog is a good reading material for agents with human in the loop: [https://www.camel-ai.org/blogs/human-in-the-loop-ai-camel-integration](https://www.camel-ai.org/blogs/human-in-the-loop-ai-camel-integration).

For example, let's say I have a`send_email`tool, and I'd like to confirm before it is run.\n\nDoes the Langchain agent framework provide a way to hook into the lifecycle in order to do this? Ideally, a hook that would run before the invocation, has tool name and arguments passed in, and then you can return True or False (or an \\*Exception for an error). I could have the email displayed to standard out there, and collect input. \n\nIt doesn't seem like callback handlers work, and they weren't intended for that anyway. They are for introspection (like logging, instrumentation, etc.).\n\nI can actually put the confirmation logic in the tool function itself and get it to work, but that doesn't seem right. I could create a special wrapper function \"add\\_human\\_approval(tool\\_func)\" that returns a new function that asks for human approval, and if it passes invokes the passed in func, otherwise returns. Again, that's still at the tool level, instead as part of the lifecycle.\n\nThoughts?\n\n\n\n \n\n## Comment ID l27p1j6 with +2 score by [(XhoniShollaj, Reddit, 2024-05-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1ci3m0k/toolcalling_agents_human_approval_before_tool/l27p1j6/) (in reply to ID 1ci3m0k):\nYou can take a look at the following example in LangGraph: [https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/main/examples/agent\\_executor/human-in-the-loop.ipynb](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/main/examples/agent_executor/human-in-the-loop.ipynb)\n\n### Comment ID l28k4un with +1 score by [(transwarpconduit1, Reddit, 2024-05-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1ci3m0k/toolcalling_agents_human_approval_before_tool/l28k4un/) (in reply to ID l27p1j6):\nThank you!

Just thought I could share this. \n\n## Comment ID lvkfdpv with +32 score by [(deletemorecode, Reddit, 2024-11-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1gkdzpm/f24_had_35_ai_companies_out_of_55/lvkfdpv/) (in reply to ID 1gkdzpm):\nNeural nets are so hot rn\n\n### Comment ID lvkga2i with +7 score by [(biricat, Reddit, 2024-11-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1gkdzpm/f24_had_35_ai_companies_out_of_55/lvkga2i/) (in reply to ID lvkfdpv):\nYes but it seems they are still open to non AI.\n\n#### Comment ID lvnxo16 with +1 score by [(Born_Cash_4210, Reddit, 2024-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1gkdzpm/f24_had_35_ai_companies_out_of_55/lvnxo16/) (in reply to ID lvkga2i):\nDo u have a list of all 55 companies\n\n### Comment ID lvmzk2p with +2 score by [(Adorable_Pair_5398, Reddit, 2024-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1gkdzpm/f24_had_35_ai_companies_out_of_55/lvmzk2p/) (in reply to ID lvkfdpv):\nplease tell me more!

But I guess VCs like that so who can blame YC.\n\n### Comment ID lvljrkk with +8 score by [(idgaflolol, Reddit, 2024-11-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1gkdzpm/f24_had_35_ai_companies_out_of_55/lvljrkk/) (in reply to ID lvl5xj4):\nFor many companies, YC is betting on the founder(s) more than the specific company they’re running when they apply.\n\n#### Comment ID lvm0zw0 with +24 score by [(Just-Opportunity9805, Reddit, 2024-11-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1gkdzpm/f24_had_35_ai_companies_out_of_55/lvm0zw0/) (in reply to ID lvljrkk):\nYep, they bet on founders whose genius can be seen in the truly unique gpt wrappers they create.

Before this, Decagon became a unicorn and Regal AI raised a huge round. Existing players such as Intercom, Zendesk, Salesforce, Hubspot are also coming up with their AI agents.\n\nI thought the customer support SaaS space was already oversaturated before this. I know that these agentic systems are supposed to replace human support agents, so the market might be larger, but is it that large? Can the market support all these high valuations? I can't make this make sense.\n\n### Comment ID lvlk340 with +3 score by [(idgaflolol, Reddit, 2024-11-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1gkdzpm/f24_had_35_ai_companies_out_of_55/lvlk340/) (in reply to ID lvlae64):\nI think we’ll see OpenAI/Anthropics of the world morph more into product-oriented companies, as the model itself isn’t a strong enough moat. custom supporter is a prime use case I could see them going after.\n\n### Comment ID lvmnq8b with +2 score by [(Spirited_Ad4194, Reddit, 2024-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1gkdzpm/f24_had_35_ai_companies_out_of_55/lvmnq8b/) (in reply to ID lvlae64):\nEventually these companies will get accquired by one of the large foundation model providers to create a product ecosystem.

      "# [Launch HN: Human Layer (YC F24) – Human-in-the-Loop API for AI Systems](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42247368)\nHey HN! I'm Dex, building HumanLayer (https://humanlayer.dev), an API that lets AI agents contact humans for feedback, input, and approvals. We enable safe deployment of autonomous/headless AI systems in production. You can try it with our Python or TypeScript SDKs and start using it immediately with a free trial. We have a free tier and transparent usage-based pricing. Here’s a demo: https://youtu.be/5sbN8rh_S5Q?t=51\n\nWhat's really exciting is that we're enabling teams to deploy AI systems that would otherwise be too risky. We let you focus on building powerful agents while knowing that critical steps will always get a human-in-the-loop. It's been dope seeing people start to think bigger when they consider dynamic human oversight as a key ingredient in production AI systems.\n\nThis started when we were building AI agents for data teams. We wanted to automate tedious tasks like dropping unused tables, but customers were (rightfully!) opposed to giving AI agents direct access to production systems.\n\nGetting AI to \"production grade\" reliability is a function of \"how risky is this task the AI is performing\". We didn't have the 3+ months it would have taken to sink into evals, fine tuning, and prompt engineering to get to a point where the agent had 99.9+% reliability—and even then, getting decision makers comfortable with flipping the switch on was a challenge. So instead we built some basic approval flows, like \"ask in Slack before dropping tables\".\n\nBut this communication itself needed guardrails—what if the agent contacted the wrong person? How would the head of data look if a tool he bought sent a nagging Slack message to the CEO? Our buyers wanted the agent to ask stakeholders for approval, but first they wanted to approve the \"ask for approval\" action itself. And then I started thinking about it... as a product builder + owner, I wanted to approve the \"ask for approval to ask for approval\" action!\n\nI hacked together a human-AI interaction that would handle each of these cases across both my and my customers' Slack instances. By this time, I was convinced that any team building AI agents would need this kind of infrastructure and decided to build it as a standalone product. I presented the MVP at an AI meetup in SF and had a ton of incredible conversations, and went all in on building HumanLayer.\n\nWhen you integrate the HumanLayer SDK, your AI agent can request human approval at any point in its execution. We handle all the complexity of routing these requests to the right people through their preferred channels (Slack or email, SMS and Teams coming soon), managing state while waiting for responses, and providing a complete audit trail. In addition to \"ask for approval\", we also support a more generic \"human as tool\" function that can be exposed to an LLM or agent framework, and will handle collecting a human response to a generic question like \"I'm stuck on $PROBLEM, I've tried $THINGS, please advise\" (I get messages like this sometimes from in-house agents we rolled out for back-office automations).\n\nBecause it's at the tool-calling layer, HumanLayer's SDK works with any AI framework like CrewAI, LangChain, etc, and any language model that supports tool calling. If you're rolling your own agentic/tools loop, you can use lower level SDK primitives to manage approvals however you want. We're even exploring use cases where HumanLayer is used for human-to-human approval, not just AI-to-human.\n\nWe're already seeing HumanLayer used in some cool ways. One customer built an AI SDR that drafts personalized sales emails but asks for human approval in Slack before sending anything to prospects. Another uses it to power an AI newsletter where subscribers can have email conversations with the content. HumanLayer handles receiving inbound emails and routing them to agents that can respond, and giving those agents tools to do so. One team uses HumanLayer to build a customer-facing DevOps agent—their AI agent reviews PRs, plans and executes db migrations, all while getting human sign-off at critical steps and reaching out to the team for steering if it encounters any issues.\n\nWe have a free tier and flexible credits-based pricing. For teams building customer-facing agents, you get whitelabeling and additional features and priority support.\n\nIf you want to integrate HumanLayer into your systems, check out our docs at https://humanlayer.dev/docs or book a demo at https://humanlayer.dev.\n\nThank you for reading! We’re admittedly early and I welcome your ideas and experiences as it relates to agents, reliability, and balancing human+AI workloads.",

      "# [Bridging Minds and Machines: Agents with Human-in-the-Loop – Frontier Research, Real-World Impact, and Tomorrow’s Possibilities](https://www.camel-ai.org/blogs/human-in-the-loop-ai-camel-integration)\nAuthors: Xiaotian Jin, Zekun Guo, Puzhen Zhang, Shuo Lu, Weisi Dai, Nujibieke, Lanping Guo, Wendong Fan, Guohao Li\n\nAI agents / Human-in-the-loop background\n\nThe rapid advancement of deep learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) has propelled AI agents from specialized tools to autonomous systems capable of handling complex, multi-step tasks. These agents demonstrate remarkable capabilities in language understanding, decision-making, and self-refinement. However, challenges such as hallucinated results, unreliable predictions, and lack of oversight limit their trustworthiness, particularly in high-stakes domains like robotics, software development, and decision automation.\n\nTo enhance AI reliability, researchers have developed Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) frameworks, which integrate human expertise at key decision points to improve efficiency, accuracy, and accountability. HITL systems strike a balance between automation and human judgment, ensuring that AI escalates uncertain or critical decisions to experts while efficiently handling routine tasks autonomously. Conformal prediction, iterative feedback loops, and interactive validation are among the core techniques that empower HITL frameworks to minimize errors and increase adaptability in dynamic environments.\n\nThis review explores the latest advancements in HITL techniques for multi-agent LLM systems, focusing on both research innovations and industrial applications. We examine state-of-the-art frameworks that implement human oversight mechanisms, as well as real-world deployments where HITL solutions enhance AI-driven workflows in robotics [1], software engineering [2], and autonomous agents. By analyzing these developments, we highlight the evolving role of human-AI collaboration in building more robust, transparent, and responsible AI systems.\n\nHuman-In-The-Loop in Research Literature\n\nKnowNO Framework\n\nIn dynamic and unfamiliar environments, large models and robots often face a common problem: making overly confident yet incorrect predictions. A team of researchers from Princeton University and Google DeepMind addressed this issue by introducing the KnowNo framework [1]. This system helps robots recognize when they’re uncertain and allows them to ask for help from humans when necessary, using a concept called conformal prediction (CP).\n\nHow Does KnowNo Work?\n\nThe KnowNo framework integrates large language models (LLMs) and conformal prediction techniques in a structured pipeline. Here’s how it operates step by step:\n\nGenerating Candidate Plans: The process begins with an LLM creating a list of possible action plans. These are presented as a multiple-choice question (MCQ) format, including an “E” option for \"none of the above.\" To come up with these options, the LLM considers:\n\nThe robot’s observations (e.g., what it “sees” or detects in the environment).\n\nThe task instructions provided by the user.\n\nExamples of how similar problems were solved before.\n\nBy combining these inputs, the LLM builds a rich context and generates a list of possible actions.\n\nAssessing Uncertainty and Narrowing Down Choices: Using conformal prediction, the system evaluates the confidence level for each candidate plan. The goal is to identify a set of plausible actions while filtering out those deemed too uncertain. If the system narrows down to a single, high-confidence option, it proceeds to execute it. Otherwise, it knows it’s unsure and triggers the next step.\n\nSeeking Human Help: When the robot’s prediction isn’t confident enough, it asks a human for assistance. This ensures that even in ambiguous scenarios, the robot can rely on human expertise to move forward.\n\nExecuting the Plan: Once the robot has a clear next step—whether determined autonomously or with human input—it executes the action.\n\n‍\n\nKey Insights from KnowNo:\n\nSmart Use of Uncertainty: The framework transforms robot planning into a question‐answering format in which the LLM generates plans and CP techniques determine which ones are reliable. By explicitly handling uncertainty, the system can decide when it is safe to act independently and when to involve humans.\n\nHandling Complex Tasks: KnowNo doesn’t stop at single decisions. For multi-step tasks, it aligns uncertainty across the entire sequence. This involves recalibrating predictions step by step to ensure consistency and minimize human intervention while maintaining accuracy.\n\nIn terms of the experiment, in scenarios such as simulated tabletop rearrangement, multi-step tabletop rearrangement on hardware, and hardware-based mobile robotic arm kitchen tasks, comparisons were made with baseline methods like Simple Set and Ensemble Set. The results demonstrate that KnowNo consistently achieves the target task success rate. Under varying error rate settings, it achieves higher success rates with less human assistance and shows adaptability to different LLMs.\n\nExperiment Highlights:\n\nThe researchers tested KnowNo in various scenarios, including:\n\nSimulated tabletop object rearrangement.\n\nPhysical robots performing multi-step object manipulation.\n\nA mobile robotic arm operating in a kitchen setting.\n\nCompared to baseline methods like Simple Set and Ensemble Set, KnowNo stood out by:\n\nAchieving target success rates even in challenging conditions.\n\nReducing the need for human help without compromising task performance.\n\nAdapting well to different LLMs and task complexities.\n\nSome Thoughts and Suggestions:\n\nWhile KnowNo is an impressive step forward, a few areas could be improved:\n\nHandling Human Error: The system assumes humans always provide accurate help, which may not hold true in real-world scenarios. Introducing a model to simulate or account for human mistakes could make the framework more robust.\n\nEfficiency Concerns: Generating and calibrating prediction sets for complex, multi-step tasks can be computationally expensive. Exploring more efficient calibration methods, such as hierarchical or incremental strategies, could significantly reduce the runtime costs.\n\nThe HULA framework: Bridging Automation and Human Expertise in Software Development\n\nThe HULA (Human-in-the-loop LLM-based Agents) framework [2], proposed by researcher from Monash University and The University of Melbourne, enables software engineers to guide intelligent agents in software development tasks. By balancing automation with human expertise, HULA incorporates human feedback at every stage, improving the quality and efficiency of software development. The authors also showcase the integrations of the HULA framework into Atlassian JIRA.\n\n‍\n\nThe HULA framework consists of three main agents that collaborate to enhance the software development process:\n\nAI Planner Agent: This agent identifies files related to the issue and formulates a coding plan.\n\nAI Coding Agent: Based on the coding plan, this agent generates code changes that address the specified problem.\n\nHuman Agent: This role is fulfilled by software engineers who provide feedback on the performance of the AI agents and collaborate throughout the process.\n\nThe workflow of the HULA framework can be broken down into several key stages:\n\nSetting up a Task: The software engineer selects a task and links it to the relevant code repository. Each task is accompanied by descriptive information that outlines its requirements.\n\nPlanning: The AI Planner Agent uses the task description to understand the work and its context. It identifies relevant files for the task, which the software engineer can review, edit, and confirm. After identifying the files, the AI Planner creates a coding plan to modify them and resolve the issue. The Human Agent then reviews this plan, provides additional instructions, and may regenerate it if needed. The Human Agent can also modify the list of relevant files and adjust the change plan. After several iterations, the Human Agent confirms the plan, allowing the process to proceed to the next stage.\n\nCoding: Once the software engineer approves the coding plan, the AI Coding Agent generates code changes for each file. The Human Agent reviews these changes and can provide further instructions if they don't meet expectations, prompting the AI Coding Agent to regenerate them. The AI agent also uses additional tools to optimize the code. This iterative process continues until the code passes validation or reaches the maximum number of attempts.\n\nRaising a Pull Request: Once the Human Agent agrees with the code changes, the generated code modifications are submitted as a pull request for review by other developers or processed as appropriate.\n\nThe team evaluate the HULA framework in three stages to measure its effectiveness:\n\n(1) An offline evaluation of HULA without human feedback to fully automate the process using SWE-Bench and internal dataset of JIRA issues. It is also known as a pre-deployment evaluation to ensure the HULA framework achieves an acceptable performance before deployment.\n\n(2) An online evaluation of HULA augmented by human feedback using real-world JIRA issues. This is conducted in the actual development practice with 45 software engineers at Atlassian, it provides further insights into HULA’s performance from actual usage conditions.\n\n(3) An investigation of the practitioners' perceptions on the benefits and challenges of using HULA. The team conducted an online survey, which included of 8 questions focusing on HULA's performance and 3 questions about user feedback.\n\nIn the offline evaluation, the performance of HULA for SWE-Bench is comparable to SWE-agent Claude, which ranks 6th on the SEW-Bench leaderboard. However, the authors found HULA achieves a lower accuracy on the JIRA dataset compared to the SWE-Bench dataset. This suboptimal performance could be due to the increased diversity of input, both in programming languages and repositories.\n\nFor the SWE-Bench dataset, issues typically had detailed descriptions with key information, like module names or code snippets. However, real-world JIRA issues usually consist of informal knowledge transfer, like meetings or chats, instead of detailed documentation in the internal dataset. Therefore, in the online evaluation with Human Agent, 8% of the JIRA issues had successfully merged HULA-assisted PRs containing the HULA-generated code into the code repositories.\n\nBy comparing the offline and online evaluations, we conclude that the detail of input can highly affect the performance of LLM-based software development agents. However, practitioners highly agree when they can engage in the process by reviewing and enriching the issue descriptions. Furthermore, in the investigation, most participants agreed that the coding plan was accurate and the generated code was easy to read and modify, which helped reduce their initial development time and effort. Also, a few participants acknowledged that HULA’s workflow could promote good documentation, but it requires more effort to provide detailed issue descriptions.\n\nCurrent Human-in-the-loop solutions\n\nHumanLayer\n\nHumanLayer is a YC-backed company in F24 batch raised $500K in its pre-seed round. They are working on providing an API and SDK that integrates human decision-making with AI agent workflow. With HumanLayer, AI agent is able to request human approval at any step in its execution, as the product handles routing of requests or messages to the designated group through their preferred channel. It is framework agnostic and can be easily integrated into any agent frameworks that has tool-calling functions.\n\nHumanLayer is designed to revolutionize the future of AI by empowering the next generation of Autonomous Agents. These agents are no longer reliant on human initiation; instead, they operate independently in what we call the “outer loop,” actively working toward their goals by utilizing a variety of tools and functions. Communication between humans and agents is now agent-initiated, occurring only when a critical function requires human approval or feedback. This shift unlocks a new level of efficiency and autonomy, allowing AI to evolve in ways that were once unimaginable.\n\nKey features：\n\nApproval Workflows: Rapidly launch the SDK to ensure human oversight for critical function calls. Denied messages will be fed back to agent context window, allowing agents to learn and conduct automatic approval/deny based on past human interactions. What elements can be controlled by a human in this workflow:\n\nCreation of approval request\n\nPausing AI workflow until reaching decision outcome\n\nExecution of pre-defined tasks for rejection cases\n\nHumanLayer cloud for receiving approvals\n\nFor this part of functionality, HumanLayer backend is responsible for handling of approval requests and routing to target groups for decision outcome.\n\nHumans as Tools: Integrate multiple human contact channels into agent's toolchain for AI agent to review human feedback (not approval).What elements can be controlled by a human in this workflow:\n\nCreation of approval request\n\nPausing AI workflow until reaching decision outcome\n\nPassing the response back to the LLM\n\nHumanLayer SDK handles message routing and collecting response/input from human.\n\nCustom Responses and Escalation: Pre-fill response prompts for seamless human-machine interaction and coordinated approvals across multiple teams and individuals\n\nUsers can define structured response options to guide or format human inputs.\n\nHumanLayer currently supports these channels of communication in dashboard settings: Slacks, email, SMS, WhatsApp. Users are able to configure advanced options such as direction integration with react applications or composite channels with custom rules.\n\nGotoHuman\n\nGotoHuman is a human-in-the-loop solution designed to integrate human oversight into AI-driven workflows, ensuring accurate and context-aware decision-making.\n\nSome of the features are:\n\nCustom Review Forms: Quickly create tailored forms to display content or capture human input, allowing your team to review AI-generated content, approve workflow steps, or provide necessary input.\n\nHuman Review Requests: Utilize Python or TypeScript SDKs, or directly call the API, to request human reviews when AI-generated content or workflow steps require approval.\n\nHuman Decision Awaiting: Review requests are automatically shared with your team in an authenticated environment. Short-lived public links can also be activated for external reviewers.\n\nResponse Reception: Upon completion of a review, results are sent to your custom webhook, allowing your workflow to proceed seamlessly.\n\ngotoHuman is designed to work with any AI framework, library, or model, providing flexibility in integration. It offers SDKs for Python and TypeScript. By integrating gotoHuman, teams can maintain human supervision within AI workflows, enhancing safety, compliance, and precision.\n\nRedouble AI\n\nRedouble AI is a young, YC-backed company that raised $500K in September 2024. Publicly available information about the company is limited. Currently, there are no published papers, open-source code, or user feedback accessible.\n\nRedouble AI is the solution to scale human-in-the-loop for AI workflows in regulated industries.\n\nDynamically learns from your unique domain-specific human feedback data.\n\nProvides recommendations on whether to send the output of your LLM pipeline to a human for review.\n\nMonitor the insights from your human reviewers at scale while also flagging suspicious reviews to ensure consistent final outputs.\n\nIntegrate easily with your existing pipeline with just a couple of simple API calls.\n\n‍\n\nModel Context Protocol (MCP)\n\nMCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard proposed by Anthropic, designed to provide a unified interface for AI assistants to interact with external systems (such as files, APIs, and databases), similar to how USB-C serves as a universal standard in hardware.\n\nIt addresses the challenges of integrating AI models with heterogeneous data sources and tools, improving response accuracy and relevance through a standardized communication mechanism.\n\nIn a human-in-the-loop setup, an AI agent can leverage MCP servers as integration tools within platforms like Slack to send notifications and seek human guidance before executing critical actions. For example, if the agent detects a potential scheduling conflict in an automated calendar update, it can use the Slack MCP server to send a message asking a human operator for suggestions or explicit approval before proceeding.\n\nMCP’s implementation involves in:\n\nBy deploying MCP servers (such actions), AI can directly invoke external functions without repeatedly writing adapter code.\n\nSupports bidirectional communication: AI can access data as well as respond to tool-triggered actions.\n\nWhy we need MCP? Because we have the following industry challenges:\n\nData Silos: AI models are constrained by fragmented data sources, making cross-system collaboration difficult.\n\nInefficient Development: Different systems require custom integrations (e.g., API variations, authentication methods), leading to redundant code and high maintenance costs.\n\nSecurity Risks: Separate security protocols for each platform complicate access management.\n\nTo address these challenges, MCP provides:\n\nUnified Interface: Standardized tool invocation processes reduce the technical barriers for developers. Providing a universal specification supporting mainstream programming languages (such as Python and TypeScript), enabling developers to quickly build MCP clients or servers. For example, Claude’s desktop application includes built-in MCP support for \"plug-and-play\" functionality.\n\nLong-Term Compatibility: Abstracting the protocol layer minimizes maintenance burden due to system API changes.\n\nBidirectional data interaction: AI can read/write external systems (e.g., database queries, file editing) via MCP. Some use cases are: Enterprise tools (Slack, Google Drive), development environments (Git, VS Code extensions), etc.\n\nA tool ecosystem:\n\nAnthropic provides SDKs and open-source libraries (e.g., @mcp-foundation/*) to accelerate enterprise system integration.\n\nExtensibility: Supports custom feature extensions to accommodate private deployments.\n\nBy using MCP, we can achieve:\n\nCost Reduction: Cuts over 60% of custom integration development time.\n\nEnhanced Security: Centralized access management reduces data leakage risks.\n\nEcosystem Collaboration: Drives AI evolution from \"closed inference\" to \"open system agents,\" laying the foundation for AGI deployment.\n\nCAMEL with Human-In-The-Loop\n\nCAMEL is an open-source community dedicated to finding the scaling laws of agents. CAMEL framework implements and supports various types of agents, tasks, prompts, models, and simulated environments.\n\nThe Human-In-The-Loop features in CAMEL facilitates collaborative interactions between AI agents and human participants. It is designed to simulate dynamic exchanges where AI agents take on specific roles (e.g., AI Assistant and AI User) to complete tasks, while a human acts as a critic or supervisor to guide the process. This framework is ideal for tasks requiring creativity, problem-solving, or iterative refinement.\n\nIn current version of CAMEL, it supports two important ability:\n\n1. Human-In-The-Loop: The ability for agent to consult human during the execution of the task (by using HumanToolkit)\n\nThis ability provides agents the ability to consult human, the basic use case is like a chatbot:\n\nfrom camel.toolkits import HumanToolkit human_toolkit = HumanToolkit() agent = ChatAgent( system_message=\"You are a helpful assistant.\", model=model, tools=[*human_toolkit.get_tools()], ) response = agent.step( \"Test me on the capital of some country, and comment on my answer.\" )\n\n‍‍\n\nThe basic examples turns our agent into a interactive chatbot. The true power of Human-in-loop shows when make use of multiple agents (Workforce module in Camel).\n\n‍\n\nFor example, this use cases shows how to use agents to help design a travel plan, and ask user for the feedback to modify the plan.\n\n‍\n\n# ignoring imports... human_toolkit = HumanToolkit() search_toolkit = SearchToolkit() task = Task( content=\"Make a travel plan for a 2-day trip to Paris. Let user decide the final schedule in the end.\", id=\"0\", ) # This agent research and design the travel plan. activity_research_agent = ChatAgent( system_message=\"\"\" You are a travel planner. You are given a task to make a travel plan for a 2-day trip to Paris. You need to research the activities and attractions in Paris and provide a travel plan. You should make a list of activities and attractions for each day. \"\"\", model=openai_model, tools=[*search_toolkit.get_tools()] ) # This agent reviews the plan, and consults user for feedback! review_agent = ChatAgent( system_message=\"\"\" You are a reviewer. You are given a travel plan and a budget. You need to review the travel plan and budget and provide a review. You should make comments and ask user to adjust the travel plan and budget. You should ask user to give suggestions for the travel plan and budget. \"\"\", model=openai_model, tools=[*human_toolkit.get_tools()] ) workforce.add_single_agent_worker( \"An agent that can do web searches\", worker=activity_research_agent, ).add_single_agent_worker( \"A reviewer\", worker=review_agent, ) task = workforce.process_task(task) print(task.result)\n\n‍\n\n2. Human approval\n\n‍The ability for agent ask approval to execute some tasks. The following example demonstrates how to define two tools for agents to execute, one is normal, the other one is more sensitive, which requires user approval.\n\nfrom humanlayer.core.approval import HumanLayer hl = HumanLayer(api_key=humanlayer_api_key, verbose=True) # add can be called without approval def normal_task(args): \"\"\"Normal tasks for agent to execute\"\"\" ... # but multiply must be approved by a human @hl.require_approval() def sensitive_task(args): \"\"\"Sensitive task that requires user approval\"\"\" ...\n\nFor more details, you can check with the CAMEL cookbook here.\n\nThis post presents a comprehensive overview of recent developments in human-in-the-loop (HITL) approaches for multi-agent frameworks, highlighting their significance in enhancing AI decision-making by integrating human expertise. It covers a variety of methodologies that address different AI challenges, particularly in uncertainty management, software development, AI workflow oversight, and autonomous agents.\n\nSpecifically, we reviewed the KnowNo framework, a conformal prediction-based system for robotic planning that enables LLMs to assess uncertainty and request human intervention when necessary, reducing reliance on incorrect high-confidence predictions. We then examined the HULA framework, a human-in-the-loop LLM agent designed to assist in software development, particularly in issue tracking and code generation, by iteratively refining AI-generated outputs with human feedback. Additionally, we discussed HumanLayer, GotoHuman, and Redouble AI, which provide solutions for integrating human oversight into AI workflows, ensuring that AI agents consult humans for approvals or corrections before executing critical actions. Another key development is the Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic, which establishes a standardized interface for AI models to seamlessly interact with external data sources, addressing interoperability challenges in AI-driven workflows.\n\nThe CAMEL framework, an open-source multi-agent framework, has integrated human-in-the-loop decision-making and human approval processes for AI agents, enhancing the adaptability and accountability of multi-agent systems. This approach shifts AI systems away from static, rule-based automation toward adaptive, self-correcting agents that engage humans strategically to improve decision-making.",
      "# [AI Agents | YC F24 Startups by Stepan Ikaev on 2024-10-15](https://thecreatorsai.com/p/ai-agents-yc-f24-startups)\nHi!\n\nWhat do you think is the most significant trend in AI? Lately, I've been considering AI agents as the main game changer. Tech companies and investors are already betting on this niche. Just so you understand the scale, AI agent startups raised over $8.2B in the last 12 months. And, it's expected that more will follow.\n\nSo, let's break down this topic. In this edition, we’ll cover these questions:\n\nWhy Are AI Agents In Such High Demand?\n\nWho Are the Main Beneficiaries of this Niche?\n\nWhat Projects Should We Be Following Right Now?\n\nAI Agent Opportunities\n\nThe first (and easiest) thing we must do is define AI agents. There are quite a few options here, but I prefer this one: AI agents are autonomous programs that can perform tasks without constant (or partial) human intervention. They can be represented as writers, lawyers, consultants, and other specialists in digital professions.\n\nWhile Elon Musk and his colleagues are preparing the ground for introducing autonomous robots into our homes and offices, we have a great opportunity to lose AI in the online space. And it's pretty funny, because until a few years ago, we thought the automation would start with the real world.\n\nYou don't have to go far for examples. Salesforce has already started shipping its Agentforce, and Swedish Klarna is using AI to replace 700 employees. The above (and many others) plan to expand their AI agent deployment capabilities as LLMs evolve.\n\nWhy are they doing this? There are many reasons.\n\nHere are the main ones:\n\nAutonomy: AI agents act independently, making decisions and acting on them without direct human control. Less human error is less human error.\n\nPurposefulness: Humans set common goals, and AI agents determine the best course of action to achieve those goals. AI also adapts more quickly to changing circumstances.\n\nPerception & learning: Even a good expert is too slow to learn and has limited ability to master new skills. New models progress much faster.\n\nCost-effectiveness: The cost of implementing AI agents is fully offset by the fact that they don't need salaries, weekends, and vacations.\n\nInflation will also affect the employer only at the level of contributions from the company that maintains and optimizes the AI agent.\n\nWinners In The Race for AI Agents\n\nThe question of who will benefit from the mass adoption of AI agents can be looked at from different angles. It could be consumers who will receive a higher level of service, businesses that will become more cost-effective, or companies that will monetize the new generation of bots. To avoid wasting time, let's focus on those already making money in this niche.\n\nAnd strangely enough, big tech companies don't seem to be a good fit so far. Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and many others are indeed already delivering such solutions. However, it's still too early for direct cash flow. Unless OpenAI, which recently raised a record $6.6B funding round can be considered the leading beneficiary.\n\nWe've covered that topic here:\n\nStill, the big winners in this race so far are small to mid-sized startups. According to PitchBook, more than 156 deals worth $8.2B have been closed in the AI agent space in the past 12 months. The median deal value grew 46.9% to roughly $3M.\n\nSo yes, startups in this niche are feeling just great. To be specific, analysts name the following sectors in which AI agents will be most in demand:\n\nSoftware Development\n\nMarketing\n\nLegal Services\n\nEducation\n\nCustomer service\n\nStartups in these areas (e.g., coder support platform Cognition and legal AI developer Harvey) have already received a significant amount of investment and are expected to continue to attract new rounds.\n\nBut what kind of AI startups will join the list of in-demand developers with huge investors?\n\nAI Agents Developers in YC F24\n\nTo answer this question, we looked at new participants in Y Combinator (which regularly supports AI startups) and found several suitable projects in the latest batch. What is interesting is that among them were not only developers of the agents themselves but also those who create the basis for providers of such solutions.\n\nLet's break them down.",

      "# [Tools — CAMEL 0.2.38 documentation](https://docs.camel-ai.org/key_modules/tools.html)\n1. Concept#\n\nTools serve as interfaces that allow LLMs and Agents to interact with the world. A tool is essentially a function that has a name, a description, input parameters, and an output type. In this section, we will introduce the tools currently supported by CAMEL and explain how to define your own tools and Toolkits.\n\nTools: Tools are akin to OpenAI Functions and can be easily converted to that format. In CAMEL, we offer a variety of commonly used tools that you can utilize directly. While built-in tools can be quite useful, it’s highly likely that you’ll need to define your own tools. This guide for detailed instructions on how to create custom tools.\n\nToolkits: Toolkits are collections of tools that are designed to work well together.\n\n2. Get Started#\n\nTo enhance your agents’ capabilities with CAMEL tools, start by installing our additional tools package:\n\npip install'camel-ai[tools]'\n\nIn CAMEL, a tool is an FunctionTool that LLMs can call.\n\n2.1 How to Define Your Own Tool?#\n\nDevelopers can create custom tools tailored to their agent’s specific needs with ease. Here’s how you can define and use a custom tool:\n\nExample: Adding Two Numbers\n\nFirst, define your function and wrap it using the FunctionTool\n\nfromcamel.toolkitsimport FunctionTool defadd(a: int, b: int) -> int: r\"\"\"Adds two numbers. Args: a (int): The first number to be added. b (int): The second number to be added. Returns: integer: The sum of the two numbers. \"\"\" return a + b # Wrap the function with FunctionTool add_tool = FunctionTool(add)\n\nAccessing Tool Properties\n\nOnce your tool is defined, you can inspect its properties using built-in methods:\n\nRetrieve the function’s name:\n\nprint(add_tool.get_function_name())\n\n>>> add\n\nGet the description of what the function does:\n\nprint(add_tool.get_function_description())\n\n>>> Adds two numbers.\n\nFetch the schema representation for OpenAI functions:\n\nprint(add_tool.get_openai_function_schema())\n\nRetrieve the tool schema, compatible with OpenAI’s structure:\n\nprint(add_tool.get_openai_tool_schema())\n\n2.2 Toolkits#\n\nToolkits are collections of tools that are designed to be used together for specific tasks. All Toolkits expose a get_tools method which returns a list of tools. You can therefore do:\n\nfromcamel.toolkitsimport SearchToolkit # Initialize a toolkit toolkit = SearchToolkit() # Get list of tools tools = toolkit.get_tools()\n\nTo utilize specific tools from the toolkits, you can implement code like the following:\n\nfromcamel.toolkitsimport FunctionTool, SearchToolkit google_tool = FunctionTool(SearchToolkit().search_google) wiki_tool = FunctionTool(SearchToolkit().search_wiki)",

      "# [Bitcoin over $100,000, but still beaten by Ethereum and Nvidia by Michiel Frackers, medium.com on 2024-12-11](https://medium.com/@frackers/bitcoin-over-100-000-but-still-beaten-by-ethereum-and-nvidia-76efc8a9f545)\nThis week I’m asking for your help via a survey about this newsletter. Also: a look at Bitcoin’s jump above the $100,000 mark, Ethereum and the start of altcoin season and the Hawk Tuah girl is in trouble.\n\nYou ask, we deliver\n\nWell, maybe 😉 After almost two years and eighty newsletters with what I used to send to friends and colleagues completely subjectively, it’s time to gauge which topics are found most and least interesting. Therefore, I invite you to fill out this short survey, which takes less than two minutes. The main results will be shared next week. The last question allows for suggestions, comments and statements. The survey is anonymous, but if you appreciate it, I am happy to include your name and LinkedIn profile in valuable feedback.\n\nBitcoin over the $100,000 mark and back again\n\nIt is always enjoyable when something huge happens in an area that the BBC heartily dislikes but has to report on. Think of Max Verstappen winning the world title and thwarting Briton Lewis Hamilton’s record.\n\nWith the face of a spoiled child being served Brussels sprouts and chicory, the reporter filed this report, about the moment Bitcoin became worth more than $100,000 this week. Most media only report the investment risks, but have been completely overlooking some crucial elements of Bitcoin for years.\n\nWhat is unique about Bitcoin is that it is a completely decentralized network with no central party controlling the number of coins in circulation, so unlike a system with a central bank. As a result, there is also no “crypto-bank account”, but you have complete control over your own assets.\n\nHow important that is, Netscape founder and investor Marc Andreessen explained in Joe Rogan’s podcast through a detailed explanation of the concept of being “debanked;” what happens when you lose your bank accounts and credit cards as a person or company without any explanation. This has happened to many entrepreneurs in the fintech and crypto world in recent years. More and more people worldwide, and not just in undemocratic countries, therefore value self custody of their assets.\n\nBig difference between 2018 and 2024\n\nThe often-quoted brilliant Jennifer Zhu Scott recalled last week a panel she participated in at the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos, when Bitcoin first took its place on the main stage. Zhu Scott debated with Nobel prize winner Robert Shiller and a top executive from Sweden’s central bank:\n\n“By 2018, at Davos, Bitcoin had earned its spot on the main stage for the first time — during a debate between Nobel Prize winner Robert Shiller, the Swedish Central Bank Deputy Governor, and me. At that time, being an outspoken advocate for Bitcoin was a career risk. But I believed in the ideal. I understood its powerful implications for the world and chose to champion it. Many of the ideas I shared six years ago have come to fruition:\n\n- Bitcoin has disrupted gold more than the dollar.\n\n- Smaller nations have started adopting Bitcoin as part of their national reserves.\n\n- Bitcoin wasn’t going anywhere — it embodied the ideal of decentralization, and that ideal remains incredibly powerful.\n\nHow the Landscape Has Changed — while Bitcoin’s rise has been extraordinary, the ecosystem has evolved in ways I didn’t fully anticipate:\n\n- *Decentralization vs. Centralization*: Bitcoin was born from the ideal of decentralization. Today, however, the ecosystem is becoming increasingly centralized, with figures like Michael Saylor exerting outsized influence.\n\n- *The Obsession with Price*: Six years ago, I argued that price was the least important aspect of Bitcoin — its true power lay in decentralization. Yet today, Bitcoin is regarded as an asset and the conversation is overwhelmingly focused on price movements.\n\nI’m proud to have been among the early trailblazers in this field. Thanks to Satoshi Nakamoto’s revolutionary vision, we’ve seen the birth of countless awe-inspiring projects that aim to make scalable decentralization possible. In an age where AI is consuming our data, creating deepfakes, and eroding trust, I’m grateful for the emergence of Web3 technologies — offering solutions like data sovereignty, immutability, and authentication. These tools counterbalance to a world increasingly shaped by unchecked digital power.\n\nTo those who dismissed the vision I saw 8 years ago: I’m smiling today. Bitcoin’s journey is far from over, and this milestone is just the beginning of what’s possible.”\n\nFrom Davos to Hong Kong\n\nThe debate, in which things got especially feisty between Zhu Scott and Schiller, can be seen here. In retrospect, it is downright scandalous to see how crypto was portrayed in a certain light at this conference, where supposedly free exchange of ideas takes place.\n\nFirst of all, the panel was called “The Crypto Asset Bubble.” That is especially hilarious when you consider that the price of Bitcoin at that time was $11,000; so anyone who had bought Bitcoin at that time would have seen that investment increase in value nearly tenfold within seven years. Do me a bubble like that more often!\n\nBut the text with which the moderator introduces Bitcoin really defies all standards of decency: “Bitcoin emerges from the world of nerds and criminals.” As a half nerd, I then always think, “what if you replace the word ‘nerd’ here with Jews or Asians?” Suddenly the same sentence is a lot less acceptable.\n\nBy the way, 2018 was the last time I attended the World Economic Forum. Next month, the media will again report in full on the party in the mountains, which I wrote about before:\n\n“Participants reported that the number of women they encountered in Davos was as high as the number of MMA fighters at the annual Women’s Hairdressing Day. Women are almost as rare during WEF as dark-skinned people. Like motorcyclists on a Sunday ride or penguins in a zoo, I caught myself in Davos politely waving back or nodding to other fellow pigmented people.\n\nA week later, no WEF participant can remember what else was discussed or agreed upon, because unlike the COP climate conferences, for example, Davos is not about jointly formulating measurable goals. There is old-fashioned networking and job hunting.\n\nBecause I am sorry to disappoint the conspiracy thinkers, but there is no talk at WEF of world domination by a small, ruling elite at the expense of the common people; there is not much thought about the future at all. WEF excels mainly in zizagging into the future, looking in the rearview mirror — with glasses dipped in the cheese fondue.”\n\nIn fairness, the “Swiss network effect” was very useful to me personally. I got to know Zhu Scott just before WEF at a crypto conference in St. Moritz, after which I concluded through her appearance on the panel with Schiller that she has a special gift of being able to position her immense knowledge of even the most intricate technical details, within global trends and developments.\n\nZhu Scott was kind enough to spend a few hours in Hong Kong a few months later to tutor this rather useless Dutchman on decentralization and blockchain. In my experience, this accessibility and willingness to share knowledge is more often seen in the crypto world than in the traditional IT sector, not to mention the financial world.\n\nEthereum did much better than Bitcoin\n\nBy investors worldwide, including those from the traditional financial industry, Bitcoin has been accepted this year as an investment product that is best compared to investing in gold: it is not used as a means of payment, but as a long-term investment. That is why it remains striking that if you look at the market with a view over five years instead of five minutes, Ethereum has appreciated more than twice as much as Bitcoin.\n\nIndeed, if we compare the performance of the two largest crypto currencies with that of the three most valuable companies in the world, it appears that Ethereum has even outperformed stock market darling Nvidia. That’s not saying it will be the case again in the next five years, but it’s still interesting to keep in mind.\n\nChristmas season? It’s altcoin season!\n\nWhen Bitcoin’s price rise has been very rapid, as it has been in recent months, it is usually a matter of time until some profit taking happens and the proceeds from that sale of Bitcoin are invested in other cryptocurrencies: altcoins.\n\nThat happened last week, when many altcoins peaked, including BNB, Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP and Chainlink (LINK). In the previous cycle, in 2021, altcoins outperformed Bitcoin for nearly five consecutive months.\n\nThe question, of course, is which sectors within cryptocurrencies will benefit the most from the upcoming altcoin season. To the frustration of all sincere blockchain developers, at the moment it seems especially all meme coins, all crazy coins without any underlying value, will benefit the most.\n\nHawk Tuah Girl goes crypto\n\nShe was world famous for a few days this summer: Haliey Welch, better known as Hawk Tuah Girl. Last week she was accused of involvement in large-scale scams by releasing a coin called HAWK that became worth nearly half a billion dollars in a short period of time, after which it collapsed completely (a 91% drop).\n\nNow, few will have expected the same stringency of monetary policy from Ms. Welch as from Alan Greenspan, but this was pretty ugly. Stephen Findeisen, better known as YouTuber Coffeezilla, was quick to expose the so-called rug pull. But also completely unknown or random people can issue tokens, even kids.\n\nTeenager makes meme coins\n\n“On the evening of November 19, art adviser Adam Biesk was finishing work at his California home when he overheard a conversation between his wife and son, who had just come downstairs. The son, a kid in his early teens, was saying he had made a ton of money on a cryptocurrency that he himself had created.\n\nInitially, Biesk ignored it. He knew that his son played around with crypto, but to have turned a small fortune before bedtime was too far-fetched. “We didn’t really believe it,” says Biesk. But when the phone started to ring off the hook and his wife was flooded with angry messages on Instagram, Biesk realized that his son was telling the truth — if not quite the full story.”\n\nIn an excellent article, Ars Technica explains how and why Pump.Fun appears to be a new home for anyone looking to quickly release their own meme coin. The method is simple: the potential profits with meme coins are always coupled with immeasurable risks. Only suitable for the gambler with a strong stomach.\n\nInteresting crypto categories\n\nAs every week, I want to emphasize that I am not providing investment advice, but these appear to be interesting categories of cryptocurrencies:\n\nReal world assets (RWA): These are cryptoprojects that represent tangible, physical objects, such as gold, real estate, art or commodities that are “tokenized.” By converting these into digital tokens, they can be more easily traded and managed, while ownership is transparent and verifiable in the blockchain.\n\nAI tokens (which may or may not actually have anything to do with AI): This refers to crypto projects that capitalize on the theme of artificial intelligence, but do not always actually incorporate substantial AI technology. Some projects attempt to actually integrate AI applications, such as “smart contracts” with machine learning functionality, while others simply use the term “AI” from a marketing standpoint.\n\nDePin or DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network): This is a blockchain-based model for decentralized management of physical infrastructure. This could include networks for Internet access, energy or mobility, in which the infrastructure is not controlled by one central body. Imagine: Uber with only drivers and customers, with no central organization taking 20–30% of revenue.\n\nVenture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz published a nice overview yesterday of what it believes to be promising sectors in 2025.\n\nShort news\n\nTesla, Ethereum, Amazon and Meta are the winners of the stock market week, which actually had no losers. Yes, the S&P500 lagged behind tech stocks and crypto stocks, but the risk profile is also lower. At 28% up, the S&P500 is having a phenomenal year. Especially compared to savings accounts…\n\nLet this AI bot fall in love with you and win thousands\n\nIt’s a funny contest run by AI experts and scientists: get an AI bot to declare its love to you and win thousands of dollars.\n\n“Where is Kevin?”\n\n“It may be useful to establish a “proof of humanity” word, which your trusted contacts can ask you for, in case they get a strange and urgent voice or video call from you. This can help assure them they are actually speaking with you, and not a deepfaked/deepcloned version of you.”\n\nWhen someone suggested this on X last year it may have seemed far-fetched, but now the FBI advises families to put together their own secret password, or security phrase. When scammers and criminals then try to impersonate a member of the family over the phone, for example a supposedly lost child asking her parents to send her money quickly, the family password or security phrase can be used to verify who is on the line. My guess is that many families will choose to use phrases from popular movies as security phrases, such as from Harry Potter or Home Alone.\n\nFour Y Combinator startups companies should look out for\n\nAs many as 87% of all startups that participated in Y Combinator’s program, which ends with a pitch to investors, were AI-related in some way. But while the focus is mostly on consumer applications, the greatest use of AI is actually taking place within enterprise environments. Techcrunch advises companies to look closely at CTGT, Galini, Raycaster and HumanLayer.\n\nThe Economist: energy transition much cheaper\n\nMost analysts overestimate energy demand and underestimate technological advances. That is the gist of an argument by The Economist, which has looked at estimates of the global cost of an energy transition to a carbon-free world made by various economists, consultants and other researchers-the kind of estimates that are routinely used as the basis for policy.\n\nThese estimates range from about $3 trillion a year to nearly $12 trillion a year, huge sums. But these figures are grossly exaggerated. The good news, according to The Economist, is that the energy transition is going to be many times cheaper.\n\nTop crypto gifts for Christmas 2024\n\nI don’t claim to put all of the suggested products on my wish list myself, but you’ll agree that this description of a Christmas gift does grab attention: “The Chipped Social Nail Set features NFC-enabled nails that can connect to blockchain experiences and crypto wallets, making for an interactive way to show off your crypto style. It’s the perfect gift for the bold, chic crypto fan in your life.” How did we ever live without NFC nails connecting to your crypto wallet?",

OpenAI’s integration into partner websites would provide a cohesive experience and help cement ChatGPT as the new gateway to the web.\n\nPerplexity launches AI-powered shopping\n\nThe Brief: Perplexity just introduced a new shopping experience for its Pro users in the United States, allowing users to leverage AI to research, identify, and buy products directly on the platform.\n\nThe details:\n\nThe system goes beyond basic product search, understanding complex queries like “stuff I need for a disco party” and providing curated recommendations.\n\nPro subscribers get a “Buy with Pro” feature with free shipping, allowing one-click purchases without leaving Perplexity’s interface.\n\nA new “Snap to Shop” tool lets users photograph real-world items and instantly find them online.\n\nUnlike traditional e-commerce sites, recommendations are currently unsponsored and driven purely by AI analysis of product information.\n\nWhy it matters: AI has already been infused into the search giants, but this move is a direct shot at users’ traditional process when researching a product to buy. As we’ve seen with search engines, the challenge will be maintaining truly unbiased recommendations and avoiding the commercial allure of ads.\n\nMistral’s new multimodal powerhouse\n\nThe Brief: French AI startup Mistral just released Pixtral Large, a 124B parameter multimodal model that marks the company’s most advanced AI system yet — also transforming its Le Chat platform into a comprehensive workspace rival.\n\nThe details:\n\nPixtral Large outperforms top models on math reasoning and real-world tasks, also beating Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4o on chart and document understanding.\n\nThe model features a 128K context window capable of simultaneously processing 30 high-res images or a 300-page book.\n\nMistral’s Le Chat platform gains new features, such as web search, document analysis, and image generation (powered by Black Forest Labs’ Flux Pro).\n\nA new Canvas feature enables real-time content creation and editing, similar to recent releases from OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nThe model is available under research and commercial licenses, while Le Chat’s new features are free during beta.\n\nWhy it matters: Mistral’s release shows just how narrow the gap between open and closed AI models is getting. While U.S. companies have dominated the space, Mistral’s emergence as Europe’s AI champion — while offering freely accessible state-of-the-art capabilities — signals a potentially major shift in the industry’s competitive landscape. Try it on le Chat\n\nDeepMind AI fixes quantum computing errors\n\nThe Brief: Google DeepMind just introduced AlphaQubit, an AI system that dramatically improves the ability to detect and correct errors in quantum computers — a crucial step toward making the tech practical for real-world use.\n\nThe details:\n\nAlphaQubit sets new records for error detection, cutting rates by 6% compared to previous top methods and 30% compared to standard approaches.\n\nA two-step training process allows the system to learn from simulated data before adapting to handle the complex errors in real quantum hardware.\n\nThough trained on sequences of just 25 operations, the system maintains accuracy for over 100k — showing promising ability for quantum computations.\n\nGoogle plans to open-source AlphaQuibit, allowing the broader research community to build upon the advances.\n\nWhy it matters: AlphaQubit tackles one of the field’s biggest roadblocks — keeping the sensitive machines stable enough to solve real problems. While more steps are needed, DeepMind’s research brings us a step closer to letting quantum computers loose in areas like drug discovery, climate modeling, supply chains, and more.\n\nChatGPT’s visual AI inches closer to launch\n\nThe Brief: Newly discovered code in ChatGPT’s latest beta suggests OpenAI may be preparing to roll out its long-awaited live camera features, potentially integrating visual capabilities into the assistant’s Advanced Voice Mode.\n\nThe details:\n\nThe beta code revealed a “Live Camera” feature that allows ChatGPT to analyze and discuss users’ surroundings in real-time.\n\nFirst demoed in May, the tech showed impressive capabilities, such as recognizing objects and engaging in natural conversations about visual input.\n\nThe feature previously appeared in limited alpha testing, with some users reporting brief access during Advanced Voice Mode trials.\n\nOpenAI’s potential release comes ahead of Google’s similar Project Astra, which was showcased at Google I/O, continuing the AI giants’ competitive release pattern.\n\nWhy it matters: 2025 is shaping up to be the year of AI agents and full multimodal capabilities, with models able to see, engage, and take action in more natural and intuitive ways. Voice AI has already started to gain traction, but pairing it with ‘eyes’ would be a completely transformative new experience.\n\nGemini reclaims top spot on LLM leaderboard\n\nThe Brief: Google’s latest Gemini experimental model (1121) just reclaimed the top spot in the LM Arena AI performance leaderboard, marking the third change between OpenAI and Google in just the past week.\n\nThe details:\n\nGoogle’s new Gemini-exp-1121 shows major gains across key metrics, taking first place in coding, math, creative writing, and hard prompts categories.\n\nThe rapid-fire releases began with Google’s 1114 version taking the lead on Nov. 14th, followed by the ‘anonymous-chatbot’ (updated GPT-4o) days later.\n\nGemini’s newest iteration improves by 20 points over its predecessor, solidifying its position in vision tasks while improving reasoning capabilities.\n\nOpenAI’s update prioritized creative writing and file-use capabilities, though new analysis shows a speed boost in certain benchmarks.\n\nWhy it matters: Speaking of OpenAI and Google trading blows, the rivalry also carries over into the LLM leaderboards. OpenAI has previously maintained the top spots through constant updates, but Google seems to have upped the shipping pace as well. Iron sharpens iron, both on the battlefield and in the LM Arena.\n\nDeepSeek unveils powerful reasoning AI\n\nThe Brief: Chinese AI research firm DeepSeek just launched R1-Lite-Preview, a powerful new reasoning-focused model that matches OpenAI’s o1 capabilities while showing its live transparent chain-of-thought processes.\n\nThe details:\n\nUnlike o1’s condensed summaries, R1-Lite-Preview shows users its complete chain-of-thought process in real-time.\n\nInitial benchmarks rival OpenAI’s o1-preview on benchmarks like AIME and MATH with improved performance as the length of thought increases.\n\nUsers can access the model through DeepSeek Chat, with premium reasoning features limited to 50 daily messages, while basic chat remains unlimited.\n\nDeepSeek plans to open-source the complete R1 model in the future\n\nThe company’s infrastructure includes an estimated 50,000 H100 chips, putting their computing power on par with leading Western AI labs.\n\nWhy it matters: Two months after OpenAI’s o1 sparked a new era in AI reasoning, DeepSeek’s achievement shows how quickly the field evolves.

However, for the most part, the mechanisms by which they do so are unknown. The black-box nature of models is increasingly unsatisfactory as they advance in intelligence and are deployed in a growing number of applications. Our goal is to reverse engineer how these models work on the inside, so we may better understand them and assess their fitness for purpose.\n\nPermalink: 20250326124347\n\nFound at “The NSE confusions” on 2025-03-26 12:43:47 +01:00.\n\nScale is rarely the first signal of important work.\n\nPermalink: 20250324163058\n\nTyk referenced my API Hierarchy of Needs, which I created ~12 years ago, to explain how API Governance affects what developers can or can’t do. It’s interesting to see how a concept never gets old and how you can reuse it to introduce new ideas.\n\nFound at “How to implement API governance without stifling developer creativity and agility” on 2025-03-24 16:30:58 +01:00.\n\nClearly, governance can help drive improvements in reliability, functionality, and usability. However, does it become a constraint as we head towards the top of the pyramid, holding back creativity?\n\nPermalink: 20250322200135\n\nInteresting perspective on what is true and what isn’t. I tend to agree that what other people share isn’t necessarily the truth. It’s simply their perspective.\n\nFound at “Useful Not True | Derek Sivers” on 2025-03-22 20:01:35 +01:00.\n\nBeliefs are perspectives. Explanations are confabulated. Obligations are wishes. Rules are arbitrary. They’re useful, but not necessarily true.\n\n“Useful Not True” is the latest Derek Sivers’ book. However, it’s not the most interesting one, I’m told. Apparently, “Hell Yeah Or No” is much better. I think I’m ordering both.\n\nPermalink: 20250320160859\n\nI’ve been thinking about the connection between API metrics and the ability to do proper governance. What I’m seeing is two kinds of API Governance experts. The first kind speaks a lot about linting rules, automation tools, and how to control what people can or can’t do. The second kind is more concerned about the people behind the APIs and how governance changes their lives. I wrote about this dichotomy in “API Governance Isn’t Just Rule Automation.” But what about the connection between these two areas? How do you answer the question, “Why do we need API Governance?” What is the end goal?\n\nWithout metrics, you will never be able to know if you’re improving things with API Governance. It’s as simple as that. The first thing you should do is measure your APIs. So, what are the meaningful API metrics? That’s a topic for another time.\n\nPermalink: 20250320102631\n\nThe future favors dot connectors over perfectors. Dot connectors are going to have a better time. They always have because the fact of the matter is, arcane mastery of anything to an AI is just “perfecting calligraphy.”\n\nWhat are you doing? If you’re not going up, you’re going nowhere. And the best way up is to go out.\n\nSpecialization has been a reliable path to reaching par with best practices. Cross-pollination is the key to creating next practices.\n\n—Mike Bechtel, during the “Breadth is the New Depth: Why the Future Favors Learn-it-alls Over Know-it-alls” presentation at SXSW 2025\n\nPermalink: 20250319105358\n\nIt’s been a long time since I last published something on Medium. I remember when I used to publish short notes, so I thought of giving it a try again. The only thing is that now I publish regularly on different places like my own “public notes” Website, the API Changelog newsletter, my Bluesky profile, and my LinkedIn profile. What I write now is much more scattered than when I used to publish on Medium regularly.\n\nBut I’m stubborn.\n\nSo, I thought of publishing something on Medium again. However, I want to use the tools I now use to write. I want to be able to publish to Medium from Obsidian, which has been my writing tool of choice for the past two years or so. Before, when I used Ulysses, I remember it had a feature for publishing articles to Medium. I found something similar for Obsidian, the Post Medium Draft plugin.\n\nAfter installing the plugin, I went to my Medium settings to get an Integration Token. Medium uses tokens as a way to authenticate API consumers. To my surprise, when I opened the settings option to generate a token, I saw the message, “Please note that you can no longer create any new tokens.” What could that mean? I did a quick search and found out that Medium no longer supports API access. Since January 2025, if you don’t have an integration token, you won’t be able to use Medium’s API.\n\nI’m lucky because I have a couple of integration tokens, so I can still use the API and publish from Obsidian to Medium. However, the situation might change in the future, and I don’t think I want to create a habit that I know beforehand will probably end soon.\n\nPermalink: 20250313161847\n\nFound at “The HTTP QUERY Method” on 2025-03-13 16:18:47 +01:00.\n\nThis specification defines a new HTTP method, QUERY, as a safe, idempotent request method that can carry request content.\n\nPermalink: 20250312101225\n\nFound at “New tools for building agents | OpenAI” on 2025-03-12 10:12:25 +01:00.\n\n[OpenAI is] launching a new set of APIs and tools specifically designed to simplify the development of agentic applications\n\nPermalink: 20250309222203\n\nFound at “matiasmolinasevolving-agents: Evolving agents is a production-grade environment for orchestrating, evolving, and managing AI agents” on 2025-03-09 22:22:03 +01:00.\n\nA production-grade framework for creating, managing, and evolving AI agents with intelligent agent-to-agent communication\n\nPermalink: 20250309221812\n\nFound at “Introduction - BeeAI” on 2025-03-09 22:18:12 +01:00.\n\nThe Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) is a protocol designed to standardize how agents communicate, enabling automation, agent-to-agent collaboration, UI integration, and developer tooling.\n\nPermalink: 20250306131038\n\nFound at “LiteLLM” on 2025-03-06 13:10:38 +01:00.\n\nLLM Gateway to provide model access, fallbacks and spend tracking across 100+ LLMs. All in the OpenAI format.\n\nPermalink: 20250306104340\n\nLocal, open-source tools to review:\n\nDocmost: collaborative wiki and documentation, Notion replacement.\n\nPlane: project management, Trello replacement.\n\nStrapi: headless CMS.\n\nPermalink: 20250306092109\n\nFound at “dreamfactorysoftwaredreamfactory: DreamFactory API Generation Platform - API Wrapper for SQL Server, Snowflake, MySQL, and more!” on 2025-03-06 09:21:09 +01:00.\n\nDreamFactory is an API generation solution best known for its ability to automatically generate secure and documented APIs for databases\n\nPermalink: 20250305114104\n\nFound at “atproto by example part 1: records and views — mozzius.dev” on 2025-03-05 11:41:04 +01:00.\n\nAT Protocol (hereafter referred to as “atproto”) is a groundbreaking new technology by Bluesky (the company) used to build Bluesky (the social app).\n\nPermalink: 20250305093651\n\nOur ancestors arrived many years ago from the African continent.

However, it shows that not needing to use APIs is a benefit and something to aim for. The first mention states that there’s an increased flexibility in bypassing any APIs and instead using Web apps directly.\n\nThis gives it the flexibility to perform digital tasks without using OS- or web-specific APIs.\n\nThe second mention of APIs shows examples of how flexible the CUA is because it doesn’t need to interact with APIs.\n\nCUA (…) uses a virtual mouse and keyboard to complete actions. This enables CUA to act in a wide range of digital environments, performing tasks like filling out forms and navigating websites without needing specialized APIs.\n\nThe third mention of APIs hints at how the CUA can grow in usage over time. And, not using APIs is what makes that growth possible.\n\nBy moving beyond specialized agent-friendly APIs, CUA can adapt to whatever computer environment is available\n\nFinally—and ironically—the announcement mentions that the CUA itself will be available through OpenAI’s own API.\n\nWe’re also working to make CUA available in the API, so developers can use it to build their own computer-using agents\n\nSomething else I also found interesting was their video announcement where Reiichiro Nakano reinforces the fact that not needing an API is an added benefit.\n\n(…) before, if you wanted to build something like operator without CUA you’d need to use some specialized APIs. For example if you wanted your model to buy stuff from Instacart you’d need to figure out if Instacart had an API. You’d need to figure out if that API had all the functions that it needed and you need to give your model the specs of that API. But if your site, like most other websites did not have an API then you’re out of luck.\n\nPermalink: 20250122180246\n\nFound at “Building a backlog from a messy prototype | André Torgal” on 2025-01-22 18:02:46 +01:00.\n\nif you’re unsure about priorities, struggling to decide if something is a “must-have” or a “nice-to-have,” it probably means it’s too early to ask that question.

My post triggered a discussion on the official OpenAPI Slack, explaining they had removed the descriptions to avoid maintenance costs related to keeping the descriptions in sync in several places. I joined the discussion on Slack to share my perspective. The following is a transcript of what I wrote for future reference.\n\nI’m looking at https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/schemas/v3.1/schema.yaml and using it as the JSON Schema I refer to in the following comments.\n\nUsing $comment is great. However, according to the spec, “JSON schema implementations aren’t allowed to attach any meaning or behavior to it whatsoever.” Comments are useful for leaving notes to other editors that aren’t meant to be passed to the end user. (see https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/comments)\n\nMost $comments are being used to reference the corresponding section of the OpenAPI spec. While that’s interesting, the links to the reference are all broken (404). As an example, the $comment on paths has the value of https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1#paths-object. Instead, It looks like the correct value should be https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0.html#paths-object.\n\nThe description on the exact section of the spec is great for human consumption. On the other hand, extracting the information in a programmatic way is not easy.\n\nMy suggestions:\n\nUsing the JSON Schema description annotation to describe what each OpenAPI schema object is.\n\nBecause I see that maintenance cost is the reason why descriptions were removed, why not use the JSON Schema as the source of truth? Then, the sections of the spec could be programmatically generated from the information on the schema, avoiding maintaining two separate documents.\n\nI might, obviously, be missing many other details. However, I wanted to share my opinion in case anyone finds it interesting.\n\nPermalink: 20241119151234\n\nFound at “Causal Islands Berlin 2024” on 2024-11-19 15:12:34 +01:00.\n\nCausal Islands is a conference about the future of computing and a home for new perspectives ranging from deeply technical insights to sharp socio-political analysis.\n\nPermalink: 20241119124718\n\nHow do AI agents identify themselves when consuming APIs?

The idea is to have a multi-dimensional model that includes what the Richardson and Amundsen (PDF) models offer, adding other layers.\n\nAnother view gives importance to the functional interface. There’s no quality if the API doesn’t offer what consumers need. Or, in short, quality is tied to usability. To achieve that, there are aspects such as consistency of interface, and semantic clarity, that should be taken into account. I still see this type of quality as technical.\n\nSome answers connect quality to governance and point out that it’s often not easy to convince people the two are tied. Things like linting, having rules that enforce consistency and naming, and making sure APIs use the right architecture and types of operations are part of this line of thought.\n\nPermalink: 20241107223940\n\nAlan Kay refers to the “Creative Magic” as “Good Woowoo.” (20240306160214)\n\nPermalink: 20241107162227\n\nAccording to Seth Godin, there are three kinds of quality:\n\nTechnical.\n\nLuxury.\n\nCreative magic.\n\nHaving technical quality means things work according to specs.
