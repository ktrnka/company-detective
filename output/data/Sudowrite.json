The company was founded in 2020 by Amit Gupta and James Yu, both of whom are science fiction writers. Sudowrite is headquartered in San Francisco, California [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sudowrite).\n\nSudowrite offers a suite of AI-driven writing tools that assist authors in various aspects of the writing process. These tools include text generation, plagiarism prevention, multilingual support, and community engagement features. The platform is particularly popular among novelists, screenwriters, and short story writers, with over 12,000 users reported as of 2024 [(Jamie Giggs, Blogging Wizard, 2024-03-15)](https://bloggingwizard.com/sudowrite-review/).\n\nThe company operates on a subscription model, offering several plans to cater to different user needs. These include the Hobby & Student Plan at $10/month, the Professional Plan at $22/month, and the Max Plan at $44/month, all billed annually [(Lolade, 2024-12-06)](https://autogpt.net/sudowrite-review-a-writers-best-friend/).\n\nSudowrite's products are distributed online, and the company fosters a vibrant community through platforms like Slack and Discord, where users can share experiences and collaborate on projects [(Jamie Giggs, Blogging Wizard, 2024-03-15)](https://bloggingwizard.com/sudowrite-review/).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Amit Gupta**: Co-founder of Sudowrite, Amit is a science fiction writer with a background in entrepreneurship. He is actively involved in the development and community engagement aspects of the company.\n  \n- **James Yu**: Co-founder of Sudowrite, James also has a background in science fiction writing and technology.

We claim no rights over anything you put into Sudowrite, nor anything Sudowrite generates for you.\n\nCan Sudowrite plagiarize? The short answer is, Sudowrite won't plagiarize unless you explicitly force it to plagiarize, which is against our terms of service.\n\nThe AI works by guessing one word at a time, based on general concepts it has learned from billions of samples of text. So it's extremely unlikely to produce the same words verbatim, or even ever again.

As long as your own writing is original, you'll get more original writing out of Sudowrite. We encourage you to try plagiarism checkers to verify your results.\n\nIs this cheating? Sudowrite is a tool for creativity. It's not intended to write for you, but can help you vastly improve and speed up your writing. Just as a great writing partner can help you bust through when you're stuck or be a sounding board to bounce ideas off of, Sudowrite makes writing more fun, faster, and less solitary.\n\nWhat public language models does Sudowrite use? We use over two dozen AI models, including Claude 2 by Anthropic, multiple open models, and several variants of GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, transformer models created by OpenAI. OpenAI trained their models on: (1) a version of the CommonCrawl dataset, filtered based on similarity to high-quality reference corpora, (2) an expanded version of the Webtext dataset, (3) two internet-based book corpora, and (4) English-language Wikipedia. We pair these models with a variety of proprietary narrative model-based and algorithmic pre- and post-processing to enable AI writing features not available anywhere else.\n\nDoes Sudowrite learn and improve from my writing? We are constantly listening to writers' feedback to improve Sudowrite. However, we do not use your writing to train Sudowrite or OpenAI's AI models.\n\nBefore I sign up, how do I cancel? It’s easy.

The idea of using AI and ML to generate text has been floating around since the '60s (shoutout to ELIZA). And the modern era of AI writing tools has been in full swing since the release of GPT-3 aaaall the way back\n\nHow to Write a Book with ChatGPT (+ a Better Alternative)\n\nIf you’re thinking about writing a book with AI, ChatGPT is probably pretty tempting. It’s free (or, at the very least, cheap), crazy smart, and able to adapt to any prompt you throw at it. Well… almost any prompt. If you head over to ChatGPT and write: * “Generate",

      "# [We’re hiring one amazing human to lead community at Sudowrite](https://editor.sudowrite.com/jobs-community/)\nDo you love community strategy & metrics as much as you love writing? Are you energized by helping, welcoming, and empowering others? Then read on...\n\nAI: It’ll either kill us all or create a utopian renaissance situation like the world has never seen.\n\nWe’re working really hard to make sure it’s the latter.\n\nWe make this thing called Sudowrite. It’s the best tool for long-form writers ever made. Over 8,000 authors use it to publish novels, screenplays, short stories, and lots of other things.\n\nOur writers tell us it helps them write 2-3× as fast, get unblocked, and finish novels that had languished for years. If G.R.R. Martin had this thing, book six would have been out years ago.\n\nWe’re growing fast. We 5Xed revenue and customers in the last six months. We have something real here.\n\nWe’re 💥 profitable 💥. We’ve hit product-market fit and now we’re just trying to keep up with demand. Our team is small (just 5) and we’re all really good at what we do. We’ve been featured in The New Yorker and lots of other places you’ve heard of. Just last month, a book written using Sudowrite was reviewed in the New York Times.\n\nOur company was started by repeat founders, both writers, both down-to-earth, decent people with prior exits. Our investors aren’t too shabby, either.\n\nIf you’ve played the startup game before, you know that nothing in life is certain. That said, we have strong fundamentals, we believe AI is here to stay, and our business is working.\n\nOur community is core to our success. In fact, the vast majority of people find us through word of mouth.\n\nAuthors hear about us in discords and slacks and facebook groups and subreddits. We have a friendly Slack community with over 3,500 people. Every day, members help each other learn how to use the Sudowrite.\n\nWe have a fledgling ambassadors program with volunteers from all over the world. They hold Zoom sessions to help other authors, answer questions in Slack, and document best practices. They are amazing.\n\nWe also build features with dozens and sometimes hundreds of community members giving feedback directly to our product team. We talk to and learn from our customers daily.\n\nCommunity isn’t a nice-to-have, it’s part of our product.\n\nWe want our community to become THE reason people choose to join Sudowrite. We want a supportive, ambitious, and vibrant community that is as much the product as the app itself.\n\nThese days, Ryan (our designer) runs weekly community calls, teaches classes on how to use Sudowrite, and works with our ambassadors.\n\nJames (one of our founders) and Josh (one of our engineers) worked closely with hundreds of community testers to build our newest feature.\n\nAmit (the other founder) actively answers questions about sudowrite on reddit and facebook, and is helping with ambassadors.\n\nAnd all of us actively answer questions in the community Slack and solicit feedback.\n\nWe believe a stronger community = a stronger business\n\nWe believe great stories change minds & thus change the world.\n\nWe believe tools like Sudowrite are enabling a creative renaissance.\n\nWe believe learning from and supporting each other is the key to making this all work.\n\nWe believe a stronger community directly leads to a stronger business.\n\nHere’s where\n\nyou come in…\n\nWe want a visionary, compassionate, detail-oriented do-er who can own all aspects of community. Someone who loves trying new things, moves quickly, and wakes up each morning energized by this stuff.\n\nRight now, we believe community encompasses talking with current and future customers, content marketing, and program management, but this may evolve as we learn more about what our community members need most.\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nWork directly with our founders to create, then own our community strategy\n\nEstablish and monitor key metrics + reporting systems representing our community health\n\nGrow our community and optimize the funnel from community to customer\n\nOversee and improve our educational system - including live classes and youtube videos\n\nOversee content - including docs, blogs, emails, and collaborating with external content creators\n\nGrow our ambassador program - empowering our best writers to share their gifts\n\nFacilitate community involvement in product decisions\n\nMaintain a great vibe in our community spaces\n\nMaintain presence wherever writers talk about us - facebook, discords, subreddits, etc. (up for discussion)\n\nThis is your dream job if you…\n\nLive and breathe community and care deeply about people\n\nBring a quantitative mindset to community growth\n\nLove to set and deliver on ambitious goals\n\nLove to write and have participated in writer communities\n\nAre motivated by our mission and vision for the future\n\nAre able to manage multiple projects with high attention to detail\n\nRequired experience\n\n4-6 years of community experience\n\nExperience growing an early customer base or community\n\nThings you may have done\n\nBuilt an online community with over 1000 members\n\nRun online or in-person events\n\nOperated a writing community, workshop, or taught writing\n\nBeen part of the early growth stage of a successful startup in a growth, marketing, product, community management, or operations role\n\nOther things to know\n\nRemote-first- We’re fully and unapologetically remote. Heck, no two people even live in the same city. We meet up a few times a year, the last few times in Yosemite 🏞 , the Hudson valley 🗽, and Hawaii 🌴. We hang out on Zoom on Thursdays and have a monthly book club.\n\nWork-life balance- We don’t expect you to spend 80 hours a week at your desk, and we don’t plan to, either. Sometimes things get busy, but it shouldn’t be the norm. We have lives outside of work, and we want you to as well.\n\nCompetitive compensation & benefits- We’ll pay you 110K base salary and 0.4% equity or $80K salary and 0.5% equity. We’ll help you set up your home office, and you’ll have good health and dental insurance and unlimited paid time off (vacation, sick, holidays). Also, all the books you want.\n\nOkay, you got me. How do I apply?\n\nstep 1: Email us at community@sudowrite.com . Tell us why this is your dream job, why you’re our dream community person, and send us any relevant work.\n\nstep 2: We’ll carefully review your application and either do a 30 minute call or kindly thank you for applying and feel really bad if it’s not a fit but that’s just how it goes sometimes.\n\nstep 3: If we’re both into it, you’ll do a short assignment\n\nstep 4: We’ll chat with your references\n\nstep 5: You’ll meet the rest of the team over Zoom\n\nstep 6: 🎉\n\nWe can’t wait to meet you!"

I mean, there's the one mentioned already but I found out you have to use a personal API key and there's more stuff to it. Kinda turned me off because I just want to get in and write. Have you tried the cheaper models on Sudowrite? Claude Haiku is pretty good with instructions and has a cheaper cost. While Mistral is also good with instructions but needs a bit more editing. If I remember right, they also have a quick chat (Chat GPT 3.5 which is free in the app itself, so you don't have to work outside the app).\n\n## Comment ID ldef2r9 with +3 score by [(killerdinodeeno, Reddit, 2024-07-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/ldef2r9/) (in reply to ID 1e47dyi):\nAll in all, it’s about the same amount of effort to get set up to write between Sudowrite and NovelCrafter. If you think about what goes into SW from the perspective of setting up the beats, etc. Neither produce great prose right out of the gate. But yeah, from a UI perspective (plug and play) SW is better for beginners. \n\nPersonally, I switched from SW to NC about a year ago because I was tired of wasting my monthly credits on prose that wasn’t useable. NC with the API key though OpenRouter (so it’s just 1 key) lets me play with so so many different models. And NC let’s you customize prompts, wheat SW doesn’t. I like having that level of control. Once you get used to it, I’ve found it to be much better and cheaper than SW. That’s just my opinion, though. I definitely encourage anyone who is new to AI tools to try them out and see what works for you and your process.\n\n### Comment ID ldehxh5 with +1 score by [(ecchirhino99, Reddit, 2024-07-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/ldehxh5/) (in reply to ID ldef2r9):\nTo use novelcrafter to chat edit(review) a scene you need tier 3 subscription artisan tier?

Tier 3 gives you additional features like Workshop. I'm not sure what all that is, as I've been using NC since it was in beta and got access to the paid version right when it was released. \n\nMost people use OpenRouter for the credits, and the price per model is set by them/the LLM provider (NC has no control over model prices). Some models are more expensive than others, like Claude Opus, but there are lots of free models available on OpenRouter as well.\n\n## Comment ID ldex7y1 with +3 score by [(PiccoloGold3510, Reddit, 2024-07-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/ldex7y1/) (in reply to ID 1e47dyi):\nThere’s nothing wrong with SudoWrite, but it really depends what you’re trying to do.\n\nTools like NovelCrafter are more expensive for a reason. $14/mo is reasonable for a powerful tool that has a lively community of authors that use it as a daily driver. It’s a workhorse, and they are always working on updates that people actually want.\n\nAt the same time, if you’re not ready to take the plunge, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with just using TypingMind and connect it to your OpenRouter account. If you’re just inserting beats into an existing scene, chat might be all you need.\n\nAlso consider the possibility that if what you really want is fresh, original, truly creative writing that the world has never seen before, written in a voice that is all your own, then you’re going to have to write it yourself. The cost is your time and maybe some overdue fees at the library.\n\n### Comment ID ldfuq2o with +3 score by [(ecchirhino99, Reddit, 2024-07-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/ldfuq2o/) (in reply to ID ldex7y1):\nWhile testing novelcrafter, I can see now that sudowrite cost of prompts seem to be inflated to the extreme. I can generate responses using the same ai models at a fraction of the cost. \nTho sudowrite interface is excellent and my only gripe with it is the limited text boxes.\n\nI write mainly about world building related staff so I use ai a lot to generate scene to introduce those concepts I design.\nAlso I will always let an ai to go over the wording choices to  improve the writing quality.\n\n## Comment ID ldki7t0 with +1 score by [(shimmerbby, Reddit, 2024-07-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/ldki7t0/) (in reply to ID 1e47dyi):\nNovelcrafter is the next best thing out there tbh.\n\n## Comment ID lut0gnf with +1 score by [(No_Honeydew1716, Reddit, 2024-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/lut0gnf/) (in reply to ID 1e47dyi):\nAlguém sabe um site que é parecido com sudowrite só que de graça??

It is amazing for helping get my ideas and characters into a tight outline.\n\nBut I dispute that the content can pass for an actual novel or match tones. People get more and more heavily into complex headers and guardrails and style guide and beats and genre, but the output still has \"that AI feel\"--piercing blue eyes, tidy bows, affirmations, cliches, rushing through scenes, etc. \n\nI'm not aware of anything that has the same full-suite features and structures as Sudowrite. \n\nFor matching tones, NovelAi is the best and cheapest, because it is guided by what you write and picks up your tones and characterisation in a quite amazing way. And it lets you tinker a lot under the hood. But it doesn't help at all with structuring and plotting, which IMO is Sudo's strength.\n\nIt's possible that what would work for you best is a free LLM like LLama2 or CGPT for plotting and character sketches, and NA for actual writing (copy the character sketches into Lorebooks). Even the cheapest tier of NA had the highest level of context and unlimited generations with Clio, which is a pretty good model.\n\n#### Comment ID k3crgss with +2 score by [(NoYesterday7832, Reddit, 2023-10-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/k3crgss/) (in reply to ID k3codl8):\nHow are you doing that?

Whenever I ran the story stats, it was at least 85% my content. And that’s fine! But I was really looking for something that would take my prose and _run with it_, so I decided to try out Sudowrite. \n\nI literally only just got started, but already I’m feeling a bit _ugh_ about the whole thing. I spent around 3 hours creating all of my backstory, character definitions, example writing, etc. I was very specific about the perspective (‘I’ am the narrator, ‘you’ are the main character, as if I’m telling the story _to you_). \n\nImmediately, it got it wrong. It started writing in the first person for the wrong character. And despite giving it a decent example of my writing and style, it sounded absolutely nothing like me. So I paused it, intent on correcting it… and it just _kept going_. For minutes. It spat out around a thousand words before it finally decided to pause. \n\nI then spent another hour rewriting almost _all_ of that first block - changing the character perspective, rewriting big chunks of it, and then adding some of my own, carrying the story on (and following my predefined beats).\n\nI finally got to a good jumping-off point and inserted it over the previously-generated text, then hit ‘continue’…\n\n…and it just kicked off as if I’d done nothing. It started from exactly where I’d stopped it before, ignoring everything I’d written. It immediately jumped back to writing the character from the first-person (rather than the second), and with that same pulp-fiction prose that sounds nothing like me.\n\nI’ve used a fair few generative AI tools, and what I’m used to is them taking the backstory/permanent memory/definitions etc., and then the _context_ of what’s been written (like its ‘short-term memory’) to inform what it writes next. But Sudowrite seemed to just… ignore me?\n\nI assume I’m doing something wrong, but I’ve got no idea how to fix it. I know Sudowrite have a Discord, but I find group-chat apps way too _noisy_.\n\nHas anyone got any experience with this, and any tips on how to ~~shove~~ nudge it in the direction I want?\n\n## Comment ID kh99cvl with +5 score by [(ironic_cat555, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/kh99cvl/) (in reply to ID 193gi4w):\nIsn't I am the narrator and I'm telling the story to you second person?  If so a more detailed explanation than second person might just confuse it.\n\nIf you are using the story engine feature Sudowrite's story engine doesn't really have the ability to analyze your writing style.  When you upload your writing sample all it does is generate a description of your writing style.  Which means they pass that description on to the AI not your prose.   I don't know if generating prose in the chapter, kind of like NovelAI rather than in story engine would work better.\n\nStart off by generating small amounts of text (just 2 to 4 beats) and see if you can get it to work how you want it to.  Then it won't continue writing for a long time.\n\nAlso the discord has a lot of helpful people in it. \n\nThat said if you are usually doing SFW stuff you might be better off trying Claude 2.  At 100k or 200k contexts you can paste a huge writing sample and tell it to imitate your style.\n\n### Comment ID kha7mdd with +1 score by [(PartyMuffinButton, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/kha7mdd/) (in reply to ID kh99cvl):\nRe: POV - yes, but regardless it ignores how I’d defined the characters and their pronouns (it made the second character the first, and is ignoring corrections). \n\nI had a conversation with someone at sudowrite a few days ago and asked them about ‘Story Engine’ because I didn’t see it. He explained that it used to be a separate thing, but now they’ve bundled everything together, so Sudowrite _is_ story engine now, from what I can gather.\n\nI’ll try with shorter beats and see how it goes, but I think I’ve found a major flaw in how it generates stories, and I’m worried I might now be stuck without erasing everything and starting again (basically it iterates through ‘beats’ and when I go back and ~~rewrite everything~~ correct it, setting the story back a little bit, it both a) continues to ignore my style, and 2) gets confused about where it is.

Story engine is now the Chapter Generator feature.  But there's an alternative way to generate prose which is using the \"write\" \"rewrite\" \"describe\" buttons in the chapter text area.  That's the one more like Novel AI that I  meant.\n\nIf the story engine is screwing up just pause it, it'll only go to the end of the current two beats, then change the instructions in the beats then hit restart after deleting the bad prose and try again.  \"Most accurate\" is the ai most likely to follow your instructions.\n\n#### Comment ID khabap9 with +1 score by [(superamit, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/khabap9/) (in reply to ID kha7mdd):\nWere you putting \"Second-person POV\" in the style?

When I was using that tool, I actually did it the old-fashioned way with my story (or chapter) in a document and Write with some key details filled in. I liked that it would only write between 50-250 words (I could control that), and have a few different iterations I could choose and insert into the text. \nI haven't used Sudowrite in awhile though because after not looking at my story for a great while, I looked at my work and could tell it was AI-generated. Plus, after their pricing change, I (not on an active subscription), seem to have lost all the words from my extra pack I'd bought back when I was on Max.

I had one killing off toddlers at a birthday party. I've tested with even their \"censored\" models - Anthropic and OpenAI - and those will work as long as there is no sexual content. The thing you will have to watch is wording in other boxes that could cause potential issues.\n\nFor example, I write dark mafia romance. Let's say in my genre box I have something with drugs or alcohol to indicate the boss's business, and I have something about writing graphic sexual details in my style box because I will have intimate scenes. Normally, you want to keep these up-to-date with the chapter or scene you are writing, but pretend I forgot to change those things. Now I'm going to write a scene involving a character's minor child, that could trigger because I've mentioned those things (drugs, alcohol, or sexual descriptions) for how the prose should be written. Take that wording out, and it's good to go. \n\nI have two series that involve human trafficking and one with minors. As long as I'm only talking about them being taken or hurt (not sexually), it will generate. If I need to generate the harsher aspect, I need to change the ages of the minors for that scene.\n\n\n\n### Comment ID k20s62o with +1 score by [(Thewrightrae_5591, Reddit, 2023-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/k20s62o/) (in reply to ID jbeiceb):\nI subscribed to Sudowrite last week.

There isn't any law in the US concerning explicit sex or any fictional depiction of violence or sex. That said, just because you write it doesn't mean anyone will read it. Major books, including the bible, feature incest, rape, and child brides. There is zero reason why software in the US should censor the written word. This is being done to prevent some lawsuit against the company, but don't quote the censorship as needing to comply with the law. There are some obscenity laws in certain states, but these only become an issue when an offensive work is widely commercialized. Some erotica and kink writers write for very small closed-loop audiences (PERFECTLY LEGAL). \"Distasteful\" doesn't constitute a violation of the law.\n\n## Comment ID kzsleep with +1 score by [(juken7, Reddit, 2024-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/kzsleep/) (in reply to ID 11lthuu):\nThanks for the info was about try the service even tho it's really expensive but know that I know will look for a better censor free A.I editor...\n\n## Comment ID lkjd9tb with +1 score by [(Entire-Adeptness9407, Reddit, 2024-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/lkjd9tb/) (in reply to ID 11lthuu):\nOk so I got similar issue first time it happened was when Warcraft was mentioned in the story, second time was when a woman threatened to cut someone's balls off, I have mostly steered away from violence and this wasn't really violence, just a threat\n\n## Comment ID lkjrwnr with +1 score by [(Entire-Adeptness9407, Reddit, 2024-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/lkjrwnr/) (in reply to ID 11lthuu):\nOk I started using Sudowrite, because it promoted itself for being uncensored, but lately it hasn't been the case\n\n## Comment ID lyf0hrn with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-11-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/lyf0hrn/) (in reply to ID 11lthuu):\nWith sudo wrote you need to be crystal clear bc it follows this algorithm, girl=below 18 yrs old, female adult or 28 yr old female adult,l=adult, and thr like yes despite the cage being given as 28 yr old girl  the term girl indicates below puberty as that is how the algorithm of these writing software work, I krefer using hyperwrite for safety uses bur if you want unfiltered and unadulterated content yiu may have to use Toolbaz instead make sure thst your ad blocker is off but thr max word count is 300 words so you may have to rely on your own mind and all unfortunately reas books how to wrote stories buy them from Amazon so yiu have a way to understand what and how to write I Blame grade school for getting rid of the graduation writing test requirements bc you are given a topic sentence and then have to wrote 3-5page essay using sole sentence have the sentence in every paragraph of the essay, the 3-5 pages is front and back of one page equals one page then you may been able to write better stories and all.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID jdforhb with +1 score by [(Rekard_Volfey, Reddit, 2023-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/jdforhb/) (in reply to ID 11lthuu):\nSudowrite wrote some erotica for me.

It allowed for some pretty cool stuff. \n\nThen I switched to NovelAI and liked it a LOT better. It was far easier to use it as a writing assistant without needing convoluted prompts. \n\nThen I started using GPT-3 directly in the playground. I found myself mostly using the playground vs NovelAI. It was likely more expensive (pay per use rather than monthly) but I found the results were MUCH better - especially with short prompts (I had the playground write a beat sheet for a novel without any further explanation and it did a good job!)\n\nI tried Goose playground as well and found it was a lot weaker. \n\nMore recently I have been using Sudowrite. I have been VERY impressed.

I get that Sudowrite can feel a bit like a maze at first, and running low on credits doesn't help. Transparent talk first. I'm an ambassador for them. So, Sudowrite packs in a ton of features to boost your writing, which can be a lot to take in. Here's a quick guide to help you organize your chapter ideas:\n\n**Editor**: This is your main writing area, much like Google Docs or Word. Draft your chapters here.\n\n**Story Engine**: Great for plotting out your novel. You can dump your story ideas, set the genre and style, and let it help craft a synopsis. It also aids in building characters and outlines. \n\n**Story Bible**: Think of this as your reference guide for all story elements like characters, settings, plot points etc to keep everything consistent.\n\n**Plugins:** Sudowrite offers plugins to add new features without needing to code. These can introduce fresh ways to write, edit, and analyze your work. \n\nCheck out the \"[Quick Start](https://docs.sudowrite.com/getting-started/dQph1snuwbfMWG9wRjsNug/quick-start/2A4FjtiocrtxHPUyz6WZgR)\" guide. It gives an overview of Sudowrite’s interface and tools in under 11 minutes. \n\nSo those credits... Sudowrite uses a credit system; each AI feature uses up some credits. To make the most of them you need to know that different features eat different amounts of credits. For example, generating longer passages with a full Character Cast or having thick entries in Worldbuilding or using the latest AI models might use more credits. But there are cheaper AI models that write almost as good and cost next to nothing like GPT 4o Mini. \n\nBuy Extra Credits if Needed: If you run out but want to keep going, you can buy one-time extra credits. These don't expire and stay with your account until used. \n\nAlso, \"Quick Tools\" like Quick Edit and Quick Chat are included with your subscription and don't use credits unless you switch on High Quality mode. \n\nIf you need more help, feel free to ask.

And good luck if you need help with intimate scenes or a bar fight or shootout. \n\nSudowrite is a great place to start if you have a basic idea of what you like in a story. They have loads of toys to play with where you plug in a basic idea for a character, place, or story and see what it will create, tweak it a little, and keep going. Play for a few days and you’ll have a story, maybe not the best story ever, but it’s fun to try and who knows, maybe you’ll like something enough to keep revising it.\n\nNovelcrafter is better if you like to build worlds, different timelines, multiple character arcs, series, and really need a fine level of control. It’s usable out of the box, but you’ll get the most out of it if you are good at prompting - they have some built-in prompts that you’ll want to start modifying once you’ve got the hang of it. Where people get stuck is with guiding an ai beat-by-beat. It helps if you have prior experience with scene composition, but that’s something you can learn with trial and error - or look into Story Grid… loads of guidance out there, really.\n\nMost novel-writing apps have some form of plot-grid and linked elements, and that’s true for both SudoWrite and NovelCrafter.\n\nIf you have no idea what I’m talking about, just pick one or both and start tinkering. It takes 2-3 months of experimenting and actually talking to other writers before you can get a clear sense of the potential and limitations.\n\n## Comment ID lq8bznb with +10 score by [(ZobeidZuma, Reddit, 2024-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1fvkbhr/what_does_sudowrite_and_novelcrafter_actually_do/lq8bznb/) (in reply to ID 1fvkbhr):\nSudowrite and Novelcrafter actually work pretty differently.\n\nSudowrite has its own LMM which they supposedly optimize for generating prose.  It's all invisible to the user.\n\nNovelcrafter lets you connect to Openrouter and then choose from—and experiment with—a wide range of LMMs.\n\nThey also take different approaches to organization.  In fact, Novelcrafter organizes the story development process so well that I think it would be very useful even if I never connected or used the AI features.  It's sort of filling a similar role that Scrivener has for many years, and Scrivener has a lot of fans among authors.\n\nI haven't used Scrivener for years, but at this point I'd pick Novecrafter for being simpler to use (the Scrivener interface has mutated into a bit of a monster over the years) and for being totally cross-platform (as a web-based application).\n\n## Comment ID lq8ry53 with +3 score by [(Clueless_Nooblet, Reddit, 2024-10-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1fvkbhr/what_does_sudowrite_and_novelcrafter_actually_do/lq8ry53/) (in reply to ID 1fvkbhr):\nThey provide a writing interface that displays outputs from an LLM.

You can use tools like ChatGPT or Claude directly to help with editing, generating ideas, creating outlines, and reviewing your work. These book-writing apps aim to streamline the process, offering built-in prompts and automation to enhance your workflow.\n\nI used to rely on a combination of Scrivener, Obsidian, and ChatGPT Plus with custom GPTs for my writing, but it became overly complex. In particular, Scrivener often felt too intricate for my needs. That’s why I developed a new app to automate the workflow for drafting a book. It generates outlines, helps you write directly to those outlines, and can even create a first draft or enhance your writing in the style you specify.\n\nIf you’re interested in trying it out, the app is available for free on the App Store or as a web app at [wababai.com](http://wababai.com)\n\nIt integrates OpenAI so you don’t need to worry about setup, and there’s a paid option for tasks requiring heavy API use. However, many AI-powered features are free for users.\n\nHope this helps!",

The difference is that Novelcrafter’s “Codex” (the equivalent of Sudowrite’s “Story Bible”), Scene summaries and all other things you can pre-establish, are considerably more flexible and, to some extent, Novelcrafter “expects” you to use them to guide the generation.

I've got it working pretty well here.  Maybe I can offer some suggestions.\n\nIt's important to understand which codex entries are visible to the AI.  Your characters, for example. . .  When you create a new codex entry and select \"character\" type, it should *track* that entry.  What that means is, if NC sees that character name in your prompt, then it'll provide that codex entry to the LLM.  It'll become part of the context for that scene.  So when you are writing your prompt for a scene beat, you should mention all the characters who are present in that scene *by name*.  You may have dozens of characters in your story, but NC will only show the LLM its cards for the ones that you mentioned in the prompt.  That keeps the LLM from being overwhelmed with too much information that's not relevant.\n\nYou can go into the **Plan** tab and then the **Matrix** view, and Novelcrafter will show you a grid with all the characters it's tracking, and which scenes they appear in.\n\nRaces. . .  Let's say you have a race of \"gnomes\" in your story.  If you haven't mentioned the word \"gnome\" in your prompt, the LLM might never get the info.  There are a couple of ways to fix this.  One is to go into the entries for your gnome characters and give each of them a Nested Reference to the gnome race.  Then, any time one of those characters gets pulled into the context, the card on gnomes gets pulled in too.  You can also do that with factions that various characters are members of, etc.\n\nIn each codex entry you can find a tab called **References** and a couple of options under **REFERENCE TRACKING**.  One option you can check is \"Always include this entry in the AI context.\"  If you switch that on, then the card will *always* be visible to the LLM.  You want to use this for things like genre and style that always apply to every part of your story.  You can also use it for important bits of lore.  The only reason not to over-use it is, like I said, to not overwhelm the LLM with the entire contents of your Codex and stuff that's not relevant to the task.\n\nAll of the *scene summaries* are also part of the LLM context!  That means keeping your scene summaries up-to-date is super helpful to the AI knowing where it is and what it's doing.  You can get your choice of AI to write those summaries for you, so there's no excuse.  Once you have a scene completed to your satisfaction, with a few clicks you can have the AI reading it and writing a summary of the important events, which then becomes part of its knowledge base for generating future scenes.\n\nIf you are set up with OpenRouter, you have a lot of LLMs available, and you can experiment freely.  However. . .  In my experience there are only a few that give top results.  ChatGPT is always reliable.  At this moment, Claude was recently updated and produces the very best output.  Claude has become pretty smart, and if he is routinely getting confused, it almost certainly means that he's not getting the context he needs from Novelcrafter.\n\n## Comment ID krrh7w8 with +5 score by [(MeridianASK, Reddit, 2024-02-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/krrh7w8/) (in reply to ID 1akj00y):\nDon't use any of them.

It only works on the desktop version but it has an upload button to get your document in the chat and you can use an openrouter API to use free models all though they won't support as huge of a context. \nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xHY3OHUNOrQ&pp=ygUQT2JzaWRpYW4gY29waWxvdA%3D%3D\n\n## Comment ID kpb7cla with +3 score by [(21limo, Reddit, 2024-02-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/kpb7cla/) (in reply to ID 1akj00y):\nSudowrite is really impressive but monetize method is really greedy. I'd be happy to subscribe if there weren't a words limit.

I didn't think the pricing was terrible.  My issue was the ai really didn't do a good job of using the input that I added to craft the story.  You have the option to add character descriptions.  You could spend lots of time fleshing all that out and then randomly the ai will insert a character that isn't in the list.  It also disregards any information.  I described one character as bald and the ai kept trying to add in \"ran his hand through his hair\"\n\n### Comment ID l9y5k8k with +6 score by [(I_CHING_READING, Reddit, 2024-06-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/l9y5k8k/) (in reply to ID kqe5m9u):\nObviously he keeps his hair in a little pouch.

Novelcrafter is great with OpenRouter, and allows you to use a shitload of models - but Sudowrite has a good spread of them too. \n\nOverall, I'd say **NovelAI** is the best all-rounder. It's cheaper for heavy users since there's no character limit, but you do sometimes need to get a little more into the settings and lore memory to get results you like. But it's fast, flexible, has a nice UI, and will let you type 24/7 for as long as you like. \n\n**Novelcrafter** is a close second to **Sudowrite** for me. I really like Novelcrafter - Openrouter gets you a ton of versatility for really *cheap* - but frankly, 75% of those models aren't really going to see use. What's more, I've found it kind of difficult to use seamlessly with natural writing - though perhaps, I don't know enough.  My main gripes are that:   \n **1)** You have to break out of prose to do a / command for continuing the story - and it, *afaik,* doesn't do a very good job of reading previous text for context, and you have to write a blurb telling it what you want to do. With Sudowrite and Novelai, it's a keypress and it picks up where you left off seamlessly, letting you tweak from there.   \n**2)** You can generate one thing, with one model, at a time. One of my favorite things about Sudowrite is parallel generating *2 or more cards*. Plus, since fiddling with length is unintuitive in NC, you often end up with a long generation that veers off course in the middle, and you have to repeat **1)** again in the middle of your passage. \n\nSudowrite's biggest downside is that it's less flexible and customizable, and far more expensive per generation than Novelcrafter. \n\nI *want* to like Novelcrafter, but using it right now feels hard and unrewarding - writing the same thing in Sudowrite or Nai, I get much farther much faster than with Novelcrafter. \n\nPlease, do sell me on novelcrafter - I'd love to see it dethrone the others at that price point, but as it stands, I'm torn between NovelAi and Sudowrite.\n\n### Comment ID l6abrbj with +1 score by [(Dude_Man_Bro_Sir, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/l6abrbj/) (in reply to ID l6a4j3l):\nThank you for the detailed write up. I've alternated between NAI and NC since I posted this so I have some thoughts about the two tools.\n\nI agree with your points about NAI and NC.\n\nI like the way NAI produces output and is very fluid/natural with my own writing. NC, on the other hand, also provides chatbot functionality with the same models I picked for story generation (only the two models too) but the story generation is kind of clunky and needs instructions to produce content.\n\nConversely, I like NC's lore book, planning, and shelving system more than NAI's. NC allows you to create a series so you can group together different stories (or books) that occur in the same series. It can be entirely different stories or it can be a sequence of stories.\n\nWhile NAI does have a shelving system that also groups stories together, NC's system has the added benefit of making it so a lore entry can be book-level or series-level. So, you don't necessarily have to remake a lore entry if you make a new story with the same characters or in the same setting as the previous one. Unfortunately, NAI doesn't have that and you need to export it from the previous story and import it into the new story.\n\nNC also offers a more robust story planning system, where you can create a story outline with separate acts, chapters, and scenes. It has the benefit of making it easy to traverse your story if you need to go back to a different chapter or jump to the current one to continue typing.\n\nNAI puts it all into one document so if you want to separate the story into chapters, you can either create a new story in the shelf (and import the lore book) or separate the document into different chapters with \"Chapter 1\", etc, and then using CTRL + F to jump between chapters.\n\nI can't really say to use one over the other at this stage since both NC and NAI have their pros and cons still.\n\n#### Comment ID l6ahld7 with +3 score by [(waker1771, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/l6ahld7/) (in reply to ID l6abrbj):\nI think that NC is probably more useful for heavy outliners and those with a large-scale work in mind. It offers a lot more horsepower in that regard for sure. \n\nI'd be curious to hear your take on Sudowrite - I had hoped for a super clear-cut winner (don't we all?) in all this, so I could subscribe to one service alone without headache.   \n  \nUnfortunately, just like a lot of things, there's all sorts of pros and cons to weigh. \n\nI'd say my final breakdown looks something like this:   \n  \n**Sudowrite** is best in class for high-volume, quality output with minimal tweaking, and a useful, very intuitive writing toolset. But, you lose fine model control, some flexibility, and it's more costly. So if you want to fully realize an idea fully the fastest, and/or get more AI assistance, it's a winner.\n\n**Novelcrafter** gives very robust planning, lore, and outline tools, chat functions, and unmatched model availability for a low cost, but you lose that speedy workflow and high, multi-generation output. If you want to write a full-length novel in a large, cohesive universe, albeit with slightly less AI assistance, it's a great fit. \n\n**NovelAI** is a great all-rounder and adapts to style very well. It's snappy, reliable, and flexible; with unlimited generation. But, you may need to tinker a bit more than others, and there's no matching Openrouter's model breadth. Less high-volume than Sudowrite, but more than NC. If you're looking for reliable, strong writing with a high degree of output control, look no further.   \n  \nPersonally, I think NAI is starting to fall behind SW and NC with their access to newer, cutting edge LLM models, since NAI develops their own. For pros, NAI really manages to avoid the common AI phrasing and repetition pitfalls, feels more authentic and original, and is better at adapting to author style. As a con, though, it is a bit slower to adapt when there's large leaps made.\n\n## Comment ID kz7511s with +1 score by [(MnG_FGO_GT, Reddit, 2024-04-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/kz7511s/) (in reply to ID 1akj00y):\nI want to ask something.

A peer recommended NovelAI so I switch to this. So far it's great but I was wondering if there is a config similar to how Sudowrite generate ideas. for example, Sudowrite by default tends to be more expressive. I've set the config preset output to 220 characters already and yet the text generated is almost always around 50-70 characters or less. \n\n\n\n## Comment ID lgkbc7c with +16 score by [(FoldedDice, Reddit, 2024-08-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/1ekf637/is_there_a_way_to_make_novelai_similar_to/lgkbc7c/) (in reply to ID 1ekf637):\nI've always found NAI to be very expressive, but in my experience it's more in how you interact with it than in what settings you choose. That's tricky to offer advice for since a lot of it is just about having the right kind of gut feeling to play into the AI's strength, and the the only way to get that is through the experience of using it.\n\nIn particular to the output length, I don't try to extend past the default, but instead I just generate multiple times if I feel like the AI is hitting a good vibe. There are a number of things which are only reevaluated when a new generation starts (chief among them being lorebook keys), so my impression is that the quality of long outputs tends to degrade severely over time.\n\n## Comment ID lgnijn0 with +3 score by [(whywhatwhenwhoops, Reddit, 2024-08-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/1ekf637/is_there_a_way_to_make_novelai_similar_to/lgnijn0/) (in reply to ID 1ekf637):\nWhat do mean by a config more like sudowrite?

What I mean is, in NovelAi you have memory, author's note, lorebook, and different config presets. Depending how well you use the previous 4 things together the quality of the output varies massively. On top of that, you have instructs to push the AI even more into a specific direction.

Author is self-explanatory (just needs to be well-known enough that the model gets the reference). Title can be anything that sort of conveys the feel or topic. Tags can be words or phrases that convey themes and concepts you want in the story, comma-delineated if you want to use multiple, just don't go overboard). And Genre should be a well-established genre term, such as the lists of literary genres found on Wikipedia or Amazon.\n\nYou can leave out fields you don't want to use, just maintain the format (spaces between the brackets and the tag line, and each field separated by semicolons).\n\nStyle is fairly flexible. It should be a comma-delineated list of words or phrases (like Tags), but more about the kind of writing you want to see. There are trained in phrases (such as \"prose\", \"complex\", etc...), but many words will work (\"descriptive\", \"sensory\", etc...). [Here are some examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/18corhv/style_tags_for_sensory_language/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) of sensory language tags, but there is no fixed list, so feel free to experiment with soemthing that you think might fit your story.\n\nEdit: Beyond that, play around with different config presets, maybe try out some of the community ones from Discord. Between all of these, you can get extremely evocative writing that puts pretty much any other AI to shame. \"Logic\" is still a weak point though.\n\n## Comment ID lgtkws3 with +2 score by [(bobsburger4776, Reddit, 2024-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/1ekf637/is_there_a_way_to_make_novelai_similar_to/lgtkws3/) (in reply to ID 1ekf637):\nIs sudowrtie completely uncensored now?

It’s a great way to get a ton of value. Plus, Sudowrite's Quick Tools, like *Quick Edit* and *Quick Chat*, are *unlimited* and included free with the plans. I'm always using them to make light edits or have a chat directly within my document, making the writing process smoother and more integrated.\n\nHere's an example of prose generated using your sentence starter with the Chat4o Mini model:\n\n>She inspects the hammer with careful precision, her fingers lightly tracing the worn wooden handle. It had seen better days—splintered at the edge, coated in a fine layer of dust that hinted at years of neglect. But it was its head that intrigued her most. The metal glinted under the flickering fluorescent light, marred by splotches of something dark and unidentifiable.\n\n>Marjorie glanced around the cramped workshop, the air thick with the scent of rust and old wood. The walls were lined with tools of all kinds, each one telling a story she was desperate to unravel. But this hammer… it felt crucial. The sound of distant sirens echoed through the open window. Time was running out.\n\n>Her heart raced as she replayed the events of the night before—the confrontation with Richard, his wild accusations, then that chilling silence when he’d stormed out into the rain. She had thought it was just another argument, another moment lost in their spiraling relationship. But now? Now she understood there was something darker at play.\n\n>She slipped a small flashlight from her pocket and directed its beam onto the workbench beside her. There, half-hidden beneath a pile of scrap metal, lay a crumpled piece of paper. Instinct told her to be cautious, but curiosity drove her closer. As she extended her hand, her eyes caught more stains on the floor—ominous dark patches that trailed from the bench to the back door.\n\n>Was Richard here? Or had someone else entered this place during their fight? The questions ignited a fire in her gut that made her pulse quicken. Marjorie hesitated only a moment longer before unfolding the paper, every creak and crinkle seeming thunderous in the tense air around her.\n\n>Words began to form —a name scrawled hastily across the top: Arthur Blackwood. Her breath hitched in her throat as realization dawned; Arthur—the man who had disappeared without a trace two weeks prior. She had assumed he was simply another casualty in their chaotic town, but this suggested otherwise.\n\n>The sirens grew louder, pulling her from thoughts spiraling into darkness. She had to move—had to find out what connection this hammer, and those stains held to Arthur's fate before someone else made their way through that door behind her and erased everything once and for all."

      "# [A neural net wrote my book. Kidding. Sort of. by leanneleeds.com on 2021-06-02](https://leanneleeds.com/artificial-intelligence-in-fiction/)\nThis FAQ has been getting missed in a big way, so I’m moving it up to the front.\n\n(Moved and updated 6-12-2024)\n\nIn June 2021, I began working with Sudowrite, an AI writing assistant for fiction writers. And by “working with,” I mean I started using the software. In July of 2022, I was featured fairly prominently in How independent writers are turning to AI – The Verge, but because they primarily used my real name (Jennifer Lepp) instead of my pen name (Leanne Leeds,) no one paid me much notice. AI use in fiction was getting far less attention than art-generating AI.\n\nAnd then ChatGPT blew that all to hell. (I did a follow-up interview on that, too though my pen name was a bit more prominently pointed out thanks to my complaint about my real name use.\n\nI didn’t think that one through.)\n\nAt this point, I’m seeing some things mentioned about me that are pretty inaccurate I felt the need to put this up. So, here we go.\n\nI read somewhere that you use AI/ChatGPT to generate all your books now.\n\nYep, I read that, too.\n\nWhen this all started, I didn’t honestly know how much of the AI-generated text I actually used because I just went with the flow and didn’t have too big a concern with keeping track. As this became a hotter and hotter topic (and I’ve seen statements from folks claiming I “generate” my books or have the AI “create” them,) I got curious, so I used PostSEO text compare to compare my finished chapter and the text that was generated by the AI in my session.\n\nThe following is a screenshot of the chapter I wrote yesterday, and this seems to be pretty average. I’ve had results as low as 8%, and as high as 11%. On average, 90% are the words from my brain, and 10% are the words from the #AI.\n\nI do not use AI for plot suggestions as some do—I know where my chapters and scenes are going, I use AI to phrase things better.\n\nWhat part of your books does ChatGPT write?\n\nNone. Almost all words in my books (the 10% above) are from Anthropic’s Claude.\n\nDo you write faster with AI? I read that you use AI to write fast.\n\nI read that, too (and said it was my goal before I read it.) Unfortunately, no. It still takes me six-seven weeks to write a book. I did not get any speed gain out of AI use because I still pretty much write the book. I just incorporate different aids to keep me moving or vary phrasings/ways to say things, Anthropic’s Claude being the predominant one.\n\nDo you teach people to use AI?\n\nI do not work for any AI company. Sudowrite did pay me to write a few blog posts sharing some of my tips and tricks while they looked for and hired a Community Leader, but I have never specifically taught any class or worked as an instructor for pay with regard to AI. My primary occupation is fiction writing, and that’s what I do for a living.\n\nYou’re a plagiarist! (Or you’re not a real writer, you’re cheating, and so on and so on)\n\nI personally don’t feel that AI companies are doing anything legally wrong, and I’m comfortable using artificial intelligence in my creative endeavors. I’m comfortable with the fact that I’m still a writer. I realize other people feel differently, and I respect that viewpoint and people’s choice not to use it or patronize people that do use it. Don’t buy my books if you hate all these things so much it makes you grind your teeth—any book that AI was used to edit has a statement to that effect in the book so readers can be informed.\n\nI am also, though, aware that this is a new frontier, and a court may decide to make some new law/update the law/re-explain the law in a way that it applies here, so I’ll be watching just like everyone else and will make changes in my own use if/when needed.\n\nTools I currently use:\n\nThis is current as of 11/10/2024.\n\nNovelCrafter – this software is exactly what I was looking for without AI. The Codex is game changing for me, the type of story bible ease I’ve been looking for. In fact, I only use the Codex, but you can use this with AI.\n\nQuillbot – to quickly rephrase sentences/as a thesaurus on a per sentence editing basis.\n\nAnthropic’s Claude – for fiction revising and rephrasing.\n\nGoogle’s NotebookLM – for querying my series.\n\nLitRPG Adventures – for fantasy locations and characters\n\nScribeShadow – Novel translations.\n\nTools I have used but no longer use:\n\nSudowrite – for fiction rewriting and work with narrative prose.\n\nPoe by Quora – Poe is a service developed by Quora and launched in December 2022. It allows access to a range of AI bots, including my two preferred LLMs: GPT-4o and Claude Opus. This cuts the access cost (ChatGPT+ at $20/m and Claude+ at $20/m) in half (Poe $20/m) and the number of messages allowed per month is more than enough for my use.\n\nChatGPT+ – for Dalle-3 and Vision. (I still use the LLM, just via API or Poe instead.)\n\nThings I wrote about the tools I’m using/was using:\n\n(Please note much of this is older information)\n\nSudowrite Tips and Tricks\n\nMy first days with Sudowrite (June 2021 – October 2021)\n\nArticles\n\n(Please note much of this is older information)\n\nNew Yorker: The Computers Are Getting Better at Writing\n\nThe Verge: The Great Fiction of AI: The strange world of high-speed semi-automated genre fiction – a long-form article that yours truly appears in.\n\nThe Verge: How Kindle novelists are using ChatGPT – an interview with me about the ChatGPT explosion\n\nAI-Generated Content and Copyright Law: What We Know (Posted Apr. 18, 2023 – this landscape is likely to change rapidly, so by the time you read this, some questions in the article may have been answered in a court case or by a regulatory body somewhere.)\n\n4 Ethical Questions Generative AI Poses\n\nThe scary truth about AI copyright is nobody knows what will happen next\n\nVideos\n\n(Please note much of this is older information)\n\nThe Creative Penn (YouTube): The AI-Augmented Author.

      "# [Sudowrite Review: A Writer’s Best Friend? by Lolade on 2024-12-06](https://autogpt.net/sudowrite-review-a-writers-best-friend/)\nImagine having a writing assistant that understands your style, sparks creativity, and even helps refine your drafts. Sounds like a dream, right? That’s exactly what Sudowrite promises. But does it live up to its claims? This comprehensive Sudowrite review dives deep into Sudowrite’s tools, features, pricing, and more. Let’s find out if it’s the right tool for you.\n\nWhat Is Sudowrite?\n\nSudowrite is an advanced AI-powered writing assistant designed to help writers tackle creative and technical challenges. Built with writers in mind, it goes beyond simple grammar corrections by diving into the heart of storytelling, brainstorming, and editing.\n\nSudowrite Review: Tools/Features\n\nSudowrite comes packed with features that cater to both new and experienced writers. Let’s check out these tools in detail and see how they can transform your writing process.\n\n1. Story Engine\n\nPlotting a story is one of the toughest challenges for writers. The Story Engine simplifies this by acting like a brainstorming partner. It breaks down your narrative into manageable parts, helping you develop a clear structure. Whether you’re outlining a novel or working on a screenplay, this feature provides:\n\nSuggestions for Story Arcs: Need help crafting a compelling journey for your characters? The Story Engine suggests arcs that resonate with your genre and style.\n\nPacing Tips: Sudowrite ensures your story flows smoothly by identifying slow or rushed sections.\n\nCharacter Development: From protagonist backstories to sidekick motivations, the Story Engine assists in building characters with depth.\n\nIt’s like having a professional editor guide your storytelling while still giving you full creative control.\n\n2. Rewrite Suggestions\n\nLet’s face it: everyone struggles with awkward sentences now and then. The Rewrite Suggestions tool is a lifesaver in such moments. It scans your text for clarity, grammar, and style issues, then offers alternative phrasing that maintains your voice all without hours of manual editing.\n\nFor example:\n\nClunky Sentence: “She ran quickly across the park, her feet pounding on the wet grass.”\n\nRewrite Suggestion: “She sprinted across the park, her footsteps thudding against the damp grass.”\n\n3. Describe Tool\n\nHave you ever stared at a blank page, unsure how to describe a scene or character? The Describe Tool steps in with vivid imagery and sensory details to make your writing pop.\n\nSay you’re describing a sunset. Instead of defaulting to “The sky turned orange and pink,” Sudowrite might suggest:\n\n“The horizon blazed with streaks of fiery orange, melting into soft hues of blush pink, as if the day was bidding a dramatic farewell.”\n\nThis tool is perfect for writers aiming to create immersive worlds, whether in novels, short stories, or even poetry.\n\n4. Brainstorming Assistance\n\nWriter’s block? Sudowrite’s Brainstorming Assistance ensures you’re never out of ideas. It acts as a springboard for creativity, helping you push past mental roadblocks. You can get creative prompts for:\n\nPlot Twists: What if your protagonist discovers a shocking secret?\n\nDialogue Ideas: How would a quirky sidekick respond in a tense situation?\n\nCharacter Traits: Give your villain an unexpected soft spot.\n\n5. Tone Check\n\nTone consistency can make or break a piece of writing. The Tone Check tool ensures your work matches the intended mood throughout. Think of it as a second set of eyes to keep your writing polished and professional.\n\nHow It Works: Sudowrite scans your text for tone shifts and suggests adjustments. For instance, if a formal essay suddenly becomes too casual, it will flag the section and propose edits.\n\nWhy It Matters: This is especially helpful for writers juggling multiple projects with varying tones, like business reports and creative fiction.\n\n6. Beta Reader AI\n\nEvery writer knows the value of feedback, but getting someone to read your work isn’t always easy. That’s where the Beta Reader AI comes in.\n\nWhat It Does: This tool provides detailed feedback on your draft, pointing out:\n\nWhat’s working (e.g., engaging dialogue or strong pacing).\n\nWhat’s unclear (e.g., plot holes or confusing transitions).\n\nAreas for improvement (e.g., underdeveloped characters or flat descriptions).\n\nHow It Feels: Unlike human beta readers who might take weeks, Sudowrite delivers instant insights. It’s constructive and objective, giving you the tools to elevate your writing without sugarcoating.\n\nFeature Comparison Table\n\nHow to Use Sudowrite\n\nGetting started with Sudowrite is straightforward. Here’s a quick guide:\n\n1. Sign Up and Log In\n\nCreate an account on the Sudowrite website. Once logged in, you’ll be greeted by an intuitive dashboard you can navigate easily.\n\n2. Choose Your Goal\n\nSudowrite would ask you questions on genre, the kind of writing you do and areas you need help with. Select the relevant options to tailor Sudowrite’s suggestions to your needs.\n\n3. Upload or Start Fresh\n\nYou can upload an existing draft or start from scratch. Sudowrite integrates seamlessly with platforms like Google Docs for easy editing.\n\n4. Explore Features\n\nUse the Describe Tool for vivid imagery.\n\nTap the Brainstorm Tool for fresh ideas.\n\nRun Tone Check to align with your audience.\n\n5. Refine Your Work\n\nReview Sudowrite’s suggestions, tweak as necessary, and polish your piece to perfection.\n\n6. Save and Export\n\nOnce satisfied, save your work or export it in a format of your choice.\n\nPro Tip\n\nLeverage the Beta Reader AI before finalizing your draft. It highlights blind spots you might miss.\n\nSudowrite Review: Pricing\n\nNote:\n\nUnused credits rollover for 12 months in the “Max” plan.\n\nThe tool gives a free trial for all its plans.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date pricing information, please visit Sudowrite’s official website.\n\nSudowrite Review: Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nUser-Friendly Interface: Easy to navigate for beginners and pros alike.\n\nVersatile Features: Useful for fiction, non-fiction, and business writing.\n\nCreative Boost: Helps overcome writer’s block effectively.\n\nCustomizable Suggestions: Adapts to your writing style.\n\nCons\n\nCost: Pro Plan may be pricey for occasional users.\n\nLearning Curve: Some tools require practice to master.\n\nLimited Free Version: Advanced features are behind a paywall.\n\nIs Sudowrite Right for You?\n\nWho Should Use Sudowrite?\n\nFiction Writers: Need help with descriptions or story arcs? Sudowrite has your back.\n\nContent Creators: Generate ideas and refine tone with ease.\n\nBusiness Professionals: Write clearer emails and reports.\n\nWho Might Skip It?\n\nCasual Writers: If you write sporadically, the Pro Plan might not be worth it.\n\nBudget-Conscious Users: Free alternatives might suffice for basic needs.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSudowrite is that tool for writers looking to boost their creativity and streamline their workflow. Even though the pricing might deter occasional users, the value it offers for serious writers is undeniable. So, is it worth it? If you’re ready to elevate your writing and overcome creative hurdles, Sudowrite is a tool you’ll want to explore.\n\nAlso read: A ChatPDF Review: Is it Worth the Hype?\n\nSudowrite Review: FAQs\n\n1.

      "# [I tried Sudowrite to overcome writer’s block — and I finally finished my novel by Amanda Caswell on 2024-09-04](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/i-tried-sudowrite-to-overcome-writer-s-block-and-i-finally-finished-my-novel)\nWhen I first heard about Sudowrite, I was intrigued but skeptical. The AI writing platform uses over two dozen AI models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude 2 by Anthropic, multiple open models, and transformer models created by OpenAI.\n\nThe result? Your writing gets a human-like narrative that's impressively good. After diving in, I can confidently say it has exceeded my expectations in many ways.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at how Sudowrite helps bring stories to life.\n\nMy first impressions\n\nUpon opening Sudowrite, I was greeted with a clean and intuitive interface, which meant I didn't have to spend hours figuring out how to use it. After watching a quick video, within minutes, I was ready to explore its three main modes: Describe, Brainstorm, and Rewrite.\n\nStarting a new project in Sudowrite is straightforward. I recommend enabling the Story Bible feature, where you can input all the details about your novel, including your outline, synopsis, and characters.\n\nOne of my favorite features is style. Simply input a sample paragraph, and AI will analyze and match your writing style. I included a paragraph of my own writing and even added that I wanted a structure similar to that of Beverly Cleary. Surprise – Sudowrite delivered!\n\nHow Sudowrite helps you write\n\nThe Describe Mode is where Sudowrite truly shines. I often struggle to paint vivid pictures with my words, but this mode changed the game for me.\n\nBy inputting a few keywords or a simple sentence, Sudowrite generated detailed descriptions that added depth and richness to my writing. It felt like having a personal creative assistant who could effortlessly expand on my ideas.\n\nNext, I tried the Brainstorm Mode. As someone who occasionally hits creative roadblocks, this feature was a lifesaver.\n\nI fed it a basic concept, and Sudowrite presented me with a plethora of directions to take my story, which I then turned into beats for each chapter.\n\nIt was like having a brainstorming session with a highly imaginative friend who never runs out of ideas.\n\nOther features\n\nIn less than a minute, AI weaves together your beats to seamlessly generate a chapter. Be sure to keep the application open. Switching tabs might cause glitches. Once the chapter is created, you can go in and make any necessary edits or move on to the next chapter.\n\nSudowrite offers fun plugins to keep you motivated. Some of my favorites are the Simulated New Yorker Review, Encouraging Writing Buddy, Brainstorm, and Feedback. If you’re a glutton for punishment, you might enjoy the Hyper Critical Writing Buddy and Brutal Honesty Bot (personally, I avoid those at all costs).\n\nFinally, the Rewrite Mode helped me refine my drafts. It suggested alternative phrasings and sentence structures, making my writing flow better and read more smoothly. This mode is perfect for those final touches before hitting ‘publish’ or submitting a manuscript.\n\nPerformance and pricing\n\nNow, let’s talk about the elephant in the room: pricing. Sudowrite’s subscription plans are on the higher side, which might be a dealbreaker for some. However, considering the productivity boost and creative inspiration it provided me, I found it worth the investment.\n\nIf you’re serious about writing and can afford it, Sudowrite is a valuable tool. You can give it a test drive for free, but if you’re serious about your writing, subscriptions start at $10/month. Trust me, it’s worth it.\n\nWhile Sudowrite impressed me overall, it wasn’t without flaws. I’ve had it change a character’s name mid-story and transform another’s curly hair into a spiky hairdo for no reason. The AI generated content was generally coherent and contextually appropriate, but there were moments when the output felt a bit off. These instances required some manual tweaking, reminding me that AI still can’t completely replace the human touch.\n\nOne of the unexpected perks of Sudowrite is its strong community. The developers actively engage with users, regularly updating the platform based on feedback. Customer support is also top-notch, ensuring that any issues or questions are promptly addressed.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nSudowrite has genuinely transformed my approach to writing. Six months ago, if you had told me I’d complete not one, but two YA science fiction novels, I would have laughed.\n\nIf you’d told me one of those novels would hit #1 on Amazon for a week, I’d have begged for the secret.\n\nSudowrite isn’t just a tool; it’s a creative companion that can help unlock your writing potential. Give it a try, and you might just find yourself finally writing that novel.\n\nMore from Tom's Guide",
      "# [5+ Generative AI Writing Tools Everyone Should Know About by Bernard Marr on 2024-03-06](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/03/06/5-generative-ai-writing-tools-everyone-should-know-about/)\nOne of the most popular use cases for generative AI is writing. This is thanks to the ability of tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to create any kind of text, from poetry and fiction to technical documents.\n\nTheir ability to understand context and mimic any human writing style in order to create comprehensive content on any subject is probably their most impressive ability right now.\n\nIt's worth remembering, however, that these large language model (LLM) tools are, for the most part, limited to constructing text based on their training data. This means it isn't necessarily great at communicating new ideas or writing in a way that will grip the attention of a human audience.\n\nBut when it comes to brainstorming, drafting, structuring, researching and fact-checking, it can be a powerful tool that can save time and effort for anyone who needs to create written content.\n\nIt can also speed up all manner of routine, day-to-day writing, such as drafting emails or creating product descriptions for e-commerce businesses.\n\nFive Of My Favorite Generative AI Writing Tools\n\nThe most well-known generative AI tools are all capable of creating written text. But here, I'm focusing on those that specifically provide features and functions designed to assist with writing. These are some of the most useful and interesting players on the field right now:\n\nJasper\n\nJasper was one of the first specialist generative AI writing tools, positioning itself as a solution for marketers needing to create copy in a hurry. It provides templates that speed up the process of generating blogs, social media posts or product listings.\n\nThis gives it an advantage over more general-purpose genAI tools that often start you off on a blank page and require careful prompting if you want them to follow a process to create multiple pieces of writing. It also adapts to its user's style and voice over time.\n\nAnother advantage over general-purpose tools (like ChatGPT) is that Jasper doesn't rely on any one language model. While its output is powered by OpenAI’s models, including GPT-4, it is also reported to use models created by Google, Anthropic and more. Jasper isn’t the cheapest option on the market, but it stands out by providing a tailored set of solutions for marketing-focused writers.\n\nSudowrite\n\nOne thing that sets Sudowrite apart is that it is tailored specifically for fiction writers. So, if you’re looking for an AI that might help you write the next Game Of Thrones, it could be the right choice for you!\n\nSudowrite is built around tools that can help fiction authors, such as brainstorming aids, restructuring sentences to make them more readable or exciting, and providing detailed feedback on their own writing. It is designed to understand concepts such as audiences and genres, as well as what makes a piece of writing engaging for an audience to read. Not sure where your story’s going? Simply hit the Write button and have it continue the tale, giving you options to choose from and mimicking your own tone and voice!\n\nAnyword\n\nAnyword is focused on what it calls \"performance content,\" content designed to sell, generate clicks or encourage audiences to take some other form of action.\n\nIt includes a “predicted performance” stat that attempts to forecast how well your piece of content will go down with your audience. The aim is to automate the data analytics that marketers use when creating and publishing content at the point of writing in order to encourage greater engagement.\n\nUnlike some of the other options here, this is marketed firmly as a business solution and isn't the best choice for hobby writers or those starting a small business marketing strategy from scratch. It’s accessed via an API rather than a friendly chatbot web interface.\n\nBut for established companies who have plenty of data and an established content pipeline that want to start leveraging AI-driven analytics, it’s a good option.\n\nCanva Magic Write\n\nOkay, so this one isn't a standalone writing tool. It’s the writing element of the versatile cloud-based design platform Canva that has recently added a ton of AI functionality under the heading Magic.\n\nAs you might expect, this one is mostly geared toward writing as an element of design rather than creating plain, long-form text. This means it's optimized for creating marketing emails, social media ads and advertising copy. I particularly like the way it lets you adjust the tone of your text. This is stuff that you’d need to dive into prompt engineering in order to do if you’re relying on something like ChatGPT or Gemini to write marketing copy. One of the differences when using a specialized platform is that this kind of use case-specific function is built into the user interface, so it's always at your fingertips.\n\nGrammarly\n\nGrammarly has been around for a long time and has always been marketed as an AI typing assistant. But a major overhaul last year saw the introduction of Grammarly GO, its generative AI-augmented service. Currently still in beta but available to most users, GO uses large language algorithms to provide content suggestions and synonyms and to suggest better ways of saying what you want to say.\n\nIt isn’t a standalone tool that will churn out long-form content on its own, but rather a plugin that can be integrated into software from word processors to web browsers – anywhere you might want to write text. It also scores your text for readability, detects plagiarism and gives automated guidance on word choice and sentence structure. It may not get mentioned in so many news reports as newer players like ChatGPT or Google Gemini, but as an all-around writing assistant for the sort of writing that most people do every day, it's hard to beat.\n\nOther Great Generative AI Writing Tools\n\nThere are many other apps, tools and platforms that also specialize in writing, so here’s a quick overview of the rest!\n\nAI Writer\n\nWrites content like blog posts while citing its sources to help overcome issues of AI hallucination.\n\nChibi\n\nChibi aims to give users deeper control over the AI writing process, creating personalized workflows rather than relying on templates.\n\nContent At Scale\n\nGeared for creating human-like written content for marketing purposes.\n\nCopy.ai\n\nContent creation tool aimed at businesses and enterprises, with built-in templates for common jobs.\n\nCopymatic\n\nAI copywriting tool that specializes in website copy, blogs and social media posts for businesses or hobbyists.\n\nCopysmith\n\nCopysmith’s Describely tool is a very useful application optimized for using AI to write product descriptions for e-commerce.\n\nFraze\n\nThis one provides feedback on grammar and clarity of your writing, and also optimizes copy for SEO purposes.\n\nFriday\n\nA collaborative writing assistant focused on simplifying content production with tools for brainstorming as well as templates.\n\nHemingway\n\nDesigned to help writers create clear, concise and to-the-point writing in an active voice, much like Hemmingway himself.\n\nHyperWrite\n\nWriting assistant with a comprehensive toolbox of AI features to help tackle a variety of writing tasks.\n\nInk\n\nAuto-generate SEO-optimized content to improve ranking in search engines.\n\nLex\n\nAn AI co-pilot for writers offering AI feedback on your work and tools for finding the right words or expressions or generating ideas.\n\nLongshot\n\nCreate more long-form content that differentiates by promising zero hallucinations.\n\nNovelAI\n\nDesigned to help would-be novelists get their ideas out of their heads and onto the page.\n\nOutwrite\n\nAnother extension-based assistant that plugs into your favorite software and offers in-line automated assistance as you work.\n\nProWritingAid\n\nA writing mentor for professionals, offering in-depth analysis of style and readability with the aim of creating elegant prose.\n\nQuillbot\n\nQuillbot bills itself as a paraphraser tool to help writers find a better way of phrasing something.\n\nRytr\n\nGenerates blogs, emails, social media posts, SEO headlines and ads.\n\nScribe\n\nAutomates the creation of documentation, step-by-step and how-to guides.\n\nSEO.AI\n\nThis one focuses on streamlining and automating SEO-related tasks, cutting down the need for manual keyword research.\n\nTextmetrics\n\nProvides feedback on grammar, style and clarity in order to improve the user’s writing.\n\nTextio\n\nTextio is an AI writing assistant specifically designed for HR writing, automating the process of creating performance feedback and assessments.\n\nWordtune\n\nGenerative writing assistant aimed at professionals.\n\nWriter\n\nThis one uses an open-source LLM that has only been trained on freely distributable writing data in order to avoid copyright infringement issues.\n\nWriteSonic\n\nGeared towards creating SEO content and traffic-boosting copy.",
      "# [Sudowrite Review (2025): As Good As A Human? by Jamie Giggs on 2024-03-15](https://bloggingwizard.com/sudowrite-review/)\nWelcome to our Sudowrite review.\n\nSudowrite is an AI writing tool that helps writers finish their manuscripts.\n\nThe platform features a story engine, rewrite functionality, and is able to provide feedback as you progress.\n\nThe key question: is it worth your time?\n\nBy the end of this review, you’ll know the answer, including whether it suits your specific needs.\n\nWe’ll dive into Sudowrite’s capabilities, explore the plans available, and detail what we think are the software’s main pros and cons.\n\nWhat is Sudowrite?\n\nSudowrite is an AI writing tool founded in 2020 by science fiction writers Amit Gupta and James Yu.\n\nAs writers themselves, Amit and James knew all too well the pain that writers experience when rewriting their beloved manuscripts for the 1000th time (trust me, I’ve been there!).\n\nThe pair wanted to create software that broke through writer’s block and invented narrative twists for the user, so writers spent less time dreading the process (and contemplating reality itself) and more time actually writing.\n\nThe result of their efforts? A tool that, at its best, can effectively deliver cogent paragraphs of text that can inspire you to keep writing. One that’s used by over 12,000 novelists, screenwriters, and storytellers.\n\nThat said, is it enough to become your AI writing tool of choice, or should you continue to push on without the help of a machine?\n\nContinue reading for our full review of Sudowrite. I’ll discuss the pros and cons and a few alternatives, too.\n\nWhat features does Sudowrite offer?\n\nSudowrite is a popular AI writing tool. The key features worth knowing about include:\n\nAI writer\n\nRewriter\n\nDescribe\n\nBrainstorm\n\nPoem generator\n\nCustomer support\n\nIntegrations\n\nWe’ll explore these features and give you a first-hand look at the tool.\n\nPlease note: Some of Sudowrite’s features are only available in specific pricing plans.\n\nGetting started\n\nOnce you’ve logged into Sudowrite, you’ll be taken to a screen that looks like this:\n\nIt’s here where you’ll be able to use the central features of the AI writing tool.\n\nIt’s worth noting that there’s also a “tour” feature that takes you through the basics (if need be).\n\nAI writer\n\nTo start using the AI writer, you’ll first need to give it something to work with. This isn’t a couple of words either; the tool requires at least 20 words or more before the cursor.\n\nThere are two ways you can do this: putting in the required 20 words and clicking Write, or turning on the Story Bible (formerly Sudowrite’s story engine) like so:\n\nEssentially, using the Story Bible makes the tool more accurate because you fill in the key details yourself. Those key details include the synopsis of your novel, the style you want it to be written in, details of the main characters, the genre, and, if you can provide it, a general outline of your story by chapter.\n\nThere’s also a section called Braindump. This is where you can put in any extra details and in any form you want, whether that’s a stream-of-consciousness word salad or just a few sentences.\n\nBefore we take a look at the results of the Story Bible mode, let’s see what the regular mode can produce.\n\nI asked the tool to start writing a novel based on a jaded teacher who explores the origins of a portal. Here’s a snippet of what it came up with:\n\n“As Angus trudged along the rugged path in the Scottish Highlands, his mind was clouded with a sense of melancholy. The weight of his monotonous existence as a jaded teacher seemed to grow heavier with each passing day. He had lost the spark that once ignited his passion for education, leaving him with an empty heart and a hollow soul.”\n\nIt’s not bad. Sudowrite has focused on the key elements of the story, including the jaded teacher, and chosen a good setting for him to explore. There’s quite a bit of telling here, though, rather than showing, so it would definitely need editing. That said, it may well be a good starting point if I needed an idea I could run with.\n\nWe can choose to Insert this text into the main editor, and from there, we can edit it as required. That said, it’s more of a summary piece of text than an actual chapter of a novel, which takes us back to the Story Bible mode.\n\nIf we fill out the details like character, setting, and provide a synopsis for our novel, we can get Sudowrite to create the first draft of a chapter. I input the details, and this was the result of the opening of Chapter 1:\n\n“In the bustling city of New York, Angus, a young journalist, begins to notice strange occurrences in the local government. He starts to collect information for a story, but the closer he gets to the truth, the more he is warned to stay away.”\n\nIt sounds pretty engaging, although it’s worth mentioning that the tool struggled to fill out the rest of the chapter and has changed our main character, Angus, to a young journalist living in New York. What’s here is good, but the details aren’t exactly what I asked for.\n\nThat being said, the tool can go further. I asked it to expand the text, and it came up with the next 15 chapters.\n\nFor example, in Chapter 5, Angus meets a man named Jeff, who trains him in self-defense, hacking, and espionage techniques. Angus also learns about the history of mind-control technology and how it’s been secretly developed over decades.\n\nThe rest of the outline is relatively decent and would certainly help an author during the preliminary stages of planning their novel. As a way of generating ideas, it’s solid.\n\nI asked the tool again to expand the first chapter, and here’s one of the opening paragraphs:\n\n“A woman’s voice chimed in, her tone icy and detached, ‘we discovered that our suspicions were correct—the government has been conducting experiments on innocent civilians.’ She paused for effect, her breath frosting as it met the frigid air. ‘Not just any experiments, though. They’re trying to create…monsters.’\n\n“‘Monsters?’ Angus echoed, his voice barely above a whisper. His mind raced with horrifying images, each one more grotesque than the last. Unwillingly, he recalled the eerie stories his grandmother used to tell him as a child, stories he had long dismissed as mere folklore.”\n\nAs an opener, this definitely lures the reader in. However, the story is a little basic and seems to involve the government creating “monsters.” As it goes on, some of the text lacks the depth I’d expect from a published novel, and it does come across as somewhat amateur.\n\nThat said, we can choose to add this text to the editor and refine it from there:\n\nOverall, the AI writer, albeit far from perfect, is a great way to bounce story ideas around.\n\nRewriter\n\nSudowrite’s Rewriter feature is a useful addition to the suite. Clicking the Rewrite button allows us to change bits of text we’re not happy with and even alter the writing style:\n\nFor the first paragraph of Chapter 1, I asked the tool to rewrite it in a more descriptive style. Here’s a snippet of the result:\n\n“The narrow alleyway loomed before Angus, its walls closing in on him as he approached the designated meeting spot. The air felt thick and heavy, like a looming sense of danger that threatened to suffocate him.\n\nHis heart thudded heavily against his ribcage, matching the rhythm of his quickened steps. Beads of sweat gathered at his temples, despite the biting cold that seeped into his bones. He questioned his sanity for getting involved with this dangerous conspiracy, but there was no turning back now.”\n\nWe can see that, in no time at all, more adjectives have been added to the text. The text, as a whole, now feels more engaging and works better as a pacey opener to what I would imagine would be a cross between mystery and thriller.\n\nWe can choose to rephrase the text if we’re unsure about the result simply by clicking Rephrase. Here’s that same paragraph reworked:\n\n“Angus felt the walls of the dim alleyway closing in on him as he made his way towards the predetermined meeting spot. His heart pounded against his chest and sweat formed on his forehead, despite the frigid air. He couldn’t help but question his own judgment for getting involved in this dangerous scheme, but it was too late to turn back now.”\n\nAs you can see, a selection of words have been changed, with others moved around. Sudowrite provides you with variants of the rewrite. For instance, if I scroll down the page, I can see a more descriptive version of the rewrite, one that’s another rephrase, and an additional descriptive version, giving me plenty of choice.\n\nI can also use the rewrite functionality to add more in the way of showing rather than telling to the piece. All good writers know the importance of getting these two right, and it’s great to see an option to cut down on some of that intrusive telling. Here’s the result:\n\n“The narrow alley was shrouded in darkness as Angus cautiously made his way towards the designated meeting spot. The cold air stung his cheeks and he could feel his heart pounding against his chest.\n\nHis palms were slick with sweat, a mixture of nerves and fear. As he approached the figure standing in the shadows, he couldn’t help but question his judgement for getting involved in this dangerous scheme. But it was too late to turn back.”\n\nThe cold air stinging his cheeks creates a strong image in our mind, and it’s a more powerful way of showing the reader that it’s cold. That said, I’m not sure we need to even say it’s cold. We could show that further, although that’s a story for another time.\n\nAll in all, the rewrite functionality impressed me, and while I wouldn’t rely on it solely, it could serve as a way to get me writing again.\n\nDescribe\n\nLeaving Angus and the government monster scheme behind, another notable feature of Sudowrite is the Describe feature. We can activate it like so:\n\nWe simply highlight a word or phrase we want to describe, and Sudowrite will give us suggestions based on all five senses–this includes the use of metaphors.\n\nKeeping to the theme, I highlighted the word “Monster,” and this was what the tool produced for sight:\n\n“The monster’s body was a tangle of twisted limbs, each one ending in sharp claws that glinted in the dim light. Its skin was a sickly pale color, almost translucent, and covered in pulsating veins.”\n\nHere’s what it generated for smell:\n\n“The stench of decay surrounds the monster, a mixture of rotting flesh and damp earth. Its breath reeks of death and its presence fills the air with a nauseating odor.”\n\nQuite vivid. Here’s another for taste:\n\n“The thought of tasting the monster’s flesh made one’s stomach churn. It was said that those who had tried had described it as a foul combination of dirt, mold, and something unidentifiable yet repulsive.”\n\nIn terms of metaphors, Sudowrite generated this:\n\n“The monster was born of shadows and whispers, a creature of the night with eyes that glowed like embers and a roar that could shatter even the bravest of hearts. Its terrifying form was both primordial and otherworldly, a reminder of the dark secrets that lurk within us all.”\n\nThe senses are better than the metaphor. Still, it’s a helpful addition to get the neurons firing.\n\nBrainstorm\n\nWhat about those times when you just need writing ideas in general, whether it’s character names, settings, or even plot points? Well, Sudowrite does have a feature that can help.\n\nIt’s located here:\n\nOnce we’ve clicked that, we’re taken to an attractive-looking grid:\n\nIt’s here where we can pick the specific part of writing we need help with. As a fan of great world-building myself, I chose to see what Sudowrite could do in that department. Here’s the result:\n\n“A mysterious black stone found only in the depths of the ocean, it glows with a faint blue light and has been known to give its owner the power to control minds.”\n\nIt’s a strange derivative, considering I asked the tool to describe a fantasy world. I tried again, and here was the second result:\n\n“The Phantom’s Touch: An illegal substance created from the ashes of a being from a different dimension, it gives the user the ability to phase through objects and render themselves invisible for a short period of time.”\n\nWhile I like the description here, I asked the tool to do something else. I played some more with it and found that Sudowrite prefers to describe items within the fictional world rather than the world itself.\n\nNot the best result here.\n\nI tried asking the tool to create some names for an island nation inhabited by warriors. The results:\n\nThundercliff\n\nSavage Coast\n\nValoria\n\nShieldhaven\n\nShield Isle\n\nA better result overall, although it’s clear Sudowrite does have its limitations.\n\nPoem generator\n\nPoem lovers will be pleased to know that Sudowrite can create poems. I asked it to create a poem on danger, and here’s the first paragraph of what it came up with:\n\nBullets for Breakfast\n\nIn the land of the free, we sip coffee and load our guns\n\nWe cook our eggs and fry our bacon,\n\nButter our toast and oil our guns\n\nWe kiss our loved ones goodbye and holster our guns\n\nIt’s a decent result, if a tad nonsensical.\n\nI asked it to create a second poem on writing itself:\n\nThe Muse’s Gift\n\nIt comes in waves, this gift of words\n\nSometimes a trickle, sometimes a flood\n\nA turn of phrase, a thought profound\n\nWords from my muse, my pen unbound\n\nA better result.\n\nHow much mileage you’ll get out of the poem generator will depend on your needs, but it’s a respectable extra.\n\nCustomer support\n\nSudowrite does feature customer support, albeit one that isn’t that extensive.\n\nBy clicking the question mark symbol on the dashboard, you’ll be able to reach the team via email, live chat, or you can, instead, consult the FAQ guide:\n\nThe FAQs are simple but get the job done with some (fairly) thorough answers.\n\nThe live chat loaded up quickly, although I did have to wait some time before a member of the team could answer my query. Clicking the Support button at the bottom of the page will also bring up the live chat.\n\nFinally, there’s the ability to suggest new features to the team–something I thought was welcome.\n\nIntegrations\n\nSudowrite’s integrations are currently limited. The tool integrates with Google Docs, Invoice2go, and Airtable.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nSudowrite comes in three main tiers: Hobby & Student, Professional, and Max. Naturally, each plan includes differing features, benefits, and usage limits.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each of them.\n\nSudowrite’s Hobby & Student plan starts at $10 per month on the yearly plan or $19 on the monthly plan. It includes 225,000 credits per month.\n\nA credit is based on the AI model and how many words it reads and writes for you. This plan comes with a free trial, and no credit card is required. It’s aimed at people who write for fun or for school and need help with the writing process. There’s enough here for a story idea or two, and the twist feature is available.\n\nSudowrite’s Professional plan starts at $22 per month on the yearly plan or $29 on the monthly plan. It currently includes 1,000,000 credits per month (although this is subject to change). This plan comes with a free trial, and no credit card is required. It’s intended for those who want to write a novel or screenplay using AI tools. Note the Story Engine feature for writing stories is now known as the Story Bible.\n\nSudowrite’s Max plan starts at $44 per month on the yearly plan or $59 on the monthly plan. It includes 2,000,000 credits per month. It’s aimed at prolific authors who publish multiple novels and screenplays a year and need to keep their creative juices flowing.\n\nPros and cons\n\nSudowrite is a well-designed AI writing assistant for story writing, but it also has its weaknesses. Here’s a brief round-up of what we thought were the biggest pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\nAI writer. It’s not perfect, but the AI tool can successfully create text for your novel, whether that’s a chapter summary or the entire chapter itself. This can be achieved in a few minutes if you have the necessary credits.\n\nRewriter functionality. The option to rewrite paragraphs and include more showing (and less telling) is here. You can also add in extra description or make sentences more intense. This is perhaps the most useful part for full-time writers.\n\nWriting senses generator. Sudowrite can generate descriptions for each of the five senses based on a single word or phrase. You can also get it to produce metaphors of varying quality. It’s a helpful feature.\n\nCons\n\nAffordability. The tool could be cheaper, and the credits won’t last long if you’re attempting a full novel of 70,000+ words.\n\nLack of integrations. There are very few integrations at the time of writing, although we do expect this to change over time.\n\nCustomer support. What’s here is serviceable, but it’s not outstanding. There isn’t much in the way of additional support should you need it.\n\nAlternatives\n\nNeed to look at some alternatives? Check out our recommended AI writing tools before we head to our Sudowrite review conclusion:\n\nRytr | Our review — A fantastic all-round AI writer with additional generative AI capabilities. With an AI image generator that punches above its weight, exclusive writing profiles for copywriters, and over 40 different use cases, including emails, poems, and video descriptions, the value for money speaks for itself.\n\nFrase | Our review — One of the best AI content creation and writing tools available with a lot of hidden functionality within its features.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThat concludes our Sudowrite review.\n\nOverall, Sudowrite allows you to quickly generate text for your novel or screenplay in a few clicks.\n\nWhile it may not be able to produce chapters without edits or come up with the most original prose, most aspiring writers will absolutely find its ability to bounce ideas around useful.\n\nThe rewrite functionality, in particular, is easy to use and, in the right scenario, will break through even the most stubborn writer’s block.\n\nWe recommend you give any of the free plans a try to see if it’s the best AI writing tool for you.",

It has a dedicated “Poem” tool that generates a contemporary free verse poem in seconds!\n\nGetting Started with Sudowrite\n\nI started by going to the Sudowrite homepage, scrolling down, and selecting “Try Sudowrite for Free” in the bottom right corner.\n\nSudowrite is free forever (no credit card required) with a generous starting balance of 50,000 credits. Once those credits are consumed, plans start at $10 per month, making Sudowrite affordable for writers of all levels.\n\nOnce I signed up, Sudowrite gave me a quick demo of how to write and describe using AI. I found the demo helpful, giving me more confidence in using Sudowrite as my AI writer.\n\nAfter the demo, I was taken to an untitled Sudowrite project where I could start writing. The user interface was clean and intuitive, making navigating the various features and tools Sudowrite offers easy.\n\nLet's get into a brief explanation of the Sudowrite tools and how to use them.\n\nSudowrite Tools\n\nSudowrite offers a range of tools that writers can use to enhance their writing process, which can be divided into three categories:\n\nBrainstorming Tools\n\nWriting Tools\n\nEditing Tools\n\nWe'll explore the main tools that come with Sudowrite, and I will show you how I used these tools to begin writing a novel!\n\n1. Brainstorming Tools\n\nWhether you're writing fiction, blog posts, or any other creative content, these brainstorming tools provide practical help, enabling you to generate unique and captivating storylines:\n\nBrainstorm: “Brainstorm” is a giant list builder that generates the perfect name or title. It's like having a reliable and endless source of ideas. Give a thumbs up to your favorite ideas, which will provide you with even better ones.\n\nCanvas: “Canvas” allows you to create an outline containing a summary of your story, character secrets, and plot twists. It's a convenient space to store all your inspiration and references in one location.\n\nVisualize: “Visualize” enhances your character sheets and world-building documents by turning your descriptions into captivating artwork.\n\nHow I Used Sudowrite's Brainstorm Tools\n\nHere's how I used Sudowrite's brainstorming tools to get ideas for a story to write using Sudowrite.\n\nBrainstorm\n\nIn my Sudowrite project, I selected “Brainstorm” at the top.\n\nI was asked what I wanted to brainstorm, ranging from dialogues, names, characters, places, and more! I selected “Something Else” to generate my novel title.\n\nFor Sudowrite to give me a list of potential titles for my novel, I had to tell it what to provide me with (in my case, “Novel titles.”)\n\nOptionally, I could give Sudowrite some context and title examples. I didn't have any examples, so I left that blank. However, I did have some context of the novel I was planning on writing, so I placed that in the “Context” field.\n\nFrom there, I hit “Start” to see what novel title ideas Sudowrite would generate.\n\nInstantly, Sudowrite gave me a list of engaging novel titles! All of the ideas were good, but there was one that I particularly liked: “Three Minutes Ahead: A Detective LaBlanche Mystery.”\n\nI gave it a thumbs up to add it to my “Keepers” list, and that title was immediately replaced with another excellent title. If I didn't like the title, I could give it a thumbs down to be instantly replaced with a new title.\n\nWhether I selected the thumbs up or down, each idea was replaced with a new one. The Sudowrite brainstorm feature is a never-ending source of creative inspiration!\n\nAfter saving my list and exiting, I returned to my Sudowrite project. Sudowrite AI added my Brainstorm list to the History panel on the right, where I could easily insert, copy, open, or favorite it anytime!\n\nSudowrite's brainstorming tool is invaluable for any writer looking to generate fresh ideas like dialogues, names, characters, places, or plot points. With a few clicks, you can unlock a wealth of creativity to fuel your storytelling!\n\nCanvas\n\nWithin my Sudowrite project, I selected “Canvas” on the bottom left.\n\nI was greeted with a large canvas with character cards, images, and an outline! Sudowrite did an excellent job clearly explaining how to use the canvas, which can initially feel overwhelming.\n\nI could start from scratch with blank cards, labels, and outlines by adding them to the bottom of the canvas. Alternatively, I could build characters and a storyline with what was already filled out. I went with the latter.\n\nI started by hovering my mouse over the character cards and selecting the “+” icon to get Sudowrite to generate more character descriptions for me.\n\nSudowrite did an excellent job! This is a great way to add more depth to my characters.\n\nVisualize\n\nI could also select “Visualize” to get Sudowrite to generate an image of the character in seconds based on the description.\n\nThe image looks excellent and fits the description perfectly! This feature brought my characters to life and helped me visualize them in my story.\n\nOn the right was the entire outline for my story. I selected “Generate full outline,” and the whole thing was populated a few seconds later. It was like having a personal writing assistant right at my fingertips.\n\nNext, I selected one of the cards in my outline and clicked “Generate options for this card” to see variations of this part of the story.\n\nSudowrite always generates three variations at a time. Here's one of them:\n\nSudowrite did a fantastic job developing options for this card. The text appears as though it was written by a person, offering me a new viewpoint on how the scene could unfold and enhancing the depth of my overall storyline.\n\nThe Sudowrite canvas is a powerful tool for writers, especially those who may feel overwhelmed by starting from scratch. From generating character descriptions and visuals to creating an entire outline in seconds, Sudowrite is the perfect tool to enhance your storytelling.\n\n2. Writing Tools\n\nUse these writing tools to overcome writer’s block, refine your writing style, and write engaging content:\n\nWrite: “Write” analyzes the traits of your characters, the tone of your writing, and the progression of your plot. From there, it generates 300 words in your unique tone of voice. It also gives you different variations to choose from!\n\nDescribe: Sudowrite's “Describe” tool lets you highlight and describe specific things in your story to facilitate a strong connection between your readers and your characters. This helps your readers feel fully immersed in the story.\n\nExpand: “Expand” enhances the pacing of your story so it isn't too fast, maintaining an ideal pace that prevents readers from being disconnected.\n\nStory Bible (Story Engine): The “Story Bible” feature guides you through each stage of the fiction writing process, from your initial idea to creating an outline, developing chapters, and ultimately generating thousands of words in your unique writing style. You can write an entire novel within a week!\n\nHow I Used Sudowrite to Start Writing a Novel\n\nHere's how I used Sudowrite to begin writing my novel.\n\nWrite\n\nTo begin writing my novel with Sudowrite, I had to write at least 20 words (Sudowrite needs some context to work its magic). After doing so, I placed my cursor at the end of it and clicked on the “Write” button, and Sudowrite sprung into action.\n\nIt's important to note that the dropdown arrow next to the “Write” button offers different writing modes: Auto, Guided (give Sudowrite instructions), and Tone Shift (change your writing style). I could also access my writing settings. In my case, I stuck with the default Auto write but feel free to experiment!\n\nInstantly, Sudowrite continued the story by populating the right panel with some options to continue the story. I skimmed through them and inserted the one I liked most by selecting the “Insert” button. Once inserted, the text turned purple, indicating that Sudowrite had written it and needed editing.\n\nI was thoroughly impressed with what Sudowrite had come up with. The options Sudowrite gave me were well-crafted and perfectly aligned with the tone and style I had in mind for my novel.\n\nThe text also hooks the reader instantly, intriguing them to delve deeper into the story. Sudowrite's ability to capture the essence of my characters and maintain the progression of the plot was remarkable!\n\nDescribe\n\nAfter making a few tweaks (Sudowrite had gotten the pronouns of my detective protagonist wrong), I wanted to explore the “Describe” feature. In my case, the silhouette is something of interest to the reader. I highlighted this word within the document and hit “Describe.”\n\nSudowrite generated descriptions of the Silhouette in the right panel using different senses and metaphors. The options were vivid and imaginative, painting a detailed picture of the silhouette! In my case, the description based on “Sight” made the most sense, so that's the one I inserted into the document.\n\nExpand\n\nAnother tool I loved in Sudowrite is the “Expand” tool, where I could highlight one or multiple sentences and continue the story at an ideal pace. I highlighted the two sentences I had just inserted describing the silhouette and selected “Expand.”\n\nHere is how Sudowrite continued my story after expanding it:\n\nI'm genuinely impressed with the quality of writing. Sudowrite did an excellent job continuing my story and establishing a high level of engagement with optimal pacing!\n\nStory Bible\n\nLast but not least is the Story Bible. This is perfect for people who don't want to start with a blank document, as it will write a first draft of every chapter for you! Crazy, right?\n\nI accessed Story Bible by turning on the “Story Bible” toggle in the bottom left of my document.\n\nFrom there, I began filling out the fields:\n\nBraindump: Write anything and everything you know about your story.\n\nGenre: Identify the genres you are writing in.\n\nStyle: Describe how the story will be written (I highly recommend using “Match my style…” to paste up to 2,000 words of your writing and have Sudowrite describe it).\n\nSynopsis: Present the characters, their goals, and the primary source of conflict while effectively capturing the tone, themes, and distinctive aspects of the story (select “Generate Synopsis” to get Sudowrite to fill this out for you).\n\nCharacters: Describe everything there is to know about the characters, including physical appearance, mannerisms, relationships, and goals (I highly recommend selecting “Generate Characters” to get Sudowrite to generate this for you).\n\nOutline: Write your outline or choose from one of five outlines provided by Sudowrite.\n\nI was thoroughly impressed with how accurately Sudowrite matched my style, generated a synopsis, and more. It made the entire process of writing my story so much easier and enjoyable.\n\nOnce complete, Sudowrite began adding chapters to my document that I could start generating by following the steps. I selected “Generate Beats” (“beats” being the main elements of the chapter), and Sudowrite did an excellent job of giving an overview of the chapter.\n\nThe second step was generating the chapter. I liked that I could choose the speed, accuracy, and more by selecting the down arrow next to the “Generate Chapter” button. This helped me tailor the output to my preferences by giving me the choice of prioritizing speed, accuracy, etc.\n\nSudowrite began writing out the story beats; I could walk away and let Sudowrite write my entire novel. It took a couple of minutes to generate (mind you, this is a whole book chapter!), but the quality of writing was worth the wait. From there, I moved on to the next chapter.\n\nEach beat was concise yet captivating, providing a clear roadmap for the chapter's progression. Sudowrite effortlessly captured the tone and themes of my story, infusing it with the same style and voice that I had established.\n\nSudowrite's Story Bible feature is an absolute game-changer for authors with writer's block who want to pump out an entire novel in a week. Within minutes, I could generate whole chapters of a book; all I had to do was edit it. It truly works like magic!\n\nMake sure you take advantage of the Story Bible resources:\n\nStory Bible Guide\n\nSudowrite Classes\n\n3. Editing Tools\n\nSudowrite’s revision tools offer practical help in revision, better word choice, and story enhancement:\n\nRewrite: Get “Rewrite” to revise your writing without doing it 100 times manually. It's incredibly adaptable, unfailingly persistent, and always open to feedback.\n\nThesaurus: Sudowrite includes an integrated “Thesaurus” where you can highlight a word and instantly generate alternative words with similar meanings.\n\nHow I Used Sudowrite to Edit a Novel\n\nHere's how I used Sudowrite to edit my novel.\n\nRewrite\n\nIf I needed to make some revisions, Sudowrite's Rewrite tool was invaluable. It allowed me to revise my writing quickly without countless manual edits. To use it, I only highlighted the sentence or sentences I wanted to rewrite and hit the “Rewrite” button.\n\nIn the right panel, I could choose how I wanted Sudowrite to rewrite my sentences, whether rephrasing them or making them shorter, more descriptive, adding inner conflict, and more. I could even give it a custom request with the “Customize” option! I went with “Rephrase” and hit “Go.”\n\nSudowrite generated two variations of the original sentence. The sentence was excellently rewritten, maintaining the meaning and providing a new perspective with more description.\n\nThesaurus\n\nSudowrite's “Thesaurus” tool (it doesn't seem to have a name; I'm just calling it that) gave me different synonyms to replace words that I felt would be better. I highlighted “billowed” in my document, and Sudowrite suggested a few synonyms.\n\nSelecting the “more…” option took me to a “word cloud” page where I could select the word I wanted to use. I chose “fluttered” and could generate more like that word or copy it to insert it into my text.\n\nAnd there you have it! My entire process of writing a novel using Sudowrite's primary brainstorming, writing, and editing tools.\n\nI was amazed by the caliber of writing Sudowrite generates and how efficient the process was, particularly with the help of Story Bible. I'm convinced anyone at any skill level can produce an entire novel within a week!\n\nWhat I Liked About Sudowrite\n\nUp to 50,000 credits on the permanently free version of Sudowrite, suitable for writers on any budget.\n\nThe interface is easy to navigate, and the tools are fun.\n\nSudowrite generates excellent results that sound human, making it a valuable tool for beginner writers.\n\nSave significant time using AI to streamline your creative process (Story Bible can write an entire novel within a week!)\n\nTools for each stage of the creative writing process, from brainstorming to writing to editing.\n\nUse AI to turn descriptions into artwork instantly for better visualization.\n\nThe content is written accurately in your unique tone of voice.\n\nKeep readers engaged by using AI to describe things in your story more deeply and expand text for optimal pacing.\n\nGet Sudowrite to rewrite up to six variations simultaneously rather than doing this manually.\n\nHighlight individual words and select better synonyms Sudowrite suggests.\n\nChapters are organized neatly within projects.\n\nWrites in almost any language; does not plagiarize.\n\nSudowrite Google Chrome Extension for those who want to use Sudowrite in Google Docs.\n\nSudowrite Discord community if you have questions or want to connect with like-minded AI writers.\n\nSudowrite Manual on how to use Sudowrite.\n\nWhat I Disliked About Sudowrite\n\nSudowrite may get aspects of the story wrong, such as pronouns or characters.\n\nA lot of features may feel overwhelming for some users.\n\nThe canvas feature was useful but felt clunky.\n\nTop 3 Sudowrite Alternatives I've Tried\n\nIn this section, I will compare Sudowrite to other AI story generators I've used to help you decide which tool best suits your writing needs.\n\nJasper AI\n\nJasper AI is among the best AI writing assistants on the market. Give it a text prompt, and it will generate creative and engaging content in your unique tone of voice. You can write an entire story or a 1,500-word article in seconds!\n\nOne of the most significant differences between the platforms is the target demographics. Jasper AI is designed more for marketing teams and businesses to maintain a consistent brand voice while collaborating on generating compelling content across multiple channels. There's a feature for creating brand voices and campaigns, which Sudowrite does not have.\n\nMeanwhile, Sudowrite is more geared towards creative writers who want to rekindle their passion for writing and overcome writer's block. Tools like the Canvas for describing characters and creating outlines and the Story Bible that generates an entire novel chapter by chapter make it clear that Sudowrite focuses on providing a creative writing experience.\n\nWhile both tools benefit marketers and creative writers, choose Jasper for more robust marketing and business tools for your team to collaborate. If you are a creative writer, like an author or poet, choose Sudowrite.\n\nWe also Compare Jasper Vs. Copy AI & Jasper Vs. Scalenut.\n\nRead our Jasper Review or visit Jasper.\n\nWritesonic\n\nWritesonic is another powerful writing tool that uses AI technology to create high-quality content. With Writesonic, you can generate blog posts, social media captions, and generate entire stories with just a few clicks.\n\nWhat sets Writesonic apart from Sudowrite is its ability to cater to a wide range of writing needs. Whether you're a content marketer looking for catchy headlines or a startup founder needing persuasive copy for your landing page, Writesonic has what you need.\n\nThe platform offers various templates and prompts to get your creative juices flowing. You can give specific details about your topic or let Writesonic develop creative ideas for you. It is incredibly user-friendly and intuitive, making it accessible to writers of all skill levels.\n\nOne notable feature of Writesonic is its ability to generate entire stories. Whether you're in need of a short fiction piece or a longer narrative, Writesonic can provide you with a well-crafted story that captures the essence of your chosen genre.\n\nAlthough Writesonic can write stories from start to finish, it also offers tools and templates for other types of writers. Choose Writesonic if you plan on using it as a writing tool for a variety of purposes that go beyond story writing. For fictional writers who want more robust brainstorming, writing, and editing tools for their novels, choose Sudowrite!\n\nRead our Writesonic Review or visit Writesonic.\n\nPlot Factory\n\nPlot Factory is another AI-powered writing platform that allows you to collaboratively plan, organize, and write stories. Unlike Sudowrite and Jasper AI, Plot Factory focuses specifically on helping writers develop and organize their story plots. However, it still generates stories with AI.\n\nWith Plot Factory, you can create different “universes” that house stories, characters, places, objects, and more. It provides a comprehensive toolkit for structuring your story, planning scenes, and tracking the progression of your characters.\n\nWhile Sudowrite and Jasper AI provide more versatile writing assistance across various genres and styles, Plot Factory excels in organizing and planning out stories. If you're a writer who struggles with plot development or want to improve your storytelling structure and character development, Plot Factory is the perfect tool for you!\n\nSudowrite Review: Can AI Write Novels That Sound Human?\n\nAfter using Sudowrite's tools to write a novel from start to finish, Sudowrite is more than capable of writing compelling content that sounds human. Although it can't replace actual writing, I would argue that it's still better than what humans can write.\n\nFrom the start, Sudowrite matched my tone of voice and pacing while infusing words I would have never thought of to captivate readers. The AI-powered platform effortlessly weaved together intricate plotlines, compelling characters, and immersive settings. It was like having a co-author who understood and brought my creative vision to life.\n\nBesides the brainstorming tools that helped me develop unique titles, characters, and plotlines, Sudowrite wrote my entire novel without me lifting a finger. All I had to do was indicate what the story was about and the genre. I walked away from my computer, knowing Sudowrite would continue crafting my story with the same creativity and attention to detail. After that, I used Sudowrite's AI editing tools to make the final touches.\n\nI hope you found my review of Sudowrite helpful! Whether you're a beginner writer or a seasoned author, I'm confident Sudowrite will revolutionize your writing process. With its AI-powered tools and seamless integration into your creative vision, Sudowrite offers an experience like no other.

      "# [Sudowrite Review: My Favorite AI Creative Writing Tool! [2024] by Neil Chase, www.facebook.com on 2023-02-12](https://neilchasefilm.com/sudowrite-review/)\nSometimes, writing fiction can seem like a labor of love. Not only is it lonely hard work, but there’s no way to tell if your readers will appreciate your efforts.\n\nAll the while, you face (and sometimes lose) countless battles with writer’s block and the feelings of inadequacy that come with it.\n\nIf only you had a writing partner to share the burden, perhaps it would be easier!\n\nLucky for you, there are several AI story-writing assistants that can accompany you on your creative journey!\n\nOne of them is Sudowrite, and in this Sudowrite review, we reveal its features, pros, cons, alternatives, and our verdict on whether it’s worth the investment.\n\nWhat is Sudowrite?\n\nSudowrite is an AI novel writing assistant that makes the creative writing process more fun and interactive. It has many fantastic features, such as helping brainstorm ideas for characters and plot points, rewriting sections of your story in a different tone, and giving great vocabulary suggestions!\n\nThe AI program also acts as a beta reader for your stories, giving you constructive feedback and new ideas to try.\n\nUnlike other AI writing tools, it’s more helpful in writing fiction, though you can also use it to write non-fiction.\n\nAccording to one of its founders, you can think of this AI creative writing tool as a “sparring partner who helps you edit your book, create new scenes, and generate plot ideas.”\n\nWhen you get stuck on a sentence or can’t find the words to describe a story element, you can rely on Sudowrite to move your story forward.\n\nAs with other AI tools and technologies like chatbots, Speech-to-Text, and assistants like Siri, Sudowrite relies on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to produce its output.\n\nThe implication of using NLP and machine learning is that this AI tool can develop a level of understanding of your story. So, it offers suggestions you can use in your own writing based on what it understands, as though it were your co-writer.\n\nYou can use Sudowrite as a brainstorming tool when writing novels, to produce a rough first draft, to develop story elements and character arcs, for world-building, and so on.\n\nIt can even help you with creative writing that isn’t your strong point (particularly poetry) and offer an opinion on your writing like it was a friend you gave your story to read.\n\nTop Benefits of Sudowrite\n\nHow can Sudowrite help you? Below, we list some of the main benefits of using this AI story generator software to write stories.\n\nOvercome Writer’s Block: When you get stuck on ideas, you can turn to Sudowrite for ideas on how to progress your story.\n\nCompliment Your Writing Style: Sudowrite develops an understanding of your story as it progresses and will proffer suggestions that fit right in with your own work.\n\nGet AI-Provided Feedback: One of Sudowrite’s best features is that it provides feedback on your writing and suggests ways to improve it.\n\nHelps with Character Creation: You can use it to create characters for your story and establish the relationships between them (more below).\n\nProvides Succinct Summaries: Sudowrite is adept at summarizing chunks of prose.\n\nFinds the Words: If you can’t find the words to describe an object, Sudowrite has a tool to help with that.\n\nUnleashes Your Inner Poet: Don’t know how to craft poems? No problem! Sudowrite has a feature for that.\n\nIn the next section, we’ll discuss the features that provide the benefits mentioned above in more detail.\n\nBest Features of Sudowrite\n\nSudowrite has many features and story tools that make writing prose with it a joy.\n\nIt has a Write feature that is fantastic for breaking past writer’s block, a Describe button that acts like a Thesaurus but for sentences; a Brainstorming tool that’s excellent for ideation, a Character generator that helps with characterization; and so much more.\n\nLet’s discuss some of the essential ones in this section.\n\nFirst Draft\n\nThe First Draft feature will take your story idea input and generate up to 1000 words – giving you a great first draft of your idea.\n\nExpand Feature\n\nThe Expand feature used to be called the Wormhole (due to the creators’ love for sci-fi). Think of it as autocomplete for writers.\n\nWhen you use this feature, Sudowrite looks at the text in your document and provides suggestions for subsequent paragraphs. Some of the tips fit so seamlessly into your prose that your readers won’t be able to tell where your sentence ends and the AI’s begins.\n\nOf course, this feature isn’t perfect. Sometimes, it may take your story in a completely different direction than you intended. However, with trial and error, you can get Sudowrite to do your bidding.\n\nRewrite Tool\n\nThe Rewrite tool is excellent for improving aspects of your story. Let’s say you’re writing a horror novel and want to give a scene a more ominous tone.\n\nWhen you describe the tone you want to write, Sudowrite will rewrite the passage and include foreboding vocabulary that’ll fit the tone you’ve described.\n\nThis tool compliments the Describe button. Also, it helps give your novel’s characters their own individual voice. And if you find yourself breaking the “show, don’t tell” rule often, you’ll be relying on this feature a lot.\n\nDescribe Feature\n\nThe “Describe” button has helped many writers when they’re at a loss for words. For example, if you can’t find the words to describe a boat, Sudowriter will give you some suggestions with sensory detail when you press the Describe button.\n\nAlso, Sudowriter offers metaphorical descriptions.\n\nTo use this feature, highlight a word and hit the Describe button. Sudowrite will provide paragraph-level suggestions (not just single words!) based on the five senses (sight, taste, touch, smell, and sound).\n\nBrainstorming Feature\n\nHave you ever wanted to create plot points but worried that you were writing yourself into a corner? The brainstorming feature will help you through such complex story problems. To use it, you need to supply Sudowrite with the problem you’re trying to create.\n\nFor example, if your story’s protagonist gets captured and you’re trying to figure out how they’ll escape, you can give Sudowrite the scene’s context using suggestions like “through a locked window” or “a small crack in the wall.” Sudowrite will respond by generating possible outcomes, helping you move your story forward.\n\nThen, you can give a thumbs-up to the Sudowrite suggestions you like the most, and it will train the AI to tailor future suggestions to your preferences.\n\nSummarize Feature\n\nThe Summarize feature does what it says: it summarizes chunks of text. For example, you can feed Sudowrite a handful of chapters from your book, and it will give you back an outline for each.\n\nSudowrite’s developers are currently tweaking the software to make it capable of summarizing an entire book into a one-pager. In the future, literary agents and publishers may be able to use the tool to create summaries for the books in their slush piles.\n\nBetaReader Feature\n\nIf you’d like to receive feedback on parts of your story but aren’t ready to show the prose to human readers, Sudowriter can help.\n\nThe software will generate three virtual beta readers that’ll offer helpful criticism on different aspects of a chapter. They can tell you what they liked or didn’t like about your story.\n\nPlease note that the BetaReader feature is one of Sudowriter’s experimental features, so your results with this may vary.\n\nCharacter Generator\n\nSudowrite’s Character Generator is excellent for brainstorming new characters in a story. If you’ve fleshed out the main characters of your story but you’re coming up short on who they’ll interact with and the dynamics of their relationships, this tool will be your friend.\n\nYou use it by providing Sudowrite with descriptions of your characters, i.e., their age, physical characteristics, job, etc. Sudowrite will take the data and return suggestions for an almost limitless number of characters and the interpersonal relationships between them.\n\nEven if you don’t find a character you like, you can piece a unique character together by taking parts from each of Sudowrite’s suggestions.\n\nTwist Feature\n\nSudowrite’s Twist feature is another incredible thing this software can do. As is suggestive of its name, you can use it to incorporate a plot twist into your story, and it lets you choose the genre of twist you need. So, if twists aren’t your strong suit, you can rely on this tool.\n\nWhen you give Sudowrite a short story description and use the Twist feature, the AI will use that information to send your plot in an unexpected direction. Like the BetaReader feature, the twist feature is experimental, meaning it won’t always return a twist that makes sense.\n\nPoetry Tool\n\nSudowrite isn’t just useful for writing stories. You can also use it to write poetry.\n\nYou can also use its Poetry tool in your stories. For example, you can use this tool to come up with song lyrics sung by a character in your novel. Ditto if your character is a poet and you don’t have a poetic bone in your body.\n\nStory Bible\n\nSudowrite’s Story Bible is an easy way for you to add everything about the story idea you have to Sudowrite. They walk you through adding your characters, setting, genre, tone, story outline, and tons of other things so that the AI has the best idea of the story you want to create. It then uses that information to assist you in writing your novel, short story or screenplay! Here’s how it looks:\n\nWho Should Use Sudowrite?\n\nSudowrite is a tool for creative writers, so novelists, screenwriters, and short story writers will get the most out of it. Published or independent authors who struggle with occasional writer’s block will also benefit.\n\nAlso, writers with sensory differences (e.g., a writer who is blind or deaf) will appreciate this tool’s Describe feature, especially how it provides vocabulary and descriptions for how things feel, smell, sound, look, and taste.\n\nIf you write short stories, Sudowrite can help you write your short story in no time at all. Different tools within the software can help accelerate this kind of writing, especially the Brainstorming and Expand features.\n\nAlso, screenwriters may find this software useful, if only for planning out the beats of their scripts. The brainstorming feature is excellent for building on rough ideas, which you can format for the screen.\n\nFinally, literary agents and publishing companies will likely want this tool when the Sudowrite team expands the AI’s summarizing capabilities. That feature will be fantastic for anyone with many books to read and summarize for publishing and marketing purposes.\n\nSudowrite Plans and Pricing\n\nSudowrite has three plans, and the following costs are if you pay yearly:\n\nHobby and Student Plan – costs $19/month (or $10 if you pay yearly) and provides 225,000 credits per month.\n\nProfessional Plan – costs $29/month and provides a million credits each month.\n\nMax Plan – costs $59/month and provides 2 million credits each month – these credits even roll over for up to 12 months so you get the best use out of the program!\n\nThe number of credits you use each month will depend on the AI model you choose to use within Sudowrite. The model you choose will be based on the genre of story you want to write (some of them will write NSFW content, for example, and others won’t), and the quality of the AI.\n\nIf you need a plan with enterprise-level features, you can contact the team at hi@sudowrite.com.\n\nSudowrite Pros and Cons\n\nSudowrite has a lot going for it. Not only is it affordable, but features like its Rewrite, Describe, and Brainstorming tools and Character Generator make story writing with the software fun.\n\nSudowrite’s main drawbacks are its lack of a plagiarism checker and some features that are still in the experimental stage. Considering this software is built on the Open AI GPT-3 engine means it is fed information that exists on the internet. Much of that information is subject to copyright so that a plagiarism checker would’ve been reassuring.\n\nLuckily, Sudowrite is just one of many AI writing tools, as the section below shows.\n\nSudowrite Alternatives\n\nIf you’re wondering what software competes with Sudowrite, here are a couple of alternatives you can use to create works of fiction.\n\nMy Experience Using Sudowrite\n\nCreating a new, free account using an email address was easy. After confirming my email, Sudowrite gave me a tour of the software program:\n\nHere’s the demo story it wrote for me:\n\nAfter I clicked the “write” button, Sudowrite was able to give me two different options for keeping the story going. I clicked to insert the option I liked best, and the software added it to my document.\n\nNext, the software showed me how to use the “describe” button to generate written descriptions of items (in this case, the “jacquard bathrobe.”\n\nHere are the options it gave me:\n\nThe descriptions it gave were (mostly) fantastic! They went in different creative directions (some were positive, and some had negative connotations) and could absolutely be used in a story.\n\nNext, I asked the software to create a new story for me, one using this prompt:\n\nHere’s the beginning of the story it wrote:\n\nNext, look below to see the whole story that it created. I copied and pasted it into a Google Doc and turned on the Grammarly grammar-checking extension. You can see that it found quite a few grammar mistakes and that using Grammarly with Sudowrite would help to make the story better.\n\nHonestly, the story was adorable and could be taken and adapted by a human writer into a fantastic short story!\n\nLike with all AI story generators, remember that this is just a tool to assist you with the first step of the story-making process. It’s still on you to personalize the raw material into a fully-fledged story.\n\nWho Created Sudowrite?\n\nAmit Gupta and James Yu, a pair of developers and science-fiction writers, created Sudowrite in 2020. to help other writers who struggle with writer’s block.\n\nThe Sudowrite creators count the founders of Medium, WordPress, Twitter, Rotten Tomatoes, and Gumroad among their backers and Hollywood writers and directors of movies like Ocean’s Twelve and The Bourne Ultimatum.\n\nThe creators of Sudowrite didn’t develop it to replace the “creative process” or replace the existing writing community with artificial intelligence. Instead, they created this AI writer to help creative writers fill the gaps in their writing and enhance the knowledge they’ve already acquired when honing their craft.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIf you struggle with writer’s block, Sudowrite will be a fantastic writing partner to have in your corner. It has many features that help you move your story forward in a fun way.\n\nStandouts include its Describe button, for when you can’t find the words, its Betareader feature, which provides AI feedback, and its Poetry tool. We can’t recommend it enough.\n\nAside from authors, creative professionals like publishers and literary agents will have much to look forward to as the Sudowrite team updates the tool.\n\nAnd, its affordable price point makes it an indispensable piece of tech to add to your creative writing arsenal if you harbor aspirations to see your written word in print.\n\nSo, grab your laptop and get creative!",
      "# [5 AI creative writing tools by David Burton on 2024-08-16](https://www.artshub.co.uk/news/features/5-ai-creative-writing-tools-2617465/)\nIf you’re ready to embrace the technological future, there’s a diverse range of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for creative writers available. While it’s feasible that AI could write your masterpiece for you, it probably won’t become the next literary award-winner. Overall, AI tools are best used as a means of generating ideas or first drafts, or correcting prose. Embraced in this way, AI can streamline your creative writing process.\n\nWhen considering these tools, it’s essential to know if the work you generate on the platforms will be used to train further AI models or possibly used in ways you didn’t intend. For more on the ethics of creative AI, take a look at the Senate inquiry into AI in Australia, and what concerns by the sector were tabled.\n\nGrammarly\n\nOne of the world’s most popular grammar checkers, Grammarly recently rebranded itself as AI writing assistance. Apart from offering a robust service for basic punctuation and grammar mistakes, Grammarly can use AI to check the tone of your writing and make suggestions. Ideal for professional emails and documents, Grammarly is also rare in its meaningful integration with Office 365 and most internet browsers.\n\nSudowrite\n\nIf nothing else, Sudowrite is a fun toy to play with. Sudowrite is designed for fiction writers. It’s in-browser app has a range of tools, including brainstorming names or locations. But its real thrill is in its Story Bible tool. It will take your unrefined brain dump and turn it into a synopsis, an outline, a chapter and a character breakdown. From there, it can generate a beat-by-beat summary for each chapter and even write it for you.\n\nYou can provide edits and nudges in the desired direction at each step. Sudowrite feels the most like the creative writing techno-dystopia that keeps editors and authors up at night. Still, when handled properly, it is most like a helpful, occasionally dim-witted co-writer. Sudowrite’s pricing is aggressive: a monthly subscription will net you a dedicated amount of AI hints, but you will need to pay extra if you run out. Writing an entire chapter, for example, is an expensive enterprise.\n\nJasper\n\nTaking the lead in blog writing, marketing copy and social media posts, Jasper is constructed to help an organisation with content marketing. It leverages your company’s established brand voice and style guide to begin generating content. It can build a content strategy for you, or work off one you have already created. You can use the Jasper app in-browser, but you can also use the Jasper API directly into code. Many other SEO (search engine optimisation) and content generation AI creative writing tools offer slight variants. Jasper remains one of the most popular.\n\nProWritingAid\n\nGeared towards journalists, academics and authors, ProWritingAid offers unique insight on your early drafts. It is not designed for content generation, but will offer a customised critique of your work, describing strengths, weaknesses and areas for improvement. Fiction writers can receive custom suggestions on plot enhancement, characters, setting and pace. It will also shorten or expand sections while maintaining your authorial voice. Among the spectrum of AI creative writing tools, it is also relatively inexpensive.\n\nRytr",
      "# [The 40 Best AI Tools in 2025 (Tried & Tested) by Ema Lukan on 2024-05-17](https://www.synthesia.io/post/ai-tools)\nThe Best AI Tools by Category\n\nChatbots: ChatGPT, Claude\n\nVideo Generation and Editing: Synthesia, Runway\n\nWriting: Rytr, Sudowrite\n\nGrammar and Writing Improvement: Grammarly, Wordtune\n\nSearch Engines: Perplexity, ChatGPT search\n\nSocial Media Management: Vista Social, FeedHive\n\nImage Generation: Midjourney, DALL·E 3\n\nGraphic Design: Canva Magic Studio, Looka\n\nApp Builders: Bubble, Bolt\n\nProject Management: Asana, ‎ClickUp\n\nTranscription and Meeting Assistants: tl;dv, Nyota\n\nScheduling: Reclaim, Clockwise\n\nCustomer Service: Tidio AI, Hiver\n\nRecruitment: Textio, CVViZ\n\nKnowledge Management: Notion AI Q&A, Guru\n\nEmail: Hubspot Email Writer, SaneBox, Shortwave\n\nPresentations: Gamma, Presentations.ai\n\nResume Builders: Teal, Kickresume\n\nVoice Generation: ElevenLabs, Murf\n\nMusic Generation: Suno, Udio\n\nHow I selected the tools in this list\n\nIn this article I list 40 AI tools across 20 different categories. After exploring all the available options in each category, I’ve carefully selected the two best tools based on my personal experience. This ensures that the recommendations come from real, practical use, so you can trust that they’re grounded in what actually works.\n\nFor each tool, I focus on its best use cases, explaining when and how it can be most useful. I also share what I love about each one, as well as any downsides I’ve encountered during my experience. Additionally, I provide information on the free version and premium pricing plans for each tool.\n\nFree AI tools\n\nIf you're looking for free AI tools, you're in luck! I made sure that every AI tool listed in this article offers either a free plan or free trial with no credit card required, allowing you to explore their features and functionality without any commitment.\n\nThe best AI chatbots\n\nCh‎atGPT\n\nChatGPT consistently ranks at the top of the LM Arena leaderboard, outperforming other models in key benchmarks. It's the world's most popular AI application, with 200 million users as of October 2024.\n\nI’ve used ChatGPT extensively for brainstorming ideas, translation tasks, coding, AI script generation, data analysis and managing research-heavy tasks. The new 4o model is a significant leap forward—it’s incredibly fast, and feels way smarter than any of the previous versions of ChatGPT.\n\nWith ChatGPT-4's multimodal capabilities I can paste in images—like a chart or graph—and ask questions about it, making it much easier to interpret visual data quickly. I fed it a PNG image of a chart and it analysed the chart, gave me a table of the raw data (that it read from the chart image) and then re-did the chart in my preferred colors - pretty impressive.\n\nChatGPT can now retain context over time, personalizing responses based on previous conversations. For instance, I’ve used it to refine recurring project ideas without re-explaining every detail, saving hours of effort. You can review and manage what it remembers through OpenAI’s controls, to make sure it doesn't go all Skynet on you.\n\nThe integrated ChatGPT search option (more on this later) makes it even easier to find relevant information directly within conversations, which cuts down on the hallucinations with the use of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). RAG grounds the AI's answer by retrieving information from external data sources.\n\nWhile it excels in creative and general-purpose tasks, I’d recommend exploring other tools like Claude (see below) for coding. It's not that ChatGPT is bad at coding tasks, it's just that Claude is great at them.\n\nChatGPT-4o mini is available to anyone free of charge. The Plus plan costs $20/month, and it’s worth every penny.\n\nCl‎aude\n\nI’ve been using Claude, developed by Anthropic, for coding tasks, and it’s quickly becoming my go-to for code reviews. What really makes Claude stand out is how precise it is—it seems to \"get\" the nuances of programming better than other tools I’ve tried. I’ve used it to spot subtle issues in my code and even brainstorm better ways to structure projects. Anthropic are training these models on more recent and specialized coding knowledge and it shows, especially when tackling modern frameworks or troubleshooting tricky bugs.\n\nAnother thing I love about Claude is how nice it is to talk to. It feels like it has more \"soul\" compared to ChatGPT—the tone is warmer, and conversations just flow better. Whether I’m bouncing around ideas or working through a complicated issue, it’s genuinely pleasant to interact with. I have quite reached Her levels of affection for Claude, but we're getting there.\n\nThat said, I have hit the response and rate limits a little faster than I’d like, which can be a hassle if I’m deep into a project. But for $20/month on the Pro plan, it’s still a great deal, especially if you’re looking for an AI assistant that’s smart, approachable, and particularly strong in coding tasks.\n\nTh‎e best AI video generators\n\nSy‎‎nthesia\n\nSynthesia is the leading AI video generator platform designed for professional video content with AI avatars. I’ve used it for creating training modules and presentations, and it’s clear why it’s a favorite for learning and development (L&D) teams. By turning text into video, Synthesia simplifies the production of high-quality content without the need for cameras, microphones, or studios.\n\nIts most popular use case is undoubtedly training and L&D videos, but Synthesia is versatile enough to handle a wide range of needs. Businesses use it for internal communications, onboarding new employees, and creating customer support or knowledge base videos. On the marketing side, it excels in producing personalized sales outreach videos, B2B marketing content, explainer videos and even product demos. I’ve personally also found it handy for website videos that needed a polished, professional touch with minimal effort.\n\nTwo things are love about Synthesia are the ability to customize avatars and the wide variety of templates offered. When I needed to create tailored training videos for different departments, Synthesia made it easy to switch the avatar language, tone, or background to suit the audience. The library of over 230 avatars and support for 140+ languages means you can create globally consistent content effortlessly.\n\nWhile Synthesia shines for corporate-style videos, it’s not designed for storytelling or cinematic visuals. It’s best for teams and businesses that prioritize speed, professionalism, and brand consistency in their video production workflows.\n\nSynthesia offers a free plan that allows users to generate up to 36 minutes of video per year, with no credit card required. For more extensive features, paid plans start at $29 per month.\n\nRu‎‎nway\n\nRunway is a powerful AI video creation platform packed with features like text-to-video, image-to-video, Motion Brush, Camera Controls, and Inpainting. I’ve mostly used its text-to-video tool to turn simple prompts into visually compelling videos for social media posts.\n\nTools like Motion Brush make it easy to add animations to specific parts of a video, while Camera Controls let you adjust angles and focus for a cinematic feel. The Inpainting feature is particularly impressive, allowing me to seamlessly remove or alter elements in a scene without disrupting the video’s continuity—tasks that usually require advanced skills and fancy video editing software. There is still a bit of a learning curve though, especially for newcomers to video editing.\n\nRunway’s pricing is flexible: the Standard Plan ($12/month) is great for light use, the Pro Plan ($28/month) offers more credits and features, and the Unlimited Plan ($144/month) is ideal for high-output creators or teams. Runway also offers the Basic plan. This plan provides individuals with 125 one-time credits for free. A very light version of Runway is also integrated into Canva so you can try it out there too.\n\nRunway shines for creatives like filmmakers, digital artists, and content creators looking to push boundaries. Though rendering times can occasionally lag for high-resolution videos, the results are worth it. For me, it’s become an essential tool for experimenting and achieving professional-quality outputs, whether for short-form content or storytelling projects.\n\nThe best AI writing tools\n\nRy‎tr\n\nI’ve used Rytr as an AI writing assistant for generating quick, polished content, and it’s a great alternative when you want something simple and efficient. It’s particularly effective for short-form writing tasks like social media posts, product descriptions, or email drafts. One thing that stands out is its collection of over 40 pre-designed templates, which help structure your content right from the start, saving time when you’re stuck on how to begin.\n\nCompared to ChatGPT, Rytr feels more focused and specialized for writing tasks. While ChatGPT is great for brainstorming and exploring ideas, Rytr is better when you need a ready-to-go format or a professional tone without much back-and-forth. It also comes with a built-in plagiarism checker, giving you peace of mind about originality, and supports over 30 languages, making it ideal for multilingual content creation.\n\nI’ve noticed, however, that Rytr struggles a bit with longer or more complex writing, so it’s not my first choice for in-depth articles. That said, for short-form content, it’s fast, effective, and affordable, with plans starting at just $9/month. If you’re a freelancer, small business owner, or marketer looking for a streamlined tool that gets the job done, Rytr is a solid pick.\n\nSu‎dowrite\n\nI'm an aspiring novelist in my spare time, so I snuck this one into the list.\n\nI’ve been using Sudowrite as a creative writing assistant, and it’s an excellent tool for anyone working on fiction. It’s ideal for overcoming writer’s block, generating fresh ideas, and crafting more vivid narratives. Features like the ‘Describe’ tool, which helps create immersive descriptions, and ‘Brainstorm,’ which sparks creative plot points, have significantly improved my storytelling process. The ‘Expand’ feature is also useful for turning rough outlines into fully developed drafts.\n\nUnlike ChatGPT or Rytr, Sudowrite isn’t designed for creating emails, product descriptions, or blog posts. Its focus is entirely on fiction—helping you write better dialogue, build richer characters, and refine your narrative structure. For instance, when I was stuck on a scene, Sudowrite provided thoughtful suggestions to enhance the pacing and tension. It's the ultimate weapon against writers block - even if you don't end up using what it comes up with, it'll still get you thinking about the next sentence in a different way.\n\nWhile it’s not suitable for business writing or technical content, it’s a fantastic choice for novelists, short story writers, or anyone experimenting with creative projects. With plans starting at $19/month, Sudowrite offers a unique way to elevate your fiction writing.\n\nThe best AI grammar checkers\n\nGr‎ammarly\n\nI've been using Grammarly to enhance my writing for years, and now it has a bunch of AI-powered features. Beyond the usual catching grammar and spelling errors, Grammarly offers tone adjustments, strategic suggestions, and full-sentence rewrites.\n\nGrammarly's new AI writing assistant generates content ideas and assists in drafting emails and documents, and is integrated directly into various platforms, including Gmail, Google Docs, and Microsoft Word, providing real-time suggestions as I write. These integrations have made it easier for me to maintain consistency and professionalism across the different writing tasks I'm faced with on a typical work day.\n\nWhile Grammarly excels in refining and enhancing existing text, it's not designed for generating long-form content from scratch. However, for editing and improving drafts, its AI features are must-have. There's a free version covering basic corrections and a premium plan starting at $30/month.\n\nWo‎rdtune\n\nAnother tool I've been using to refine my writing is Wordtune. Unlike Grammarly, which focuses primarily on grammar and spelling corrections, Wordtune excels in rephrasing sentences to improve clarity, tone, and style.\n\nOne feature I find particularly useful is the ability to switch between formal and casual tones with a single click, allowing me to tailor my writing to different audiences effortlessly. Additionally, Wordtune offers advanced AI proofreading capabilities, ensuring that my spelling, grammar, and phrasing are all spot-on before I hit 'send'.\n\nWordtune also provides contextual suggestions that complement my writing, creating content that perfectly matches my style, tone, and subject matter. This has been invaluable in maintaining consistency across all of my writing.\n\nWhile Wordtune is excellent for rewriting and enhancing existing text, it's not designed for generating long-form content from scratch. However, for editing and improving drafts, it provides some useful features that aren't quite covered by Grammarly. With a free version covering basic features and premium plans starting at $13.99/month, Wordtune offers a range of tools to elevate your writing.\n\nThe best AI search engines\n\nPe‎rplexity\n\nPerplexity is more of a research engine than a search engine. Unlike traditional tools like Google, it doesn’t make you sift through a maze of links—instead, it provides direct answers with citations, making it far more efficient for knowledge work. That said, you still need to verify its responses, as some answers, particularly for technical queries, can rely on outdated information. I’ve seen it cite decade-old sources when I was testing it with some questions about CAD software, which wasn't great.\n\nWhere Perplexity truly stands out is its ability to surface results I wouldn’t have thought to search for. I use it to explore a topic from multiple angles, and its multi-step reasoning engine makes it ideal for in-depth research and synthesis. You can see it automatically detect when an extra search will lead to a better answer and then it starts working through each part of the query step-by-step.\n\nFor those looking for even more functionality, Perplexity Pro is worth checking out. The Pro version costs $20/month and offers faster responses and more detailed answers, significantly improving the overall experience.\n\nThe free version is great for casual use, but if you rely on Perplexity for heavy research, the Pro plan is a solid investment.\n\nCh‎atGPT search\n\nWhat I love about ChatGPT Search is how quick it is. It retrieves information at insane speed, while still offering deliberate reasoning when processing complex queries. This makes it incredibly effective for quickly answering questions or diving into more detailed topics without losing the conversational flow. That's the key point here - it feels like you're having a natural conversation with someone who knows everything.\n\nThere's also an option to ask for more details. Instead of just delivering a single response, ChatGPT Search acts like a guide, helping you explore a subject deeply, clarify concepts, and resolve any doubts. This interactive approach makes it ideal for tackling complex topics or learning in a more intuitive way.\n\nThat said, like all LLM-based search engines, it has its limitations. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stage can sometimes produce subpar results, and the tool has a tendency to justify its search outcomes with certainty—even when they aren’t entirely accurate. For this reason, I always double-check important information.\n\nChatGPT Search is included with premium plans like ChatGPT Plus ($20/month), and it’s a valuable addition for those who need fast, flexible, and deeply interactive search capabilities. It also recently rolled out with limited capabilities for free users too.\n\nThe best AI for social media\n\nVi‎sta Social\n\nI tried using Vista Social to manage our social media accounts, and it's quickly become an indispensable tool. Its comprehensive suite of features allows me to plan, collaborate, and schedule content across all my social channels seamlessly. The visual scheduling and preview capabilities are particularly helpful, enabling me to see exactly how my posts will appear before they go live.\n\nThe AI Assistant leverages ChatGPT to generate engaging captions and message replies and saves a bunch of time. Additionally, the platform's engagement tools consolidate all my social media messages, comments, and reviews in one place, making it easier to keep on top of things and build relationships with our audience. Vista Social also offers robust analytics and reporting tools, allowing me to measure the performance of my campaigns and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nVista Social is ideal for small to medium-sized businesses, marketing agencies, and individual content creators who need a comprehensive, affordable tool for managing social media. However, larger enterprises or teams with complex needs might find its features less robust compared to enterprise-level platforms, especially if they require advanced CRM integration or highly customized analytics.\n\nWith plans starting at $39/month, including planning and publishing tools, engagement features, AI assistance, and detailed reporting, Vista Social offers a lot of value for its price. It’s a user-friendly solution for anyone looking to simplify their social media management process.\n\nFe‎edHive\n\nI also loved FeedHive. Its AI-driven features, like content suggestions and hashtag recommendations, have been particularly useful for brainstorming posts when I’m short on ideas. Scheduling content is a breeze, and the visual previews help me make sure everything looks perfect before it goes live. I also appreciate how easy it is to adjust posts for different platforms within the same interface—it saves so much time.\n\nThe analytics dashboard is another highlight. I’ve used it to track follower activity and post performance, which has helped me identify what resonates most with my audience. FeedHive’s collaboration tools are handy too—I’ve been able to share drafts with my boss and get quick approvals without switching between apps.\n\nThat said, I’ve noticed its social listening capabilities are limited. If you’re looking to monitor brand mentions or trends in real time, you might find it lacking compared to other platforms. Vista Social offers more advanced engagement tools and social listening, though at a higher price point.\n\nFeedHive is lightweight and affordable, starting at $19/month, which makes it a great fit for freelancers and small businesses. It’s been a reliable option for creating and scheduling content, especially if you want something simple yet effective.\n\nThe best AI image generators\n\nMi‎djourney\n\nMidjourney remains my favorite AI image generator for painterly and imaginative visuals. Its artistic strength lies in its ability to create stunning fantasy and sci-fi imagery or richly textured \"historical\" photos.\n\nOne area where Midjourney shines is in its painterly aesthetic, particularly for faces and intricate details in surreal contexts. I’ve noticed it struggles with rendering faces at a distance, but for speculative and narrative-driven artwork—like a dreamy space opera or a mythical kingdom—Midjourney is unmatched.\n\nFor grounded realism, I rely on DALL-E 3, but when crafting vibrant, otherworldly scenes or highly conceptual art, Midjourney is my go-to tool.\n\nLike DALL-E 3, it lacks the ability to define reusable characters or objects, a feature that would massively enhance its value for consistent visual storytelling.\n\nMidjourney offers both free and premium plans. The free plan allows users to create a small number of images, while the premium plans offers more generations, faster processing, and access to additional tools. The cheapest premium option is the basic plan which cost me $10/month.\n\nDA‎LL·E 3\n\nDALL-E 3 is OpenAI’s latest iteration in text-to-image models and is now natively integrated into ChatGPT. This integration makes creating images more intuitive—you can brainstorm prompts directly with ChatGPT, refining them from simple descriptions to detailed narratives. It’s like having a creative collaborator that brings your ideas to life visually.\n\nFor me, DALL-E 3 is my go-to for photorealistic renders or scenes with multiple clear \"actors.\" It’s excellent for grounded, realistic depictions, like rendering battle scenes for a fighting game prompt or creating lifelike images of animals or people. The enhancements in understanding complex prompts make DALL-E 3 far more reliable than its predecessor.\n\nThat said, a limitation across tools like DALL-E 3 is the inability to define and \"remember\" reusable characters, locations, or objects. For instance, the ability to save a character design as \"Paul\" and reuse it consistently across projects would be groundbreaking for storytelling or brand design.\n\nDALL-E 3 is the ideal tool for anyone seeking photorealistic imagery or grounded scenes, especially when collaborating with ChatGPT to fine-tune your creative vision.\n\nThe best AI design tools\n\nCa‎nva Magic Studio\n\nCanva has long been my go-to design tool (because it's so easy to use), and the addition of its AI-powered Magic Studio suite takes it to the next level with a variety of features that simplify and enhance the creative process. These features are:\n\nMagic Design: By inputting a prompt or uploading an image, Magic Design generates personalized templates for various formats like social media posts and presentations. This has been particularly useful when I'm short on inspiration, providing a solid starting point for my social media posts\n\nMagic Write: This tool assists in crafting content by generating text based on your prompts. I've found it helpful for drafting copy and sparking ideas when I have writers block\n\nMagic Edit: Magic Edit allows for seamless modifications within images, such as changing colors or removing elements. It's been invaluable for making quick adjustments without needing to switch to a separate (and more complicated) photo editing tool\n\nMagic Eraser: This feature enables the removal of unwanted objects from images. I've used it to clean up photos before I add them to a social media post\n\nMagic Animate: Magic Animate brings static designs to life by adding animations - great for creating engaging presentations and social media content that capture the attention\n\nRegarding pricing, Canva offers a freemium model. You can try some Magic Studio tools for free, with certain limitations. For instance, Magic Write can be used up to 50 times in total for free. Upgrading to Canva Pro ($15/month) or Canva for Teams ($30/month for 3 seats) increases this limit to 250 times per person, per month.\n\nMagic Studio is ideal for individuals and teams looking to enhance their design capabilities without extensive experience. It's particularly beneficial for small businesses, marketers, and content creators who need to produce high-quality visuals.\n\nLo‎oka\n\nLooka is an AI-powered logo design platform that makes branding simple and effective. I’ve used it for creating a logo for one of my side projects (an Airbnb property management company), and I was very pleased with the results. After entering my project name and choosing styles and colors, Looka generated several options that looked polished and professional. It’s incredibly user-friendly, even if you have zero design experience.\n\nThat's why I love Looka - the simplicity. Once I selected a design I liked, I could easily adjust the fonts, colors, and layouts to fine-tune the final result without feeling overwhelmed. The final logo looked so good that I downloaded the accompanying Brand Kit, which included matching social media templates and business card designs. Having everything ready-to-go saved me hours of extra work.\n\nWhile Looka doesn’t offer the depth of customization you’d get with a professional designer, it’s perfect for small businesses or personal projects where time and cost are important. It’s simple, effective, and delivers great results that I’ve been really happy with.\n\nLooka offers two primary pricing options:\n\nLogo-Only Packages: One-time purchases that include logo files in various formats. The Basic package is priced at $20, while the Premium package costs $65.\n\nBrand Kit Subscriptions: Annual subscriptions providing access to a comprehensive brand kit with over 300 customizable assets. The standard Brand Kit is $96 per year, and the Brand Kit with an AI-generated website is $129 per year.\n\nThe best AI app builders\n\nBo‎lt\n\nGetting a bit more technical now, but if I managed it then you can too! This tool blew me away.\n\nBolt.new is an AI-powered platform that allows you to quickly prototype, run, edit, and deploy full-stack applications directly from your browser. I decided to give it a try by building a simple web application for managing tasks.\n\nBuilding an app on the platform was fast and intuitive. I typed a prompt describing the app—“Build a task manager with a to-do list, user authentication, and a simple dashboard”—and Bolt.new generated a working prototype. From there, I was able to refine the design and functionality using the built-in editor. I added a delete button to each task and adjusted the styling using the code editor and it all seemed to work fine.\n\nWhat I found most impressive was that it can deploy the apps for you. Once I was happy with the app, I clicked “deploy,” and boom, the app was live. The platform handled everything—from hosting to managing serverless functions, it all saved me a ton of time compared to setting up everything manually in a local development environment. It's perfect for prototyping an app.\n\nBolt.new supports frameworks and libraries like React, Next.js, and Vite, so you can probably still use your preferred tech stack. The AI also helped with code generation and debugging to such an extent that I actually didn't use Claude while I was working on my mini-app.\n\nBolt.new isn't the best fit for complex projects that require extensive business logic or integration with third-party services. For more intricate systems or advanced features, you'll still need a real developer.\n\nAll in all, I found Bolt.new to be an excellent tool for quickly building and deploying web applications, especially for rapid prototypes or smaller projects. If you're looking to develop something fast and don't want to worry about managing the backend or hosting, it’s a fantastic option.\n\nBolt.new offers a free plan that provides a daily allocation of 100,000 tokens. The Pro Plan is available at $18 per month, offering 10 million tokens per month.\n\nBu‎bble\n\nIf you don't want to do any coding at all, then Bubble might be a better option. Bubble is a no-code platform that empowers users to build fully functional web applications. To test it out, I tried using it to develop a custom project management tool.\n\nThe platform's drag-and-drop editor allowed me to design the user interface by placing elements like buttons, text fields, and images directly onto the canvas. I could define workflows to specify how the app should respond to user interactions, such as creating tasks or sending notifications. Bubble's built-in database management enabled me to set up data structures and relationships without needing to manage a separate database.\n\nOne feature I found particularly useful was the ability to integrate third-party APIs. For instance, I connected the app to a calendar service to synchronize deadlines, enhancing my tool's usefulness. Bubble also offers a plugin marketplace which really extends the platform's capabilities.\n\nWhile Bubble is powerful, it does still have a learning curve. Understanding how to structure data and workflows effectively took some time. There's a good level of support available via the documentation and community forums, so if you're willing to put some effort in you'll definitely be able to get the results you want.\n\nBubble is an excellent choice for entrepreneurs and small businesses looking to create custom web applications without the need for extensive coding knowledge. I think it's pretty amazing that you can build such a wide range of applications without writing any code whatsoever.\n\nBubble is tailored for users seeking a no-code solution with a focus on visual design and workflow management, whereas Bolt.new leverages AI to provide a more hands-on development experience with full-stack capabilities directly in the browser.\n\nBubble offers a Free Plan that allows users to build and prototype applications without any cost. Their Personal Plan is priced at $32 per month.\n\nThe best AI project management tools\n\nAs‎ana\n\nAsana is a comprehensive work management platform designed to help teams plan, track, and manage projects efficiently. It offers a range of tools for task management, project tracking, and team collaboration.\n\nAsana has integrated a number of AI-powered features. One notable addition is the Smart Status feature, which provides quick updates on the status of projects and tasks.\n\nAnother of their AI tools is Smart Chat, an AI-powered assistant that delivers answers to project management questions. This feature has been particularly useful in my experience, as it offers immediate assistance with project-related queries, reducing the time spent searching for information.\n\nAdditionally, Asana has introduced Smart Summaries, which automatically generate concise overviews of tasks and projects, helping teams quickly grasp key information. This feature is great for reviewing project progress and ensuring that all my team members are aligned and informed.\n\nAll of these AI enhancements automate routine tasks and provide valuable insights, allowing me to focus more on the more strategic aspects of project management and less on the admin.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that while Asana offers a robust set of features, some key functionalities are gated behind higher-tier plans, which may be a consideration for teams with budget constraints.\n\nAsana offers a free plan for up to 10 users with basic features. To access the AI features, you'll need the Starter Plan at $13.49 per user per month, which includes all basic features plus AI enhancements.\n\nCl‎ickUp\n\nClickUp is a comprehensive project management platform designed to enhance team collaboration.\n\nUpon signing up, I was greeted with an intuitive interface that allowed me to create tasks, set deadlines, and assign responsibilities with ease. The platform offers various views—such as List, Board, and Calendar—that cater to different project management styles. I found the Board view particularly useful for visualizing task progress, similar to Kanban boards.\n\nClickUp lets me break down projects into subtasks, set priorities, and track time spent on each task. The real-time collaboration feature enabled my team members to comment on tasks, share files, and receive instant notifications about updates. It's all very elegant and calmed my OCD.\n\nThere's loads of nifty little automations you can do. A very simple example is that I set up an automation to move tasks to a \"Completed\" status once all subtasks were checked off. You can get way more complex that than, but it's a good example of how ClickUp's automation features can make everything flow more easily. The platform also integrates with various third-party tools like Slack, Google Drive, and GitHub, which keeps everything nice and neat.\n\nClickUp's AI capabilities assist in drafting project plans, generating meeting agendas, and summarizing documents. I used the AI to draft a project outline, and it provided a structured framework that I could further customize, which was a great help.\n\nClickUp is ideal for teams of all sizes seeking a comprehensive project management solution. Its flexibility makes it suitable for pretty much any project management use case. The platform's scalability ensures it can adapt to both small startups and large enterprises.\n\nClickUps offers a free plan that includes unlimited tasks, docs, and members, with 100MB storage. To access ClickUp's AI features, you'll need to subscribe to a paid plan with the cheapest being the Unlimited Plan at $10 per user per month.\n\nThe best AI meeting assistants\n\ntl‎;dv\n\ntl;dv is an AI-powered tool designed to make virtual meetings more efficient by automating transcriptions and providing summaries. I started using it with my team to improve how we manage meeting notes and ensure no important information gets lost.\n\nSetting it up is a piece of cake - all I had to do was link it to our Zoom account, and it automatically started transcribing meetings. The transcription itself was impressively accurate, with only a few minor hiccups with technical terms that needed manual fixes, but nothing major.\n\nWhat I really liked about tl;dv was how it automatically generated summaries at the end of each meeting. These summaries highlighted key decisions, action items, and important discussions, so anyone who couldn’t attend could easily catch up. This feature became especially useful for our remote team members who weren’t always in the loop during live meetings. I'm also just terrible at taking notes in a meeting, so it's been amazing to be able to review the action items my boss set for me without having to bother her again.\n\nThe platform also flagged key moments during meetings, making it easy to find specific topics later without having to listen to the entire recording again. This saved me a ton of time when reviewing meeting recordings to pull out important details. However, I did notice that the AI sometimes had trouble accurately identifying more nuanced or technical discussions, so I still needed to do a quick manual check.\n\nWhile tl;dv was incredibly helpful, I did wish the editing features were more robust. For instance, if I needed to clean up or adjust the transcription, it didn’t allow for in-depth editing within the platform. Even though that was a bit of a drawback, the ease of use and the speed with which tl;dv summarized meetings made it worth the small trade-off.\n\nIn the end, tl;dv has been a game-changer for how we manage meetings. It’s helped me stay more organized and efficient, and I’ve found myself using it regularly. The automation it offers has really freed up time for more meaningful work, and I can definitely see this type of AI tool becoming a staple for more teams in the future. It’s not perfect, but it’s incredibly useful and especially so if you're working remotely/from home a lot.\n\ntl;dv offers a free Plan with unlimited meetings and viewers. The Pro Plan costs $29/user/month and gives you unlimited access to the AI features.\n\nNy‎ota\n\nNyota is another AI-powered meeting assistant designed to enhance productivity by automating note-taking, task management, and meeting planning.\n\nI connected Nyota to our calendar and it automatically joined scheduled meetings. During meetings, Nyota captured key points, decisions, and action items, allowing me to stay fully engaged in the discussion without the distraction of manual note-taking.\n\nPost-meeting, Nyota provided detailed transcripts and concise summaries, highlighting essential information and assigned tasks. This feature was particularly beneficial for team members who couldn't attend, as they could quickly catch up on critical discussions.\n\nNyota's has some cool meeting planning capabilities. It offered AI-generated suggestions for relevant topics, ensuring our meetings were focused and productive. Additionally, Nyota integrated with our project management tools, automatically creating tasks and updates based on meeting discussions.\n\nWhile Nyota's features were comprehensive, I found that it had a similar issue as tl;dv in that its editing capabilities for transcripts were somewhat limited. Additionally, while Nyota excelled in capturing meeting content, it didn't offer the same depth in post-meeting analytics as some other tools. These analytics typically measure aspects of the meeting, for example if everyone got a chance to speak, which sounds weird but can really help get everyone contributing to the discussion in an unbiased way.\n\nIn comparison to tl;dv, another AI meeting assistant, Nyota provided a more holistic approach by integrating meeting notes with project management tools. While tl;dv focused on transcription and summarization, Nyota's strength lay in its ability to connect meeting insights directly to project tasks and planning.\n\nNyota offers a Starter Plan at $12/month with basic features like meeting note-taking. There's a 7-day free trial.\n\nThe best AI scheduling assistants\n\nRe‎claim\n\nReclaim is an AI-powered scheduling assistant that helps optimize your calendar by automatically managing tasks, meetings, and breaks according to your priorities. I started using Reclaim to manage my schedule more effectively, and it’s made a big difference in how I organize my time.\n\nOnce I linked Reclaim to my Google Calendar, I entered all my tasks and meetings, along with their respective priority levels. The AI then adjusted my calendar and automatically assigned time slots for each task. This took a lot of the mental load off my plate and made sure I wasn’t overlooking important commitments.\n\nThe tool identifies the best times for deep work and blocks those hours off to prevent meetings from taking over. This was especially helpful for making sure my most important tasks were tackled without interruptions.\n\nReclaim also helps with scheduling meetings. It automatically finds the best times that work for everyone, taking into account existing events and personal preferences. This made coordinating with my team much easier, saving time that would normally be spent going back and forth on availability.\n\nHowever, there were a few areas where Reclaim could improve. The AI sometimes misinterpreted the priority of certain tasks, which led to less optimal scheduling decisions. Additionally, I found the customization options for categorizing tasks to be a bit limiting.\n\nI found that Reclaim offered a more well-rounded approach by handling both tasks and meetings. Clockwise (more details below) excels at optimizing meeting times, but Reclaim's ability to manage a wider range of events made it more useful overall for my needs.\n\nReclaim offers a Lite Plan at no cost, providing essential smart time-blocking features. The Starter Plan costs $10 per user per month.\n\nCl‎ockwise\n\nClockwise is an AI-powered scheduling assistant designed to optimize your calendar by intelligently managing meetings and creating uninterrupted focus time. Since I began using Clockwise I've found it to be a valuable tool in organizing my workday.\n\nAfter integrating Clockwise with my Google Calendar, I marked certain meetings as flexible. The AI then analyzed my schedule and automatically rescheduled these meetings to create longer blocks of focus time. This adjustment allowed me to dedicate uninterrupted periods to deep work, which had a noticeable impact on the amount of work I got done on a typical day.\n\nClockwise also facilitated easier meeting coordination. It automatically found the best times for meetings, considering all participants' availability and existing commitments. This feature streamlined the scheduling process, reducing the back-and-forth typically involved in finding suitable meeting times.\n\nHowever, I did encounter some limitations. Clockwise makes the same mistake that Relcaim does of occasionally misinterpreting the priority of certain tasks, leading to some wacky scheduling decisions.\n\nIn comparison to Reclaim, another AI scheduling assistant, Clockwise provided a more focused approach by optimizing meeting times and creating focus periods. While Reclaim offered a broader range of features, including task management.\n\nClockwise offers a Free Plan with access to intelligent calendar management features. Their paid plans start at $6.75 per month but you have to pay an annual bill.\n\nThe best AI tools for customer service\n\nTi‎dio AI\n\nTidio is a customer service platform that integrates AI-driven tools.\n\nTidio's main AI feature is the Lyro AI Chatbot, designed to handle up to 70% of customer inquiries. I implemented Lyro to manage common questions and tasks, allowing our human customer service agents to focus on complex issues.\n\nThe chatbot's natural language processing capabilities enabled it to understand and respond to customer queries effectively. For instance, when one of our customers inquired about product specifications, Lyro provided detailed information and resolved the customer's query successfully. This had a hugely positive impact on our response times and customer satisfaction scores.\n\nAnother valuable tool is the Reply Assistant, which leverages GPT-4 technology to transform basic responses into professional, contextually relevant messages. I loved this feature because it improves the quality of our support team's replies. By inputting a simple response, the AI suggested more polished and informative alternatives, ensuring consistent and high-quality communication. This also helped get the team's support for these new AI features as they saw how it was going to supplement their efforts, rather than replace them.\n\nTidio's Smart Views feature offers real-time insights into customer interactions, allowing support agents to prioritize and manage conversations effectively. The ability to see which customers are online and what pages they're viewing enabled proactive engagement, leading to quicker issue resolution.\n\nThe platform also provides comprehensive analytics and reporting tools. I used these to track the performance of AI features, such as response times and customer satisfaction ratings. The data revealed that Lyro handled a significant portion of inquiries, allowing human agents to address more complex cases.\n\nTidio offers a 7-day free trial. Their starter plan at $29/month gives you 50 Lyro AI conversations.\n\nHi‎ver\n\nHiver is an AI-powered customer service platform designed to help teams manage shared inboxes like support and sales emails. I started using Hiver to streamline our team’s email management and improve our customer service response times. The integration with Gmail made it very easy to adopt.\n\nOne feature I found particularly useful was the AI Summarizer. With a lot of email threads piling up, it can be time-consuming to read through long chains of emails to get to the key points. The AI Summarizer condenses these conversations into quick, digestible summaries, highlighting the most important details like decisions, tasks, and follow-ups. This feature helped me stay on top of conversations without getting bogged down by lengthy threads. It’s a huge time-saver, especially when handling multiple customer inquiries simultaneously.\n\nAnother tool I appreciated was the AI Bot – Harvey, which automatically filters out redundant or low-priority emails, such as auto-replies or basic queries that don’t require much attention. It helped keep our inbox cleaner and allowed me and my colleagues to focus on the more complex requests. We saw a noticeable reduction in our average query handling time because of this feature.\n\nThe Analytics and Reporting tools were another highlight for me. I was able to easily track our performance with metrics like response times, customer satisfaction ratings, and the volume of tickets handled by the AI bot. This insight was valuable for identifying areas where we could improve and optimizing how we allocate tasks between the AI and our human team members.\n\nThat said, while Hiver is a powerful tool, I did find that there were times when the AI Summarizer missed some nuances in long email threads, requiring a manual review. Additionally, while Harvey was great at filtering out simpler inquiries, it occasionally flagged some queries as redundant that actually required attention, which led to some minor delays.\n\nI loved this platform, but I still see room for more flexibility in customizing the AI’s decision-making process, especially when it comes to complex inquiries. Overall, Hiver has been incredibly helpful in improving how we manage customer support emails. It saved me time by automating repetitive tasks and helped our team focus on delivering better, more personalized support.\n\nHiver’s Free Plan includes 1 shared inbox and basic features like live chat and knowledge base. The Lite Plan at $24 per user/month adds 2 shared inboxes, light automation, analytics, and integrations.\n\nThe best AI tools for recruitment\n\nTe‎xtio\n\nTextio is an AI-powered platform designed to enhance the quality and inclusivity of recruitment communications, particularly job postings. I began using Textio to improve some job descriptions for open positions we have on our team and found it to be a valuable tool in attracting a diverse pool of candidates.\n\nI found particularly useful was the Textio Score, which evaluates the effectiveness of the language used in job postings. It provides a numerical score indicating how likely the posting is to attract diverse applicants. The score is based on a number of factors and by adjusting the language based on Textio's suggestions, I was able to improve the score, leading to a more inclusive and appealing job description.\n\nWhile some tools offer features like resume screening or candidate matching, Textio's emphasis on crafting effective and unbiased job postings provides a unique advantage in attracting a diverse talent pool.\n\nTextio offers a 14-day free trial for users to explore its platform.\n\nCV‎ViZ\n\nCVViZ is an AI-powered recruitment platform designed to streamline the hiring process by automating tasks such as job posting, resume screening, and candidate engagement. I found it to be a valuable tool in attracting and selecting qualified candidates.\n\nCVViZ gives you the ability to automate job postings across multiple platforms. By integrating with over 2,000 job boards worldwide, CVViZ allows you to publish job ads to 20+ free and 1,700+ paid job sites with a single click.\n\nCVViZ intelligently matches and ranks resumes, helping you identify the best candidates early in the recruitment process. When we tried it out for a role we're hiring for on our team, CVViZ highlighted top candidates based on their alignment that actually looked like decent candidates.\n\nThe platform offers tools to engage and track candidates effectively. It enables you to communicate with candidates, schedule interviews, and make job offers within the system. CVViZ is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), acting as an intelligent layer on top of your current recruitment management system.\n\nThe platform provides detailed analytics and reporting features, offering insights into sourcing channels, team performance, and time-to-fill metrics.\n\nCVViZ offers a 7-day free trial. Their Starter Plan is available at $99 per month.\n\nThe best AI knowledge management tools\n\nNo‎tion AI Q&A\n\nNotion AI Q&A is a powerful tool that allows users to access a company's knowledge base across thousands of Notion pages. I first started using it in my new job, and it quickly became one of my favorite AI tools.\n\nAs an introvert, having the ability to ask any question (without bothering anyone) and instantly receive a detailed, accurate answer—powered by the collective knowledge stored across the company's Notion workspace—was incredibly empowering. It felt like having a personal assistant who could provide information from all corners of the company at any time.\n\nNotion AI Q&A is especially valuable compared to tools like Google Drive search. It doesn’t just give you links to documents but actually provides relevant answers pulled directly from the content, making it much quicker to get to the heart of a question. This saved me countless hours when I needed quick answers to detailed inquiries.\n\nHowever, while the desktop experience is smooth, I’ve faced some frustrating issues on Android, particularly with my Pixel 8 running Android 14. The app tends to freeze, lag, or glitch quite a bit, making it difficult to rely on it when I’m on the go. Or I could just buy an iPhone I suppose.\n\nOne other negative is the pricing. Notion AI is priced as an add-on feature, costing $10 per member each month ($8 when paying annual), which is quite reasonable given the benefits, but can add up pretty quickly if you are a big team. I still think it's worth it though.\n\nFor companies with large internal knowledge bases, I think Notion AI Q&A is an essential tool for simplifying information retrieval and making knowledge accessible to everyone, regardless of their role or level of expertise.\n\nGu‎ru\n\nGuru is an AI-powered knowledge management platform designed to centralize and streamline access to company information. In my experience, integrating Guru into our workflow significantly enhanced our team's efficiency and collaboration. Guru integrates with Slack, Teams, Salesforce, and pretty much every other platform you can think of.\n\nUpon implementation, Guru allowed us to access verified knowledge directly within our communication channels, reducing the need to switch between platforms. The AI-powered search functionality was particularly impressive, delivering relevant information based on context, history, role, and location.\n\nGuru's AI Training Center, enabled us to review and improve AI-generated answers, ensuring accuracy and relevance.\n\nThe platform's verification system ensured that the information we accessed was up-to-date and reliable. Automated reminders prompted subject matter experts to keep content fresh, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.\n\nGuru is ideal for teams seeking a comprehensive knowledge management solution that integrates seamlessly with existing workflows. The downside is that it's a bit pricey at $15/user/month - almost double what Notion AI costs.\n\nThe best AI email assistants\n\nHu‎bSpot AI Email Writer\n\nHubSpot offers an AI-powered email assistant designed to kickstart your creative juices and help write up personalized emails at scale. The platform’s AI assistant generates copy fit for various email campaigns, like sales outreach, marketing newsletters, and so on.\n\nYou can then edit or repurpose generated drafts by automatically changing their tones as well as lengthening or shortening them. HubSpot also includes a drag-and-drop email template builder with numerous customizable use-case-specific presets, perfect for further streamlining creative processes.\n\nWhat I found most useful is that HubSpot’s AI email writer links with the platform’s CRM database. That means you can roll out email campaigns and automatically log conversations to your contact lists. From there, you can track progress and send out follow-ups at the right time to maximize response rates. Plus, you can use the platform’s AI assistant directly from your Gmail account, which spares you the need to juggle between multiple tabs.\n\nHubSpot’s AI Email Writer is a solid choice for busy marketing and sales teams looking to scale up their efforts and maximize results without increasing headcount.\n\nThe email writing assistant is available for free, while more advanced email functionalities are available throughout HubSpot’s Marketing Hub paid packages. Pricing starts at $15 per month.\n\nSa‎neBox\n\nSaneBox is an AI-driven email management tool designed to help users declutter their inboxes by intelligently sorting incoming emails.\n\nSetting up Sanebox involved connecting it to my Gmail account, and then the service began analyzing my email habits to categorize incoming messages. It created folders such as SaneLater for less urgent emails and SaneBlackHole for unwanted senders. This initial configuration required minimal effort and was completed within minutes.\n\nSaneBox's AI effectively filtered emails based on my past interactions. Important messages from frequent contacts appeared in my main inbox, while newsletters and promotional emails were directed to the SaneLater folder.\n\nBeyond sorting, SaneBox offers features like snoozing emails and setting reminders for follow-ups. The snooze function allowed me to temporarily remove non-urgent emails from my inbox and have them return at a more convenient time. The reminder feature ensured I followed up on important emails, preventing tasks from slipping through the cracks.\n\nWhile SaneBox significantly improved my email organization, there were a few drawbacks. The service occasionally misclassified emails, directing important messages to the SaneLater folder. Additionally, I can imagine that the daily digest of filtered emails could be overwhelming, especially during periods of high email volume.\n\nOverall, SaneBox offers a comprehensive suite of features that go beyond basic filtering. Its AI-driven approach to email sorting and additional functionalities like snoozing and reminders make managing your inbox more efficient and less stressful.\n\nSaneBox offers a 14-day free trial. After the trial, the Snack Plan at $7 per month provides access to two features on a single email account.\n\nSh‎ortwave\n\nShortwave is an AI-powered email client with features such as AI email summarization, language translation, and task management.\n\nAfter connecting it to my Gmail account, the application began analyzing my email history to provide personalized AI assistance.\n\nShortwave main feature is AI email summarization. The AI assistant provided concise summaries of lengthy email threads, enabling me to grasp key points without reading through extensive conversations. I don't really handle that many emails in my job, but I can imagine it would be particularly beneficial for someone in a sales or outreach role where it would do a lot to reduce the cognitive load of reading and processing so many conversations.\n\nShortwave's language translation feature translated emails accurately, preserving the context and tone of the original message. The tool also has some handy functional that lets me convert emails into tasks, set reminders, and track progress without leaving the application.\n\nWhile I was impressed with Shortwave, the AI assistant occasionally misinterpreted the context of certain emails, leading to less accurate summaries or translations. Nevertheless, it's a comprehensive suite of features (AI summarization, translation, and task management) within a single platform.\n\nShortwave offers a free plan which includes basic email management features like AI assistance, 90 days of searchable email history, and inbox customization. Their personal plan costs $8.50 per seat/month.\n\nThe best AI presentation makers\n\nGa‎mma\n\nGamma is an AI-powered presentation tool that has made creating professional slides much easier.\n\nI gave it a try and I was impressed by how quickly it generated clean, visually appealing slides from simple prompts. What stood out immediately was the design quality. The AI handled the layout and formatting, allowing me to focus more on the content itself. I didn’t need to worry about alignment, colors, or fonts—Gamma took care of all of that.\n\nWhile the design of the slides looks great, I did find some limitations in the editing features. Gamma’s customization options, especially when it comes to modifying layouts and slide elements, felt somewhat restrictive. For example, while I could adjust text and add media, fine-tuning certain parts of the design (like moving text boxes or resizing elements) wasn’t as easy as I would have liked. I also noticed that the templates, though beautiful, are somewhat limiting if you want to move away from their general style or structure.\n\nDespite these limitations, it's a great choice for users who need to put together polished presentations without spending hours on design details.\n\nThe Free Plan offers 400 AI credits, basic image generation, and the ability to create up to 10 slides per presentation. The Plus Plan at $10/user/month includes unlimited AI creation, advanced image tools, more slides, and priority support.\n\nPr‎esentations.ai\n\nPresentations.ai is another AI-powered platform designed to simplify the creation of professional presentations.\n\nI would say that I found the visual appeal of the slides generated by this tool are pretty comparable with the slides generated by Gamma - there's not much in it.\n\nBoth tools also have real time collaboration features, enabling multiple users to work on the same presentation simultaneously.\n\nOne advantage that I found with Presentations.ai is that it aligned the generated presentation with my corporate brand and theme more closely than Gamma did. The slides that Gamma generated probably needed a bit more tinkering in this regard.\n\nPresentations.ai currently offers a Starter Plan for free (limited-time Early Bird pricing) with features like limited AI credits, team collaboration, basic functionality, and seamless sharing. For more advanced needs, the Pro Plan is available at $198 per user per year, providing additional AI credits, pro templates, custom fonts and colors, analytics, and PDF export.\n\nThe best AI resume builders\n\nTe‎al\n\nTeal is an AI-powered resume builder that helps me refine and optimize my resume. As someone who’s worked on my resume multiple times, I’ve always found it a bit tedious to get everything right, especially with the constant need to tailor it for specific job applications. So, I was curious to see how Teal could help speed up the process while ensuring my resume stood out.\n\nI added my job history, skills, and career goals and I was shown a live preview of the resume and Teal generated relevant bullet points based on my experience. For example, when I entered my previous role in marketing, the AI suggested action-oriented phrases like \"increased engagement by 30%\" or \"managed a team of 5,\" which gave my resume a polished, results-oriented feel right from the start. It saved me a lot of time and brainpower, as I didn’t have to come up with the right words or phrasing.\n\nTeal lets you import a job description, and it then tailors your resume by suggesting key skills and experience you might want to highlight. I tested this by uploading a marketing manager role I was interested in, and Teal highlighted key phrases from the job description and suggested how to incorporate them into my resume. It felt like a great way to ensure my resume was tailored for the position I was applying for without much extra work.\n\nTeal also provided real-time feedback on my resume. It gave suggestions like \"add more measurable achievements\" or \"use more action verbs,\" which I found really helpful. These suggestions made it clear where I could improve my resume, even if the content was technically correct. For example, I had some bullet points that didn’t really show the impact of my work, and Teal helped me reframe those to highlight results more effectively.\n\nThere are a couple of things that could be better. The AI, while quite helpful, wasn’t perfect. A few of the suggested phrases felt too generic and didn’t fully capture the nuances of my role. I had to tweak some of them to better reflect my personal contributions. Additionally, while there are a lot of customization options, I felt that some of the design templates were a bit too limited for my taste. I’d love to have more flexibility with fonts or section layouts to match my personal style.\n\nTeal offers a Free Plan that includes unlimited resumes and job tracking. The Teal+ Plan is available for $29 per month and gives you unlimited access to all the other features.\n\nKi‎ckresume\n\nKickresume is an AI-powered resume builder designed to assist users in creating professional and tailored resumes efficiently. The platform offers various templates and design options.\n\nKickresume's AI-driven content suggestions are super helpful. After I added the job title and job description/responsibilities, the AI proposed relevant bullet points and achievements. One of the most time-consuming aspects of applying for jobs is customizing your resume for the specific role, which typically involves highlighting a specific achievement or project that you have worked on. By analyzing the job description, Kickresume suggests relevant skills and experiences to include, enhancing the resume's alignment with the desired position. I found the AI suggestions were almost always helpful.\n\nKickresume also provides real-time feedback on the content and formatting of the resume. The platform highlights areas that may require improvement, such as keyword optimization and alignment with job descriptions.\n\nKickresume offers a Free Plan with basic resume and cover letter templates, a personal website template, and access to 20,000 pre-written phrases. For more features, the Monthly Plan at $19/month includes premium templates, unlimited customization, an AI resume checker, and priority support.\n\nThe best AI voice generators\n\nEl‎evenLabs\n\nElevenLabs is widely seen as the leading AI voice generator. It offers text-to-speech and voice cloning capabilities.\n\nThe voice quality is very high. I tested it by converting some text into speech, and the AI-generated voice sounded incredibly natural. It captured human intonation and rhythm much more effectively than I expected. I could also adjust parameters like pitch, speed, and tone, which gave me more control over how the voice would sound.\n\nI uploaded a sample of my own voice to the voice cloning feature, and it generated a model that closely resembled my speech patterns. I tested it by inputting my own text, and it sounded almost identical to my original recording. I did notice some slight differences in tone at times, but it was still incredibly accurate.\n\nI also tried integrating ElevenLabs with a text-to-speech application, which allowed me to seamlessly convert written content into spoken words. This is particularly useful for accessibility purposes or for anyone who prefers consuming content in audio format.\n\nWhile ElevenLabs does offer impressive features, there are a few areas for improvement. The AI-generated voices sometimes require minor adjustments for more precise tonal nuances. The customization options, though extensive, can feel a bit restrictive for more specific needs or highly specialized voices.\n\nI should also mention ElevenLabs AI Dubbing Studio, which really impressed me with its ability to create voiceovers and dub content in multiple languages. I uploaded a video and was able to quickly generate high-quality voiceover tracks in different voices and accents. It's a bit pricey, and there's no video dubbing/lip-sync capabilities (for that, check out Synthesia's AI video dubbing), but otherwise I thought it was a pretty neat extra set of features and it's definitely one of my favourite video translation apps.\n\nElevenLabs offers a free plan that gives you 10k credits (10 mins of text-to-speech). Their Starter Plan costs $5/month and gives you 30k credits (30 mins) along with voice cloning and Dubbing Studio access.\n\nMu‎rf\n\nI recently started using Murf AI for generating voiceovers for a few content creation projects. Specifically, I needed to produce voiceovers for explainer videos I was working on. The goal was to save time while still achieving high-quality, professional-sounding audio without having to record everything manually.\n\nI created an account and uploaded a script for my first video. I was able to choose from a wide selection of voices, including male and female options, in various accents and languages. The user interface is intuitive, and I found myself able to jump straight into the process without needing a tutorial.\n\nOne of the things I loved was how realistic the voices sounded. I tested several options and was impressed with how well the AI mimicked natural speech patterns. The intonation and rhythm were particularly good for a text-to-speech system. I used the voice that best matched the tone of the video, and it gave me a finished product that sounded professional and clear. It felt like a voiceover artist had recorded it, without the need for studio time (and $).\n\nMurf allows you to adjust parameters like pitch, speed, and tone. This was a huge help in fine-tuning the delivery of the lines. For example, I wanted a slightly more upbeat tone for the intro of the video, and Murf allowed me to make these adjustments easily.\n\nAnother feature I tried was the voice cloning tool, which allows you to create a replica of your own voice. I uploaded a short sample of my voice to test this, and the system generated a voice model that was surprisingly accurate. This feature could be useful for personalizing voiceovers, particularly if you want your own voice to appear in various content without having to record it each time.\n\nWhile I was generally impressed, I did encounter a couple of limitations. For instance, when I tested the AI-generated voice for more complex sentences, there were occasional mispronunciations or unnatural pauses. In these cases, I found it helpful to manually tweak the text or use Murf’s editing features to smooth things over. It would be ideal if the system could handle these nuances automatically, but it’s still a very solid tool overall.\n\nFor my particular project, Murf saved me a ton of time. Instead of recording my own voice for every line, I could focus more on the creative aspects of my video and use Murf to handle the bulk of the audio. I also found it useful when I needed to quickly create multiple versions of the same script—adjusting for different audiences or purposes without re-recording the entire voiceover.\n\nMurf offers a Free Plan with 10 minutes of voice generation and transcription, access to 120+ voices, and basic audio/video sharing. The Creator Plan at $29/month includes unlimited downloads, access to 200+ voices, 2 hours of voice generation per month, and commercial usage rights.\n\nThe best AI music generators\n\nSu‎no\n\nSuno is an AI-powered music generator that allows users to create songs by inputting text prompts. I entered a prompt describing the mood and genre I desired—a melancholic piano ballad—and Suno produced a complete song with vocals and instrumentation. The AI's ability to interpret and translate textual descriptions into musical compositions is pretty mind blowing.\n\nI found my generated song to be surprisingly coherent and emotive. The vocals, while synthetic, conveyed the intended melancholy, and the piano arrangement complemented the mood effectively. However, there were moments where the lyrics felt slightly repetitive, and the vocal delivery lacked some human nuances.\n\nSuno offers limited editing capabilities. I attempted to adjust the tempo and key, but the options were somewhat constrained. For more intricate modifications, external audio editing software would be necessary.\n\nDespite the editing limitations, I found the experience enjoyable and plan to use Suno again for generating quick musical ideas or exploring different genres. My most frequent use case for Suno is background music for social media posts and videos, and it's really great for that.\n\nAI-generated music is gaining traction, with platforms like Suno making it accessible to a broader audience. But while AI can produce impressive compositions, it currently lacks the depth and emotional complexity of human-created music. I think it will be a while yet until we're listening to AI-generated music for pleasure.\n\nSuno offers a Free Plan with 50 daily credits for up to 10 song generations per day, suitable for personal and non-commercial use. The Pro Plan at $10/month provides 2,500 credits per month, commercial use rights, priority generation, and the ability to run up to 10 tasks simultaneously.\n\nBe sure to get the Pro Plan if you want to use Suno like I do for social media posts and videos as you'll need the commercial license.\n\nUd‎io\n\nTo test Udio, I wanted to create an upbeat, electronic track with a strong bassline and catchy melodies, so I fed it a prompt describing the vibe I was aiming for.\n\nThe track had a solid structure, with a clear intro, build-up, and drop. The synths were vibrant and energetic, and the rhythm section had a groove that made the track feel engaging.\n\nOne thing that sets Udio apart from Suno is its approach to genre-specific customization. Udio offers a more direct way of shaping the style of the music based on the prompt you give it. For example, I could request specific instruments or even ask for a particular type of electronic subgenre. While the song was definitely listenable and had the vibe I wanted, it wasn’t without limitations. The vocals, while fitting, still felt a bit robotic.\n\nEditing options in Udio are also a bit more flexible than Suno, but still not at the level of traditional music production software.\n\nUdio offers a Free Plan with 100 credits per month for up to 50 song generations and basic music creation tools. For more credits you'll need the Standard Plan which costs $10/month.\n\nComparison Table",
      "# [AI is Not the Writer’s Enemy by Harley Austin, medium.harleyaustin.com on 2024-02-24](https://medium.harleyaustin.com/ai-is-not-the-writers-enemy-45b03145737b)\nAI is Not Really the Enemy—Scammers Are\n\nLast year I wrote an article about an AI tool that really impressed me with its ability to proofread my chapters. Note that I did not say it “wrote” my chapters. Most of us as real authors despise those kinds of tools.\n\nUnfortunately, these “write it for you” tools are popping up everywhere now. Not a day goes by that I don’t see some social media ad for a new AI tool that promises to make me a bestselling author by writing my book FOR me.\n\nAmazon is now flooded with millions of junk books written by AI and published by people who cannot write, but who bought into some scammer’s $37 “system” for getting rich on Amazon by using AI to write a worthless book no one would want to actually buy.\n\nNeedless to say, AI has left a really bad taste in the mouths of real authors and writers who spend years of our lives honing our craft, only to be overshadowed in the marketplace by people who cannot write their way out of a wet paper bag.\n\nBut this is the new world we live in as AI emerges front and center into our strange and ever-changing new world.\n\nThe AI Tools Worth Writing About\n\nThat being said, AI is not really our enemy; scammers promising quick riches to gullible people are, but that’s an article for another time.\n\nThe AI proofreading tool I wrote about last year worked well, but it was rather rudimentary in how it worked. Mostly it was because I couldn’t actually see the changes the tool made to my text it had corrected. Also, there was no way to preserve formatting, curly quotes, etc. It was a very basic tool.\n\nFast-forward a few months and I have discovered a bevy of new AI writing tools thanks to social media. I am going to briefly review a few of them here, but mostly I’m going to focus on the one that is really the easiest of the four to use.\n\nWhat’s the cost?\n\nMost of these tools all cost about the same, about $10 to $20 per month, and all of them charge you in some fashion by the number of words you process. There are some that don’t charge by usage, but they are much more pricey per month to use—or the tool itself is a scam.\n\nScammers sell you a one-time or “lifetime” subscription for $59 to $149 or whatever, which is an unsustainable business model for any usage-based business. At some point, when the expenses exceed their Ponzi-scheme revenues, the company and your money will disappear forever.\n\nIf you see a writing tool promising a “lifetime” or one-time purchase option, run. It’s a scam.\n\nAll these tools are using one or more versions of OpenAI’s ChatGPT AI engine under the hood. What makes them better than just trying to use your own OpenAI account directly are their writing and editing features that OpenAI doesn’t offer.\n\nAlso, one of the benefits of using OpenAI under the hood is that they don’t use (ie. plagiarize) our work to train their models. As of March of 2023, OpenAI announced that they will NOT be training their models using user-entered content. This is GREAT news for us as authors and writers!\n\nSo let’s take a look at these tools, in reverse order of my pet personal preference. You can then decide which of these might work best for you.\n\n3. AutoCrit\n\nWhile AutoCrit has been around for a few years, I’ve only been seeing their ads since last year. Like Sudowrite, AutoCrit’s “creative studio” feature can do a deep-dive into helping you prompt the AI with all kinds of terms as it literally rewrites your chapters for you.\n\nBut AutoCrit is much more than just AI. It’s an entire writing platform.\n\nWhat turned me off about AutoCrit was that it attempts to take over my entire writing process with its own “process”. Huh? Look, I just want to write my book, not insert myself into some massive framework that leads me by the nose into taking over every step of my writing and publishing. Does it blow my nose too?\n\nAutoCrit is a “plotter’s” dream come true, and a “pantser’s” worst nightmare.\n\nWhile AutoCrit is a well-polished product, it does WAY too much. And all that hand-holding comes with a price tag. AutoCrit is by far the most expensive of all these tools. But if you need this level of hand-holding, encouragement, feedback, and nose-wiping to write a novel, then maybe this tool is for you. I’m much too type-A, much too free-spirited, to be using a nit-picky style-rating tool like this. Get out of my way, I just want to write.\n\n1. PowerWord AI\n\nThe tool I liked the best was PowerWord. Written by authors for authors, PowerWord is by far the more easy-to-use and polished of these tools and the one that least got in my way during proofreading and editing.\n\nWhat I liked best was how PowerWord shows you your original text in one window while letting you compare what the AI changed in a companion window. You can then scroll through the linked windows and see the changes that the AI made, then edit the results. Boom! Done.\n\nI also liked how PowerWord let me select between light and dark screen modes, and between serif and san-serif font faces in the edit windows. Those are subtle but nice touches.\n\nWhile all of these tools basically charge by the number of words you process, because that’s how OpenAI bills for their service, PowerWord was by far the least expensive to get started. You can start with as little as $5 to buy words on a pay-as-you-go basis, or you can sign up for a subscription starting at just $5 per month for double the number of words. PowerWord also doesn’t scam you into a lower monthly rate by making you pay annually either. That was refreshing to see.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was that PowerWord seemed to understand how I want to work. You can tell these people are actual authors themselves because the tool gets out of your way and just lets you work like a real writer would. For me, I just want to paste my chapter into the tool, click proofread, see what got changed, then copy the corrected text back into Word and move on. That’s exactly how PowerWord lets me work. It gets the job done quickly and efficiently without a bunch of bells and whistles and other editor noise getting in the way.\n\nMost impressively, PowerWord didn’t change my text formatting. Curly quotes, italics, bold, all of it was still there. PowerWord was also able to correct emphasis on words that needed emphasis where before I hadn’t used it. Wow.\n\nLike the other tools, PowerWord lets me proofread, analyze, summarize, and even rewrite paragraphs using different genres, if I need. It would be a great tool for editors too. In fact, anyone who writes would benefit from using this tool.\n\nAnother thing PowerWord did was get out of my way so that I could just use ChatGPT conversationally. No need to pull up another window. Just click the Chat link and I was off and running asking for some info on the topic I was writing about.\n\nPowerWord was also the only tool I saw that offered translating. You can translate an entire novel into multiple languages. And the translation is quite good. Of course, it’s not going to be as good as a native writer in whatever language, but several of my Spanish-speaking friends were impressed with how well the tool translated English to Spanish. It does a good job of translating dialects too. When translating American English into British, I noticed native idioms I’ve never even seen before.\n\nThe Limitations of AI\n\nNow for the caveats—if you’re a romance author, expect to see these tools tone-down your steamy love scenes. Most of the AI engines out there eschew NSFW (not safe for work) prose. If you’re editing a steamy-hot love scene using any of these tools, you will need to do a bit more manual editing, as the AI returns a kind of Biblical purple prose you probably won’t appreciate, or it lets you know you just violated its terms of service.\n\nAnother gotcha was the AI “temperature” or what PowerWord calls the “creative” level you want the AI to use. I got the best results when keeping the creative temperature on its next to lowest settings. Otherwise you get prose that reads like the AI is on LSD.\n\nFinally, just keep in mind that while these tools are really good, they are not perfect. You still need to manually edit some of what the AI generates. The AI often got wordy on rewrites, attempting to create new parts of the story I didn’t need it adding.\n\nNone of them were perfect, but they will save you time, a lot of time, editing and proofreading with a high level of accuracy you just won't get trying to do it yourself.",

While both offer features for fiction authors, there are notable differences between the two. In this article, we will compare and evaluate the two tools in terms of ease of use, tailored authorship, community, story bible handling, in-text editing, full chapter generation, customization, and pricing. By examining each category, we will determine which tool is better suited for authors in their pursuit of using AI to write fiction.\n\nEase of Use\n\nPSE sudoite: When it comes to ease of use, PSE sudoite provides a relatively straightforward user interface. The instructions are clear, and after familiarizing oneself with the tool, it becomes easy to navigate. From brainstorming to creating a story bible, PSE sudoite simplifies the process and allows authors to easily input their ideas. However, some features, such as the brainstorming section, may not be as useful for authors seeking more advanced prompts.\n\nNovel Crafter: Novel Crafter offers a more robust user interface with a wider range of options and features. While this may initially appear overwhelming, it provides greater customization and flexibility for authors. The \"Chat\" feature, in particular, stands out as a valuable tool for bouncing ideas back and forth with the AI. Novel Crafter understands the specific needs of authors, and its interface is tailored to meet those needs. The inclusion of a Codex section for character development and the ability to export different elements of the project also contribute to its usability.\n\nOverall, both PSE sudoite and Novel Crafter have their strengths in terms of ease of use. While PSE sudoite may be simpler for beginners, Novel Crafter offers more advanced features and a better understanding of author requirements.\n\nTailored for Authors\n\nPSE sudoite: PSE sudoite labels itself as a tool created by authors for authors. However, it becomes evident that the developers may not have the same level of investment in the author community as expected. The brainstorming feature, for example, lacks the back-and-forth interaction that is crucial for effective brainstorming. Additionally, the limited space for characters in the story bible may be a hindrance.\n\nNovel Crafter: In contrast, Novel Crafter demonstrates a deep understanding of the author community. Its features are designed to meet the specific needs of authors, such as the inclusion of the Codex section for characters, locations, and objects. The ability to add notes and tailored prompts further showcases its commitment to providing a tool that is truly tailor-made for authors.\n\nIn terms of catering to authors, Novel Crafter outshines PSE sudoite by offering a more comprehensive and well-thought-out approach.\n\nCommunity\n\nPSE sudoite: PSE sudoite has a supportive and active community that is accessible through its Discord server. Users can seek tips, ask questions, and find new ways to utilize the tool. While the community is helpful, it should be noted that the founders may not have the same degree of passion for authorship as expected.\n\nNovel Crafter: Novel Crafter also boasts an active and wholesome community accessible through its Discord server. The community includes developers, ambassadors, and fellow users who are all willing to provide assistance and guidance. The community support extends beyond Novel Crafter itself, as they actively engage in discussions related to other AI writing tools as well.\n\nBoth PSE sudoite and Novel Crafter have thriving communities, making it a tie in this category.\n\nStory Bible\n\nPSE sudoite: PSE sudoite offers a story bible section where authors can input background information about their novels, including characters. However, it should be noted that the story bible in PSE sudoite is limited to characters and lacks the ability to include other crucial elements such as locations, objects, or lore. This limitation may restrict the overall usefulness of the story bible tool.\n\nNovel Crafter: Novel Crafter provides the Codex section, which encompasses not only characters but also locations, objects, lore, and more. This comprehensive approach allows authors to input all the necessary information for their world-building process. Additionally, the ability to add notes and tags further enhances the usability of the Codex.\n\nIn terms of story bible handling, Novel Crafter surpasses PSE sudoite by providing a more expansive and feature-rich tool.\n\nIn-Text Editing\n\nPSE sudoite: Both PSE sudoite and Novel Crafter offer the ability to edit text within the platform. PSE sudoite provides options such as rewriting, describing, and expanding the selected text. While these options may be useful for brainstorming purposes, they may not offer significant benefits for actual fiction writing.\n\nNovel Crafter: Novel Crafter allows users to expand, rephrase, and edit text through various models. The platform provides more flexibility and customization options, ensuring that authors can fine-tune their writing to their satisfaction.\n\nBoth platforms offer similar functionality in terms of in-text editing. However, Novel Crafter's additional options and customization capabilities make it a slightly better choice for authors seeking more control over their writing.\n\nFull Chapter Generation\n\nPSE sudoite: PSE sudoite allows users to generate full chapters at once by inputting scene beats. While this feature may seem convenient, it often leads to the AI veering off track and requires significant editing to ensure coherence and consistency throughout the chapter.\n\nNovel Crafter: Novel Crafter takes a different approach to chapter generation. By breaking down the chapter into scene beats and generating them individually, the platform provides better readability and allows authors to edit and refine their writing along the way. This method ensures that the AI remains consistent and aligned with the author's style and intent.\n\nAlthough full chapter generation is possible in both platforms, Novel Crafter's approach offers more control and better overall results.\n\nCustomization\n\nPSE sudoite: PSE sudoite offers the option to customize prompts through plugins. Users can create their own prompts or use prompts created by others. While this feature enhances customization, it falls short in terms of modifying the existing prompts provided by PSE sudoite.\n\nNovel Crafter: Novel Crafter excels in customization, allowing users to modify prompts, adjust various settings, and access a wide range of models through OpenAI's API integration. The platform offers unparalleled flexibility, empowering authors to tailor their AI writing experience according to their specific needs.\n\nWhen it comes to customization, Novel Crafter outperforms PSE sudoite by providing more options and greater control over the writing process.\n\nPricing\n\nPSE sudoite: Pricing for PSE sudoite is based on a credit system, with different tiers offering varying amounts of credits per month. The cost increases with the number of credits available, with the highest tier providing the most credits. However, the exact cost of using PSE sudoite is not explicitly disclosed, making it difficult to assess the true value for money.\n\nNovel Crafter: Novel Crafter offers straightforward pricing based on subscription tiers. The starting tier is available for as low as $4 per month, with additional tiers priced at $8, $14, and $20 per month. The cost primarily covers the platform and server maintenance, with AI generation costs separate and based on external providers such as OpenAI. This transparent pricing model allows authors to accurately gauge their expenditure and make informed decisions.\n\nIn terms of pricing, Novel Crafter provides a more transparent and affordable option for authors, making it the preferred choice.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter evaluating each category, it is clear that Novel Crafter outperforms PSE sudoite in most aspects. Its user-friendly interface, tailored features for authors, comprehensive story bible tool, customizable prompts, and transparent pricing model make it the superior AI writing tool for fiction authors. While PSE sudoite offers simplicity and a supportive community, Novel Crafter's advanced capabilities and affordability outweigh these advantages. However, it is important to note that as the field of AI writing tools continues to evolve, future updates and developments may shift the balance. Nonetheless, as of now, Novel Crafter stands as the recommended choice for authors seeking an AI-powered writing tool.\n\nHighlights\n\nNovel Crafter offers a more advanced and tailored interface for authors.\n\nNovel Crafter's Codex provides a comprehensive and customizable story bible tool.\n\nBoth platforms have active and supportive communities.\n\nNovel Crafter allows for greater customization and flexibility in Prompt creation.\n\nNovel Crafter's transparent pricing model offers more affordable options for authors.\n\nFAQ\n\nQ: Can I use Novel Crafter for non-fiction writing?

      "# [The 6 best AI writing generators in 2024 by Harry Guinness on 2023-04-06](https://zapier.com/blog/best-ai-writing-generator/)\nSince ChatGPT burst onto the scene a couple years back, AI-powered writing tools have been cropping up everywhere. Microsoft, Google, Apple, and near enough every other tech company is adding them to their products. Many dedicated AI writing apps have gone from the cutting edge to irrelevant in the space of a year. Having AI generate text isn't a groundbreaking product anymore—it's a feature of countless apps.\n\nWith that said, the best AI text generators can still help you work better and faster, and create more polished and on-brand copy. The bar has just shifted much, much higher. If Microsoft Word and Google Docs can generate decent text, then dedicated apps need to bring a whole lot more to the table. These six apps do.\n\nI've been covering this kind of generative AI technology for almost a decade. Since AI is supposedly trying to take my job, I'm somewhat professionally interested in the whole situation. Still, I think I'm pretty safe for now. These AI writing tools are incredibly impressive, but you have to work with them, rather than just letting them spit out whatever they want. Left to their own devices, they tend to produce fairly generic and frequently incorrect content, even if it can pass for something a human wrote.\n\nSo, if you're looking for an AI content generator that will help you write compelling copy, publish blog posts a lot quicker, and otherwise take some of the slow-paced typing out of writing, you've come to the right place. Let's dig in.\n\nThe best AI writing software\n\nJasper for businesses\n\nAnyword for advertising and social media\n\nWriter for AI compliance\n\nWritesonic for content marketing\n\nRytr for an affordable AI writer\n\nSudowrite for fiction\n\nHow do AI writing tools work?\n\nSearch Google for AI writing software, and you'll find dozens of different dedicated options, all with suspiciously similar features. There's a big reason for this: 95% of these AI writing tools use the same large language models (LLMs) as the back end. Most are just wrappers for the OpenAI and Claude API with a few extra features built on top—though they really try to hide this in their marketing material.\n\nWith a bit of steering, you can get very similar results from ChatGPT and Gemini, which use the same LLMs to work as chatbots. If you wanted to, you could even create your own version of an AI writing assistant without code using Zapier's OpenAI integrations.\n\nThis is why apps from Microsoft Word and Google Docs to Notion and Coda have been so quick to add their own AI text generation features. They aren't having to create a new LLM from scratch—just to partner with one of the major players. (Or in Google's case, use the LLM its lab has been developing for years.)\n\nSee how one writer created an AI writing coach with GPT and other ways you can use OpenAI with Zapier.\n\nAs for the underlying LLM models themselves, they work by taking a prompt from you, and then predicting what words will best follow on from your request, based on the data they were trained on. That training data includes books, articles, and other documents across all different topics, styles, and genres—and an unbelievable amount of content scraped from the open internet. Basically, LLMs were allowed to crunch through the sum total of human knowledge to form a deep learning neural network—a complex, many-layered, weighted algorithm modeled after the human brain. Yes, that's the kind of thing you have to do to create a computer program that generates bad poems.\n\nIf you want to dive more into the specifics, check out the Zapier articles on natural language processing and how ChatGPT works. But suffice it to say: GPT and other large language models are incredibly powerful already—and because of that, these AI writing tools have a lot of potential.\n\nWhat makes the best AI text generator?\n\nHow we evaluate and test apps\n\nOur best apps roundups are written by humans who've spent much of their careers using, testing, and writing about software. Unless explicitly stated, we spend dozens of hours researching and testing apps, using each app as it's intended to be used and evaluating it against the criteria we set for the category. We're never paid for placement in our articles from any app or for links to any site—we value the trust readers put in us to offer authentic evaluations of the categories and apps we review. For more details on our process, read the full rundown of how we select apps to feature on the Zapier blog.\n\nWe know that most AI text generators rely on the same handful of large language models, so no apps are going to stand out because of some dramatic difference in the quality of their output. Creating effective, human-like text is now table stakes.\n\nAs I was testing these apps, here's what I was looking for:\n\nTools that were specifically designed for generating great AI-generated text. Dozens of apps can generate text, but dedicated AI text generators make the whole workflow a lot more seamless and repeatable. Unless generating text was a major selling point of a particular app (and it had the features to back it up), you won't find it on this list.\n\nAn interface that gives you a lot of control over the text output. The more options you have to influence the tone, style, language, content, and everything else, the better. I didn't want tools where you just entered a headline and let the AI do the rest; these are all tools that you collaborate with so you can write great copy quickly. The best AI writing tools also let you set a default brand voice that's always on and create a knowledge base that it can use as a source of truth.\n\nEase of use. You shouldn't have to fight to get the AI to do what you want. With AI writing software like this, there will always be some redoing and reshaping to get the exact output you want, but working with the AI shouldn't feel like wrangling a loose horse. Similarly, great help docs and good onboarding were both a major plus.\n\nAffordability. ChatGPT is currently free, and all these tools are built on top of APIs that cost pennies. There was no hard and fast price limit, but the more expensive tools had to justify the extra expense with better features and a nicer app. After all, almost every app will produce pretty similar outputs regardless of what it costs.\n\nApps that weren't designed to make spam content. Previous text-generating tools could \"spin\" content by changing words to synonyms so that unscrupulous website owners could rip off copyrighted material and generally create lots of low-quality, low-value content. None of that on this list.\n\nEven with these criteria, I had more than 50 different AI writing tools to test. Remember: it's relatively easy for a skilled developer to build a wrapper around the GPT API, so I had to dig deep into each one to find out if it was any good or just had a flashy marketing site.\n\nI tested each app by getting it to write a number of different short- and long-form bits of copy, but as expected, there were very few meaningful quality differences. Instead, it was the overall user experience, depth of features, and affordability that determined whether an app made this list.\n\nThe best AI writing generators at a glance\n\nBest AI writing generator for businesses\n\nJasper (Web)\n\nJasper pros:\n\nOne of the most mature and feature-filled options on the list\n\nIntegrates with Grammarly, Surfer, and its own AI art generator\n\nJasper cons:\n\nExpensive given that all the apps use similar language models\n\nJasper (formerly Jarvis) is one of the most feature-filled and powerful AI content generators. It was among the first wave of apps built on top of GPT, and its relative longevity means that it feels like a more mature tool than most of the other apps I tested. It's continued to grow and develop in the months since I first compiled this list.\n\nIf you have a business and budget isn't your primary concern, Jasper should be one of the first apps you try. It's pivoted to mostly focus on marketing campaigns rather than just generating generic AI content. That's not a bad thing, but it means that plans now start at $49/month for individual creators and $69/month for features like a knowledge base and AI image generation.\n\nJasper claims to intelligently combine \"several large language models\" so that \"you get the highest quality outputs and superior uptime.\" While I can't say that I noticed a massive difference between Jasper's output and any other app's, it does give you a few solid controls so that your content matches your brand.\n\nFor example, you can create a brand Voice by uploading some appropriate sample text. Based on a few examples of my writing, Jasper created a style that is \"knowledgeable, straightforward, and slightly irreverent, with a clear focus on providing in-depth, accurate information. It's authoritative yet approachable, using humor and a conversational style to make complex topics more digestible.\" I don't think that's a bad summary of the content I fed in, and its output for a few test blog posts was significantly closer to my writing than when I asked it to use a generic casual tone of voice. It still used a few words I wouldn't, but it was close enough.\n\nSimilarly, there's a Knowledge Base where you can add facts about your business and products so Jasper gets important details right. When combined, these two features make creating good AI-generated content significantly easier. For a large organization that's concerned with consistent messaging across multiple departments and platforms, I suspect Jasper can be really handy.\n\nOtherwise, Jasper rounds things out with some nice integrations. It has a built-in ChatGPT competitor and AI art generator (though, again, lots of other apps have both), plays nice with the SEO app Surfer, and there's a browser extension to bring Jasper everywhere.\n\nYou can also connect Jasper to thousands of other apps using Zapier and kick off Jasper's AI generation from wherever you spend your time. Learn more about how to automate Jasper, or try one of these pre-built workflows.\n\nJasper pricing: Creator plan from $49/month with one brand voice. Pro plan starts at $69/month for three brand voices and 10 knowledge assets.\n\nBest AI writing assistant for advertising and social media\n\nAnyword (Web)\n\nAnyword pros:\n\nMakes it very easy to generate content for social media and ads\n\nEngagement scores and other metrics are surprisingly accurate; plus, it integrates with various ad platforms\n\nAnyword cons:\n\nPretty expensive for a more limited set of features than some of the other apps on this list\n\nIf you're as concerned with click-throughs, conversion rates, and CPM as you are with generating AI text, then Anyword is the app for you. It's designed with performance marketers in mind.\n\nAnyword has two main content creation tools: The Blog Wizard for longer-form content marketing and the Data-Driven Editor for ads, social media captions, marketing emails, and the like. Both allow you to set what talking points you want to hit, indicate the features you want to highlight, use your brand voice and vocabulary, and target your content toward specific audiences.\n\nThe Data-Driven Editor, in particular, is targeted at social media and ads. In addition to allowing you to create content with specific platforms in mind, Anyword analyzes everything it generates (or you create) and gives it an engagement score that compares how it stacks up to the content it has in its database. While I certainly can't confirm the validity of any of these scores, they at least pass the sniff test. I generally thought the AI-generated content that Anyword scored higher was better—and even when I disagreed, I still liked one of the top options.\n\nWith all this focus on marketing, it should probably be no surprise that Anyword integrates directly with Google Ads, Meta ads, HubSpot, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, and all your social media accounts—including LinkedIn. Depending on the channel, it can use historical data or posts to help create new content.\n\nWhile Anyword isn't as broadly useful as Jasper, if you're more focused on advertising and social content than anything else, it's well worth a look.\n\nAnyword pricing: Starter plan from $49/month for 1 user and 1 brand voice.\n\nBest AI text generator for AI compliance\n\nWriter (Web)\n\nWriter pros:\n\nFree of a lot of the controversy surrounding LLMs\n\nSurprisingly capable as an editor, making sure your team sticks to the style guide and doesn't make any wild claims\n\nWriter cons:\n\nRequires a lot more setup to get the most from\n\nMost LLMs come with quite a lot of baggage. OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and others have been less than transparent about exactly what data was used to create their AI models. Nearly every AI company is facing some kind of lawsuit over the use of copyrighted material in its training dataset. No one is really denying that protected materials—potentially from pirated databases—were used to train these models; the question is just whether or not it falls under fair use.\n\nFor most people, this is a nebulous situation filled with edge cases and gray areas. Realistically, it's going to be years before it's all sorted out, and even then, things will have moved on so far that the results of any lawsuit are likely to be redundant. But for businesses that want to use AI writing tools without controversy attached, many AI tools are a no-go—and will be for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhich is where Writer comes in.\n\nOn the face of things, Writer is much the same as any of my top picks. It can generate on-brand content suitable for any purpose—though if you want more than five users, more control over your brand voice, or the ability to use a knowledge base, you need to sign up for a custom Enterprise plan. (The publicly available Team plan feels almost like a demo.)\n\nBut where Writer stands out is its attention to corporate compliance, both from a policy and legal perspective. It can work like a company-specific Grammarly-like editor, keeping on top of legal compliance, ensuring you don't make any unsupported claims, and checking that everything matches your style guide—even when humans are writing the text. There are also specific versions of its Palmyra LLM tailored for medical and financial content.\n\nIn side-by-side comparisons, Writer's text generations sometimes felt a little weaker than the ones from Jasper or Anyword. Palmyra is definitely a little hamstrung by Writer's attempts to keep everything above board, rather than just using every available bit of available training data, regardless of copyright. Still, it's not really meant to be used right out of the box. It's designed for large enterprises that can configure detailed compliance preferences, add all their own training data, and generally set things up so that they have a writing tool that works exactly as they need it to.\n\nWriter also integrates with Zapier, so you can use Writer to create content directly from whatever apps you use most. Learn more about how to automate Writer, or take a look at these pre-made workflows.\n\nWriter pricing: Team from $18/user/month for up to 5 users; after that, it's an Enterprise plan.\n\nBest AI text generator for content marketing\n\nWritesonic (Web)\n\nWritesonic pros:\n\nBuilt-in SEO tools make tailoring your content marketing to search engines easy\n\nA lot of control over AI quality\n\nWritesonic cons:\n\nCheaper plan isn't very good\n\nOf all the apps on this list, Writesonic gives the highest priority to generating search-optimized content. Its AI Article Writer tool combines keyword analysis, competitor research, and reference finding into the whole article creation process. You can also use its SEO tools independently. While none of this is a replacement for full-featured SEO tools, it's still handy to have.\n\nUnfortunately, Writesonic makes things a bit more complicated than some other apps price-wise. Writesonic has three versions of its AI Article Writer available: AI Article Writer 4.0 which seems to use GPT-3.5, AI Article Writer 5.0 which uses GPT-4, and AI Article Writer 6.0, which uses the latest models (and is also available in three quality versions). They also have different levels of automatic web research, and slightly different search research tools. AI Article Writer 5.0 and AI Article Writer 6.0 cost between 5 and 100 AI credits, depending on what quality you want.\n\nTo be honest, AI Article Writer 4.0 is fairly useless at this point. The drop-off in quality from the latest versions is huge. As a result, the $20/month individual plan that includes unlimited generations with it plus 50 credits to use towards the more powerful models is hard to recommend. That's only 10 uses of AI Article Writer 5.0, and two or three of 6.0.\n\nAll this complexity is doubly strange because Writesonic used to have the most transparent model selection process going. It first made this list because it was the only app that allowed you to directly select what LLM it used. I'm optimistic that I'm testing it at a transitional time, and that things will be a lot more streamlined the next time I review it—or when you go to sign up.\n\nOtherwise, it's another competent AI writing tool. You can create brand voices, work in its Google Docs-style editor, and even integrate it with Zapier, so you can send new copy to any of the other apps you use in your writing workflow. Learn more about how to automate Writesonic, or get started with one of these examples.\n\nWritesonic pricing: Individual plan from $20/month with 50 credits; Standard from $99/month with 1,000 credits and additional features\n\nRead more: Writesonic vs. Jasper\n\nBest free AI writing generator (with affordable upgrades)\n\nRytr (Web)\n\nRytr pros:\n\nA solid free plan and a cheap unlimited plan\n\nRytr cons:\n\nThe app is more basic than more expensive offerings\n\nMost of the apps on this list are aimed at professionals, businesses, and anyone else with a budget. Jasper and Anyword start at $49/month; Writer is $18/month but very quickly jumps to custom pricing. These aren't exactly hobbyist-friendly sums of money, so if you want to explore AI text generators without spending as much, give Rytr a go.\n\nThere's a basic free plan that's good for 10,000 characters (around 2,500 words) per month. The Unlimited plan starts at $9/month and adds features like a custom tone. There's also a Premium plan for $29/month that supports multiple tones and allows you to configure custom use cases, but at that point, I'd probably recommend making the leap to an intro plan with Jasper or Anyword.\n\nFeature-wise, there are some trade-offs. Rytr feels pretty barebones and seems to rely on the cheaper or older LLMs. When I asked it what model it was using, it told me GPT-3. While still good, that's far from state-of-the-art if true. And because you don't have as much control over the brand voice or knowledge it relies on, there's definitely the potential to create less effective content with Rytr than with some of the other options. Still, at just $9/month, I couldn't cut it from the list.\n\nRytr pricing: Free plan for 10,000 characters/month and lots of other features; Unlimited plan from $9/month.\n\nBest AI writing tool for writing fiction\n\nSudowrite (Web)\n\nSudowrite pros:\n\nThe only AI tool on the list explicitly aimed at writing fiction\n\nSuper fun to use if you've ever wanted to play around with fiction\n\nSudowrite cons:\n\nIt's still an AI text generator, so it can produce nonsensical metaphors, clichéd plots, and incoherent action\n\nVery controversial in fiction writing circles\n\nWhen I saw Sudowrite's marketing copy, I didn't think for a second it would make it onto this list. Then I tried it and…I kind of love it. Sudowrite is a totally different tool than all the others on this list because it's aimed at fiction writers. And with that, comes a lot of controversy. Sudowrite has been called \"an insult to writers everywhere\" and has been generally dismissed as a tool for hacks by a lot of Very Online writers. And while it's true that it's nowhere close to replacing a human author, it's fun, functional, and can genuinely help with writing a work of fiction.\n\nWhile you can use Sudowrite to generate an outline, create all your characters, and basically write the whole story by itself, the results are likely to be very weird. Instead, its assistive tools are what make it more likable and useful.\n\nLet's start with Describe. Select a word or phrase, click Describe, and the AI will generate a few suggestions for the sight, smell, taste, sound, and touch of the thing, as well as a couple of metaphors. If you're the kind of writer who struggles to add sensory depth to your short stories, it can help you get into the habit of describing things in more interesting ways.\n\nThen there's Brainstorm. It allows you to use the AI to generate possible dialogue options, character names and traits, plot points, places, and other details about your world from your descriptions and cues. If you know you want a big hairy warrior with a huge sword but can't think of a good name, it can suggest a few, like Thorgrim and Bohart.\n\nThere's also an extensive collection of user-created plugins, that can give you feedback or up the...intensity of romantic scenes.\n\nAnd these are just scratching the surface. Sure, if you over-rely on the AI to solve all your problems, you'll probably end up with an impressively generic story. But if you use it as a writing buddy to bounce ideas off and get you out of a rut, it's got serious potential.\n\nBest of all, Sudowrite is super easy to use. The onboarding, tool tips, and general helpful vibe of the app are something other developers could learn from.\n\nSudowrite pricing: Hobby & Student plan from $19/month for 225,000 AI credits/month.\n\nOther AI writing tools to consider\n\nAI writing tools are increasingly a feature rather than a dedicated app. Some good AI writing generators didn't make the list, either because text generation wasn't the focus of the app or they didn't meet my criteria in some other way. Here are a few you might consider:\n\nEvery chatbot. ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are surprisingly competent and fun to use. And best of all, you can use them for free.\n\nEvery document suite. Both Microsoft Office and Google Workspace are adding lots of AI tools, though most are aimed at enterprises. If you use them, give the AI features a look.\n\nWordtune and Grammarly are both great tools for editing and improving your own writing.\n\nLots of notes apps have AI features. For example, Notion AI and Coda AI both add a powerful AI tool directly into their respective apps.\n\nSurfer and Frase are both AI-powered SEO tools. They fell slightly out of scope for this list, but they can both help you optimize and improve your content—AI-generated or not.\n\nEmail apps, texting apps, and countless others. Honestly, AI text generators are going to be everywhere soon.\n\nAll of the apps on this list offer at the very least a free trial, so I'd suggest trying some of them out for a few minutes until you find the one that seems to work best with your workflow.\n\nRelated reading:\n\nHow to use OpenAI's GPT to spark content ideas\n\n8 ways real businesses are using AI for content creation\n\nHow to detect AI-generated content\n\nThe best AI marketing tools\n\nThe best AI voice generators\n\nThe best free AI tools",
      "# [Comparing 5 top editing tools for authors by JD Lasica on 2024-03-29](https://authors.ai/comparing-5-top-editing-tools-for-authors/)\nEvery author knows we need a lot of tools in our arsenal to write the best books possible and reach as many folks as we can. And no two authors are alike.\n\nSo let’s focus on the writing bit today, because there are just a handful of tools that come to mind when it comes to tools that increase our writing proficiency — and that ultimately help us sell more books.\n\nWhen people come to authors.ai, they want to know how Marlowe — our fiction-trained AI and virtual editor — stacks up against the competition. Which of the other tools are complementary or overlap with what Marlowe delivers. Let’s dive in!\n\nA chart for easy comparisons\n\nToday we’re unveiling a table that gives you a quick, at-a-glance comparison of the major author tools. See our Author tools comparison page.\n\nNow, we could do a review of each of these services, but as a tool provider ourselves, it makes more sense to point out the features we have and what other tools you might want to add to your toolkit.\n\nMisspellings\n\nAs a thriller author, I usually don’t worry too much about misspellings until I’m done with my first draft. Fixing misspellings comes in at the rewrite stage. Depending on what software you use to write, you may use a spellcheck checker in Microsoft Word or a Grammarly plug-in to do this. Marlowe provides a separate section on possible misspellings so you don’t have to scroll through an 80,000-word manuscript to see which words are flagged.\n\nWriting tips\n\nThis is a bit of a grab bag. What constitutes good writing? Partly it’s storytelling but partly it’s knowing how to make your writing stand out with memorable characters, vivid settings and writing that eschews the passive voice in favor of strong, active verbs, no-nonsense nouns, few adjectives and fewer adverbs. Marlowe flags overused words and phrases and gives you a count of how many times you use a certain adjective or adverb — as we’re all wont to do.\n\nStory beats\n\nStory beats, or narrative beats, is an area where Marlowe outshines all the others. Veteran authors know the importance of spacing out story beats within a scene. But it’s even more important to make sure you place story beats — both positive and negative — at regular intervals throughout your story. About every 10 percent seems to be a good marker. Bestselling authors tell us they use Marlowe on first draft of their novel, then go back and rearrange some of the scenes or chapters to make sure major action scenes aren’t too close to each other and there no long sections where nothing significant is happening.\n\nPacing\n\nPacing is one of the toughest things to be aware of when you’re writing your novel. I’ve used Pro Writing Aid and AutoCrit but haven’t seen their pacing guidance. Marlowe provides a graphic that lets you see the overall pacing of your novel, which charts the hills and valleys of the narrative.\n\nStory archetype\n\nFew authors I know begin their story with an archetype or narrative arc in mind. I don’t know of any other author tools that offer, but I’ve found Marlowe’s archetype analysis useful whenever I approach the end of the first draft of a new work. (To understand archetypes better, see my article, Examples of narrative arcs in modern fiction.) At that point, you can say, Oh! I’ve written a Man in a Hole story, or a Quest or Rags to Riches tale. And then you can see how your story’s narrative shapes up against others that have followed the same story shape. You may want to make some adjustments accordingly to follow the general contours of one of these classic storytelling patterns that authors have been using for generations.\n\nPlot turns\n\nYou know what makes a great page-turner? Lots of twists, turns and reversals. Marlowe provides a graph that shows the plot trajectory of a bestseller that is structured in a manner similar to your story. This does not necessarily mean that your book is at all similar in terms of subject matter or style, but it does suggest that the emotional experience of your readers will be similar. The Da Vinci Code and Fifty Shades of Grey are very different books, but it turns out they have very similar plot trajectories. Readers consistently describe both books as page-turners. Knowing about other books with similar plotlines will help you understand the experience readers will have as they traverse your narrative.\n\nBook comps\n\nAs part of their Marlowe Pro report, authors who run a manuscript through our AI see a rich set of book comps, with your book assessed against the thousands of bestsellers in our data library. (We continue to expand our corpus every month.) If your book stacks up, you may see how closely your book compares to a title from Stephen King, Danielle Steel, Brandon Sanderson or, in my case, James Patterson. It’s a kick, and it’s also a positively affirming feeling. You may want to head to BingeBooks to buy their book to compare.\n\nOther features\n\nYou’ll also find analysis of major character traits in Marlowe — as well as in Pro Writing Aid, AutoCrit and Sudowrite. Your mileage may vary. Similarly, you’ll find a breakdown of dialogue vs. narrative, a primary emotions color wheel and a helpful cliche finder.\n\nOne of my favorite features (which only Sudowrite has in this faceoff) is the explicit language finder. You’d be surprised how often you’ll find profane words in your manuscript that, at second blush, ought to come out during the second draft. Or, if you write saucy romance novels, you may decide that 900 f-bombs are a tad too much. (That’s right, we add ’em up for you.)\n\nOK, that’s how Marlowe stacks up against some of the other major author tools in the market. There are others, of course: Hemingway, Ginger and Plottr, to name a few. And if you want a generative AI that turn out prose for you to consider, Sudowrite, Claude, ChatGPT and Gemini are your top options right now.",

Announcement\n\n🖋️ Writing Not Safe for Work (NSFW) Content Using AI\n\nIn this article, we will delve into the often discussed but rarely addressed topic of writing not safe for work (NSFW) content using AI. Many writers have wondered about the possibilities and limitations of AI in tackling explicit themes, and with a recent update from Pseudoite, the process has become much more accessible. As someone who primarily writes clean fiction, I initially hesitated to cover this topic, but the advancements in AI technology have compelled me to provide insights into this subject. So, let's explore the various methods and considerations involved in incorporating NSFW content into your writing.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBefore we delve into the nuances of AI-generated NSFW content, let's discuss the recent update from Pseudoite that has made this process easier. Pseudoite's StoryEngine, while offering various features such as brain dumps, character outlines, and synopses, now includes a new option in the Pros section - unfiltered content. This update allows writers to explore explicit themes, including sex, violence, and horror, in their AI-generated prose. It is important to note that Pseudoite is utilizing an open-source model called MannerWeaver for this feature.\n\nUnderstanding the New Update from Pseudoite\n\nThe latest update from Pseudoite offers writers the freedom to generate unfiltered NSFW content by selecting the \"sex violence and horror welcome\" option in the Pros section. While the generated prose may not be as natural-sounding as those produced by other models like Claude, it still serves its purpose. The pros feature in Pseudoite presents a moderate level of quality, capable of producing dramatic and engaging scenes. However, it is crucial to remember that AI models like Claude remain the most effective choice for the majority of your writing, especially in creative situations.\n\nOther Methods for Writing NSFW Content\n\nApart from Pseudoite, there are other AI platforms that writers can utilize for generating NSFW content. One such platform is novel ai, which allows users to input their manuscript and guide the AI to create desired scenes with explicit content. Though there are some limitations in terms of content generation, the pros generated by Novel AI maintain a satisfactory level of quality.\n\nAdditionally, OpenAI's ChatGPT provides an avenue for writers to directly interact with various AI models. Notably, the Myax, MannerWeaver, and Mistol models stand out in terms of their ability to generate NSFW content. While these models may not match the natural pros of Claude, they offer a viable alternative to explore when writing explicit scenes.\n\nTips for Writing NSFW Content with AI\n\nWhen it comes to writing NSFW content with AI, it is important to follow a few guidelines to ensure the overall quality and coherence of your work.\n\nFirstly, it is recommended to write the bulk of your content using models like Claude or ChatGPT. These models excel in generating natural and engaging prose while maintaining a safe level of censorship for most writing purposes. By leveraging the accuracy and quality of these models, you can create a compelling narrative.\n\nFor specific scenes that require explicit content, you can pause the current model and switch to Pseudoite's unfiltered Pros generator. This approach allows you to maintain consistency by emulating the quality of the preceding text and generating the desired NSFW content when necessary.\n\nMoreover, it is crucial to tone down the explicit elements in your Outline. By writing the majority of the story with a PG-13 approach, you can focus on key scenes and apply the necessary explicit details later. Remember that explicit sections often make up a relatively small portion of a story, and by strategically incorporating them, you can enhance the overall impact without sacrificing the quality of the prose.\n\nExploring Alternative AI Models\n\nIn addition to Pseudoite and Novel AI, other AI models like MannerWeaver and Mistol offer alternatives for generating NSFW content. MannerWeaver, the model used by Pseudoite, provides a larger context window compared to Claude, which can enhance the quality of the generated unfiltered prose. Mistol is another AI model worth exploring for NSFW content generation. While these models may not match the natural pros of Claude, they offer viable options for writers seeking diversity in their AI-generated NSFW content.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe topic of writing not safe for work (NSFW) content using AI has always been a point of Curiosity and interest. With Pseudoite's recent update and the availability of various AI models, this process has become more accessible. By following the recommended approaches and leveraging the capabilities of different models, writers can incorporate explicit themes into their work without compromising the quality and coherence of their prose.\n\nAnnouncement\n\nStay tuned for an important announcement tomorrow! Check back at 7:30 PM Eastern Time for an exciting update that is sure to resonate with all writers.\n\nHighlights:\n\nWriters can now explore writing not safe for work (NSFW) content using AI, with advancements in technology making it more accessible.\n\nPseudoite's recent update introduces unfiltered content generation for explicit themes, utilizing the MannerWeaver model.\n\nOther platforms like Novel AI and OpenAI's ChatGPT also offer options for generating NSFW content.\n\nTips for writing NSFW content include using models like Claude or ChatGPT for the bulk of the content and switching to Pseudoite's unfiltered Pros generator for specific scenes.\n\nToning down explicit elements in the outline can help maintain a balance between explicit and clean content.\n\nAlternative models like MannerWeaver and Mistol provide additional options for generating NSFW content.\n\nThe overall quality and coherence of the prose should be prioritized when incorporating NSFW content using AI.\n\nAn exciting announcement is coming soon! Stay tuned for more details.\n\nFAQ\n\nQ: Can AI models like Claude generate explicit content naturally? A: AI models like Claude can generate high-quality natural prose; however, explicit content may require the use of unfiltered Pros generators or alternative AI models.\n\nQ: Are there any limitations when using AI for NSFW content? A: While AI models have made significant advancements, there may still be limitations in generating nuanced and contextually accurate NSFW content. Writers need to be aware of these limitations and use AI as a tool rather than relying solely on it.\n\nQ: What are some key considerations when writing NSFW content using AI? A: It is important to strike a balance between explicit and clean content, utilize appropriate models for different sections, and maintain the overall coherence and quality of the prose.\n\nQ: Are there legal and ethical concerns associated with using AI to generate NSFW content? A: Yes, there are legal and ethical considerations. Writers should ensure compliance with content regulations and use AI-generated content responsibly and within the boundaries of legality and ethics.\n\nResources:"
