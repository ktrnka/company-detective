      "# [Sudowrite Muse, the only AI model made for fiction](https://www.sudowrite.com/muse)\nIn the year 2150, Earth had undergone a remarkable transformation. Thanks to decades of scientific innovation and global cooperation, the once barren and polluted planet had been revitalized into a lush paradise. The effects of climate change had been reversed, and nature had reclaimed its rightful place. One of the most remarkable achievements of this new era was the creation of the Green Oasis, a sprawling biodome that housed a vibrant ecosystem of plant and animal life. Located in what was once the desolate Sahara Desert, the Green Oasis was a testament to humanity's ability to restore balance to the natural world. Inside the biodome, the air was rich with the scent of flowers and the sound of birdsong. Lush greenery covered every surface, from the forest floor to the canopy above. Streams meandered through the landscape, teeming with fish and other aquatic creatures. It was a thriving ecosystem, carefully curated and maintained by a team of dedicated scientists and environmentalists. Among the inhabitants of the Green Oasis was Dr. Maya Chen, a brilliant botanist who had dedicated her life to the restoration of Earth's ecosystems. As she walked through the biodome, she couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the beauty and diversity of life that surrounded her.\n\nIn the year 2150, Earth had undergone a remarkable transformation.

      "# [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](https://www.sudowrite.com/faq)\nWhat languages does Sudowrite work in? You can write in almost any language. Click Write, and Sudowrite will match your language when it offers suggestions. When using other features, Sudowrite may fall back on English when it isn’t sure. Try it out in our free trial to see how it works for you!\n\nIs this magic? Yes. But so is life, isn’t it?\n\nDo you claim any rights or ownership over what I write in Sudowrite? We claim no rights over anything you put into Sudowrite, nor anything Sudowrite generates for you.\n\nCan Sudowrite plagiarize? The short answer is, Sudowrite won't plagiarize unless you explicitly force it to plagiarize, which is against our terms of service.\n\nThe AI works by guessing one word at a time, based on general concepts it has learned from billions of samples of text. So it's extremely unlikely to produce the same words verbatim, or even ever again. It does not copy and paste chunks of text, it guesses each word (technically, parts of words), one at a time.\n\nThe only way to get Sudowrite to plagiarize is to put in text it’s seen before verbatim, like the lyrics of an popular song, or the first paragraph of an extremely popular book like Harry Potter. As long as your own writing is original, you'll get more original writing out of Sudowrite. We encourage you to try plagiarism checkers to verify your results.\n\nIs this cheating? Sudowrite is a tool for creativity. It's not intended to write for you, but can help you vastly improve and speed up your writing. Just as a great writing partner can help you bust through when you're stuck or be a sounding board to bounce ideas off of, Sudowrite makes writing more fun, faster, and less solitary.\n\nWhat public language models does Sudowrite use and how were they trained? We use dozens of AI models, including the latest Claude models by Anthropic, multiple open source models, in-house models, and several variants of GPT-4, transformer models created by OpenAI. OpenAI trained their models on: (1) a version of the CommonCrawl dataset, filtered based on similarity to high-quality reference corpora, (2) an expanded version of the Webtext dataset, (3) two internet-based book corpora, and (4) English-language Wikipedia. We pair these models with a variety of proprietary narrative model-based and algorithmic pre- and post-processing to enable AI writing features not available anywhere else.\n\nDoes Sudowrite use my writing to train models? We are constantly listening to writers' feedback to improve Sudowrite. However, we do not use your writing to train AI models.\n\nBefore I sign up, how do I cancel? It’s easy. Go to your subscription page and hit cancel. No phone calls, no nonsense.\n\nIf I cancel, do I lose access to what I’ve written in Sudowrite? You can always access and work on your projects in Sudowrite, but won’t be able to use AI features without a paid plan. We will never hold your writing hostage.",

      "# [30 Writing Prompts for Valentine's Day by Christina Drury on 2025-02-14](https://sudowrite.com/blog/untitled/)\nValentine's Day, the universal day of love, is just about upon us. You know what that means … stories with all the feels! If you've wanted to write a romance novel centered around the holiday, now's your chance.\n\nBut sometimes, we just need a little help getting our stories started and writing prompts are a great way to get some inspiration. Even if you don't follow the prompts to the \"T,\" they provide a jumping-off point that could lead to your next short story or even bestseller.\n\nWhether you write rom-coms, suspense romances, romantasy, or supernatural romances, we've got some prompts to get those wheels turning.\n\nLet's start out with some simple ideas.\n\n1. Write a scene where your love interests share their first kiss. What are their inner musings?\n\n2. What does your protagonist really like about their love interest? Wax poetic about it from their point of view.\n\n3. Write a scene based on your favorite love song.\n\n4. A chance meeting at an airport leads to an unexpected love connection, but there are challenges. What are they and how does our couple overcome them?\n\n5. A librarian begins receiving love notes tucked inside books. Who are they from?\n\n6. Two people meet repeatedly, year after year, on Valentine's Day by sheer coincidence. What are their stories and could it lead to more?\n\n7. A wedding planner opens an office across the hall from a divorce attorney. What could possibly go wrong (or right)?\n\n8. A magical cafe has a single table but only allows two strangers to occupy it. There's a legend that every couple who meets there falls in love.\n\n9. Two people in neighboring apartments start having conversations through their balconies. Do these conversations lead to more? Unexpectedly falling in love, perhaps?\n\n10. The protagonist discovers a romance novel with their own love story within, up until the present time. What happens next?\n\n11. Write a story about a character who dials a wrong number, yet ends up in a fantastic conversation with a stranger. They agree to meet without exchanging names.\n\n12. A character hires a love coach after multiple failed relationships, but falls for the love coach. How do they navigate the ethical implications?\n\n13. Unexpected gifts keep arriving. They're deeply personal, thoughtful, sweet, and funny. The sender is someone they never expected.\n\n14. Rival wedding planners must work together to create the wedding of the century. As they battle, they begin to fall in love.\n\nNeed some more meat to get you started? Let's get a little more complex!\n\n1. Write a story about someone who receives a love letter in the mail, dated 10 years ago. For some reason, it was never delivered. The sender? Their first love, who is now engaged to someone else. Even stranger? They wouldn't have the protagonist's current address.\n\n2. The protagonist is single on the holiday and decides to join a Valentine's Day challenge. Who shows up but their worst enemy … and they're paired together. They need to navigate to solve the puzzle, but butt heads initially. When they finally start working together, they realize they have more in common than they thought.\n\n3. Write a story about a protagonist who wakes up on Valentine's Day unable to remember the past six months. They're shocked to find a ring on their finger, and even more shocked to find they are engaged to someone they know they'd never marry. What's happening?\n\n4. It's Valentine's Day … again. Time is looping, repeating the same day over and over. Your protagonist goes on a date with a different person each time. It won't stop until the protagonist meets the one he or she is supposed to be with. Who is it?\n\n5. Your protagonist is visiting an old bookstore where they find an old love letter in a book. Curious, they open it. It's addressed to the protagonist, but is too old to have been written in their lifetime. Is there a stronger force at play here?\n\n6. A snowstorm has wreaked havoc on your protagonist's V-Day plans. Now, they're stuck in the snow with just one house on the road. When they get to the house, they're shocked to see their ex-spouse. Things ended badly, but it seems they got a second chance. Will they work things out or will they end worse than before?\n\n7. The ex is getting married and for some reason invited your protagonist. Not wanting to lose face, they ask their best friend to pretend to be their lover leading up to the wedding. Real feelings emerge. How does it play out?\n\n8. Back in high school, the two love interests make a pact. If they're still single by V-Day when they're 30, they will go on a date together. Sure enough, they are still single, but life has taken them both down unexpected paths. Will this encounter lead to more or are they both too jaded to take a chance?\n\n9. Your protagonist receives a heartfelt confession on Valentine's Day, but it's a wrong number. They ignore it, but more texts come in and they realize the relationship is falling apart. Do they play matchmaker and try to fix it, or convince the sender to move on… with them, perhaps?\n\n10. Your protagonist has a premonition about a crime about to happen at a wedding on Valentine's Day of all places. They race to stop the crime (and the wedding). Once the crisis is averted, they discover the bride or groom is their ex, the one they never got over. Was this fate or just a very weird coincidence?\n\n11. A witch who brews potions for others accidentally consumes their own love spell concoction on Valentine's Day. They find themselves drawn to the last person they ever expected.\n\n12. Your heroine sends an over-the-top V-Day card to their work rival as a joke, but the card somehow ends up on their billionaire boss' desk. Hilarity ensues as the boss thinks the heroine is head over heels for them.\n\n13. The protagonist makes a bet with their best friend. Pick anyone and they will get a date with them by Valentine's Day. The friend makes the challenge difficult by picking someone who would never go for them.\n\n14. Your protagonist makes a pact with their best friend to avoid anything romantic on the holiday. Yet, with everything they do, something ridiculously romantic happens. Is fate trying to push them together?\n\n15. Your protagonist signs up for the latest reality TV dating show to find they're paired with their worst enemy. Yet, facing elimination, they discover their feelings are the real deal.\n\n16. Your protagonist is a cynic who doesn't believe in love because of a past experience. Now, they're thrown back in that person's orbit and things apparently weren't what they seemed at the time. How does it affect them?\n\nNow, let those creative juices flow!\n\nBut, don't feel that you need to be pigeonholed into one of these ideas exactly as they are. I'm a strong advocate for mixing and matching prompts until you get something that's uniquely you. After all, some of the best stories are a modge podge of ideas that seemingly shouldn't work on paper but come together beautifully.\n\n(and let's be honest, it's good to break away from the formulaic stories now and again, even if that's what the romance genre is based on.)\n\nWant to turn one (or more) of these prompts into a full-fledged romance novel?

It is amazing for helping get my ideas and characters into a tight outline.\n\nBut I dispute that the content can pass for an actual novel or match tones. People get more and more heavily into complex headers and guardrails and style guide and beats and genre, but the output still has \"that AI feel\"--piercing blue eyes, tidy bows, affirmations, cliches, rushing through scenes, etc. \n\nI'm not aware of anything that has the same full-suite features and structures as Sudowrite. \n\nFor matching tones, NovelAi is the best and cheapest, because it is guided by what you write and picks up your tones and characterisation in a quite amazing way. And it lets you tinker a lot under the hood. But it doesn't help at all with structuring and plotting, which IMO is Sudo's strength.\n\nIt's possible that what would work for you best is a free LLM like LLama2 or CGPT for plotting and character sketches, and NA for actual writing (copy the character sketches into Lorebooks). Even the cheapest tier of NA had the highest level of context and unlimited generations with Clio, which is a pretty good model.\n\n#### Comment ID k3crgss with +2 score by [(NoYesterday7832, Reddit, 2023-10-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/k3crgss/) (in reply to ID k3codl8):\nHow are you doing that?

      "# Post ID 193gi4w: Struggling with Sudowrite with +18 score by [(PartyMuffinButton, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/)\nI had NovelAI for a while, and was quite happy with it, but it was very back-n-forth, and I was editing (or fully rewriting) a lot of its output. Whenever I ran the story stats, it was at least 85% my content. And that’s fine! But I was really looking for something that would take my prose and _run with it_, so I decided to try out Sudowrite. \n\nI literally only just got started, but already I’m feeling a bit _ugh_ about the whole thing. I spent around 3 hours creating all of my backstory, character definitions, example writing, etc. I was very specific about the perspective (‘I’ am the narrator, ‘you’ are the main character, as if I’m telling the story _to you_). \n\nImmediately, it got it wrong. It started writing in the first person for the wrong character. And despite giving it a decent example of my writing and style, it sounded absolutely nothing like me. So I paused it, intent on correcting it… and it just _kept going_. For minutes. It spat out around a thousand words before it finally decided to pause. \n\nI then spent another hour rewriting almost _all_ of that first block - changing the character perspective, rewriting big chunks of it, and then adding some of my own, carrying the story on (and following my predefined beats).\n\nI finally got to a good jumping-off point and inserted it over the previously-generated text, then hit ‘continue’…\n\n…and it just kicked off as if I’d done nothing. It started from exactly where I’d stopped it before, ignoring everything I’d written. It immediately jumped back to writing the character from the first-person (rather than the second), and with that same pulp-fiction prose that sounds nothing like me.\n\nI’ve used a fair few generative AI tools, and what I’m used to is them taking the backstory/permanent memory/definitions etc., and then the _context_ of what’s been written (like its ‘short-term memory’) to inform what it writes next. But Sudowrite seemed to just… ignore me?\n\nI assume I’m doing something wrong, but I’ve got no idea how to fix it. I know Sudowrite have a Discord, but I find group-chat apps way too _noisy_.\n\nHas anyone got any experience with this, and any tips on how to ~~shove~~ nudge it in the direction I want?\n\n## Comment ID kh99cvl with +6 score by [(ironic_cat555, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/kh99cvl/) (in reply to ID 193gi4w):\nIsn't I am the narrator and I'm telling the story to you second person?  If so a more detailed explanation than second person might just confuse it.\n\nIf you are using the story engine feature Sudowrite's story engine doesn't really have the ability to analyze your writing style.  When you upload your writing sample all it does is generate a description of your writing style.  Which means they pass that description on to the AI not your prose.   I don't know if generating prose in the chapter, kind of like NovelAI rather than in story engine would work better.\n\nStart off by generating small amounts of text (just 2 to 4 beats) and see if you can get it to work how you want it to.  Then it won't continue writing for a long time.\n\nAlso the discord has a lot of helpful people in it. \n\nThat said if you are usually doing SFW stuff you might be better off trying Claude 2.

He explained that it used to be a separate thing, but now they’ve bundled everything together, so Sudowrite _is_ story engine now, from what I can gather.\n\nI’ll try with shorter beats and see how it goes, but I think I’ve found a major flaw in how it generates stories, and I’m worried I might now be stuck without erasing everything and starting again (basically it iterates through ‘beats’ and when I go back and ~~rewrite everything~~ correct it, setting the story back a little bit, it both a) continues to ignore my style, and 2) gets confused about where it is.

Story engine is now the Chapter Generator feature.  But there's an alternative way to generate prose which is using the \"write\" \"rewrite\" \"describe\" buttons in the chapter text area.  That's the one more like Novel AI that I  meant.\n\nIf the story engine is screwing up just pause it, it'll only go to the end of the current two beats, then change the instructions in the beats then hit restart after deleting the bad prose and try again.  \"Most accurate\" is the ai most likely to follow your instructions.\n\n#### Comment ID khabap9 with +1 score by [(superamit, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/khabap9/) (in reply to ID kha7mdd):\nWere you putting \"Second-person POV\" in the style?

That's tricky to offer advice for since a lot of it is just about having the right kind of gut feeling to play into the AI's strength, and the the only way to get that is through the experience of using it.\n\nIn particular to the output length, I don't try to extend past the default, but instead I just generate multiple times if I feel like the AI is hitting a good vibe. There are a number of things which are only reevaluated when a new generation starts (chief among them being lorebook keys), so my impression is that the quality of long outputs tends to degrade severely over time.\n\n## Comment ID lgnijn0 with +4 score by [(whywhatwhenwhoops, Reddit, 2024-08-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/1ekf637/is_there_a_way_to_make_novelai_similar_to/lgnijn0/) (in reply to ID 1ekf637):\nWhat do mean by a config more like sudowrite?

Author is self-explanatory (just needs to be well-known enough that the model gets the reference). Title can be anything that sort of conveys the feel or topic. Tags can be words or phrases that convey themes and concepts you want in the story, comma-delineated if you want to use multiple, just don't go overboard). And Genre should be a well-established genre term, such as the lists of literary genres found on Wikipedia or Amazon.\n\nYou can leave out fields you don't want to use, just maintain the format (spaces between the brackets and the tag line, and each field separated by semicolons).\n\nStyle is fairly flexible. It should be a comma-delineated list of words or phrases (like Tags), but more about the kind of writing you want to see. There are trained in phrases (such as \"prose\", \"complex\", etc...), but many words will work (\"descriptive\", \"sensory\", etc...). [Here are some examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/18corhv/style_tags_for_sensory_language/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) of sensory language tags, but there is no fixed list, so feel free to experiment with soemthing that you think might fit your story.\n\nEdit: Beyond that, play around with different config presets, maybe try out some of the community ones from Discord. Between all of these, you can get extremely evocative writing that puts pretty much any other AI to shame. \"Logic\" is still a weak point though.\n\n## Comment ID lgtkws3 with +2 score by [(bobsburger4776, Reddit, 2024-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/1ekf637/is_there_a_way_to_make_novelai_similar_to/lgtkws3/) (in reply to ID 1ekf637):\nIs sudowrtie completely uncensored now?

It’s a great way to get a ton of value. Plus, Sudowrite's Quick Tools, like *Quick Edit* and *Quick Chat*, are *unlimited* and included free with the plans. I'm always using them to make light edits or have a chat directly within my document, making the writing process smoother and more integrated.\n\nHere's an example of prose generated using your sentence starter with the Chat4o Mini model:\n\n>She inspects the hammer with careful precision, her fingers lightly tracing the worn wooden handle. It had seen better days—splintered at the edge, coated in a fine layer of dust that hinted at years of neglect. But it was its head that intrigued her most. The metal glinted under the flickering fluorescent light, marred by splotches of something dark and unidentifiable.\n\n>Marjorie glanced around the cramped workshop, the air thick with the scent of rust and old wood. The walls were lined with tools of all kinds, each one telling a story she was desperate to unravel. But this hammer… it felt crucial. The sound of distant sirens echoed through the open window. Time was running out.\n\n>Her heart raced as she replayed the events of the night before—the confrontation with Richard, his wild accusations, then that chilling silence when he’d stormed out into the rain. She had thought it was just another argument, another moment lost in their spiraling relationship. But now? Now she understood there was something darker at play.\n\n>She slipped a small flashlight from her pocket and directed its beam onto the workbench beside her. There, half-hidden beneath a pile of scrap metal, lay a crumpled piece of paper. Instinct told her to be cautious, but curiosity drove her closer. As she extended her hand, her eyes caught more stains on the floor—ominous dark patches that trailed from the bench to the back door.\n\n>Was Richard here? Or had someone else entered this place during their fight? The questions ignited a fire in her gut that made her pulse quicken. Marjorie hesitated only a moment longer before unfolding the paper, every creak and crinkle seeming thunderous in the tense air around her.\n\n>Words began to form —a name scrawled hastily across the top: Arthur Blackwood. Her breath hitched in her throat as realization dawned; Arthur—the man who had disappeared without a trace two weeks prior. She had assumed he was simply another casualty in their chaotic town, but this suggested otherwise.\n\n>The sirens grew louder, pulling her from thoughts spiraling into darkness. She had to move—had to find out what connection this hammer, and those stains held to Arthur's fate before someone else made their way through that door behind her and erased everything once and for all.",

NC with the API key though OpenRouter (so it’s just 1 key) lets me play with so so many different models. And NC let’s you customize prompts, wheat SW doesn’t. I like having that level of control. Once you get used to it, I’ve found it to be much better and cheaper than SW. That’s just my opinion, though. I definitely encourage anyone who is new to AI tools to try them out and see what works for you and your process.\n\n### Comment ID ldehxh5 with +1 score by [(ecchirhino99, Reddit, 2024-07-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/ldehxh5/) (in reply to ID ldef2r9):\nTo use novelcrafter to chat edit(review) a scene you need tier 3 subscription artisan tier?

Tier 3 gives you additional features like Workshop. I'm not sure what all that is, as I've been using NC since it was in beta and got access to the paid version right when it was released. \n\nMost people use OpenRouter for the credits, and the price per model is set by them/the LLM provider (NC has no control over model prices).

It’s a workhorse, and they are always working on updates that people actually want.\n\nAt the same time, if you’re not ready to take the plunge, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with just using TypingMind and connect it to your OpenRouter account. If you’re just inserting beats into an existing scene, chat might be all you need.\n\nAlso consider the possibility that if what you really want is fresh, original, truly creative writing that the world has never seen before, written in a voice that is all your own, then you’re going to have to write it yourself. The cost is your time and maybe some overdue fees at the library.\n\n### Comment ID ldfuq2o with +3 score by [(ecchirhino99, Reddit, 2024-07-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/ldfuq2o/) (in reply to ID ldex7y1):\nWhile testing novelcrafter, I can see now that sudowrite cost of prompts seem to be inflated to the extreme.

It allowed for some pretty cool stuff. \n\nThen I switched to NovelAI and liked it a LOT better. It was far easier to use it as a writing assistant without needing convoluted prompts. \n\nThen I started using GPT-3 directly in the playground. I found myself mostly using the playground vs NovelAI. It was likely more expensive (pay per use rather than monthly) but I found the results were MUCH better - especially with short prompts (I had the playground write a beat sheet for a novel without any further explanation and it did a good job!)\n\nI tried Goose playground as well and found it was a lot weaker. \n\nMore recently I have been using Sudowrite. I have been VERY impressed. It uses GPT3 as its backend but I have found the stuff I get from it is better than my attempts in the playground (they must have really optimized the prompts in the background somehow). And the pricing is right (I wonder if they will just lose money on some hard core users?)\n\nHas anyone else here compared the two? What do people find NovelAI better for? I can’t imagine not using Sudo now, but if there are strong NovelAI use cases I am missing I am price insensitive enough I could subscribe to both….\n\n## Comment ID i7mhn7a with +19 score by [(superamit, Reddit, 2022-05-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/i7mhn7a/) (in reply to ID uj4zg7):\nGlad to hear you're enjoying Sudowrite!\n\nWe do a lot of work under the hood to tune our prompts for fiction, as well as doing pre/post-processing to improve quality.\n\nIf you have any questions about Sudowrite, feel free to ask!\n\nAmit\nCo-Founder, Sudowrite\n\n### Comment ID iy17l1y with +2 score by [(Firm-Engineering2948, Reddit, 2022-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/iy17l1y/) (in reply to ID i7mhn7a):\nHi\n\nI'm currently trying to use Sudowrite free trial on my phone.\n\nAs soon as I get to the \"insert\" part, I cannot continue because of screen size.

      "# Post ID 1dvnmix: My Experience with Sudowrite with +20 score by [(Direct-Secretary-279, Reddit, 2024-07-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1dvnmix/my_experience_with_sudowrite/)\nI thought I'd share some thoughts for those curious about this program, especially since they have been hitting the advertising hard on Facebook lately.\n\nI went to check it out almost a year ago now. According to my history I uploaded my 90% completed manuscript on August 8th 2023.  I was having some writer's block and figured it couldn't hurt. On that piece I used primarily the Write feature in Auto mode. It got me through my writer's block and now that I've done one full edit and am in the middle of the second there is only one paragraph that I still recognise as being the AI's writing and not mine.  I haven't gotten to the chapter (third from the end) in the second edit so by the time I'm finished that should be corrected.\n\nMy day job is in taxes so I have a big chunk of the summer off.  I decided that $20 for a single month was worth trying out in my free time and despite finishing the first book in the series in late August, I had only been able to get three chapters into book 2.\n\nBetween August 2023 and April 2024 Sudowrite has made many changes including expanding the story bible to include better character bios. Since I was starting basically from scratch, I took the time to complete every field and truthfully it took me from early April to mid June. I was able to link my existing chapters to the outline and then, because I didn't have enough trial credits left I made my purchase and then I used the the generate chapter feature.\n\nI used the generate beat for the chapter and the beats progressed exactly the way they should. When I then generated the chapter.... OH MAN...  I was not prepared for it to be THAT BAD!!  I'd used the write feature to just pick up where I stopped and that is solidly useful. Even if I only use one sentence, it always helps me get moving again.\n\nThe generate chapter AI however was bad.  There were lets say 10 beats in the chapter and each beat was about a sentence. The subsequent generation transitioned beat1-2, 2-3, 3-4, etc. and the amount of the same characters reentering rooms they were already in, completing the same action again but with a different side action, or other junk writing was EVERYWHERE!!!  \n\nI wrote an extremely long email to Sudowrite with examples galore. I wasn't nice about how bad I thought it was compared to their other features and that for the time being they weren't going to get any more of my money.  \n\nBut now I had hundreds of thousands of credits and I still had all this free time.  So I kept working with it.  At first I just use the Write feature again, sometimes Guided and other times Auto. I got two chapters done quick and I felt like it was all moving. \n\nTo back track a bit, my biggest complaint with Chapter Generation wasn't even the repetition. My biggest issue was that the Story Bible knew the secret, knew the answer to the mystery and it kept wanting to spoil that!  Every other paragraph it was talking about the secret that wasn't supposed to be anything more than odd behavior until the middle of Act 2. The write feature didn't do this to me.\n\nWell, I saw their post that they had rolled out an update and I also went back to look at the beats the AI had created for me.  I saw that at least some of the problem had been that the beats were too detailed and I reread the directions to make sure that each beat could generate about 200 words worth of content. Alright. Time to try again.\n\nI generated beats for my next chapter and then refined them from 16 down to 7 with three sentences each. I made sure none of the action between beats overlapped. You know what?  It was very usable!  I was able to take the 12 to 16 paragraphs it generated and expand that out to almost 3000 words without having to remove large chunks. It did what Sudowrite's mission says its going to do. They say that writing is mostly about editing and refining so why not spend your time there. I was very happy.  \n\nAs I kept playing with the tools it became clear that if I knew how I wanted a scene to go then I should just write that scene (or whole chapter) but the upgrade of both the engine and my skill worked well.\n\nEven better: the upgrade stopped the leaking of the secret!  \n\nThe best (for me) however was that in getting the 'second perspective' of the AI, followed by the third perspective of my boyfriend, I realized that the reason I had been so stuck was that I was trying too hard to hold on to my secret. I realized that without the characters knowing something about it (It in my case being a made up synthetic drug with specific effects) the characters had to attribute the actions of the person effected by the drug as being part of who they are and that wasn't the story I wanted to tell.  I want to tell the story of how the MC's friends gather around her to help her fight back against the drug and the people who dosed her with it.\n\nSudowrite helped me fix my plot and now I'm writing it on my own at the same rapid pace I wrote the first book in the series.  It was absolutely worth the cost for the help alone.  The skills I learned in the meantime on how to better utilize it: well they let me finish some side pieces never to published for profit in a week each. \n\n\n\n## Comment ID lbt8kox with +6 score by [(KaristinaLaFae, Reddit, 2024-07-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1dvnmix/my_experience_with_sudowrite/lbt8kox/) (in reply to ID 1dvnmix):\nSudowrite can help you do a lot, but it helps if you know what all the features are and how to use them.

I used it for over a year but recently ditched it for Raptor Write. I still use Chat though. It seems like a lot of writers outgrow SW after a while. The concept is outdated now. When SW started, it was the only AI really for writing but now it's been left in the dust for newer things. Having your own API key is the best option because you have access to so many more AIs and you can control the costs. SW is insanely expensive. I was spending $29 a month for SW and didn't even use half of the credits and with Openrouter, it can take me weeks to use up $8 worth of credits while finishing even more projects than I do with SW. Plus, compared to other things, SW is clunky, the prose is bad, and I also don't like how SW doesn't roll credits over. That's a big problem for a lot of the users and why so many move on.\n\nI'm not knocking SW for others who feel it works best for them. We are all different but for me I can't justify spending $29 a month for AI when I can get just as much done through OR and not even spend $10 a month. SW turned into a big waste of money because it got to where I wasn't even using it much anymore and would have a million wasted credits. I also didn't find the quality that good anymore. I don't know why the prose from AIs like Claude are so much worse through SW than when you use them directly with your own API key. And I'm not the only one to notice this. Is SW using different versions of these AIs? Inferior versions? I don't know but the qualities of AIs offered through SW aren't half as good as just using the AI yourself.\n\nI do wonder if SW will ever allow the option of letting people use their own API key because with the way it is now, I don't see how SW is going to last much longer with all the competition and how expensive they are. When SW started, they had a lock on the writing AIs but not anymore and I bet in 2025 we'll see even more options come along. For example, Raptor Write is free, you just pay for the AI through Openrouter and can write a day of work without spending even a dollar if you know which AIs to use. The quality of using APIs through your own key is much better and cheaper than SW and that's the way the AI world is trending now.\n\n## Comment ID lbpfbgp with +1 score by [(ironic_cat555, Reddit, 2024-07-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1dvnmix/my_experience_with_sudowrite/lbpfbgp/) (in reply to ID 1dvnmix):\nAs an experiment I tried recently turning a professional novel into story beats, and it just doesn't  make sense to have these small one sentence story beats I think.\n\nGoogle Gemini if prodded to be detailed will have a story beat often consist of three small sub beats bullet points like this effectively three to four sentences:\n\n**2.

If you bought 4 instances of tier 2 somehow, you would have 360,000 words, not 300,000.\n\nWhat they SHOULD be offering is:\n\n$10 - 30,000\n\n$25 - 150,000\n\n$100 - 2,000,000\n\nBut even if these were the prices they offered, you STILL shouldn't use Sudowrite. By doing so, you're enabling grifters instead of the open-source movement. AI writing tools like this should be free.\n\nDon't enable grifters.

The difference is that Novelcrafter’s “Codex” (the equivalent of Sudowrite’s “Story Bible”), Scene summaries and all other things you can pre-establish, are considerably more flexible and, to some extent, Novelcrafter “expects” you to use them to guide the generation.

I've got it working pretty well here.  Maybe I can offer some suggestions.\n\nIt's important to understand which codex entries are visible to the AI.  Your characters, for example. . .  When you create a new codex entry and select \"character\" type, it should *track* that entry.  What that means is, if NC sees that character name in your prompt, then it'll provide that codex entry to the LLM.  It'll become part of the context for that scene.  So when you are writing your prompt for a scene beat, you should mention all the characters who are present in that scene *by name*.  You may have dozens of characters in your story, but NC will only show the LLM its cards for the ones that you mentioned in the prompt.  That keeps the LLM from being overwhelmed with too much information that's not relevant.\n\nYou can go into the **Plan** tab and then the **Matrix** view, and Novelcrafter will show you a grid with all the characters it's tracking, and which scenes they appear in.\n\nRaces. . .  Let's say you have a race of \"gnomes\" in your story.  If you haven't mentioned the word \"gnome\" in your prompt, the LLM might never get the info.  There are a couple of ways to fix this.  One is to go into the entries for your gnome characters and give each of them a Nested Reference to the gnome race.  Then, any time one of those characters gets pulled into the context, the card on gnomes gets pulled in too.  You can also do that with factions that various characters are members of, etc.\n\nIn each codex entry you can find a tab called **References** and a couple of options under **REFERENCE TRACKING**.  One option you can check is \"Always include this entry in the AI context.\"  If you switch that on, then the card will *always* be visible to the LLM.  You want to use this for things like genre and style that always apply to every part of your story.  You can also use it for important bits of lore.  The only reason not to over-use it is, like I said, to not overwhelm the LLM with the entire contents of your Codex and stuff that's not relevant to the task.\n\nAll of the *scene summaries* are also part of the LLM context!  That means keeping your scene summaries up-to-date is super helpful to the AI knowing where it is and what it's doing.  You can get your choice of AI to write those summaries for you, so there's no excuse.  Once you have a scene completed to your satisfaction, with a few clicks you can have the AI reading it and writing a summary of the important events, which then becomes part of its knowledge base for generating future scenes.\n\nIf you are set up with OpenRouter, you have a lot of LLMs available, and you can experiment freely.  However. . .  In my experience there are only a few that give top results.  ChatGPT is always reliable.  At this moment, Claude was recently updated and produces the very best output.  Claude has become pretty smart, and if he is routinely getting confused, it almost certainly means that he's not getting the context he needs from Novelcrafter.\n\n## Comment ID krrh7w8 with +4 score by [(MeridianASK, Reddit, 2024-02-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/krrh7w8/) (in reply to ID 1akj00y):\nDon't use any of them.

Novelcrafter is great with OpenRouter, and allows you to use a shitload of models - but Sudowrite has a good spread of them too. \n\nOverall, I'd say **NovelAI** is the best all-rounder. It's cheaper for heavy users since there's no character limit, but you do sometimes need to get a little more into the settings and lore memory to get results you like. But it's fast, flexible, has a nice UI, and will let you type 24/7 for as long as you like. \n\n**Novelcrafter** is a close second to **Sudowrite** for me. I really like Novelcrafter - Openrouter gets you a ton of versatility for really *cheap* - but frankly, 75% of those models aren't really going to see use. What's more, I've found it kind of difficult to use seamlessly with natural writing - though perhaps, I don't know enough.  My main gripes are that:   \n **1)** You have to break out of prose to do a / command for continuing the story - and it, *afaik,* doesn't do a very good job of reading previous text for context, and you have to write a blurb telling it what you want to do. With Sudowrite and Novelai, it's a keypress and it picks up where you left off seamlessly, letting you tweak from there.   \n**2)** You can generate one thing, with one model, at a time. One of my favorite things about Sudowrite is parallel generating *2 or more cards*. Plus, since fiddling with length is unintuitive in NC, you often end up with a long generation that veers off course in the middle, and you have to repeat **1)** again in the middle of your passage. \n\nSudowrite's biggest downside is that it's less flexible and customizable, and far more expensive per generation than Novelcrafter. \n\nI *want* to like Novelcrafter, but using it right now feels hard and unrewarding - writing the same thing in Sudowrite or Nai, I get much farther much faster than with Novelcrafter. \n\nPlease, do sell me on novelcrafter - I'd love to see it dethrone the others at that price point, but as it stands, I'm torn between NovelAi and Sudowrite.\n\n### Comment ID l6abrbj with +1 score by [(Dude_Man_Bro_Sir, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/l6abrbj/) (in reply to ID l6a4j3l):\nThank you for the detailed write up. I've alternated between NAI and NC since I posted this so I have some thoughts about the two tools.\n\nI agree with your points about NAI and NC.\n\nI like the way NAI produces output and is very fluid/natural with my own writing. NC, on the other hand, also provides chatbot functionality with the same models I picked for story generation (only the two models too) but the story generation is kind of clunky and needs instructions to produce content.\n\nConversely, I like NC's lore book, planning, and shelving system more than NAI's. NC allows you to create a series so you can group together different stories (or books) that occur in the same series. It can be entirely different stories or it can be a sequence of stories.\n\nWhile NAI does have a shelving system that also groups stories together, NC's system has the added benefit of making it so a lore entry can be book-level or series-level. So, you don't necessarily have to remake a lore entry if you make a new story with the same characters or in the same setting as the previous one. Unfortunately, NAI doesn't have that and you need to export it from the previous story and import it into the new story.\n\nNC also offers a more robust story planning system, where you can create a story outline with separate acts, chapters, and scenes. It has the benefit of making it easy to traverse your story if you need to go back to a different chapter or jump to the current one to continue typing.\n\nNAI puts it all into one document so if you want to separate the story into chapters, you can either create a new story in the shelf (and import the lore book) or separate the document into different chapters with \"Chapter 1\", etc, and then using CTRL + F to jump between chapters.\n\nI can't really say to use one over the other at this stage since both NC and NAI have their pros and cons still.\n\n#### Comment ID l6ahld7 with +3 score by [(waker1771, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/l6ahld7/) (in reply to ID l6abrbj):\nI think that NC is probably more useful for heavy outliners and those with a large-scale work in mind. It offers a lot more horsepower in that regard for sure. \n\nI'd be curious to hear your take on Sudowrite - I had hoped for a super clear-cut winner (don't we all?) in all this, so I could subscribe to one service alone without headache.   \n  \nUnfortunately, just like a lot of things, there's all sorts of pros and cons to weigh. \n\nI'd say my final breakdown looks something like this:   \n  \n**Sudowrite** is best in class for high-volume, quality output with minimal tweaking, and a useful, very intuitive writing toolset. But, you lose fine model control, some flexibility, and it's more costly. So if you want to fully realize an idea fully the fastest, and/or get more AI assistance, it's a winner.\n\n**Novelcrafter** gives very robust planning, lore, and outline tools, chat functions, and unmatched model availability for a low cost, but you lose that speedy workflow and high, multi-generation output. If you want to write a full-length novel in a large, cohesive universe, albeit with slightly less AI assistance, it's a great fit. \n\n**NovelAI** is a great all-rounder and adapts to style very well. It's snappy, reliable, and flexible; with unlimited generation. But, you may need to tinker a bit more than others, and there's no matching Openrouter's model breadth. Less high-volume than Sudowrite, but more than NC. If you're looking for reliable, strong writing with a high degree of output control, look no further.   \n  \nPersonally, I think NAI is starting to fall behind SW and NC with their access to newer, cutting edge LLM models, since NAI develops their own. For pros, NAI really manages to avoid the common AI phrasing and repetition pitfalls, feels more authentic and original, and is better at adapting to author style. As a con, though, it is a bit slower to adapt when there's large leaps made.\n\n## Comment ID kpg4kt6 with +2 score by [(shotofbrandy77, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/kpg4kt6/) (in reply to ID 1akj00y):\nI'm enjoying novelcrafter along with the use of open ai.

I had one killing off toddlers at a birthday party. I've tested with even their \"censored\" models - Anthropic and OpenAI - and those will work as long as there is no sexual content. The thing you will have to watch is wording in other boxes that could cause potential issues.\n\nFor example, I write dark mafia romance. Let's say in my genre box I have something with drugs or alcohol to indicate the boss's business, and I have something about writing graphic sexual details in my style box because I will have intimate scenes. Normally, you want to keep these up-to-date with the chapter or scene you are writing, but pretend I forgot to change those things. Now I'm going to write a scene involving a character's minor child, that could trigger because I've mentioned those things (drugs, alcohol, or sexual descriptions) for how the prose should be written. Take that wording out, and it's good to go. \n\nI have two series that involve human trafficking and one with minors. As long as I'm only talking about them being taken or hurt (not sexually), it will generate. If I need to generate the harsher aspect, I need to change the ages of the minors for that scene.\n\n\n\n### Comment ID k20s62o with +1 score by [(Thewrightrae_5591, Reddit, 2023-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/k20s62o/) (in reply to ID jbeiceb):\nI subscribed to Sudowrite last week.

There isn't any law in the US concerning explicit sex or any fictional depiction of violence or sex. That said, just because you write it doesn't mean anyone will read it. Major books, including the bible, feature incest, rape, and child brides. There is zero reason why software in the US should censor the written word. This is being done to prevent some lawsuit against the company, but don't quote the censorship as needing to comply with the law. There are some obscenity laws in certain states, but these only become an issue when an offensive work is widely commercialized. Some erotica and kink writers write for very small closed-loop audiences (PERFECTLY LEGAL). \"Distasteful\" doesn't constitute a violation of the law.\n\n## Comment ID kzsleep with +1 score by [(juken7, Reddit, 2024-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/kzsleep/) (in reply to ID 11lthuu):\nThanks for the info was about try the service even tho it's really expensive but know that I know will look for a better censor free A.I editor...\n\n## Comment ID lkjd9tb with +1 score by [(Entire-Adeptness9407, Reddit, 2024-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/lkjd9tb/) (in reply to ID 11lthuu):\nOk so I got similar issue first time it happened was when Warcraft was mentioned in the story, second time was when a woman threatened to cut someone's balls off, I have mostly steered away from violence and this wasn't really violence, just a threat\n\n## Comment ID lkjrwnr with +1 score by [(Entire-Adeptness9407, Reddit, 2024-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/lkjrwnr/) (in reply to ID 11lthuu):\nOk I started using Sudowrite, because it promoted itself for being uncensored, but lately it hasn't been the case\n\n## Comment ID lyf0hrn with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-11-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/lyf0hrn/) (in reply to ID 11lthuu):\nWith sudo wrote you need to be crystal clear bc it follows this algorithm, girl=below 18 yrs old, female adult or 28 yr old female adult,l=adult, and thr like yes despite the cage being given as 28 yr old girl  the term girl indicates below puberty as that is how the algorithm of these writing software work, I krefer using hyperwrite for safety uses bur if you want unfiltered and unadulterated content yiu may have to use Toolbaz instead make sure thst your ad blocker is off but thr max word count is 300 words so you may have to rely on your own mind and all unfortunately reas books how to wrote stories buy them from Amazon so yiu have a way to understand what and how to write I Blame grade school for getting rid of the graduation writing test requirements bc you are given a topic sentence and then have to wrote 3-5page essay using sole sentence have the sentence in every paragraph of the essay, the 3-5 pages is front and back of one page equals one page then you may been able to write better stories and all.\n\n## Comment ID jbe5u8w with +1 score by [(some_user_name_1109, Reddit, 2023-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/jbe5u8w/) (in reply to ID 11lthuu):\nYour fault\n\n## Comment ID jdforhb with +1 score by [(Rekard_Volfey, Reddit, 2023-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/jdforhb/) (in reply to ID 11lthuu):\nSudowrite wrote some erotica for me.

He couldn't help but feel a stirring in his loins as he took in her long legs and curves. She turned around to face him, a sultry grin on her lips as she slowly unbuttoned her blouse, revealing the lacy black bra underneath.  Stinson stepped closer, his hands reaching for her waist as he pulled her in for a deep, passionate kiss. Their tongues danced together in a fiery tango as they both moaned in pleasure. Doc's hands trailed down Stinson's chest, feeling his hard muscles underneath his shirt.  Without breaking the kiss, Stinson lifted Doc up and carried her to the bed, laying her down on the soft sheets. He pulled off her blouse and bra, revealing her beautiful breasts. He took one in his mouth, licking and **sucking on her nipple** while she moaned in ecstasy.  Doc arched her back, pressing her body against his as she reached down to unbuckle his belt. She could feel his hardness pressing against her thigh, and she wanted nothing more than to **feel him inside her.**  Stinson flipped her over onto her stomach, pulling down her pants and panties. He spread her legs apart, admiring the **wetness between them.** He teased her with his fingers, **rubbing circles around her clit before plunging two fingers deep inside her**.  Doc cried out in pleasure, her body writhing on the bed as Stinson continued to finger her. She begged for him to take her, **to fill her up with his cock**. And Stinson was more than happy to oblige.\n\n#### Comment ID jmjiqoq with +1 score by [(Ok-Sense8971, Reddit, 2023-06-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/jmjiqoq/) (in reply to ID jg8zwez):\nSudowrite wrote this?!? wow.. that's actually really good prose.

(Yes, underage sexual exploitation is absolutely repugnant. But the use of the word \"girl\" is not.) The net they cast is so big, it catches all kinds of things it shouldn't be catching, creating even more work for writers. The last thing any writer wants is software that interferes with trying to get submissions out the door.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of us can't wait for Sudowrite to get it's act together because they clearly haven't done enough (if any) testing. To do it this way, one little complaint at a time, will take forever before the software is in a more acceptable condition. We want software we can depend on, not one that's in a constant state of R&D.\n\nIn the meantime, a lot of us have deadlines and won't be sticking around to see how all this works out. I agree with the title of this thread.\n\n## Comment ID k0etloi with +1 score by [(bre2123, Reddit, 2023-09-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/k0etloi/) (in reply to ID 11lthuu):\nI feel your pain!

What was laughable about the whole thing is that I used the write feature and the AI wrote the content. I highlighted the content asked it to do a rewrite and it flagged what IT had written as a violation of the policy!!! Is that not an oxymoron?

There's several to pick from, including one that's free right now. The majority of the experimental models are unfiltered."

      "# [A neural net wrote my book. Kidding. Sort of. by leanneleeds.com on 2021-06-02](https://leanneleeds.com/artificial-intelligence-in-fiction/)\nThis FAQ has been getting missed in a big way, so I’m moving it up to the front.\n\n(Moved and updated 6-12-2024)\n\nIn June 2021, I began working with Sudowrite, an AI writing assistant for fiction writers. And by “working with,” I mean I started using the software. In July of 2022, I was featured fairly prominently in How independent writers are turning to AI – The Verge, but because they primarily used my real name (Jennifer Lepp) instead of my pen name (Leanne Leeds,) no one paid me much notice. AI use in fiction was getting far less attention than art-generating AI.\n\nAnd then ChatGPT blew that all to hell. (I did a follow-up interview on that, too though my pen name was a bit more prominently pointed out thanks to my complaint about my real name use.\n\nI didn’t think that one through.)\n\nAt this point, I’m seeing some things mentioned about me that are pretty inaccurate I felt the need to put this up. So, here we go.\n\nI read somewhere that you use AI/ChatGPT to generate all your books now.\n\nYep, I read that, too.\n\nWhen this all started, I didn’t honestly know how much of the AI-generated text I actually used because I just went with the flow and didn’t have too big a concern with keeping track. As this became a hotter and hotter topic (and I’ve seen statements from folks claiming I “generate” my books or have the AI “create” them,) I got curious, so I used PostSEO text compare to compare my finished chapter and the text that was generated by the AI in my session.\n\nThe following is a screenshot of the chapter I wrote yesterday, and this seems to be pretty average. I’ve had results as low as 8%, and as high as 11%. On average, 90% are the words from my brain, and 10% are the words from the #AI.\n\nI do not use AI for plot suggestions as some do—I know where my chapters and scenes are going, I use AI to phrase things better.\n\nWhat part of your books does ChatGPT write?\n\nNone. Almost all words in my books (the 10% above) are from Anthropic’s Claude.\n\nDo you write faster with AI? I read that you use AI to write fast.\n\nI read that, too (and said it was my goal before I read it.) Unfortunately, no. It still takes me six-seven weeks to write a book. I did not get any speed gain out of AI use because I still pretty much write the book. I just incorporate different aids to keep me moving or vary phrasings/ways to say things, Anthropic’s Claude being the predominant one.\n\nDo you teach people to use AI?\n\nI do not work for any AI company. Sudowrite did pay me to write a few blog posts sharing some of my tips and tricks while they looked for and hired a Community Leader, but I have never specifically taught any class or worked as an instructor for pay with regard to AI. My primary occupation is fiction writing, and that’s what I do for a living.\n\nYou’re a plagiarist! (Or you’re not a real writer, you’re cheating, and so on and so on)\n\nI personally don’t feel that AI companies are doing anything legally wrong, and I’m comfortable using artificial intelligence in my creative endeavors. I’m comfortable with the fact that I’m still a writer. I realize other people feel differently, and I respect that viewpoint and people’s choice not to use it or patronize people that do use it. Don’t buy my books if you hate all these things so much it makes you grind your teeth—any book that AI was used to edit has a statement to that effect in the book so readers can be informed.\n\nI am also, though, aware that this is a new frontier, and a court may decide to make some new law/update the law/re-explain the law in a way that it applies here, so I’ll be watching just like everyone else and will make changes in my own use if/when needed.\n\nTools I currently use:\n\nThis is current as of 11/10/2024.\n\nNovelCrafter – this software is exactly what I was looking for without AI. The Codex is game changing for me, the type of story bible ease I’ve been looking for. In fact, I only use the Codex, but you can use this with AI.\n\nQuillbot – to quickly rephrase sentences/as a thesaurus on a per sentence editing basis.\n\nAnthropic’s Claude – for fiction revising and rephrasing.\n\nGoogle’s NotebookLM – for querying my series.\n\nLitRPG Adventures – for fantasy locations and characters\n\nScribeShadow – Novel translations.\n\nTools I have used but no longer use:\n\nSudowrite – for fiction rewriting and work with narrative prose.\n\nPoe by Quora – Poe is a service developed by Quora and launched in December 2022. It allows access to a range of AI bots, including my two preferred LLMs: GPT-4o and Claude Opus. This cuts the access cost (ChatGPT+ at $20/m and Claude+ at $20/m) in half (Poe $20/m) and the number of messages allowed per month is more than enough for my use.\n\nChatGPT+ – for Dalle-3 and Vision. (I still use the LLM, just via API or Poe instead.)\n\nThings I wrote about the tools I’m using/was using:\n\n(Please note much of this is older information)\n\nSudowrite Tips and Tricks\n\nMy first days with Sudowrite (June 2021 – October 2021)\n\nArticles\n\n(Please note much of this is older information)\n\nNew Yorker: The Computers Are Getting Better at Writing\n\nThe Verge: The Great Fiction of AI: The strange world of high-speed semi-automated genre fiction – a long-form article that yours truly appears in.\n\nThe Verge: How Kindle novelists are using ChatGPT – an interview with me about the ChatGPT explosion\n\nAI-Generated Content and Copyright Law: What We Know (Posted Apr. 18, 2023 – this landscape is likely to change rapidly, so by the time you read this, some questions in the article may have been answered in a court case or by a regulatory body somewhere.)\n\n4 Ethical Questions Generative AI Poses\n\nThe scary truth about AI copyright is nobody knows what will happen next\n\nVideos\n\n(Please note much of this is older information)\n\nThe Creative Penn (YouTube): The AI-Augmented Author.

      "# [Sudowrite Review: Is This The Future of Writing? by Dario Villirilli on 2025-01-17](https://blog.reedsy.com/guide/book-writing-software/sudowrite/)\nAs a bit of a purist when it comes to craft, I’m always apprehensive at the thought of AI genuinely helping writers. I don’t believe anyone should use AI to write an entire novel — after all, that would defeat the creative purpose behind storytelling. But I do think that if this new technology can help authors refine their ideas and drafts into polished works, then maybe it shouldn’t be discarded.\n\nSo, I decided to take Sudowrite for a spin and find out more about this popular AI writing tool. Here’s my review.\n\nSudowrite overview and main features\n\nSudowrite is an AI-powered book-writing software for fiction writers. While there are other similar apps, such as Raptor Write and Novelcrafter, Sudowrite is arguably the most popular, as it was one of the first tools to popularize AI in fiction writing with a user-friendly interface.\n\nI tested it with Reedsy's concept novel Rocket Bride, a romantic space opera about a princess who avoids marrying an evil land developer with the help of a roguish smuggler.\n\nHere’s what the editor looks like:\n\nOverall, Sudowrite provides a range of features — from outlining to auto-writing and self-editing — that are designed to help authors overcome writer's block and “elevate their storytelling.”\n\nHere are some of the most important features:\n\nGo from story idea to first draft\n\nWhether you’re starting with a vague story idea or a fully fleshed-out concept, Story Bible helps you outline your characters, worldbuilding, synopsis, plot, and even write your first chapters based on your input. While you can generate all this information about your story with AI, it’s much better to provide as many details as possible yourself. If you let the AI handle it, you’ll end up with a rather bland story concept.\n\nWhat’s great is that you can upload a 2,000-word sample to train the Story Bible on your voice. It will analyze elements like tone, mood, POV, vocabulary, and sentence structure to tailor its suggestions to your unique writing style. For example, after analyzing our sample, it described the writing as “intimate,” “reflective,” and an “exploration of love and choice within a fantastical setting.” It also claimed that my sample has “vivid language” and “natural dialogue.”\n\nLet AI write and rewrite parts of your novel\n\nThe Write function is where the magic happens — or at least, it’s supposed to. You can paste your manuscript into Sudowrite, and whenever you’re working on a chapter and hit a creative roadblock, you can ask the tool to autocomplete it for you. Suggestions will pop up in cards on the right panel, and with just one click, you can review and insert them directly into your manuscript.\n\nSince this is the “heart of the operation,” you can customize your AI settings in depth. For example, you can choose the type of AI model you’d like to work with (e.g., Claude Opus instead of GPT-4o) and adjust the level of prose creativity and quality to suit your needs.\n\nMore importantly, you can guide the AI through the writing process rather than just letting it autocomplete your sentences. You simply type what the next few paragraphs should be about. This approach typically leads to much better results.\n\nThe Rewrite feature works similarly but focuses on reworking selected text rather than generating entirely new content.\n\nGet help in showing rather than telling\n\nAnother interesting feature is Describe, which is quite handy for authors who need help mastering the “show, don’t tell” rule. Simply highlight a sentence and click on it, and you’ll receive suggestions on how to bring your scene to life using the five senses or creative metaphors. I found this to be a valuable source of inspiration, as it can be quite difficult to look at a scene from different perspectives when you’re in the middle of writing.\n\nBrainstorm character ideas and more\n\nThe Brainstorm feature helps you generate ideas for characters, worldbuilding, dialogue, and more. Simply provide a prompt and some context, and it will give you several options to choose from. Once you select an idea, you can save it and access it later in the text editor.\n\nThat said, it doesn’t integrate with the Story Bible, meaning you’ll need to re-enter context if, for example, you want to brainstorm some character names, which can be annoying.\n\nHowever, I think the tool remains useful. For example, for our story, I quite liked the character ideas of Grax, the captain of Princess Ximara's royal guard “who is fiercely loyal to her and will stop at nothing to protect her,” and Lord Zarek, “the cunning and manipulative advisor, who often influences Aether's decisions.”\n\nVisualize your story's outline\n\nCanvas lets you visually map out your outline using one of four popular story structures: the Hero’s Journey, Save the Cat, the Three-Act Structure, or Romancing the Beat. Its flexibility allows you to use it for just about anything, like mapping character relationships. You can drag and drop elements like cards and boxes to organize your ideas however you like.\n\nPlugins\n\nFinally, Sudowrite offers some default Plugins to help you generate plot twists, create images from your story scenes, and receive feedback on your craft. The latter is perhaps the most interesting one: it praises the best part of your work and gives you some tips (or questions to ponder on) for improvement. While it’s no substitute for an actual human editor, it acts as an ever-available beta reader, which is always pretty useful.\n\nThe best part about plugins is the creativity of the writing community — anyone can create and share their own plugins for free on a dedicated page. Some plugins are designed to help you write spicy scenes, some focus on improving your opening lines, and others are made to deliver brutally honest feedback.\n\nFor example, here’s what the Brutally Honest Bot had to say about the pacing of my book’s opening: “The scene feels slow and meandering, lacking a sense of urgency or momentum. There's too much focus on Ximara's internal thoughts and emotions without enough external action to drive the scene forward.” Ouch. But also, rather helpful.\n\nThe text editor\n\nSudowrite also includes a text editor that lets you customize font, line spacing, and theme (offering various dark modes!). While it’s decent, I found it pretty basic compared to Reedsy Studio’s editor, which lets you set writing goals, collaborate with external contributors, add front and back matter, and typeset your manuscript for print. Using Sudowrite's AI features is great, but constantly exporting your work to a proper book-writing tool can interrupt the flow and make the process feel a bit clunky.\n\nSudowrite pricing\n\nBefore I share my thoughts on my overall experience with Sudowrite, let’s talk about pricing. Sudowrite uses a tiered pricing structure. Every subscription grants full access to all of its tools — the only difference between tiers is the amount of AI credits you can use. (The credits you use will depend on the complexity of each request, which is determined by the number of words used/generated and the model you select to process it.)\n\nYour choice will depend on which features you plan to use the most. If you’re primarily looking to use the Story Engine to build your outline or get some self-editing feedback, the Hobby & Student plan should be enough. However, if you intend to write substantial portions of your novel with Sudowrite, the Professional plan would be a better fit. The Max plan only makes sense if you need the additional AI credits!\n\nYou can also avoid using too many credits in Sudowrite by using Gemini, Claude, or ChatGPT on the side for some tasks (e.g., brainstorming some character or worldbuilding ideas).\n\nOne thing I appreciated is Sudowrite’s \"EZ Cancel Guarantee,\" which lets you easily upgrade, downgrade, pause, or cancel your plan. It’s quite refreshing, especially since so many tools these days seem to take the opposite approach, making cancellations frustratingly difficult.\n\nSudowrite pros and cons\n\nThere’s a lot to appreciate about Sudowrite. It combines a modern, user-friendly interface with powerful tools like the Story Bible, Write and Describe features, and all the helpful community-driven plugins. The pricing model is reasonable, catering to writers with varying levels of needs and engagement.\n\nMoreover, consider that AI technology evolves rapidly, and Sudowrite is well-positioned to improve its offerings over time. It seems to have a dedicated team that actively listens to user feedback and rolls out updates and new features.\n\nThat said, it's not all roses.\n\nThe AI suggestions aren’t flawless\n\nThe main idea behind using Sudowrite is to let the AI write parts of your novel or at least offer compelling narrative threads to help you break through creative blocks. While I was impressed with the overall quality, it’s not 100% reliable.\n\nHere’s an example from a scene it generated:\n\nContext: Ximara is reluctantly entering the room at her rehearsal dinner.\n\n“Ximara took a deep breath and stepped forward, her eyes scanning the room for Aether. She spotted him near the center, his tall frame and shock of silver hair unmistakable. As their eyes met, his face broke into a warm smile that made her heart flutter.\n\nShe began to make her way towards him, accepting greetings and well-wishes from the guests with practiced grace. The throbbing in her head intensified with each step, but she pushed through it, focusing on Aether's welcoming smile.”\n\nIt’s polished and functional, but far from final. At best, it serves as a starting point for further tweaking. (To be fair, using the guided Write option does improve the results, as well as giving it a detailed Story Bible.)\n\nThis is the most interesting aspect of AI writing: the ability to help you “look forward” in your plot. Sometimes, these ideas are genuinely exciting and can add fresh energy to your story. However, many other times the suggestions often fall back on clichés, or overly sentimental tones. Worse, they sometimes contradict the Story Bible or earlier parts of the text — whether those were written by you or the AI itself.\n\nThis means you can’t fully trust it. I’ve come to think of AI as a powerful horse — it’ll charge ahead when you ask, but no matter how many guardrails you give it, it won’t necessarily stick to the path you have in mind. You need to actively steer it to keep your story on track, and there are moments when it feels easier to just write the scenes yourself.\n\nThe features can be a bit overwhelming\n\nWhile it’s fantastic to have tools for brainstorming characters, outlining, gathering feedback, and more, there’s a downside: you can end up spending more time tinkering with features (like tweaking the content in the Story Bible) than actually writing or thinking creatively. It can feel like you’re becoming more of a prompt engineer than a writer.\n\nOne way to avoid this is by narrowing down how you use Sudowrite. (For example, I’d mostly use the Story Bible, the guided Write feature, and a few helpful plugins.)\n\nEthical considerations\n\nMany authors have expressed concerns about the ethical implications of using AI for writing novels. Sudowrite has stated that they “do not use your writing to train AI models,” which is reassuring. However, the AI suggestions are powered by a combination of models, including those from Claude and OpenAI, along with Sudowrite’s proprietary models, so it’s unclear exactly what data has been used to train these systems. It’ll be up to you to determine if you’re comfortable with using them.\n\nThe verdict: Should you use Sudowrite?\n\nSudowrite isn’t a one-stop solution for writing a novel, but it can be a very useful companion — especially if you enjoy experimenting with new technologies.\n\nIf you already have a solid grounding in storytelling and plenty of ideas but get stuck when it’s time to draft, Sudowrite can help you outline your plot. Sometimes, having a clear roadmap is all you need to finally start writing.\n\nIt can also be a game-changer for serial authors. Not every book needs to be a groundbreaking literary masterpiece, after all. If your goal is to produce a steady stream of romance or thriller stories that rely on familiar tropes while adding a touch of creativity, for example, then this tool could make you more productive.\n\nIf you are a budding author, you may also enjoy Sudowrite’s “show, don’t tell” suggestions, community plugins, and overall AI-writing features. The key is to use these to enhance your craft rather than letting them replace it.\n\nUltimately, if you’re curious about new technologies and interested in new ways of writing, then check out Sudowrite. While AI won't be able to do the creative heavy lifting for you, it might help you become more productive.",

Click “Add” on the Plugin’s card. Want to know more? Click on the card to see the Plugin’s Description page.

It’s not always clear which tool to use for a given situation. This learning curve may discourage some writers.\n\nThe Canvas System Needs an Overhaul\n\nThe Canvas feature doesn’t quite hit the mark. Its design feels disconnected from the rest of the tool. It’s easier to organize your thoughts using a Google Doc instead.\n\nUser Design Could Be More Intuitive\n\nWhile Sudowrite is powerful, its user interface could use some refinement. Some parts feel clunky and unintuitive, which can hinder your creative process. A more streamlined design would enhance the user experience.\n\nFor those seeking an AI article writer who handles more than just storytelling, consider Journalist AI.

      "# [Sudowrite Review: Is It the Best AI Tool for Writers? [2025] on 2025-02-20](https://kindlepreneur.com/sudowrite-review/)\nIn the ever-evolving world of AI and writing, there's a plethora of tools claiming to make our lives easier.\n\nOne such tool, Sudowrite, has piqued the curiosity of many writers, promising a variety of features to help craft their stories. But can it live up to the hype and truly assist authors in their creative process?\n\nWell if you’re just looking for the bottom line, I do believe that Sudowrite is the best AI tool out there for fiction writers who are just getting started with AI. It has a lot of features, but more importantly it has it's own fine-tuned model that is among the best LLMs for writing creatively.\n\nSudowrite is not perfect, so if you’d like to learn more of my thoughts on this program, continue reading.\n\nAdditionally, if you'd like to know more about how author can leverage AI, I'd invite you to check out my Story Hacker community, where we have dedicated teachers on various topics, including AI writing tools like this one.\n\nThere is a misconception at large, especially among many writers, that AI writing tools will simply do the writing for you.\n\nThis is, thankfully, not true.\n\nWe are still a long way away from being able to push a button and an AI will automatically produce a genuinely good story. I think that is unlikely to happen, at least for the next decade. And even if it happens, I still think readers will want to read books written by others, the visions of creative people.\n\nAI writing tools are intended to serve as helpful productivity assistants, not to replace human writers. They can't do all the writing for you, but they're great for tasks like brainstorming ideas, fixing typos, or suggesting better word choices.\n\nThe best way I've ever heard it described is this: AI does for writing what calculators did for math. They let us have an easy way to deal with simple calculations so we can save time and achieve results that we could never have reached otherwise.\n\nFormat Beautiful Professional Books\n\nEasy to use, and and full of amazing features, you can quickly turn your book into a professional book.\n\nCheck It Out\n\nHere’s what I love about it and what I want in a tool: AI can handle some of the basics that you might find yourself spending too much brain power on, like fixing typos, suggesting better word choices, or even generating ideas when you're stuck in a rut. This means you can focus your energy on the more important aspects of your writing, like developing characters or story development.\n\nWhat I Look For\n\nSome of the things I look for in a tool include:\n\nThe User Experience: does it easily guide you through the AI-creation process\n\nAccuracy: while not always perfect, I like to compare the actual output for every AI tool. How well does it match what I wanted it to do? Keep in mind that this often has a lot to do with the Large Language Model being used, and not the tool harnessing the LLM.\n\nPeace of Mind: As I mentioned earlier, so far AI hasn’t actually saved me a ton of time in my experimentation (that may change as I get more experience). But what a good AI tool does is free up my mental headache. Creative writing is an intense experience, and for some (myself included) it can be creatively draining. Using AI almost always leaves me feeling less drained and I end up writing more and longer as a result. This is also why AI is a really good option for those with certain disabilities and mental illnesses.\n\nSo with all that in mind, let’s dive into this review of Sudowrite. Does it satisfy my requirements and leave me with less creative drain than I would otherwise?\n\nWhat is Sudowrite?\n\nSudowrite is primarily an AI writing and editing software. And this alone is nothing big. There are tons of AI tools out there, but this is one of the few that is specifically geared for fiction authors.\n\nSudowrite has various features, from the Story Bible which helps you catalogue all of the elements of your novel (and stores them in a way in which the AI can access the data when it writes), to a bunch of brainstorming features, and a lot of other tools that let you edit the manuscript as you go.\n\nIn fact, it's kind of packed with features.\n\nOn my own personal YouTube channel (a side-project not affiliated with Kindlepreneur but posted here with permission), I did a complete walkthrough of the software and how it works. See here:\n\nIf you want more videos like this talking about the practical uses of AI in writing and marketing, be sure to subscribe to the channel.\n\nPricing: How Much Does Sudowrite Cost?\n\nSudowrite has three pricing tiers that you can purchase at a monthly rate, or annually for a slightly lesser fee.\n\n$19/month or $120/year for 225,000 Credits each month\n\n$29/month or $300/year for 1,000,000 Credits each month\n\n$129/month or $1200/year for 2,000,000 Credits each month (plus the credits rollover)\n\nCompared to a variety of other AI tools out there, this comes in roughly middle of the road. It’s not as cheap as Novelcrafter or RaptorWrite, but it’s far better for the number of words you get than a nonfiction tool like Jasper or CopyAI.\n\nKeep in mind that Sudowrite operates on a “credit” system, meaning that every time you generate words with AI, it will spend credits. Less expensive LLMs (like GPT-4o-mini) will use fewer credits, whereas larger models will use more.\n\nOf those options, I personally recommend the middle $29/month or $300/year plan. It has the best value. Although if you're a power-user of AI, the $59/month option is nice because the credits rollover.\n\nIs there a free version of Sudowrite?\n\nThere is not a permanently free version of Sudowrite, but if you use Kindlepreneur's special link, you can actually get 10,000 free AI generated words. That is plenty to try it out for yourself.\n\nTry Sudowrite Here\n\nHow to Use Sudowrite\n\nThere are a LOT of features that Sudowrite offers, so many that I’ve decided to group many of them together and talk about each in a bulleted list. Hopefully this will help you wrap your mind around the many different options Sudowrite gives you.\n\nMuse\n\nBy far the most important, flagship feature that Sudowrite offers is their Muse model, a Large Language Model (LLM) that has been specifically designed and fine-tuned for creative writing.\n\nAnd from my own experience with it, it's the best model I've ever worked with for that specific purpose.\n\nAs of this writing, the Muse model is in private beta, but will be released to the public very soon. For right now, it's been integrated into various writing features Sudowrite offers, such as the Chapter Generator, the Guided Write feature, and the Expand feature.\n\nThe Muse model has an intuitive understanding of a scene like no other AI I've worked with, including an understanding of blocking, good dialogue, witty humor, and just overall amazing prose.\n\nIt's by far, I think, the number one reason why a subscription to Sudowrite is worth it.\n\nFirst, let’s start with what most people are probably interested in: the writing tools. These are the tools that are best for longer-form writing.\n\nIn other words, if you’re hoping to use Sudowrite to actually help you write the first draft of your manuscript, this is what you want to look at.\n\nChapter Generator: This is a feature where AI can take a detailed summary of your chapter (usually in the form of 10-20 beats), and write out the whole thing. Personally, I've found this to be a bit hit or miss, and I prefer to write my chapters one 250-word section at a time or so, but it's actually quite a useful tool if you want a quick draft ready to edit.\n\nGuided and Auto Write: These two options are how you continue writing each subsequent section of your story. With Guided Write, you can add a sentence or two about what happens next, and Sudowrite will take that and generate up to 500 words (depending on your settings). Auto Write is similar, but without the guidance, meaning you can just see where it goes. Combined with the Muse model, these are my favorite ways to write.\n\nTone Shift: This is a handy feature that allows you to change the tone of your story. A pretty simple but often needed feature.\n\nExpand: Let’s say you have a paragraph that quickly covers some action, and you want to expand that moment to include more detailed descriptions, or perhaps more dialogue, etc. The Expand feature is perfect for that. It’s probably the feature I use most after Guided Write.\n\nRevision is one of those things that AI is pretty good at these days, and you can see that in action with these tools. These are the tools I will often use once I already have my manuscript in decent shape, or after importing my own manuscript from elsewhere.\n\nRewrite: The Rewrite feature is one of my favorites. It lets you rewrite any text to either Rephrase the text, make it shorter, more descriptive, to show instead of tell, add more inner conflict, or make the text more intense. I especially love using the “Show not Tell” feature, since AI often tells too much, I can easily select those passages and fix them. You can also customize your Rewrite to conform to any specific prompts you might want to give it.\n\nDescribe: I’m personally horrible at descriptions. They say you should try to use as many senses as possible when describing, but I’m barely able to get one. With Sudowrite, you can highlight a section you want to describe in more detail, and it will do so using all five senses, plus some metaphors. This is a very useful tool for expanding my descriptions.\n\nHere is one area where Sudowrite shines. They have a ton of different ways to brainstorm your novel or different elements of it.\n\nThe way each of these work is the AI will generate a list of things like names, dialogue, attributes, etc. It’s a giant list builder, and it does so in each of the following categories:\n\nDialogue\n\nCharacters\n\nWorld Building\n\nPlot Points\n\nNames\n\nPlaces\n\nObjects\n\nDescriptions\n\nArticle Ideas\n\nTweets\n\nSomething Else (a custom field where you can ask the tool to brainstorm just about anything)\n\nI’ve found these to be very useful, if only to get my creative juices flowing. I might not even use the items I’m given, but sometimes I’ll pick a piece of one, combine it with something else, and have a much better idea of what I want.\n\nOverall a great tool.\n\nPlugins\n\nPlugins were introduced a while back as a solution for a problem that Sudowrite used to have: a lack of flexibility.\n\nWhile you still can't modify Sudowrite's existing prompts, you CAN create plugins (or use those from the Sudowrite community) for pretty much whatever task you can think of.\n\nSome of these plugins are genuinely useful, and it's always interesting to see how other Sudowrite users are creatively using these tools.\n\nBeyond the writing, editing, and brainstorming, there were a few unique tools that I really loved that don’t fit in some of the other categories:\n\nVisualize: Sudowrite has some visual integrations that allow you to use AI to generate images of parts of your manuscript. All you have to do is highlight a portion of your story and click on visualization and it will add something. If you don’t use an AI Art generator like Midjourney, this can be a fun option, although I find it's mostly something fun to do, rather than a feature that has genuine value.\n\nShrink Ray: The Shrink Ray is a powerful feature. It takes everything in your current document (not the entire manuscript) and generates 2 loglines, a blurb, a synopsis, and an outline.\n\nTwist: The twist is one of my favorite features, because I’m horrible at coming up with good twists. Like the brainstorming features, this is a great one to get the juices flowing. You add a brief summary of your plot, and it gives you ideas for good plot twists you can use.\n\nPoem: This is exactly what it sounds like. You enter in your topic, and an optional number of seed lines, and it does the rest.\n\nThemes: Sudowrite not only has a dark mode, but has several other visual themes that you can use. I personally prefer Aurora Borealis.\n\nCanvas: A sort of virtual cork board where you can store all your notes.\n\nStory Bible\n\nThe Story Bible is a special area of Sudowrite's dashboard that lets you input information about your characters, worldbuilding, etc. This means that the AI, when writing your book, has access to that information, so it can write your characters/setting appropriately. The Story Bible includes sections for the following:\n\nBraindump: A place where you can input everything you know about your story to start with (which can be used to help generate characters, synopsis, etc.)\n\nGenre: Where you can tell the AI what genre you're writing.\n\nStyle: Where you can give the AI specific style instruction, and even have it analyze your writing to try and emulate that style.\n\nSynopsis: A summary of the story in a couple of paragraphs.\n\nCharacters: A list of all the major characters for the story. You can even add specific information like dialogue style, all of which is useful for the AI to write them.\n\nWorldbuilding: A list of all major worldbuilding elements, with a lot of variety in what you can input.\n\nOutline: A place to generate or manually write your outlines. It even comes with a number of outline templates that you can run with.\n\nOverall, I find myself using the Story Bible quite extensively when I'm writing with Sudowrite.\n\nPros: What I Liked About Sudowrite\n\nSo now that we’ve discussed all the features, let’s talk about the ones I really like, and that make this program stand out to me.\n\nMuse: This is my favorite feature, and saves the most time for me. I believe it's the best Large Language Model for creative writing yet invented (as of this writing), and will only get better.\n\nThe expand feature: Another great feature that, next to Guided Write, is one of the best ways to get new words down that you can then edit.\n\nBrainstorming features: There’s so much here that I can’t really say I will ever have problems coming up with ideas again.\n\nThe outlining feature: I love this. There is something incredibly satisfying at entering your story treatment, and getting a genuinely good outline in return. I’ll be using AI to aid my outlines for the foreseeable future.\n\nRewrite: Rewrite is a game-changer, especially some of the different options like the “show don’t tell” rewrite feature. Since many authors struggle with this (and AI does too, honestly), having a way to directly target passages that are telling too much is a huge headache-saver.\n\nTwist feature: Like the outline tool, sometimes it helps to have a way to brainstorm twists in the plot. This feature has produced a number of genuinely good twists that I was able to use or adapt to my book.\n\nOverall clean design: Sudowrite is one of the better AI tools when it comes to simplicity. It's like they're trying to be the Apple of AI tools.\n\nCons: What I Didn’t Like About Sudowrite\n\nDespite the many good things that Sudowrite has going for it. There are a few things that I would like to see improved.\n\nThe Pricing Structure: I'm not a huge fan of the credit system, especially because it can be easy to run out of credits really fast if you are using one of the beefier models.\n\nNo API Integration: Other tools will usually let you hook up a third-party tool like OpenRouter, to get the AI words in that way (which is usually cheaper). The lack of this feature means the AI words are generally more expensive, and you can't automatically use brand new models to test for yourself. You have to wait for Sudowrite to add them.\n\nCanvas needs more structure: As it currently stands, I found Canvas to be more overwhelming than helpful. There’s no structure to help you list your characters, worldbuilding, etc. I think it would be better to have some kind of Story Bible feature where you can create various entries of each one. But that might just be my style. The outlining portion is great, but doesn’t seem to fit the Canvas setting well.\n\nThe good news is, the Sudowrite team is very responsive to critiques and is constantly putting out new features.\n\nIn fact, there was one that I asked for (being able to have 1 card generated instead of 2-6) that had already been added by the time I started writing the first draft of this review.\n\nBest Book Marketing Software\n\nOver 47,000+ authors, NYT bestsellers, and publishing companies use Publisher Rocket to gain key insight to the market. Help your book now\n\nGet Rocket Now\n\nThe Bottom Line: Is Sudowrite Worth It?\n\nSudowrite is, in my experience, one of the best AI tools for fiction authors on the market. Especially if you want a tool that is simple and easy to use.\n\nIt’s certainly not the only tool out there that fiction authors can use. ChatGPT, Novelcrafter, RaptorWrite, Claude and the OpenAI Playground can all be used in this way. But these tools usually require a better understanding of prompt engineering and how AI works.\n\nSudowrite, on the other hand, will hold your hand through the entire process.\n\nOverall, I think its massive collection of features, combined with a select few like the Muse model, make it well-positioned as a fantastic fiction writing program.\n\nTry Sudowrite Here",
      "# [I tried Sudowrite to overcome writer’s block — and I finally finished my novel by Amanda Caswell on 2024-09-04](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/i-tried-sudowrite-to-overcome-writer-s-block-and-i-finally-finished-my-novel)\nWhen I first heard about Sudowrite, I was intrigued but skeptical. The AI writing platform uses over two dozen AI models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude 2 by Anthropic, multiple open models, and transformer models created by OpenAI.\n\nThe result? Your writing gets a human-like narrative that's impressively good. After diving in, I can confidently say it has exceeded my expectations in many ways.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at how Sudowrite helps bring stories to life.\n\nMy first impressions\n\nUpon opening Sudowrite, I was greeted with a clean and intuitive interface, which meant I didn't have to spend hours figuring out how to use it. After watching a quick video, within minutes, I was ready to explore its three main modes: Describe, Brainstorm, and Rewrite.\n\nStarting a new project in Sudowrite is straightforward. I recommend enabling the Story Bible feature, where you can input all the details about your novel, including your outline, synopsis, and characters.\n\nOne of my favorite features is style. Simply input a sample paragraph, and AI will analyze and match your writing style. I included a paragraph of my own writing and even added that I wanted a structure similar to that of Beverly Cleary. Surprise – Sudowrite delivered!\n\nHow Sudowrite helps you write\n\nThe Describe Mode is where Sudowrite truly shines. I often struggle to paint vivid pictures with my words, but this mode changed the game for me.\n\nBy inputting a few keywords or a simple sentence, Sudowrite generated detailed descriptions that added depth and richness to my writing. It felt like having a personal creative assistant who could effortlessly expand on my ideas.\n\nNext, I tried the Brainstorm Mode. As someone who occasionally hits creative roadblocks, this feature was a lifesaver.\n\nI fed it a basic concept, and Sudowrite presented me with a plethora of directions to take my story, which I then turned into beats for each chapter.\n\nIt was like having a brainstorming session with a highly imaginative friend who never runs out of ideas.\n\nOther features\n\nIn less than a minute, AI weaves together your beats to seamlessly generate a chapter. Be sure to keep the application open. Switching tabs might cause glitches. Once the chapter is created, you can go in and make any necessary edits or move on to the next chapter.\n\nSudowrite offers fun plugins to keep you motivated. Some of my favorites are the Simulated New Yorker Review, Encouraging Writing Buddy, Brainstorm, and Feedback. If you’re a glutton for punishment, you might enjoy the Hyper Critical Writing Buddy and Brutal Honesty Bot (personally, I avoid those at all costs).\n\nFinally, the Rewrite Mode helped me refine my drafts. It suggested alternative phrasings and sentence structures, making my writing flow better and read more smoothly. This mode is perfect for those final touches before hitting ‘publish’ or submitting a manuscript.\n\nPerformance and pricing\n\nNow, let’s talk about the elephant in the room: pricing. Sudowrite’s subscription plans are on the higher side, which might be a dealbreaker for some. However, considering the productivity boost and creative inspiration it provided me, I found it worth the investment.\n\nIf you’re serious about writing and can afford it, Sudowrite is a valuable tool. You can give it a test drive for free, but if you’re serious about your writing, subscriptions start at $10/month. Trust me, it’s worth it.\n\nWhile Sudowrite impressed me overall, it wasn’t without flaws. I’ve had it change a character’s name mid-story and transform another’s curly hair into a spiky hairdo for no reason. The AI generated content was generally coherent and contextually appropriate, but there were moments when the output felt a bit off. These instances required some manual tweaking, reminding me that AI still can’t completely replace the human touch.\n\nOne of the unexpected perks of Sudowrite is its strong community. The developers actively engage with users, regularly updating the platform based on feedback. Customer support is also top-notch, ensuring that any issues or questions are promptly addressed.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nSudowrite has genuinely transformed my approach to writing. Six months ago, if you had told me I’d complete not one, but two YA science fiction novels, I would have laughed.\n\nIf you’d told me one of those novels would hit #1 on Amazon for a week, I’d have begged for the secret.\n\nSudowrite isn’t just a tool; it’s a creative companion that can help unlock your writing potential. Give it a try, and you might just find yourself finally writing that novel.\n\nMore from Tom's Guide",

      "# [Sudowrite Review: Can AI Write a Novel That Sounds Human? by Janine Heinrichs on 2023-12-18](https://www.unite.ai/sudowrite-review/)\nThe idea of artificial intelligence writing entire novels may sound like fiction, but Sudowrite offers practical AI tools to help authors through the whole book writing process. With the rising prevalence of AI, you can write an entire novel in a week. But the question is, will it sound human?\n\nIn this Sudowrite review, I will explain what Sudowrite is and who it's best for. From there, I'll show you how to get started on their free plan that grants you 50,000 credits, followed by an in-depth guide on using Sudowrite's primary tools. I share my entire writing process, from brainstorming to writing to editing a mystery novel with Sudowrite that you won't want to miss!\n\nFrom there, I'll share my honest thoughts on what I liked and disliked about Sudowrite, followed by the top three Sudowrite alternatives I've tried. My goal with this article is to provide you with the most comprehensive, behind-the-scenes look at how I've used it to write a mystery novel from scratch.\n\nSo, can Sudowrite AI help writers bring their stories to life in a way that feels human? Let's find out!\n\nWhat is Sudowrite?\n\nFounded by Amit Gupta and James Yu, Sudowrite is an AI-powered writing tool designed to assist human writers in their creative process.

They do this with font and theme customization, full-screen mode for focus, and chapter organization. They even have a Google Chrome extension for using Sudowrite in Google Docs!\n\nSudowrite AI avoids plagiarism by harnessing the power of ChatGPT-3 and 4, along with Transformer models containing an impressive 175 billion parameters.

Let's look at who benefits the most from using it!\n\nWho Should Use Sudowrite?\n\nAnyone interested in creative writing should use Sudowrite, even just for fun. Trust me, it's worth it. However, there are a few types of people Sudowrite AI is most suitable:\n\nFiction Writers: Sudowrite is most suited for writers struggling with writer's block as it offers all the tools you need to write a novel or short story. Use the Brainstorm tool to generate ideas to build worlds and characters and develop an outline using AI with Canvas. Add that outline to the Story Bible to get AI to write your entire novel one chapter at a time.\n\nStudents: Sudowrite is an invaluable resource for students, especially those studying literature or creative writing. Whether you need help writing essays, analyzing literature, or crafting compelling stories for assignments, Sudowrite's AI writing assistant can be your go-to tool. It provides guidance and suggestions and even helps you refine your writing style.\n\nBloggers: For bloggers looking to create engaging content, use Sudowrite to generate fresh ideas, craft compelling headlines, and structure your blog posts.

Plus, it generates attention-grabbing headlines and enables you to develop effective calls to action to capture leads and make sales.\n\nCopywriters: Copywriters can use Sudowrite AI to enhance their writing for product descriptions, website content, and promotional materials. Use Sudowrite to generate creative ideas for advertising campaigns with the Brainstorm tool. Use sensory language with the Describe tool to make your copy more captivating for your target audience.\n\nPoets/Songwriters: Sudowrite can help poets and songwriters explore new ideas with the Brainstorm, refine their lyrical expression with Rewrite and Describe, and ultimately overcome any creative blocks they may encounter. It has a dedicated “Poem” tool that generates a contemporary free verse poem in seconds!\n\nGetting Started with Sudowrite\n\nI started by going to the Sudowrite homepage, scrolling down, and selecting “Try Sudowrite for Free” in the bottom right corner.\n\nSudowrite is free forever (no credit card required) with a generous starting balance of 50,000 credits. Once those credits are consumed, plans start at $10 per month, making Sudowrite affordable for writers of all levels.\n\nOnce I signed up, Sudowrite gave me a quick demo of how to write and describe using AI. I found the demo helpful, giving me more confidence in using Sudowrite as my AI writer.\n\nAfter the demo, I was taken to an untitled Sudowrite project where I could start writing. The user interface was clean and intuitive, making navigating the various features and tools Sudowrite offers easy.\n\nLet's get into a brief explanation of the Sudowrite tools and how to use them.\n\nSudowrite Tools\n\nSudowrite offers a range of tools that writers can use to enhance their writing process, which can be divided into three categories:\n\nBrainstorming Tools\n\nWriting Tools\n\nEditing Tools\n\nWe'll explore the main tools that come with Sudowrite, and I will show you how I used these tools to begin writing a novel!\n\n1. Brainstorming Tools\n\nWhether you're writing fiction, blog posts, or any other creative content, these brainstorming tools provide practical help, enabling you to generate unique and captivating storylines:\n\nBrainstorm: “Brainstorm” is a giant list builder that generates the perfect name or title. It's like having a reliable and endless source of ideas. Give a thumbs up to your favorite ideas, which will provide you with even better ones.\n\nCanvas: “Canvas” allows you to create an outline containing a summary of your story, character secrets, and plot twists. It's a convenient space to store all your inspiration and references in one location.\n\nVisualize: “Visualize” enhances your character sheets and world-building documents by turning your descriptions into captivating artwork.\n\nHow I Used Sudowrite's Brainstorm Tools\n\nHere's how I used Sudowrite's brainstorming tools to get ideas for a story to write using Sudowrite.\n\nBrainstorm\n\nIn my Sudowrite project, I selected “Brainstorm” at the top.\n\nI was asked what I wanted to brainstorm, ranging from dialogues, names, characters, places, and more! I selected “Something Else” to generate my novel title.\n\nFor Sudowrite to give me a list of potential titles for my novel, I had to tell it what to provide me with (in my case, “Novel titles.”)\n\nOptionally, I could give Sudowrite some context and title examples. I didn't have any examples, so I left that blank. However, I did have some context of the novel I was planning on writing, so I placed that in the “Context” field.\n\nFrom there, I hit “Start” to see what novel title ideas Sudowrite would generate.\n\nInstantly, Sudowrite gave me a list of engaging novel titles! All of the ideas were good, but there was one that I particularly liked: “Three Minutes Ahead: A Detective LaBlanche Mystery.”\n\nI gave it a thumbs up to add it to my “Keepers” list, and that title was immediately replaced with another excellent title. If I didn't like the title, I could give it a thumbs down to be instantly replaced with a new title.\n\nWhether I selected the thumbs up or down, each idea was replaced with a new one. The Sudowrite brainstorm feature is a never-ending source of creative inspiration!\n\nAfter saving my list and exiting, I returned to my Sudowrite project. Sudowrite AI added my Brainstorm list to the History panel on the right, where I could easily insert, copy, open, or favorite it anytime!\n\nSudowrite's brainstorming tool is invaluable for any writer looking to generate fresh ideas like dialogues, names, characters, places, or plot points. With a few clicks, you can unlock a wealth of creativity to fuel your storytelling!\n\nCanvas\n\nWithin my Sudowrite project, I selected “Canvas” on the bottom left.\n\nI was greeted with a large canvas with character cards, images, and an outline! Sudowrite did an excellent job clearly explaining how to use the canvas, which can initially feel overwhelming.\n\nI could start from scratch with blank cards, labels, and outlines by adding them to the bottom of the canvas. Alternatively, I could build characters and a storyline with what was already filled out. I went with the latter.\n\nI started by hovering my mouse over the character cards and selecting the “+” icon to get Sudowrite to generate more character descriptions for me.\n\nSudowrite did an excellent job! This is a great way to add more depth to my characters.\n\nVisualize\n\nI could also select “Visualize” to get Sudowrite to generate an image of the character in seconds based on the description.\n\nThe image looks excellent and fits the description perfectly! This feature brought my characters to life and helped me visualize them in my story.\n\nOn the right was the entire outline for my story. I selected “Generate full outline,” and the whole thing was populated a few seconds later. It was like having a personal writing assistant right at my fingertips.\n\nNext, I selected one of the cards in my outline and clicked “Generate options for this card” to see variations of this part of the story.\n\nSudowrite always generates three variations at a time. Here's one of them:\n\nSudowrite did a fantastic job developing options for this card. The text appears as though it was written by a person, offering me a new viewpoint on how the scene could unfold and enhancing the depth of my overall storyline.\n\nThe Sudowrite canvas is a powerful tool for writers, especially those who may feel overwhelmed by starting from scratch. From generating character descriptions and visuals to creating an entire outline in seconds, Sudowrite is the perfect tool to enhance your storytelling.\n\n2. Writing Tools\n\nUse these writing tools to overcome writer’s block, refine your writing style, and write engaging content:\n\nWrite: “Write” analyzes the traits of your characters, the tone of your writing, and the progression of your plot. From there, it generates 300 words in your unique tone of voice. It also gives you different variations to choose from!\n\nDescribe: Sudowrite's “Describe” tool lets you highlight and describe specific things in your story to facilitate a strong connection between your readers and your characters. This helps your readers feel fully immersed in the story.\n\nExpand: “Expand” enhances the pacing of your story so it isn't too fast, maintaining an ideal pace that prevents readers from being disconnected.\n\nStory Bible (Story Engine): The “Story Bible” feature guides you through each stage of the fiction writing process, from your initial idea to creating an outline, developing chapters, and ultimately generating thousands of words in your unique writing style. You can write an entire novel within a week!\n\nHow I Used Sudowrite to Start Writing a Novel\n\nHere's how I used Sudowrite to begin writing my novel.\n\nWrite\n\nTo begin writing my novel with Sudowrite, I had to write at least 20 words (Sudowrite needs some context to work its magic). After doing so, I placed my cursor at the end of it and clicked on the “Write” button, and Sudowrite sprung into action.\n\nIt's important to note that the dropdown arrow next to the “Write” button offers different writing modes: Auto, Guided (give Sudowrite instructions), and Tone Shift (change your writing style). I could also access my writing settings. In my case, I stuck with the default Auto write but feel free to experiment!\n\nInstantly, Sudowrite continued the story by populating the right panel with some options to continue the story. I skimmed through them and inserted the one I liked most by selecting the “Insert” button. Once inserted, the text turned purple, indicating that Sudowrite had written it and needed editing.\n\nI was thoroughly impressed with what Sudowrite had come up with. The options Sudowrite gave me were well-crafted and perfectly aligned with the tone and style I had in mind for my novel.\n\nThe text also hooks the reader instantly, intriguing them to delve deeper into the story. Sudowrite's ability to capture the essence of my characters and maintain the progression of the plot was remarkable!\n\nDescribe\n\nAfter making a few tweaks (Sudowrite had gotten the pronouns of my detective protagonist wrong), I wanted to explore the “Describe” feature. In my case, the silhouette is something of interest to the reader. I highlighted this word within the document and hit “Describe.”\n\nSudowrite generated descriptions of the Silhouette in the right panel using different senses and metaphors. The options were vivid and imaginative, painting a detailed picture of the silhouette! In my case, the description based on “Sight” made the most sense, so that's the one I inserted into the document.\n\nExpand\n\nAnother tool I loved in Sudowrite is the “Expand” tool, where I could highlight one or multiple sentences and continue the story at an ideal pace. I highlighted the two sentences I had just inserted describing the silhouette and selected “Expand.”\n\nHere is how Sudowrite continued my story after expanding it:\n\nI'm genuinely impressed with the quality of writing. Sudowrite did an excellent job continuing my story and establishing a high level of engagement with optimal pacing!\n\nStory Bible\n\nLast but not least is the Story Bible. This is perfect for people who don't want to start with a blank document, as it will write a first draft of every chapter for you! Crazy, right?\n\nI accessed Story Bible by turning on the “Story Bible” toggle in the bottom left of my document.\n\nFrom there, I began filling out the fields:\n\nBraindump: Write anything and everything you know about your story.\n\nGenre: Identify the genres you are writing in.\n\nStyle: Describe how the story will be written (I highly recommend using “Match my style…” to paste up to 2,000 words of your writing and have Sudowrite describe it).\n\nSynopsis: Present the characters, their goals, and the primary source of conflict while effectively capturing the tone, themes, and distinctive aspects of the story (select “Generate Synopsis” to get Sudowrite to fill this out for you).\n\nCharacters: Describe everything there is to know about the characters, including physical appearance, mannerisms, relationships, and goals (I highly recommend selecting “Generate Characters” to get Sudowrite to generate this for you).\n\nOutline: Write your outline or choose from one of five outlines provided by Sudowrite.\n\nI was thoroughly impressed with how accurately Sudowrite matched my style, generated a synopsis, and more. It made the entire process of writing my story so much easier and enjoyable.\n\nOnce complete, Sudowrite began adding chapters to my document that I could start generating by following the steps. I selected “Generate Beats” (“beats” being the main elements of the chapter), and Sudowrite did an excellent job of giving an overview of the chapter.\n\nThe second step was generating the chapter. I liked that I could choose the speed, accuracy, and more by selecting the down arrow next to the “Generate Chapter” button. This helped me tailor the output to my preferences by giving me the choice of prioritizing speed, accuracy, etc.\n\nSudowrite began writing out the story beats; I could walk away and let Sudowrite write my entire novel. It took a couple of minutes to generate (mind you, this is a whole book chapter!), but the quality of writing was worth the wait. From there, I moved on to the next chapter.\n\nEach beat was concise yet captivating, providing a clear roadmap for the chapter's progression. Sudowrite effortlessly captured the tone and themes of my story, infusing it with the same style and voice that I had established.\n\nSudowrite's Story Bible feature is an absolute game-changer for authors with writer's block who want to pump out an entire novel in a week. Within minutes, I could generate whole chapters of a book; all I had to do was edit it. It truly works like magic!\n\nMake sure you take advantage of the Story Bible resources:\n\nStory Bible Guide\n\nSudowrite Classes\n\n3. Editing Tools\n\nSudowrite’s revision tools offer practical help in revision, better word choice, and story enhancement:\n\nRewrite: Get “Rewrite” to revise your writing without doing it 100 times manually. It's incredibly adaptable, unfailingly persistent, and always open to feedback.\n\nThesaurus: Sudowrite includes an integrated “Thesaurus” where you can highlight a word and instantly generate alternative words with similar meanings.\n\nHow I Used Sudowrite to Edit a Novel\n\nHere's how I used Sudowrite to edit my novel.\n\nRewrite\n\nIf I needed to make some revisions, Sudowrite's Rewrite tool was invaluable. It allowed me to revise my writing quickly without countless manual edits. To use it, I only highlighted the sentence or sentences I wanted to rewrite and hit the “Rewrite” button.\n\nIn the right panel, I could choose how I wanted Sudowrite to rewrite my sentences, whether rephrasing them or making them shorter, more descriptive, adding inner conflict, and more. I could even give it a custom request with the “Customize” option! I went with “Rephrase” and hit “Go.”\n\nSudowrite generated two variations of the original sentence. The sentence was excellently rewritten, maintaining the meaning and providing a new perspective with more description.\n\nThesaurus\n\nSudowrite's “Thesaurus” tool (it doesn't seem to have a name; I'm just calling it that) gave me different synonyms to replace words that I felt would be better. I highlighted “billowed” in my document, and Sudowrite suggested a few synonyms.\n\nSelecting the “more…” option took me to a “word cloud” page where I could select the word I wanted to use. I chose “fluttered” and could generate more like that word or copy it to insert it into my text.\n\nAnd there you have it! My entire process of writing a novel using Sudowrite's primary brainstorming, writing, and editing tools.\n\nI was amazed by the caliber of writing Sudowrite generates and how efficient the process was, particularly with the help of Story Bible. I'm convinced anyone at any skill level can produce an entire novel within a week!\n\nWhat I Liked About Sudowrite\n\nUp to 50,000 credits on the permanently free version of Sudowrite, suitable for writers on any budget.\n\nThe interface is easy to navigate, and the tools are fun.\n\nSudowrite generates excellent results that sound human, making it a valuable tool for beginner writers.\n\nSave significant time using AI to streamline your creative process (Story Bible can write an entire novel within a week!)\n\nTools for each stage of the creative writing process, from brainstorming to writing to editing.\n\nUse AI to turn descriptions into artwork instantly for better visualization.\n\nThe content is written accurately in your unique tone of voice.\n\nKeep readers engaged by using AI to describe things in your story more deeply and expand text for optimal pacing.\n\nGet Sudowrite to rewrite up to six variations simultaneously rather than doing this manually.\n\nHighlight individual words and select better synonyms Sudowrite suggests.\n\nChapters are organized neatly within projects.\n\nWrites in almost any language; does not plagiarize.\n\nSudowrite Google Chrome Extension for those who want to use Sudowrite in Google Docs.\n\nSudowrite Discord community if you have questions or want to connect with like-minded AI writers.\n\nSudowrite Manual on how to use Sudowrite.\n\nWhat I Disliked About Sudowrite\n\nSudowrite may get aspects of the story wrong, such as pronouns or characters.\n\nA lot of features may feel overwhelming for some users.\n\nThe canvas feature was useful but felt clunky.\n\nTop 3 Sudowrite Alternatives I've Tried\n\nIn this section, I will compare Sudowrite to other AI story generators I've used to help you decide which tool best suits your writing needs.\n\nJasper AI\n\nJasper AI is among the best AI writing assistants on the market. Give it a text prompt, and it will generate creative and engaging content in your unique tone of voice. You can write an entire story or a 1,500-word article in seconds!\n\nOne of the most significant differences between the platforms is the target demographics. Jasper AI is designed more for marketing teams and businesses to maintain a consistent brand voice while collaborating on generating compelling content across multiple channels. There's a feature for creating brand voices and campaigns, which Sudowrite does not have.\n\nMeanwhile, Sudowrite is more geared towards creative writers who want to rekindle their passion for writing and overcome writer's block. Tools like the Canvas for describing characters and creating outlines and the Story Bible that generates an entire novel chapter by chapter make it clear that Sudowrite focuses on providing a creative writing experience.\n\nWhile both tools benefit marketers and creative writers, choose Jasper for more robust marketing and business tools for your team to collaborate. If you are a creative writer, like an author or poet, choose Sudowrite.\n\nWe also Compare Jasper Vs. Copy AI & Jasper Vs. Scalenut.\n\nRead our Jasper Review or visit Jasper.\n\nWritesonic\n\nWritesonic is another powerful writing tool that uses AI technology to create high-quality content. With Writesonic, you can generate blog posts, social media captions, and generate entire stories with just a few clicks.\n\nWhat sets Writesonic apart from Sudowrite is its ability to cater to a wide range of writing needs. Whether you're a content marketer looking for catchy headlines or a startup founder needing persuasive copy for your landing page, Writesonic has what you need.\n\nThe platform offers various templates and prompts to get your creative juices flowing. You can give specific details about your topic or let Writesonic develop creative ideas for you. It is incredibly user-friendly and intuitive, making it accessible to writers of all skill levels.\n\nOne notable feature of Writesonic is its ability to generate entire stories. Whether you're in need of a short fiction piece or a longer narrative, Writesonic can provide you with a well-crafted story that captures the essence of your chosen genre.\n\nAlthough Writesonic can write stories from start to finish, it also offers tools and templates for other types of writers. Choose Writesonic if you plan on using it as a writing tool for a variety of purposes that go beyond story writing. For fictional writers who want more robust brainstorming, writing, and editing tools for their novels, choose Sudowrite!\n\nRead our Writesonic Review or visit Writesonic.\n\nPlot Factory\n\nPlot Factory is another AI-powered writing platform that allows you to collaboratively plan, organize, and write stories. Unlike Sudowrite and Jasper AI, Plot Factory focuses specifically on helping writers develop and organize their story plots. However, it still generates stories with AI.\n\nWith Plot Factory, you can create different “universes” that house stories, characters, places, objects, and more. It provides a comprehensive toolkit for structuring your story, planning scenes, and tracking the progression of your characters.\n\nWhile Sudowrite and Jasper AI provide more versatile writing assistance across various genres and styles, Plot Factory excels in organizing and planning out stories. If you're a writer who struggles with plot development or want to improve your storytelling structure and character development, Plot Factory is the perfect tool for you!\n\nSudowrite Review: Can AI Write Novels That Sound Human?\n\nAfter using Sudowrite's tools to write a novel from start to finish, Sudowrite is more than capable of writing compelling content that sounds human. Although it can't replace actual writing, I would argue that it's still better than what humans can write.\n\nFrom the start, Sudowrite matched my tone of voice and pacing while infusing words I would have never thought of to captivate readers. The AI-powered platform effortlessly weaved together intricate plotlines, compelling characters, and immersive settings. It was like having a co-author who understood and brought my creative vision to life.\n\nBesides the brainstorming tools that helped me develop unique titles, characters, and plotlines, Sudowrite wrote my entire novel without me lifting a finger. All I had to do was indicate what the story was about and the genre. I walked away from my computer, knowing Sudowrite would continue crafting my story with the same creativity and attention to detail. After that, I used Sudowrite's AI editing tools to make the final touches.\n\nI hope you found my review of Sudowrite helpful! Whether you're a beginner writer or a seasoned author, I'm confident Sudowrite will revolutionize your writing process. With its AI-powered tools and seamless integration into your creative vision, Sudowrite offers an experience like no other. Sudowrite surpassed my expectations, and I'm sure it will for you, too.\n\nSudowrite has many good things going for it in the foreseeable future you won't want to miss. Try Sudowrite for free and get 50,000 credits to start writing the next bestseller.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs Sudowrite worth the money?\n\nYes, Sudowrite is well worth the money. After signing up, you'll be granted 50,000 credits and full access to brainstorming, writing, and editing tools to start writing compelling content. For most authors, that word count is quite limited. Once those 50,000 credits have been consumed, plans start at $10 per month.

It uses advanced AI technology to generate human-like writing but does not collect or store personal information. I also did not encounter any problems related to data breaches or security vulnerabilities on my device, further confirming Sudowrite's safety.\n\nHow much is Sudowrite per month?\n\nSudowrite's free trial is free forever; no credit card is required.

      "# [Why would writers use AI? by Nicole Brinkley on 2024-11-01](https://misshelved.substack.com/p/why-would-writers-use-ai)\nIn September, National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo)—or, rather, the organization behind the month-long writing challenge—published a proclamation that nobody asked them to make. The nonprofit declared that the use of so-called “artificial intelligence” to write a novel was good and fine and dandy. They made this declaration with no asterisks, not so subtly including generative AI in their statement, despite the fact that generative AI models have been built by stealing the work of hundreds of thousands of writers.\n\nIn fact, the NaNoWriMo organizers wrote, if you had a problem with somebody using generative AI to create a novel, you were ableist. And classist. And probably racist and homophobic, too.\n\nThe statement sparked immediate repercussions for the organization in the form of resignations from its advisory board . . . and it broke containment. The New York Times and The Washington Post covered the story. Popular commentary YouTuber D’Angelo Wallace vlogged about it. Every time I logged onto social media, my feeds drowned in commentary.\n\nBut why would you want to use generative AI to complete a challenge in which the purpose is to stretch your creative limits? Wouldn’t allowing somebody else to write the book for you defeat the purpose of NaNoWriMo?\n\nWhy would a writer want to use generative AI to write a novel, anyway?\n\nLet’s all get on the same page real quick. “Artificial intelligence” is not, in fact, intelligence. What we refer to as “artificial intelligence” are models: “a program that has been trained on a set of data to recognize certain patterns or make certain decisions without further human intervention.” The creator of an artificial intelligence model feeds data into the program, which the program categorizes into numeric patterns. When users engage with the program, it responds by putting together the most likely pattern in response to the numbers it recognizes in the prompt. The stupidity of artificial intelligence goes beyond made-up information, such as the “hallucination” in which Google’s AI model told users to put glue on pizza to make the cheese stop falling off. Some models can’t even correctly count the number of r’s in the word strawberry.\n\nThere’s a lot to loathe about artificial intelligence. It steals writing from books and movies and websites and newspapers and social media posts and YouTube videos. It helps companies spy on you. It ruins search engines. It wastes trillions of dollars. It eliminated numerous jobs, including those in animation, writing, music, gaming, and teaching, and it ruins others. It encourages plagiarizing. It perpetuates stereotypes and sexual harassment. It’s bad for the environment. It scams creators and readers to dangerous extremes. It aids censorship efforts. It spreads false scientific information. It lies and lies and lies. As an added bonus, the vibes of its creators are rancid.\n\nAnd yet, despite all the horror that generative AI brings, there is an obvious reason to use it to write books: money. It’s the digital solution for the uncle who is an inadequate writer and who, instead of improving his own skills, asks his niece to write a mystery novel using his idea because it’ll make them rich and famous. We live in a capitalist society. Everyone wants to make money.\n\nSelf-published authors, in particular, seem to lean on generative AI. In Josh Dzieza’s article “The Great Fiction of AI,” published in The Verge, author Jennifer Lepp admits to using the generative AI elements of the program Sudowrite to help finish her novels as quickly as possible. Under pressure from fans to keep churning out more material, it felt to Lepp—and other authors cited in the article—that this was the only route to “maintain relevance.”\n\nShe once surveyed her mailing list to ask how long readers would wait between books before abandoning her for another writer. The average was four months. Writer’s block is a luxury she can’t afford. . . . She had already compiled a database of novels to search when she felt she was overusing a phrase and wanted to see how other authors finished the sentence. She told herself she would use Sudowrite the same way—just inspiration, no cutting and pasting its prose. As an independent author, a small increase in production can yield big returns.\n\nTraditional publishing leapt on generative AI when it saw an opportunity to make a quick buck. 2023 saw the release of an AI-generated poetry collection called I Am Code and an AI-generated murder mystery called Death of An Author. Both books made big media splashes before disappearing fairly quickly. I’ve not heard a single person mention either one at my bookstore. I have no idea if Hachette Audio recouped what they spent on hiring Werner Herzog to narrate the audio edition of I Am Code.\n\nIn fact, relying on generative AI as a writer to make money is a … well, terrible long-term plan. Despite what the enthusiastic users of generative AI in “The Great Fiction of AI” claim, it’s statistically unlikely that generative AI will actually help us with productivity. From a craft perspective, Clarkesworld editor Neil Clarke found it easy to catch AI-generated submissions to the science fiction magazine, because they were “bad in spectacular ways.” The submissions will only get worse. Without more content to consume, the programs will begin cannibalizing the content generated by other programs, and “like vampires drinking their own blood, their prose [will] inevitably become successive degrees removed from actual human experience.”\n\nMoney is boring. Yeah, yeah, we all live under capitalism, yada yada. It’s the obvious reason to use generative AI. It may explain the use of generative AI by established writers and publishing executives, and some of the use of generative AI by new writers. But I don’t think it’s the main reason aspiring creatives are drawn to generative AI.\n\nThat reason rests in something NaNoWriMo once prided itself on: community.\n\nIf you ask a random person on the street, “Who creates a book?” they will tell you that it’s the author. The author writes it, after all. It’s their name on the cover.\n\nBut that’s not the whole truth.\n\nA book cannot be created without a writer. Much like reading, however, writing is a communal activity. While the initial act of writing might happen in a bubble—alone at a computer, jotting notes down on a phone, scribbling pages in a notebook on a lunch break—a published book is not made by one person alone. The words may come from one brain, but it takes a village to see them into their final form. There’s brainstorm buddies, beta readers, developmental editors, copyeditors. The idea itself may even come from outside the writer. Referring to artwork commissioned by private patrons or large companies, author Lincoln Michel wrote in his Counter Craft newsletter “Art Without Intention,” “Plenty of art both high and low has been made with prompts. The only thing new is the claim that the prompter—the person who didn’t actually make the thing—is somehow the artist.”\n\nIn “The Great Fiction of AI,” author Joanna Penn, who sells classes on how to use generative AI to improve your writing, observed that writers’ hesitation to use generative AI comes from “a misguided sense of purity: that writing should come from your unique, unaided brain.”\n\nBooks already do not come from one unique, unaided brain.\n\nBooks come from community.\n\nIt is impossible to write a book in a bubble. Books are seeds planted in a garden; just because a writer only tends to one seed, or a reader only sees one flower, does not mean that the plant grew in a soil somehow unaffected by the plants around it. Writers respond to the world around them, consciously or subconsciously—and as Ursula K. LeGuin points out in Steering the Craft, you cannot learn to be a better writer without reading the works of others in your garden (or your sea, to continue her boat metaphor) and without the guidance of others to improve your weakest craft elements.\n\nFrom famous writing collectives such as the Socrates School, the Bloomsbury Group, the Dymock Poets, or the Inklings (which is, far and away, the best named of the lot), to library classes for new writers, private Discord groups, and, yes, even NaNoWriMo meet-ups, communities help writers by giving them a place to learn, grow their craft, and share knowledge about the publishing industry. One of the only glorious aspects of the internet is that these communities are now accessible to anybody with a brave heart and a decent Wi-Fi connection.\n\nClaiming that disabled and other marginalized folks are unable to find community without the help of generative AI, as NaNoWriMo implied in their statement, is insulting, inadequate, and unhelpful. As author Sarah Gailey wrote in response to that statement, “The arguments themselves around this so-called classism and ableism wave off the actual existence of writing communities, critique groups, beta readers, and critique partners; they also ignore the creative realities of the impoverished and disabled artists, marginalized authors, and indie authors who have been working all this time without the help of language learning model software that was trained on work stolen from their peers and colleagues.”\n\nSharing your work with a community of real, live people can be . . . well, scary. My friends will tell you how loath I am to share any of my creative projects before I am certain they are ready to be seen. I would rather delete thousands of words than risk sharing something less than perfect. Leaning on generative AI strips some of the fear of sharing your imperfect work with other real, live people. It keeps the emotions of both the written work and its creation at arm’s length, leaving them inauthentic to both writer and reader. As Simon Peng writes in his Everybody’s Creative newsletter, “These generative programs give people an ‘out’ from working through the most emotionally difficult part of art making. If someone asks you why you drew that picture or wrote that song or built that chair, you can avoid all the messiness of trying to explain how, deep down, you are a person and you feel things and you just wanted to say something good.”\n\nThe messiness is a necessary part of the process—even though, gosh, I sometimes wish it weren’t. But the effort is what makes the work worthwhile. As Nick Cave writes, “Even though the creative act requires considerable effort, in the end you will be contributing to the vast network of love that supports human existence.”\n\nThe desire for community—to find themselves in that vast network of love—is what secretly appeals to the hearts of writers using generative AI. In “The Great Fiction of AI,” Dzieza writes, “Something about the experience of using AI feels different. It’s apparent in the way writers talk about it, which is often in the language of collaboration and partnership. . . . ‘Using the tool is like having a writing partner,’ [author Orna] Ross said. ‘A crazy one, completely off the wall, crazy partner who throws out all sorts of suggestions, who never gets tired, who’s always there. And certainly in the relationship that I have, I’m in charge.’”\n\nThat relationship—and being in charge—may make users of generative AI feel important. Writing communities, like any communities, can sometimes make even the most successful authors feel small if they’re not vibing with the group in the way they want. It may be why so many writers and generative AI users cling to social clout.\n\nSocial clout, especially in the digital space, is a huge element of reading and writing. It is one of the explanations for why so many people can’t just write: they have to perform the role of writer, even when the job of both writing and performing seems to make them miserable. (We are, of course, setting aside the complicated performance required by modern publishing to shill your book on social media at every available opportunity.) To end the digital performance would mean losing a position of privilege, which could make the person doing the digital dance feel less important. But clout that comes from generative AI is a house built on quicksand. It collapses the moment readers and fellow writers realize that you do not, in fact, care about the work you’re putting in the world—you simply want the credit for having created something.\n\nIn his four-hour video essay on plagiarism—a video I have watched more times than I am willing to admit—YouTuber Hbomberguy ends by exploring part of the reason he thinks people are willing to plagiarize:\n\nWe don't exactly live in a world built for humans, do we? There's no guidebook for happiness or success or a sense of place in the world, and the people claiming to have one for you are really just trying to sell you something. We spend most of our little lives struggling to make these feelings fade away or find something to placate them. It's either ennui or being on weed. I know it's a little pretentious, but we're all searching for a sense of meaning and purpose in our lives, and those things are hard to come by. There's a little bit of nothing in all of us, and we'd like to fill it with something. Opening your web browser and seeing someone who seems to have it figured out, making you feel better and entertaining you and seeming to attract an audience on this roulette wheel of a planet, that's powerful. There's someone who seems to understand what they're supposed to be doing, and it's working. That's all anyone really wants. . . . It's very difficult not to want that completeness for yourself—not to just be like someone, but to be them, to attain that sense of knowing. . . . I do worry there are people out there who will never get the chance to become who they are because they're too busy trying to be like someone else who, at best, has it figured out for themselves just a little bit.\n\nRobots cannot offer community. Generative AI cannot fill the hole in our souls where the desire to create—and the desire to be a part of a community that creates—eats away at us. Generative AI does not think. It does not feel. It does not know what you want. It does not even know what you are inputting into it. It knows words turned into data turned into numeric code, in response to which it spits back the best matching set of numeric code turned into data turned into words. It has no original ideas.\n\nGenerative AI has no heart. Generative AI has no soul. Generative AI cannot be your friend.\n\nGenerative AI cannot make you a better writer.\n\nIn the year 3024, WALL-E is real and he’s your best friend. He has great ideas about how to write a story! He’s watched a lot of musicals and has very strong feelings about plants and recycling and spaceships. He may be a little robot, but he’s got heart.\n\nUntil that day arrives, nobody wants to read a book written by or with the help of generative AI.\n\nLepp excuses her use of generative AI in “The Great Fiction of AI” because she otherwise runs the risk of her readers “abandoning her for another writer.” Not every reader can afford to buy every book—what a beautiful world that would be!—but the notion that readers would simply forget about Lepp in favor of whoever else happens to be churning out something similar means that Lepp is both embracing the idea of her own inadequacy—an idea that's at odds with the creation of good books—and dismissing her own community of fans. Yes, her books may be self-proclaimed “potato chip books,” but we all have our favorite potato chips—and we would prefer those chips to be made with real potatoes, not fried synthetic mush.\n\nUltimately, leaning on generative AI weakens Lepp’s own writing, because Lepp could be in conversation with the novelists and stories she views as competition rather than allowing generative AI to regurgitate similar elements of description within each one. Generative AI is good only at creating “derivative text”—if we can even call what it generates good. As programmers struggle to find more data to feed to the programs, generative AI struggles to create anything that is interesting for more than a few paragraphs. It lacks the intelligence to create novel-length plots. To create character arcs. To create moments that make readers really, truly feel.\n\nIn “Art Without Intention,” Michel writes:\n\nWhen AI generates a metaphor for how it feels to jump in a pool on the first day of summer, it isn’t drawing on experience or trying to communicate any specific emotion. And it is not deciding that this specific metaphor will emphasize the larger themes of the novel or deepen our understanding of the specific character. It produces automatically, without intention. And here, I think, is why so few people have been interested in buying AI-generated work despite all the hype. What is art without intention? Art without a vision behind it? It’s art that has nothing to say being sold by someone who doesn’t care. . . . Anyone can come up with ideas. And almost anyone can vomit up a rough draft. The hardest and most time-consuming part of writing is shaping, honing, and refining the material into a coherent work. This requires making choices both small and large at every point. You are shaping the text to your vision, and realizing your vision through shaping the text. It’s not a process you can outsource if you care about the work. And if you don’t care about your work, why would I care to read it?\n\nGenerative AI may have tried to write that, but it would have to first understand what Ted Chiang wrote in The New Yorker. Michel’s newsletter was written in response to “Why A.I. Isn’t Going to Make Art,” in which Chiang observes:\n\nSome individuals have defended large language models by saying that most of what human beings say or write isn’t particularly original. That is true, but it’s also irrelevant. When someone says “I’m sorry” to you, it doesn’t matter that other people have said sorry in the past; it doesn’t matter that “I’m sorry” is a string of text that is statistically unremarkable. If someone is being sincere, their apology is valuable and meaningful, even though apologies have previously been uttered. Likewise, when you tell someone that you’re happy to see them, you are saying something meaningful, even if it lacks novelty.\n\nSomething similar holds true for art. Whether you are creating a novel or a painting or a film, you are engaged in an act of communication between you and your audience. What you create doesn’t have to be utterly unlike every prior piece of art in human history to be valuable; the fact that you’re the one who is saying it, the fact that it derives from your unique life experience and arrives at a particular moment in the life of whoever is seeing your work, is what makes it new. We are all products of what has come before us, but it’s by living our lives in interaction with others that we bring meaning into the world. That is something that an auto-complete algorithm can never do, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nThat is community. That is writers in conversation with each other. This is writers learning from each other and improving their craft through intracommunity conversations—the same values that NaNoWriMo claims to promote.\n\nGenerative AI could not come up with the writing style and plot twists of We Deserve Monuments, one of my all-time favorite YA novels—a novel that author Jas Hammonds edited while attending Lambda Literary's Writers Retreat for Emerging LGBTQ Voices, which “turned out to be a major turning point in [their] writing journey.” Generative AI could not create the highs and lows of romance novels like The Seven Year Slip—a novel that author Ashley Poston rewrote numerous times with the help of her editor and her writer friends, honing in on its emotional arcs and wringing out her soul until she got the story just right. Generative AI cannot create stories, because generative AI is not a person. Generative AI is not a community.\n\nNaNoWriMo once understood the importance of community. It was the basis of the entire organization. The NaNoWriMo home page enthusiastically describes how “writing a novel alone can be difficult, even for seasoned writers” and that the organization helps creators “connect with other writers in a vast community.” But NaNoWriMo demolished its once-beloved forums, citing its problematic moderation staff while offering no alternative, even in person: There is no location on the website where writers can find physical, not digital, NaNoWriMo writing groups. (Rumor is that the national NaNoWriMo organization is at war with its community branches.)\n\nGreat news, though: NaNoWriMo’s new generative AI sponsor can help you out in their stead.\n\nMe? I’ll find my community elsewhere.",

      "# [Sudowrite Review: How Good Is It for Book Writing? by Michael Adams on 2025-03-28](https://bookquill.com/blog/sudowrite-review/)\nSuppose you have got a fantastic idea for a book. It’s fresh, thrilling, and might end up becoming the next big thing. You sit on your desk, open an empty document, and nothing. All of a sudden, your mind completely goes blank, as if your brain gets stuck like a loading screen.\n\nThat’s where you can seek help from Sudowrite! An AI-powered book writing tool that promises to help writers come up with ideas, get beyond writer’s block, and even write better. But wait, can human creativity be replaced by an AI book writer? Or is this really another overly excited robot attempting to mimic Shakespeare?\n\nThe following post is a Sudowrite review, examining if it is the best AI book writer free of major errors, how well it is in comparison to other AI tools, and whether you should write your book yourself or perhaps use these tools or hire an actual human writer instead.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nDevelopment of AI in Book Writing: According to Gartner research, more than 90% of web content will be produced by AI by 2026.\n\nWhat is Sudowrite? Sudowrite is a powerful AI writing tool that can help writers with brainstorming, good vocabulary, and coming up with ideas, and it assists them in writing better.\n\nComparison with Other AI Tools: Sudowrite is a lot better than other AI book writers like Jasper AI and ChatGPT in terms of story continuation skills, idea generation, and editing and rewriting skills.\n\nWho Should Use Sudowrite: It is best for those who are struggling with writer’s block, someone new to the writing industry, or authors who need ideas to write a fantasy or science fiction novel.\n\nBest Free AI Book Writer: Although Sudowrite is great at coming up with ideas and refining your writing, it offers limited free access.\n\nThe Development of AI in the Writing Industry\n\nDuring the last few years, we have seen a big change, especially relating to artificial intelligence, where almost all social media platforms and online services are using it.\n\nEvery business has been impacted by artificial intelligence, which can now drive cars, diagnose illnesses, forecast the stock market, and even recommend which Netflix shows you should stop watching after two episodes. But what about book writing? That’s where things get interesting!\n\nSo, what is it? A technological wonder or the end of the writing industry for humans? Well, according to OODALoop, AI will produce more than 90% of online content by 2026. But just because AI can write, it doesn’t mean it should. For example, artificial intelligence once suggested dubbing a sci-fi villain, “Bob the Destroyer,” which isn’t exactly scary.\n\nBut the big question is, Can AI replace custom professional book writing services, or will human writers always be the best?\n\nMany professional authors, editors, and premium book writing help services argue that great storytelling necessitates human experience, emotional depth, and, above all, a well-timed sarcastic remark. Which AI currently does not possess, so you are safe. But who knows, maybe in the future, they might have these skills too.\n\nComing back to the topic, let’s now review Sudowrite and see what it brings to the table.\n\nWhat is Sudowrite? (A Review of AI-Powered Writing Tool)\n\nIt’s like having a book-writing assistant who never takes breaks for coffee, never experiences writer’s block, and never argues about the plot. Introducing Sudowrite, an AI-powered writing tool that helps storytellers, screenwriters, and novelists overcome writing barriers and improve their language.\n\nWait, is Sudowrite the AI-powered Hemingway that we have all been waiting for? Or is it really a predictive text generator that also comes up with some weird stuff?\n\nLet’s discuss it in detail.\n\nWhat Does Sudowrite Do?\n\nThe main function of Sudowrite is to facilitate idea generation, improve readability, and accelerate the writing process. This AI can help if you need a fresh narrative twist, improved descriptions, or just need something to keep your imagination going.\n\nSudowrite is one of the most sophisticated AI writing assistants available, and its AI-driven skills are designed especially for fiction writers. In comparison to AI content spinners or simple grammatical checkers, Sudowrite understands character arcs, narrative flow, and pacing.\n\nLet’s now examine Sudowrite’s strongest features in more detail and see if they live up to the promise.\n\nSudowrite Review: AI or Just a Fancy Auto-Correct?\n\nSudowrite differs from other spellcheckers. It combines the functions of an editor, co-writer, and storyteller with AI-powered tools to make writing simpler and sometimes more bizarre. Below is a summary of its primary features:\n\n1. AI-Generated Story\n\nAt times, you just need a bit of inspiration when you start to write, and you have to stare at that blank page for hours only to discover that your brain has shut off for the day. But that can be solved; in fact, you may achieve some of your amazingly best aspirations with Sudowrite. Moreover, it recommends the next few paragraphs, whole scenes, or even complete plotlines; Sudowrite’s AI story generation can help you get your creative juices flowing.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nAfter analyzing your current sentence, the AI suggests several possible continuations.\n\nIt doesn’t seem like a robot took over your manuscript because it copies your tone and writing style.\n\nIt even suggests surprising story turns, which may be great or absolutely insane.\n\nPros:\n\nGreat for getting beyond writer’s block.\n\nHelps in the generation of new ideas.\n\nCapable of producing unexpectedly imaginative stuff.\n\nCons:\n\nToo random at times.\n\nMay lack emotionally.\n\nSo, we can call it an excellent brainstorming friend, but you will still need to guide the ship to prevent the AI from completely ruining your plot.\n\n2. Editing and Rewriting Skills\n\nAs an AI-powered editor, Sudowrite may help you write more naturally by suggesting other ways to phrase your sentences and making your writing easier to read. It is like a premium book writing help who never gets tired, never complains, and never criticizes your excessive use of adverbs.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nRewrite Mode: Offers different approaches to wording a paragraph or sentence.\n\nExpand Mode: Helps in adding depth to scenes that aren’t fully established.\n\nTone adjustment: Change your writing’s tone and style.\n\nPros:\n\nExcellent for polishing problematic phrases.\n\nHelps improve the fluency of non-native English writers.\n\nAble to modify style and tone to fit your writing.\n\nCons:\n\nSometimes misread the context (No Sudowrite! My “cold-blooded killer” isn’t a real reptile).\n\nThe unique voice of a writer is not always preserved.\n\nA great tool for editing, but it’s better not to replace your AI review writer just yet.\n\n3. Solutions for Writer’s Block\n\nSimilar to an overenthusiastic writing coach who won’t accept the response, “I don’t know what to write,” Sudowrite actively encourages your creativity to come out.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nMakes recommendations for dialogues to help conversations flow more naturally.\n\nProvides suggestions for character development to prevent your lead from feeling two-dimensional.\n\nIntroduces surprising plot twists, some of which are excellent and some of which are questionable.\n\nPros\n\nExcellent for fresh concepts and viewpoints.\n\nHelps in avoiding clichéd storylines.\n\nFunctions similarly to a writing partner.\n\nCons:\n\nSometimes produces strange and illogical ideas.\n\nDoes not take the place of human storytelling intuition.\n\nIt’s similar to brainstorming with a writing partner who is surprisingly perceptive but also rather insane.\n\nSudowrite vs. Other AI Book Writer Tools: The Ultimate Face-Off\n\nThe way authors approach idea generation, editing, and storytelling has been completely changed by artificial intelligence. With so many premium book-writing companies on the market today, it’s important for authors and novelists to compare them to determine which one best suits their needs.\n\nWhile ChatGPT and Jasper AI are more all-purpose writing tools, Sudowrite is a program specifically designed for fiction writers. Let’s explore each of their characteristics and compare them.\n\n1. Story Continuation\n\nSudowrite: Yes!\n\nThe capacity of Sudowrite to carry on a story naturally while copying the tone and style of the original text is one of its best qualities. This function is quite helpful for writers who are having trouble coming up with ideas because the AI makes natural-feeling suggestions for smooth continuations. To preserve consistency, it takes into account characters, storylines, and previous narrative elements.\n\nJasper AI: No!\n\nJasper AI doesn’t have specialized fiction writing skills because it is primarily concerned with blog articles, marketing content, and business writing. Although it is capable of generating short-form content, it lacks sophisticated plot continuation capabilities that are appropriate for book writing.\n\nChatGPT: Yes!\n\nChatGPT’s extensive language model, which has been trained on a variety of texts, enables it to generate story continuations efficiently. ChatGPT’s output, in comparison to Sudowrite, might not have structured storytelling elements, requiring greater user intervention to preserve a strong plotline.\n\n2. Editing & Rewriting\n\nSudowrite: Yes!\n\nSudowrite is very good at editing and refining prose. It provides attributes such as:\n\nOffers different wordings and improvements.\n\nHelps in bringing underdeveloped scenes to life.\n\nModifies words to fit the intended tone and style.\n\nThis makes it a useful tool for writers who want to refine their work without losing their identity.\n\nJasper AI: Yes!\n\nAlthough Jasper has strong editing and rewriting features, these are more suited for marketing and business content than story writing. Jasper is a great choice if you need help with an advertisement, email, or blog post, but it doesn’t provide the sophisticated approach that fiction authors need.\n\nChatGPT: Yes!\n\nAlthough ChatGPT helps revise and improve the text, the changes could be odd because it doesn’t have organized editing tools. Although it can improve phrasing, it lacks Sudowrite’s profoundly creative rewriting skills.\n\n3. Idea Generation\n\nSudowrite: Yes!\n\nThe skills of Sudowrite to produce original ideas are one of its main advantages. It may suggest:\n\nTurns in the plot\n\nArcs of characters\n\nImprovements in dialogue\n\nDescriptions of the settings\n\nFor authors searching for new ideas without feeling overly dependent on AI, this function is the best.\n\nJasper AI: No!\n\nJasper doesn’t offer the same innovative brainstorming tools that fiction writers require because it was designed for business writing. It can come up with marketing concepts, but it won’t do anything to help you write a compelling book.\n\nChatGPT: Yes!\n\nWith its imaginative ideas for characters, settings, and plot points, ChatGPT may be a fantastic brainstorming tool for authors. However, since it is a general AI, it doesn’t specialize in fiction writing approaches the way Sudowrite does.\n\n4.

Is It Right for You?\n\nSudowrite is more than just another artificial intelligence writing tool. It’s like that too-enthusiastic writing friend who never stops talking. Sometimes, it’s a brilliant idea; other times, it suggests that your detective protagonist is actually a time-traveling platypus. Either way, it’s here to help, but is it the right fit for you?\n\nPerfect for:\n\nWriter’s Facing Writer’s Block: Did you find it offensive to stare at a blank page as if it were personal? Sudowrite can help you move forward with new concepts, scene extensions, and just the right amount of AI-generated chaos.\n\nBeginners Who Need Guidance: Sudowrite acts as a friendly guide to help them with writing.\n\nSci-fi and Fantasy Authors: Authors of fantasy and science fiction AI enjoy coming up with crazy and modern ideas. Do you need a planet where intelligent mushrooms rule? Done. A kingdom in the Middle Ages where everyone used interpretative dance to communicate? Why not?\n\nProbably Not For:\n\nWriters Who Thrive On Emotional Depth: AI may not be up to par if your work depends on the raw and soul-crushing feeling that makes people cry uncontrollably into their tea. It won’t feel words, but it can produce them.\n\nAuthors Who Require Human Revisions: Best book writing help services are still preferable if you want the careful and hands-on editing that only an experienced expert can offer. Although Sudowrite is excellent for last-minute adjustments, it won’t exactly go over each sentence like a perfectionist on a deadline.\n\nIs Sudowrite the Best AI Book Writing Tool?\n\nSo, is Sudowrite the greatest AI book writer? Well, not entirely! Though it’s not perfect, it’s great for helping you with ideas, polishing writing, and getting rid of writer’s block.\n\nAlthough AI can help, human writers and premium eBook writing services continue to dominate the field of creating fascinating, emotionally impactful stories.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI assistant, then Sudowrite is a fantastic option. But are you considering AI to write your whole next great American novel? That might not be a good choice! For that, we recommend that you hire a writer.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile Sudowrite is a helpful AI tool for producing books, it cannot completely replace humans. It’s a useful tool for storytelling, editing, and brainstorming. It can bring you tons of ideas, some of which are fantastic, some of which are completely strange. Although it won’t replace your work just yet, it will simplify your life. Moreover, it can help you if you are having trouble coming up with ideas, have trouble with awkward words, or just need a brainstorming partner that never stops.\n\nBut honestly, AI still lacks the emotional essence that makes human storytelling attractive. It can produce thousands of words in a matter of seconds, but can it convey the pain of a broken heart, the excitement of a surprising turn, or the serious impact of a single and well-placed comma? Not exactly.\n\nSo, what is your final decision? Will you continue to use the power of human imagination, or will you trust your story with AI? The choice is yours!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs Sudowrite The Best AI Book Writing Tool For Novelists?\n\nOne of the most advanced AI book-writing tools is called Sudowrite, and it was created especially for fiction writers. It is an excellent tool for novelists because of its expertise in story continuation, brainstorming, and revising. It may, however, lack the thoughtful, emotional complexity and human touch that human authors contribute to storytelling. But if you ask if they can replace humans? The answer is no; although technology is a helpful tool for writers, it can’t fully replace human creativity.\n\nIs It Free To Use Sudowrite, the Best AI Book Writer For Free?\n\nEven though it’s one of the most advanced AI book-writing tools out there, it requires a paid subscription after its free trial period. It’s not totally free; you might have to choose limited access or make feature compromises if you want to use the best AI book writer for free.\n\nCan Sudowrite Replace Custom Professional Book Writing Services?\n\nNo, although Sudowrite is a strong artificial intelligence book writing tool, it cannot completely take the place of specialized and expert book writing services. While it can help with brainstorming, story generation, and editing, a premium book writing company offers in-depth storytelling, emotional depth, and refined manuscripts that are ready for publication.\n\nWhat Is The Difference Between Sudowrite And Premium EBook Writing Services?\n\nUnlike premium eBook writing services, Sudowrite works as an AI review writer, helping authors refine their writings. However, for well-written and well-edited books, services from a premium bookwriting company still have the upper hand. Although Sudowrite speeds up the process, without human assistance, it cannot produce a manuscript that is ready for publication.\n\nIs Sudowrite a Good Choice for Authors Looking for the Best Book Writing Help Services?\n\nYes! Sudowrite is an excellent resource if you require the best book writing help services for ideation, getting beyond writer’s block, or refining manuscripts. However, custom professional book writing services might be a better option for complex projects that call for skilled storytelling.\n\nCan I Book a Writer Through Sudowrite?\n\nSince Sudowrite is an AI book writer, it cannot put you in touch with real authors. You will require premium book writing help from companies that offer both human knowledge and AI-powered technologies, like BookQuill if you choose to hire a writer for individualized advice or a fully ghostwritten work.\n\nAbout Author\n\nHi, my name is Zachary Stone I’m a book marketing nut — or, as I like to call myself, a “Shelf Marketer.” No, I don’t sell wooden shelves; I market the books that are left forgotten on them.

      "# [Sudowrite Review (2025): As Good As A Human? by Jamie Giggs on 2024-03-15](https://bloggingwizard.com/sudowrite-review/)\nWelcome to our Sudowrite review.\n\nSudowrite is an AI writing tool that helps writers finish their manuscripts.\n\nThe platform features a story engine, rewrite functionality, and is able to provide feedback as you progress.\n\nThe key question: is it worth your time?\n\nBy the end of this review, you’ll know the answer, including whether it suits your specific needs.\n\nWe’ll dive into Sudowrite’s capabilities, explore the plans available, and detail what we think are the software’s main pros and cons.\n\nWhat is Sudowrite?\n\nSudowrite is an AI writing tool founded in 2020 by science fiction writers Amit Gupta and James Yu.\n\nAs writers themselves, Amit and James knew all too well the pain that writers experience when rewriting their beloved manuscripts for the 1000th time (trust me, I’ve been there!).\n\nThe pair wanted to create software that broke through writer’s block and invented narrative twists for the user, so writers spent less time dreading the process (and contemplating reality itself) and more time actually writing.\n\nThe result of their efforts? A tool that, at its best, can effectively deliver cogent paragraphs of text that can inspire you to keep writing. One that’s used by over 12,000 novelists, screenwriters, and storytellers.\n\nThat said, is it enough to become your AI writing tool of choice, or should you continue to push on without the help of a machine?\n\nContinue reading for our full review of Sudowrite. I’ll discuss the pros and cons and a few alternatives, too.\n\nWhat features does Sudowrite offer?\n\nSudowrite is a popular AI writing tool. The key features worth knowing about include:\n\nAI writer\n\nRewriter\n\nDescribe\n\nBrainstorm\n\nPoem generator\n\nCustomer support\n\nIntegrations\n\nWe’ll explore these features and give you a first-hand look at the tool.\n\nPlease note: Some of Sudowrite’s features are only available in specific pricing plans.\n\nGetting started\n\nOnce you’ve logged into Sudowrite, you’ll be taken to a screen that looks like this:\n\nIt’s here where you’ll be able to use the central features of the AI writing tool.\n\nIt’s worth noting that there’s also a “tour” feature that takes you through the basics (if need be).\n\nAI writer\n\nTo start using the AI writer, you’ll first need to give it something to work with. This isn’t a couple of words either; the tool requires at least 20 words or more before the cursor.\n\nThere are two ways you can do this: putting in the required 20 words and clicking Write, or turning on the Story Bible (formerly Sudowrite’s story engine) like so:\n\nEssentially, using the Story Bible makes the tool more accurate because you fill in the key details yourself. Those key details include the synopsis of your novel, the style you want it to be written in, details of the main characters, the genre, and, if you can provide it, a general outline of your story by chapter.\n\nThere’s also a section called Braindump. This is where you can put in any extra details and in any form you want, whether that’s a stream-of-consciousness word salad or just a few sentences.\n\nBefore we take a look at the results of the Story Bible mode, let’s see what the regular mode can produce.\n\nI asked the tool to start writing a novel based on a jaded teacher who explores the origins of a portal. Here’s a snippet of what it came up with:\n\n“As Angus trudged along the rugged path in the Scottish Highlands, his mind was clouded with a sense of melancholy. The weight of his monotonous existence as a jaded teacher seemed to grow heavier with each passing day. He had lost the spark that once ignited his passion for education, leaving him with an empty heart and a hollow soul.”\n\nIt’s not bad. Sudowrite has focused on the key elements of the story, including the jaded teacher, and chosen a good setting for him to explore. There’s quite a bit of telling here, though, rather than showing, so it would definitely need editing. That said, it may well be a good starting point if I needed an idea I could run with.\n\nWe can choose to Insert this text into the main editor, and from there, we can edit it as required. That said, it’s more of a summary piece of text than an actual chapter of a novel, which takes us back to the Story Bible mode.\n\nIf we fill out the details like character, setting, and provide a synopsis for our novel, we can get Sudowrite to create the first draft of a chapter. I input the details, and this was the result of the opening of Chapter 1:\n\n“In the bustling city of New York, Angus, a young journalist, begins to notice strange occurrences in the local government. He starts to collect information for a story, but the closer he gets to the truth, the more he is warned to stay away.”\n\nIt sounds pretty engaging, although it’s worth mentioning that the tool struggled to fill out the rest of the chapter and has changed our main character, Angus, to a young journalist living in New York. What’s here is good, but the details aren’t exactly what I asked for.\n\nThat being said, the tool can go further. I asked it to expand the text, and it came up with the next 15 chapters.\n\nFor example, in Chapter 5, Angus meets a man named Jeff, who trains him in self-defense, hacking, and espionage techniques. Angus also learns about the history of mind-control technology and how it’s been secretly developed over decades.\n\nThe rest of the outline is relatively decent and would certainly help an author during the preliminary stages of planning their novel. As a way of generating ideas, it’s solid.\n\nI asked the tool again to expand the first chapter, and here’s one of the opening paragraphs:\n\n“A woman’s voice chimed in, her tone icy and detached, ‘we discovered that our suspicions were correct—the government has been conducting experiments on innocent civilians.’ She paused for effect, her breath frosting as it met the frigid air. ‘Not just any experiments, though. They’re trying to create…monsters.’\n\n“‘Monsters?’ Angus echoed, his voice barely above a whisper. His mind raced with horrifying images, each one more grotesque than the last. Unwillingly, he recalled the eerie stories his grandmother used to tell him as a child, stories he had long dismissed as mere folklore.”\n\nAs an opener, this definitely lures the reader in. However, the story is a little basic and seems to involve the government creating “monsters.” As it goes on, some of the text lacks the depth I’d expect from a published novel, and it does come across as somewhat amateur.\n\nThat said, we can choose to add this text to the editor and refine it from there:\n\nOverall, the AI writer, albeit far from perfect, is a great way to bounce story ideas around.\n\nRewriter\n\nSudowrite’s Rewriter feature is a useful addition to the suite. Clicking the Rewrite button allows us to change bits of text we’re not happy with and even alter the writing style:\n\nFor the first paragraph of Chapter 1, I asked the tool to rewrite it in a more descriptive style. Here’s a snippet of the result:\n\n“The narrow alleyway loomed before Angus, its walls closing in on him as he approached the designated meeting spot. The air felt thick and heavy, like a looming sense of danger that threatened to suffocate him.\n\nHis heart thudded heavily against his ribcage, matching the rhythm of his quickened steps. Beads of sweat gathered at his temples, despite the biting cold that seeped into his bones. He questioned his sanity for getting involved with this dangerous conspiracy, but there was no turning back now.”\n\nWe can see that, in no time at all, more adjectives have been added to the text. The text, as a whole, now feels more engaging and works better as a pacey opener to what I would imagine would be a cross between mystery and thriller.\n\nWe can choose to rephrase the text if we’re unsure about the result simply by clicking Rephrase. Here’s that same paragraph reworked:\n\n“Angus felt the walls of the dim alleyway closing in on him as he made his way towards the predetermined meeting spot. His heart pounded against his chest and sweat formed on his forehead, despite the frigid air. He couldn’t help but question his own judgment for getting involved in this dangerous scheme, but it was too late to turn back now.”\n\nAs you can see, a selection of words have been changed, with others moved around. Sudowrite provides you with variants of the rewrite. For instance, if I scroll down the page, I can see a more descriptive version of the rewrite, one that’s another rephrase, and an additional descriptive version, giving me plenty of choice.\n\nI can also use the rewrite functionality to add more in the way of showing rather than telling to the piece. All good writers know the importance of getting these two right, and it’s great to see an option to cut down on some of that intrusive telling. Here’s the result:\n\n“The narrow alley was shrouded in darkness as Angus cautiously made his way towards the designated meeting spot. The cold air stung his cheeks and he could feel his heart pounding against his chest.\n\nHis palms were slick with sweat, a mixture of nerves and fear. As he approached the figure standing in the shadows, he couldn’t help but question his judgement for getting involved in this dangerous scheme. But it was too late to turn back.”\n\nThe cold air stinging his cheeks creates a strong image in our mind, and it’s a more powerful way of showing the reader that it’s cold. That said, I’m not sure we need to even say it’s cold. We could show that further, although that’s a story for another time.\n\nAll in all, the rewrite functionality impressed me, and while I wouldn’t rely on it solely, it could serve as a way to get me writing again.\n\nDescribe\n\nLeaving Angus and the government monster scheme behind, another notable feature of Sudowrite is the Describe feature. We can activate it like so:\n\nWe simply highlight a word or phrase we want to describe, and Sudowrite will give us suggestions based on all five senses–this includes the use of metaphors.\n\nKeeping to the theme, I highlighted the word “Monster,” and this was what the tool produced for sight:\n\n“The monster’s body was a tangle of twisted limbs, each one ending in sharp claws that glinted in the dim light. Its skin was a sickly pale color, almost translucent, and covered in pulsating veins.”\n\nHere’s what it generated for smell:\n\n“The stench of decay surrounds the monster, a mixture of rotting flesh and damp earth. Its breath reeks of death and its presence fills the air with a nauseating odor.”\n\nQuite vivid. Here’s another for taste:\n\n“The thought of tasting the monster’s flesh made one’s stomach churn. It was said that those who had tried had described it as a foul combination of dirt, mold, and something unidentifiable yet repulsive.”\n\nIn terms of metaphors, Sudowrite generated this:\n\n“The monster was born of shadows and whispers, a creature of the night with eyes that glowed like embers and a roar that could shatter even the bravest of hearts. Its terrifying form was both primordial and otherworldly, a reminder of the dark secrets that lurk within us all.”\n\nThe senses are better than the metaphor. Still, it’s a helpful addition to get the neurons firing.\n\nBrainstorm\n\nWhat about those times when you just need writing ideas in general, whether it’s character names, settings, or even plot points? Well, Sudowrite does have a feature that can help.\n\nIt’s located here:\n\nOnce we’ve clicked that, we’re taken to an attractive-looking grid:\n\nIt’s here where we can pick the specific part of writing we need help with. As a fan of great world-building myself, I chose to see what Sudowrite could do in that department. Here’s the result:\n\n“A mysterious black stone found only in the depths of the ocean, it glows with a faint blue light and has been known to give its owner the power to control minds.”\n\nIt’s a strange derivative, considering I asked the tool to describe a fantasy world. I tried again, and here was the second result:\n\n“The Phantom’s Touch: An illegal substance created from the ashes of a being from a different dimension, it gives the user the ability to phase through objects and render themselves invisible for a short period of time.”\n\nWhile I like the description here, I asked the tool to do something else. I played some more with it and found that Sudowrite prefers to describe items within the fictional world rather than the world itself.\n\nNot the best result here.\n\nI tried asking the tool to create some names for an island nation inhabited by warriors. The results:\n\nThundercliff\n\nSavage Coast\n\nValoria\n\nShieldhaven\n\nShield Isle\n\nA better result overall, although it’s clear Sudowrite does have its limitations.\n\nPoem generator\n\nPoem lovers will be pleased to know that Sudowrite can create poems. I asked it to create a poem on danger, and here’s the first paragraph of what it came up with:\n\nBullets for Breakfast\n\nIn the land of the free, we sip coffee and load our guns\n\nWe cook our eggs and fry our bacon,\n\nButter our toast and oil our guns\n\nWe kiss our loved ones goodbye and holster our guns\n\nIt’s a decent result, if a tad nonsensical.\n\nI asked it to create a second poem on writing itself:\n\nThe Muse’s Gift\n\nIt comes in waves, this gift of words\n\nSometimes a trickle, sometimes a flood\n\nA turn of phrase, a thought profound\n\nWords from my muse, my pen unbound\n\nA better result.\n\nHow much mileage you’ll get out of the poem generator will depend on your needs, but it’s a respectable extra.\n\nCustomer support\n\nSudowrite does feature customer support, albeit one that isn’t that extensive.\n\nBy clicking the question mark symbol on the dashboard, you’ll be able to reach the team via email, live chat, or you can, instead, consult the FAQ guide:\n\nThe FAQs are simple but get the job done with some (fairly) thorough answers.\n\nThe live chat loaded up quickly, although I did have to wait some time before a member of the team could answer my query. Clicking the Support button at the bottom of the page will also bring up the live chat.\n\nFinally, there’s the ability to suggest new features to the team–something I thought was welcome.\n\nIntegrations\n\nSudowrite’s integrations are currently limited. The tool integrates with Google Docs, Invoice2go, and Airtable.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nSudowrite comes in three main tiers: Hobby & Student, Professional, and Max. Naturally, each plan includes differing features, benefits, and usage limits.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each of them.\n\nSudowrite’s Hobby & Student plan starts at $10 per month on the yearly plan or $19 on the monthly plan. It includes 225,000 credits per month.\n\nA credit is based on the AI model and how many words it reads and writes for you. This plan comes with a free trial, and no credit card is required. It’s aimed at people who write for fun or for school and need help with the writing process. There’s enough here for a story idea or two, and the twist feature is available.\n\nSudowrite’s Professional plan starts at $22 per month on the yearly plan or $29 on the monthly plan. It currently includes 1,000,000 credits per month (although this is subject to change). This plan comes with a free trial, and no credit card is required. It’s intended for those who want to write a novel or screenplay using AI tools. Note the Story Engine feature for writing stories is now known as the Story Bible.\n\nSudowrite’s Max plan starts at $44 per month on the yearly plan or $59 on the monthly plan. It includes 2,000,000 credits per month. It’s aimed at prolific authors who publish multiple novels and screenplays a year and need to keep their creative juices flowing.\n\nPros and cons\n\nSudowrite is a well-designed AI writing assistant for story writing, but it also has its weaknesses. Here’s a brief round-up of what we thought were the biggest pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\nAI writer. It’s not perfect, but the AI tool can successfully create text for your novel, whether that’s a chapter summary or the entire chapter itself. This can be achieved in a few minutes if you have the necessary credits.\n\nRewriter functionality. The option to rewrite paragraphs and include more showing (and less telling) is here. You can also add in extra description or make sentences more intense. This is perhaps the most useful part for full-time writers.\n\nWriting senses generator. Sudowrite can generate descriptions for each of the five senses based on a single word or phrase. You can also get it to produce metaphors of varying quality. It’s a helpful feature.\n\nCons\n\nAffordability. The tool could be cheaper, and the credits won’t last long if you’re attempting a full novel of 70,000+ words.\n\nLack of integrations. There are very few integrations at the time of writing, although we do expect this to change over time.\n\nCustomer support. What’s here is serviceable, but it’s not outstanding. There isn’t much in the way of additional support should you need it.\n\nAlternatives\n\nNeed to look at some alternatives? Check out our recommended AI writing tools before we head to our Sudowrite review conclusion:\n\nRytr | Our review — A fantastic all-round AI writer with additional generative AI capabilities. With an AI image generator that punches above its weight, exclusive writing profiles for copywriters, and over 40 different use cases, including emails, poems, and video descriptions, the value for money speaks for itself.\n\nFrase | Our review — One of the best AI content creation and writing tools available with a lot of hidden functionality within its features.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThat concludes our Sudowrite review.\n\nOverall, Sudowrite allows you to quickly generate text for your novel or screenplay in a few clicks.\n\nWhile it may not be able to produce chapters without edits or come up with the most original prose, most aspiring writers will absolutely find its ability to bounce ideas around useful.\n\nThe rewrite functionality, in particular, is easy to use and, in the right scenario, will break through even the most stubborn writer’s block.\n\nWe recommend you give any of the free plans a try to see if it’s the best AI writing tool for you.",

After exploring all the available options in each category, I’ve carefully selected the best tools based on my personal experience. This ensures that the recommendations come from real, practical use, so you can trust that they’re grounded in what actually works.\n\nFor each tool, I focus on its best use cases, explaining when and how it can be most useful. I also share what I love about each one, as well as any downsides I’ve encountered during my experience. Additionally, I provide information on the free version and premium pricing plans for each tool.\n\nFree AI tools\n\nIf you're looking for free AI tools, you're in luck! I made sure that every AI tool listed in this article offers either a free plan or free trial with no credit card required, allowing you to explore their features and functionality without any commitment.\n\nThe best AI assistants (chatbots)\n\nCh‎atGPT\n\nChatGPT consistently ranks at the top of the LM Arena leaderboard, outperforming other models in key benchmarks. It's the world's most popular AI application, with 200 million users as of October 2024.\n\nI’ve used ChatGPT extensively for brainstorming ideas, translation tasks, coding, AI script generation, data analysis and managing research-heavy tasks. The new 4o model is a significant leap forward—it’s incredibly fast, and feels way smarter than any of the previous versions of ChatGPT.\n\nWith ChatGPT's multimodal capabilities I can paste in images—like a chart or graph—and ask questions about it, making it much easier to interpret visual data quickly. I fed it a PNG image of a chart and it analysed the chart, gave me a table of the raw data (that it read from the chart image) and then re-did the chart in my preferred colors - pretty impressive.\n\nChatGPT can now retain context over time, personalizing responses based on previous conversations. For instance, I’ve used it to refine recurring project ideas without re-explaining every detail, saving hours of effort. You can review and manage what it remembers through OpenAI’s controls, to make sure it doesn't go all Skynet on you.\n\nThe integrated ChatGPT search option (more on this later) makes it even easier to find relevant information directly within conversations, which cuts down on the hallucinations with the use of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). RAG grounds the AI's answer by retrieving information from external data sources.\n\nWhile it excels in creative and general-purpose tasks, I’d recommend exploring other tools like Claude (see below) for coding. It's not that ChatGPT is bad at coding tasks, it's just that Claude is great at them.\n\nChatGPT o1\n\no1 is a specialized advanced reasoning model built for complex problem-solving, coding, and math.\n\nWhile I find 4o excels in creativity and versatility, o1 has proven incredibly useful for specific tasks like coding, troubleshooting technical issues, and even solving intricate math problems that other models struggled with. I’ve used it to generate shell scripts, work through spreadsheet problems, and even tackle cryptic crossword puzzles, where its precision and logical depth really shine.\n\nHowever, it lacks the broader capabilities and tool integrations of 4o, so I see it more as a complementary option for specific needs rather than a full replacement for more creative or expansive tasks.\n\nOperators\n\nIn January 2025, ChatGPT introduced \"Operators,\" AI agents that can book hotels, order food, and shop online. Exclusive to Pro users ($200/month), they show exciting potential but are hit-or-miss in execution.\n\nFor instance, I asked the Operator to book a hotel in NYC. It started strong, navigating filters and searching TripAdvisor, but eventually got stuck in a loop. Ordering a pizza was similar—it customized the order but couldn’t complete checkout. Shopping worked better; it found a laptop under $1,000 on Amazon but required me to finish the purchase manually. Operators let you take control when they get stuck, but the laggy browser often makes doing it yourself easier.\n\nRight now, Operators feel more like a proof-of-concept than a practical tool. While the idea of automating repetitive tasks is exciting, it needs improvements in speed and reliability. If you’re already a Pro user, it’s worth exploring, but not essential yet.\n\nPricing\n\nOpenAI offer a free tier which currently gives you limited access to GPT-4o and unlimited access to ChatGPT-4o mini. The Plus plan gets you wider access and costs $20/month - I think that's pretty good value for money. They also offer a Pro plan for $200/month which gives you priority access to their latest tools.\n\nCl‎aude\n\nI’ve been using Claude (their Sonnet 3.5 model to be specific), for coding tasks, and it’s quickly becoming my go-to for code reviews. What really makes Claude stand out is how precise it is—it seems to \"get\" the nuances of programming better than other tools I’ve tried. I’ve used it to spot subtle issues in my code and even brainstorm better ways to structure projects. Anthropic are training these models on more recent and specialized coding knowledge and it shows, especially when tackling modern frameworks or troubleshooting tricky bugs.\n\nAnother thing I love about Claude is how nice it is to talk to. It feels like it has more \"soul\" compared to ChatGPT—the tone is warmer, and conversations just flow better. Whether I’m bouncing around ideas or working through a complicated issue, it’s genuinely pleasant to interact with. I have quite reached Her levels of affection for Claude, but we're getting there.\n\nThat said, I have hit the response and rate limits a little faster than I’d like, which can be a hassle if I’m deep into a project. But for $20/month on the Pro plan, it’s still a great deal, especially if you’re looking for an AI assistant that’s smart, approachable, and particularly strong in coding tasks.\n\nGe‎mini\n\nGoogle’s Gemini fits seamlessly into the Google ecosystem. On Android, it feels like a natural extension of the system rather than a separate app, and if you’re already using Google Workspace, it’s incredibly convenient. Whether I was drafting emails, summarizing articles, or asking it random questions, it delivered quickly and smoothly.\n\nI’ve found it useful in unexpected ways too. When reviewing legal documents, I’d do my initial read-through and then ask Gemini to double-check if I missed anything. Another time, I struggled with a confusing sizing chart while shopping for clothes. I snapped a picture of the label, described my usual size, and let Gemini handle the rest. The suggestion was spot-on, and I ended up with a perfect fit!\n\nFor creative projects, Gemini’s image capabilities really shine. I once uploaded an image I liked and asked it to describe it as a prompt for an AI image generator. The results were creative and inspiring, making it a fun tool for brainstorming new ideas.\n\nWhen I was working on a project proposal, Gemini Advanced provided nuanced, tailored suggestions that felt like a genuine productivity boost. It even made copywriting easier—generating meaningful text for design mockups that felt polished, rather than using generic filler like \"Lorem Ipsum.\"\n\nHowever, it’s not perfect. One frustration I had was with its context retention. When revising a piece of writing, I had to re-explain instructions a few times because it would forget what we’d already discussed. Similarly, when I uploaded an Excel file, got a summary, and later updated the data, Gemini treated the updated file as a brand-new task instead of building on what we’d already done.\n\nAnother weak spot is its performance on technical tasks. While it’s great at formatting and debugging simple code, I found that it sometimes rewrote JavaScript as Python unnecessarily. For more specialized or dense content, like legal texts, its analysis lacked depth compared to what I was hoping for. Even its responses to some image-based queries were occasionally inaccurate, which was a letdown after seeing its creative potential elsewhere.\n\nThat said, Gemini’s strengths outweigh its flaws. Its tight integration with Google tools makes it practical for anyone already in the Google ecosystem, and its ability to handle both text and images makes it a versatile tool for creative projects. While it’s not the best choice for highly technical or niche tasks, it’s a solid, fast, and easy-to-use assistant for everyday needs—and for me, the advanced features have made it a tool I’ve come to rely on.\n\nWhile the free Basic version (using the 1.5 Flash model) covers most casual needs, the $19.99/month Gemini Advanced adds the more powerful 1.5 Pro and Gemini-Exp-1206 models for complex tasks like coding, math, and deep research, including analyzing texts up to 1,500 pages.\n\nDe‎epSeek\n\nDeepSeek is also worth checking out. They let you use their V3 and new R1 models for free on their site, although you still have to pay for API access (it's very cheap though).\n\nDeepSeek's search feels more engaging and \"sticky\" even after just a few queries. Its transparency—showing reasoning and openly acknowledging what it knows and what it might not—builds a significant level of user trust.\n\nIn January 2025, they launched their R1 model as a competitor to ChatGPT's o1, quickly gaining attention in the AI community for being both cost-effective and open source. I've played around with both their R1 and V3 models.\n\nI asked both ChatGPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 to analyze sections of a presentation I’m working on. R1 provided a more comprehensive analysis, addressing key aspects that o1 overlooked. I also had both brainstorm ideas, and once again, R1 delivered significantly better suggestions than o1.\n\nFor coding I’ve been relying more on DeepSeek (v3) lately because of its straightforward approach—it gets straight to the point with its suggestions. Claude (3.5 Sonnet), by contrast, often takes a more detailed route, proposing multiple solutions and leaning toward the one that aligns best with solid software engineering practices. Both tools are excellent in their own ways, and I’ve started using them equally. DeepSeek is great for its affordability and efficiency, while Claude is invaluable for double-checking critical code and ensuring everything is on point. Together, they make a great team.\n\nFor writing, I'm less keen on these DeepSeek models. I find its output less natural-sounding and oftentimes boring and repetitive.\n\nGr‎ok\n\n‎Grok 3 is a capable model that handles most tasks well, but in my experience, it doesn’t feel significantly different from other top-tier LLMs.\n\nI tested it for brainstorming, coding assistance, and extended conversations, and while it performed reliably, nothing about it truly stood out.\n\nIt does a decent job at keeping context and generating detailed responses, but when I compared it to ChatGPT and Claude, I found its coding suggestions to be hit-or-miss. Some solutions were spot on, while others required heavy corrections, which isn’t uncommon with AI coding assistants, but it didn’t seem to have the same level of consistency as the best models out there.\n\nWhat does makes Grok 3 unique is its direct access to real-time Twitter data, which could give it an advantage for up-to-date information, but I didn’t find it noticeably better at current events than other AI models.\n\nIt also has far fewer content restrictions, meaning it’s more open to generating responses that other LLMs outright refuse. While that might appeal to some users, it also raises concerns, especially when it comes to generating highly offensive or legally questionable content.\n\nAnd then there’s the cost. Unlike other free-tier AI models, accessing Grok 3 requires an X Premium+ subscription at $40/month, which makes it one of the more expensive options.\n\nWhile it’s solid and functional, I didn’t walk away feeling like it was a must-have over existing models, especially considering the price barrier.\n\nTh‎e best AI video generators\n\nSy‎‎nthesia\n\nSynthesia is the leading AI video generator platform designed for studio-quality video content with AI avatars. I’ve used it for creating training modules and presentations, and it’s clear why it’s a favorite for learning and development (L&D) teams. By turning text into video, Synthesia simplifies the production of high-quality content without the need for cameras, microphones, or studios.\n\nIts most popular use case is undoubtedly training videos, but Synthesia is versatile enough to handle a wide range of needs. Businesses use it for internal communications, onboarding new employees, and creating customer support or knowledge base videos. On the marketing side, it excels in producing personalized sales outreach videos, B2B marketing content, explainer videos and even product demos. I’ve personally also found it handy for website videos that needed a polished, professional touch with minimal effort.\n\nTwo things I love about Synthesia are the ability to customize avatars and the wide variety of templates offered. When I needed to create tailored training videos for different departments, Synthesia made it easy to switch the avatar language, tone, or background to suit the audience. The library of over 230 digital avatars and support for 140+ languages means you can create globally consistent content effortlessly.\n\nWhile Synthesia shines for corporate-style videos, it’s not designed for storytelling or cinematic visuals. It’s best for teams and businesses that prioritize speed, professionalism, and brand consistency in their video production workflows.\n\nSynthesia offers a free plan that allows users to generate up to 36 minutes of video per year, with no credit card required. For more extensive features, paid plans start at $29 per month.\n\nRu‎‎nway\n\nRunway is a powerful AI video creation platform packed with features like text-to-video, image-to-video, Motion Brush, Camera Controls, and Inpainting. I’ve mostly used its text-to-video tool to turn simple prompts into visually compelling videos for social media posts.\n\nTools like Motion Brush make it easy to add animations to specific parts of a video, while Camera Controls let you adjust angles and focus for a cinematic feel. The Inpainting feature is particularly impressive, allowing me to seamlessly remove or alter elements in a scene without disrupting the video’s continuity—tasks that usually require advanced skills and fancy video editing software. There is still a bit of a learning curve though, especially for newcomers to video editing.\n\nRunway’s pricing is flexible: the Standard Plan ($12/month) is great for light use, the Pro Plan ($28/month) offers more credits and features, and the Unlimited Plan ($144/month) is ideal for high-output creators or teams. Runway also offers the Basic plan. This plan provides individuals with 125 one-time credits for free. A very light version of Runway is also integrated into Canva so you can try it out there too.\n\nRunway shines for creatives like filmmakers, digital artists, and content creators looking to push boundaries. Though rendering times can occasionally lag for high-resolution videos, the results are worth it. For me, it’s become an essential tool for experimenting and achieving professional-quality outputs, whether for short-form content or storytelling projects.\n\nFi‎lmora\n\nFilmora immediately stood out to me as one of the most user-friendly video editors I’ve tried. Its drag-and-drop functionality and clean interface made it easy to start editing, even without much prior experience. The platform also offers a wide variety of transitions, effects, and templates, which made creating polished videos for YouTube and social media a breeze.\n\nWhat really sets Filmora apart is its impressive range of AI-powered tools. The AI Smart Cutout feature makes isolating objects as easy as painting over them, while the AI Remove Background tool lets you swap out video backgrounds without needing a green screen. I particularly loved the AI Audio Denoise and Silence Detection tools, which helped clean up audio and remove unnecessary pauses to create smoother edits.\n\nThe AI Motion Tracking feature added a fun, creative element to my projects, allowing me to track moving objects for privacy blurring or quirky effects like adding stickers. The AI Audio Stretch tool also came in handy, saving me time by extending background music to perfectly fit scene transitions.\n\nWhile Filmora’s AI tools are convenient and time-saving, they’re not flawless. Features like Smart Cutout and Remove Background sometimes require manual touch-ups, especially for complex scenes. Additionally, rendering can slow down when working with high-resolution files or heavy AI usage, which might be a concern for professional-grade projects.\n\nOverall, Filmora is an excellent choice for creators looking for an affordable, AI-enhanced video editor that simplifies the editing process without sacrificing quality. Whether you’re a hobbyist or a social media creator, it’s a well-rounded option that makes video editing both fun and highly efficient.\n\nFilmora plans start at $49.99 per year or a lifetime license for $79.99. While the free version is handy for testing, it does come with a watermark on exports.\n\nOp‎usClip\n\nOpusClip is a great tool for breaking down longer videos into short, shareable clips for social media. It’s straightforward to use and does a lot of the heavy lifting for you.\n\nThe AI feature is surprisingly effective at finding the best parts of a video, so I didn’t have to spend ages scrubbing through footage. It also resized my clips automatically to fit platforms like TikTok and Instagram.\n\nAdding captions is quick and simple, and the option to throw in emojis makes the clips feel more dynamic—especially useful for grabbing attention in silent scrolling. I also really liked the “hook” feature that picks out key moments to start the clip off strong.\n\nOpus Clip makes it easy to create eye-catching content from videos I’ve already made. It’s practical, efficient, and takes some of the hassle out of social media editing.\n\nThe best AI image generators\n\nGP‎‎T-4o\n\nThe new GPT-4o image generator is seriously impressive. The jump in quality (vs. the previous DALL·E 3 image generation model) is obvious right away. It handles people so much better than before. Faces look realistic, proportions make sense, and even details like posture and lighting often feel intentional. It’s not just spitting out random visual noise anymore. It actually looks like it knows what it's doing.\n\nOne thing that really stood out is how well it generates text. I asked for posters, signs, even labeled diagrams, and most of the time the writing was perfectly readable. That alone makes it way more useful than older versions. It also does a much better job with character consistency, which is something other tools like Midjourney still struggle with.\n\nThat said, it’s not flawless. It still struggles with certain prompts, especially fantasy-related ones like maps or magical creatures. Some filters are still pretty strict. Also, the rollout is kind of all over the place. I got it on my phone but not on desktop at first. But when it works, it’s genuinely exciting. I’ve already started using it for mockups and visuals I used to need Photoshop for.\n\nMi‎‎djourney\n\nMidjourney remains my favorite AI image generator for painterly and imaginative visuals. Its artistic strength lies in its ability to create stunning fantasy and sci-fi imagery or richly textured \"historical\" photos.\n\nOne area where Midjourney shines is in its painterly aesthetic, particularly for faces and intricate details in surreal contexts. I’ve noticed it struggles with rendering faces at a distance, but for speculative and narrative-driven artwork—like a dreamy space opera or a mythical kingdom—Midjourney is unmatched.\n\nFor grounded realism, I rely on DALL-E 3, but when crafting vibrant, otherworldly scenes or highly conceptual art, Midjourney is my go-to tool.\n\nLike DALL-E 3, it lacks the ability to define reusable characters or objects, a feature that would massively enhance its value for consistent visual storytelling.\n\nMidjourney offers both free and premium plans. The free plan allows users to create a small number of images, while the premium plans offers more generations, faster processing, and access to additional tools. The cheapest premium option is the basic plan which cost me $10/month.\n\nThe best AI meeting assistants\n\nFa‎thom\n\n‎Fathom AI Notetaker is the best AI meeting recorder I’ve used. It records meetings seamlessly, generates clear and structured summaries, and provides a full transcript that I can search using AI-powered questions with timestamps for the answers. I save hours each week by not having to rewatch recordings or take notes manually. The summaries are so accurate that they require little to no editing.\n\nThe app is free to use with some limitations. Premium plans start at $19 per month and unlock unlimited AI features along with more integration options. For the price, it is hard to beat, especially with how well it captures questions and action items.\n\nFathom joins meetings reliably and gives me the option to opt out when needed. It even notifies me when I have been talking too long, which is something I never knew I needed but now really appreciate. It's great for client calls, making follow-ups and task tracking effortless. At this point, I cannot imagine handling meetings without it.\n\nNy‎‎ota\n\nNyota is another AI-powered meeting assistant designed to enhance productivity by automating note-taking, task management, and meeting planning.\n\nI connected Nyota to our calendar and it automatically joined scheduled meetings. During meetings, Nyota captured key points, decisions, and action items, allowing me to stay fully engaged in the discussion without the distraction of manual note-taking.\n\nPost-meeting, Nyota provided detailed transcripts and concise summaries, highlighting essential information and assigned tasks. This feature was particularly beneficial for team members who couldn't attend, as they could quickly catch up on critical discussions.\n\nNyota's has some cool meeting planning capabilities. It offered AI-generated suggestions for relevant topics, ensuring our meetings were focused and productive. Additionally, Nyota integrated with our project management tools, automatically creating tasks and updates based on meeting discussions.\n\nWhile Nyota's features were comprehensive, I found that it had a similar issue as tl;dv in that its editing capabilities for transcripts were somewhat limited. Additionally, while Nyota excelled in capturing meeting content, it didn't offer the same depth in post-meeting analytics as some other tools. These analytics typically measure aspects of the meeting, for example if everyone got a chance to speak, which sounds weird but can really help get everyone contributing to the discussion in an unbiased way.\n\nIn comparison to tl;dv, another AI meeting assistant, Nyota provided a more holistic approach by integrating meeting notes with project management tools. While tl;dv focused on transcription and summarization, Nyota's strength lay in its ability to connect meeting insights directly to project tasks and planning.\n\nNyota offers a Starter Plan at $12/month with basic features like meeting note-taking. There's a 7-day free trial.\n\nThe best AI research tools\n\nDe‎ep research\n\nOpenAI's deep research will find, analyze & synthesize hundreds of online sources to create a comprehensive report minutes.\n\nI’ve tested it across multiple domains, and the speed and depth of its insights are unreal—what would normally take me hours, if not days, is now condensed into minutes.\n\nThe tool doesn’t just regurgitate facts; it actually synthesizes information in a way that feels like having a top-tier research assistant. Whether it’s legal analysis, investment reports, or technical breakdowns, it compiles sources, structures findings, and presents a level of clarity that’s hard to match.\n\nThe citation system is solid, though I’ve noticed that in highly specialized fields, it can occasionally misinterpret details, meaning a final manual check is still necessary.\n\nThat said, I don’t think its limitations take away from how powerful it is. It’s especially strong at identifying patterns and connections that might otherwise go unnoticed, making it feel like a true step toward AI-assisted research rather than just an advanced search engine.\n\nSome might argue it’s not \"creating\" new information, but in practice, the way it organizes and presents data often leads to insights I wouldn’t have reached on my own.\n\nThere’s no doubt that tools like this are shifting the way research is done, and while it’s not perfect, it’s the closest thing I’ve seen to an AI that genuinely enhances intellectual work rather than just speeding it up.\n\nThe best AI writing tools\n\nRy‎tr\n\nI’ve used Rytr as an AI writing assistant for generating quick, polished content, and it’s a great alternative when you want something simple and efficient. It’s particularly effective for short-form writing tasks like social media posts, product descriptions, or email drafts. One thing that stands out is its collection of over 40 pre-designed templates, which help structure your content right from the start, saving time when you’re stuck on how to begin.\n\nCompared to ChatGPT, Rytr feels more focused and specialized for writing tasks. While ChatGPT is great for brainstorming and exploring ideas, Rytr is better when you need a ready-to-go format or a professional tone without much back-and-forth. It also comes with a built-in plagiarism checker, giving you peace of mind about originality, and supports over 30 languages, making it ideal for multilingual content creation.\n\nI’ve noticed, however, that Rytr struggles a bit with longer or more complex writing, so it’s not my first choice for in-depth articles. That said, for short-form content, it’s fast, effective, and affordable, with plans starting at just $9/month. If you’re a freelancer, small business owner, or marketer looking for a streamlined tool that gets the job done, Rytr is a solid pick.\n\nSu‎dowrite\n\nI'm an aspiring novelist in my spare time, so I snuck this one into the list.\n\nI’ve been using Sudowrite as a creative writing assistant, and it’s an excellent tool for anyone working on fiction. It’s ideal for overcoming writer’s block, generating fresh ideas, and crafting more vivid narratives. Features like the ‘Describe’ tool, which helps create immersive descriptions, and ‘Brainstorm,’ which sparks creative plot points, have significantly improved my storytelling process. The ‘Expand’ feature is also useful for turning rough outlines into fully developed drafts.\n\nUnlike ChatGPT or Rytr, Sudowrite isn’t designed for creating emails, product descriptions, or blog posts. Its focus is entirely on fiction—helping you write better dialogue, build richer characters, and refine your narrative structure. For instance, when I was stuck on a scene, Sudowrite provided thoughtful suggestions to enhance the pacing and tension. It's the ultimate weapon against writers block - even if you don't end up using what it comes up with, it'll still get you thinking about the next sentence in a different way.\n\nWhile it’s not suitable for business writing or technical content, it’s a fantastic choice for novelists, short story writers, or anyone experimenting with creative projects. With plans starting at $19/month, Sudowrite offers a unique way to elevate your fiction writing.\n\nThe best AI grammar checkers\n\nGr‎ammarly\n\nI've been using Grammarly to enhance my writing for years, and now it has a bunch of AI-powered features. Beyond the usual catching grammar and spelling errors, Grammarly offers tone adjustments, strategic suggestions, and full-sentence rewrites.\n\nGrammarly's new AI writing assistant generates content ideas and assists in drafting emails and documents, and is integrated directly into various platforms, including Gmail, Google Docs, and Microsoft Word, providing real-time suggestions as I write. These integrations have made it easier for me to maintain consistency and professionalism across the different writing tasks I'm faced with on a typical work day.\n\nWhile Grammarly excels in refining and enhancing existing text, it's not designed for generating long-form content from scratch. However, for editing and improving drafts, its AI features are must-have. There's a free version covering basic corrections and a premium plan starting at $30/month.\n\nWo‎rdtune\n\nAnother tool I've been using to refine my writing is Wordtune. Unlike Grammarly, which focuses primarily on grammar and spelling corrections, Wordtune excels in rephrasing sentences to improve clarity, tone, and style.\n\nOne feature I find particularly useful is the ability to switch between formal and casual tones with a single click, allowing me to tailor my writing to different audiences effortlessly. Additionally, Wordtune offers advanced AI proofreading capabilities, ensuring that my spelling, grammar, and phrasing are all spot-on before I hit 'send'.\n\nWordtune also provides contextual suggestions that complement my writing, creating content that perfectly matches my style, tone, and subject matter. This has been invaluable in maintaining consistency across all of my writing.\n\nWhile Wordtune is excellent for rewriting and enhancing existing text, it's not designed for generating long-form content from scratch. However, for editing and improving drafts, it provides some useful features that aren't quite covered by Grammarly. With a free version covering basic features and premium plans starting at $13.99/month, Wordtune offers a range of tools to elevate your writing.\n\nThe best AI search engines\n\nPe‎rplexity\n\nPerplexity is more of a research engine than a search engine. Unlike traditional tools like Google, it doesn’t make you sift through a maze of links—instead, it provides direct answers with citations, making it far more efficient for knowledge work. That said, you still need to verify its responses, as some answers, particularly for technical queries, can rely on outdated information. I’ve seen it cite decade-old sources when I was testing it with some questions about CAD software, which wasn't great.\n\nWhere Perplexity truly stands out is its ability to surface results I wouldn’t have thought to search for. I use it to explore a topic from multiple angles, and its multi-step reasoning engine makes it ideal for in-depth research and synthesis. You can see it automatically detect when an extra search will lead to a better answer and then it starts working through each part of the query step-by-step.\n\nFor those looking for even more functionality, Perplexity Pro is worth checking out. The Pro version costs $20/month and offers faster responses and more detailed answers, significantly improving the overall experience.\n\nThe free version is great for casual use, but if you rely on Perplexity for heavy research, the Pro plan is a solid investment.\n\nCh‎atGPT search\n\nWhat I love about ChatGPT Search is how quick it is. It retrieves information at insane speed, while still offering deliberate reasoning when processing complex queries. This makes it incredibly effective for quickly answering questions or diving into more detailed topics without losing the conversational flow. That's the key point here - it feels like you're having a natural conversation with someone who knows everything.\n\nThere's also an option to ask for more details. Instead of just delivering a single response, ChatGPT Search acts like a guide, helping you explore a subject deeply, clarify concepts, and resolve any doubts. This interactive approach makes it ideal for tackling complex topics or learning in a more intuitive way.\n\nThat said, like all LLM-based search engines, it has its limitations. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stage can sometimes produce subpar results, and the tool has a tendency to justify its search outcomes with certainty—even when they aren’t entirely accurate. For this reason, I always double-check important information.\n\nChatGPT Search is included with premium plans like ChatGPT Plus ($20/month), and it’s a valuable addition for those who need fast, flexible, and deeply interactive search capabilities. It also recently rolled out with limited capabilities for free users too.\n\nThe best AI for social media\n\nVi‎sta Social\n\nI tried using Vista Social to manage our social media accounts, and it's quickly become an indispensable tool. Its comprehensive suite of features allows me to plan, collaborate, and schedule content across all my social channels seamlessly. The visual scheduling and preview capabilities are particularly helpful, enabling me to see exactly how my posts will appear before they go live.\n\nThe AI Assistant leverages ChatGPT to generate engaging captions and message replies and saves a bunch of time. Additionally, the platform's engagement tools consolidate all my social media messages, comments, and reviews in one place, making it easier to keep on top of things and build relationships with our audience. Vista Social also offers robust analytics and reporting tools, allowing me to measure the performance of my campaigns and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nVista Social is ideal for small to medium-sized businesses, marketing agencies, and individual content creators who need a comprehensive, affordable tool for managing social media. However, larger enterprises or teams with complex needs might find its features less robust compared to enterprise-level platforms, especially if they require advanced CRM integration or highly customized analytics.\n\nWith plans starting at $39/month, including planning and publishing tools, engagement features, AI assistance, and detailed reporting, Vista Social offers a lot of value for its price. It’s a user-friendly solution for anyone looking to simplify their social media management process.\n\nFe‎edHive\n\nI also loved FeedHive. Its AI-driven features, like content suggestions and hashtag recommendations, have been particularly useful for brainstorming posts when I’m short on ideas. Scheduling content is a breeze, and the visual previews help me make sure everything looks perfect before it goes live. I also appreciate how easy it is to adjust posts for different platforms within the same interface—it saves so much time.\n\nThe analytics dashboard is another highlight. I’ve used it to track follower activity and post performance, which has helped me identify what resonates most with my audience. FeedHive’s collaboration tools are handy too—I’ve been able to share drafts with my boss and get quick approvals without switching between apps.\n\nThat said, I’ve noticed its social listening capabilities are limited. If you’re looking to monitor brand mentions or trends in real time, you might find it lacking compared to other platforms. Vista Social offers more advanced engagement tools and social listening, though at a higher price point.\n\nFeedHive is lightweight and affordable, starting at $19/month, which makes it a great fit for freelancers and small businesses. It’s been a reliable option for creating and scheduling content, especially if you want something simple yet effective.\n\nThe best AI design tools\n\nCa‎nva Magic Studio\n\nCanva has long been my go-to design tool (because it's so easy to use), and the addition of its AI-powered Magic Studio suite takes it to the next level with a variety of features that simplify and enhance the creative process. These features are:\n\nMagic Design: By inputting a prompt or uploading an image, Magic Design generates personalized templates for various formats like social media posts and presentations. This has been particularly useful when I'm short on inspiration, providing a solid starting point for my social media posts\n\nMagic Write: This tool assists in crafting content by generating text based on your prompts. I've found it helpful for drafting copy and sparking ideas when I have writers block\n\nMagic Edit: Magic Edit allows for seamless modifications within images, such as changing colors or removing elements. It's been invaluable for making quick adjustments without needing to switch to a separate (and more complicated) photo editing tool\n\nMagic Eraser: This feature enables the removal of unwanted objects from images. I've used it to clean up photos before I add them to a social media post\n\nMagic Animate: Magic Animate brings static designs to life by adding animations - great for creating engaging presentations and social media content that capture the attention\n\nRegarding pricing, Canva offers a freemium model. You can try some Magic Studio tools for free, with certain limitations. For instance, Magic Write can be used up to 50 times in total for free. Upgrading to Canva Pro ($15/month) or Canva for Teams ($30/month for 3 seats) increases this limit to 250 times per person, per month.\n\nMagic Studio is ideal for individuals and teams looking to enhance their design capabilities without extensive experience. It's particularly beneficial for small businesses, marketers, and content creators who need to produce high-quality visuals.\n\nLo‎oka\n\nLooka is an AI-powered logo design platform that makes branding simple and effective. I’ve used it for creating a logo for one of my side projects (an Airbnb property management company), and I was very pleased with the results. After entering my project name and choosing styles and colors, Looka generated several options that looked polished and professional. It’s incredibly user-friendly, even if you have zero design experience.\n\nThat's why I love Looka - the simplicity. Once I selected a design I liked, I could easily adjust the fonts, colors, and layouts to fine-tune the final result without feeling overwhelmed. The final logo looked so good that I downloaded the accompanying Brand Kit, which included matching social media templates and business card designs. Having everything ready-to-go saved me hours of extra work.\n\nWhile Looka doesn’t offer the depth of customization you’d get with a professional designer, it’s perfect for small businesses or personal projects where time and cost are important. It’s simple, effective, and delivers great results that I’ve been really happy with.\n\nLooka offers two primary pricing options:\n\nLogo-Only Packages: One-time purchases that include logo files in various formats. The Basic package is priced at $20, while the Premium package costs $65.\n\nBrand Kit Subscriptions: Annual subscriptions providing access to a comprehensive brand kit with over 300 customizable assets. The standard Brand Kit is $96 per year, and the Brand Kit with an AI-generated website is $129 per year.\n\nThe best AI app builders\n\nBo‎lt\n\nGetting a bit more technical now, but if I managed it then you can too! This tool blew me away.\n\nBolt.new is an AI-powered platform that allows you to quickly prototype, run, edit, and deploy full-stack applications directly from your browser. I decided to give it a try by building a simple web application for managing tasks.\n\nBuilding an app on the platform was fast and intuitive. I typed a prompt describing the app—“Build a task manager with a to-do list, user authentication, and a simple dashboard”—and Bolt.new generated a working prototype. From there, I was able to refine the design and functionality using the built-in editor. I added a delete button to each task and adjusted the styling using the code editor and it all seemed to work fine.\n\nWhat I found most impressive was that it can deploy the apps for you. Once I was happy with the app, I clicked “deploy,” and boom, the app was live. The platform handled everything—from hosting to managing serverless functions, it all saved me a ton of time compared to setting up everything manually in a local development environment. It's perfect for prototyping an app.\n\nBolt.new supports frameworks and libraries like React, Next.js, and Vite, so you can probably still use your preferred tech stack. The AI also helped with code generation and debugging to such an extent that I actually didn't use Claude while I was working on my mini-app.\n\nBolt.new isn't the best fit for complex projects that require extensive business logic or integration with third-party services. For more intricate systems or advanced features, you'll still need a real developer.\n\nAll in all, I found Bolt.new to be an excellent tool for quickly building and deploying web applications, especially for rapid prototypes or smaller projects. If you're looking to develop something fast and don't want to worry about managing the backend or hosting, it’s a fantastic option.\n\nBolt.new offers a free plan that provides a daily allocation of 100,000 tokens. The Pro Plan is available at $18 per month, offering 10 million tokens per month.\n\nBu‎bble\n\nIf you don't want to do any coding at all, then Bubble might be a better option. Bubble is a no-code platform that empowers users to build fully functional web applications. To test it out, I tried using it to develop a custom project management tool.\n\nThe platform's drag-and-drop editor allowed me to design the user interface by placing elements like buttons, text fields, and images directly onto the canvas. I could define workflows to specify how the app should respond to user interactions, such as creating tasks or sending notifications. Bubble's built-in database management enabled me to set up data structures and relationships without needing to manage a separate database.\n\nOne feature I found particularly useful was the ability to integrate third-party APIs. For instance, I connected the app to a calendar service to synchronize deadlines, enhancing my tool's usefulness. Bubble also offers a plugin marketplace which really extends the platform's capabilities.\n\nWhile Bubble is powerful, it does still have a learning curve. Understanding how to structure data and workflows effectively took some time. There's a good level of support available via the documentation and community forums, so if you're willing to put some effort in you'll definitely be able to get the results you want.\n\nBubble is an excellent choice for entrepreneurs and small businesses looking to create custom web applications without the need for extensive coding knowledge. I think it's pretty amazing that you can build such a wide range of applications without writing any code whatsoever.\n\nBubble is tailored for users seeking a no-code solution with a focus on visual design and workflow management, whereas Bolt.new leverages AI to provide a more hands-on development experience with full-stack capabilities directly in the browser.\n\nBubble offers a Free Plan that allows users to build and prototype applications without any cost. Their Personal Plan is priced at $32 per month.\n\nLo‎vable\n\nLovable is another no-code AI-powered development platform. As a test I used it to create two projects: a basic CRM and a crypto tracker app.\n\nThe platform's community-driven templates are a highlight. I was able to remix pre-built templates to get a head start, which sped up prototyping significantly. Since any project created on the free tier becomes publicly accessible, there’s a growing library of examples to draw inspiration from.\n\nOne feature I particularly enjoyed was the ability to tweak individual components through focused prompts. For instance, I could select a single button and refine its functionality or style without needing to touch the rest of the app. This made the process feel less overwhelming and great for small adjustments.\n\nI liked the native Supabase integration, which made configuring databases and authentication very simple. Setting up back-end services usually feels like a chore, but Lovable handled it with minimal input on my part.\n\nWhile the free tier is helpful for experimenting, it’s too restrictive for serious use. The $20/month starter tier is much better and gave me enough prompts to complete my projects. That said, if you're not careful with your prompts, it’s easy to burn through your credits quickly. For one of my projects, I ended up using the daily free prompts to make minor fixes after exhausting my monthly quota.\n\nAnother where Lovable could improve is its deployment process. While functional, it doesn’t feel as streamlined as platforms like Bolt.new. Additionally, the lack of a built-in code editor can be frustrating if you want to make manual adjustments. I had to export my code to VS Code to tweak certain elements.\n\nOverall, Lovable is a solid platform for quickly creating functional apps, especially for those who prioritize simplicity and speed over extensive customization. While it’s not perfect, I’m definitely curious to see how it continues to stack up against competitors like Bolt.new in the future.\n\nCu‎rsor\n\nCursor is a cutting-edge AI-powered code editor. The idea of having an AI assist with coding, debugging, and optimization felt like a huge leap forward, so I dove in with high expectations. After using it for a while, I can see why it's so popular, though it’s not without its shortcomings.\n\nThe first thing that stood out to me was how well Cursor handled routine coding tasks. While working on a React project, I asked it to generate functional components, and it delivered clean, efficient code that often included helpful performance tips. Its autocomplete feature felt natural and intuitive, often predicting my intentions before I even finished typing. It saved me a lot of time on repetitive tasks like boilerplate code creation and small adjustments.\n\nI also put its debugging capabilities to the test by feeding it a Python script riddled with errors. Cursor not only pinpointed the issues but explained the solutions clearly and concisely. It felt like having a coding mentor on hand, walking me through my mistakes in a way that boosted my understanding. For newer developers or anyone brushing up on their coding skills, this feature could be incredibly valuable.\n\nBut as I started working on more complex projects, Cursor began to show its limitations. For example, when I tried using it to refactor a tangled mess of legacy JavaScript code, its suggestions didn’t consider the larger structure of my application. Implementing the changes caused other parts of the codebase to break, which made me question its ability to handle context in more intricate systems.\n\nThe Pro version of Cursor, priced at $25 per month, offers access to advanced AI models and priority updates. While the free version is sufficient for casual use, professionals may find themselves needing to upgrade to unlock its full potential. That said, compared to alternatives like GitHub Copilot, Cursor’s pricing feels a bit steep for what it offers.\n\nDespite these issues, Cursor shines in certain scenarios. Its simplicity, speed, and smart suggestions make it an excellent choice for solo developers working on small to medium-sized projects. I found it particularly effective when prototyping ideas or making quick iterations. The clean interface and user-friendly design also make it a great option for beginners looking to learn and get comfortable with coding.\n\nv0‎\n\nv0 is a tool designed for rapid prototyping and code generation. I found it to be a mix of convenience and limitations. While it’s undeniably helpful for getting projects off the ground quickly, it’s not without its quirks—especially for more complex or customized work.\n\nWhat v0 does well is speed. I tried using it to build a basic UI for a React app with Tailwind, and I had a working layout within a few minutes. It’s intuitive and great for laying the foundation of a project. However, its output can feel restrictive if you stray from its default setups like Tailwind or shadcn. The further you deviate, the more time you’ll spend manually adjusting things to fit your vision, which can defeat the purpose of using it for speed.\n\nTo push its capabilities further, I tested v0 on a fun side project—a simple 2D game. It generated a playable prototype almost immediately, which was impressive. When I challenged it to turn the game into 3D, it wasn’t perfect, but it managed to create something workable after a few iterations. It felt like working with a junior developer: fast and capable for basic tasks, but needing guidance for anything more complex.\n\nThat said, v0 has some noticeable limitations. One issue I ran into was its lack of depth in explanations. When I asked it to clarify a specific code snippet, the responses were too surface-level to be truly helpful. If you’re looking for detailed insights or trying to learn from the code, v0 isn’t the best tool for that. It’s better suited for generating quick concepts rather than providing a deep understanding.\n\nAnother drawback is its struggle with edge cases. For example, when I tried to tweak a layout to fit a custom design, v0 couldn’t handle the adjustments without breaking other parts of the structure. Similarly, while it’s great at generating code, I often had to refine and clean up the output to make it more maintainable in the long run.\n\nAt $20 per month, v0’s pricing feels fair if you’re using it regularly for prototyping or small projects. But if your workflow doesn’t rely on tools like Tailwind or you’re already comfortable building things manually, it might not offer enough value to justify the subscription.\n\nDespite its limitations, v0 shines when you need to get something up and running quickly. It’s excellent for getting 80% of the work done in a short amount of time, making it ideal for projects where you just need a functional starting point. It’s also a useful tool for learning or experimenting with ideas you wouldn’t have tackled from scratch.\n\nThe best AI project management tools\n\nAs‎ana\n\nAsana is a comprehensive work management platform designed to help teams plan, track, and manage projects efficiently. It offers a range of tools for task management, project tracking, and team collaboration.\n\nAsana has integrated a number of AI-powered features. One notable addition is the Smart Status feature, which provides quick updates on the status of projects and tasks.\n\nAnother of their AI tools is Smart Chat, an AI-powered assistant that delivers answers to project management questions. This feature has been particularly useful in my experience, as it offers immediate assistance with project-related queries, reducing the time spent searching for information.\n\nAdditionally, Asana has introduced Smart Summaries, which automatically generate concise overviews of tasks and projects, helping teams quickly grasp key information. This feature is great for reviewing project progress and ensuring that all my team members are aligned and informed.\n\nAll of these AI enhancements automate routine tasks and provide valuable insights, allowing me to focus more on the more strategic aspects of project management and less on the admin.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that while Asana offers a robust set of features, some key functionalities are gated behind higher-tier plans, which may be a consideration for teams with budget constraints.\n\nAsana offers a free plan for up to 10 users with basic features. To access the AI features, you'll need the Starter Plan at $13.49 per user per month, which includes all basic features plus AI enhancements.\n\nCl‎ickUp\n\nClickUp is a comprehensive project management platform designed to enhance team collaboration.\n\nUpon signing up, I was greeted with an intuitive interface that allowed me to create tasks, set deadlines, and assign responsibilities with ease. The platform offers various views—such as List, Board, and Calendar—that cater to different project management styles. I found the Board view particularly useful for visualizing task progress, similar to Kanban boards.\n\nClickUp lets me break down projects into subtasks, set priorities, and track time spent on each task. The real-time collaboration feature enabled my team members to comment on tasks, share files, and receive instant notifications about updates. It's all very elegant and calmed my OCD.\n\nThere's loads of nifty little automations you can do. A very simple example is that I set up an automation to move tasks to a \"Completed\" status once all subtasks were checked off. You can get way more complex that than, but it's a good example of how ClickUp's automation features can make everything flow more easily. The platform also integrates with various third-party tools like Slack, Google Drive, and GitHub, which keeps everything nice and neat.\n\nClickUp's AI capabilities assist in drafting project plans, generating meeting agendas, and summarizing documents. I used the AI to draft a project outline, and it provided a structured framework that I could further customize, which was a great help.\n\nClickUp is ideal for teams of all sizes seeking a comprehensive project management solution. Its flexibility makes it suitable for pretty much any project management use case. The platform's scalability ensures it can adapt to both small startups and large enterprises.\n\nClickUps offers a free plan that includes unlimited tasks, docs, and members, with 100MB storage. To access ClickUp's AI features, you'll need to subscribe to a paid plan with the cheapest being the Unlimited Plan at $10 per user per month.\n\nThe best AI scheduling assistants\n\nRe‎claim\n\nReclaim is an AI-powered scheduling assistant that helps optimize your calendar by automatically managing tasks, meetings, and breaks according to your priorities. I started using Reclaim to manage my schedule more effectively, and it’s made a big difference in how I organize my time.\n\nOnce I linked Reclaim to my Google Calendar, I entered all my tasks and meetings, along with their respective priority levels. The AI then adjusted my calendar and automatically assigned time slots for each task. This took a lot of the mental load off my plate and made sure I wasn’t overlooking important commitments.\n\nThe tool identifies the best times for deep work and blocks those hours off to prevent meetings from taking over. This was especially helpful for making sure my most important tasks were tackled without interruptions.\n\nReclaim also helps with scheduling meetings. It automatically finds the best times that work for everyone, taking into account existing events and personal preferences. This made coordinating with my team much easier, saving time that would normally be spent going back and forth on availability.\n\nHowever, there were a few areas where Reclaim could improve. The AI sometimes misinterpreted the priority of certain tasks, which led to less optimal scheduling decisions. Additionally, I found the customization options for categorizing tasks to be a bit limiting.\n\nI found that Reclaim offered a more well-rounded approach by handling both tasks and meetings. Clockwise (more details below) excels at optimizing meeting times, but Reclaim's ability to manage a wider range of events made it more useful overall for my needs.\n\nReclaim offers a Lite Plan at no cost, providing essential smart time-blocking features. The Starter Plan costs $10 per user per month.\n\nCl‎ockwise\n\nClockwise is an AI-powered scheduling assistant designed to optimize your calendar by intelligently managing meetings and creating uninterrupted focus time. Since I began using Clockwise I've found it to be a valuable tool in organizing my workday.\n\nAfter integrating Clockwise with my Google Calendar, I marked certain meetings as flexible. The AI then analyzed my schedule and automatically rescheduled these meetings to create longer blocks of focus time. This adjustment allowed me to dedicate uninterrupted periods to deep work, which had a noticeable impact on the amount of work I got done on a typical day.\n\nClockwise also facilitated easier meeting coordination. It automatically found the best times for meetings, considering all participants' availability and existing commitments. This feature streamlined the scheduling process, reducing the back-and-forth typically involved in finding suitable meeting times.\n\nHowever, I did encounter some limitations. Clockwise makes the same mistake that Relcaim does of occasionally misinterpreting the priority of certain tasks, leading to some wacky scheduling decisions.\n\nIn comparison to Reclaim, another AI scheduling assistant, Clockwise provided a more focused approach by optimizing meeting times and creating focus periods. While Reclaim offered a broader range of features, including task management.\n\nClockwise offers a Free Plan with access to intelligent calendar management features. Their paid plans start at $6.75 per month but you have to pay an annual bill.\n\nThe best AI tools for customer service\n\nTi‎dio AI\n\nTidio is a customer service platform that integrates AI-driven tools.\n\nTidio's main AI feature is the Lyro AI Chatbot, designed to handle up to 70% of customer inquiries. I implemented Lyro to manage common questions and tasks, allowing our human customer service agents to focus on complex issues.\n\nThe chatbot's natural language processing capabilities enabled it to understand and respond to customer queries effectively. For instance, when one of our customers inquired about product specifications, Lyro provided detailed information and resolved the customer's query successfully. This had a hugely positive impact on our response times and customer satisfaction scores.\n\nAnother valuable tool is the Reply Assistant, which leverages GPT-4 technology to transform basic responses into professional, contextually relevant messages. I loved this feature because it improves the quality of our support team's replies. By inputting a simple response, the AI suggested more polished and informative alternatives, ensuring consistent and high-quality communication. This also helped get the team's support for these new AI features as they saw how it was going to supplement their efforts, rather than replace them.\n\nTidio's Smart Views feature offers real-time insights into customer interactions, allowing support agents to prioritize and manage conversations effectively. The ability to see which customers are online and what pages they're viewing enabled proactive engagement, leading to quicker issue resolution.\n\nThe platform also provides comprehensive analytics and reporting tools. I used these to track the performance of AI features, such as response times and customer satisfaction ratings. The data revealed that Lyro handled a significant portion of inquiries, allowing human agents to address more complex cases.\n\nTidio offers a 7-day free trial. Their starter plan at $29/month gives you 50 Lyro AI conversations.\n\nHi‎ver\n\nHiver is an AI-powered customer service platform designed to help teams manage shared inboxes like support and sales emails. I started using Hiver to streamline our team’s email management and improve our customer service response times. The integration with Gmail made it very easy to adopt.\n\nOne feature I found particularly useful was the AI Summarizer. With a lot of email threads piling up, it can be time-consuming to read through long chains of emails to get to the key points. The AI Summarizer condenses these conversations into quick, digestible summaries, highlighting the most important details like decisions, tasks, and follow-ups. This feature helped me stay on top of conversations without getting bogged down by lengthy threads. It’s a huge time-saver, especially when handling multiple customer inquiries simultaneously.\n\nAnother tool I appreciated was the AI Bot – Harvey, which automatically filters out redundant or low-priority emails, such as auto-replies or basic queries that don’t require much attention. It helped keep our inbox cleaner and allowed me and my colleagues to focus on the more complex requests. We saw a noticeable reduction in our average query handling time because of this feature.\n\nThe Analytics and Reporting tools were another highlight for me. I was able to easily track our performance with metrics like response times, customer satisfaction ratings, and the volume of tickets handled by the AI bot. This insight was valuable for identifying areas where we could improve and optimizing how we allocate tasks between the AI and our human team members.\n\nThat said, while Hiver is a powerful tool, I did find that there were times when the AI Summarizer missed some nuances in long email threads, requiring a manual review. Additionally, while Harvey was great at filtering out simpler inquiries, it occasionally flagged some queries as redundant that actually required attention, which led to some minor delays.\n\nI loved this platform, but I still see room for more flexibility in customizing the AI’s decision-making process, especially when it comes to complex inquiries. Overall, Hiver has been incredibly helpful in improving how we manage customer support emails. It saved me time by automating repetitive tasks and helped our team focus on delivering better, more personalized support.\n\nHiver’s Free Plan includes 1 shared inbox and basic features like live chat and knowledge base. The Lite Plan at $24 per user/month adds 2 shared inboxes, light automation, analytics, and integrations.\n\nThe best AI tools for recruitment\n\nTe‎xtio\n\nTextio is an AI-powered platform designed to enhance the quality and inclusivity of recruitment communications, particularly job postings. I began using Textio to improve some job descriptions for open positions we have on our team and found it to be a valuable tool in attracting a diverse pool of candidates.\n\nI found particularly useful was the Textio Score, which evaluates the effectiveness of the language used in job postings. It provides a numerical score indicating how likely the posting is to attract diverse applicants. The score is based on a number of factors and by adjusting the language based on Textio's suggestions, I was able to improve the score, leading to a more inclusive and appealing job description.\n\nWhile some tools offer features like resume screening or candidate matching, Textio's emphasis on crafting effective and unbiased job postings provides a unique advantage in attracting a diverse talent pool.\n\nTextio offers a 14-day free trial for users to explore its platform.\n\nCV‎ViZ\n\nCVViZ is an AI-powered recruitment platform designed to streamline the hiring process by automating tasks such as job posting, resume screening, and candidate engagement. I found it to be a valuable tool in attracting and selecting qualified candidates.\n\nCVViZ gives you the ability to automate job postings across multiple platforms. By integrating with over 2,000 job boards worldwide, CVViZ allows you to publish job ads to 20+ free and 1,700+ paid job sites with a single click.\n\nCVViZ intelligently matches and ranks resumes, helping you identify the best candidates early in the recruitment process. When we tried it out for a role we're hiring for on our team, CVViZ highlighted top candidates based on their alignment that actually looked like decent candidates.\n\nThe platform offers tools to engage and track candidates effectively. It enables you to communicate with candidates, schedule interviews, and make job offers within the system. CVViZ is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), acting as an intelligent layer on top of your current recruitment management system.\n\nThe platform provides detailed analytics and reporting features, offering insights into sourcing channels, team performance, and time-to-fill metrics.\n\nCVViZ offers a 7-day free trial. Their Starter Plan is available at $99 per month.\n\nThe best AI knowledge management tools\n\nNo‎tion AI Q&A\n\nNotion AI Q&A is a powerful tool that allows users to access a company's knowledge base across thousands of Notion pages. I first started using it in my new job, and it quickly became one of my favorite AI tools.\n\nAs an introvert, having the ability to ask any question (without bothering anyone) and instantly receive a detailed, accurate answer—powered by the collective knowledge stored across the company's Notion workspace—was incredibly empowering. It felt like having a personal assistant who could provide information from all corners of the company at any time.\n\nNotion AI Q&A is especially valuable compared to tools like Google Drive search. It doesn’t just give you links to documents but actually provides relevant answers pulled directly from the content, making it much quicker to get to the heart of a question. This saved me countless hours when I needed quick answers to detailed inquiries.\n\nHowever, while the desktop experience is smooth, I’ve faced some frustrating issues on Android, particularly with my Pixel 8 running Android 14. The app tends to freeze, lag, or glitch quite a bit, making it difficult to rely on it when I’m on the go. Or I could just buy an iPhone I suppose.\n\nOne other negative is the pricing. Notion AI is priced as an add-on feature, costing $10 per member each month ($8 when paying annual), which is quite reasonable given the benefits, but can add up pretty quickly if you are a big team. I still think it's worth it though.\n\nFor companies with large internal knowledge bases, I think Notion AI Q&A is an essential tool for simplifying information retrieval and making knowledge accessible to everyone, regardless of their role or level of expertise.\n\nGu‎ru\n\nGuru is an AI-powered knowledge management platform designed to centralize and streamline access to company information. In my experience, integrating Guru into our workflow significantly enhanced our team's efficiency and collaboration. Guru integrates with Slack, Teams, Salesforce, and pretty much every other platform you can think of.\n\nUpon implementation, Guru allowed us to access verified knowledge directly within our communication channels, reducing the need to switch between platforms. The AI-powered search functionality was particularly impressive, delivering relevant information based on context, history, role, and location.\n\nGuru's AI Training Center, enabled us to review and improve AI-generated answers, ensuring accuracy and relevance.\n\nThe platform's verification system ensured that the information we accessed was up-to-date and reliable. Automated reminders prompted subject matter experts to keep content fresh, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.\n\nGuru is ideal for teams seeking a comprehensive knowledge management solution that integrates seamlessly with existing workflows. The downside is that it's a bit pricey at $15/user/month - almost double what Notion AI costs.\n\nThe best AI email assistants\n\nHu‎bSpot AI Email Writer\n\nHubSpot offers an AI-powered email assistant designed to kickstart your creative juices and help write up personalized emails at scale. The platform’s AI assistant generates copy fit for various email campaigns, like sales outreach, marketing newsletters, and so on.\n\nYou can then edit or repurpose generated drafts by automatically changing their tones as well as lengthening or shortening them. HubSpot also includes a drag-and-drop email template builder with numerous customizable use-case-specific presets, perfect for further streamlining creative processes.\n\nWhat I found most useful is that HubSpot’s AI email writer links with the platform’s CRM database. That means you can roll out email campaigns and automatically log conversations to your contact lists. From there, you can track progress and send out follow-ups at the right time to maximize response rates. Plus, you can use the platform’s AI assistant directly from your Gmail account, which spares you the need to juggle between multiple tabs.\n\nHubSpot’s AI Email Writer is a solid choice for busy marketing and sales teams looking to scale up their efforts and maximize results without increasing headcount.\n\nThe email writing assistant is available for free, while more advanced email functionalities are available throughout HubSpot’s Marketing Hub paid packages. Pricing starts at $15 per month.\n\nSa‎neBox\n\nSaneBox is an AI-driven email management tool designed to help users declutter their inboxes by intelligently sorting incoming emails.\n\nSetting up Sanebox involved connecting it to my Gmail account, and then the service began analyzing my email habits to categorize incoming messages. It created folders such as SaneLater for less urgent emails and SaneBlackHole for unwanted senders. This initial configuration required minimal effort and was completed within minutes.\n\nSaneBox's AI effectively filtered emails based on my past interactions. Important messages from frequent contacts appeared in my main inbox, while newsletters and promotional emails were directed to the SaneLater folder.\n\nBeyond sorting, SaneBox offers features like snoozing emails and setting reminders for follow-ups. The snooze function allowed me to temporarily remove non-urgent emails from my inbox and have them return at a more convenient time. The reminder feature ensured I followed up on important emails, preventing tasks from slipping through the cracks.\n\nWhile SaneBox significantly improved my email organization, there were a few drawbacks. The service occasionally misclassified emails, directing important messages to the SaneLater folder. Additionally, I can imagine that the daily digest of filtered emails could be overwhelming, especially during periods of high email volume.\n\nOverall, SaneBox offers a comprehensive suite of features that go beyond basic filtering. Its AI-driven approach to email sorting and additional functionalities like snoozing and reminders make managing your inbox more efficient and less stressful.\n\nSaneBox offers a 14-day free trial. After the trial, the Snack Plan at $7 per month provides access to two features on a single email account.\n\nSh‎ortwave\n\nShortwave is an AI-powered email client with features such as AI email summarization, language translation, and task management.\n\nAfter connecting it to my Gmail account, the application began analyzing my email history to provide personalized AI assistance.\n\nShortwave main feature is AI email summarization. The AI assistant provided concise summaries of lengthy email threads, enabling me to grasp key points without reading through extensive conversations. I don't really handle that many emails in my job, but I can imagine it would be particularly beneficial for someone in a sales or outreach role where it would do a lot to reduce the cognitive load of reading and processing so many conversations.\n\nShortwave's language translation feature translated emails accurately, preserving the context and tone of the original message. The tool also has some handy functional that lets me convert emails into tasks, set reminders, and track progress without leaving the application.\n\nWhile I was impressed with Shortwave, the AI assistant occasionally misinterpreted the context of certain emails, leading to less accurate summaries or translations. Nevertheless, it's a comprehensive suite of features (AI summarization, translation, and task management) within a single platform.\n\nShortwave offers a free plan which includes basic email management features like AI assistance, 90 days of searchable email history, and inbox customization. Their personal plan costs $8.50 per seat/month.\n\nThe best AI presentation makers\n\nGa‎mma\n\nGamma is an AI-powered presentation tool that has made creating professional slides much easier.\n\nI gave it a try and I was impressed by how quickly it generated clean, visually appealing slides from simple prompts. What stood out immediately was the design quality. The AI handled the layout and formatting, allowing me to focus more on the content itself. I didn’t need to worry about alignment, colors, or fonts—Gamma took care of all of that.\n\nWhile the design of the slides looks great, I did find some limitations in the editing features. Gamma’s customization options, especially when it comes to modifying layouts and slide elements, felt somewhat restrictive. For example, while I could adjust text and add media, fine-tuning certain parts of the design (like moving text boxes or resizing elements) wasn’t as easy as I would have liked. I also noticed that the templates, though beautiful, are somewhat limiting if you want to move away from their general style or structure.\n\nDespite these limitations, it's a great choice for users who need to put together polished presentations without spending hours on design details.\n\nThe Free Plan offers 400 AI credits, basic image generation, and the ability to create up to 10 slides per presentation. The Plus Plan at $10/user/month includes unlimited AI creation, advanced image tools, more slides, and priority support.\n\nPr‎esentations.ai\n\nPresentations.ai is another AI-powered platform designed to simplify the creation of professional presentations.\n\nI would say that I found the visual appeal of the slides generated by this tool are pretty comparable with the slides generated by Gamma - there's not much in it.\n\nBoth tools also have real time collaboration features, enabling multiple users to work on the same presentation simultaneously.\n\nOne advantage that I found with Presentations.ai is that it aligned the generated presentation with my corporate brand and theme more closely than Gamma did. The slides that Gamma generated probably needed a bit more tinkering in this regard.\n\nPresentations.ai currently offers a Starter Plan for free (limited-time Early Bird pricing) with features like limited AI credits, team collaboration, basic functionality, and seamless sharing. For more advanced needs, the Pro Plan is available at $198 per user per year, providing additional AI credits, pro templates, custom fonts and colors, analytics, and PDF export.\n\nThe best AI resume builders\n\nTe‎al\n\nTeal is an AI-powered resume builder that helps me refine and optimize my resume. As someone who’s worked on my resume multiple times, I’ve always found it a bit tedious to get everything right, especially with the constant need to tailor it for specific job applications. I was curious to see how Teal could help speed up the process while ensuring my resume stood out.\n\nI added my job history, skills, and career goals and I was shown a live preview of the resume and Teal generated relevant bullet points based on my experience. For example, when I entered my previous role in marketing, the AI suggested action-oriented phrases like \"increased engagement by 30%\" or \"managed a team of 5,\" which gave my resume a polished, results-oriented feel right from the start. It saved me a lot of time and brainpower, as I didn’t have to come up with the right words or phrasing.\n\nTeal lets you import a job description, and it then tailors your resume by suggesting key skills and experience you might want to highlight. I tested this by uploading a marketing manager role I was interested in, and Teal highlighted key phrases from the job description and suggested how to incorporate them into my resume. It felt like a great way to ensure my resume was tailored for the position I was applying for without much extra work.\n\nTeal also provided real-time feedback on my resume. It gave suggestions like \"add more measurable achievements\" or \"use more action verbs,\" which I found really helpful. These suggestions made it clear where I could improve my resume, even if the content was technically correct. For example, I had some bullet points that didn’t really show the impact of my work, and Teal helped me reframe those to highlight results more effectively.\n\nThere are a couple of things that could be better. The AI, while quite helpful, wasn’t perfect. A few of the suggested phrases felt too generic and didn’t fully capture the nuances of my role. I had to tweak some of them to better reflect my personal contributions. Additionally, while there are a lot of customization options, I felt that some of the design templates were a bit too limited for my taste. I’d love to have more flexibility with fonts or section layouts to match my personal style.\n\nTeal offers a Free Plan that includes unlimited resumes and job tracking. The Teal+ Plan is available for $29 per month and gives you unlimited access to all the other features.\n\nKi‎ckresume\n\nKickresume is an AI-powered resume builder designed to assist users in creating professional and tailored resumes efficiently. The platform offers various templates and design options.\n\nKickresume's AI-driven content suggestions are super helpful. After I added the job title and job description/responsibilities, the AI proposed relevant bullet points and achievements. One of the most time-consuming aspects of applying for jobs is customizing your resume for the specific role, which typically involves highlighting a specific achievement or project that you have worked on. By analyzing the job description, Kickresume suggests relevant skills and experiences to include, enhancing the resume's alignment with the desired position. I found the AI suggestions were almost always helpful.\n\nKickresume also provides real-time feedback on the content and formatting of the resume. The platform highlights areas that may require improvement, such as keyword optimization and alignment with job descriptions.\n\nKickresume offers a Free Plan with basic resume and cover letter templates, a personal website template, and access to 20,000 pre-written phrases. For more features, the Monthly Plan at $19/month includes premium templates, unlimited customization, an AI resume checker, and priority support.\n\nThe best AI voice generators\n\nEl‎evenLabs\n\nElevenLabs is widely seen as the leading AI voice generator. It offers text-to-speech and voice cloning capabilities.\n\nThe voice quality is very high. I tested it by converting some text into speech, and the AI-generated voice sounded incredibly natural. It captured human intonation and rhythm much more effectively than I expected. I could also adjust parameters like pitch, speed, and tone, which gave me more control over how the voice would sound.\n\nI uploaded a sample of my own voice to the voice cloning feature, and it generated a model that closely resembled my speech patterns. I tested it by inputting my own text, and it sounded almost identical to my original recording. I did notice some slight differences in tone at times, but it was still incredibly accurate.\n\nI also tried integrating ElevenLabs with a text-to-speech application, which allowed me to seamlessly convert written content into spoken words. This is particularly useful for accessibility purposes or for anyone who prefers consuming content in audio format.\n\nWhile ElevenLabs does offer impressive features, there are a few areas for improvement. The AI-generated voices sometimes require minor adjustments for more precise tonal nuances. The customization options, though extensive, can feel a bit restrictive for more specific needs or highly specialized voices.\n\nI should also mention ElevenLabs AI Dubbing Studio, which really impressed me with its ability to create voiceovers and dub content in multiple languages. I uploaded a video and was able to quickly generate high-quality voiceover tracks in different voices and accents. It's a bit pricey, and there's no video dubbing/lip-sync capabilities (for that, check out Synthesia's AI video dubbing), but otherwise I thought it was a pretty neat extra set of features and it's definitely one of my favourite video translation apps.\n\nElevenLabs offers a free plan that gives you 10k credits (10 mins of text-to-speech). Their Starter Plan costs $5/month and gives you 30k credits (30 mins) along with voice cloning and Dubbing Studio access.\n\nMu‎rf\n\nI recently started using Murf AI for generating voiceovers for a few content creation projects. Specifically, I needed to produce voiceovers for explainer videos I was working on. The goal was to save time while still achieving high-quality, professional-sounding audio without having to record everything manually.\n\nI created an account and uploaded a script for my first video. I was able to choose from a wide selection of voices, including male and female options, in various accents and languages. The user interface is intuitive, and I found myself able to jump straight into the process without needing a tutorial.\n\nOne of the things I loved was how realistic the voices sounded. I tested several options and was impressed with how well the AI mimicked natural speech patterns. The intonation and rhythm were particularly good for a text-to-speech system. I used the voice that best matched the tone of the video, and it gave me a finished product that sounded professional and clear. It felt like a voiceover artist had recorded it, without the need for studio time (and $).\n\nMurf allows you to adjust parameters like pitch, speed, and tone. This was a huge help in fine-tuning the delivery of the lines. For example, I wanted a slightly more upbeat tone for the intro of the video, and Murf allowed me to make these adjustments easily.\n\nAnother feature I tried was the voice cloning tool, which allows you to create a replica of your own voice. I uploaded a short sample of my voice to test this, and the system generated a voice model that was surprisingly accurate. This feature could be useful for personalizing voiceovers, particularly if you want your own voice to appear in various content without having to record it each time.\n\nWhile I was generally impressed, I did encounter a couple of limitations. For instance, when I tested the AI-generated voice for more complex sentences, there were occasional mispronunciations or unnatural pauses. In these cases, I found it helpful to manually tweak the text or use Murf’s editing features to smooth things over. It would be ideal if the system could handle these nuances automatically, but it’s still a very solid tool overall.\n\nFor my particular project, Murf saved me a ton of time. Instead of recording my own voice for every line, I could focus more on the creative aspects of my video and use Murf to handle the bulk of the audio. I also found it useful when I needed to quickly create multiple versions of the same script—adjusting for different audiences or purposes without re-recording the entire voiceover.\n\nMurf offers a Free Plan with 10 minutes of voice generation and transcription, access to 120+ voices, and basic audio/video sharing. The Creator Plan at $29/month includes unlimited downloads, access to 200+ voices, 2 hours of voice generation per month, and commercial usage rights.\n\nThe best AI music generators\n\nSu‎no\n\nSuno is an AI-powered music generator that allows users to create songs by inputting text prompts. I entered a prompt describing the mood and genre I desired—a melancholic piano ballad—and Suno produced a complete song with vocals and instrumentation. The AI's ability to interpret and translate textual descriptions into musical compositions is pretty mind blowing.\n\nI found my generated song to be surprisingly coherent and emotive. The vocals, while synthetic, conveyed the intended melancholy, and the piano arrangement complemented the mood effectively. However, there were moments where the lyrics felt slightly repetitive, and the vocal delivery lacked some human nuances.\n\nSuno offers limited editing capabilities. I attempted to adjust the tempo and key, but the options were somewhat constrained. For more intricate modifications, external audio editing software would be necessary.\n\nDespite the editing limitations, I found the experience enjoyable and plan to use Suno again for generating quick musical ideas or exploring different genres. My most frequent use case for Suno is background music for social media posts and videos, and it's really great for that.\n\nAI-generated music is gaining traction, with platforms like Suno making it accessible to a broader audience. But while AI can produce impressive compositions, it currently lacks the depth and emotional complexity of human-created music. I think it will be a while yet until we're listening to AI-generated music for pleasure.\n\nSuno offers a Free Plan with 50 daily credits for up to 10 song generations per day, suitable for personal and non-commercial use. The Pro Plan at $10/month provides 2,500 credits per month, commercial use rights, priority generation, and the ability to run up to 10 tasks simultaneously.\n\nBe sure to get the Pro Plan if you want to use Suno like I do for social media posts and videos, as you'll need the commercial license.\n\nUd‎io\n\nTo test Udio, I wanted to create an upbeat, electronic track with a strong bassline and catchy melodies, so I fed it a prompt describing the vibe I was aiming for.\n\nThe track had a solid structure, with a clear intro, build-up, and drop. The synths were vibrant and energetic, and the rhythm section had a groove that made the track feel engaging.\n\nOne thing that sets Udio apart from Suno is its approach to genre-specific customization. Udio offers a more direct way of shaping the style of the music based on the prompt you give it. For example, I could request specific instruments or even ask for a particular type of electronic subgenre. While the song was definitely listenable and had the vibe I wanted, it wasn’t without limitations. The vocals, while fitting, still felt a bit robotic.\n\nEditing options in Udio are also a bit more flexible than Suno, but still not at the level of traditional music production software.\n\nUdio offers a Free Plan with 100 credits per month for up to 50 song generations and basic music creation tools. For more credits you'll need the Standard Plan which costs $10/month.\n\nThe best AI marketing tools\n\nAd‎Creative\n\nAdCreative is an AI-powered platform that simplifies the process of creating ad creatives for platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Google Ads. After spending some time using it, I found it to be a convenient tool that saves time and delivers professional results, though it does have some limitations depending on your goals.\n\nAdCreative is super easy to use. I entered details about my campaign—like the product and target audience—and the tool generated several polished ad designs tailored to different platforms. The designs followed current advertising trends, making them ready to use with only minor adjustments. For someone like me without a design background this tool really opens up a lot of ad options.\n\nI could easily tweak the text, replace images, and add my logo to align the ads with my branding. The interface is intuitive and beginner-friendly, so even with limited design experience, I felt confident editing the outputs.\n\nOne feature that stood out was the ability to generate multiple ad variations for A/B testing. AdCreative made it simple to produce different versions of an ad with variations in headlines or visuals. This was a huge time-saver and perfect for campaigns that require constant testing and optimization.\n\nThere are some drawbacks. When working with niche products, I noticed the designs sometimes lacked creativity and felt a bit generic. While the tool is great for creating clean, professional-looking ads, it struggles to bring a unique or artistic flair to campaigns that require a more distinctive touch. This may not be an issue for standard e-commerce products, but it’s a limitation for brands looking to stand out with highly original concepts.\n\nAnother area where the tool fell short was copywriting. While it provides suggestions for ad headlines and descriptions, the text often felt formulaic and uninspired. I frequently had to rewrite the copy or ask ChatGPT to offer some ideas that better match my brand’s tone and messaging.\n\nAdCreative’s pricing is reasonable for frequent users, starting at $39/month, which is far more affordable than hiring a designer. However, for occasional users, the cost may feel less justified, especially if the outputs require significant manual adjustments.\n\nThe best AI sales tools\n\nCl‎ay\n\nClay is a powerful lead generation platform that simplifies prospecting by automating data collection, enrichment, and scoring. After testing it across multiple campaigns, I found it to be a valuable tool for advanced users, though it comes with a learning curve and isn’t a perfect fit for everyone.\n\nIf you’re unsure what Clay does, think of it as a powerful mega-spreadsheet that seamlessly integrates with hundreds of data sources. It allows you to organize all your prospects' information, their details, and the emails you plan to send—all in one place.\n\nTo test the platform I tried creating a prospect list by defining parameters like job titles and company size. Clay saved me hours of manual research by returning an enriched dataset with detailed insights. Its lead scoring feature was helpful, enabling me to prioritize high-value leads based on how well they aligned with my campaign objectives.\n\nBe warned, the setup process can be intimidating for less tech-savvy users, and it took me some time to fully grasp how to make the most of its features. The platform can be tricky to navigate, and without proper knowledge, you risk wasting your credits—and by extension, your money.\n\nFor those interested, Clay offers a free version for small-scale testing. Its paid plans range from $149 to $800 per month, with higher-tier options providing better savings on credit costs for heavy users.",
      "# [5 AI creative writing tools by David Burton on 2024-08-16](https://www.artshub.co.uk/news/features/5-ai-creative-writing-tools-2617465/)\nIf you’re ready to embrace the technological future, there’s a diverse range of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for creative writers available. While it’s feasible that AI could write your masterpiece for you, it probably won’t become the next literary award-winner. Overall, AI tools are best used as a means of generating ideas or first drafts, or correcting prose. Embraced in this way, AI can streamline your creative writing process.\n\nWhen considering these tools, it’s essential to know if the work you generate on the platforms will be used to train further AI models or possibly used in ways you didn’t intend. For more on the ethics of creative AI, take a look at the Senate inquiry into AI in Australia, and what concerns by the sector were tabled.\n\nGrammarly\n\nOne of the world’s most popular grammar checkers, Grammarly recently rebranded itself as AI writing assistance. Apart from offering a robust service for basic punctuation and grammar mistakes, Grammarly can use AI to check the tone of your writing and make suggestions. Ideal for professional emails and documents, Grammarly is also rare in its meaningful integration with Office 365 and most internet browsers.\n\nSudowrite\n\nIf nothing else, Sudowrite is a fun toy to play with. Sudowrite is designed for fiction writers. It’s in-browser app has a range of tools, including brainstorming names or locations. But its real thrill is in its Story Bible tool. It will take your unrefined brain dump and turn it into a synopsis, an outline, a chapter and a character breakdown. From there, it can generate a beat-by-beat summary for each chapter and even write it for you.\n\nYou can provide edits and nudges in the desired direction at each step. Sudowrite feels the most like the creative writing techno-dystopia that keeps editors and authors up at night. Still, when handled properly, it is most like a helpful, occasionally dim-witted co-writer. Sudowrite’s pricing is aggressive: a monthly subscription will net you a dedicated amount of AI hints, but you will need to pay extra if you run out. Writing an entire chapter, for example, is an expensive enterprise.\n\nJasper\n\nTaking the lead in blog writing, marketing copy and social media posts, Jasper is constructed to help an organisation with content marketing. It leverages your company’s established brand voice and style guide to begin generating content. It can build a content strategy for you, or work off one you have already created. You can use the Jasper app in-browser, but you can also use the Jasper API directly into code. Many other SEO (search engine optimisation) and content generation AI creative writing tools offer slight variants. Jasper remains one of the most popular.\n\nProWritingAid\n\nGeared towards journalists, academics and authors, ProWritingAid offers unique insight on your early drafts. It is not designed for content generation, but will offer a customised critique of your work, describing strengths, weaknesses and areas for improvement. Fiction writers can receive custom suggestions on plot enhancement, characters, setting and pace. It will also shorten or expand sections while maintaining your authorial voice. Among the spectrum of AI creative writing tools, it is also relatively inexpensive.\n\nRytr",
