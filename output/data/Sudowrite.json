The short answer is, Sudowrite won't plagiarize unless you explicitly force it to plagiarize, which is against our terms of service.\n\nThe AI works by guessing one word at a time, based on general concepts it has learned from billions of samples of text. So it's extremely unlikely to produce the same words verbatim, or even ever again.

Sudowrite is a tool for creativity. It's not intended to write for you, but can help you vastly improve and speed up your writing. Just as a great writing partner can help you bust through when you're stuck or be a sounding board to bounce ideas off of, Sudowrite makes writing more fun, faster, and less solitary.\n\nWhat public language models does Sudowrite use? We use over two dozen AI models, including Claude 2 by Anthropic, multiple open models, and several variants of GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, transformer models created by OpenAI. OpenAI trained their models on: (1) a version of the CommonCrawl dataset, filtered based on similarity to high-quality reference corpora, (2) an expanded version of the Webtext dataset, (3) two internet-based book corpora, and (4) English-language Wikipedia. We pair these models with a variety of proprietary narrative model-based and algorithmic pre- and post-processing to enable AI writing features not available anywhere else.\n\nDoes Sudowrite learn and improve from my writing?

The idea of using AI and ML to generate text has been floating around since the '60s (shoutout to ELIZA). And the modern era of AI writing tools has been in full swing since the release of GPT-3 aaaall the way back\n\nHow to Write a Book with ChatGPT (+ a Better Alternative)\n\nIf you‚Äôre thinking about writing a book with AI, ChatGPT is probably pretty tempting. It‚Äôs free (or, at the very least, cheap), crazy smart, and able to adapt to any prompt you throw at it. Well‚Ä¶ almost any prompt. If you head over to ChatGPT and write: * ‚ÄúGenerate",

      "# [We‚Äôre hiring one amazing human to lead community at Sudowrite](https://editor.sudowrite.com/jobs-community/)\nDo you love community strategy & metrics as much as you love writing? Are you energized by helping, welcoming, and empowering others? Then read on...\n\nAI: It‚Äôll either kill us all or create a utopian renaissance situation like the world has never seen.\n\nWe‚Äôre working really hard to make sure it‚Äôs the latter.\n\nWe make this thing called Sudowrite. It‚Äôs the best tool for long-form writers ever made. Over 8,000 authors use it to publish novels, screenplays, short stories, and lots of other things.\n\nOur writers tell us it helps them write 2-3√ó as fast, get unblocked, and finish novels that had languished for years. If G.R.R. Martin had this thing, book six would have been out years ago.\n\nWe‚Äôre growing fast. We 5Xed revenue and customers in the last six months. We have something real here.\n\nWe‚Äôre üí• profitable üí•. We‚Äôve hit product-market fit and now we‚Äôre just trying to keep up with demand. Our team is small (just 5) and we‚Äôre all really good at what we do. We‚Äôve been featured in The New Yorker and lots of other places you‚Äôve heard of. Just last month, a book written using Sudowrite was reviewed in the New York Times.\n\nOur company was started by repeat founders, both writers, both down-to-earth, decent people with prior exits. Our investors aren‚Äôt too shabby, either.\n\nIf you‚Äôve played the startup game before, you know that nothing in life is certain. That said, we have strong fundamentals, we believe AI is here to stay, and our business is working.\n\nOur community is core to our success. In fact, the vast majority of people find us through word of mouth.\n\nAuthors hear about us in discords and slacks and facebook groups and subreddits. We have a friendly Slack community with over 3,500 people. Every day, members help each other learn how to use the Sudowrite.\n\nWe have a fledgling ambassadors program with volunteers from all over the world. They hold Zoom sessions to help other authors, answer questions in Slack, and document best practices. They are amazing.\n\nWe also build features with dozens and sometimes hundreds of community members giving feedback directly to our product team. We talk to and learn from our customers daily.\n\nCommunity isn‚Äôt a nice-to-have, it‚Äôs part of our product.\n\nWe want our community to become THE reason people choose to join Sudowrite. We want a supportive, ambitious, and vibrant community that is as much the product as the app itself.\n\nThese days, Ryan (our designer) runs weekly community calls, teaches classes on how to use Sudowrite, and works with our ambassadors.\n\nJames (one of our founders) and Josh (one of our engineers) worked closely with hundreds of community testers to build our newest feature.\n\nAmit (the other founder) actively answers questions about sudowrite on reddit and facebook, and is helping with ambassadors.\n\nAnd all of us actively answer questions in the community Slack and solicit feedback.\n\nWe believe a stronger community = a stronger business\n\nWe believe great stories change minds & thus change the world.\n\nWe believe tools like Sudowrite are enabling a creative renaissance.\n\nWe believe learning from and supporting each other is the key to making this all work.\n\nWe believe a stronger community directly leads to a stronger business.\n\nHere‚Äôs where\n\nyou come in‚Ä¶\n\nWe want a visionary, compassionate, detail-oriented do-er who can own all aspects of community. Someone who loves trying new things, moves quickly, and wakes up each morning energized by this stuff.\n\nRight now, we believe community encompasses talking with current and future customers, content marketing, and program management, but this may evolve as we learn more about what our community members need most.\n\nWhat you‚Äôll do\n\nWork directly with our founders to create, then own our community strategy\n\nEstablish and monitor key metrics + reporting systems representing our community health\n\nGrow our community and optimize the funnel from community to customer\n\nOversee and improve our educational system - including live classes and youtube videos\n\nOversee content - including docs, blogs, emails, and collaborating with external content creators\n\nGrow our ambassador program - empowering our best writers to share their gifts\n\nFacilitate community involvement in product decisions\n\nMaintain a great vibe in our community spaces\n\nMaintain presence wherever writers talk about us - facebook, discords, subreddits, etc. (up for discussion)\n\nThis is your dream job if you‚Ä¶\n\nLive and breathe community and care deeply about people\n\nBring a quantitative mindset to community growth\n\nLove to set and deliver on ambitious goals\n\nLove to write and have participated in writer communities\n\nAre motivated by our mission and vision for the future\n\nAre able to manage multiple projects with high attention to detail\n\nRequired experience\n\n4-6 years of community experience\n\nExperience growing an early customer base or community\n\nThings you may have done\n\nBuilt an online community with over 1000 members\n\nRun online or in-person events\n\nOperated a writing community, workshop, or taught writing\n\nBeen part of the early growth stage of a successful startup in a growth, marketing, product, community management, or operations role\n\nOther things to know\n\nRemote-first- We‚Äôre fully and unapologetically remote. Heck, no two people even live in the same city. We meet up a few times a year, the last few times in Yosemite üèû , the Hudson valley üóΩ, and Hawaii üå¥. We hang out on Zoom on Thursdays and have a monthly book club.\n\nWork-life balance- We don‚Äôt expect you to spend 80 hours a week at your desk, and we don‚Äôt plan to, either. Sometimes things get busy, but it shouldn‚Äôt be the norm. We have lives outside of work, and we want you to as well.\n\nCompetitive compensation & benefits- We‚Äôll pay you 110K base salary and 0.4% equity or $80K salary and 0.5% equity. We‚Äôll help you set up your home office, and you‚Äôll have good health and dental insurance and unlimited paid time off (vacation, sick, holidays). Also, all the books you want.\n\nOkay, you got me. How do I apply?\n\nstep 1: Email us at community@sudowrite.com . Tell us why this is your dream job, why you‚Äôre our dream community person, and send us any relevant work.\n\nstep 2: We‚Äôll carefully review your application and either do a 30 minute call or kindly thank you for applying and feel really bad if it‚Äôs not a fit but that‚Äôs just how it goes sometimes.\n\nstep 3: If we‚Äôre both into it, you‚Äôll do a short assignment\n\nstep 4: We‚Äôll chat with your references\n\nstep 5: You‚Äôll meet the rest of the team over Zoom\n\nstep 6: üéâ\n\nWe can‚Äôt wait to meet you!",

I mean, there's the one mentioned already but I found out you have to use a personal API key and there's more stuff to it. Kinda turned me off because I just want to get in and write. Have you tried the cheaper models on Sudowrite? Claude Haiku is pretty good with instructions and has a cheaper cost. While Mistral is also good with instructions but needs a bit more editing. If I remember right, they also have a quick chat (Chat GPT 3.5 which is free in the app itself, so you don't have to work outside the app).\n\n## Comment ID ldef2r9 with +3 score by [(killerdinodeeno, Reddit, 2024-07-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/ldef2r9/) (in reply to ID 1e47dyi):\nAll in all, it‚Äôs about the same amount of effort to get set up to write between Sudowrite and NovelCrafter. If you think about what goes into SW from the perspective of setting up the beats, etc. Neither produce great prose right out of the gate. But yeah, from a UI perspective (plug and play) SW is better for beginners. \n\nPersonally, I switched from SW to NC about a year ago because I was tired of wasting my monthly credits on prose that wasn‚Äôt useable. NC with the API key though OpenRouter (so it‚Äôs just 1 key) lets me play with so so many different models. And NC let‚Äôs you customize prompts, wheat SW doesn‚Äôt. I like having that level of control. Once you get used to it, I‚Äôve found it to be much better and cheaper than SW. That‚Äôs just my opinion, though. I definitely encourage anyone who is new to AI tools to try them out and see what works for you and your process.\n\n### Comment ID ldehxh5 with +1 score by [(ecchirhino99, Reddit, 2024-07-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/ldehxh5/) (in reply to ID ldef2r9):\nTo use novelcrafter to chat edit(review) a scene you need tier 3 subscription artisan tier?

It‚Äôs a workhorse, and they are always working on updates that people actually want.\n\nAt the same time, if you‚Äôre not ready to take the plunge, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with just using TypingMind and connect it to your OpenRouter account. If you‚Äôre just inserting beats into an existing scene, chat might be all you need.\n\nAlso consider the possibility that if what you really want is fresh, original, truly creative writing that the world has never seen before, written in a voice that is all your own, then you‚Äôre going to have to write it yourself.

That's tricky to offer advice for since a lot of it is just about having the right kind of gut feeling to play into the AI's strength, and the the only way to get that is through the experience of using it.\n\nIn particular to the output length, I don't try to extend past the default, but instead I just generate multiple times if I feel like the AI is hitting a good vibe. There are a number of things which are only reevaluated when a new generation starts (chief among them being lorebook keys), so my impression is that the quality of long outputs tends to degrade severely over time.\n\n## Comment ID lgnijn0 with +4 score by [(whywhatwhenwhoops, Reddit, 2024-08-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/1ekf637/is_there_a_way_to_make_novelai_similar_to/lgnijn0/) (in reply to ID 1ekf637):\nWhat do mean by a config more like sudowrite?

What I mean is, in NovelAi you have memory, author's note, lorebook, and different config presets. Depending how well you use the previous 4 things together the quality of the output varies massively. On top of that, you have instructs to push the AI even more into a specific direction.

Author is self-explanatory (just needs to be well-known enough that the model gets the reference). Title can be anything that sort of conveys the feel or topic. Tags can be words or phrases that convey themes and concepts you want in the story, comma-delineated if you want to use multiple, just don't go overboard). And Genre should be a well-established genre term, such as the lists of literary genres found on Wikipedia or Amazon.\n\nYou can leave out fields you don't want to use, just maintain the format (spaces between the brackets and the tag line, and each field separated by semicolons).\n\nStyle is fairly flexible. It should be a comma-delineated list of words or phrases (like Tags), but more about the kind of writing you want to see. There are trained in phrases (such as \"prose\", \"complex\", etc...), but many words will work (\"descriptive\", \"sensory\", etc...). [Here are some examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/18corhv/style_tags_for_sensory_language/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) of sensory language tags, but there is no fixed list, so feel free to experiment with soemthing that you think might fit your story.\n\nEdit: Beyond that, play around with different config presets, maybe try out some of the community ones from Discord. Between all of these, you can get extremely evocative writing that puts pretty much any other AI to shame. \"Logic\" is still a weak point though.\n\n## Comment ID lgtkws3 with +2 score by [(bobsburger4776, Reddit, 2024-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/1ekf637/is_there_a_way_to_make_novelai_similar_to/lgtkws3/) (in reply to ID 1ekf637):\nIs sudowrtie completely uncensored now?

It‚Äôs a great way to get a ton of value. Plus, Sudowrite's Quick Tools, like *Quick Edit* and *Quick Chat*, are *unlimited* and included free with the plans. I'm always using them to make light edits or have a chat directly within my document, making the writing process smoother and more integrated.\n\nHere's an example of prose generated using your sentence starter with the Chat4o Mini model:\n\n>She inspects the hammer with careful precision, her fingers lightly tracing the worn wooden handle. It had seen better days‚Äîsplintered at the edge, coated in a fine layer of dust that hinted at years of neglect. But it was its head that intrigued her most. The metal glinted under the flickering fluorescent light, marred by splotches of something dark and unidentifiable.\n\n>Marjorie glanced around the cramped workshop, the air thick with the scent of rust and old wood. The walls were lined with tools of all kinds, each one telling a story she was desperate to unravel. But this hammer‚Ä¶ it felt crucial. The sound of distant sirens echoed through the open window. Time was running out.\n\n>Her heart raced as she replayed the events of the night before‚Äîthe confrontation with Richard, his wild accusations, then that chilling silence when he‚Äôd stormed out into the rain. She had thought it was just another argument, another moment lost in their spiraling relationship. But now? Now she understood there was something darker at play.\n\n>She slipped a small flashlight from her pocket and directed its beam onto the workbench beside her. There, half-hidden beneath a pile of scrap metal, lay a crumpled piece of paper. Instinct told her to be cautious, but curiosity drove her closer. As she extended her hand, her eyes caught more stains on the floor‚Äîominous dark patches that trailed from the bench to the back door.\n\n>Was Richard here? Or had someone else entered this place during their fight? The questions ignited a fire in her gut that made her pulse quicken. Marjorie hesitated only a moment longer before unfolding the paper, every creak and crinkle seeming thunderous in the tense air around her.\n\n>Words began to form ‚Äîa name scrawled hastily across the top: Arthur Blackwood. Her breath hitched in her throat as realization dawned; Arthur‚Äîthe man who had disappeared without a trace two weeks prior. She had assumed he was simply another casualty in their chaotic town, but this suggested otherwise.\n\n>The sirens grew louder, pulling her from thoughts spiraling into darkness. She had to move‚Äîhad to find out what connection this hammer, and those stains held to Arthur's fate before someone else made their way through that door behind her and erased everything once and for all.",

It is amazing for helping get my ideas and characters into a tight outline.\n\nBut I dispute that the content can pass for an actual novel or match tones. People get more and more heavily into complex headers and guardrails and style guide and beats and genre, but the output still has \"that AI feel\"--piercing blue eyes, tidy bows, affirmations, cliches, rushing through scenes, etc. \n\nI'm not aware of anything that has the same full-suite features and structures as Sudowrite. \n\nFor matching tones, NovelAi is the best and cheapest, because it is guided by what you write and picks up your tones and characterisation in a quite amazing way. And it lets you tinker a lot under the hood. But it doesn't help at all with structuring and plotting, which IMO is Sudo's strength.\n\nIt's possible that what would work for you best is a free LLM like LLama2 or CGPT for plotting and character sketches, and NA for actual writing (copy the character sketches into Lorebooks). Even the cheapest tier of NA had the highest level of context and unlimited generations with Clio, which is a pretty good model.\n\n#### Comment ID k3crgss with +2 score by [(NoYesterday7832, Reddit, 2023-10-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/k3crgss/) (in reply to ID k3codl8):\nHow are you doing that?

Whenever I ran the story stats, it was at least 85% my content. And that‚Äôs fine! But I was really looking for something that would take my prose and _run with it_, so I decided to try out Sudowrite. \n\nI literally only just got started, but already I‚Äôm feeling a bit _ugh_ about the whole thing. I spent around 3 hours creating all of my backstory, character definitions, example writing, etc. I was very specific about the perspective (‚ÄòI‚Äô am the narrator, ‚Äòyou‚Äô are the main character, as if I‚Äôm telling the story _to you_). \n\nImmediately, it got it wrong. It started writing in the first person for the wrong character. And despite giving it a decent example of my writing and style, it sounded absolutely nothing like me. So I paused it, intent on correcting it‚Ä¶ and it just _kept going_. For minutes. It spat out around a thousand words before it finally decided to pause. \n\nI then spent another hour rewriting almost _all_ of that first block - changing the character perspective, rewriting big chunks of it, and then adding some of my own, carrying the story on (and following my predefined beats).\n\nI finally got to a good jumping-off point and inserted it over the previously-generated text, then hit ‚Äòcontinue‚Äô‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶and it just kicked off as if I‚Äôd done nothing. It started from exactly where I‚Äôd stopped it before, ignoring everything I‚Äôd written. It immediately jumped back to writing the character from the first-person (rather than the second), and with that same pulp-fiction prose that sounds nothing like me.\n\nI‚Äôve used a fair few generative AI tools, and what I‚Äôm used to is them taking the backstory/permanent memory/definitions etc., and then the _context_ of what‚Äôs been written (like its ‚Äòshort-term memory‚Äô) to inform what it writes next.

If so a more detailed explanation than second person might just confuse it.\n\nIf you are using the story engine feature Sudowrite's story engine doesn't really have the ability to analyze your writing style.  When you upload your writing sample all it does is generate a description of your writing style.  Which means they pass that description on to the AI not your prose.   I don't know if generating prose in the chapter, kind of like NovelAI rather than in story engine would work better.\n\nStart off by generating small amounts of text (just 2 to 4 beats) and see if you can get it to work how you want it to.  Then it won't continue writing for a long time.\n\nAlso the discord has a lot of helpful people in it. \n\nThat said if you are usually doing SFW stuff you might be better off trying Claude 2.  At 100k or 200k contexts you can paste a huge writing sample and tell it to imitate your style.\n\n### Comment ID kha7mdd with +1 score by [(PartyMuffinButton, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/kha7mdd/) (in reply to ID kh99cvl):\nRe: POV - yes, but regardless it ignores how I‚Äôd defined the characters and their pronouns (it made the second character the first, and is ignoring corrections). \n\nI had a conversation with someone at sudowrite a few days ago and asked them about ‚ÄòStory Engine‚Äô because I didn‚Äôt see it.

Story engine is now the Chapter Generator feature.  But there's an alternative way to generate prose which is using the \"write\" \"rewrite\" \"describe\" buttons in the chapter text area.  That's the one more like Novel AI that I  meant.\n\nIf the story engine is screwing up just pause it, it'll only go to the end of the current two beats, then change the instructions in the beats then hit restart after deleting the bad prose and try again.  \"Most accurate\" is the ai most likely to follow your instructions.\n\n#### Comment ID khabap9 with +1 score by [(superamit, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/khabap9/) (in reply to ID kha7mdd):\nWere you putting \"Second-person POV\" in the style?

When I was using that tool, I actually did it the old-fashioned way with my story (or chapter) in a document and Write with some key details filled in.

Plus, after their pricing change, I (not on an active subscription), seem to have lost all the words from my extra pack I'd bought back when I was on Max.

I had one killing off toddlers at a birthday party. I've tested with even their \"censored\" models - Anthropic and OpenAI - and those will work as long as there is no sexual content. The thing you will have to watch is wording in other boxes that could cause potential issues.\n\nFor example, I write dark mafia romance. Let's say in my genre box I have something with drugs or alcohol to indicate the boss's business, and I have something about writing graphic sexual details in my style box because I will have intimate scenes. Normally, you want to keep these up-to-date with the chapter or scene you are writing, but pretend I forgot to change those things. Now I'm going to write a scene involving a character's minor child, that could trigger because I've mentioned those things (drugs, alcohol, or sexual descriptions) for how the prose should be written. Take that wording out, and it's good to go. \n\nI have two series that involve human trafficking and one with minors. As long as I'm only talking about them being taken or hurt (not sexually), it will generate.

There isn't any law in the US concerning explicit sex or any fictional depiction of violence or sex. That said, just because you write it doesn't mean anyone will read it. Major books, including the bible, feature incest, rape, and child brides. There is zero reason why software in the US should censor the written word. This is being done to prevent some lawsuit against the company, but don't quote the censorship as needing to comply with the law. There are some obscenity laws in certain states, but these only become an issue when an offensive work is widely commercialized. Some erotica and kink writers write for very small closed-loop audiences (PERFECTLY LEGAL). \"Distasteful\" doesn't constitute a violation of the law.\n\n## Comment ID kzsleep with +1 score by [(juken7, Reddit, 2024-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/kzsleep/) (in reply to ID 11lthuu):\nThanks for the info was about try the service even tho it's really expensive but know that I know will look for a better censor free A.I editor...\n\n## Comment ID lkjd9tb with +1 score by [(Entire-Adeptness9407, Reddit, 2024-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/lkjd9tb/) (in reply to ID 11lthuu):\nOk so I got similar issue first time it happened was when Warcraft was mentioned in the story, second time was when a woman threatened to cut someone's balls off, I have mostly steered away from violence and this wasn't really violence, just a threat\n\n## Comment ID lkjrwnr with +1 score by [(Entire-Adeptness9407, Reddit, 2024-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/lkjrwnr/) (in reply to ID 11lthuu):\nOk I started using Sudowrite, because it promoted itself for being uncensored, but lately it hasn't been the case\n\n## Comment ID lyf0hrn with +1 score by [(TGirlHaileyHols, Reddit, 2024-11-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/lyf0hrn/) (in reply to ID 11lthuu):\nWith sudo wrote you need to be crystal clear bc it follows this algorithm, girl=below 18 yrs old, female adult or 28 yr old female adult,l=adult, and thr like yes despite the cage being given as 28 yr old girl¬† the term girl indicates below puberty as that is how the algorithm of these writing software work, I krefer using hyperwrite for safety uses bur if you want unfiltered and unadulterated content yiu may have to use Toolbaz instead make sure thst your ad blocker is off but thr max word count is 300 words so you may have to rely on your own mind and all unfortunately reas books how to wrote stories buy them from Amazon so yiu have a way to understand what and how to write I Blame grade school for getting rid of the graduation writing test requirements bc you are given a topic sentence and then have to wrote 3-5page essay using sole sentence have the sentence in every paragraph of the essay, the 3-5 pages is front and back of one page equals one page then you may been able to write better stories and all.\n\n## Comment ID jbe5u8w with +1 score by [(some_user_name_1109, Reddit, 2023-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/jbe5u8w/) (in reply to ID 11lthuu):\nYour fault\n\n## Comment ID jdforhb with +1 score by [(Rekard_Volfey, Reddit, 2023-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/jdforhb/) (in reply to ID 11lthuu):\nSudowrite wrote some erotica for me.

I've got it working pretty well here.  Maybe I can offer some suggestions.\n\nIt's important to understand which codex entries are visible to the AI.  Your characters, for example. . .  When you create a new codex entry and select \"character\" type, it should *track* that entry.  What that means is, if NC sees that character name in your prompt, then it'll provide that codex entry to the LLM.  It'll become part of the context for that scene.  So when you are writing your prompt for a scene beat, you should mention all the characters who are present in that scene *by name*.  You may have dozens of characters in your story, but NC will only show the LLM its cards for the ones that you mentioned in the prompt.  That keeps the LLM from being overwhelmed with too much information that's not relevant.\n\nYou can go into the **Plan** tab and then the **Matrix** view, and Novelcrafter will show you a grid with all the characters it's tracking, and which scenes they appear in.\n\nRaces. . .  Let's say you have a race of \"gnomes\" in your story.  If you haven't mentioned the word \"gnome\" in your prompt, the LLM might never get the info.  There are a couple of ways to fix this.  One is to go into the entries for your gnome characters and give each of them a Nested Reference to the gnome race.  Then, any time one of those characters gets pulled into the context, the card on gnomes gets pulled in too.  You can also do that with factions that various characters are members of, etc.\n\nIn each codex entry you can find a tab called **References** and a couple of options under **REFERENCE TRACKING**.  One option you can check is \"Always include this entry in the AI context.\"  If you switch that on, then the card will *always* be visible to the LLM.  You want to use this for things like genre and style that always apply to every part of your story.  You can also use it for important bits of lore.  The only reason not to over-use it is, like I said, to not overwhelm the LLM with the entire contents of your Codex and stuff that's not relevant to the task.\n\nAll of the *scene summaries* are also part of the LLM context!  That means keeping your scene summaries up-to-date is super helpful to the AI knowing where it is and what it's doing.  You can get your choice of AI to write those summaries for you, so there's no excuse.  Once you have a scene completed to your satisfaction, with a few clicks you can have the AI reading it and writing a summary of the important events, which then becomes part of its knowledge base for generating future scenes.\n\nIf you are set up with OpenRouter, you have a lot of LLMs available, and you can experiment freely.  However. . .  In my experience there are only a few that give top results.  ChatGPT is always reliable.  At this moment, Claude was recently updated and produces the very best output.  Claude has become pretty smart, and if he is routinely getting confused, it almost certainly means that he's not getting the context he needs from Novelcrafter.\n\n## Comment ID krrh7w8 with +5 score by [(MeridianASK, Reddit, 2024-02-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/krrh7w8/) (in reply to ID 1akj00y):\nDon't use any of them.

It only works on the desktop version but it has an upload button to get your document in the chat and you can use an openrouter API to use free models all though they won't support as huge of a context.¬†\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xHY3OHUNOrQ&pp=ygUQT2JzaWRpYW4gY29waWxvdA%3D%3D\n\n## Comment ID kpb7cla with +4 score by [(21limo, Reddit, 2024-02-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/kpb7cla/) (in reply to ID 1akj00y):\nSudowrite is really impressive but monetize method is really greedy.

Novelcrafter is great with OpenRouter, and allows you to use a shitload of models - but Sudowrite has a good spread of them too. \n\nOverall, I'd say **NovelAI** is the best all-rounder. It's cheaper for heavy users since there's no character limit, but you do sometimes need to get a little more into the settings and lore memory to get results you like. But it's fast, flexible, has a nice UI, and will let you type 24/7 for as long as you like. \n\n**Novelcrafter** is a close second to **Sudowrite** for me. I really like Novelcrafter - Openrouter gets you a ton of versatility for really *cheap* - but frankly, 75% of those models aren't really going to see use. What's more, I've found it kind of difficult to use seamlessly with natural writing - though perhaps, I don't know enough.  My main gripes are that:   \n **1)** You have to break out of prose to do a / command for continuing the story - and it, *afaik,* doesn't do a very good job of reading previous text for context, and you have to write a blurb telling it what you want to do. With Sudowrite and Novelai, it's a keypress and it picks up where you left off seamlessly, letting you tweak from there.   \n**2)** You can generate one thing, with one model, at a time. One of my favorite things about Sudowrite is parallel generating *2 or more cards*. Plus, since fiddling with length is unintuitive in NC, you often end up with a long generation that veers off course in the middle, and you have to repeat **1)** again in the middle of your passage. \n\nSudowrite's biggest downside is that it's less flexible and customizable, and far more expensive per generation than Novelcrafter. \n\nI *want* to like Novelcrafter, but using it right now feels hard and unrewarding - writing the same thing in Sudowrite or Nai, I get much farther much faster than with Novelcrafter. \n\nPlease, do sell me on novelcrafter - I'd love to see it dethrone the others at that price point, but as it stands, I'm torn between NovelAi and Sudowrite.\n\n### Comment ID l6abrbj with +1 score by [(Dude_Man_Bro_Sir, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/l6abrbj/) (in reply to ID l6a4j3l):\nThank you for the detailed write up. I've alternated between NAI and NC since I posted this so I have some thoughts about the two tools.\n\nI agree with your points about NAI and NC.\n\nI like the way NAI produces output and is very fluid/natural with my own writing. NC, on the other hand, also provides chatbot functionality with the same models I picked for story generation (only the two models too) but the story generation is kind of clunky and needs instructions to produce content.\n\nConversely, I like NC's lore book, planning, and shelving system more than NAI's. NC allows you to create a series so you can group together different stories (or books) that occur in the same series. It can be entirely different stories or it can be a sequence of stories.\n\nWhile NAI does have a shelving system that also groups stories together, NC's system has the added benefit of making it so a lore entry can be book-level or series-level. So, you don't necessarily have to remake a lore entry if you make a new story with the same characters or in the same setting as the previous one. Unfortunately, NAI doesn't have that and you need to export it from the previous story and import it into the new story.\n\nNC also offers a more robust story planning system, where you can create a story outline with separate acts, chapters, and scenes. It has the benefit of making it easy to traverse your story if you need to go back to a different chapter or jump to the current one to continue typing.\n\nNAI puts it all into one document so if you want to separate the story into chapters, you can either create a new story in the shelf (and import the lore book) or separate the document into different chapters with \"Chapter 1\", etc, and then using CTRL + F to jump between chapters.\n\nI can't really say to use one over the other at this stage since both NC and NAI have their pros and cons still.\n\n#### Comment ID l6ahld7 with +3 score by [(waker1771, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/l6ahld7/) (in reply to ID l6abrbj):\nI think that NC is probably more useful for heavy outliners and those with a large-scale work in mind. It offers a lot more horsepower in that regard for sure. \n\nI'd be curious to hear your take on Sudowrite - I had hoped for a super clear-cut winner (don't we all?) in all this, so I could subscribe to one service alone without headache.   \n  \nUnfortunately, just like a lot of things, there's all sorts of pros and cons to weigh. \n\nI'd say my final breakdown looks something like this:   \n  \n**Sudowrite** is best in class for high-volume, quality output with minimal tweaking, and a useful, very intuitive writing toolset. But, you lose fine model control, some flexibility, and it's more costly. So if you want to fully realize an idea fully the fastest, and/or get more AI assistance, it's a winner.\n\n**Novelcrafter** gives very robust planning, lore, and outline tools, chat functions, and unmatched model availability for a low cost, but you lose that speedy workflow and high, multi-generation output. If you want to write a full-length novel in a large, cohesive universe, albeit with slightly less AI assistance, it's a great fit. \n\n**NovelAI** is a great all-rounder and adapts to style very well. It's snappy, reliable, and flexible; with unlimited generation. But, you may need to tinker a bit more than others, and there's no matching Openrouter's model breadth. Less high-volume than Sudowrite, but more than NC. If you're looking for reliable, strong writing with a high degree of output control, look no further.   \n  \nPersonally, I think NAI is starting to fall behind SW and NC with their access to newer, cutting edge LLM models, since NAI develops their own. For pros, NAI really manages to avoid the common AI phrasing and repetition pitfalls, feels more authentic and original, and is better at adapting to author style. As a con, though, it is a bit slower to adapt when there's large leaps made.\n\n## Comment ID kz7511s with +1 score by [(MnG_FGO_GT, Reddit, 2024-04-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/kz7511s/) (in reply to ID 1akj00y):\nI want to ask something.

I get that Sudowrite can feel a bit like a maze at first, and running low on credits doesn't help. Transparent talk first. I'm an ambassador for them. So, Sudowrite packs in a ton of features to boost your writing, which can be a lot to take in. Here's a quick guide to help you organize your chapter ideas:\n\n**Editor**: This is your main writing area, much like Google Docs or Word. Draft your chapters here.\n\n**Story Engine**: Great for plotting out your novel. You can dump your story ideas, set the genre and style, and let it help craft a synopsis. It also aids in building characters and outlines. \n\n**Story Bible**: Think of this as your reference guide for all story elements like characters, settings, plot points etc to keep everything consistent.\n\n**Plugins:** Sudowrite offers plugins to add new features without needing to code. These can introduce fresh ways to write, edit, and analyze your work. \n\nCheck out the \"[Quick Start](https://docs.sudowrite.com/getting-started/dQph1snuwbfMWG9wRjsNug/quick-start/2A4FjtiocrtxHPUyz6WZgR)\" guide. It gives an overview of Sudowrite‚Äôs interface and tools in under 11 minutes. \n\nSo those credits... Sudowrite uses a credit system; each AI feature uses up some credits. To make the most of them you need to know that different features eat different amounts of credits. For example, generating longer passages with a full Character Cast or having thick entries in Worldbuilding or using the latest AI models might use more credits. But there are cheaper AI models that write almost as good and cost next to nothing like GPT 4o Mini. \n\nBuy Extra Credits if Needed: If you run out but want to keep going, you can buy one-time extra credits. These don't expire and stay with your account until used. \n\nAlso, \"Quick Tools\" like Quick Edit and Quick Chat are included with your subscription and don't use credits unless you switch on High Quality mode. \n\nIf you need more help, feel free to ask. Happy writing!",

Apparently some people have been contacted due to being bad boys/girls and writing what they aren't supposed to? Hasn't happened to me ever, but yeah.\n\nAs for the new pricing, it's scandalous. Now, I'll be honest, I don't actually know it works, like how it calculates this shit on the inside - I don't much care, either. I care about what I pay and what I get.\n\nThe credits used seem to increase exponentially (as in, the more beats you have, the higher the cost is going to be). I have it open right now 2 beats is 4,3k credits, but 8 beats already jumps to 10,8k. If I try to put in 16 beats (estimated word count \\~3200) the price is a whopping \\~46800 credits, lol.\n\nI guess you could squeeze out more words if you keep your written stories to smaller beats, but if we went with the 16 beats example from above then you'd get like 15k words for $10. Probably more or less depending on how you use it, but yeah.\n\nIn other words, the cheapest possible option got a bit better, especially if you're going out of your way to use it sparingly. Maybe you could even eek out 15k+ words out of it if you use it well.\n\nBut if you wanted to go for the other ones, then you'd be getting completely FUCKED. $20 used to buy you 90k words. Now it buys you about 4x more credits than the $10 one, so about 50k-60k give or take?\n\nThe most expensive option also got severely downgraded. You used to buy 300k for $100. Now you just get the mid-sized one but doubled, so I guess 100k-120k words (though I'd wager that's closer to 100k).\n\nSo to get the 300k words from before, you'd have to spend $150, and to get the 90k words from before you'd have to spend $30. I think it's fair to say it got a **50% price increase**, at least from my perspective and how I use it.\n\nNow, I have no doubt that their defense force is going to come here and explain how this is actually TOTALLY IN YOUR BENEFIT BRO!!! as it calculates words differently depending on what you're doing and bla bla fucking bla. But yeah, they got greedier, as if their service wasn't already greedy enough.\n\nAnd by the way, these numbers were all considered under the yearly sub pricing. If you wanted to do monthly then they unironically expect you to pay $20 for a measly 10k words for the base plan. Absolutely insane.\n\n### Comment ID kdeegvq with +7 score by [(NaweGR, Reddit, 2023-12-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/18h1rpe/thoughts_on_sudowrites_new_pricing_plans/kdeegvq/) (in reply to ID kd5q57h):\nAmusingly enough, I see that on one of the /r/ArtificialIntelligence threads one of the SW folks on Reddit is trying to argue this isn't a price increase.

Usually, when you get a higher tier, you save a bit of money, but I guess the perk to Max that you get is being able to save credits for a year. I'm not sure if the credit packs are the same price for both plans. Perhaps there is a savings there as well, but I didn't purchase the plans to try and find out. To be fair, they did offer to give me a membership for the month to check out what's new, but I'm still not sure about whether or not I will take them up on it since the novel I wrote on there, which I thought was awesome, turned out (after a closer examination), to totally scream GPT, haha.

I can't wait till it's available. Maybe that's why SW decided to go for this suddenly price hike.

And it goes without saying that generating images is a LOT more taxing on a system than generating text.

What's the point in generating 120,000 words if I'm going to have to delete and re-write almost all of them?

I found it was better for small chunks that I just didn't want to write, like describe a big room with a door at the end, but it's novel generator bit wasn't great.

IMO it works well when you're starting out, but it gets clunky when you want to insert chapters/scenes and basically start moving content around. Novel writing is not a linear experience, and that's where SW's inflexible nature does little to help with that. \n\nNovelcrafter is actually very clever, super fast, clean and intuitive (once you'd had a good play with it). You don't even have to use the AI as it lets you write whatever you want without switching it on, ie plan your acts, chapters, scenes, codex (characters, locations etc). If you want to use the Ai then you can go with OpenRouter or even LLM (for local use). Ai prompts can be fully customised too. The codex integration is insane - think of a wiki WITHIN your novel :) \n\nNC's Discord group is active, honest and supportive. Sign up for the beta and give it a go.\n\n### Comment ID kff8fp7 with +5 score by [(Minimum_Spell_2553, Reddit, 2023-12-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/18h1rpe/thoughts_on_sudowrites_new_pricing_plans/kff8fp7/) (in reply to ID kdbkyf0):\nI've tried Sudo, Chatgbt 4, novelAI, and now NovelCrafter for for a while.  I just cancelled my Sudo and Catgbt 4 subscriptions ($50/month) and moved everything to NovelCrafter.    \nSudo's new pricing looks exactly like NovelCrafter's platform where you pick your AI platforms when you generate words - just like NovelCrafter.  But Sudo charges twice as much for it.    \nI love NC now.  It saves me a lot of money because I can access same APIs and get billed as I use it.  I think Sudo is scrambling due to NovelAI and NC competition.\n\n#### Comment ID kfmy7vz with +2 score by [(Minimum_Spell_2553, Reddit, 2023-12-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/18h1rpe/thoughts_on_sudowrites_new_pricing_plans/kfmy7vz/) (in reply to ID kff8fp7):\n>38 comments\n\nI saw that Sudo auto billed me for the next month today after I cancelled the plan yesterday.  I had to cancell it another time, in which they offered me a 3 month 30% discount if I kept the service.  I declined, then wrote a nasty comment about unethical billing practices and that I launched a dispute with my credit card.  Wow I am pissed by this behavior.  If you want to end the marriage, make sure you cancell 2 weeks in advance and keep cancelling it till you get notification that it's cancelled - or freeze the credit card they will hit till your renewal date has passed.  And send them an email telling them you have cancelled the serice ([hi@sudowrite.com](mailto:hi@sudowrite.com)).

With CHATGPT I can put in a passage and say something like \"cAn you rewrite this and make the character more rebellious, more angry...?\" etc... and it does so, then I take what I like. \n\n  \nWith Sudowrite as far as I can tell I can just tick off elements I want it to improve on -- more description etc... is there a way to give it more specific details about what I want it to rewrite the way I do with CHATGPT? Or does it not work that way?\n\n  \nThanks for any help. \n\n## Comment ID ldoc4ht with +1 score by [(anusdotcom, Reddit, 2024-07-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e5ol00/sudowrite_how_to_give_it_rewrite_instructions/ldoc4ht/) (in reply to ID 1e5ol00):\nYes. Via plugins.\n\nNormally you can just write your own plugin with the model and changes you want and apply it to the text that you have selected. You can also reference your story bible in a plugin.\n\nTo give it your own instructions every time, there is a toggle to allow user to give instructions and you reference this in your plugin.\n\nhttps://docs.sudowrite.com/using-sudowrite/1ow1qkGqof9rtcyGnrWUBS/how-do-i-build-plugins/a3iVxJb4UZLKfSxf8BG3mY\n\n### Comment ID ldp5icm with +1 score by [(BigOldComedyFan, Reddit, 2024-07-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e5ol00/sudowrite_how_to_give_it_rewrite_instructions/ldp5icm/) (in reply to ID ldoc4ht):\nTHanks!

      "# [A neural net wrote my book. Kidding. Sort of. by leanneleeds.com on 2021-06-02](https://leanneleeds.com/artificial-intelligence-in-fiction/)\nThis FAQ has been getting missed in a big way, so I‚Äôm moving it up to the front.\n\n(Moved and updated 6-12-2024)\n\nIn June 2021, I began working with Sudowrite, an AI writing assistant for fiction writers. And by ‚Äúworking with,‚Äù I mean I started using the software. In July of 2022, I was featured fairly prominently in How independent writers are turning to AI ‚Äì The Verge, but because they primarily used my real name (Jennifer Lepp) instead of my pen name (Leanne Leeds,) no one paid me much notice. AI use in fiction was getting far less attention than art-generating AI.\n\nAnd then ChatGPT blew that all to hell. (I did a follow-up interview on that, too though my pen name was a bit more prominently pointed out thanks to my complaint about my real name use.\n\nI didn‚Äôt think that one through.)\n\nAt this point, I‚Äôm seeing some things mentioned about me that are pretty inaccurate I felt the need to put this up. So, here we go.\n\nI read somewhere that you use AI/ChatGPT to generate all your books now.\n\nYep, I read that, too.\n\nWhen this all started, I didn‚Äôt honestly know how much of the AI-generated text I actually used because I just went with the flow and didn‚Äôt have too big a concern with keeping track. As this became a hotter and hotter topic (and I‚Äôve seen statements from folks claiming I ‚Äúgenerate‚Äù my books or have the AI ‚Äúcreate‚Äù them,) I got curious, so I used PostSEO text compare to compare my finished chapter and the text that was generated by the AI in my session.\n\nThe following is a screenshot of the chapter I wrote yesterday, and this seems to be pretty average. I‚Äôve had results as low as 8%, and as high as 11%. On average, 90% are the words from my brain, and 10% are the words from the #AI.\n\nI do not use AI for plot suggestions as some do‚ÄîI know where my chapters and scenes are going, I use AI to phrase things better.\n\nWhat part of your books does ChatGPT write?\n\nNone. Almost all words in my books (the 10% above) are from Anthropic‚Äôs Claude.\n\nDo you write faster with AI? I read that you use AI to write fast.\n\nI read that, too (and said it was my goal before I read it.) Unfortunately, no. It still takes me six-seven weeks to write a book. I did not get any speed gain out of AI use because I still pretty much write the book. I just incorporate different aids to keep me moving or vary phrasings/ways to say things, Anthropic‚Äôs Claude being the predominant one.\n\nDo you teach people to use AI?\n\nI do not work for any AI company. Sudowrite did pay me to write a few blog posts sharing some of my tips and tricks while they looked for and hired a Community Leader, but I have never specifically taught any class or worked as an instructor for pay with regard to AI. My primary occupation is fiction writing, and that‚Äôs what I do for a living.\n\nYou‚Äôre a plagiarist! (Or you‚Äôre not a real writer, you‚Äôre cheating, and so on and so on)\n\nI personally don‚Äôt feel that AI companies are doing anything legally wrong, and I‚Äôm comfortable using artificial intelligence in my creative endeavors. I‚Äôm comfortable with the fact that I‚Äôm still a writer. I realize other people feel differently, and I respect that viewpoint and people‚Äôs choice not to use it or patronize people that do use it. Don‚Äôt buy my books if you hate all these things so much it makes you grind your teeth‚Äîany book that AI was used to edit has a statement to that effect in the book so readers can be informed.\n\nI am also, though, aware that this is a new frontier, and a court may decide to make some new law/update the law/re-explain the law in a way that it applies here, so I‚Äôll be watching just like everyone else and will make changes in my own use if/when needed.\n\nTools I currently use:\n\nThis is current as of 11/10/2024.\n\nNovelCrafter ‚Äì this software is exactly what I was looking for without AI. The Codex is game changing for me, the type of story bible ease I‚Äôve been looking for. In fact, I only use the Codex, but you can use this with AI.\n\nQuillbot ‚Äì to quickly rephrase sentences/as a thesaurus on a per sentence editing basis.\n\nAnthropic‚Äôs Claude ‚Äì for fiction revising and rephrasing.\n\nGoogle‚Äôs NotebookLM ‚Äì for querying my series.\n\nLitRPG Adventures ‚Äì for fantasy locations and characters\n\nScribeShadow ‚Äì Novel translations.\n\nTools I have used but no longer use:\n\nSudowrite ‚Äì for fiction rewriting and work with narrative prose.\n\nPoe by Quora ‚Äì Poe is a service developed by Quora and launched in December 2022. It allows access to a range of AI bots, including my two preferred LLMs: GPT-4o and Claude Opus. This cuts the access cost (ChatGPT+ at $20/m and Claude+ at $20/m) in half (Poe $20/m) and the number of messages allowed per month is more than enough for my use.\n\nChatGPT+ ‚Äì for Dalle-3 and Vision. (I still use the LLM, just via API or Poe instead.)\n\nThings I wrote about the tools I‚Äôm using/was using:\n\n(Please note much of this is older information)\n\nSudowrite Tips and Tricks\n\nMy first days with Sudowrite (June 2021 ‚Äì October 2021)\n\nArticles\n\n(Please note much of this is older information)\n\nNew Yorker: The Computers Are Getting Better at Writing\n\nThe Verge: The Great Fiction of AI: The strange world of high-speed semi-automated genre fiction ‚Äì a long-form article that yours truly appears in.\n\nThe Verge: How Kindle novelists are using ChatGPT ‚Äì an interview with me about the ChatGPT explosion\n\nAI-Generated Content and Copyright Law: What We Know (Posted Apr. 18, 2023 ‚Äì this landscape is likely to change rapidly, so by the time you read this, some questions in the article may have been answered in a court case or by a regulatory body somewhere.)\n\n4 Ethical Questions Generative AI Poses\n\nThe scary truth about AI copyright is nobody knows what will happen next\n\nVideos\n\n(Please note much of this is older information)\n\nThe Creative Penn (YouTube): The AI-Augmented Author.

      "# [I tried Sudowrite to overcome writer‚Äôs block ‚Äî and I finally finished my novel by Amanda Caswell on 2024-09-04](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/i-tried-sudowrite-to-overcome-writer-s-block-and-i-finally-finished-my-novel)\nWhen I first heard about Sudowrite, I was intrigued but skeptical. The AI writing platform uses over two dozen AI models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude 2 by Anthropic, multiple open models, and transformer models created by OpenAI.\n\nThe result? Your writing gets a human-like narrative that's impressively good. After diving in, I can confidently say it has exceeded my expectations in many ways.\n\nLet‚Äôs take a closer look at how Sudowrite helps bring stories to life.\n\nMy first impressions\n\nUpon opening Sudowrite, I was greeted with a clean and intuitive interface, which meant I didn't have to spend hours figuring out how to use it. After watching a quick video, within minutes, I was ready to explore its three main modes: Describe, Brainstorm, and Rewrite.\n\nStarting a new project in Sudowrite is straightforward. I recommend enabling the Story Bible feature, where you can input all the details about your novel, including your outline, synopsis, and characters.\n\nOne of my favorite features is style. Simply input a sample paragraph, and AI will analyze and match your writing style. I included a paragraph of my own writing and even added that I wanted a structure similar to that of Beverly Cleary. Surprise ‚Äì Sudowrite delivered!\n\nHow Sudowrite helps you write\n\nThe Describe Mode is where Sudowrite truly shines. I often struggle to paint vivid pictures with my words, but this mode changed the game for me.\n\nBy inputting a few keywords or a simple sentence, Sudowrite generated detailed descriptions that added depth and richness to my writing. It felt like having a personal creative assistant who could effortlessly expand on my ideas.\n\nNext, I tried the Brainstorm Mode. As someone who occasionally hits creative roadblocks, this feature was a lifesaver.\n\nI fed it a basic concept, and Sudowrite presented me with a plethora of directions to take my story, which I then turned into beats for each chapter.\n\nIt was like having a brainstorming session with a highly imaginative friend who never runs out of ideas.\n\nOther features\n\nIn less than a minute, AI weaves together your beats to seamlessly generate a chapter. Be sure to keep the application open. Switching tabs might cause glitches. Once the chapter is created, you can go in and make any necessary edits or move on to the next chapter.\n\nSudowrite offers fun plugins to keep you motivated. Some of my favorites are the Simulated New Yorker Review, Encouraging Writing Buddy, Brainstorm, and Feedback. If you‚Äôre a glutton for punishment, you might enjoy the Hyper Critical Writing Buddy and Brutal Honesty Bot (personally, I avoid those at all costs).\n\nFinally, the Rewrite Mode helped me refine my drafts. It suggested alternative phrasings and sentence structures, making my writing flow better and read more smoothly. This mode is perfect for those final touches before hitting ‚Äòpublish‚Äô or submitting a manuscript.\n\nPerformance and pricing\n\nNow, let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room: pricing. Sudowrite‚Äôs subscription plans are on the higher side, which might be a dealbreaker for some. However, considering the productivity boost and creative inspiration it provided me, I found it worth the investment.\n\nIf you‚Äôre serious about writing and can afford it, Sudowrite is a valuable tool. You can give it a test drive for free, but if you‚Äôre serious about your writing, subscriptions start at $10/month. Trust me, it‚Äôs worth it.\n\nWhile Sudowrite impressed me overall, it wasn‚Äôt without flaws. I‚Äôve had it change a character‚Äôs name mid-story and transform another‚Äôs curly hair into a spiky hairdo for no reason. The AI generated content was generally coherent and contextually appropriate, but there were moments when the output felt a bit off. These instances required some manual tweaking, reminding me that AI still can‚Äôt completely replace the human touch.\n\nOne of the unexpected perks of Sudowrite is its strong community. The developers actively engage with users, regularly updating the platform based on feedback. Customer support is also top-notch, ensuring that any issues or questions are promptly addressed.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nSudowrite has genuinely transformed my approach to writing. Six months ago, if you had told me I‚Äôd complete not one, but two YA science fiction novels, I would have laughed.\n\nIf you‚Äôd told me one of those novels would hit #1 on Amazon for a week, I‚Äôd have begged for the secret.\n\nSudowrite isn‚Äôt just a tool; it‚Äôs a creative companion that can help unlock your writing potential. Give it a try, and you might just find yourself finally writing that novel.\n\nMore from Tom's Guide",
      "# [Sudowrite Review: Does it Write as Good As a Human? on 2023-08-17](https://kindlepreneur.com/sudowrite-review/)\nIn the ever-evolving world of AI and writing, there's a plethora of tools claiming to make our lives easier.\n\nOne such tool, Sudowrite, has piqued the curiosity of many writers, promising a variety of features to help craft their stories. But can it live up to the hype and truly assist authors in their creative process?\n\nWell if you‚Äôre just looking for the bottom line, I do believe that Sudowrite is the best AI tool out there for fiction writers. It‚Äôs got a massive amount of features that make it stand out, and they‚Äôre genuinely good too, not just fluff features for the sake of having features.\n\nSudowrite is not perfect, so if you‚Äôd like to learn more of my thoughts on this program, continue reading.\n\nThere is a misconception at large, especially among many writers, that AI writing tools will simply do the writing for you.\n\nThis is, thankfully, not true.\n\nWe are still a long way away from being able to push a button and an AI will automatically produce a genuinely good story. I think that is unlikely to ever happen in our lifetime.\n\nInstead, AI writing tools are not meant to replace human writers, but rather serve as helpful assistants. They can't do all the writing for you, but they're great for tasks like brainstorming ideas, fixing typos, or suggesting better word choices.\n\nThe best way I've ever heard it described is this: AI does for writing what calculators did for math. They let us have an easy way to deal with simple calculations so we can save time and achieve results that we could never have reached otherwise.\n\nFormat Beautiful Professional Books\n\nEasy to use, and and full of amazing features, you can quickly turn your book into a professional book.\n\nCheck It Out\n\nHere‚Äôs what I love about it and what I want in a tool: AI can handle some of the basics that you might find yourself spending too much brain power on, like fixing typos, suggesting better word choices, or even generating ideas when you're stuck in a rut. This means you can focus your energy on the more important aspects of your writing, like developing characters or story development.\n\nAnd just so we‚Äôre on the same page, here‚Äôs a quick reality check on what AI is realistically able to do.\n\nWhat AI Is Really Good At\n\nAI has made some incredible leaps forward in recent years, and it is almost hard for me to picture what I did before I had some of these tools at my fingertips because they have severely lessened the amount of creative headaches I get.\n\nBrainstorming: AI is currently really good at helping with brainstorming. I personally prefer ChatGPT for a lot of this, but as we will see, Sudowrite is busting at the seams with brainstorming power. Sometimes just seeing a few ideas on the page, even if they are really basic, is enough to get the creative juices flowing.\n\nOutlining: Since outlining involves structure, and AI is really good at understanding structure, it makes sense that AI is also really good at creating outlines. Most tools can pull off decent outlines from a simple synopsis as your prompt.\n\nImproving Your Writing: AI has actually been in use in proofreading programs like ProWritingAid or Grammarly for years, but AI is also becoming really good at more complex tasks, like improve the Flesch reading ease score, or changing the tense of your story with a simple prompt.\n\nDescriptions: Speaking from personal experience, I‚Äôm really bad at descriptions, and could really use more of them in my books. This is something AI is great for. You can give it a little context and it‚Äôs relatively easy to get some additional descriptions that you can layer into your prose.\n\nThings AI Is Not Good At‚Ä¶Yet\n\nAs of this writing, there are a few things that AI is still not great at, though the world of AI is constantly changing and improving, so this may not be the case for long:\n\nLong-form Writing: AI still struggles with Long-form writing, although it's getting a lot better, as Sudowrite's Story Engine shows us. Otherwise, if you want a long-form document, it usually needs to be assembled in much smaller pieces.\n\nConsistent Styles: It‚Äôs difficult for most AI to be consistent in the style you use. This is especially true if you have multiple characters with different speech patterns and personalities, requiring them to be written differently. With advanced prompting skills, you can mitigate this, but it requires a skilled prompt engineer.\n\nResearch: AI can‚Äôt do good research, and even the models that have crawled the Internet often get things wrong.\n\nStaying On Task: AI will often get distracted and stray from the outline/prompt without a LOT of human guidance.\n\nWhat I Look For\n\nSome of the things I look for in a tool include:\n\nThe User Experience: does it easily guide you through the AI-creation process\n\nAccuracy: while not always perfect, I like to compare the actual output for every AI tool. How well does it match what I wanted it to do?\n\nPeace of Mind: As I mentioned earlier, so far AI hasn‚Äôt actually saved me a ton of time in my experimentation (that may change as I get more experience). But what a good AI tool does is free up my mental headache. Creative writing is an intense experience, and for some (myself included) it can be creatively draining. Using AI almost always leaves me feeling less drained and I end up writing more and longer as a result. This is also why AI is a really good option for those with certain disabilities and mental illnesses.\n\nSo with all that in mind, let‚Äôs dive into this review of Sudowrite. Does it satisfy my requirements and leave me with less creative drain than I would otherwise?\n\nWhat is Sudowrite?\n\nSudowrite is primarily an AI writing and editing software. And this alone is nothing big. There are tons of AI tools out there, but this is one of the only ones that is specifically geared for fiction authors.\n\nSudowrite has various features, from Story Engine which helps you write the novel, to a bunch of brainstorming features, and a lot of other tools that let you edit the manuscript as you go.\n\nIn fact, it's kind of packed with features.\n\nOn my own personal YouTube channel (a side-project not affiliated with Kindlepreneur but posted here with permission), I did a complete walkthrough of the software and how it works. See here:\n\nIf you want more videos like this talking about the practical uses of AI in writing and marketing, be sure to subscribe to the channel.\n\nPricing: How Much Does Sudowrite Cost?\n\nSudowrite has three pricing tiers that you can purchase at a monthly rate, or annually for a slightly lesser fee.\n\n$19/month or $120/year for 30,000 AI words each month\n\n$29/month or $300/year for 90,000 AI words each month\n\n$129/month or $1200/year for 300,000 AI words each month\n\nCompared to a variety of other AI tools out there, this comes in roughly middle of the road. It‚Äôs not as cheap as ChatGPT, but it‚Äôs far better for the number of words you get than Jasper (which until ChatGPT came along was the undisputed king of AI copywriting).\n\nOf those options, I personally recommend the middle $29/month or $300/year plan. It has the best value.\n\nIs there a free version of Sudowrite?\n\nThere is not a permanently free version of Sudowrite, but if you use our special link, you can actually get 10,000 free AI generated words. That is plenty to try it out for yourself.\n\nTry Sudowrite Here\n\nHow to Use Sudowrite\n\nThere are a LOT of features that Sudowrite offers, so many that I‚Äôve decided to group many of them together and talk about each in a bulleted list. Hopefully this will help you wrap your mind around the many different options Sudowrite gives you.\n\nStory Engine\n\nBy far the most important, flagship feature that Sudowrite offers is Story Engine, the system that allows you to create books effortlessly by using a tiered, progressive system where you flesh out characters, the synopsis, the outline, your story beats, and then eventually your prose.\n\nIt's a great system that makes writing with AI easy.\n\nNow while it's not perfect, and certainly a far cry from being able to push a button and have the AI spit out a novel, it does take a lot of the effort and brain power out of writing a novel.\n\nWhen the tool first came out, I created a whole video outlining what it can do. Check that out here:\n\nIf you want more videos like this talking about the practical uses of AI in writing and marketing, be sure to subscribe to the channel.\n\nFirst, let‚Äôs start with what most people are probably interested in: the writing tools. These are the tools that are best for longer-form writing.\n\nIn other words, if you‚Äôre hoping to use Sudowrite to actually help you write the first draft of your manuscript, this is what you want to look at.\n\nFirst Draft: This is perhaps my favorite feature, and the one that (as AI improves) is likely to be the most important. With First Draft, you simply add in your description of a scene, and Sudowrite will write up to 1000 words for you. And it does a decent job. Not perfect, but enough that I can get started editing and adding my own flare to it. I almost always start with this first, then edit from there.\n\nGuided and Auto Write: These two options are how you continue writing each subsequent section of your story. With Guided Write, you can add a sentence or two about what happens next, and Sudowrite will take that and generate up to 250 words. Auto Write is similar, but without the guidance, meaning you can just see where it goes.\n\nTone Shift: This is a handy feature that allows you to change the tone of your story. A pretty simple but often needed feature.\n\nExpand: Let‚Äôs say you have a paragraph that quickly covers some action, and you want to expand that moment to include more detailed descriptions, or perhaps more dialogue, etc. The Expand feature is perfect for that. It‚Äôs probably the feature I use most after First Draft and Guided Write.\n\nRevision is one of those things that AI is pretty good at these days, and you can see that in action with these tools. These are the tools I will often use once I already have my manuscript in decent shape, or after importing my own manuscript from elsewhere.\n\nRewrite: The Rewrite feature is one of my favorites. It lets you rewrite any text to either Rephrase the text, make it shorter, more descriptive, to show instead of tell, add more inner conflict, or make the text more intense. I especially love using the ‚ÄúShow not Tell‚Äù feature, since AI often tells too much, I can easily select those passages and fix them. You can also customize your Rewrite to conform to any specific prompts you might want to give it.\n\nDescribe: I‚Äôm personally horrible at descriptions. They say you should try to use as many senses as possible when describing, but I‚Äôm barely able to get one. With Sudowrite, you can highlight a section you want to describe in more detail, and it will do so using all five senses, plus some metaphors. This is a very useful tool for expanding my descriptions.\n\nHere is one area where Sudowrite shines. They have a ton of different ways to brainstorm your novel or different elements of it.\n\nThe way each of these work is the AI will generate a list of things like names, dialogue, attributes, etc. It‚Äôs a giant list builder, and it does so in each of the following categories:\n\nDialogue\n\nCharacters\n\nWorld Building\n\nPlot Points\n\nNames\n\nPlaces\n\nObjects\n\nDescriptions\n\nArticle Ideas\n\nTweets\n\nSomething Else (a custom field where you can ask the tool to brainstorm just about anything)\n\nI‚Äôve found these to be very useful, if only to get my creative juices flowing. I might not even use the items I‚Äôm given, but sometimes I‚Äôll pick a piece of one, combine it with something else, and have a much better idea of what I want.\n\nOverall a great tool.\n\nBeyond the writing, editing, and brainstorming, there were a few unique tools that I really loved that don‚Äôt fit in some of the other categories:\n\nVisualize: Sudowrite has some visual integrations that allow you to use AI to generate images of parts of your manuscript. All you have to do is highlight a portion of your story and click on visualization and it will add something. If you don‚Äôt use an AI Art generator like Midjourney, this can be a fun option.\n\nShrink Ray: The Shrink Ray is a powerful feature. It takes everything in your current document (not the entire manuscript) and generates 2 loglines, a blurb, a synopsis, and an outline.\n\nTwist: The twist is one of my favorite features, because I‚Äôm horrible at coming up with good twists. Like the brainstorming features, this is a great one to get the juices flowing. You add a brief summary of your plot, and it gives you ideas for good plot twists you can use.\n\nPoem: This is exactly what it sounds like. You enter in your topic, and an optional number of seed lines, and it does the rest.\n\nThemes: Sudowrite not only has a dark mode, but has several other visual themes that you can use. I personally prefer Aurora Borealis.\n\nCanvas\n\nIn Sudowrite‚Äôs Canvas area, you have the option of adding a lot of your own notes. It‚Äôs kind of like a blank wall where you can post your virtual sticky notes related to plot or character.\n\nYou can create notes on virtually anything. They have some examples of character, but you could theoretically use the notes for worldbuilding, locations, and a lot more. Plus you can use AI to help you populate your notes and flesh them out further.\n\nPersonally, I find the Canvas to be a little disorganized and difficult to manage, but it is in beta as of this writing, so there may be improvements coming. And I understand that being an author and planning a book can be chaotic, so I know that some authors probably appreciate the open-endedness of Canvas.\n\nThere is, however, one feature in Canvas that I love:\n\nOutlining\n\nWithin Canvas, you have the option of creating an outline. Sudowrite provides you a variety of templates, at which point you can enter in the summary of your story, and it will generate an outline for you within that template.\n\nYou can have the entire outline populate from your summary, or you can move one step at a time, fixing/editing your outline as you go, before moving onto the next step.\n\nIt‚Äôs actually pretty cool if you play around with it. I mentioned above that AI is good at outlining, and you can see the truth of that in this feature.\n\nPros: What I Liked About Sudowrite\n\nSo now that we‚Äôve discussed all the features, let‚Äôs talk about the ones I really like, and that make this program stand out to me.\n\nFirst draft: This is my favorite feature, and saves the most time for me. I believe the quality of the AI output will only get better as time goes on. In an ideal universe, you would be able to hit this button and it would create a mostly clean chapter based on your description. We‚Äôre not there yet, but we‚Äôre not too far either.\n\nThe expand feature: Another great feature that, next to First Draft, is one of the best ways to get new words down that you can then edit.\n\nBrainstorming features: There‚Äôs so much here that I can‚Äôt really say I will ever have problems coming up with ideas again.\n\nThe outlining feature: I love this. There is something incredibly satisfying at entering your story treatment, and getting a genuinely good outline in return. I‚Äôll be using AI to aid my outlines for the foreseeable future.\n\nRewrite: Rewrite is a game-changer, especially some of the different options like the ‚Äúshow don‚Äôt tell‚Äù rewrite feature. Since many authors struggle with this (and AI does too, honestly), having a way to directly target passages that are telling too much is a huge headache-saver.\n\nTwist feature: Like the outline tool, sometimes it helps to have a way to brainstorm twists in the plot. This feature has produced a number of genuinely good twists that I was able to use or adapt to my book.\n\nCons: What I Didn‚Äôt Like About Sudowrite\n\nDespite the many good things that Sudowrite has going for it. There are a few things that I would like to see improved.\n\nCan be overwhelming: While I applaud Sudowrite for its massive list of features, sometimes it feels a little too much. Something I would like to see is a massively-simplified interface that I could use while doing the actual writing. I find that having to select between all of the different tools pulls me out of my flow state that I need to write. Having something a little more streamlined, and that requires fewer clicks, might help with focus. As it stands now, it feels a bit bloated.\n\nCanvas needs more structure: As it currently stands, I found Canvas to be more overwhelming than helpful. There‚Äôs no structure to help you list your characters, worldbuilding, etc. I think it would be better to have some kind of Story Bible feature where you can create various entries of each one. But that might just be my style. The outlining portion is great, but doesn‚Äôt seem to fit the Canvas setting well.\n\nThe good news is, the Sudowrite team is very responsive to critiques and is constantly putting out new features.\n\nIn fact, there was one that I asked for (being able to have 1 card generated instead of 2-6) that had already been added by the time I started writing this review.\n\nBest Book Marketing Software\n\nOver 47,000+ authors, NYT bestsellers, and publishing companies use Publisher Rocket to gain key insight to the market. Help your book now\n\nGet Rocket Now\n\nThe Bottom Line: Is Sudowrite Worth It?\n\nSudowrite is, in my experience, the best AI tool for fiction authors on the market.\n\nIt‚Äôs certainly not the only tool out there that fiction authors can use. ChatGPT, Claude and the OpenAI Playground show some promise. But these tools usually require a better understanding of prompt engineering and how AI works.\n\nSudowrite, on the other hand, will hold your hand through the entire process.\n\nOverall, I think its massive collection of features, combined with a select few like the Story Engine feature, make it well-positioned as a fantastic fiction writing program.",

      "# [Sudowrite Review (2024): As Good As A Human? by Jamie Giggs on 2024-03-15](https://bloggingwizard.com/sudowrite-review/)\nWelcome to our Sudowrite review.\n\nSudowrite is an AI writing tool that helps writers finish their manuscripts.\n\nThe platform features a story engine, rewrite functionality, and is able to provide feedback as you progress.\n\nThe key question: is it worth your time?\n\nBy the end of this review, you‚Äôll know the answer, including whether it suits your specific needs.\n\nWe‚Äôll dive into Sudowrite‚Äôs capabilities, explore the plans available, and detail what we think are the software‚Äôs main pros and cons.\n\nWhat is Sudowrite?\n\nSudowrite is an AI writing tool founded in 2020 by science fiction writers Amit Gupta and James Yu.\n\nAs writers themselves, Amit and James knew all too well the pain that writers experience when rewriting their beloved manuscripts for the 1000th time (trust me, I‚Äôve been there!).\n\nThe pair wanted to create software that broke through writer‚Äôs block and invented narrative twists for the user, so writers spent less time dreading the process (and contemplating reality itself) and more time actually writing.\n\nThe result of their efforts? A tool that, at its best, can effectively deliver cogent paragraphs of text that can inspire you to keep writing. One that‚Äôs used by over 12,000 novelists, screenwriters, and storytellers.\n\nThat said, is it enough to become your AI writing tool of choice, or should you continue to push on without the help of a machine?\n\nContinue reading for our full review of Sudowrite. I‚Äôll discuss the pros and cons and a few alternatives, too.\n\nWhat features does Sudowrite offer?\n\nSudowrite is a popular AI writing tool. The key features worth knowing about include:\n\nAI writer\n\nRewriter\n\nDescribe\n\nBrainstorm\n\nPoem generator\n\nCustomer support\n\nIntegrations\n\nWe‚Äôll explore these features and give you a first-hand look at the tool.\n\nPlease note: Some of Sudowrite‚Äôs features are only available in specific pricing plans.\n\nGetting started\n\nOnce you‚Äôve logged into Sudowrite, you‚Äôll be taken to a screen that looks like this:\n\nIt‚Äôs here where you‚Äôll be able to use the central features of the AI writing tool.\n\nIt‚Äôs worth noting that there‚Äôs also a ‚Äútour‚Äù feature that takes you through the basics (if need be).\n\nAI writer\n\nTo start using the AI writer, you‚Äôll first need to give it something to work with. This isn‚Äôt a couple of words either; the tool requires at least 20 words or more before the cursor.\n\nThere are two ways you can do this: putting in the required 20 words and clicking Write, or turning on the Story Bible (formerly Sudowrite‚Äôs story engine) like so:\n\nEssentially, using the Story Bible makes the tool more accurate because you fill in the key details yourself. Those key details include the synopsis of your novel, the style you want it to be written in, details of the main characters, the genre, and, if you can provide it, a general outline of your story by chapter.\n\nThere‚Äôs also a section called Braindump. This is where you can put in any extra details and in any form you want, whether that‚Äôs a stream-of-consciousness word salad or just a few sentences.\n\nBefore we take a look at the results of the Story Bible mode, let‚Äôs see what the regular mode can produce.\n\nI asked the tool to start writing a novel based on a jaded teacher who explores the origins of a portal. Here‚Äôs a snippet of what it came up with:\n\n‚ÄúAs Angus trudged along the rugged path in the Scottish Highlands, his mind was clouded with a sense of melancholy. The weight of his monotonous existence as a jaded teacher seemed to grow heavier with each passing day. He had lost the spark that once ignited his passion for education, leaving him with an empty heart and a hollow soul.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs not bad. Sudowrite has focused on the key elements of the story, including the jaded teacher, and chosen a good setting for him to explore. There‚Äôs quite a bit of telling here, though, rather than showing, so it would definitely need editing. That said, it may well be a good starting point if I needed an idea I could run with.\n\nWe can choose to Insert this text into the main editor, and from there, we can edit it as required. That said, it‚Äôs more of a summary piece of text than an actual chapter of a novel, which takes us back to the Story Bible mode.\n\nIf we fill out the details like character, setting, and provide a synopsis for our novel, we can get Sudowrite to create the first draft of a chapter. I input the details, and this was the result of the opening of Chapter 1:\n\n‚ÄúIn the bustling city of New York, Angus, a young journalist, begins to notice strange occurrences in the local government. He starts to collect information for a story, but the closer he gets to the truth, the more he is warned to stay away.‚Äù\n\nIt sounds pretty engaging, although it‚Äôs worth mentioning that the tool struggled to fill out the rest of the chapter and has changed our main character, Angus, to a young journalist living in New York. What‚Äôs here is good, but the details aren‚Äôt exactly what I asked for.\n\nThat being said, the tool can go further. I asked it to expand the text, and it came up with the next 15 chapters.\n\nFor example, in Chapter 5, Angus meets a man named Jeff, who trains him in self-defense, hacking, and espionage techniques. Angus also learns about the history of mind-control technology and how it‚Äôs been secretly developed over decades.\n\nThe rest of the outline is relatively decent and would certainly help an author during the preliminary stages of planning their novel. As a way of generating ideas, it‚Äôs solid.\n\nI asked the tool again to expand the first chapter, and here‚Äôs one of the opening paragraphs:\n\n‚ÄúA woman‚Äôs voice chimed in, her tone icy and detached, ‚Äòwe discovered that our suspicions were correct‚Äîthe government has been conducting experiments on innocent civilians.‚Äô She paused for effect, her breath frosting as it met the frigid air. ‚ÄòNot just any experiments, though. They‚Äôre trying to create‚Ä¶monsters.‚Äô\n\n‚Äú‚ÄòMonsters?‚Äô Angus echoed, his voice barely above a whisper. His mind raced with horrifying images, each one more grotesque than the last. Unwillingly, he recalled the eerie stories his grandmother used to tell him as a child, stories he had long dismissed as mere folklore.‚Äù\n\nAs an opener, this definitely lures the reader in. However, the story is a little basic and seems to involve the government creating ‚Äúmonsters.‚Äù As it goes on, some of the text lacks the depth I‚Äôd expect from a published novel, and it does come across as somewhat amateur.\n\nThat said, we can choose to add this text to the editor and refine it from there:\n\nOverall, the AI writer, albeit far from perfect, is a great way to bounce story ideas around.\n\nRewriter\n\nSudowrite‚Äôs Rewriter feature is a useful addition to the suite. Clicking the Rewrite button allows us to change bits of text we‚Äôre not happy with and even alter the writing style:\n\nFor the first paragraph of Chapter 1, I asked the tool to rewrite it in a more descriptive style. Here‚Äôs a snippet of the result:\n\n‚ÄúThe narrow alleyway loomed before Angus, its walls closing in on him as he approached the designated meeting spot. The air felt thick and heavy, like a looming sense of danger that threatened to suffocate him.\n\nHis heart thudded heavily against his ribcage, matching the rhythm of his quickened steps. Beads of sweat gathered at his temples, despite the biting cold that seeped into his bones. He questioned his sanity for getting involved with this dangerous conspiracy, but there was no turning back now.‚Äù\n\nWe can see that, in no time at all, more adjectives have been added to the text. The text, as a whole, now feels more engaging and works better as a pacey opener to what I would imagine would be a cross between mystery and thriller.\n\nWe can choose to rephrase the text if we‚Äôre unsure about the result simply by clicking Rephrase. Here‚Äôs that same paragraph reworked:\n\n‚ÄúAngus felt the walls of the dim alleyway closing in on him as he made his way towards the predetermined meeting spot. His heart pounded against his chest and sweat formed on his forehead, despite the frigid air. He couldn‚Äôt help but question his own judgment for getting involved in this dangerous scheme, but it was too late to turn back now.‚Äù\n\nAs you can see, a selection of words have been changed, with others moved around. Sudowrite provides you with variants of the rewrite. For instance, if I scroll down the page, I can see a more descriptive version of the rewrite, one that‚Äôs another rephrase, and an additional descriptive version, giving me plenty of choice.\n\nI can also use the rewrite functionality to add more in the way of showing rather than telling to the piece. All good writers know the importance of getting these two right, and it‚Äôs great to see an option to cut down on some of that intrusive telling. Here‚Äôs the result:\n\n‚ÄúThe narrow alley was shrouded in darkness as Angus cautiously made his way towards the designated meeting spot. The cold air stung his cheeks and he could feel his heart pounding against his chest.\n\nHis palms were slick with sweat, a mixture of nerves and fear. As he approached the figure standing in the shadows, he couldn‚Äôt help but question his judgement for getting involved in this dangerous scheme. But it was too late to turn back.‚Äù\n\nThe cold air stinging his cheeks creates a strong image in our mind, and it‚Äôs a more powerful way of showing the reader that it‚Äôs cold. That said, I‚Äôm not sure we need to even say it‚Äôs cold. We could show that further, although that‚Äôs a story for another time.\n\nAll in all, the rewrite functionality impressed me, and while I wouldn‚Äôt rely on it solely, it could serve as a way to get me writing again.\n\nDescribe\n\nLeaving Angus and the government monster scheme behind, another notable feature of Sudowrite is the Describe feature. We can activate it like so:\n\nWe simply highlight a word or phrase we want to describe, and Sudowrite will give us suggestions based on all five senses‚Äìthis includes the use of metaphors.\n\nKeeping to the theme, I highlighted the word ‚ÄúMonster,‚Äù and this was what the tool produced for sight:\n\n‚ÄúThe monster‚Äôs body was a tangle of twisted limbs, each one ending in sharp claws that glinted in the dim light. Its skin was a sickly pale color, almost translucent, and covered in pulsating veins.‚Äù\n\nHere‚Äôs what it generated for smell:\n\n‚ÄúThe stench of decay surrounds the monster, a mixture of rotting flesh and damp earth. Its breath reeks of death and its presence fills the air with a nauseating odor.‚Äù\n\nQuite vivid. Here‚Äôs another for taste:\n\n‚ÄúThe thought of tasting the monster‚Äôs flesh made one‚Äôs stomach churn. It was said that those who had tried had described it as a foul combination of dirt, mold, and something unidentifiable yet repulsive.‚Äù\n\nIn terms of metaphors, Sudowrite generated this:\n\n‚ÄúThe monster was born of shadows and whispers, a creature of the night with eyes that glowed like embers and a roar that could shatter even the bravest of hearts. Its terrifying form was both primordial and otherworldly, a reminder of the dark secrets that lurk within us all.‚Äù\n\nThe senses are better than the metaphor. Still, it‚Äôs a helpful addition to get the neurons firing.\n\nBrainstorm\n\nWhat about those times when you just need writing ideas in general, whether it‚Äôs character names, settings, or even plot points? Well, Sudowrite does have a feature that can help.\n\nIt‚Äôs located here:\n\nOnce we‚Äôve clicked that, we‚Äôre taken to an attractive-looking grid:\n\nIt‚Äôs here where we can pick the specific part of writing we need help with. As a fan of great world-building myself, I chose to see what Sudowrite could do in that department. Here‚Äôs the result:\n\n‚ÄúA mysterious black stone found only in the depths of the ocean, it glows with a faint blue light and has been known to give its owner the power to control minds.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs a strange derivative, considering I asked the tool to describe a fantasy world. I tried again, and here was the second result:\n\n‚ÄúThe Phantom‚Äôs Touch: An illegal substance created from the ashes of a being from a different dimension, it gives the user the ability to phase through objects and render themselves invisible for a short period of time.‚Äù\n\nWhile I like the description here, I asked the tool to do something else. I played some more with it and found that Sudowrite prefers to describe items within the fictional world rather than the world itself.\n\nNot the best result here.\n\nI tried asking the tool to create some names for an island nation inhabited by warriors. The results:\n\nThundercliff\n\nSavage Coast\n\nValoria\n\nShieldhaven\n\nShield Isle\n\nA better result overall, although it‚Äôs clear Sudowrite does have its limitations.\n\nPoem generator\n\nPoem lovers will be pleased to know that Sudowrite can create poems. I asked it to create a poem on danger, and here‚Äôs the first paragraph of what it came up with:\n\nBullets for Breakfast\n\nIn the land of the free, we sip coffee and load our guns\n\nWe cook our eggs and fry our bacon,\n\nButter our toast and oil our guns\n\nWe kiss our loved ones goodbye and holster our guns\n\nIt‚Äôs a decent result, if a tad nonsensical.\n\nI asked it to create a second poem on writing itself:\n\nThe Muse‚Äôs Gift\n\nIt comes in waves, this gift of words\n\nSometimes a trickle, sometimes a flood\n\nA turn of phrase, a thought profound\n\nWords from my muse, my pen unbound\n\nA better result.\n\nHow much mileage you‚Äôll get out of the poem generator will depend on your needs, but it‚Äôs a respectable extra.\n\nCustomer support\n\nSudowrite does feature customer support, albeit one that isn‚Äôt that extensive.\n\nBy clicking the question mark symbol on the dashboard, you‚Äôll be able to reach the team via email, live chat, or you can, instead, consult the FAQ guide:\n\nThe FAQs are simple but get the job done with some (fairly) thorough answers.\n\nThe live chat loaded up quickly, although I did have to wait some time before a member of the team could answer my query. Clicking the Support button at the bottom of the page will also bring up the live chat.\n\nFinally, there‚Äôs the ability to suggest new features to the team‚Äìsomething I thought was welcome.\n\nIntegrations\n\nSudowrite‚Äôs integrations are currently limited. The tool integrates with Google Docs, Invoice2go, and Airtable.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nSudowrite comes in three main tiers: Hobby & Student, Professional, and Max. Naturally, each plan includes differing features, benefits, and usage limits.\n\nLet‚Äôs take a closer look at each of them.\n\nSudowrite‚Äôs Hobby & Student plan starts at $10 per month on the yearly plan or $19 on the monthly plan. It includes 225,000 credits per month.\n\nA credit is based on the AI model and how many words it reads and writes for you. This plan comes with a free trial, and no credit card is required. It‚Äôs aimed at people who write for fun or for school and need help with the writing process. There‚Äôs enough here for a story idea or two, and the twist feature is available.\n\nSudowrite‚Äôs Professional plan starts at $22 per month on the yearly plan or $29 on the monthly plan. It currently includes 1,000,000 credits per month (although this is subject to change). This plan comes with a free trial, and no credit card is required. It‚Äôs intended for those who want to write a novel or screenplay using AI tools. Note the Story Engine feature for writing stories is now known as the Story Bible.\n\nSudowrite‚Äôs Max plan starts at $44 per month on the yearly plan or $59 on the monthly plan. It includes 2,000,000 credits per month. It‚Äôs aimed at prolific authors who publish multiple novels and screenplays a year and need to keep their creative juices flowing.\n\nPros and cons\n\nSudowrite is a well-designed AI writing assistant for story writing, but it also has its weaknesses. Here‚Äôs a brief round-up of what we thought were the biggest pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\nAI writer. It‚Äôs not perfect, but the AI tool can successfully create text for your novel, whether that‚Äôs a chapter summary or the entire chapter itself. This can be achieved in a few minutes if you have the necessary credits.\n\nRewriter functionality. The option to rewrite paragraphs and include more showing (and less telling) is here. You can also add in extra description or make sentences more intense. This is perhaps the most useful part for full-time writers.\n\nWriting senses generator. Sudowrite can generate descriptions for each of the five senses based on a single word or phrase. You can also get it to produce metaphors of varying quality. It‚Äôs a helpful feature.\n\nCons\n\nAffordability. The tool could be cheaper, and the credits won‚Äôt last long if you‚Äôre attempting a full novel of 70,000+ words.\n\nLack of integrations. There are very few integrations at the time of writing, although we do expect this to change over time.\n\nCustomer support. What‚Äôs here is serviceable, but it‚Äôs not outstanding. There isn‚Äôt much in the way of additional support should you need it.\n\nAlternatives\n\nNeed to look at some alternatives? Check out our recommended AI writing tools before we head to our Sudowrite review conclusion:\n\nRytr | Our review ‚Äî A fantastic all-round AI writer with additional generative AI capabilities. With an AI image generator that punches above its weight, exclusive writing profiles for copywriters, and over 40 different use cases, including emails, poems, and video descriptions, the value for money speaks for itself.\n\nFrase | Our review ‚Äî One of the best AI content creation and writing tools available with a lot of hidden functionality within its features.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThat concludes our Sudowrite review.\n\nOverall, Sudowrite allows you to quickly generate text for your novel or screenplay in a few clicks.\n\nWhile it may not be able to produce chapters without edits or come up with the most original prose, most aspiring writers will absolutely find its ability to bounce ideas around useful.\n\nThe rewrite functionality, in particular, is easy to use and, in the right scenario, will break through even the most stubborn writer‚Äôs block.\n\nWe recommend you give any of the free plans a try to see if it‚Äôs the best AI writing tool for you.",

Further, they‚Äôve gone and suggested that condemning generative AI is classist, ableist, and privileged.\n\nI‚Äôll keep this as short and sweet as I can ‚Äî\n\nThe privileged viewpoint is the viewpoint in favor of generative AI. The intrusion of generative artificial intelligence into art and writing suits one group and one group only: the fucking tech companies that invented this pernicious, insidious shit. They very much want you to relinquish your power in creating art and telling stories to them and their software, none of which are essential or even useful in the process of telling stories or making art but that they really, really want you to believe are essential. It‚Äôs a lie, a scam, a con. Generative AI empowers not the artist, not the writer, but the tech industry. It steals content to remake content, graverobbing existing material to staple together its Frankensteinian idea of art and story. And in stealing the material, by making that theft and regurgitation easy and effortless ‚Äî so easy and so effortless that the essential human component of creation is extracted entirely from the process! ‚Äî it limits the quality and value of art, watering it all down and turning it all to a soylent slurry. A valueless soylent slurry, which means, conveniently, that companies can pay little to nothing for art and content going forward because they can either just hit a button to have it shit out its gross recombination of stolen material, or, realizing that the stolen material is garbage, they can just say, ‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôll pay you less, because otherwise we‚Äôll just hit this stupid button for free.‚Äù The privilege here is on the tech companies and on NaNoWriMo. Art is for humans. Story is for humans. They are its makers, they are its witnesses.\n\nYou can be sure if you give NaNoWriMo any of your material, they are going to be feeding it to the artbarf robots to become just more shitty artbarf.\n\nLet them push buttons and have robots tell stories to feed to other robots.\n\nWe humans can all stay far the fuck away from it. We can gather around the campfire and tell our stories to each other. True no matter who we are. Though the industry is often unfair (and classist, and ableist, and privileged) the act of telling stories is universal, and has existed as long as we have. (I‚Äôm sure Homer would have something to say about all this.)\n\n(Er, the ancient Greek, not the cartoon doofus.)\n\nAnyway.\n\nIf you want some good news, it‚Äôs that NaNoWriMo and generative AI have one very important thing in common:\n\nYou don‚Äôt need either of them to tell a good story.",
      "# [5+ Generative AI Writing Tools Everyone Should Know About by Bernard Marr on 2024-03-06](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/03/06/5-generative-ai-writing-tools-everyone-should-know-about/)\nOne of the most popular use cases for generative AI is writing. This is thanks to the ability of tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to create any kind of text, from poetry and fiction to technical documents.\n\nTheir ability to understand context and mimic any human writing style in order to create comprehensive content on any subject is probably their most impressive ability right now.\n\nIt's worth remembering, however, that these large language model (LLM) tools are, for the most part, limited to constructing text based on their training data. This means it isn't necessarily great at communicating new ideas or writing in a way that will grip the attention of a human audience.\n\nBut when it comes to brainstorming, drafting, structuring, researching and fact-checking, it can be a powerful tool that can save time and effort for anyone who needs to create written content.\n\nIt can also speed up all manner of routine, day-to-day writing, such as drafting emails or creating product descriptions for e-commerce businesses.\n\nFive Of My Favorite Generative AI Writing Tools\n\nThe most well-known generative AI tools are all capable of creating written text. But here, I'm focusing on those that specifically provide features and functions designed to assist with writing. These are some of the most useful and interesting players on the field right now:\n\nJasper\n\nJasper was one of the first specialist generative AI writing tools, positioning itself as a solution for marketers needing to create copy in a hurry. It provides templates that speed up the process of generating blogs, social media posts or product listings.\n\nThis gives it an advantage over more general-purpose genAI tools that often start you off on a blank page and require careful prompting if you want them to follow a process to create multiple pieces of writing. It also adapts to its user's style and voice over time.\n\nAnother advantage over general-purpose tools (like ChatGPT) is that Jasper doesn't rely on any one language model. While its output is powered by OpenAI‚Äôs models, including GPT-4, it is also reported to use models created by Google, Anthropic and more. Jasper isn‚Äôt the cheapest option on the market, but it stands out by providing a tailored set of solutions for marketing-focused writers.\n\nSudowrite\n\nOne thing that sets Sudowrite apart is that it is tailored specifically for fiction writers. So, if you‚Äôre looking for an AI that might help you write the next Game Of Thrones, it could be the right choice for you!\n\nSudowrite is built around tools that can help fiction authors, such as brainstorming aids, restructuring sentences to make them more readable or exciting, and providing detailed feedback on their own writing. It is designed to understand concepts such as audiences and genres, as well as what makes a piece of writing engaging for an audience to read. Not sure where your story‚Äôs going? Simply hit the Write button and have it continue the tale, giving you options to choose from and mimicking your own tone and voice!\n\nAnyword\n\nAnyword is focused on what it calls \"performance content,\" content designed to sell, generate clicks or encourage audiences to take some other form of action.\n\nIt includes a ‚Äúpredicted performance‚Äù stat that attempts to forecast how well your piece of content will go down with your audience. The aim is to automate the data analytics that marketers use when creating and publishing content at the point of writing in order to encourage greater engagement.\n\nUnlike some of the other options here, this is marketed firmly as a business solution and isn't the best choice for hobby writers or those starting a small business marketing strategy from scratch. It‚Äôs accessed via an API rather than a friendly chatbot web interface.\n\nBut for established companies who have plenty of data and an established content pipeline that want to start leveraging AI-driven analytics, it‚Äôs a good option.\n\nCanva Magic Write\n\nOkay, so this one isn't a standalone writing tool. It‚Äôs the writing element of the versatile cloud-based design platform Canva that has recently added a ton of AI functionality under the heading Magic.\n\nAs you might expect, this one is mostly geared toward writing as an element of design rather than creating plain, long-form text. This means it's optimized for creating marketing emails, social media ads and advertising copy. I particularly like the way it lets you adjust the tone of your text. This is stuff that you‚Äôd need to dive into prompt engineering in order to do if you‚Äôre relying on something like ChatGPT or Gemini to write marketing copy. One of the differences when using a specialized platform is that this kind of use case-specific function is built into the user interface, so it's always at your fingertips.\n\nGrammarly\n\nGrammarly has been around for a long time and has always been marketed as an AI typing assistant. But a major overhaul last year saw the introduction of Grammarly GO, its generative AI-augmented service. Currently still in beta but available to most users, GO uses large language algorithms to provide content suggestions and synonyms and to suggest better ways of saying what you want to say.\n\nIt isn‚Äôt a standalone tool that will churn out long-form content on its own, but rather a plugin that can be integrated into software from word processors to web browsers ‚Äì anywhere you might want to write text. It also scores your text for readability, detects plagiarism and gives automated guidance on word choice and sentence structure. It may not get mentioned in so many news reports as newer players like ChatGPT or Google Gemini, but as an all-around writing assistant for the sort of writing that most people do every day, it's hard to beat.\n\nOther Great Generative AI Writing Tools\n\nThere are many other apps, tools and platforms that also specialize in writing, so here‚Äôs a quick overview of the rest!\n\nAI Writer\n\nWrites content like blog posts while citing its sources to help overcome issues of AI hallucination.\n\nChibi\n\nChibi aims to give users deeper control over the AI writing process, creating personalized workflows rather than relying on templates.\n\nContent At Scale\n\nGeared for creating human-like written content for marketing purposes.\n\nCopy.ai\n\nContent creation tool aimed at businesses and enterprises, with built-in templates for common jobs.\n\nCopymatic\n\nAI copywriting tool that specializes in website copy, blogs and social media posts for businesses or hobbyists.\n\nCopysmith\n\nCopysmith‚Äôs Describely tool is a very useful application optimized for using AI to write product descriptions for e-commerce.\n\nFraze\n\nThis one provides feedback on grammar and clarity of your writing, and also optimizes copy for SEO purposes.\n\nFriday\n\nA collaborative writing assistant focused on simplifying content production with tools for brainstorming as well as templates.\n\nHemingway\n\nDesigned to help writers create clear, concise and to-the-point writing in an active voice, much like Hemmingway himself.\n\nHyperWrite\n\nWriting assistant with a comprehensive toolbox of AI features to help tackle a variety of writing tasks.\n\nInk\n\nAuto-generate SEO-optimized content to improve ranking in search engines.\n\nLex\n\nAn AI co-pilot for writers offering AI feedback on your work and tools for finding the right words or expressions or generating ideas.\n\nLongshot\n\nCreate more long-form content that differentiates by promising zero hallucinations.\n\nNovelAI\n\nDesigned to help would-be novelists get their ideas out of their heads and onto the page.\n\nOutwrite\n\nAnother extension-based assistant that plugs into your favorite software and offers in-line automated assistance as you work.\n\nProWritingAid\n\nA writing mentor for professionals, offering in-depth analysis of style and readability with the aim of creating elegant prose.\n\nQuillbot\n\nQuillbot bills itself as a paraphraser tool to help writers find a better way of phrasing something.\n\nRytr\n\nGenerates blogs, emails, social media posts, SEO headlines and ads.\n\nScribe\n\nAutomates the creation of documentation, step-by-step and how-to guides.\n\nSEO.AI\n\nThis one focuses on streamlining and automating SEO-related tasks, cutting down the need for manual keyword research.\n\nTextmetrics\n\nProvides feedback on grammar, style and clarity in order to improve the user‚Äôs writing.\n\nTextio\n\nTextio is an AI writing assistant specifically designed for HR writing, automating the process of creating performance feedback and assessments.\n\nWordtune\n\nGenerative writing assistant aimed at professionals.\n\nWriter\n\nThis one uses an open-source LLM that has only been trained on freely distributable writing data in order to avoid copyright infringement issues.\n\nWriteSonic\n\nGeared towards creating SEO content and traffic-boosting copy.",
      "# [9 of the Best AI Writing Tools to Help You Work Smarter, Not Harder](https://buffer.com/resources/ai-writing-tools/)\nFrom brainstorming ideas, creating outlines, repurposing content ‚Äî AI can make your job as a writer a whole lot easier.\n\nArtificial intelligence is not going to do your best work for you, of course. We know there‚Äôs (thankfully?) still work to be done in replicating the weirdness and wonder of human creativity. But AI can take some of the work off your plate, so you can focus on exactly that: creating.\n\nHowever, with the ever-growing list of AI software and tools on the market ‚Äî all promising to help you generate, streamline, and automate your writing process ‚Äî it can be tricky to figure out which ones are worth your time (and money).\n\nWhich is where I come in. I‚Äôm a productivity nerd who loves testing out new tools, and I‚Äôve put dozens of AI writing assistants to the test in the hope of working smarter, not harder.\n\nMy ultimate goal is to remove the admin and repetition from my to-do list as a writer so I can focus on what brings me joy. (The creating part, as you may have guessed.)\n\nIn this article, I‚Äôll take a deep dive into my favorite AI writing generators and who I think they‚Äôll be most useful for.\n\nBefore we get into that, here is some context on how I use AI tools in my work.\n\nHow I use AI in my work\n\nAt Buffer, our approach to AI is simple: it‚Äôs a tool, not a replacement. You‚Äôll never find completely AI-generated content on Buffer‚Äôs blog, website, or the product itself ‚Äî a human reviews everything. (You can read more about how we use AI on the content team here.)\n\nThere are a plethora of ways to use AI tools in your content creation process, but here are some ways I‚Äôm using AI as a writer:\n\nGenerate ideas\n\nDraft article outlines\n\nRephrase paragraphs or phrases with a specific tone\n\nGenerate sentences or paragraphs when I‚Äôm hit with writer‚Äôs block (though I‚Äôll always fact-check, edit, or rewrite these)\n\nRepurpose blog posts into social media posts\n\nWrite silly poems I can share for friends‚Äô birthdays\n\nOK, that last one doesn‚Äôt exactly count as work, but it‚Äôs one of my favorite ways to use it.\n\nFor all of the above (and a few more tasks), these are the best AI writing tools I‚Äôve tested*.\n\n1. Buffer‚Äôs AI Assistant\n\nBest AI writing tool for social media content\n\nBuffer's AI Assistant was built for social media. You can use it as and when you create and schedule your content with Buffer, making the content creation process seamless (no more copy-pasting to various social networks ‚Äî especially tedious if you‚Äôre cross-posting to multiple platforms).\n\nThe best thing about Buffer‚Äôs AI Assistant is that it understands the nuances of each social media platform. For example, the content you create for X (formerly Twitter) won‚Äôt exceed your character limit. It‚Äôs also trained to make the tone of LinkedIn content more professional, Instagram more playful, and so on.\n\nAnother time-saving feature is the editing buttons within the assistant. Instead of having to type further instructions to the Assistant to tweak your post, just click Rephrase, Shorten, Expand, More casual, or More formal to get you closer to the content you‚Äôre after.\n\nYou can also use these buttons to tweak certain parts of your posts if you don‚Äôt want to rewrite the whole lot ‚Äî another time saver. (If you‚Äôre new to using AI in this way, this beginner‚Äôs guide to using AI for social media is a helpful read.)\n\nBeyond these fundamental features, here are some of my favorite use cases as a writer looking to create more content on social media and build my personal brand:\n\nPersonalized ideas\n\nIn my experience as a creator and social media manager, social media writer‚Äôs block is SO much worse than the regular kind. Perhaps it‚Äôs the sheer volume of content you have to create. Who knows.\n\nMercifully, I‚Äôve found Buffer‚Äôs AI Assistant, which means this is a thing of the past. When I‚Äôm stuck on what to post, I head over to Buffer‚Äôs Create Space (where I brain-dump all my post ideas) and click the Generate Ideas button.\n\nTo get a better sense of what is going to resonate with your audience, the assistant will ask you two things:\n\nWhat is your business about?\n\nWho is your target audience?\n\nFrom there, the Assistant will generate a stream of ideas for you to assess, one at a time. On each one, you‚Äôll be able to hit Use it, which will open a pre-filled post creation window, or Try another to regenerate.\n\nRepurpose other posts and content\n\nOne of the best use cases for this tool is the ability to repurpose content that has performed well or rewrite it to be more appropriate for another platform.\n\nI often use the latter to rework posts I‚Äôve created for LinkedIn into a Twitter thread (something that used to take me ages).\n\nSomething else I‚Äôm leaning into right now is repurposing older social media posts into something fresh. There‚Äôs a fair chance a huge chunk of my audience missed certain posts, and those who saw them likely won‚Äôt remember if they did (especially if the original post has been given a glow-up).\n\nI also use the AI Assistant to summarize entire blog posts I‚Äôve written into bite-sized social snippets ‚Äî another thing that used to take me ages.\n\nFree and limitless on all Buffer plans\n\nUnlike many other AI writer tools, especially those built for social media, there‚Äôs no ‚Äòcredits‚Äô system in place. The AI Assistant is free to use, as is Buffer (for up to three channels). When it comes to the number of prompts and rephrases you can submit, the limit does not exist!\n\nBonus: No-sign-up-required Social Media Post Creator\n\nYou don‚Äôt need to be a Buffer user to use the AI Assistant. With the free Social Media Post Creator, you can take the tool for a test run (or use it indefinitely) without creating an account or sharing your email address.\n\n2. Jasper\n\nBest AI writing tool for Marketing teams\n\nAs one of the first AI writing tools to market (then known as Jarvis), Jasper has had time to hone its UI and feature set.\n\nAlong with AI text generation for a plethora of specific projects ‚Äî everything from landing pages to full-on marketing campaigns, Jasper also boasts Remix (a dedicated tool for reworking content via a link, uploaded document, or text), Chat (a back-and-forth chat box with the AI to help you brainstorm or hone ideas), plus a Chrome extension.\n\nJasper has moved beyond just copywriting and now aims squarely at marketing teams. The collaborative features mean everyone can jump into various documents and view projects and campaigns at a glance with nifty Kanban and calendar views. Managers and editors can also add in things like brand voice and style guide documents to ensure things stay on track across all content pieces.\n\nWhen writing, Jasper‚Äôs intuitive system will ask you to enter a simple prompt or choose from a list of templates. From there, you‚Äôll be asked for more information upfront, which differs depending on what you‚Äôre working on. Before generating your draft, you can add things like your target audience, specific points to include, and more ‚Äî but the AI can predict these things so well that this usually just involves choosing from some recommended options.\n\nWhile Jasper is intuitive and great for teams, it‚Äôs worth noting that the foundation of the tool is the same as most of the other (cheaper) options on this list. Jasper ‚Äúuses over a dozen language models,‚Äù but the marketing copy generated is similar to what you‚Äôll get from ChatGPT and other AI writing software.\n\nPricing: 7-day trial, then prices start at $49 per month\n\n3. Copy.ai\n\nBest AI writing tool for automating repetitive writing tasks\n\nCopy.ai is another tool on this list that has outgrown the content generation mold it was born into. The multifaceted tool aims to help Sales and Marketing teams go from ‚Äúgo-to-market bloat to velocity.‚Äù\n\nWhat that means in practice is a slick tool a lot like Jasper. However, Copy.ai places more emphasis on repeatable workflows that will help save marketers (or salespeople) time ‚Äî think ‚Äúrepurpose this blog post into a LinkedIn post,‚Äù ‚ÄúCheck this copy for plagiarism,‚Äù or ‚ÄúFind prospects at company X.‚Äù\n\nYou can choose these workflows from an impressive library or customize your own. The finished product will look something like a flowchart, where each step in the process is effectively an AI prompt (or a series of them).\n\nIf you‚Äôre not bothered with workflows, you can jump straight into Chat, their AI content generator. It‚Äôs a lot like the usual prompt-and-generate system most AI tools use and requires lots of context to generate what you‚Äôre looking for ‚Äî which is why you might be better off getting the hang of the workflow system.\n\nLike Jasper, you can have Copy.ai assess your content to match your tone and style.\n\nPricing: Free version with limited features, paid plans starting at $49 per month.\n\n4. Writer\n\nBest AI writing tool for editing and improving your content\n\nWriter is a whole lot more than a simple AI text generator. Like Jasper and Copy.ai, the web tool is packed with more powerful features that take the tool beyond what ChatCPT can do ‚Äî but instead of workflows and systems, they‚Äôre called ‚ÄòApps.‚Äô\n\nThese apps, all baked into the web application, are things like ‚ÄòBlog Builder‚Äô (which will help you spin a blog post up out of a headline idea), ‚ÄòRecaps‚Äô (to convert a recording into a summary of key takeaways), and ‚ÄòAsk Writer‚Äô (the chat-style prompt-and-generate AI system you‚Äôll be familiar with). You‚Äôll also find apps to help you create product descriptions, push notifications, and help center articles.\n\nIt‚Äôs a neat and tidy system that‚Äôs a lot easier to get to grips with than Jasper and Copy.ai, and is squarely aimed at writers rather than marketers or sales folk. Writer‚Äôs interface, for example, looks a lot like Grammarly. Here, you‚Äôll see suggestions for improving grammar and readability, a plagiarism checker, and recommendations for improving language inclusivity.\n\nWriter is also a solid option for content teams, with a helpful terms list where you can save all your unique terms and saved snippets for copy you reuse often. You can also set specific punctuation rules, which is a helpful time saver for editors. Writing is one of my favorite tools for proofreading and editing existing content.\n\nWhat sets Writer apart from the other copywriting tools on the market is that it‚Äôs not built on GPT or other (sometimes controversial) AI models. Writer uses its own Palmyra Language Learning Models, specifically ‚Äútrained for business writing and business use cases,‚Äù offering higher security and transparency. For example, Writer says Palmyra does not store your proprietary data for training its foundational models.\n\nThat said, many of Writer‚Äôs most powerful tools ‚Äî like the ability to add your own brand and style guide ‚Äî are locked behind its enterprise-level paywall.\n\nPricing: 14-day free trial, then prices start at $18 per month. (There is a free plan, but it doesn‚Äôt allow much beyond text editing.)\n\n5. Hubspot Breeze\n\nBest AI writing tool to streamline business operations\n\nThink of HubSpot Breeze as the Swiss Army knife of AI tools. The platform helps marketers, sales reps, and customer service agents take out most of the grunt work that comes with their activities and boost their productivity.\n\nHubSpot Breeze handles anything from writing quick emails and social captions down to more complex tasks like generating website pages and summarizing CRM data into digestible reports. The way it does this is through Breeze Agents ‚Äî think of them as separate AI assistants, each specialized in its own department.\n\nFor example, the Content Agent generates blogs, landing pages, podcasts, and anything else content-related. Meanwhile, the Breeze Customer Agent handles basic customer service inquiries, offers reply suggestions, and compiles customer service data into visual reports.\n\nThere‚Äôs also the Breeze Co-pilot, which does a little bit of everything ‚Äî it can update CRM records, generate content, and summarize customer support tickets, for example.\n\nPricing: Breeze is available in HubSpot‚Äôs free starter suite as well as throughout HubSpot‚Äôs premium product offerings. Paid pricing starts at $15 per user per month.\n\n6. Sudowrite\n\nBest AI writing tool for creative writing and fiction\n\nIf, like me, you‚Äôve been threatening to write a novel for years, Sudowrite may soon become your new best friend. Not only will Sudowrite help you generate ideas and write stories for the characters you‚Äôve had floating around in your head for years, but it‚Äôs also an AI-powered project management tool of sorts specifically designed for fiction writers.\n\nAs for the writing itself, you‚Äôll start by entering the genre of your masterpiece-in-progress, then get cracking on the draft. Instead of entering a prompt, start by entering what you have. With a few sentences to start a chapter, click the ‚ÄòWrite‚Äô button, and the AI generator will suggest several options to keep moving the story forward. Highlight a word or phrase and hit ‚ÄòDescribe‚Äô to generate a description of the object based on each of the senses or a metaphor.\n\nThere‚Äôs also a ‚ÄòRewrite‚Äô button to help you paraphrase or rework something and a ‚ÄòBrainstorm‚Äô button to help get your creative juices flowing in specific directions, from characters to world-building to plot points.\n\nIf you‚Äôre not ready to jump right into chapter 1, you might want to play around with Sudowrite‚Äôs Story Engine, a space where you can go into more detail about your genre, characters, and outline, add more writing samples to help the AI match your style or just brain dump ideas.\n\nThen there‚Äôs Sudowrite‚Äôs Canvas ‚Äì a space for mind mapping your (and the AI‚Äôs) imaginings to give you a bird‚Äôs-eye view (and keep track of) the story you‚Äôre creating.\n\nSudowrite also boasts a handy Google Docs extension so you can work where you write best and a bustling Slack community of other Sudowrite users so you can bounce ideas off of humans from time to time.\n\nPricing: Credit-based free trial (for a certain amount of words generated), then prices start at $10 per month\n\n7. Type\n\nBest AI writing tool for a simple AI writing assistant\n\nType describes itself as an AI-first document editor. With the tool, you can create short and long-form content, from emails to YouTube scripts to cover letters.\n\nThe interface ‚Äî clean and user-friendly ‚Äî requires you to begin with a simple prompt to get you started. There‚Äôs a template library to tap into, which is handy for those moments when you just can‚Äôt face staring at a blank page (we‚Äôve all been there). From there, Type will generate a high-quality content draft, which you‚Äôre then encouraged to play with and make your own.\n\nType‚Äôs generative AI makes it really easy to do this with a host of different options ‚Äî for example, you can switch between OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4 and Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3. ‚ÄúClaude tends to be more creative and expressive but not quite as good at complex reasoning, whereas the GPT models are often much better at reasoning, but maybe a bit drier with tone,‚Äù Type Founder Stew Fortier explains in an onboarding video.\n\nThere‚Äôs also the ‚ÄòWhat to write about next‚Äô block, a handy springboard for anything you might want to add. The sidebar contains a list of suggestions related to whatever you‚Äôre working on that you can use to generate another paragraph. In the main editor, you can also- highlight specific sentences, paragraphs, or phrases and ask Type to rework them for you.\n\nAll the common options are available, but ‚ÄòCustom transform‚Äô is particularly handy, allowing you to ask the AI to do something really specific with your highlighted text.\n\nPricing: 14 days free, then $29.00 per month.\n\n8. SEOWind\n\nBest AI writing tool for SEO content briefs\n\nSEOWind is not a multi-purpose tool like many of the others on this ‚Äî it‚Äôs laser-focused SEO (search-engine optimized) content, making it a great tool for content marketing.\n\nAs such, SEOWind doesn‚Äôt ask you to enter a prompt to kick-start your writing but a primary search term. From there, it‚Äôll jump you to a fascinating dashboard that analyzes blog posts and pages already ranking for this term to help you create your ‚Äòbrief.‚Äô\n\nIn this build-you-brief dashboard, you‚Äôll see a competitor analysis (an overview of blog posts and pages already ranking in Google for your term), competitor outlines (the structure of their content), and questions to answer (related queries pulled from Google, Quora and Reddit). Along with this, the tool recommends the ideal word count, the number of headings, and even the number of images to include.\n\nWith this information at your fingertips, you can set about pulling bits and pieces to create your own brief, from which SEOWind‚Äôs AI will generate a draft for you to download in your format of choice ‚Äî from there, you‚Äôre left to edit the article on your own. While SEOWind makes briefs super customizable, there‚Äôs no way to edit and rework with AI once your draft is generated.\n\nAll briefs are saved within projects, where SEOWind encourages you to add details about your brand tone, details about your company and products, and even integrates with Google Search Console to help you find internal linking opportunities (one of the more tedious tick-boxes in SEO writing for sure!).\n\nPricing: 7-day trial, then prices start at $59 per month.\n\n9. ChatGPT\n\nBest free AI writing tool\n\nYou might be surprised to find ChatGPT in and amongst some of its more niche competitors, but I‚Äôd be remiss not to mention it here. As a free AI writing tool (for GPT-3, at least), ChatGPT is one I keep returning to for quick ideas, blog post outlines, and goofy metaphors.\n\nChatGPT, a chatbot based on Open AI‚Äôs GPT model, is what many of the bells-and-whistle-filled tools above are built on and what helps generate the copy that lands in their fancy interfaces.\n\nLearning to prompt ChatGPT takes some doing ‚Äî I tend to err on the side of providing as much context as possible ‚Äî but the chat-style interface can be helpful as you refine your ask and tweak prompts as you go.\n\nPricing: Free for the basic version, with paid plans starting at $10 per month\n\nWhile I‚Äôve tested many AI writing generators, I‚Äôm not an AI myself and, as such, can‚Äôt test them all. (In case you‚Äôre wondering, that cheesy simile was all mine.)\n\nIf there‚Äôs a tool out there that I have to put through its paces, I‚Äôd love to hear about it! Please comment below or tag @buffer or @bufferapp on all major social channels, and I‚Äôll put your favorite tool to the test.",
      "# [Sudowrite Review: Can AI Write a Novel That Sounds Human? by Janine Heinrichs on 2023-12-18](https://www.unite.ai/sudowrite-review/)\nThe idea of artificial intelligence writing entire novels may sound like fiction, but Sudowrite offers practical AI tools to help authors through the whole book writing process. With the rising prevalence of AI, you can write an entire novel in a week. But the question is, will it sound human?\n\nIn this Sudowrite review, I will explain what Sudowrite is and who it's best for. From there, I'll show you how to get started on their free plan that grants you 50,000 credits, followed by an in-depth guide on using Sudowrite's primary tools. I share my entire writing process, from brainstorming to writing to editing a mystery novel with Sudowrite that you won't want to miss!\n\nFrom there, I'll share my honest thoughts on what I liked and disliked about Sudowrite, followed by the top three Sudowrite alternatives I've tried. My goal with this article is to provide you with the most comprehensive, behind-the-scenes look at how I've used it to write a mystery novel from scratch.\n\nSo, can Sudowrite AI help writers bring their stories to life in a way that feels human? Let's find out!\n\nWhat is Sudowrite?\n\nFounded by Amit Gupta and James Yu, Sudowrite is an AI-powered writing tool designed to assist human writers in their creative process. With its brainstorming features, writing tools that generate captivating novels in days, and editing tools, Sudowrite aims to help writers overcome creative blocks and develop compelling storylines.\n\nSudowrite uses artificial intelligence through its tools to support the creative writing process in any language. Besides its game-changing AI writing tools (which we will get into), Sudowrite ensures the entire experience is comfortable and enjoyable for you as a writer. They do this with font and theme customization, full-screen mode for focus, and chapter organization. They even have a Google Chrome extension for using Sudowrite in Google Docs!\n\nSudowrite AI avoids plagiarism by harnessing the power of ChatGPT-3 and 4, along with Transformer models containing an impressive 175 billion parameters. These models have been trained to grasp various general concepts from their extensive training data.\n\nWhether you're an author, fiction writer, or blogger, Sudowrite offers practical uses of AI to enhance your writing process. Let's look at who benefits the most from using it!\n\nWho Should Use Sudowrite?\n\nAnyone interested in creative writing should use Sudowrite, even just for fun. Trust me, it's worth it. However, there are a few types of people Sudowrite AI is most suitable:\n\nFiction Writers: Sudowrite is most suited for writers struggling with writer's block as it offers all the tools you need to write a novel or short story. Use the Brainstorm tool to generate ideas to build worlds and characters and develop an outline using AI with Canvas. Add that outline to the Story Bible to get AI to write your entire novel one chapter at a time.\n\nStudents: Sudowrite is an invaluable resource for students, especially those studying literature or creative writing. Whether you need help writing essays, analyzing literature, or crafting compelling stories for assignments, Sudowrite's AI writing assistant can be your go-to tool. It provides guidance and suggestions and even helps you refine your writing style.\n\nBloggers: For bloggers looking to create engaging content, use Sudowrite to generate fresh ideas, craft compelling headlines, and structure your blog posts. From there, use the AI-powered writing assistant to refine your writing to make it more engaging and overcome writer's block.\n\nMarketers: Marketers can use Sudowrite to generate persuasive marketing copy that stands out. The AI-powered writing assistant can help you create compelling sales pages, email campaigns, and social media posts. Plus, it generates attention-grabbing headlines and enables you to develop effective calls to action to capture leads and make sales.\n\nCopywriters: Copywriters can use Sudowrite AI to enhance their writing for product descriptions, website content, and promotional materials. Use Sudowrite to generate creative ideas for advertising campaigns with the Brainstorm tool. Use sensory language with the Describe tool to make your copy more captivating for your target audience.\n\nPoets/Songwriters: Sudowrite can help poets and songwriters explore new ideas with the Brainstorm, refine their lyrical expression with Rewrite and Describe, and ultimately overcome any creative blocks they may encounter. It has a dedicated ‚ÄúPoem‚Äù tool that generates a contemporary free verse poem in seconds!\n\nGetting Started with Sudowrite\n\nI started by going to the Sudowrite homepage, scrolling down, and selecting ‚ÄúTry Sudowrite for Free‚Äù in the bottom right corner.\n\nSudowrite is free forever (no credit card required) with a generous starting balance of 50,000 credits. Once those credits are consumed, plans start at $10 per month, making Sudowrite affordable for writers of all levels.\n\nOnce I signed up, Sudowrite gave me a quick demo of how to write and describe using AI. I found the demo helpful, giving me more confidence in using Sudowrite as my AI writer.\n\nAfter the demo, I was taken to an untitled Sudowrite project where I could start writing. The user interface was clean and intuitive, making navigating the various features and tools Sudowrite offers easy.\n\nLet's get into a brief explanation of the Sudowrite tools and how to use them.\n\nSudowrite Tools\n\nSudowrite offers a range of tools that writers can use to enhance their writing process, which can be divided into three categories:\n\nBrainstorming Tools\n\nWriting Tools\n\nEditing Tools\n\nWe'll explore the main tools that come with Sudowrite, and I will show you how I used these tools to begin writing a novel!\n\n1. Brainstorming Tools\n\nWhether you're writing fiction, blog posts, or any other creative content, these brainstorming tools provide practical help, enabling you to generate unique and captivating storylines:\n\nBrainstorm: ‚ÄúBrainstorm‚Äù is a giant list builder that generates the perfect name or title. It's like having a reliable and endless source of ideas. Give a thumbs up to your favorite ideas, which will provide you with even better ones.\n\nCanvas: ‚ÄúCanvas‚Äù allows you to create an outline containing a summary of your story, character secrets, and plot twists. It's a convenient space to store all your inspiration and references in one location.\n\nVisualize: ‚ÄúVisualize‚Äù enhances your character sheets and world-building documents by turning your descriptions into captivating artwork.\n\nHow I Used Sudowrite's Brainstorm Tools\n\nHere's how I used Sudowrite's brainstorming tools to get ideas for a story to write using Sudowrite.\n\nBrainstorm\n\nIn my Sudowrite project, I selected ‚ÄúBrainstorm‚Äù at the top.\n\nI was asked what I wanted to brainstorm, ranging from dialogues, names, characters, places, and more! I selected ‚ÄúSomething Else‚Äù to generate my novel title.\n\nFor Sudowrite to give me a list of potential titles for my novel, I had to tell it what to provide me with (in my case, ‚ÄúNovel titles.‚Äù)\n\nOptionally, I could give Sudowrite some context and title examples. I didn't have any examples, so I left that blank. However, I did have some context of the novel I was planning on writing, so I placed that in the ‚ÄúContext‚Äù field.\n\nFrom there, I hit ‚ÄúStart‚Äù to see what novel title ideas Sudowrite would generate.\n\nInstantly, Sudowrite gave me a list of engaging novel titles! All of the ideas were good, but there was one that I particularly liked: ‚ÄúThree Minutes Ahead: A Detective LaBlanche Mystery.‚Äù\n\nI gave it a thumbs up to add it to my ‚ÄúKeepers‚Äù list, and that title was immediately replaced with another excellent title. If I didn't like the title, I could give it a thumbs down to be instantly replaced with a new title.\n\nWhether I selected the thumbs up or down, each idea was replaced with a new one. The Sudowrite brainstorm feature is a never-ending source of creative inspiration!\n\nAfter saving my list and exiting, I returned to my Sudowrite project. Sudowrite AI added my Brainstorm list to the History panel on the right, where I could easily insert, copy, open, or favorite it anytime!\n\nSudowrite's brainstorming tool is invaluable for any writer looking to generate fresh ideas like dialogues, names, characters, places, or plot points. With a few clicks, you can unlock a wealth of creativity to fuel your storytelling!\n\nCanvas\n\nWithin my Sudowrite project, I selected ‚ÄúCanvas‚Äù on the bottom left.\n\nI was greeted with a large canvas with character cards, images, and an outline! Sudowrite did an excellent job clearly explaining how to use the canvas, which can initially feel overwhelming.\n\nI could start from scratch with blank cards, labels, and outlines by adding them to the bottom of the canvas. Alternatively, I could build characters and a storyline with what was already filled out. I went with the latter.\n\nI started by hovering my mouse over the character cards and selecting the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon to get Sudowrite to generate more character descriptions for me.\n\nSudowrite did an excellent job! This is a great way to add more depth to my characters.\n\nVisualize\n\nI could also select ‚ÄúVisualize‚Äù to get Sudowrite to generate an image of the character in seconds based on the description.\n\nThe image looks excellent and fits the description perfectly! This feature brought my characters to life and helped me visualize them in my story.\n\nOn the right was the entire outline for my story. I selected ‚ÄúGenerate full outline,‚Äù and the whole thing was populated a few seconds later. It was like having a personal writing assistant right at my fingertips.\n\nNext, I selected one of the cards in my outline and clicked ‚ÄúGenerate options for this card‚Äù to see variations of this part of the story.\n\nSudowrite always generates three variations at a time. Here's one of them:\n\nSudowrite did a fantastic job developing options for this card. The text appears as though it was written by a person, offering me a new viewpoint on how the scene could unfold and enhancing the depth of my overall storyline.\n\nThe Sudowrite canvas is a powerful tool for writers, especially those who may feel overwhelmed by starting from scratch. From generating character descriptions and visuals to creating an entire outline in seconds, Sudowrite is the perfect tool to enhance your storytelling.\n\n2. Writing Tools\n\nUse these writing tools to overcome writer‚Äôs block, refine your writing style, and write engaging content:\n\nWrite: ‚ÄúWrite‚Äù analyzes the traits of your characters, the tone of your writing, and the progression of your plot. From there, it generates 300 words in your unique tone of voice. It also gives you different variations to choose from!\n\nDescribe: Sudowrite's ‚ÄúDescribe‚Äù tool lets you highlight and describe specific things in your story to facilitate a strong connection between your readers and your characters. This helps your readers feel fully immersed in the story.\n\nExpand: ‚ÄúExpand‚Äù enhances the pacing of your story so it isn't too fast, maintaining an ideal pace that prevents readers from being disconnected.\n\nStory Bible (Story Engine): The ‚ÄúStory Bible‚Äù feature guides you through each stage of the fiction writing process, from your initial idea to creating an outline, developing chapters, and ultimately generating thousands of words in your unique writing style. You can write an entire novel within a week!\n\nHow I Used Sudowrite to Start Writing a Novel\n\nHere's how I used Sudowrite to begin writing my novel.\n\nWrite\n\nTo begin writing my novel with Sudowrite, I had to write at least 20 words (Sudowrite needs some context to work its magic). After doing so, I placed my cursor at the end of it and clicked on the ‚ÄúWrite‚Äù button, and Sudowrite sprung into action.\n\nIt's important to note that the dropdown arrow next to the ‚ÄúWrite‚Äù button offers different writing modes: Auto, Guided (give Sudowrite instructions), and Tone Shift (change your writing style). I could also access my writing settings. In my case, I stuck with the default Auto write but feel free to experiment!\n\nInstantly, Sudowrite continued the story by populating the right panel with some options to continue the story. I skimmed through them and inserted the one I liked most by selecting the ‚ÄúInsert‚Äù button. Once inserted, the text turned purple, indicating that Sudowrite had written it and needed editing.\n\nI was thoroughly impressed with what Sudowrite had come up with. The options Sudowrite gave me were well-crafted and perfectly aligned with the tone and style I had in mind for my novel.\n\nThe text also hooks the reader instantly, intriguing them to delve deeper into the story. Sudowrite's ability to capture the essence of my characters and maintain the progression of the plot was remarkable!\n\nDescribe\n\nAfter making a few tweaks (Sudowrite had gotten the pronouns of my detective protagonist wrong), I wanted to explore the ‚ÄúDescribe‚Äù feature. In my case, the silhouette is something of interest to the reader. I highlighted this word within the document and hit ‚ÄúDescribe.‚Äù\n\nSudowrite generated descriptions of the Silhouette in the right panel using different senses and metaphors. The options were vivid and imaginative, painting a detailed picture of the silhouette! In my case, the description based on ‚ÄúSight‚Äù made the most sense, so that's the one I inserted into the document.\n\nExpand\n\nAnother tool I loved in Sudowrite is the ‚ÄúExpand‚Äù tool, where I could highlight one or multiple sentences and continue the story at an ideal pace. I highlighted the two sentences I had just inserted describing the silhouette and selected ‚ÄúExpand.‚Äù\n\nHere is how Sudowrite continued my story after expanding it:\n\nI'm genuinely impressed with the quality of writing. Sudowrite did an excellent job continuing my story and establishing a high level of engagement with optimal pacing!\n\nStory Bible\n\nLast but not least is the Story Bible. This is perfect for people who don't want to start with a blank document, as it will write a first draft of every chapter for you! Crazy, right?\n\nI accessed Story Bible by turning on the ‚ÄúStory Bible‚Äù toggle in the bottom left of my document.\n\nFrom there, I began filling out the fields:\n\nBraindump: Write anything and everything you know about your story.\n\nGenre: Identify the genres you are writing in.\n\nStyle: Describe how the story will be written (I highly recommend using ‚ÄúMatch my style‚Ä¶‚Äù to paste up to 2,000 words of your writing and have Sudowrite describe it).\n\nSynopsis: Present the characters, their goals, and the primary source of conflict while effectively capturing the tone, themes, and distinctive aspects of the story (select ‚ÄúGenerate Synopsis‚Äù to get Sudowrite to fill this out for you).\n\nCharacters: Describe everything there is to know about the characters, including physical appearance, mannerisms, relationships, and goals (I highly recommend selecting ‚ÄúGenerate Characters‚Äù to get Sudowrite to generate this for you).\n\nOutline: Write your outline or choose from one of five outlines provided by Sudowrite.\n\nI was thoroughly impressed with how accurately Sudowrite matched my style, generated a synopsis, and more. It made the entire process of writing my story so much easier and enjoyable.\n\nOnce complete, Sudowrite began adding chapters to my document that I could start generating by following the steps. I selected ‚ÄúGenerate Beats‚Äù (‚Äúbeats‚Äù being the main elements of the chapter), and Sudowrite did an excellent job of giving an overview of the chapter.\n\nThe second step was generating the chapter. I liked that I could choose the speed, accuracy, and more by selecting the down arrow next to the ‚ÄúGenerate Chapter‚Äù button. This helped me tailor the output to my preferences by giving me the choice of prioritizing speed, accuracy, etc.\n\nSudowrite began writing out the story beats; I could walk away and let Sudowrite write my entire novel. It took a couple of minutes to generate (mind you, this is a whole book chapter!), but the quality of writing was worth the wait. From there, I moved on to the next chapter.\n\nEach beat was concise yet captivating, providing a clear roadmap for the chapter's progression. Sudowrite effortlessly captured the tone and themes of my story, infusing it with the same style and voice that I had established.\n\nSudowrite's Story Bible feature is an absolute game-changer for authors with writer's block who want to pump out an entire novel in a week. Within minutes, I could generate whole chapters of a book; all I had to do was edit it. It truly works like magic!\n\nMake sure you take advantage of the Story Bible resources:\n\nStory Bible Guide\n\nSudowrite Classes\n\n3. Editing Tools\n\nSudowrite‚Äôs revision tools offer practical help in revision, better word choice, and story enhancement:\n\nRewrite: Get ‚ÄúRewrite‚Äù to revise your writing without doing it 100 times manually. It's incredibly adaptable, unfailingly persistent, and always open to feedback.\n\nThesaurus: Sudowrite includes an integrated ‚ÄúThesaurus‚Äù where you can highlight a word and instantly generate alternative words with similar meanings.\n\nHow I Used Sudowrite to Edit a Novel\n\nHere's how I used Sudowrite to edit my novel.\n\nRewrite\n\nIf I needed to make some revisions, Sudowrite's Rewrite tool was invaluable. It allowed me to revise my writing quickly without countless manual edits. To use it, I only highlighted the sentence or sentences I wanted to rewrite and hit the ‚ÄúRewrite‚Äù button.\n\nIn the right panel, I could choose how I wanted Sudowrite to rewrite my sentences, whether rephrasing them or making them shorter, more descriptive, adding inner conflict, and more. I could even give it a custom request with the ‚ÄúCustomize‚Äù option! I went with ‚ÄúRephrase‚Äù and hit ‚ÄúGo.‚Äù\n\nSudowrite generated two variations of the original sentence. The sentence was excellently rewritten, maintaining the meaning and providing a new perspective with more description.\n\nThesaurus\n\nSudowrite's ‚ÄúThesaurus‚Äù tool (it doesn't seem to have a name; I'm just calling it that) gave me different synonyms to replace words that I felt would be better. I highlighted ‚Äúbillowed‚Äù in my document, and Sudowrite suggested a few synonyms.\n\nSelecting the ‚Äúmore‚Ä¶‚Äù option took me to a ‚Äúword cloud‚Äù page where I could select the word I wanted to use. I chose ‚Äúfluttered‚Äù and could generate more like that word or copy it to insert it into my text.\n\nAnd there you have it! My entire process of writing a novel using Sudowrite's primary brainstorming, writing, and editing tools.\n\nI was amazed by the caliber of writing Sudowrite generates and how efficient the process was, particularly with the help of Story Bible. I'm convinced anyone at any skill level can produce an entire novel within a week!\n\nWhat I Liked About Sudowrite\n\nUp to 50,000 credits on the permanently free version of Sudowrite, suitable for writers on any budget.\n\nThe interface is easy to navigate, and the tools are fun.\n\nSudowrite generates excellent results that sound human, making it a valuable tool for beginner writers.\n\nSave significant time using AI to streamline your creative process (Story Bible can write an entire novel within a week!)\n\nTools for each stage of the creative writing process, from brainstorming to writing to editing.\n\nUse AI to turn descriptions into artwork instantly for better visualization.\n\nThe content is written accurately in your unique tone of voice.\n\nKeep readers engaged by using AI to describe things in your story more deeply and expand text for optimal pacing.\n\nGet Sudowrite to rewrite up to six variations simultaneously rather than doing this manually.\n\nHighlight individual words and select better synonyms Sudowrite suggests.\n\nChapters are organized neatly within projects.\n\nWrites in almost any language; does not plagiarize.\n\nSudowrite Google Chrome Extension for those who want to use Sudowrite in Google Docs.\n\nSudowrite Discord community if you have questions or want to connect with like-minded AI writers.\n\nSudowrite Manual on how to use Sudowrite.\n\nWhat I Disliked About Sudowrite\n\nSudowrite may get aspects of the story wrong, such as pronouns or characters.\n\nA lot of features may feel overwhelming for some users.\n\nThe canvas feature was useful but felt clunky.\n\nTop 3 Sudowrite Alternatives I've Tried\n\nIn this section, I will compare Sudowrite to other AI story generators I've used to help you decide which tool best suits your writing needs.\n\nJasper AI\n\nJasper AI is among the best AI writing assistants on the market. Give it a text prompt, and it will generate creative and engaging content in your unique tone of voice. You can write an entire story or a 1,500-word article in seconds!\n\nOne of the most significant differences between the platforms is the target demographics. Jasper AI is designed more for marketing teams and businesses to maintain a consistent brand voice while collaborating on generating compelling content across multiple channels. There's a feature for creating brand voices and campaigns, which Sudowrite does not have.\n\nMeanwhile, Sudowrite is more geared towards creative writers who want to rekindle their passion for writing and overcome writer's block. Tools like the Canvas for describing characters and creating outlines and the Story Bible that generates an entire novel chapter by chapter make it clear that Sudowrite focuses on providing a creative writing experience.\n\nWhile both tools benefit marketers and creative writers, choose Jasper for more robust marketing and business tools for your team to collaborate. If you are a creative writer, like an author or poet, choose Sudowrite.\n\nWe also Compare Jasper Vs. Copy AI & Jasper Vs. Scalenut.\n\nRead our Jasper Review or visit Jasper.\n\nWritesonic\n\nWritesonic is another powerful writing tool that uses AI technology to create high-quality content. With Writesonic, you can generate blog posts, social media captions, and generate entire stories with just a few clicks.\n\nWhat sets Writesonic apart from Sudowrite is its ability to cater to a wide range of writing needs. Whether you're a content marketer looking for catchy headlines or a startup founder needing persuasive copy for your landing page, Writesonic has what you need.\n\nThe platform offers various templates and prompts to get your creative juices flowing. You can give specific details about your topic or let Writesonic develop creative ideas for you. It is incredibly user-friendly and intuitive, making it accessible to writers of all skill levels.\n\nOne notable feature of Writesonic is its ability to generate entire stories. Whether you're in need of a short fiction piece or a longer narrative, Writesonic can provide you with a well-crafted story that captures the essence of your chosen genre.\n\nAlthough Writesonic can write stories from start to finish, it also offers tools and templates for other types of writers. Choose Writesonic if you plan on using it as a writing tool for a variety of purposes that go beyond story writing. For fictional writers who want more robust brainstorming, writing, and editing tools for their novels, choose Sudowrite!\n\nRead our Writesonic Review or visit Writesonic.\n\nPlot Factory\n\nPlot Factory is another AI-powered writing platform that allows you to collaboratively plan, organize, and write stories. Unlike Sudowrite and Jasper AI, Plot Factory focuses specifically on helping writers develop and organize their story plots. However, it still generates stories with AI.\n\nWith Plot Factory, you can create different ‚Äúuniverses‚Äù that house stories, characters, places, objects, and more. It provides a comprehensive toolkit for structuring your story, planning scenes, and tracking the progression of your characters.\n\nWhile Sudowrite and Jasper AI provide more versatile writing assistance across various genres and styles, Plot Factory excels in organizing and planning out stories. If you're a writer who struggles with plot development or want to improve your storytelling structure and character development, Plot Factory is the perfect tool for you!\n\nSudowrite Review: Can AI Write Novels That Sound Human?\n\nAfter using Sudowrite's tools to write a novel from start to finish, Sudowrite is more than capable of writing compelling content that sounds human. Although it can't replace actual writing, I would argue that it's still better than what humans can write.\n\nFrom the start, Sudowrite matched my tone of voice and pacing while infusing words I would have never thought of to captivate readers. The AI-powered platform effortlessly weaved together intricate plotlines, compelling characters, and immersive settings. It was like having a co-author who understood and brought my creative vision to life.\n\nBesides the brainstorming tools that helped me develop unique titles, characters, and plotlines, Sudowrite wrote my entire novel without me lifting a finger. All I had to do was indicate what the story was about and the genre. I walked away from my computer, knowing Sudowrite would continue crafting my story with the same creativity and attention to detail. After that, I used Sudowrite's AI editing tools to make the final touches.\n\nI hope you found my review of Sudowrite helpful! Whether you're a beginner writer or a seasoned author, I'm confident Sudowrite will revolutionize your writing process. With its AI-powered tools and seamless integration into your creative vision, Sudowrite offers an experience like no other. Sudowrite surpassed my expectations, and I'm sure it will for you, too.\n\nSudowrite has many good things going for it in the foreseeable future you won't want to miss. Try Sudowrite for free and get 50,000 credits to start writing the next bestseller.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs Sudowrite worth the money?\n\nYes, Sudowrite is well worth the money. After signing up, you'll be granted 50,000 credits and full access to brainstorming, writing, and editing tools to start writing compelling content. For most authors, that word count is quite limited. Once those 50,000 credits have been consumed, plans start at $10 per month.

It uses advanced AI technology to generate human-like writing but does not collect or store personal information. I also did not encounter any problems related to data breaches or security vulnerabilities on my device, further confirming Sudowrite's safety.\n\nHow much is Sudowrite per month?\n\nSudowrite's free trial is free forever; no credit card is required.

      "# [AI is Not the Writer‚Äôs Enemy by Harley Austin, medium.harleyaustin.com on 2024-02-24](https://medium.harleyaustin.com/ai-is-not-the-writers-enemy-45b03145737b)\nAI is Not Really the Enemy‚ÄîScammers Are\n\nLast year I wrote an article about an AI tool that really impressed me with its ability to proofread my chapters. Note that I did not say it ‚Äúwrote‚Äù my chapters. Most of us as real authors despise those kinds of tools.\n\nUnfortunately, these ‚Äúwrite it for you‚Äù tools are popping up everywhere now. Not a day goes by that I don‚Äôt see some social media ad for a new AI tool that promises to make me a bestselling author by writing my book FOR me.\n\nAmazon is now flooded with millions of junk books written by AI and published by people who cannot write, but who bought into some scammer‚Äôs $37 ‚Äúsystem‚Äù for getting rich on Amazon by using AI to write a worthless book no one would want to actually buy.\n\nNeedless to say, AI has left a really bad taste in the mouths of real authors and writers who spend years of our lives honing our craft, only to be overshadowed in the marketplace by people who cannot write their way out of a wet paper bag.\n\nBut this is the new world we live in as AI emerges front and center into our strange and ever-changing new world.\n\nThe AI Tools Worth Writing About\n\nThat being said, AI is not really our enemy; scammers promising quick riches to gullible people are, but that‚Äôs an article for another time.\n\nThe AI proofreading tool I wrote about last year worked well, but it was rather rudimentary in how it worked. Mostly it was because I couldn‚Äôt actually see the changes the tool made to my text it had corrected. Also, there was no way to preserve formatting, curly quotes, etc. It was a very basic tool.\n\nFast-forward a few months and I have discovered a bevy of new AI writing tools thanks to social media. I am going to briefly review a few of them here, but mostly I‚Äôm going to focus on the one that is really the easiest of the four to use.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the cost?\n\nMost of these tools all cost about the same, about $10 to $20 per month, and all of them charge you in some fashion by the number of words you process. There are some that don‚Äôt charge by usage, but they are much more pricey per month to use‚Äîor the tool itself is a scam.\n\nScammers sell you a one-time or ‚Äúlifetime‚Äù subscription for $59 to $149 or whatever, which is an unsustainable business model for any usage-based business. At some point, when the expenses exceed their Ponzi-scheme revenues, the company and your money will disappear forever.\n\nIf you see a writing tool promising a ‚Äúlifetime‚Äù or one-time purchase option, run. It‚Äôs a scam.\n\nAll these tools are using one or more versions of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT AI engine under the hood. What makes them better than just trying to use your own OpenAI account directly are their writing and editing features that OpenAI doesn‚Äôt offer.\n\nAlso, one of the benefits of using OpenAI under the hood is that they don‚Äôt use (ie. plagiarize) our work to train their models. As of March of 2023, OpenAI announced that they will NOT be training their models using user-entered content. This is GREAT news for us as authors and writers!\n\nSo let‚Äôs take a look at these tools, in reverse order of my pet personal preference. You can then decide which of these might work best for you.\n\n3. AutoCrit\n\nWhile AutoCrit has been around for a few years, I‚Äôve only been seeing their ads since last year. Like Sudowrite, AutoCrit‚Äôs ‚Äúcreative studio‚Äù feature can do a deep-dive into helping you prompt the AI with all kinds of terms as it literally rewrites your chapters for you.\n\nBut AutoCrit is much more than just AI. It‚Äôs an entire writing platform.\n\nWhat turned me off about AutoCrit was that it attempts to take over my entire writing process with its own ‚Äúprocess‚Äù. Huh? Look, I just want to write my book, not insert myself into some massive framework that leads me by the nose into taking over every step of my writing and publishing. Does it blow my nose too?\n\nAutoCrit is a ‚Äúplotter‚Äôs‚Äù dream come true, and a ‚Äúpantser‚Äôs‚Äù worst nightmare.\n\nWhile AutoCrit is a well-polished product, it does WAY too much. And all that hand-holding comes with a price tag. AutoCrit is by far the most expensive of all these tools. But if you need this level of hand-holding, encouragement, feedback, and nose-wiping to write a novel, then maybe this tool is for you. I‚Äôm much too type-A, much too free-spirited, to be using a nit-picky style-rating tool like this. Get out of my way, I just want to write.\n\n1. PowerWord AI\n\nThe tool I liked the best was PowerWord. Written by authors for authors, PowerWord is by far the more easy-to-use and polished of these tools and the one that least got in my way during proofreading and editing.\n\nWhat I liked best was how PowerWord shows you your original text in one window while letting you compare what the AI changed in a companion window. You can then scroll through the linked windows and see the changes that the AI made, then edit the results. Boom! Done.\n\nI also liked how PowerWord let me select between light and dark screen modes, and between serif and san-serif font faces in the edit windows. Those are subtle but nice touches.\n\nWhile all of these tools basically charge by the number of words you process, because that‚Äôs how OpenAI bills for their service, PowerWord was by far the least expensive to get started. You can start with as little as $5 to buy words on a pay-as-you-go basis, or you can sign up for a subscription starting at just $5 per month for double the number of words. PowerWord also doesn‚Äôt scam you into a lower monthly rate by making you pay annually either. That was refreshing to see.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was that PowerWord seemed to understand how I want to work. You can tell these people are actual authors themselves because the tool gets out of your way and just lets you work like a real writer would. For me, I just want to paste my chapter into the tool, click proofread, see what got changed, then copy the corrected text back into Word and move on. That‚Äôs exactly how PowerWord lets me work. It gets the job done quickly and efficiently without a bunch of bells and whistles and other editor noise getting in the way.\n\nMost impressively, PowerWord didn‚Äôt change my text formatting. Curly quotes, italics, bold, all of it was still there. PowerWord was also able to correct emphasis on words that needed emphasis where before I hadn‚Äôt used it. Wow.\n\nLike the other tools, PowerWord lets me proofread, analyze, summarize, and even rewrite paragraphs using different genres, if I need. It would be a great tool for editors too. In fact, anyone who writes would benefit from using this tool.\n\nAnother thing PowerWord did was get out of my way so that I could just use ChatGPT conversationally. No need to pull up another window. Just click the Chat link and I was off and running asking for some info on the topic I was writing about.\n\nPowerWord was also the only tool I saw that offered translating. You can translate an entire novel into multiple languages. And the translation is quite good. Of course, it‚Äôs not going to be as good as a native writer in whatever language, but several of my Spanish-speaking friends were impressed with how well the tool translated English to Spanish. It does a good job of translating dialects too. When translating American English into British, I noticed native idioms I‚Äôve never even seen before.\n\nThe Limitations of AI\n\nNow for the caveats‚Äîif you‚Äôre a romance author, expect to see these tools tone-down your steamy love scenes. Most of the AI engines out there eschew NSFW (not safe for work) prose. If you‚Äôre editing a steamy-hot love scene using any of these tools, you will need to do a bit more manual editing, as the AI returns a kind of Biblical purple prose you probably won‚Äôt appreciate, or it lets you know you just violated its terms of service.\n\nAnother gotcha was the AI ‚Äútemperature‚Äù or what PowerWord calls the ‚Äúcreative‚Äù level you want the AI to use. I got the best results when keeping the creative temperature on its next to lowest settings. Otherwise you get prose that reads like the AI is on LSD.\n\nFinally, just keep in mind that while these tools are really good, they are not perfect. You still need to manually edit some of what the AI generates. The AI often got wordy on rewrites, attempting to create new parts of the story I didn‚Äôt need it adding.\n\nNone of them were perfect, but they will save you time, a lot of time, editing and proofreading with a high level of accuracy you just won't get trying to do it yourself.",
      "# [5 AI creative writing tools by David Burton on 2024-08-16](https://www.artshub.co.uk/news/features/5-ai-creative-writing-tools-2617465/)\nIf you‚Äôre ready to embrace the technological future, there‚Äôs a diverse range of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for creative writers available. While it‚Äôs feasible that AI could write your masterpiece for you, it probably won‚Äôt become the next literary award-winner. Overall, AI tools are best used as a means of generating ideas or first drafts, or correcting prose. Embraced in this way, AI can streamline your creative writing process.\n\nWhen considering these tools, it‚Äôs essential to know if the work you generate on the platforms will be used to train further AI models or possibly used in ways you didn‚Äôt intend. For more on the ethics of creative AI, take a look at the Senate inquiry into AI in Australia, and what concerns by the sector were tabled.\n\nGrammarly\n\nOne of the world‚Äôs most popular grammar checkers, Grammarly recently rebranded itself as AI writing assistance. Apart from offering a robust service for basic punctuation and grammar mistakes, Grammarly can use AI to check the tone of your writing and make suggestions. Ideal for professional emails and documents, Grammarly is also rare in its meaningful integration with Office 365 and most internet browsers.\n\nSudowrite\n\nIf nothing else, Sudowrite is a fun toy to play with. Sudowrite is designed for fiction writers. It‚Äôs in-browser app has a range of tools, including brainstorming names or locations. But its real thrill is in its Story Bible tool. It will take your unrefined brain dump and turn it into a synopsis, an outline, a chapter and a character breakdown. From there, it can generate a beat-by-beat summary for each chapter and even write it for you.\n\nYou can provide edits and nudges in the desired direction at each step. Sudowrite feels the most like the creative writing techno-dystopia that keeps editors and authors up at night. Still, when handled properly, it is most like a helpful, occasionally dim-witted co-writer. Sudowrite‚Äôs pricing is aggressive: a monthly subscription will net you a dedicated amount of AI hints, but you will need to pay extra if you run out. Writing an entire chapter, for example, is an expensive enterprise.\n\nJasper\n\nTaking the lead in blog writing, marketing copy and social media posts, Jasper is constructed to help an organisation with content marketing. It leverages your company‚Äôs established brand voice and style guide to begin generating content. It can build a content strategy for you, or work off one you have already created. You can use the Jasper app in-browser, but you can also use the Jasper API directly into code. Many other SEO (search engine optimisation) and content generation AI creative writing tools offer slight variants. Jasper remains one of the most popular.\n\nProWritingAid\n\nGeared towards journalists, academics and authors, ProWritingAid offers unique insight on your early drafts. It is not designed for content generation, but will offer a customised critique of your work, describing strengths, weaknesses and areas for improvement. Fiction writers can receive custom suggestions on plot enhancement, characters, setting and pace. It will also shorten or expand sections while maintaining your authorial voice. Among the spectrum of AI creative writing tools, it is also relatively inexpensive.\n\nRytr",

Not only is it lonely hard work, but there‚Äôs no way to tell if your readers will appreciate your efforts.\n\nAll the while, you face (and sometimes lose) countless battles with writer‚Äôs block and the feelings of inadequacy that come with it.\n\nIf only you had a writing partner to share the burden, perhaps it would be easier!\n\nLucky for you, there are several AI story-writing assistants that can accompany you on your creative journey!\n\nOne of them is Sudowrite, and in this Sudowrite review, we reveal its features, pros, cons, alternatives, and our verdict on whether it‚Äôs worth the investment.\n\nWhat is Sudowrite?\n\nSudowrite is an AI novel writing assistant that makes the creative writing process more fun and interactive. It has many fantastic features, such as helping brainstorm ideas for characters and plot points, rewriting sections of your story in a different tone, and giving great vocabulary suggestions!\n\nThe AI program also acts as a beta reader for your stories, giving you constructive feedback and new ideas to try.\n\nUnlike other AI writing tools, it‚Äôs more helpful in writing fiction, though you can also use it to write non-fiction.\n\nAccording to one of its founders, you can think of this AI creative writing tool as a ‚Äúsparring partner who helps you edit your book, create new scenes, and generate plot ideas.‚Äù\n\nWhen you get stuck on a sentence or can‚Äôt find the words to describe a story element, you can rely on Sudowrite to move your story forward.\n\nAs with other AI tools and technologies like chatbots, Speech-to-Text, and assistants like Siri, Sudowrite relies on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to produce its output.\n\nThe implication of using NLP and machine learning is that this AI tool can develop a level of understanding of your story. So, it offers suggestions you can use in your own writing based on what it understands, as though it were your co-writer.\n\nYou can use Sudowrite as a brainstorming tool when writing novels, to produce a rough first draft, to develop story elements and character arcs, for world-building, and so on.\n\nIt can even help you with creative writing that isn‚Äôt your strong point (particularly poetry) and offer an opinion on your writing like it was a friend you gave your story to read.\n\nTop Benefits of Sudowrite\n\nHow can Sudowrite help you? Below, we list some of the main benefits of using this AI story generator software to write stories.\n\nOvercome Writer‚Äôs Block: When you get stuck on ideas, you can turn to Sudowrite for ideas on how to progress your story.\n\nCompliment Your Writing Style: Sudowrite develops an understanding of your story as it progresses and will proffer suggestions that fit right in with your own work.\n\nGet AI-Provided Feedback: One of Sudowrite‚Äôs best features is that it provides feedback on your writing and suggests ways to improve it.\n\nHelps with Character Creation: You can use it to create characters for your story and establish the relationships between them (more below).\n\nProvides Succinct Summaries: Sudowrite is adept at summarizing chunks of prose.\n\nFinds the Words: If you can‚Äôt find the words to describe an object, Sudowrite has a tool to help with that.\n\nUnleashes Your Inner Poet: Don‚Äôt know how to craft poems? No problem! Sudowrite has a feature for that.\n\nIn the next section, we‚Äôll discuss the features that provide the benefits mentioned above in more detail.\n\nBest Features of Sudowrite\n\nSudowrite has many features and story tools that make writing prose with it a joy.\n\nIt has a Write feature that is fantastic for breaking past writer‚Äôs block, a Describe button that acts like a Thesaurus but for sentences; a Brainstorming tool that‚Äôs excellent for ideation, a Character generator that helps with characterization; and so much more.\n\nLet‚Äôs discuss some of the essential ones in this section.\n\nFirst Draft\n\nThe First Draft feature will take your story idea input and generate up to 1000 words ‚Äì giving you a great first draft of your idea.\n\nExpand Feature\n\nThe Expand feature used to be called the Wormhole (due to the creators‚Äô love for sci-fi). Think of it as autocomplete for writers.\n\nWhen you use this feature, Sudowrite looks at the text in your document and provides suggestions for subsequent paragraphs. Some of the tips fit so seamlessly into your prose that your readers won‚Äôt be able to tell where your sentence ends and the AI‚Äôs begins.\n\nOf course, this feature isn‚Äôt perfect. Sometimes, it may take your story in a completely different direction than you intended. However, with trial and error, you can get Sudowrite to do your bidding.\n\nRewrite Tool\n\nThe Rewrite tool is excellent for improving aspects of your story. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre writing a horror novel and want to give a scene a more ominous tone.\n\nWhen you describe the tone you want to write, Sudowrite will rewrite the passage and include foreboding vocabulary that‚Äôll fit the tone you‚Äôve described.\n\nThis tool compliments the Describe button. Also, it helps give your novel‚Äôs characters their own individual voice. And if you find yourself breaking the ‚Äúshow, don‚Äôt tell‚Äù rule often, you‚Äôll be relying on this feature a lot.\n\nDescribe Feature\n\nThe ‚ÄúDescribe‚Äù button has helped many writers when they‚Äôre at a loss for words. For example, if you can‚Äôt find the words to describe a boat, Sudowriter will give you some suggestions with sensory detail when you press the Describe button.\n\nAlso, Sudowriter offers metaphorical descriptions.\n\nTo use this feature, highlight a word and hit the Describe button. Sudowrite will provide paragraph-level suggestions (not just single words!) based on the five senses (sight, taste, touch, smell, and sound).\n\nBrainstorming Feature\n\nHave you ever wanted to create plot points but worried that you were writing yourself into a corner? The brainstorming feature will help you through such complex story problems. To use it, you need to supply Sudowrite with the problem you‚Äôre trying to create.\n\nFor example, if your story‚Äôs protagonist gets captured and you‚Äôre trying to figure out how they‚Äôll escape, you can give Sudowrite the scene‚Äôs context using suggestions like ‚Äúthrough a locked window‚Äù or ‚Äúa small crack in the wall.‚Äù Sudowrite will respond by generating possible outcomes, helping you move your story forward.\n\nThen, you can give a thumbs-up to the Sudowrite suggestions you like the most, and it will train the AI to tailor future suggestions to your preferences.\n\nSummarize Feature\n\nThe Summarize feature does what it says: it summarizes chunks of text. For example, you can feed Sudowrite a handful of chapters from your book, and it will give you back an outline for each.\n\nSudowrite‚Äôs developers are currently tweaking the software to make it capable of summarizing an entire book into a one-pager. In the future, literary agents and publishers may be able to use the tool to create summaries for the books in their slush piles.\n\nBetaReader Feature\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to receive feedback on parts of your story but aren‚Äôt ready to show the prose to human readers, Sudowriter can help.\n\nThe software will generate three virtual beta readers that‚Äôll offer helpful criticism on different aspects of a chapter. They can tell you what they liked or didn‚Äôt like about your story.\n\nPlease note that the BetaReader feature is one of Sudowriter‚Äôs experimental features, so your results with this may vary.\n\nCharacter Generator\n\nSudowrite‚Äôs Character Generator is excellent for brainstorming new characters in a story. If you‚Äôve fleshed out the main characters of your story but you‚Äôre coming up short on who they‚Äôll interact with and the dynamics of their relationships, this tool will be your friend.\n\nYou use it by providing Sudowrite with descriptions of your characters, i.e., their age, physical characteristics, job, etc. Sudowrite will take the data and return suggestions for an almost limitless number of characters and the interpersonal relationships between them.\n\nEven if you don‚Äôt find a character you like, you can piece a unique character together by taking parts from each of Sudowrite‚Äôs suggestions.\n\nTwist Feature\n\nSudowrite‚Äôs Twist feature is another incredible thing this software can do. As is suggestive of its name, you can use it to incorporate a plot twist into your story, and it lets you choose the genre of twist you need. So, if twists aren‚Äôt your strong suit, you can rely on this tool.\n\nWhen you give Sudowrite a short story description and use the Twist feature, the AI will use that information to send your plot in an unexpected direction. Like the BetaReader feature, the twist feature is experimental, meaning it won‚Äôt always return a twist that makes sense.\n\nPoetry Tool\n\nSudowrite isn‚Äôt just useful for writing stories. You can also use it to write poetry.\n\nYou can also use its Poetry tool in your stories. For example, you can use this tool to come up with song lyrics sung by a character in your novel. Ditto if your character is a poet and you don‚Äôt have a poetic bone in your body.\n\nStory Bible\n\nSudowrite‚Äôs Story Bible is an easy way for you to add everything about the story idea you have to Sudowrite. They walk you through adding your characters, setting, genre, tone, story outline, and tons of other things so that the AI has the best idea of the story you want to create. It then uses that information to assist you in writing your novel, short story or screenplay! Here‚Äôs how it looks:\n\nWho Should Use Sudowrite?\n\nSudowrite is a tool for creative writers, so novelists, screenwriters, and short story writers will get the most out of it. Published or independent authors who struggle with occasional writer‚Äôs block will also benefit.\n\nAlso, writers with sensory differences (e.g., a writer who is blind or deaf) will appreciate this tool‚Äôs Describe feature, especially how it provides vocabulary and descriptions for how things feel, smell, sound, look, and taste.\n\nIf you write short stories, Sudowrite can help you write your short story in no time at all. Different tools within the software can help accelerate this kind of writing, especially the Brainstorming and Expand features.\n\nAlso, screenwriters may find this software useful, if only for planning out the beats of their scripts. The brainstorming feature is excellent for building on rough ideas, which you can format for the screen.\n\nFinally, literary agents and publishing companies will likely want this tool when the Sudowrite team expands the AI‚Äôs summarizing capabilities. That feature will be fantastic for anyone with many books to read and summarize for publishing and marketing purposes.\n\nSudowrite Plans and Pricing\n\nSudowrite has three plans, and the following costs are if you pay yearly:\n\nHobby and Student Plan ‚Äì costs $19/month (or $10 if you pay yearly) and provides 225,000 credits per month.\n\nProfessional Plan ‚Äì costs $29/month and provides a million credits each month.\n\nMax Plan ‚Äì costs $59/month and provides 2 million credits each month ‚Äì these credits even roll over for up to 12 months so you get the best use out of the program!\n\nThe number of credits you use each month will depend on the AI model you choose to use within Sudowrite. The model you choose will be based on the genre of story you want to write (some of them will write NSFW content, for example, and others won‚Äôt), and the quality of the AI.\n\nIf you need a plan with enterprise-level features, you can contact the team at hi@sudowrite.com.\n\nSudowrite Pros and Cons\n\nSudowrite has a lot going for it. Not only is it affordable, but features like its Rewrite, Describe, and Brainstorming tools and Character Generator make story writing with the software fun.\n\nSudowrite‚Äôs main drawbacks are its lack of a plagiarism checker and some features that are still in the experimental stage. Considering this software is built on the Open AI GPT-3 engine means it is fed information that exists on the internet. Much of that information is subject to copyright so that a plagiarism checker would‚Äôve been reassuring.\n\nLuckily, Sudowrite is just one of many AI writing tools, as the section below shows.\n\nSudowrite Alternatives\n\nIf you‚Äôre wondering what software competes with Sudowrite, here are a couple of alternatives you can use to create works of fiction.\n\nMy Experience Using Sudowrite\n\nCreating a new, free account using an email address was easy. After confirming my email, Sudowrite gave me a tour of the software program:\n\nHere‚Äôs the demo story it wrote for me:\n\nAfter I clicked the ‚Äúwrite‚Äù button, Sudowrite was able to give me two different options for keeping the story going. I clicked to insert the option I liked best, and the software added it to my document.\n\nNext, the software showed me how to use the ‚Äúdescribe‚Äù button to generate written descriptions of items (in this case, the ‚Äújacquard bathrobe.‚Äù\n\nHere are the options it gave me:\n\nThe descriptions it gave were (mostly) fantastic! They went in different creative directions (some were positive, and some had negative connotations) and could absolutely be used in a story.\n\nNext, I asked the software to create a new story for me, one using this prompt:\n\nHere‚Äôs the beginning of the story it wrote:\n\nNext, look below to see the whole story that it created. I copied and pasted it into a Google Doc and turned on the Grammarly grammar-checking extension. You can see that it found quite a few grammar mistakes and that using Grammarly with Sudowrite would help to make the story better.\n\nHonestly, the story was adorable and could be taken and adapted by a human writer into a fantastic short story!\n\nLike with all AI story generators, remember that this is just a tool to assist you with the first step of the story-making process. It‚Äôs still on you to personalize the raw material into a fully-fledged story.\n\nWho Created Sudowrite?\n\nAmit Gupta and James Yu, a pair of developers and science-fiction writers, created Sudowrite in 2020. to help other writers who struggle with writer‚Äôs block.\n\nThe Sudowrite creators count the founders of Medium, WordPress, Twitter, Rotten Tomatoes, and Gumroad among their backers and Hollywood writers and directors of movies like Ocean‚Äôs Twelve and The Bourne Ultimatum.\n\nThe creators of Sudowrite didn‚Äôt develop it to replace the ‚Äúcreative process‚Äù or replace the existing writing community with artificial intelligence. Instead, they created this AI writer to help creative writers fill the gaps in their writing and enhance the knowledge they‚Äôve already acquired when honing their craft.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIf you struggle with writer‚Äôs block, Sudowrite will be a fantastic writing partner to have in your corner. It has many features that help you move your story forward in a fun way.\n\nStandouts include its Describe button, for when you can‚Äôt find the words, its Betareader feature, which provides AI feedback, and its Poetry tool. We can‚Äôt recommend it enough.\n\nAside from authors, creative professionals like publishers and literary agents will have much to look forward to as the Sudowrite team updates the tool.\n\nAnd, its affordable price point makes it an indispensable piece of tech to add to your creative writing arsenal if you harbor aspirations to see your written word in print.\n\nSo, grab your laptop and get creative!"
