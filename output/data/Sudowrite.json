You can write text in almost any language, click Write, and Sudowrite will match your language when it offers suggestions. When using other features, Sudowrite may fall back on English when it isn’t sure. Try it out in our free trial to see how it works for you!\n\nIs this magic? Yes. But so is life, isn’t it?\n\nDo you claim any rights or ownership over what I write in Sudowrite? We claim no rights over anything you put into Sudowrite, nor anything Sudowrite generates for you.\n\nCan Sudowrite plagiarize? The short answer is, Sudowrite won't plagiarize unless you explicitly force it to plagiarize, which is against our terms of service.\n\nThe AI works by guessing one word at a time, based on general concepts it has learned from billions of samples of text. So it's extremely unlikely to produce the same words verbatim, or even ever again. It does not copy and paste chunks of text, it guesses each word (technically, parts of words), one at a time.\n\nThe only way to get Sudowrite to plagiarize is to put in text it’s seen before verbatim, like the lyrics of an popular song, or the first paragraph of an extremely popular book like Harry Potter. As long as your own writing is original, you'll get more original writing out of Sudowrite. We encourage you to try plagiarism checkers to verify your results.\n\nIs this cheating? Sudowrite is a tool for creativity. It's not intended to write for you, but can help you vastly improve and speed up your writing. Just as a great writing partner can help you bust through when you're stuck or be a sounding board to bounce ideas off of, Sudowrite makes writing more fun, faster, and less solitary.\n\nWhat public language models does Sudowrite use? We use over two dozen AI models, including Claude 2 by Anthropic, multiple open models, and several variants of GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, transformer models created by OpenAI. OpenAI trained their models on: (1) a version of the CommonCrawl dataset, filtered based on similarity to high-quality reference corpora, (2) an expanded version of the Webtext dataset, (3) two internet-based book corpora, and (4) English-language Wikipedia. We pair these models with a variety of proprietary narrative model-based and algorithmic pre- and post-processing to enable AI writing features not available anywhere else.\n\nDoes Sudowrite learn and improve from my writing? We are constantly listening to writers' feedback to improve Sudowrite. However, we do not use your writing to train Sudowrite or OpenAI's AI models.\n\nBefore I sign up, how do I cancel? It’s easy.

The idea of using AI and ML to generate text has been floating around since the '60s (shoutout to ELIZA). And the modern era of AI writing tools has been in full swing since the release of GPT-3 aaaall the way back\n\nHow to Write a Book with ChatGPT (+ a Better Alternative)\n\nIf you’re thinking about writing a book with AI, ChatGPT is probably pretty tempting. It’s free (or, at the very least, cheap), crazy smart, and able to adapt to any prompt you throw at it. Well… almost any prompt. If you head over to ChatGPT and write: * “Generate",

      "# [We’re hiring one amazing human to lead community at Sudowrite](https://editor.sudowrite.com/jobs-community/)\nDo you love community strategy & metrics as much as you love writing? Are you energized by helping, welcoming, and empowering others? Then read on...\n\nAI: It’ll either kill us all or create a utopian renaissance situation like the world has never seen.\n\nWe’re working really hard to make sure it’s the latter.\n\nWe make this thing called Sudowrite. It’s the best tool for long-form writers ever made. Over 8,000 authors use it to publish novels, screenplays, short stories, and lots of other things.\n\nOur writers tell us it helps them write 2-3× as fast, get unblocked, and finish novels that had languished for years. If G.R.R. Martin had this thing, book six would have been out years ago.\n\nWe’re growing fast. We 5Xed revenue and customers in the last six months. We have something real here.\n\nWe’re 💥 profitable 💥. We’ve hit product-market fit and now we’re just trying to keep up with demand. Our team is small (just 5) and we’re all really good at what we do. We’ve been featured in The New Yorker and lots of other places you’ve heard of. Just last month, a book written using Sudowrite was reviewed in the New York Times.\n\nOur company was started by repeat founders, both writers, both down-to-earth, decent people with prior exits. Our investors aren’t too shabby, either.\n\nIf you’ve played the startup game before, you know that nothing in life is certain. That said, we have strong fundamentals, we believe AI is here to stay, and our business is working.\n\nOur community is core to our success. In fact, the vast majority of people find us through word of mouth.\n\nAuthors hear about us in discords and slacks and facebook groups and subreddits. We have a friendly Slack community with over 3,500 people. Every day, members help each other learn how to use the Sudowrite.\n\nWe have a fledgling ambassadors program with volunteers from all over the world. They hold Zoom sessions to help other authors, answer questions in Slack, and document best practices. They are amazing.\n\nWe also build features with dozens and sometimes hundreds of community members giving feedback directly to our product team. We talk to and learn from our customers daily.\n\nCommunity isn’t a nice-to-have, it’s part of our product.\n\nWe want our community to become THE reason people choose to join Sudowrite. We want a supportive, ambitious, and vibrant community that is as much the product as the app itself.\n\nThese days, Ryan (our designer) runs weekly community calls, teaches classes on how to use Sudowrite, and works with our ambassadors.\n\nJames (one of our founders) and Josh (one of our engineers) worked closely with hundreds of community testers to build our newest feature.\n\nAmit (the other founder) actively answers questions about sudowrite on reddit and facebook, and is helping with ambassadors.\n\nAnd all of us actively answer questions in the community Slack and solicit feedback.\n\nWe believe a stronger community = a stronger business\n\nWe believe great stories change minds & thus change the world.\n\nWe believe tools like Sudowrite are enabling a creative renaissance.\n\nWe believe learning from and supporting each other is the key to making this all work.\n\nWe believe a stronger community directly leads to a stronger business.\n\nHere’s where\n\nyou come in…\n\nWe want a visionary, compassionate, detail-oriented do-er who can own all aspects of community. Someone who loves trying new things, moves quickly, and wakes up each morning energized by this stuff.\n\nRight now, we believe community encompasses talking with current and future customers, content marketing, and program management, but this may evolve as we learn more about what our community members need most.\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nWork directly with our founders to create, then own our community strategy\n\nEstablish and monitor key metrics + reporting systems representing our community health\n\nGrow our community and optimize the funnel from community to customer\n\nOversee and improve our educational system - including live classes and youtube videos\n\nOversee content - including docs, blogs, emails, and collaborating with external content creators\n\nGrow our ambassador program - empowering our best writers to share their gifts\n\nFacilitate community involvement in product decisions\n\nMaintain a great vibe in our community spaces\n\nMaintain presence wherever writers talk about us - facebook, discords, subreddits, etc. (up for discussion)\n\nThis is your dream job if you…\n\nLive and breathe community and care deeply about people\n\nBring a quantitative mindset to community growth\n\nLove to set and deliver on ambitious goals\n\nLove to write and have participated in writer communities\n\nAre motivated by our mission and vision for the future\n\nAre able to manage multiple projects with high attention to detail\n\nRequired experience\n\n4-6 years of community experience\n\nExperience growing an early customer base or community\n\nThings you may have done\n\nBuilt an online community with over 1000 members\n\nRun online or in-person events\n\nOperated a writing community, workshop, or taught writing\n\nBeen part of the early growth stage of a successful startup in a growth, marketing, product, community management, or operations role\n\nOther things to know\n\nRemote-first- We’re fully and unapologetically remote. Heck, no two people even live in the same city. We meet up a few times a year, the last few times in Yosemite 🏞 , the Hudson valley 🗽, and Hawaii 🌴. We hang out on Zoom on Thursdays and have a monthly book club.\n\nWork-life balance- We don’t expect you to spend 80 hours a week at your desk, and we don’t plan to, either. Sometimes things get busy, but it shouldn’t be the norm. We have lives outside of work, and we want you to as well.\n\nCompetitive compensation & benefits- We’ll pay you 110K base salary and 0.4% equity or $80K salary and 0.5% equity. We’ll help you set up your home office, and you’ll have good health and dental insurance and unlimited paid time off (vacation, sick, holidays). Also, all the books you want.\n\nOkay, you got me. How do I apply?\n\nstep 1: Email us at community@sudowrite.com . Tell us why this is your dream job, why you’re our dream community person, and send us any relevant work.\n\nstep 2: We’ll carefully review your application and either do a 30 minute call or kindly thank you for applying and feel really bad if it’s not a fit but that’s just how it goes sometimes.\n\nstep 3: If we’re both into it, you’ll do a short assignment\n\nstep 4: We’ll chat with your references\n\nstep 5: You’ll meet the rest of the team over Zoom\n\nstep 6: 🎉\n\nWe can’t wait to meet you!"

I mean, there's the one mentioned already but I found out you have to use a personal API key and there's more stuff to it. Kinda turned me off because I just want to get in and write. Have you tried the cheaper models on Sudowrite? Claude Haiku is pretty good with instructions and has a cheaper cost. While Mistral is also good with instructions but needs a bit more editing. If I remember right, they also have a quick chat (Chat GPT 3.5 which is free in the app itself, so you don't have to work outside the app).\n\n## Comment ID ldef2r9 with +3 score by [(killerdinodeeno, Reddit, 2024-07-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/ldef2r9/) (in reply to ID 1e47dyi):\nAll in all, it’s about the same amount of effort to get set up to write between Sudowrite and NovelCrafter. If you think about what goes into SW from the perspective of setting up the beats, etc. Neither produce great prose right out of the gate. But yeah, from a UI perspective (plug and play) SW is better for beginners. \n\nPersonally, I switched from SW to NC about a year ago because I was tired of wasting my monthly credits on prose that wasn’t useable. NC with the API key though OpenRouter (so it’s just 1 key) lets me play with so so many different models. And NC let’s you customize prompts, wheat SW doesn’t. I like having that level of control. Once you get used to it, I’ve found it to be much better and cheaper than SW. That’s just my opinion, though. I definitely encourage anyone who is new to AI tools to try them out and see what works for you and your process.\n\n### Comment ID ldehxh5 with +1 score by [(ecchirhino99, Reddit, 2024-07-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/ldehxh5/) (in reply to ID ldef2r9):\nTo use novelcrafter to chat edit(review) a scene you need tier 3 subscription artisan tier?

Tier 3 gives you additional features like Workshop. I'm not sure what all that is, as I've been using NC since it was in beta and got access to the paid version right when it was released. \n\nMost people use OpenRouter for the credits, and the price per model is set by them/the LLM provider (NC has no control over model prices). Some models are more expensive than others, like Claude Opus, but there are lots of free models available on OpenRouter as well.\n\n## Comment ID ldex7y1 with +3 score by [(PiccoloGold3510, Reddit, 2024-07-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/ldex7y1/) (in reply to ID 1e47dyi):\nThere’s nothing wrong with SudoWrite, but it really depends what you’re trying to do.\n\nTools like NovelCrafter are more expensive for a reason. $14/mo is reasonable for a powerful tool that has a lively community of authors that use it as a daily driver. It’s a workhorse, and they are always working on updates that people actually want.\n\nAt the same time, if you’re not ready to take the plunge, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with just using TypingMind and connect it to your OpenRouter account. If you’re just inserting beats into an existing scene, chat might be all you need.\n\nAlso consider the possibility that if what you really want is fresh, original, truly creative writing that the world has never seen before, written in a voice that is all your own, then you’re going to have to write it yourself. The cost is your time and maybe some overdue fees at the library.\n\n### Comment ID ldfuq2o with +3 score by [(ecchirhino99, Reddit, 2024-07-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/ldfuq2o/) (in reply to ID ldex7y1):\nWhile testing novelcrafter, I can see now that sudowrite cost of prompts seem to be inflated to the extreme. I can generate responses using the same ai models at a fraction of the cost. \nTho sudowrite interface is excellent and my only gripe with it is the limited text boxes.\n\nI write mainly about world building related staff so I use ai a lot to generate scene to introduce those concepts I design.\nAlso I will always let an ai to go over the wording choices to  improve the writing quality.\n\n## Comment ID ldki7t0 with +1 score by [(shimmerbby, Reddit, 2024-07-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/ldki7t0/) (in reply to ID 1e47dyi):\nNovelcrafter is the next best thing out there tbh.\n\n## Comment ID lut0gnf with +1 score by [(No_Honeydew1716, Reddit, 2024-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/lut0gnf/) (in reply to ID 1e47dyi):\nAlguém sabe um site que é parecido com sudowrite só que de graça??

It is amazing for helping get my ideas and characters into a tight outline.\n\nBut I dispute that the content can pass for an actual novel or match tones. People get more and more heavily into complex headers and guardrails and style guide and beats and genre, but the output still has \"that AI feel\"--piercing blue eyes, tidy bows, affirmations, cliches, rushing through scenes, etc. \n\nI'm not aware of anything that has the same full-suite features and structures as Sudowrite. \n\nFor matching tones, NovelAi is the best and cheapest, because it is guided by what you write and picks up your tones and characterisation in a quite amazing way. And it lets you tinker a lot under the hood. But it doesn't help at all with structuring and plotting, which IMO is Sudo's strength.\n\nIt's possible that what would work for you best is a free LLM like LLama2 or CGPT for plotting and character sketches, and NA for actual writing (copy the character sketches into Lorebooks). Even the cheapest tier of NA had the highest level of context and unlimited generations with Clio, which is a pretty good model.\n\n#### Comment ID k3crgss with +2 score by [(NoYesterday7832, Reddit, 2023-10-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/k3crgss/) (in reply to ID k3codl8):\nHow are you doing that?

It allowed for some pretty cool stuff. \n\nThen I switched to NovelAI and liked it a LOT better. It was far easier to use it as a writing assistant without needing convoluted prompts. \n\nThen I started using GPT-3 directly in the playground. I found myself mostly using the playground vs NovelAI. It was likely more expensive (pay per use rather than monthly) but I found the results were MUCH better - especially with short prompts (I had the playground write a beat sheet for a novel without any further explanation and it did a good job!)\n\nI tried Goose playground as well and found it was a lot weaker. \n\nMore recently I have been using Sudowrite. I have been VERY impressed. It uses GPT3 as its backend but I have found the stuff I get from it is better than my attempts in the playground (they must have really optimized the prompts in the background somehow). And the pricing is right (I wonder if they will just lose money on some hard core users?)\n\nHas anyone else here compared the two? What do people find NovelAI better for? I can’t imagine not using Sudo now, but if there are strong NovelAI use cases I am missing I am price insensitive enough I could subscribe to both….\n\n## Comment ID i7mhn7a with +20 score by [(superamit, Reddit, 2022-05-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/i7mhn7a/) (in reply to ID uj4zg7):\nGlad to hear you're enjoying Sudowrite!\n\nWe do a lot of work under the hood to tune our prompts for fiction, as well as doing pre/post-processing to improve quality.\n\nIf you have any questions about Sudowrite, feel free to ask!\n\nAmit\nCo-Founder, Sudowrite\n\n### Comment ID iy17l1y with +2 score by [(Firm-Engineering2948, Reddit, 2022-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/iy17l1y/) (in reply to ID i7mhn7a):\nHi\n\nI'm currently trying to use Sudowrite free trial on my phone.\n\nAs soon as I get to the \"insert\" part, I cannot continue because of screen size.

That's tricky to offer advice for since a lot of it is just about having the right kind of gut feeling to play into the AI's strength, and the the only way to get that is through the experience of using it.\n\nIn particular to the output length, I don't try to extend past the default, but instead I just generate multiple times if I feel like the AI is hitting a good vibe. There are a number of things which are only reevaluated when a new generation starts (chief among them being lorebook keys), so my impression is that the quality of long outputs tends to degrade severely over time.\n\n## Comment ID lgnijn0 with +3 score by [(whywhatwhenwhoops, Reddit, 2024-08-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/1ekf637/is_there_a_way_to_make_novelai_similar_to/lgnijn0/) (in reply to ID 1ekf637):\nWhat do mean by a config more like sudowrite?

Author is self-explanatory (just needs to be well-known enough that the model gets the reference). Title can be anything that sort of conveys the feel or topic. Tags can be words or phrases that convey themes and concepts you want in the story, comma-delineated if you want to use multiple, just don't go overboard). And Genre should be a well-established genre term, such as the lists of literary genres found on Wikipedia or Amazon.\n\nYou can leave out fields you don't want to use, just maintain the format (spaces between the brackets and the tag line, and each field separated by semicolons).\n\nStyle is fairly flexible. It should be a comma-delineated list of words or phrases (like Tags), but more about the kind of writing you want to see. There are trained in phrases (such as \"prose\", \"complex\", etc...), but many words will work (\"descriptive\", \"sensory\", etc...). [Here are some examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/18corhv/style_tags_for_sensory_language/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) of sensory language tags, but there is no fixed list, so feel free to experiment with soemthing that you think might fit your story.\n\nEdit: Beyond that, play around with different config presets, maybe try out some of the community ones from Discord. Between all of these, you can get extremely evocative writing that puts pretty much any other AI to shame. \"Logic\" is still a weak point though.\n\n## Comment ID lgtkws3 with +2 score by [(bobsburger4776, Reddit, 2024-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/1ekf637/is_there_a_way_to_make_novelai_similar_to/lgtkws3/) (in reply to ID 1ekf637):\nIs sudowrtie completely uncensored now?

It’s a great way to get a ton of value. Plus, Sudowrite's Quick Tools, like *Quick Edit* and *Quick Chat*, are *unlimited* and included free with the plans. I'm always using them to make light edits or have a chat directly within my document, making the writing process smoother and more integrated.\n\nHere's an example of prose generated using your sentence starter with the Chat4o Mini model:\n\n>She inspects the hammer with careful precision, her fingers lightly tracing the worn wooden handle. It had seen better days—splintered at the edge, coated in a fine layer of dust that hinted at years of neglect. But it was its head that intrigued her most. The metal glinted under the flickering fluorescent light, marred by splotches of something dark and unidentifiable.\n\n>Marjorie glanced around the cramped workshop, the air thick with the scent of rust and old wood. The walls were lined with tools of all kinds, each one telling a story she was desperate to unravel. But this hammer… it felt crucial. The sound of distant sirens echoed through the open window. Time was running out.\n\n>Her heart raced as she replayed the events of the night before—the confrontation with Richard, his wild accusations, then that chilling silence when he’d stormed out into the rain. She had thought it was just another argument, another moment lost in their spiraling relationship. But now? Now she understood there was something darker at play.\n\n>She slipped a small flashlight from her pocket and directed its beam onto the workbench beside her. There, half-hidden beneath a pile of scrap metal, lay a crumpled piece of paper. Instinct told her to be cautious, but curiosity drove her closer. As she extended her hand, her eyes caught more stains on the floor—ominous dark patches that trailed from the bench to the back door.\n\n>Was Richard here? Or had someone else entered this place during their fight? The questions ignited a fire in her gut that made her pulse quicken. Marjorie hesitated only a moment longer before unfolding the paper, every creak and crinkle seeming thunderous in the tense air around her.\n\n>Words began to form —a name scrawled hastily across the top: Arthur Blackwood.

      "# Post ID 193gi4w: Struggling with Sudowrite with +16 score by [(PartyMuffinButton, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/)\nI had NovelAI for a while, and was quite happy with it, but it was very back-n-forth, and I was editing (or fully rewriting) a lot of its output. Whenever I ran the story stats, it was at least 85% my content. And that’s fine! But I was really looking for something that would take my prose and _run with it_, so I decided to try out Sudowrite. \n\nI literally only just got started, but already I’m feeling a bit _ugh_ about the whole thing. I spent around 3 hours creating all of my backstory, character definitions, example writing, etc. I was very specific about the perspective (‘I’ am the narrator, ‘you’ are the main character, as if I’m telling the story _to you_). \n\nImmediately, it got it wrong. It started writing in the first person for the wrong character. And despite giving it a decent example of my writing and style, it sounded absolutely nothing like me. So I paused it, intent on correcting it… and it just _kept going_. For minutes. It spat out around a thousand words before it finally decided to pause. \n\nI then spent another hour rewriting almost _all_ of that first block - changing the character perspective, rewriting big chunks of it, and then adding some of my own, carrying the story on (and following my predefined beats).\n\nI finally got to a good jumping-off point and inserted it over the previously-generated text, then hit ‘continue’…\n\n…and it just kicked off as if I’d done nothing. It started from exactly where I’d stopped it before, ignoring everything I’d written. It immediately jumped back to writing the character from the first-person (rather than the second), and with that same pulp-fiction prose that sounds nothing like me.\n\nI’ve used a fair few generative AI tools, and what I’m used to is them taking the backstory/permanent memory/definitions etc., and then the _context_ of what’s been written (like its ‘short-term memory’) to inform what it writes next. But Sudowrite seemed to just… ignore me?\n\nI assume I’m doing something wrong, but I’ve got no idea how to fix it. I know Sudowrite have a Discord, but I find group-chat apps way too _noisy_.\n\nHas anyone got any experience with this, and any tips on how to ~~shove~~ nudge it in the direction I want?\n\n## Comment ID kh99cvl with +7 score by [(ironic_cat555, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/kh99cvl/) (in reply to ID 193gi4w):\nIsn't I am the narrator and I'm telling the story to you second person?  If so a more detailed explanation than second person might just confuse it.\n\nIf you are using the story engine feature Sudowrite's story engine doesn't really have the ability to analyze your writing style.  When you upload your writing sample all it does is generate a description of your writing style.  Which means they pass that description on to the AI not your prose.   I don't know if generating prose in the chapter, kind of like NovelAI rather than in story engine would work better.\n\nStart off by generating small amounts of text (just 2 to 4 beats) and see if you can get it to work how you want it to.  Then it won't continue writing for a long time.\n\nAlso the discord has a lot of helpful people in it. \n\nThat said if you are usually doing SFW stuff you might be better off trying Claude 2.  At 100k or 200k contexts you can paste a huge writing sample and tell it to imitate your style.\n\n### Comment ID kha7mdd with +1 score by [(PartyMuffinButton, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/kha7mdd/) (in reply to ID kh99cvl):\nRe: POV - yes, but regardless it ignores how I’d defined the characters and their pronouns (it made the second character the first, and is ignoring corrections). \n\nI had a conversation with someone at sudowrite a few days ago and asked them about ‘Story Engine’ because I didn’t see it. He explained that it used to be a separate thing, but now they’ve bundled everything together, so Sudowrite _is_ story engine now, from what I can gather.\n\nI’ll try with shorter beats and see how it goes, but I think I’ve found a major flaw in how it generates stories, and I’m worried I might now be stuck without erasing everything and starting again (basically it iterates through ‘beats’ and when I go back and ~~rewrite everything~~ correct it, setting the story back a little bit, it both a) continues to ignore my style, and 2) gets confused about where it is.

Story engine is now the Chapter Generator feature.  But there's an alternative way to generate prose which is using the \"write\" \"rewrite\" \"describe\" buttons in the chapter text area.  That's the one more like Novel AI that I  meant.\n\nIf the story engine is screwing up just pause it, it'll only go to the end of the current two beats, then change the instructions in the beats then hit restart after deleting the bad prose and try again.  \"Most accurate\" is the ai most likely to follow your instructions.\n\n#### Comment ID khabap9 with +1 score by [(superamit, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/khabap9/) (in reply to ID kha7mdd):\nWere you putting \"Second-person POV\" in the style?

Plus, after their pricing change, I (not on an active subscription), seem to have lost all the words from my extra pack I'd bought back when I was on Max.

I get that Sudowrite can feel a bit like a maze at first, and running low on credits doesn't help. Transparent talk first. I'm an ambassador for them. So, Sudowrite packs in a ton of features to boost your writing, which can be a lot to take in. Here's a quick guide to help you organize your chapter ideas:\n\n**Editor**: This is your main writing area, much like Google Docs or Word. Draft your chapters here.\n\n**Story Engine**: Great for plotting out your novel. You can dump your story ideas, set the genre and style, and let it help craft a synopsis. It also aids in building characters and outlines. \n\n**Story Bible**: Think of this as your reference guide for all story elements like characters, settings, plot points etc to keep everything consistent.\n\n**Plugins:** Sudowrite offers plugins to add new features without needing to code. These can introduce fresh ways to write, edit, and analyze your work. \n\nCheck out the \"[Quick Start](https://docs.sudowrite.com/getting-started/dQph1snuwbfMWG9wRjsNug/quick-start/2A4FjtiocrtxHPUyz6WZgR)\" guide. It gives an overview of Sudowrite’s interface and tools in under 11 minutes. \n\nSo those credits... Sudowrite uses a credit system; each AI feature uses up some credits. To make the most of them you need to know that different features eat different amounts of credits. For example, generating longer passages with a full Character Cast or having thick entries in Worldbuilding or using the latest AI models might use more credits. But there are cheaper AI models that write almost as good and cost next to nothing like GPT 4o Mini. \n\nBuy Extra Credits if Needed: If you run out but want to keep going, you can buy one-time extra credits. These don't expire and stay with your account until used. \n\nAlso, \"Quick Tools\" like Quick Edit and Quick Chat are included with your subscription and don't use credits unless you switch on High Quality mode. \n\nIf you need more help, feel free to ask.

I don’t pay for GPT or OpenRouter, so I don’t have anything I can use without paying for the middle tier (unless I’ve missed something).\n\nI might need to spend more time with NovelCrafter  - after a bunch of people suggested it, I figured I’d love it, but… 🤷🏻‍♀️\n\n#### Comment ID kp92468 with +11 score by [(ZobeidZuma, Reddit, 2024-02-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/kp92468/) (in reply to ID kp8y37n):\nI started with Sudowrite, then recently got Novelcrafter.\n\nI've been flogging Novelcrafter for a couple of weeks, and rapidly learning to love it. I followed the tutorials and got an account with OpenRouter, got it hooked up, and it's working great. It doesn't seem that expensive to me.\n\nWith Sudowrite I always feel like there's a lot of friction as I struggle to get it to do what I want. Gradually filling out the Codex in Novelcrafter seems more natural to me, and the AI tends to actually follow what's in the Codex, for the most part. I don't feel like I'm typing in more-and-more instructions that are just going to be ignored, which has sometimes been the case in Sudowrite.\n\n## Comment ID kp8vlxq with +17 score by [(Clueless_Nooblet, Reddit, 2024-02-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/kp8vlxq/) (in reply to ID 1akj00y):\nNovelAI is its very special thing, mostly great for pantsers. You start, and Kayra picks up, then you take over again and switch with Kayra periodically. \n\nNovelCrafter is great for plotters, with lots of tools even Scrivener is lacking, and it's the cheapest option with the most flexible system (can bring your own API keys or even use a locally run model).\n\nSudowrite is an overpriced, lesser version of Novelcrafter. It was the first tool of this sort and used its monopoly to jack up the prices.

The difference is that Novelcrafter’s “Codex” (the equivalent of Sudowrite’s “Story Bible”), Scene summaries and all other things you can pre-establish, are considerably more flexible and, to some extent, Novelcrafter “expects” you to use them to guide the generation. But it doesn’t *force* you to, so in theory you could use both the same way, yes.\n\n#### Comment ID kpcd5s1 with +1 score by [(Clueless_Nooblet, Reddit, 2024-02-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/kpcd5s1/) (in reply to ID kp93s61):\nYeah, that's also possible.

I've got it working pretty well here.  Maybe I can offer some suggestions.\n\nIt's important to understand which codex entries are visible to the AI.  Your characters, for example. . .  When you create a new codex entry and select \"character\" type, it should *track* that entry.  What that means is, if NC sees that character name in your prompt, then it'll provide that codex entry to the LLM.  It'll become part of the context for that scene.  So when you are writing your prompt for a scene beat, you should mention all the characters who are present in that scene *by name*.  You may have dozens of characters in your story, but NC will only show the LLM its cards for the ones that you mentioned in the prompt.  That keeps the LLM from being overwhelmed with too much information that's not relevant.\n\nYou can go into the **Plan** tab and then the **Matrix** view, and Novelcrafter will show you a grid with all the characters it's tracking, and which scenes they appear in.\n\nRaces. . .  Let's say you have a race of \"gnomes\" in your story.  If you haven't mentioned the word \"gnome\" in your prompt, the LLM might never get the info.  There are a couple of ways to fix this.  One is to go into the entries for your gnome characters and give each of them a Nested Reference to the gnome race.  Then, any time one of those characters gets pulled into the context, the card on gnomes gets pulled in too.  You can also do that with factions that various characters are members of, etc.\n\nIn each codex entry you can find a tab called **References** and a couple of options under **REFERENCE TRACKING**.  One option you can check is \"Always include this entry in the AI context.\"  If you switch that on, then the card will *always* be visible to the LLM.  You want to use this for things like genre and style that always apply to every part of your story.  You can also use it for important bits of lore.  The only reason not to over-use it is, like I said, to not overwhelm the LLM with the entire contents of your Codex and stuff that's not relevant to the task.\n\nAll of the *scene summaries* are also part of the LLM context!  That means keeping your scene summaries up-to-date is super helpful to the AI knowing where it is and what it's doing.  You can get your choice of AI to write those summaries for you, so there's no excuse.  Once you have a scene completed to your satisfaction, with a few clicks you can have the AI reading it and writing a summary of the important events, which then becomes part of its knowledge base for generating future scenes.\n\nIf you are set up with OpenRouter, you have a lot of LLMs available, and you can experiment freely.  However. . .  In my experience there are only a few that give top results.  ChatGPT is always reliable.  At this moment, Claude was recently updated and produces the very best output.  Claude has become pretty smart, and if he is routinely getting confused, it almost certainly means that he's not getting the context he needs from Novelcrafter.\n\n## Comment ID krrh7w8 with +6 score by [(MeridianASK, Reddit, 2024-02-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/krrh7w8/) (in reply to ID 1akj00y):\nDon't use any of them.

Novelcrafter is great with OpenRouter, and allows you to use a shitload of models - but Sudowrite has a good spread of them too. \n\nOverall, I'd say **NovelAI** is the best all-rounder. It's cheaper for heavy users since there's no character limit, but you do sometimes need to get a little more into the settings and lore memory to get results you like. But it's fast, flexible, has a nice UI, and will let you type 24/7 for as long as you like. \n\n**Novelcrafter** is a close second to **Sudowrite** for me. I really like Novelcrafter - Openrouter gets you a ton of versatility for really *cheap* - but frankly, 75% of those models aren't really going to see use. What's more, I've found it kind of difficult to use seamlessly with natural writing - though perhaps, I don't know enough.  My main gripes are that:   \n **1)** You have to break out of prose to do a / command for continuing the story - and it, *afaik,* doesn't do a very good job of reading previous text for context, and you have to write a blurb telling it what you want to do. With Sudowrite and Novelai, it's a keypress and it picks up where you left off seamlessly, letting you tweak from there.   \n**2)** You can generate one thing, with one model, at a time. One of my favorite things about Sudowrite is parallel generating *2 or more cards*. Plus, since fiddling with length is unintuitive in NC, you often end up with a long generation that veers off course in the middle, and you have to repeat **1)** again in the middle of your passage. \n\nSudowrite's biggest downside is that it's less flexible and customizable, and far more expensive per generation than Novelcrafter. \n\nI *want* to like Novelcrafter, but using it right now feels hard and unrewarding - writing the same thing in Sudowrite or Nai, I get much farther much faster than with Novelcrafter. \n\nPlease, do sell me on novelcrafter - I'd love to see it dethrone the others at that price point, but as it stands, I'm torn between NovelAi and Sudowrite.\n\n### Comment ID l6abrbj with +1 score by [(Dude_Man_Bro_Sir, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/l6abrbj/) (in reply to ID l6a4j3l):\nThank you for the detailed write up. I've alternated between NAI and NC since I posted this so I have some thoughts about the two tools.\n\nI agree with your points about NAI and NC.\n\nI like the way NAI produces output and is very fluid/natural with my own writing. NC, on the other hand, also provides chatbot functionality with the same models I picked for story generation (only the two models too) but the story generation is kind of clunky and needs instructions to produce content.\n\nConversely, I like NC's lore book, planning, and shelving system more than NAI's. NC allows you to create a series so you can group together different stories (or books) that occur in the same series. It can be entirely different stories or it can be a sequence of stories.\n\nWhile NAI does have a shelving system that also groups stories together, NC's system has the added benefit of making it so a lore entry can be book-level or series-level. So, you don't necessarily have to remake a lore entry if you make a new story with the same characters or in the same setting as the previous one. Unfortunately, NAI doesn't have that and you need to export it from the previous story and import it into the new story.\n\nNC also offers a more robust story planning system, where you can create a story outline with separate acts, chapters, and scenes. It has the benefit of making it easy to traverse your story if you need to go back to a different chapter or jump to the current one to continue typing.\n\nNAI puts it all into one document so if you want to separate the story into chapters, you can either create a new story in the shelf (and import the lore book) or separate the document into different chapters with \"Chapter 1\", etc, and then using CTRL + F to jump between chapters.\n\nI can't really say to use one over the other at this stage since both NC and NAI have their pros and cons still.\n\n#### Comment ID l6ahld7 with +3 score by [(waker1771, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/l6ahld7/) (in reply to ID l6abrbj):\nI think that NC is probably more useful for heavy outliners and those with a large-scale work in mind. It offers a lot more horsepower in that regard for sure. \n\nI'd be curious to hear your take on Sudowrite - I had hoped for a super clear-cut winner (don't we all?) in all this, so I could subscribe to one service alone without headache.   \n  \nUnfortunately, just like a lot of things, there's all sorts of pros and cons to weigh. \n\nI'd say my final breakdown looks something like this:   \n  \n**Sudowrite** is best in class for high-volume, quality output with minimal tweaking, and a useful, very intuitive writing toolset. But, you lose fine model control, some flexibility, and it's more costly. So if you want to fully realize an idea fully the fastest, and/or get more AI assistance, it's a winner.\n\n**Novelcrafter** gives very robust planning, lore, and outline tools, chat functions, and unmatched model availability for a low cost, but you lose that speedy workflow and high, multi-generation output. If you want to write a full-length novel in a large, cohesive universe, albeit with slightly less AI assistance, it's a great fit. \n\n**NovelAI** is a great all-rounder and adapts to style very well. It's snappy, reliable, and flexible; with unlimited generation. But, you may need to tinker a bit more than others, and there's no matching Openrouter's model breadth. Less high-volume than Sudowrite, but more than NC. If you're looking for reliable, strong writing with a high degree of output control, look no further.   \n  \nPersonally, I think NAI is starting to fall behind SW and NC with their access to newer, cutting edge LLM models, since NAI develops their own. For pros, NAI really manages to avoid the common AI phrasing and repetition pitfalls, feels more authentic and original, and is better at adapting to author style. As a con, though, it is a bit slower to adapt when there's large leaps made.\n\n## Comment ID kz7511s with +1 score by [(MnG_FGO_GT, Reddit, 2024-04-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/kz7511s/) (in reply to ID 1akj00y):\nI want to ask something.

      "# Post ID 1dvnmix: My Experience with Sudowrite with +18 score by [(Direct-Secretary-279, Reddit, 2024-07-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1dvnmix/my_experience_with_sudowrite/)\nI thought I'd share some thoughts for those curious about this program, especially since they have been hitting the advertising hard on Facebook lately.\n\nI went to check it out almost a year ago now. According to my history I uploaded my 90% completed manuscript on August 8th 2023.  I was having some writer's block and figured it couldn't hurt. On that piece I used primarily the Write feature in Auto mode. It got me through my writer's block and now that I've done one full edit and am in the middle of the second there is only one paragraph that I still recognise as being the AI's writing and not mine.  I haven't gotten to the chapter (third from the end) in the second edit so by the time I'm finished that should be corrected.\n\nMy day job is in taxes so I have a big chunk of the summer off.  I decided that $20 for a single month was worth trying out in my free time and despite finishing the first book in the series in late August, I had only been able to get three chapters into book 2.\n\nBetween August 2023 and April 2024 Sudowrite has made many changes including expanding the story bible to include better character bios. Since I was starting basically from scratch, I took the time to complete every field and truthfully it took me from early April to mid June. I was able to link my existing chapters to the outline and then, because I didn't have enough trial credits left I made my purchase and then I used the the generate chapter feature.\n\nI used the generate beat for the chapter and the beats progressed exactly the way they should. When I then generated the chapter.... OH MAN...  I was not prepared for it to be THAT BAD!!  I'd used the write feature to just pick up where I stopped and that is solidly useful. Even if I only use one sentence, it always helps me get moving again.\n\nThe generate chapter AI however was bad.  There were lets say 10 beats in the chapter and each beat was about a sentence. The subsequent generation transitioned beat1-2, 2-3, 3-4, etc. and the amount of the same characters reentering rooms they were already in, completing the same action again but with a different side action, or other junk writing was EVERYWHERE!!!  \n\nI wrote an extremely long email to Sudowrite with examples galore. I wasn't nice about how bad I thought it was compared to their other features and that for the time being they weren't going to get any more of my money.  \n\nBut now I had hundreds of thousands of credits and I still had all this free time.  So I kept working with it.  At first I just use the Write feature again, sometimes Guided and other times Auto. I got two chapters done quick and I felt like it was all moving. \n\nTo back track a bit, my biggest complaint with Chapter Generation wasn't even the repetition. My biggest issue was that the Story Bible knew the secret, knew the answer to the mystery and it kept wanting to spoil that!  Every other paragraph it was talking about the secret that wasn't supposed to be anything more than odd behavior until the middle of Act 2. The write feature didn't do this to me.\n\nWell, I saw their post that they had rolled out an update and I also went back to look at the beats the AI had created for me.  I saw that at least some of the problem had been that the beats were too detailed and I reread the directions to make sure that each beat could generate about 200 words worth of content. Alright. Time to try again.\n\nI generated beats for my next chapter and then refined them from 16 down to 7 with three sentences each. I made sure none of the action between beats overlapped. You know what?  It was very usable!  I was able to take the 12 to 16 paragraphs it generated and expand that out to almost 3000 words without having to remove large chunks. It did what Sudowrite's mission says its going to do. They say that writing is mostly about editing and refining so why not spend your time there. I was very happy.  \n\nAs I kept playing with the tools it became clear that if I knew how I wanted a scene to go then I should just write that scene (or whole chapter) but the upgrade of both the engine and my skill worked well.\n\nEven better: the upgrade stopped the leaking of the secret!  \n\nThe best (for me) however was that in getting the 'second perspective' of the AI, followed by the third perspective of my boyfriend, I realized that the reason I had been so stuck was that I was trying too hard to hold on to my secret. I realized that without the characters knowing something about it (It in my case being a made up synthetic drug with specific effects) the characters had to attribute the actions of the person effected by the drug as being part of who they are and that wasn't the story I wanted to tell.  I want to tell the story of how the MC's friends gather around her to help her fight back against the drug and the people who dosed her with it.\n\nSudowrite helped me fix my plot and now I'm writing it on my own at the same rapid pace I wrote the first book in the series.  It was absolutely worth the cost for the help alone.  The skills I learned in the meantime on how to better utilize it: well they let me finish some side pieces never to published for profit in a week each. \n\n\n\n## Comment ID lbt8kox with +5 score by [(KaristinaLaFae, Reddit, 2024-07-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1dvnmix/my_experience_with_sudowrite/lbt8kox/) (in reply to ID 1dvnmix):\nSudowrite can help you do a lot, but it helps if you know what all the features are and how to use them. It's also very helpful to join their Discord and talk with other authors who use it to learn tips and tricks for different workflows!\n\nI'm glad you've been able to make it work for you. 😊\n\n(Disclosure: I'm a Sudowrite ambassador, but I was made an ambassador because I'm an enthusiastic user, not the other way around. We teach a lot of free classes about different ways to use the various parts of Sudowrite, so drop in on Zoom sometime!)\n\n### Comment ID lygtylf with +1 score by [(Low_Ad_714, Reddit, 2024-11-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1dvnmix/my_experience_with_sudowrite/lygtylf/) (in reply to ID lbt8kox):\nCan I enter all my character bios and chapters at the start of the process and see what it does?  My book is historical fiction drama and mystery\n\n#### Comment ID lyi5jff with +1 score by [(KaristinaLaFae, Reddit, 2024-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1dvnmix/my_experience_with_sudowrite/lyi5jff/) (in reply to ID lygtylf):\nYes, there is something called Story Bible where you can put your synopsis, characters, worldbuilding elements, outline, etc. And if you use the Import Novel feature, it will generate a Story Bible for you based on whatever you've already written.\n\n## Comment ID lbp5y88 with +3 score by [(engineered_owl, Reddit, 2024-07-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1dvnmix/my_experience_with_sudowrite/lbp5y88/) (in reply to ID 1dvnmix):\nFor me, sudowrite has worked better when I'd an outline already done in another AI.

I used it for over a year but recently ditched it for Raptor Write. I still use Chat though. It seems like a lot of writers outgrow SW after a while. The concept is outdated now. When SW started, it was the only AI really for writing but now it's been left in the dust for newer things. Having your own API key is the best option because you have access to so many more AIs and you can control the costs. SW is insanely expensive. I was spending $29 a month for SW and didn't even use half of the credits and with Openrouter, it can take me weeks to use up $8 worth of credits while finishing even more projects than I do with SW. Plus, compared to other things, SW is clunky, the prose is bad, and I also don't like how SW doesn't roll credits over. That's a big problem for a lot of the users and why so many move on.\n\nI'm not knocking SW for others who feel it works best for them. We are all different but for me I can't justify spending $29 a month for AI when I can get just as much done through OR and not even spend $10 a month. SW turned into a big waste of money because it got to where I wasn't even using it much anymore and would have a million wasted credits. I also didn't find the quality that good anymore. I don't know why the prose from AIs like Claude are so much worse through SW than when you use them directly with your own API key. And I'm not the only one to notice this. Is SW using different versions of these AIs? Inferior versions? I don't know but the qualities of AIs offered through SW aren't half as good as just using the AI yourself.\n\nI do wonder if SW will ever allow the option of letting people use their own API key because with the way it is now, I don't see how SW is going to last much longer with all the competition and how expensive they are. When SW started, they had a lock on the writing AIs but not anymore and I bet in 2025 we'll see even more options come along. For example, Raptor Write is free, you just pay for the AI through Openrouter and can write a day of work without spending even a dollar if you know which AIs to use. The quality of using APIs through your own key is much better and cheaper than SW and that's the way the AI world is trending now.\n\n## Comment ID lbpfbgp with +1 score by [(ironic_cat555, Reddit, 2024-07-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1dvnmix/my_experience_with_sudowrite/lbpfbgp/) (in reply to ID 1dvnmix):\nAs an experiment I tried recently turning a professional novel into story beats, and it just doesn't  make sense to have these small one sentence story beats I think.\n\nGoogle Gemini if prodded to be detailed will have a story beat often consist of three small sub beats bullet points like this effectively three to four sentences:\n\n**2.

      "# [A neural net wrote my book. Kidding. Sort of. by leanneleeds.com on 2021-06-02](https://leanneleeds.com/artificial-intelligence-in-fiction/)\nThis FAQ has been getting missed in a big way, so I’m moving it up to the front.\n\n(Moved and updated 6-12-2024)\n\nIn June 2021, I began working with Sudowrite, an AI writing assistant for fiction writers. And by “working with,” I mean I started using the software. In July of 2022, I was featured fairly prominently in How independent writers are turning to AI – The Verge, but because they primarily used my real name (Jennifer Lepp) instead of my pen name (Leanne Leeds,) no one paid me much notice. AI use in fiction was getting far less attention than art-generating AI.\n\nAnd then ChatGPT blew that all to hell. (I did a follow-up interview on that, too though my pen name was a bit more prominently pointed out thanks to my complaint about my real name use.\n\nI didn’t think that one through.)\n\nAt this point, I’m seeing some things mentioned about me that are pretty inaccurate I felt the need to put this up. So, here we go.\n\nI read somewhere that you use AI/ChatGPT to generate all your books now.\n\nYep, I read that, too.\n\nWhen this all started, I didn’t honestly know how much of the AI-generated text I actually used because I just went with the flow and didn’t have too big a concern with keeping track. As this became a hotter and hotter topic (and I’ve seen statements from folks claiming I “generate” my books or have the AI “create” them,) I got curious, so I used PostSEO text compare to compare my finished chapter and the text that was generated by the AI in my session.\n\nThe following is a screenshot of the chapter I wrote yesterday, and this seems to be pretty average. I’ve had results as low as 8%, and as high as 11%. On average, 90% are the words from my brain, and 10% are the words from the #AI.\n\nI do not use AI for plot suggestions as some do—I know where my chapters and scenes are going, I use AI to phrase things better.\n\nWhat part of your books does ChatGPT write?\n\nNone. Almost all words in my books (the 10% above) are from Anthropic’s Claude.\n\nDo you write faster with AI? I read that you use AI to write fast.\n\nI read that, too (and said it was my goal before I read it.) Unfortunately, no. It still takes me six-seven weeks to write a book. I did not get any speed gain out of AI use because I still pretty much write the book. I just incorporate different aids to keep me moving or vary phrasings/ways to say things, Anthropic’s Claude being the predominant one.\n\nDo you teach people to use AI?\n\nI do not work for any AI company. Sudowrite did pay me to write a few blog posts sharing some of my tips and tricks while they looked for and hired a Community Leader, but I have never specifically taught any class or worked as an instructor for pay with regard to AI. My primary occupation is fiction writing, and that’s what I do for a living.\n\nYou’re a plagiarist! (Or you’re not a real writer, you’re cheating, and so on and so on)\n\nI personally don’t feel that AI companies are doing anything legally wrong, and I’m comfortable using artificial intelligence in my creative endeavors. I’m comfortable with the fact that I’m still a writer. I realize other people feel differently, and I respect that viewpoint and people’s choice not to use it or patronize people that do use it. Don’t buy my books if you hate all these things so much it makes you grind your teeth—any book that AI was used to edit has a statement to that effect in the book so readers can be informed.\n\nI am also, though, aware that this is a new frontier, and a court may decide to make some new law/update the law/re-explain the law in a way that it applies here, so I’ll be watching just like everyone else and will make changes in my own use if/when needed.\n\nTools I currently use:\n\nThis is current as of 11/10/2024.\n\nNovelCrafter – this software is exactly what I was looking for without AI. The Codex is game changing for me, the type of story bible ease I’ve been looking for. In fact, I only use the Codex, but you can use this with AI.\n\nQuillbot – to quickly rephrase sentences/as a thesaurus on a per sentence editing basis.\n\nAnthropic’s Claude – for fiction revising and rephrasing.\n\nGoogle’s NotebookLM – for querying my series.\n\nLitRPG Adventures – for fantasy locations and characters\n\nScribeShadow – Novel translations.\n\nTools I have used but no longer use:\n\nSudowrite – for fiction rewriting and work with narrative prose.\n\nPoe by Quora – Poe is a service developed by Quora and launched in December 2022. It allows access to a range of AI bots, including my two preferred LLMs: GPT-4o and Claude Opus. This cuts the access cost (ChatGPT+ at $20/m and Claude+ at $20/m) in half (Poe $20/m) and the number of messages allowed per month is more than enough for my use.\n\nChatGPT+ – for Dalle-3 and Vision. (I still use the LLM, just via API or Poe instead.)\n\nThings I wrote about the tools I’m using/was using:\n\n(Please note much of this is older information)\n\nSudowrite Tips and Tricks\n\nMy first days with Sudowrite (June 2021 – October 2021)\n\nArticles\n\n(Please note much of this is older information)\n\nNew Yorker: The Computers Are Getting Better at Writing\n\nThe Verge: The Great Fiction of AI: The strange world of high-speed semi-automated genre fiction – a long-form article that yours truly appears in.\n\nThe Verge: How Kindle novelists are using ChatGPT – an interview with me about the ChatGPT explosion\n\nAI-Generated Content and Copyright Law: What We Know (Posted Apr. 18, 2023 – this landscape is likely to change rapidly, so by the time you read this, some questions in the article may have been answered in a court case or by a regulatory body somewhere.)\n\n4 Ethical Questions Generative AI Poses\n\nThe scary truth about AI copyright is nobody knows what will happen next\n\nVideos\n\n(Please note much of this is older information)\n\nThe Creative Penn (YouTube): The AI-Augmented Author.

      "# [Sudowrite Review: Is This The Future of Writing? by Dario Villirilli on 2025-01-17](https://blog.reedsy.com/guide/book-writing-software/sudowrite/)\nAs a bit of a purist when it comes to craft, I’m always apprehensive at the thought of AI genuinely helping writers. I don’t believe anyone should use AI to write an entire novel — after all, that would defeat the creative purpose behind storytelling. But I do think that if this new technology can help authors refine their ideas and drafts into polished works, then maybe it shouldn’t be discarded.\n\nSo, I decided to take Sudowrite for a spin and find out more about this popular AI writing tool. Here’s my review.\n\nSudowrite overview and main features\n\nSudowrite is an AI-powered book-writing software for fiction writers. While there are other similar apps, such as Raptor Write and Novelcrafter, Sudowrite is arguably the most popular, as it was one of the first tools to popularize AI in fiction writing with a user-friendly interface.\n\nI tested it with Reedsy's concept novel Rocket Bride, a romantic space opera about a princess who avoids marrying an evil land developer with the help of a roguish smuggler.\n\nHere’s what the editor looks like:\n\nOverall, Sudowrite provides a range of features — from outlining to auto-writing and self-editing — that are designed to help authors overcome writer's block and “elevate their storytelling.”\n\nHere are some of the most important features:\n\nGo from story idea to first draft\n\nWhether you’re starting with a vague story idea or a fully fleshed-out concept, Story Bible helps you outline your characters, worldbuilding, synopsis, plot, and even write your first chapters based on your input. While you can generate all this information about your story with AI, it’s much better to provide as many details as possible yourself. If you let the AI handle it, you’ll end up with a rather bland story concept.\n\nWhat’s great is that you can upload a 2,000-word sample to train the Story Bible on your voice. It will analyze elements like tone, mood, POV, vocabulary, and sentence structure to tailor its suggestions to your unique writing style. For example, after analyzing our sample, it described the writing as “intimate,” “reflective,” and an “exploration of love and choice within a fantastical setting.” It also claimed that my sample has “vivid language” and “natural dialogue.”\n\nLet AI write and rewrite parts of your novel\n\nThe Write function is where the magic happens — or at least, it’s supposed to. You can paste your manuscript into Sudowrite, and whenever you’re working on a chapter and hit a creative roadblock, you can ask the tool to autocomplete it for you. Suggestions will pop up in cards on the right panel, and with just one click, you can review and insert them directly into your manuscript.\n\nSince this is the “heart of the operation,” you can customize your AI settings in depth. For example, you can choose the type of AI model you’d like to work with (e.g., Claude Opus instead of GPT-4o) and adjust the level of prose creativity and quality to suit your needs.\n\nMore importantly, you can guide the AI through the writing process rather than just letting it autocomplete your sentences. You simply type what the next few paragraphs should be about. This approach typically leads to much better results.\n\nThe Rewrite feature works similarly but focuses on reworking selected text rather than generating entirely new content.\n\nGet help in showing rather than telling\n\nAnother interesting feature is Describe, which is quite handy for authors who need help mastering the “show, don’t tell” rule. Simply highlight a sentence and click on it, and you’ll receive suggestions on how to bring your scene to life using the five senses or creative metaphors. I found this to be a valuable source of inspiration, as it can be quite difficult to look at a scene from different perspectives when you’re in the middle of writing.\n\nBrainstorm character ideas and more\n\nThe Brainstorm feature helps you generate ideas for characters, worldbuilding, dialogue, and more. Simply provide a prompt and some context, and it will give you several options to choose from. Once you select an idea, you can save it and access it later in the text editor.\n\nThat said, it doesn’t integrate with the Story Bible, meaning you’ll need to re-enter context if, for example, you want to brainstorm some character names, which can be annoying.\n\nHowever, I think the tool remains useful. For example, for our story, I quite liked the character ideas of Grax, the captain of Princess Ximara's royal guard “who is fiercely loyal to her and will stop at nothing to protect her,” and Lord Zarek, “the cunning and manipulative advisor, who often influences Aether's decisions.”\n\nVisualize your story's outline\n\nCanvas lets you visually map out your outline using one of four popular story structures: the Hero’s Journey, Save the Cat, the Three-Act Structure, or Romancing the Beat. Its flexibility allows you to use it for just about anything, like mapping character relationships. You can drag and drop elements like cards and boxes to organize your ideas however you like.\n\nPlugins\n\nFinally, Sudowrite offers some default Plugins to help you generate plot twists, create images from your story scenes, and receive feedback on your craft. The latter is perhaps the most interesting one: it praises the best part of your work and gives you some tips (or questions to ponder on) for improvement. While it’s no substitute for an actual human editor, it acts as an ever-available beta reader, which is always pretty useful.\n\nThe best part about plugins is the creativity of the writing community — anyone can create and share their own plugins for free on a dedicated page. Some plugins are designed to help you write spicy scenes, some focus on improving your opening lines, and others are made to deliver brutally honest feedback.\n\nFor example, here’s what the Brutally Honest Bot had to say about the pacing of my book’s opening: “The scene feels slow and meandering, lacking a sense of urgency or momentum. There's too much focus on Ximara's internal thoughts and emotions without enough external action to drive the scene forward.” Ouch. But also, rather helpful.\n\nThe text editor\n\nSudowrite also includes a text editor that lets you customize font, line spacing, and theme (offering various dark modes!). While it’s decent, I found it pretty basic compared to Reedsy Studio’s editor, which lets you set writing goals, collaborate with external contributors, add front and back matter, and typeset your manuscript for print. Using Sudowrite's AI features is great, but constantly exporting your work to a proper book-writing tool can interrupt the flow and make the process feel a bit clunky.\n\nSudowrite pricing\n\nBefore I share my thoughts on my overall experience with Sudowrite, let’s talk about pricing. Sudowrite uses a tiered pricing structure. Every subscription grants full access to all of its tools — the only difference between tiers is the amount of AI credits you can use. (The credits you use will depend on the complexity of each request, which is determined by the number of words used/generated and the model you select to process it.)\n\nYour choice will depend on which features you plan to use the most. If you’re primarily looking to use the Story Engine to build your outline or get some self-editing feedback, the Hobby & Student plan should be enough. However, if you intend to write substantial portions of your novel with Sudowrite, the Professional plan would be a better fit. The Max plan only makes sense if you need the additional AI credits!\n\nYou can also avoid using too many credits in Sudowrite by using Gemini, Claude, or ChatGPT on the side for some tasks (e.g., brainstorming some character or worldbuilding ideas).\n\nOne thing I appreciated is Sudowrite’s \"EZ Cancel Guarantee,\" which lets you easily upgrade, downgrade, pause, or cancel your plan. It’s quite refreshing, especially since so many tools these days seem to take the opposite approach, making cancellations frustratingly difficult.\n\nSudowrite pros and cons\n\nThere’s a lot to appreciate about Sudowrite. It combines a modern, user-friendly interface with powerful tools like the Story Bible, Write and Describe features, and all the helpful community-driven plugins. The pricing model is reasonable, catering to writers with varying levels of needs and engagement.\n\nMoreover, consider that AI technology evolves rapidly, and Sudowrite is well-positioned to improve its offerings over time. It seems to have a dedicated team that actively listens to user feedback and rolls out updates and new features.\n\nThat said, it's not all roses.\n\nThe AI suggestions aren’t flawless\n\nThe main idea behind using Sudowrite is to let the AI write parts of your novel or at least offer compelling narrative threads to help you break through creative blocks. While I was impressed with the overall quality, it’s not 100% reliable.\n\nHere’s an example from a scene it generated:\n\nContext: Ximara is reluctantly entering the room at her rehearsal dinner.\n\n“Ximara took a deep breath and stepped forward, her eyes scanning the room for Aether. She spotted him near the center, his tall frame and shock of silver hair unmistakable. As their eyes met, his face broke into a warm smile that made her heart flutter.\n\nShe began to make her way towards him, accepting greetings and well-wishes from the guests with practiced grace. The throbbing in her head intensified with each step, but she pushed through it, focusing on Aether's welcoming smile.”\n\nIt’s polished and functional, but far from final. At best, it serves as a starting point for further tweaking. (To be fair, using the guided Write option does improve the results, as well as giving it a detailed Story Bible.)\n\nThis is the most interesting aspect of AI writing: the ability to help you “look forward” in your plot. Sometimes, these ideas are genuinely exciting and can add fresh energy to your story. However, many other times the suggestions often fall back on clichés, or overly sentimental tones. Worse, they sometimes contradict the Story Bible or earlier parts of the text — whether those were written by you or the AI itself.\n\nThis means you can’t fully trust it. I’ve come to think of AI as a powerful horse — it’ll charge ahead when you ask, but no matter how many guardrails you give it, it won’t necessarily stick to the path you have in mind. You need to actively steer it to keep your story on track, and there are moments when it feels easier to just write the scenes yourself.\n\nThe features can be a bit overwhelming\n\nWhile it’s fantastic to have tools for brainstorming characters, outlining, gathering feedback, and more, there’s a downside: you can end up spending more time tinkering with features (like tweaking the content in the Story Bible) than actually writing or thinking creatively. It can feel like you’re becoming more of a prompt engineer than a writer.\n\nOne way to avoid this is by narrowing down how you use Sudowrite. (For example, I’d mostly use the Story Bible, the guided Write feature, and a few helpful plugins.)\n\nEthical considerations\n\nMany authors have expressed concerns about the ethical implications of using AI for writing novels. Sudowrite has stated that they “do not use your writing to train AI models,” which is reassuring. However, the AI suggestions are powered by a combination of models, including those from Claude and OpenAI, along with Sudowrite’s proprietary models, so it’s unclear exactly what data has been used to train these systems. It’ll be up to you to determine if you’re comfortable with using them.\n\nThe verdict: Should you use Sudowrite?\n\nSudowrite isn’t a one-stop solution for writing a novel, but it can be a very useful companion — especially if you enjoy experimenting with new technologies.\n\nIf you already have a solid grounding in storytelling and plenty of ideas but get stuck when it’s time to draft, Sudowrite can help you outline your plot. Sometimes, having a clear roadmap is all you need to finally start writing.\n\nIt can also be a game-changer for serial authors. Not every book needs to be a groundbreaking literary masterpiece, after all. If your goal is to produce a steady stream of romance or thriller stories that rely on familiar tropes while adding a touch of creativity, for example, then this tool could make you more productive.\n\nIf you are a budding author, you may also enjoy Sudowrite’s “show, don’t tell” suggestions, community plugins, and overall AI-writing features. The key is to use these to enhance your craft rather than letting them replace it.\n\nUltimately, if you’re curious about new technologies and interested in new ways of writing, then check out Sudowrite. While AI won't be able to do the creative heavy lifting for you, it might help you become more productive.",

Let’s check out these tools in detail and see how they can transform your writing process.\n\n1. Story Engine\n\nPlotting a story is one of the toughest challenges for writers. The Story Engine simplifies this by acting like a brainstorming partner. It breaks down your narrative into manageable parts, helping you develop a clear structure. Whether you’re outlining a novel or working on a screenplay, this feature provides:\n\nSuggestions for Story Arcs: Need help crafting a compelling journey for your characters? The Story Engine suggests arcs that resonate with your genre and style.\n\nPacing Tips: Sudowrite ensures your story flows smoothly by identifying slow or rushed sections.\n\nCharacter Development: From protagonist backstories to sidekick motivations, the Story Engine assists in building characters with depth.\n\nIt’s like having a professional editor guide your storytelling while still giving you full creative control.\n\n2. Rewrite Suggestions\n\nLet’s face it: everyone struggles with awkward sentences now and then. The Rewrite Suggestions tool is a lifesaver in such moments. It scans your text for clarity, grammar, and style issues, then offers alternative phrasing that maintains your voice all without hours of manual editing.\n\nFor example:\n\nClunky Sentence: “She ran quickly across the park, her feet pounding on the wet grass.”\n\nRewrite Suggestion: “She sprinted across the park, her footsteps thudding against the damp grass.”\n\n3. Describe Tool\n\nHave you ever stared at a blank page, unsure how to describe a scene or character? The Describe Tool steps in with vivid imagery and sensory details to make your writing pop.\n\nSay you’re describing a sunset. Instead of defaulting to “The sky turned orange and pink,” Sudowrite might suggest:\n\n“The horizon blazed with streaks of fiery orange, melting into soft hues of blush pink, as if the day was bidding a dramatic farewell.”\n\nThis tool is perfect for writers aiming to create immersive worlds, whether in novels, short stories, or even poetry.\n\n4. Brainstorming Assistance\n\nWriter’s block? Sudowrite’s Brainstorming Assistance ensures you’re never out of ideas. It acts as a springboard for creativity, helping you push past mental roadblocks. You can get creative prompts for:\n\nPlot Twists: What if your protagonist discovers a shocking secret?\n\nDialogue Ideas: How would a quirky sidekick respond in a tense situation?\n\nCharacter Traits: Give your villain an unexpected soft spot.\n\n5. Tone Check\n\nTone consistency can make or break a piece of writing. The Tone Check tool ensures your work matches the intended mood throughout. Think of it as a second set of eyes to keep your writing polished and professional.\n\nHow It Works: Sudowrite scans your text for tone shifts and suggests adjustments. For instance, if a formal essay suddenly becomes too casual, it will flag the section and propose edits.\n\nWhy It Matters: This is especially helpful for writers juggling multiple projects with varying tones, like business reports and creative fiction.\n\n6. Beta Reader AI\n\nEvery writer knows the value of feedback, but getting someone to read your work isn’t always easy. That’s where the Beta Reader AI comes in.\n\nWhat It Does: This tool provides detailed feedback on your draft, pointing out:\n\nWhat’s working (e.g., engaging dialogue or strong pacing).\n\nWhat’s unclear (e.g., plot holes or confusing transitions).\n\nAreas for improvement (e.g., underdeveloped characters or flat descriptions).\n\nHow It Feels: Unlike human beta readers who might take weeks, Sudowrite delivers instant insights. It’s constructive and objective, giving you the tools to elevate your writing without sugarcoating.\n\nFeature Comparison Table\n\nHow to Use Sudowrite\n\nGetting started with Sudowrite is straightforward.

      "# [I tried Sudowrite to overcome writer’s block — and I finally finished my novel by Amanda Caswell on 2024-09-04](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/i-tried-sudowrite-to-overcome-writer-s-block-and-i-finally-finished-my-novel)\nWhen I first heard about Sudowrite, I was intrigued but skeptical. The AI writing platform uses over two dozen AI models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude 2 by Anthropic, multiple open models, and transformer models created by OpenAI.\n\nThe result? Your writing gets a human-like narrative that's impressively good. After diving in, I can confidently say it has exceeded my expectations in many ways.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at how Sudowrite helps bring stories to life.\n\nMy first impressions\n\nUpon opening Sudowrite, I was greeted with a clean and intuitive interface, which meant I didn't have to spend hours figuring out how to use it. After watching a quick video, within minutes, I was ready to explore its three main modes: Describe, Brainstorm, and Rewrite.\n\nStarting a new project in Sudowrite is straightforward. I recommend enabling the Story Bible feature, where you can input all the details about your novel, including your outline, synopsis, and characters.\n\nOne of my favorite features is style. Simply input a sample paragraph, and AI will analyze and match your writing style. I included a paragraph of my own writing and even added that I wanted a structure similar to that of Beverly Cleary. Surprise – Sudowrite delivered!\n\nHow Sudowrite helps you write\n\nThe Describe Mode is where Sudowrite truly shines. I often struggle to paint vivid pictures with my words, but this mode changed the game for me.\n\nBy inputting a few keywords or a simple sentence, Sudowrite generated detailed descriptions that added depth and richness to my writing. It felt like having a personal creative assistant who could effortlessly expand on my ideas.\n\nNext, I tried the Brainstorm Mode. As someone who occasionally hits creative roadblocks, this feature was a lifesaver.\n\nI fed it a basic concept, and Sudowrite presented me with a plethora of directions to take my story, which I then turned into beats for each chapter.\n\nIt was like having a brainstorming session with a highly imaginative friend who never runs out of ideas.\n\nOther features\n\nIn less than a minute, AI weaves together your beats to seamlessly generate a chapter. Be sure to keep the application open. Switching tabs might cause glitches. Once the chapter is created, you can go in and make any necessary edits or move on to the next chapter.\n\nSudowrite offers fun plugins to keep you motivated. Some of my favorites are the Simulated New Yorker Review, Encouraging Writing Buddy, Brainstorm, and Feedback. If you’re a glutton for punishment, you might enjoy the Hyper Critical Writing Buddy and Brutal Honesty Bot (personally, I avoid those at all costs).\n\nFinally, the Rewrite Mode helped me refine my drafts. It suggested alternative phrasings and sentence structures, making my writing flow better and read more smoothly. This mode is perfect for those final touches before hitting ‘publish’ or submitting a manuscript.\n\nPerformance and pricing\n\nNow, let’s talk about the elephant in the room: pricing. Sudowrite’s subscription plans are on the higher side, which might be a dealbreaker for some. However, considering the productivity boost and creative inspiration it provided me, I found it worth the investment.\n\nIf you’re serious about writing and can afford it, Sudowrite is a valuable tool. You can give it a test drive for free, but if you’re serious about your writing, subscriptions start at $10/month. Trust me, it’s worth it.\n\nWhile Sudowrite impressed me overall, it wasn’t without flaws. I’ve had it change a character’s name mid-story and transform another’s curly hair into a spiky hairdo for no reason. The AI generated content was generally coherent and contextually appropriate, but there were moments when the output felt a bit off. These instances required some manual tweaking, reminding me that AI still can’t completely replace the human touch.\n\nOne of the unexpected perks of Sudowrite is its strong community. The developers actively engage with users, regularly updating the platform based on feedback. Customer support is also top-notch, ensuring that any issues or questions are promptly addressed.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nSudowrite has genuinely transformed my approach to writing. Six months ago, if you had told me I’d complete not one, but two YA science fiction novels, I would have laughed.\n\nIf you’d told me one of those novels would hit #1 on Amazon for a week, I’d have begged for the secret.\n\nSudowrite isn’t just a tool; it’s a creative companion that can help unlock your writing potential. Give it a try, and you might just find yourself finally writing that novel.\n\nMore from Tom's Guide",
      "# [5+ Generative AI Writing Tools Everyone Should Know About by Bernard Marr on 2024-03-06](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/03/06/5-generative-ai-writing-tools-everyone-should-know-about/)\nOne of the most popular use cases for generative AI is writing. This is thanks to the ability of tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to create any kind of text, from poetry and fiction to technical documents.\n\nTheir ability to understand context and mimic any human writing style in order to create comprehensive content on any subject is probably their most impressive ability right now.\n\nIt's worth remembering, however, that these large language model (LLM) tools are, for the most part, limited to constructing text based on their training data. This means it isn't necessarily great at communicating new ideas or writing in a way that will grip the attention of a human audience.\n\nBut when it comes to brainstorming, drafting, structuring, researching and fact-checking, it can be a powerful tool that can save time and effort for anyone who needs to create written content.\n\nIt can also speed up all manner of routine, day-to-day writing, such as drafting emails or creating product descriptions for e-commerce businesses.\n\nFive Of My Favorite Generative AI Writing Tools\n\nThe most well-known generative AI tools are all capable of creating written text. But here, I'm focusing on those that specifically provide features and functions designed to assist with writing. These are some of the most useful and interesting players on the field right now:\n\nJasper\n\nJasper was one of the first specialist generative AI writing tools, positioning itself as a solution for marketers needing to create copy in a hurry. It provides templates that speed up the process of generating blogs, social media posts or product listings.\n\nThis gives it an advantage over more general-purpose genAI tools that often start you off on a blank page and require careful prompting if you want them to follow a process to create multiple pieces of writing. It also adapts to its user's style and voice over time.\n\nAnother advantage over general-purpose tools (like ChatGPT) is that Jasper doesn't rely on any one language model. While its output is powered by OpenAI’s models, including GPT-4, it is also reported to use models created by Google, Anthropic and more. Jasper isn’t the cheapest option on the market, but it stands out by providing a tailored set of solutions for marketing-focused writers.\n\nSudowrite\n\nOne thing that sets Sudowrite apart is that it is tailored specifically for fiction writers. So, if you’re looking for an AI that might help you write the next Game Of Thrones, it could be the right choice for you!\n\nSudowrite is built around tools that can help fiction authors, such as brainstorming aids, restructuring sentences to make them more readable or exciting, and providing detailed feedback on their own writing. It is designed to understand concepts such as audiences and genres, as well as what makes a piece of writing engaging for an audience to read. Not sure where your story’s going? Simply hit the Write button and have it continue the tale, giving you options to choose from and mimicking your own tone and voice!\n\nAnyword\n\nAnyword is focused on what it calls \"performance content,\" content designed to sell, generate clicks or encourage audiences to take some other form of action.\n\nIt includes a “predicted performance” stat that attempts to forecast how well your piece of content will go down with your audience. The aim is to automate the data analytics that marketers use when creating and publishing content at the point of writing in order to encourage greater engagement.\n\nUnlike some of the other options here, this is marketed firmly as a business solution and isn't the best choice for hobby writers or those starting a small business marketing strategy from scratch. It’s accessed via an API rather than a friendly chatbot web interface.\n\nBut for established companies who have plenty of data and an established content pipeline that want to start leveraging AI-driven analytics, it’s a good option.\n\nCanva Magic Write\n\nOkay, so this one isn't a standalone writing tool. It’s the writing element of the versatile cloud-based design platform Canva that has recently added a ton of AI functionality under the heading Magic.\n\nAs you might expect, this one is mostly geared toward writing as an element of design rather than creating plain, long-form text. This means it's optimized for creating marketing emails, social media ads and advertising copy. I particularly like the way it lets you adjust the tone of your text. This is stuff that you’d need to dive into prompt engineering in order to do if you’re relying on something like ChatGPT or Gemini to write marketing copy. One of the differences when using a specialized platform is that this kind of use case-specific function is built into the user interface, so it's always at your fingertips.\n\nGrammarly\n\nGrammarly has been around for a long time and has always been marketed as an AI typing assistant. But a major overhaul last year saw the introduction of Grammarly GO, its generative AI-augmented service. Currently still in beta but available to most users, GO uses large language algorithms to provide content suggestions and synonyms and to suggest better ways of saying what you want to say.\n\nIt isn’t a standalone tool that will churn out long-form content on its own, but rather a plugin that can be integrated into software from word processors to web browsers – anywhere you might want to write text. It also scores your text for readability, detects plagiarism and gives automated guidance on word choice and sentence structure. It may not get mentioned in so many news reports as newer players like ChatGPT or Google Gemini, but as an all-around writing assistant for the sort of writing that most people do every day, it's hard to beat.\n\nOther Great Generative AI Writing Tools\n\nThere are many other apps, tools and platforms that also specialize in writing, so here’s a quick overview of the rest!\n\nAI Writer\n\nWrites content like blog posts while citing its sources to help overcome issues of AI hallucination.\n\nChibi\n\nChibi aims to give users deeper control over the AI writing process, creating personalized workflows rather than relying on templates.\n\nContent At Scale\n\nGeared for creating human-like written content for marketing purposes.\n\nCopy.ai\n\nContent creation tool aimed at businesses and enterprises, with built-in templates for common jobs.\n\nCopymatic\n\nAI copywriting tool that specializes in website copy, blogs and social media posts for businesses or hobbyists.\n\nCopysmith\n\nCopysmith’s Describely tool is a very useful application optimized for using AI to write product descriptions for e-commerce.\n\nFraze\n\nThis one provides feedback on grammar and clarity of your writing, and also optimizes copy for SEO purposes.\n\nFriday\n\nA collaborative writing assistant focused on simplifying content production with tools for brainstorming as well as templates.\n\nHemingway\n\nDesigned to help writers create clear, concise and to-the-point writing in an active voice, much like Hemmingway himself.\n\nHyperWrite\n\nWriting assistant with a comprehensive toolbox of AI features to help tackle a variety of writing tasks.\n\nInk\n\nAuto-generate SEO-optimized content to improve ranking in search engines.\n\nLex\n\nAn AI co-pilot for writers offering AI feedback on your work and tools for finding the right words or expressions or generating ideas.\n\nLongshot\n\nCreate more long-form content that differentiates by promising zero hallucinations.\n\nNovelAI\n\nDesigned to help would-be novelists get their ideas out of their heads and onto the page.\n\nOutwrite\n\nAnother extension-based assistant that plugs into your favorite software and offers in-line automated assistance as you work.\n\nProWritingAid\n\nA writing mentor for professionals, offering in-depth analysis of style and readability with the aim of creating elegant prose.\n\nQuillbot\n\nQuillbot bills itself as a paraphraser tool to help writers find a better way of phrasing something.\n\nRytr\n\nGenerates blogs, emails, social media posts, SEO headlines and ads.\n\nScribe\n\nAutomates the creation of documentation, step-by-step and how-to guides.\n\nSEO.AI\n\nThis one focuses on streamlining and automating SEO-related tasks, cutting down the need for manual keyword research.\n\nTextmetrics\n\nProvides feedback on grammar, style and clarity in order to improve the user’s writing.\n\nTextio\n\nTextio is an AI writing assistant specifically designed for HR writing, automating the process of creating performance feedback and assessments.\n\nWordtune\n\nGenerative writing assistant aimed at professionals.\n\nWriter\n\nThis one uses an open-source LLM that has only been trained on freely distributable writing data in order to avoid copyright infringement issues.\n\nWriteSonic\n\nGeared towards creating SEO content and traffic-boosting copy.",
      "# [From Fiction to Reality: AI-assisted Creative Writing by Raza Habib on 2024-09-10](https://humanloop.com/blog/ai-assisted-creative-writing)\nIn this episode, we dive deep into the world of AI-assisted creative writing with James Yu, founder of Sudowrite. James shares the journey of building an AI assistant for novelists, helping writers develop ideas, manage complex storylines, and avoid clichés. James gets into the backlash the company faced when they first released Story Engine and how they're working to build a community of users.\n\nSubscribe to Humanloop’s new podcast, High Agency, on YouTube, Spotify, or Apple Podcasts\n\nTranscript\n\nChapters\n\n00:00 - Introduction and Background of Sudowrite\n\n02:26 - The Early Days: Concept, Skepticism, and User Adoption\n\n05:20 - Sudowrite's Interface, Features, and User Base\n\n10:23 - Developing and Iterating Features in Sudowrite\n\n17:29 - The Evolution of Story Bible and Writing Assistance\n\n24:27 - Challenges in Maintaining Coherence and AI-Assisted Writing\n\n29:12 - Evaluating AI Features and the Role of Prompt Engineering\n\n33:35 - Handling Tropes, Clichés, and Fine-Tuning for Author Voice\n\n40:43 - The Controversy and Future of AI in Creative Work\n\n51:37 - Predictions for AI in the Next Five Years\n\n49:54 - Closing Thoughts\n\nPodcast:\n\n[00:00:00] James Yu: I think that even though Da Vinci could go off the rails, we leaned into that as a strong suit because hallucinations in that world, in fiction, can be good. We actually couched it as the wormhole feature because I think domain expertise is what is necessary to bring something from a cool Twitter demo into something relevant. So, I think it is a big shift, and I understand the kind of fear that is around there, like, \"Is it going to take my job? Is it going to be trained on my works?\" I do believe that authors should get compensation.\n\n[00:00:33] Raza Habib: This is High Agency, the podcast for AI builders. I'm Raza Habib, and I’m really excited today to be chatting with James Yu, who's the founder of Sudowrite and also a serial entrepreneur, having previously founded and sold Pulse and been an engineer. I've actually been looking forward to chatting with James for a while now because I think Sudowrite is a pretty unusual AI company. They’ve built a writing assistant for creative writing and for fiction authors. And also, because I think James is unusually thoughtful in how to build with LLMs, and as I think, like, discovered a lot of the best practices for himself. James, it’s a pleasure to have you on the show.\n\n[00:01:17] James Yu: Yeah, happy to be here and talk with you, Raza.\n\n[00:01:19] Raza Habib: Fantastic, James. To start with, for our audience, who are mostly people who are themselves trying to build AI products, can you just describe a little bit of what Sudowrite is and the current stage of the company?\n\n[00:01:23] James Yu: Yeah, so Sudowrite is an AI assistant for novelists, and long-form storytellers is our sweet spot. How I usually describe this to people is that most writers, 99.99% of writers, do not have a writer's room like in Hollywood. That is a very rare thing, and so you could kind of think about Sudowrite as that writer's room for you as a creative writer. So, we're very focused on using AI as a point of inspiration to help get you unblocked when you're writing a story, specifically.\n\n[00:01:58] Raza Habib: So, I remember when I first heard about this idea, like, the first time you and I interacted, which I guess must have been, like, 2022 now, so some time ago, and I was, like, immediately skeptical that this is something that writers would want. It was, like, a really counterintuitive product to me. Like, who are the people who are using this and what has their response been? You know, like, why was my intuition wrong? Like, I thought that people who are creative writers would kind of balk at the idea of an AI writing for them or helping them.\n\n[00:02:26] James Yu: Yeah, it's been interesting. Well, I mean, I think one aspect is that Sudowrite was really born out of our own needs. So, my co-founder, Amit, and I, we were actually part of a writing group called Sudowriters. So, that was the origin of the name, and we named it that because we were sort of tech-adjacent folks who were trying to break into fiction, really critiquing each other’s stories, getting different ideas. So, when GPT-3 came out, I started playing with it. It really helped unblock me specifically. So, it really came from that lived experience, seeing how an AI could reflect back on my story. And you know, as a story writer, you're going to get blocked. You're going to hit these roadblocks where you don't know how to finish a story. You need some inspiration. You go for a walk, talk to your friends, and I found, I personally found, that AI was another tool in that toolset to be able to help you get unblocked. So, I sort of saw it as a pair with the craft of fiction, which you still need. The craft of fiction, it's not, you know, it's not magic. You still have to put in the work, but it is another voice that you can consult with. And yeah, how this sort of spread was really word of mouth, right? In the beginning years, we didn't really see this as a sort of high-growth startup. In that way, we really saw it as a toy for ourselves and just talked to other writers' groups who were receptive to the idea of including AI, and it sort of just grew from there. And even in the beginning, we didn’t charge for it for a while, or maybe charged like five bucks a month. But what we really found is that there are certain classes of writers who are interested in using language models in that process. That being said, it's pretty nascent. I think that it is maybe more common to see AI being employed in emails or other enterprise kinds of applications. I think it's still relatively new to the literary world and screenwriting world and sort of creative writing. I do slowly see that changing in the same way that people are using, you know, things like Grammarly, or things like grammar check, spell check, and other kinds of tools. So, I do see this as a long-term journey for us.\n\n[00:04:53] Raza Habib: It’s part of why I wanted to speak to you because I think so many of the initial applications of AI have been very useful but practical, mundane, focused on automating mundane tasks. And this is one of the few examples I’ve seen of a product that really is enhancing people's, like, normal creative abilities. You know, it’s something that I didn’t even think was possible. I saw you guys do it. Do you mind sharing a little bit about the numbers? Like, how many people are using this now? Like, what’s the scale of Sudowrite today?\n\n[00:05:20] James Yu: Yeah, sure thing. So, we have over 15,000 paying members. I would say the vast majority of them are novelists. And these kinds of novelists range—some of them are self-published, some of them have more of a traditional path with agents, some of them are writing multiple books a year, and some of them are writing, you know, maybe one book every four years. Yeah, it's been kind of a journey, really word of mouth over the past four years. So, we’ve been around since 2020 from that seed, but it's definitely now to a point where it is a sustainable business for us so that we can continue to focus on growing to more novelists as well. Screenwriters are sort of a secondary audience that we do see a lot of growth in as well.\n\n[00:06:06] Raza Habib: You know, we're an audio podcast. Can you describe the interface of Sudowrite for someone who hasn’t seen it? I actually think it’s pretty innovative how you guys have set it up. So, you know, if I open up the Sudowrite editor, like, what am I seeing on my screen?\n\n[00:06:16] James Yu: So, basically, you see a text editing program, just like Google Docs. So, that is really the primal interface. We are not a chat; it's not like a chat program, like ChatGPT. You are working with your manuscript, but then at the top bar, you have various AI functions. Some could help you ideate how you would continue the story. Others could help you try to describe things in your story with more lush language or rewrite it. So that's the principal way that people interact with this. So, you’re writing, and you occasionally use some of these functions to help you when you get stuck. But we also have something called Story Bible, and this is something we introduced last year, where it is really a database, essentially, for a story writer to keep track of all the things that are important to your novel in a way that can inform our AI about the various elements, like characters or elements in your world-building, like cities, towns. So, these can be kept up to date by the author, or it can also be analyzed as well when you import your work-in-progress novel. So, we see this as a very crucial piece of the puzzle because it's sort of the liaison between the unstructured prose of your novel, which could be 100,000 words, and the structured ideas and elements that are in your story. It’s best to communicate the AI through this interface we call Story Bible.\n\n[00:07:44] Raza Habib: There are almost like two different paradigms for interacting with the AI then in Sudowrite. So, one is this kind of AI, for want of a better word, co-pilot, which has become kind of the name for these things now, that's kind of sitting over your shoulder. It's watching as you write, and you can ask it to add color, to rewrite things, to extend stuff, to kind of help you as a critic. And then separately, there's this, like, separate, bigger piece, Story Bible, that is allowing me to build up a coherent long-term context of the characters and the background and the city. Is that a fair summary?\n\n[00:08:14] James Yu: Yeah, that's a pretty fair summary. We do see Story Bible as the backbone for a lot of these functions. So, even when you're using, like, a small rewrite of this particular paragraph, we may be bringing in salient elements of StoryBible into the inference as well. So in that way, it is similar to RAG in that way. But, you know, Story Bible is kind of like RAG. We are doing also RAG across kind of the prose, but we also see Story Bible as part of that system. So underneath the hood, we developed something called a saliency engine, which allows us to figure out which parts are salient or not. That being said, we do tell the authors to meet us in the middle, because even with today's advanced language models, writing a novel is still quite an undertaking and a very, very intense process that humans should definitely be in the middle of. So, for example, an affordance that we have in Story Bible is the ability to say, always show this element or hide this element from the AI for now. This is useful, for example, if you have secrets in your story that shouldn't show up until later. We would love to have people do those kinds of things automatically, but we're not quite there yet, and we know that. So, that's something that we inform our community about, like how to tweak these knobs and things like that. So in that way, I almost think of Story Bible paired with the inference in our system like a music sequencer. Maybe you need to mute these drums now, or maybe you need to enhance, you know, the wind section over here. Why not be able to also think about that when you're writing a story or a novel that progresses through time? Because that is the other crucial element. There’s a very big time aspect to writing a story. For now, like, yeah, the user, the writer, is meeting us in the middle. I suspect, you know, as time goes on, and these language models get even better, they won't necessarily have to meet us in the middle. But, you know, one thing is our writers do enjoy writing, and they are using this as an instrument that is highly adaptive to their style. That's why a lot of people choose Sudowrite today.\n\n[00:10:23] Raza Habib: Hopefully, we've given the listeners now a fair picture of what Sudowrite is, how many people are using it, and the fact that it's a really powerful creative tool. So, what I'd love to turn our attention to for a little bit is actually, like, how you build it, because I think you guys have a particularly interesting take to this, and I want to dig in deep on, like, how you guys do prompt engineering and how you figure things out. But also, given, you know, the length of a novel and the coherence that needs to be maintained, and the Story Bible, like, it's a complicated thing to figure out: how do I actually use LLMs to help someone write a novel? So, can we maybe start off with where you started? Like, what were the earliest features that you built into Sudowrite? And then work our way up to how you get the full complexity of Story Bible to work?\n\n[00:11:11] James Yu: Yeah, so when we started in 2020, this was literally the first edition of GPT-3. It was the Da Vinci model, which I still have soft spots for, because I think that even though Da Vinci could go off the rails, we leaned into that as a strong suit for us because hallucinations in that world—in fiction—can be good. What we developed early on was literally just giving authors this kind of completion technology, right? And we actually couched it as the wormhole feature. So, how wormhole, how we communicated it to the author is that, “Hey, when you hit this wormhole button and it gives you suggestions for what might come next in the paragraph, this is other copies of you in other universes that are making different choices in the multiverse. Take it or leave it. Maybe this suggestion from multiverse 2763 is a great option. Maybe it sucks, right?” So, it was very crucial for us to set that expectation because even though GPT-3 was a big jump in quality versus GPT-2, you still had to take things with a grain of salt. But even at that very nascent state, we found that it was a killer feature. Right when you were stuck, you needed different voices and different kinds of ideas on the table. So that was really the first version of Sudowrite—our very baby step.\n\n[00:12:37] Raza Habib: That version, if I imagine how it's working, is really just passing the LLM the previous paragraph of text and saying, \"What comes next?\" Basically, yes? So, MVP Sudowrite is kind of nicely wrapped GPT-3, and then what came next?\n\n[00:12:53] James Yu: Yeah, so we, you know, as the language models became more powerful and had longer context windows, and became more coherent, we added a lot of features that we felt could be delivered with quality, right? That the expectation is met. So, for example, the next feature we had was: \"Oh, highlight a word, let’s say in the scene, like highlight a character, and say 'describe them,' you know, and we describe them using the five senses—taste, smell.\" So, a lot of these things are about trying to get a very evocative scene, which is one of the pillars of writing great prose. We found even Da Vinci was pretty good at doing that, giving you suggestions for different world-building elements like characters. And once again, all of these were in the very, like, card-like interface, which gives you many different options, right? Because at that time, it still goes back to hallucinations and going off the rails. Maybe, let’s say, two out of the five cards would go off the rails.\n\n[00:13:49] Raza Habib: When you say card-like interface, if I recall correctly, the way this works is like, I click \"rewrite\" or I click \"describe,\" and then there’s a kind of sidebar where I get multiple generations, and I can choose to add them into the editor and they’re kind of appearing on the side?\n\n[00:14:03] James Yu: Yep, so it would not auto-insert. That was actually one of the pillars of early Sudowrite as well. We didn’t feel like the language models had the confidence for people to just be like, “Okay, this is going to be great prose, and it’s going to just insert into your manuscript.” But we also saw, as part of the artistic process, that you are looking at this as a pastiche on the right bar—different ideas and options—and then also felt like lower stakes because it’s not being inserted directly. It’s like, “Take it or leave it” again, or ignore those cards very easily. And if some of the options were bad, well, you know, a lot of people see bad options and say, “Oh, you know what? That makes me think of an even better option,” and they never even use the content in those cards, right? So, this kind of negative space aspect to language models as well, because bad ideas are sometimes good in a way that makes your own brain think of a better idea. And so we leaned into that for a while. Even today, we still operate a lot on this card methodology, where we are showing you an array of options, and it’s all about control—giving the author control of how they want to use that content.\n\n[00:15:13] Raza Habib: And something that I recall from when you showed this when you were first building it is that you were very deliberate and considered in figuring out how to make those features good. Do you mind explaining a little bit of your process for how you guys develop the prompts and how you sort of take the 1.0 version of the feature and actually get it to the point where 15,000 writers are wanting to use it?\n\n[00:15:33] James Yu: Yeah, so that’s evolved a lot over the past four years. I would say in the very beginning, it was really human evaluation from me, my co-founder, our team, and also our community. And, you know, that got us actually pretty far in doing that in the early days. But then we also added this aspect of looking at positive actions taken after a card was produced for the user. So, for example, if they decide to insert that card or they decide to copy and paste some content from that card, those are positive intents by the user, and we would take that into account when, let’s say, we’re improving the wormhole button or the describe button. Maybe we improve the prompt somehow. Maybe we inject other, you know, context stuffing, or some other technique. We tend to use that as more like downside protection. I would say, like, “It’s not colossally bad; like, this didn’t reduce the quality a lot.” In terms of the upside, we definitely do quite a mix of qualitative and quantitative measurements. Today, with 15,000 members, we lean also heavily on the community for this. We beta test a lot of our features and measure things like, \"Oh, are they using it more often?\" So, retentive kinds of measurements—are they using it as a replacement for the older version of the function more often? Sometimes we will show them side by side. So, various different techniques to really get at that positive intent from users, to try to get a sense of whether people are actually using this feature. One thing I’ve discovered is that something that goes viral on Twitter in terms of some AI demo doesn’t necessarilymean that people are going to use it day in and day out for their workflow. So we really want to see that kind of retentive use of our function.\n\n[00:17:29] Raza Habib: So is your workflow quite experimental? Are you putting out a lot more features than stick around? Like, what's the process?\n\n[00:17:35] James Yu: So it varies. For example, Story Bible really was an experiment. I built that as a prototype of what could be possible with GPT-4, essentially. And it was really that step function where we saw that, wow, it’s much more coherent now. It is able to remember things better, take into account the context. So that was a huge unlock. But even that took many months of experimenting and tinkering, and a long beta process where we even built that as a separate surface on our app, separate from the main editor. So I would say that was a very intensive experimental phase that lasted months.\n\n[00:18:15] Raza Habib: And during that experimental phase, what are you iterating on? What are the variables or the levers you're pulling to try and make it better?\n\n[00:18:22] James Yu: Yeah, so a lot of that was tweaking the prompts, tweaking the temperature, the various parameters. But that’s also in concert with looking at how users actually use the system, right? To give a bit more context, the Story Bible workflow is very different than, for example, just \"describe.\" \"Describe\" is like you highlight a piece of text, and then it gives you some options. Story Bible, meanwhile, starts with a brain dump of what your story could be, and it helps you flesh out a synopsis from that. And from a synopsis, it helps you flesh out an outline. You can edit that, you can rewrite it, and from there, you can start fleshing out each chapter of your book. So this was not just one single prompt, but I would say it’s a prompt system, and there’s also almost like a model system as well, because some of these were multi-chained prompts that involved different models. I think at the time, mostly GPT-3, but today we also use lots of open-source and Anthropic models as well. So the complexity was 10x, right? So in that world, really, it was both an educational problem for the community, like how do we educate people to use the system in an effective way, while also measuring, like, “Oh, are people thumbs-upping the output? Are people keeping the output and being like, 'Okay, I’m going to copy-paste this into my manuscript now because it was really good?’” Only one in, you know, one. What is the quality bar for that? Well, some of that was quantitative. It was like, \"Okay, is the thumbs-up rate good or not?\" But a lot of that was also just a gut feel, seeing the excitement in Discord, seeing how people were now telling their friends about it, like, “You should get into this beta program for Story Bible.\" “Oh, it’s a limited beta. I wish you guys could expand it even more.” Right? So we also do a big community temperature check on a lot of the features that we’re building. If there’s no excitement around it, usually it's kind of a negative signal. And if people are not using it, that's also a negative signal as well. So we take a lot of these kinds of signals coming in. Story Bible is the most involved. For our smaller functions that we iterate on, maybe it is... we just take some quantitative signals from an A/B test, and we use a tool called GrowthBook for doing some of the testing there. Of course, we also use HumanLoop as well for the evals and also for iterating prompts. So, we're not very wedded to one kind of technique, because I think each and every function is used differently, and different judgment calls are needed for each of them.\n\n[00:20:57] Raza Habib: Can you tell us how Story Bible works? You know, the original features like rewrite, describe, etc., I kind of intuitively understand how one might build that. But how do you even begin to go about building something like Story Bible that needs to help me write an entire novel? And also, when you launched it, the context windows were a lot shorter. So, to what extent are you using one context? Like, what techniques are you using? How do I make it work?\n\n[00:21:17] James Yu: For Story Bible, I sort of sat down and thought about how I think about writing a long-form story. There are many ways into that, but one way into that is something called the snowflake method, which is, you start with broad strokes of the entire story that could be encapsulated in a very small amount of synopsis. Say it’s just a few paragraphs or so. From there, you expand each paragraph into, you know, a larger one-pager. From there, you expand each one-pager into a chapter. And if you keep doing this fractally, essentially, you would get a coherent story and a whole novel as well. So, this was a methodology, I believe, created by a software engineer who turned writer. He espoused the snowflake method. Now, Story Bible wasn’t precisely this method, but it was in the same thrust where I sat down and thought about, “Wait, what is the problem with the context window?” Because at the time, yeah, the context windows were small, and how could you possibly generate 100,000 words for a novel from that if your aim was to write a zero draft, for example, using a language model? Well, this sort of expansion technique with the human in the loop would allow the language model to be able to go much farther there. So, I basically built a prototype, which was one box, I think it was like six boxes next to each other, and it started out from the very high level, all the way down to each chapter. And then essentially, the user is working left to right and imbuing more and more detail and more and more length along the way. And so this was the crux. This allowed the language model to be able to work in sizable chunks that it could handle. And one crucial thing we ran into along the way was, going from a scene—a description of a scene, let’s say, for a chapter—and going from a paragraph, how do you have a language model write 4,000 words based on that small description? A junior writer, for example, a human junior writer, could probably do that pretty well with good literary knowledge. So, in cases like that, we added a step in the middle. For example, you can't just go from the scene description to the full chapter. You have to write scene beats. So, basically, an ordered list of step-by-step actions that happen in that scene. This was not actually intuitive to literary writers in the beginning, because now they think it’s just like, “Well, yeah, you just write the whole scene, right from top to bottom.” But we found that it was very effective to have the writer break down, “Okay, what are the beats of this scene? Give me 12 bullet points.” Then, we would have this chunking technique that would allow the AI to then be like, “Oh yeah, okay, I’m working on these two or three elements within this scene. I have the context of some of the previous ones, but I could just focus.” Right? So it’s really about having the human break down all the constituent parts of the novel-writing process into chunks that the AI could be able to handle.\n\n[00:24:27] Raza Habib: And how do you ensure coherence across the book? Right? Like, presumably, a character gets mentioned in chapter one and they're doing something, and then in chapter 11, everything still needs to be consistent. That feels like it would be quite hard to do, maybe easier now with long context, but still non-trivial. How do you guys overcome that?\n\n[00:24:45] James Yu: This is something we’re still trying to overcome. Okay, it is a tough problem. You know, as I said before, right now, we are really having the author meet us in the middle. So they are giving the context in Story Bible. Something that we’re actively working on right now is adding a timeline element to Story Bible. How I think about this problem is world modeling, essentially. If you were to do this full force, you would have a timeline going from the beginning of the novel all the way to the end, and then state variables for every single element, and obviously every character, but also like, where they are, scene settings, and once you have that model, you can imagine a system that would be able to provide whatever’s salient to that scene to be able to write it. So, J.K. Rowling actually is very famous for being this type of writer, in that she keeps a very detailed spreadsheet of all the characters in Harry Potter for every scene. What are the characters doing in that scene? But what are the characters that are off-scene doing as well? So, her mind kind of works in this way. So, I see Story Bible in this sort of what we’re trying to reach for, to be able to get to that state. Now, I think that to ask a human to write all of that is very onerous, and no one’s going to do that, except for maybe J.K. Rowling. So we’re currently employing things to be able to fill that out, right, to be able to essentially simulate this novel world for the purposes of writing this particular chapter or scene, or to make this description more evocative. We're not there yet. I mean, I think we're in the middle of that journey of essentially making this model that will help the AI understand the story better. Now, you also mentioned long context windows. Obviously, you could just put the entire novel into, you know, the long-context Gemini or the longer-context Anthropic stuff. Obviously, there are some cost concerns there, like, do you really want to pay seven bucks to help with this one paragraph? Maybe, maybe it’s a very crucial paragraph, but I think that might be the wrong tool. I think that might need to be paired with a system that understands logically what’s happening in this thing.\n\n[00:27:33] Raza Habib: When you talk to the writers about their interaction with the system, when you're talking to your kind of users and customers, how do they describe their interaction with AI? Do they describe it as, like, being an assistant? Do they view it as a co-creator? Do they still view it as a tool? Like, what is the metaphor that they are using when they’re thinking about what Sudowrite is to them?\n\n[00:27:33] James Yu: Yeah, that varies a lot. And the reason it varies is that it's still very nascent, and people are still trying to figure out how they’re interacting with these systems. So, I would say it’s all of the above, but there are definitely people who are like, “Oh yeah, I use it strategically for these kinds of places where I need help in my manuscript,” all the way up to people who are like, “Oh yeah, it's a co-creator. I have a particular template I use for my romance novel. My readers know what they want, and they actually know that AI is involved in helping craft this story. I have a particular outline template, and I use this to write my zero draft, and then I go in and edit everything.” So it really spans the gamut. There’s also a lot of people who just use it as a reflective tool. In the early days, we heard from users that this made them feel less lonely because, as you might know, novel writing is a pretty lonely affair for most people. Most novelists are lone wolves. Maybe they have a writing group, maybe not. I mean, I think that’s still almost a pretty privileged position to be in. And sometimes their partner won't even read their manuscript if they’re sick of it. So, we definitely heard reports that, like, “Oh, at least Sudowrite will read my stuff and also be positive and be like, ‘Here are some ways to be able to improve it.’” So, we definitely hear that. In some ways, we might also age into a little bit of a wellness kind of—or coach, writing coach, or AI writing editor. I hesitate to fully characterize it as such, because I think that, you know, ultimately, the human really is the editor. But we definitely have shades of that where they are anthropomorphizing the AI as being that co-creator.\n\n[00:29:12] Raza Habib: I took a slight tangent. I want to close the lid on kind of the actual practical nuts and bolts of building this thing. One big question that has been on my mind is just, how do you do evaluation overall? Like, how are you measuring? You’ve mentioned hints of this around the place, but what’s the process for when you launch a new feature? Or, because it feels very subjective, feels like it’s hard to measure. Especially once you’re generating something the length of a novel, then actually even reading the output might be something that takes a lot of time, let alone generating multiple versions and scoring them in some way or trying to check for consistency. So, what is literally the nuts-and-bolts way that you guys measure performance today?\n\n[00:29:49] James Yu: Yeah, so we do use some LLM evaluation, and those are mostly guardrails. For example, we have a coherency metric. So, in Story Bible, let’s say that you have these scene beats, and then you generate 400 words of prose from that. So, we have an evaluator, I think we’re using maybe GPT-4 or OpenAI, or maybe Haiku or something like that. And then we’re using that to basically inspect the output and be like, “Okay, did it actually hit those scene beats? Was that accurate in that sense?” So nothing about creativity; it’s more like guardrails of, yeah, “Is it following the instructions?” So, we have a whole bevy of these—about a dozen different metrics that we use. Another example is, \"Are the characters that are mentioned in this prose actually the characters that were in Story Bible? And if so, are they accurately named? Are they doing anything that’s out of character with them?\" All the way down to even lower-level things like, “Are there repeating paragraphs in this scene?” Because a lot of times, LLMs tend to repeat themselves internally. We call this the demon of repetition because it happens a lot. So, we have, like, “How do we vanquish repetition?” So we have a metric for that as well, trying not to repeat beats that we had already written for. So, we don't run these evals all the time. We will do them strategically when, for example, we’re developing a new function or we’re doing a vast improvement to an existing function as well. The other thing is just, yeah, human evaluations, and that’s through beta testing and getting their feedback and having them thumbs-up or thumbs-down. We will also look through those thumbs-downs, especially when we’re iterating on a function, and be like, \"Okay, was this a colossal problem? Why was this bad?\"\n\n[00:31:41] Raza Habib: How often is the problem just the prompt itself? How much of the time can you improve things through prompting versus other interventions?\n\n[00:31:49] James Yu: I would say the vast majority you can improve through prompting and/or deciding, “Hey, we’re not going to release this feature.” Right? We would just hold, where we're like, \"This is not at the quality level that we feel would be useful on a daily basis.\" That being said, we are now also doing a bunch of fine-tuning experiments where we are fine-tuning based on the voice of the novelist, and that reduces the problem of tropiness or things that feel out of character. So, I think those problems of that nature, which are about tone and voice, are more suited to fine-tuning or LoRAs. That’s something we’re doing a bunch of research in.\n\n[00:32:30] Raza Habib: The intuition that I have for this is that if it’s the kind of thing that’s very hard to tell, if it’s like a \"show, don’t tell\" type of attribute, then it’s probably better done through fine-tuning, right? Like, if you can’t articulate it in natural language, it’s going to be very hard to do it in a prompt. But if you can clearly explain it to another person, then I find prompting is often the way to go.\n\n[00:32:51] James Yu: I think that’s a fairly accurate representation. And so, therefore, a lot of the problems are things that you can describe, right? And also, our users can describe pretty well. I think there’s one exception, which is tropiness in some ways because you can tell there are certain kinds of turns or phrases that are being used. Obviously, you can try to prompt against that, but we found that it’s not quite there.\n\n[00:33:12] Raza Habib: Interesting thought. Do you guys do any analysis across your multiple writers? Like, is there anything that you're learning from different writing styles or improving the models in some way? Take tropiness as an example. Can you kind of do cliche detection? Almost like, \"Hey, by the way, you’re writing in a style that’s really similar to everybody else.\" You could imagine that kind of feature. Do you have anything like that today?\n\n[00:33:35] James Yu: We don’t have a feature for that specifically. We have features that try to coax cliches out of the models. For example, if you go to ChatGPT today and say, “Hey, write a small-town romance,” there’s a 99% chance that town will be set in a place called Willow Creek. We don’t know why it’s always Willow Creek. It’s like 90% of the time, it’s Willow Creek. If it’s a fantasy novel, it’s a town called Eldoria. We don’t know why these strings do appear in literature, but they’re not that notable. There are some novels, I believe, but yeah. So we have prompting—not specifically for Willow Creek—but we found that certain types of prompting will eject it, at least from this particular latent space. There’s still maybe a 30% chance it will still be Willow Creek. That’s why we always say, like, the solution to that kind of tropiness is, \"Put in your original content.\" Please do not start from the standstill of, \"Generate the entire novel from this one paragraph.\" It just doesn’t work very well. If you want to do that, I mean, sure, we’re not stopping you from doing that, but you’re probably going to get stuff that falls into the easy spaces—the easy tropes that GPT will just\n\n[00:33:35] James Yu:\n\nWe don't have a feature for that. Specifically, we have features that try to coax clichés out of the models. For example, if you go to ChatGPT today and say, \"Hey, write a small-town romance,\" 99% of the time, that town will be set in a place called Willow Creek. We don't know why it's always Willow Creek. It's like a 90% chance that it's Willow Creek, and if it's a fantasy novel, it's a town called Eldoria. We don't know why these names appear in literature, but they're not that notable. I mean, there are some novels like that, sure.\n\nWe have prompts, not specifically for Willow Creek, but we found that certain types of prompts will eject it, at least from this particular latent space. More likely, though, maybe 30% of the time, it would still be Willow Creek. That's why we always say the solution to this kind of trope is to put in your original content. Please don't start from scratch and generate the entire novel from one paragraph. It just doesn't work well. If you want to do that, we're not stopping you, but you're probably going to end up with stuff that falls into the easy spaces, the easy tropes, that ChatGPT offers up.\n\nThat said, we do try some trope detection to catch things like \"Willow Creek.\" It's funny; our users actually have lists they share with each other of all these tropes that occur over and over. We have something called a plugin system in Superwrite, where they can make their own prompts and share them with our user base. People have made trope detectors and trope \"washers\" that present a list to the AI and say, \"Do not write about this,\" or, \"Please detect when you see this so I know how to rewrite it.\" These are like band-aids. I think the right solution is probably some kind of fine-tuning because we found that when you fine-tune, Willow Creek goes away, especially when you're doing it on a particular author's corpus of works, which doesn't include Willow Creek.\n\n[00:35:43] Raza Habib:\n\nTo get that to work in practice, how much of the author's work do you need for it to be a plausibly good fine-tune?\n\n[00:35:49] James Yu:\n\nNot that much. In our current workflows, we're seeing that even just two or three chapters are enough with the current state-of-the-art models for what I call \"unmasking.\" As I mentioned before, I love DaVinci, and deep inside the reptile brain of GPT-4, DaVinci still lives. I like to say it unmasks all these tropes. As soon as you do even a little fine-tuning, we see much more original content.\n\nI hesitate to use the word \"original\" because what's original to one person is a cliché to another, but in our tests, our writers say, \"Yeah, this sounds more like me.\" Especially when you do a side-by-side comparison. That being said, more content can be better too, so we're experimenting with people uploading multiple series of novels—like 500,000 words—but I see diminishing returns after about one novel.\n\n[00:36:55] Raza Habib:\n\nFinal question on how you build this, and then I want to talk more about the bigger picture—what it means to have AI for creative work. What skills are needed to build something like Sudowrite? If someone's assembling an AI product team today, what's the structure? What kind of people have you brought together? Do you have people with deep machine learning expertise?\n\n[00:37:18] James Yu:\n\nI feel strongly that any AI startup needs domain expertise, which might be the most important thing. If you're making a legal startup or a chef AI tool, you'd better have cooking experience or consult with chefs. Domain expertise is necessary to bring something from a cool Twitter demo to something retentive, like how novelists want to use our tool daily.\n\nHalf our engineers have English majors, or they're avid readers or writers, so they understand the domain and the problems writers face. That was the number one thing. We're mostly full-stack engineers because I see the UX as a lot of the value we're delivering. With the newest models, it's easier to have a team that doesn't need PhDs in machine learning to deliver a high-quality product.\n\nThat being said, we are up-leveling on machine learning. We have consultants, and one of our engineers is taking the torch as our ML engineer. I would say all of our engineers have deep experience in prompt engineering and use these tools daily. The other big aspect is community. I'd say about 50% of our effort is cultivating a community around the tool, especially for a creative tool like this.\n\nWe even employ community members to teach others—like thriller or romance writers teaching beginners. We also have a designer, but many of our engineers are good product engineers too. I'm looking for people who have that full-stack vertical experience and can understand user problems, work with our designer and machine learning expert, and figure out how to deliver solutions.\n\n[00:40:03] Raza Habib:\n\nSo you prioritize domain expertise over AI expertise, and then you staff the team with full-stack people who can understand user needs, ideally with prompt engineering experience? In order, you’d prioritize domain expertise, full-stack engineering, then prompt engineering, then ML experience, right?\n\n[00:40:26] James Yu:\n\nYes, unless you're building models from scratch. But if you're making AI tools for real people, that's the structure.\n\n[00:40:34] Raza Habib:\n\nSome people refer to the \"API dividing line.\" Some build models, and others build products using those models. There's an abstraction barrier now.\n\n[00:40:43] James Yu:\n\nYes, that’s a good way to put it.\n\n[00:40:43] Raza Habib:\n\nSo AI for creative work is something that could be quite controversial. I remember a moment a year and a half ago when \"AI\" with a big cross through it was trending on ArtStation after all the image models came out. Also, I know when you launched Story Engine, the first version, you had a mixed response on Twitter. Some were very positive, but others almost tried to cancel you. Could you share that experience? Why do you think critics reacted that way, and what do you think they got right or wrong?\n\n[00:41:27] James Yu:\n\nYeah, when we launched Story Engine, I posted a video about how you could collaborate with the AI to flesh out an entire chapter. This struck a chord because it was during the WGA strike, and lawsuits were in the news every day. My video caught that zeitgeist, so the reaction was very polarized. Some were anti-AI for any creative process—text, images, video, etc. And on the other side were those who saw it as a tool, thinking, \"Oh yeah, this could help me with my craft.\" The nuance got lost.\n\n[00:42:11] Raza Habib:\n\nThe nuance definitely got lost. I'll link to the original post in the show notes because it's hard to communicate the visceral emotion both sides felt. You clearly struck a chord, and AI and creativity evoke strong emotional reactions.\n\n[00:42:33] James Yu:\n\nYes, very strong emotions. It was a tough week.\n\n[00:42:37] Raza Habib:\n\nI can imagine.\n\n[00:42:39] James Yu:\n\nI think it speaks more about how social networks are structured. People dunk on things in line with their tribe, and there’s no nuance.\n\n[00:42:52] Raza Habib:\n\nAnd it's so easy to criticize something without actually doing anything yourself.\n\n[00:42:57] James Yu:\n\nExactly. No one watched the video either. The analytics showed that people watched one second of it. It was all retweets and brigading. In retrospect, I struck a chord and sparked interesting discussions about how AI fits into the creative landscape.\n\nIt's still a mixed conversation. Just last night, Timbaland posted about using AI to flesh out old songs, and in music, it's more accepted because of more technological innovation. But in the literary world, tools haven’t really penetrated content creation in a meaningful way. Maybe you could say spell check or Grammarly features have, but how we write hasn’t changed much in hundreds of years.\n\nSince 2020 with GPT-3, we’ve had to wrestle with philosophical questions that used to be sci-fi but are now real. We have a tool that can understand your story, give suggestions, and even write parts of it. It’s a big shift, and I understand the fear—is it going to take jobs or be trained on my works? I do believe authors should get compensation for their works being trained on, but how we figure that out as a society is complex. It’s a question the courts are dealing with now.\n\n[00:45:55] Raza Habib:\n\nI think there's a spectrum. To an extent, AI is just another tool, like Photoshop or a camera—it helps us achieve our goals better and faster. But there’s a qualitative difference between a tool that can have its own goals and reason like humans. We're not quite there yet, but we’re on that trajectory, with systems that have goals and subgoals, and so they'll have to start having goals of their own. That's a key difference. Photoshop can't decide to do something on its own, but AI systems can already do that, like recommender systems.\n\n[00:47:01] James Yu:\n\nYeah, I think there is a gradation. Even in Story Engine or Story Bible, under the hood, we're giving the AI a goal like, \"Create an evocative scene.\" Some people have experimented with having the AI write an entire novel at the push of a button, but that doesn't stop you from writing your own novel. I still believe that people will want to read stories where humans are part of the creative loop.\n\n[00:47:32] Raza Habib:\n\nSomething I worry about, and others do too, is what gets referred to as \"AI slop\"—low-quality, high-volume content that overwhelms the good stuff. Could bad writing flood the market and make it harder to find high-quality content?\n\n[00:48:05] James Yu:\n\nI don’t worry too much about that. There's already a lot of human slop out there, and the good stuff still rises to the top. Even before AI, there were lots of bad books and movies. We have recommendation algorithms, and word of mouth is still king. How do you figure out what book to read next? Most people would say, \"My friend recommended it.\"\n\nI don't think AI slop will edge out the good stuff. The really talented writers will begin adopting AI in their process, and I trust their taste. Sure, there will be people trying to push out spam with AI, but I think that will be temporary. As a society, we'll still prioritize the good stuff.\n\n[00:49:26] Raza Habib:\n\nOne last question specific to you, then one we ask everyone. When people read a novel, they often feel a connection to the author. It’s that sense of connection that makes a book valuable. Do you think AI might undermine that?\n\n[00:49:53] James Yu:\n\nI think that goes back to human trust. Throughout art history, artists have employed teams to help create things. They weren’t doing every single part of the process, but the final piece still reflected their taste and their connection to the human experience. I don’t see it being any different with AI. Some people will try to generate everything without reviewing it, but that's not the same as what a thoughtful creator would do with their work.\n\n[00:50:39] Raza Habib:\n\nThat resonates with me. We still talk about AI in terms of existing literary forms, but we haven’t touched on new literary experiences AI could create—novels where you interact with characters or fork the story. There’s so much possibility, but let’s wrap up. We ask everyone this: if you imagine the world five years from now, what will be the same, and what will be different because of AI? And is AI under-hyped or over-hyped?\n\n[00:51:37] James Yu:\n\nGreat question. In five years, I think things will move slower than expected in some ways. Four years post-GPT-3, we’re seeing uneven productive use of AI in different industries. In some verticals, like coding, AI is a boon—everyone's talking about tools like Cursor. But AI can’t just autonomously create everything, and I think the hype around agents was overblown. I see those timelines being longer, especially for regulated industries.\n\nWe’ll see breakthroughs in verticals that surprise us. I think we'll see major breakthroughs in coding—I'm closer to that area. But in the literary world, I think AI adoption will grow, but there will still be debate. In music and audiovisual sectors, adoption may be faster. In the physical world, I use Waymo in San Francisco, and I think autonomous vehicles will be widespread in five years.\n\nIn terms of what's under-hyped and over-hyped: I think agents are over-hyped. Cool demos, but not many real-world applications yet. That might change, but I see it further out. Prompt engineering, on the other hand, is under-hyped. We’re only scratching the surface. Even people at OpenAI and Anthropic have barely tapped into what’s possible. These models are like alien black boxes, and we're still figuring them out. I think multilingual prompts are another under-explored area.\n\n[00:55:42] Raza Habib:\n\nOn that bombshell, maybe we should end the conversation here. James, I’ve really enjoyed chatting. I think Sudowrite is one of the more interesting AI applications out there, helping people be more creative. It’s had a lot of success in retaining a large user base, which is rare for AI products. Thanks for coming on.",

What Makes a Good AI Writing Tool?\n\nI began by deciding what is most important with an AI writing tool for the content creation process. These included:\n\nFunctionality: I checked out and tried the specific writing tasks each tool could assist with, such as brainstorming, grammar checks, character development, and dialogue generation.\n\nEase of Use: How easy was it to get the AI to work for writing stories? How good were those stories?\n\nPricing: I looked at the pricing models, including subscription-based access, one-time purchase prices, and pay-per-use models.\n\nUser Experience and Support: I looked to see which tools have immediate chat support, and which you need to email.\n\n2. Data from Reputable Sources\n\nI collected data from a variety of reputable sources, including:\n\nOfficial Websites: Visiting the official websites of each AI writing tool to gather detailed information on features, pricing, and user testimonials.\n\nExpert Reviews: Reading expert reviews and articles from trusted tech and writing industry publications to gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each tool.\n\nUser Reviews: I looked at user reviews on platforms like G2, Capterra, and Trustpilot to understand other people’s real-world experiences.\n\n3.

This included:\n\nContent Generation: Assessing the quality and variety of content each tool could generate.\n\nCustomization Options: Evaluating the level of control and customization available to users.\n\nSupport and Community: Checking for the availability of customer support, user communities, and refund policies.\n\n4.

      "# [Sudowrite Review (2025): As Good As A Human? by Jamie Giggs on 2024-03-15](https://bloggingwizard.com/sudowrite-review/)\nWelcome to our Sudowrite review.\n\nSudowrite is an AI writing tool that helps writers finish their manuscripts.\n\nThe platform features a story engine, rewrite functionality, and is able to provide feedback as you progress.\n\nThe key question: is it worth your time?\n\nBy the end of this review, you’ll know the answer, including whether it suits your specific needs.\n\nWe’ll dive into Sudowrite’s capabilities, explore the plans available, and detail what we think are the software’s main pros and cons.\n\nWhat is Sudowrite?\n\nSudowrite is an AI writing tool founded in 2020 by science fiction writers Amit Gupta and James Yu.\n\nAs writers themselves, Amit and James knew all too well the pain that writers experience when rewriting their beloved manuscripts for the 1000th time (trust me, I’ve been there!).\n\nThe pair wanted to create software that broke through writer’s block and invented narrative twists for the user, so writers spent less time dreading the process (and contemplating reality itself) and more time actually writing.\n\nThe result of their efforts? A tool that, at its best, can effectively deliver cogent paragraphs of text that can inspire you to keep writing. One that’s used by over 12,000 novelists, screenwriters, and storytellers.\n\nThat said, is it enough to become your AI writing tool of choice, or should you continue to push on without the help of a machine?\n\nContinue reading for our full review of Sudowrite. I’ll discuss the pros and cons and a few alternatives, too.\n\nWhat features does Sudowrite offer?\n\nSudowrite is a popular AI writing tool. The key features worth knowing about include:\n\nAI writer\n\nRewriter\n\nDescribe\n\nBrainstorm\n\nPoem generator\n\nCustomer support\n\nIntegrations\n\nWe’ll explore these features and give you a first-hand look at the tool.\n\nPlease note: Some of Sudowrite’s features are only available in specific pricing plans.\n\nGetting started\n\nOnce you’ve logged into Sudowrite, you’ll be taken to a screen that looks like this:\n\nIt’s here where you’ll be able to use the central features of the AI writing tool.\n\nIt’s worth noting that there’s also a “tour” feature that takes you through the basics (if need be).\n\nAI writer\n\nTo start using the AI writer, you’ll first need to give it something to work with. This isn’t a couple of words either; the tool requires at least 20 words or more before the cursor.\n\nThere are two ways you can do this: putting in the required 20 words and clicking Write, or turning on the Story Bible (formerly Sudowrite’s story engine) like so:\n\nEssentially, using the Story Bible makes the tool more accurate because you fill in the key details yourself. Those key details include the synopsis of your novel, the style you want it to be written in, details of the main characters, the genre, and, if you can provide it, a general outline of your story by chapter.\n\nThere’s also a section called Braindump. This is where you can put in any extra details and in any form you want, whether that’s a stream-of-consciousness word salad or just a few sentences.\n\nBefore we take a look at the results of the Story Bible mode, let’s see what the regular mode can produce.\n\nI asked the tool to start writing a novel based on a jaded teacher who explores the origins of a portal. Here’s a snippet of what it came up with:\n\n“As Angus trudged along the rugged path in the Scottish Highlands, his mind was clouded with a sense of melancholy. The weight of his monotonous existence as a jaded teacher seemed to grow heavier with each passing day. He had lost the spark that once ignited his passion for education, leaving him with an empty heart and a hollow soul.”\n\nIt’s not bad. Sudowrite has focused on the key elements of the story, including the jaded teacher, and chosen a good setting for him to explore. There’s quite a bit of telling here, though, rather than showing, so it would definitely need editing. That said, it may well be a good starting point if I needed an idea I could run with.\n\nWe can choose to Insert this text into the main editor, and from there, we can edit it as required. That said, it’s more of a summary piece of text than an actual chapter of a novel, which takes us back to the Story Bible mode.\n\nIf we fill out the details like character, setting, and provide a synopsis for our novel, we can get Sudowrite to create the first draft of a chapter. I input the details, and this was the result of the opening of Chapter 1:\n\n“In the bustling city of New York, Angus, a young journalist, begins to notice strange occurrences in the local government. He starts to collect information for a story, but the closer he gets to the truth, the more he is warned to stay away.”\n\nIt sounds pretty engaging, although it’s worth mentioning that the tool struggled to fill out the rest of the chapter and has changed our main character, Angus, to a young journalist living in New York. What’s here is good, but the details aren’t exactly what I asked for.\n\nThat being said, the tool can go further. I asked it to expand the text, and it came up with the next 15 chapters.\n\nFor example, in Chapter 5, Angus meets a man named Jeff, who trains him in self-defense, hacking, and espionage techniques. Angus also learns about the history of mind-control technology and how it’s been secretly developed over decades.\n\nThe rest of the outline is relatively decent and would certainly help an author during the preliminary stages of planning their novel. As a way of generating ideas, it’s solid.\n\nI asked the tool again to expand the first chapter, and here’s one of the opening paragraphs:\n\n“A woman’s voice chimed in, her tone icy and detached, ‘we discovered that our suspicions were correct—the government has been conducting experiments on innocent civilians.’ She paused for effect, her breath frosting as it met the frigid air. ‘Not just any experiments, though. They’re trying to create…monsters.’\n\n“‘Monsters?’ Angus echoed, his voice barely above a whisper. His mind raced with horrifying images, each one more grotesque than the last. Unwillingly, he recalled the eerie stories his grandmother used to tell him as a child, stories he had long dismissed as mere folklore.”\n\nAs an opener, this definitely lures the reader in. However, the story is a little basic and seems to involve the government creating “monsters.” As it goes on, some of the text lacks the depth I’d expect from a published novel, and it does come across as somewhat amateur.\n\nThat said, we can choose to add this text to the editor and refine it from there:\n\nOverall, the AI writer, albeit far from perfect, is a great way to bounce story ideas around.\n\nRewriter\n\nSudowrite’s Rewriter feature is a useful addition to the suite. Clicking the Rewrite button allows us to change bits of text we’re not happy with and even alter the writing style:\n\nFor the first paragraph of Chapter 1, I asked the tool to rewrite it in a more descriptive style. Here’s a snippet of the result:\n\n“The narrow alleyway loomed before Angus, its walls closing in on him as he approached the designated meeting spot. The air felt thick and heavy, like a looming sense of danger that threatened to suffocate him.\n\nHis heart thudded heavily against his ribcage, matching the rhythm of his quickened steps. Beads of sweat gathered at his temples, despite the biting cold that seeped into his bones. He questioned his sanity for getting involved with this dangerous conspiracy, but there was no turning back now.”\n\nWe can see that, in no time at all, more adjectives have been added to the text. The text, as a whole, now feels more engaging and works better as a pacey opener to what I would imagine would be a cross between mystery and thriller.\n\nWe can choose to rephrase the text if we’re unsure about the result simply by clicking Rephrase. Here’s that same paragraph reworked:\n\n“Angus felt the walls of the dim alleyway closing in on him as he made his way towards the predetermined meeting spot. His heart pounded against his chest and sweat formed on his forehead, despite the frigid air. He couldn’t help but question his own judgment for getting involved in this dangerous scheme, but it was too late to turn back now.”\n\nAs you can see, a selection of words have been changed, with others moved around. Sudowrite provides you with variants of the rewrite. For instance, if I scroll down the page, I can see a more descriptive version of the rewrite, one that’s another rephrase, and an additional descriptive version, giving me plenty of choice.\n\nI can also use the rewrite functionality to add more in the way of showing rather than telling to the piece. All good writers know the importance of getting these two right, and it’s great to see an option to cut down on some of that intrusive telling. Here’s the result:\n\n“The narrow alley was shrouded in darkness as Angus cautiously made his way towards the designated meeting spot. The cold air stung his cheeks and he could feel his heart pounding against his chest.\n\nHis palms were slick with sweat, a mixture of nerves and fear. As he approached the figure standing in the shadows, he couldn’t help but question his judgement for getting involved in this dangerous scheme. But it was too late to turn back.”\n\nThe cold air stinging his cheeks creates a strong image in our mind, and it’s a more powerful way of showing the reader that it’s cold. That said, I’m not sure we need to even say it’s cold. We could show that further, although that’s a story for another time.\n\nAll in all, the rewrite functionality impressed me, and while I wouldn’t rely on it solely, it could serve as a way to get me writing again.\n\nDescribe\n\nLeaving Angus and the government monster scheme behind, another notable feature of Sudowrite is the Describe feature. We can activate it like so:\n\nWe simply highlight a word or phrase we want to describe, and Sudowrite will give us suggestions based on all five senses–this includes the use of metaphors.\n\nKeeping to the theme, I highlighted the word “Monster,” and this was what the tool produced for sight:\n\n“The monster’s body was a tangle of twisted limbs, each one ending in sharp claws that glinted in the dim light. Its skin was a sickly pale color, almost translucent, and covered in pulsating veins.”\n\nHere’s what it generated for smell:\n\n“The stench of decay surrounds the monster, a mixture of rotting flesh and damp earth. Its breath reeks of death and its presence fills the air with a nauseating odor.”\n\nQuite vivid. Here’s another for taste:\n\n“The thought of tasting the monster’s flesh made one’s stomach churn. It was said that those who had tried had described it as a foul combination of dirt, mold, and something unidentifiable yet repulsive.”\n\nIn terms of metaphors, Sudowrite generated this:\n\n“The monster was born of shadows and whispers, a creature of the night with eyes that glowed like embers and a roar that could shatter even the bravest of hearts. Its terrifying form was both primordial and otherworldly, a reminder of the dark secrets that lurk within us all.”\n\nThe senses are better than the metaphor. Still, it’s a helpful addition to get the neurons firing.\n\nBrainstorm\n\nWhat about those times when you just need writing ideas in general, whether it’s character names, settings, or even plot points? Well, Sudowrite does have a feature that can help.\n\nIt’s located here:\n\nOnce we’ve clicked that, we’re taken to an attractive-looking grid:\n\nIt’s here where we can pick the specific part of writing we need help with. As a fan of great world-building myself, I chose to see what Sudowrite could do in that department. Here’s the result:\n\n“A mysterious black stone found only in the depths of the ocean, it glows with a faint blue light and has been known to give its owner the power to control minds.”\n\nIt’s a strange derivative, considering I asked the tool to describe a fantasy world. I tried again, and here was the second result:\n\n“The Phantom’s Touch: An illegal substance created from the ashes of a being from a different dimension, it gives the user the ability to phase through objects and render themselves invisible for a short period of time.”\n\nWhile I like the description here, I asked the tool to do something else. I played some more with it and found that Sudowrite prefers to describe items within the fictional world rather than the world itself.\n\nNot the best result here.\n\nI tried asking the tool to create some names for an island nation inhabited by warriors. The results:\n\nThundercliff\n\nSavage Coast\n\nValoria\n\nShieldhaven\n\nShield Isle\n\nA better result overall, although it’s clear Sudowrite does have its limitations.\n\nPoem generator\n\nPoem lovers will be pleased to know that Sudowrite can create poems. I asked it to create a poem on danger, and here’s the first paragraph of what it came up with:\n\nBullets for Breakfast\n\nIn the land of the free, we sip coffee and load our guns\n\nWe cook our eggs and fry our bacon,\n\nButter our toast and oil our guns\n\nWe kiss our loved ones goodbye and holster our guns\n\nIt’s a decent result, if a tad nonsensical.\n\nI asked it to create a second poem on writing itself:\n\nThe Muse’s Gift\n\nIt comes in waves, this gift of words\n\nSometimes a trickle, sometimes a flood\n\nA turn of phrase, a thought profound\n\nWords from my muse, my pen unbound\n\nA better result.\n\nHow much mileage you’ll get out of the poem generator will depend on your needs, but it’s a respectable extra.\n\nCustomer support\n\nSudowrite does feature customer support, albeit one that isn’t that extensive.\n\nBy clicking the question mark symbol on the dashboard, you’ll be able to reach the team via email, live chat, or you can, instead, consult the FAQ guide:\n\nThe FAQs are simple but get the job done with some (fairly) thorough answers.\n\nThe live chat loaded up quickly, although I did have to wait some time before a member of the team could answer my query. Clicking the Support button at the bottom of the page will also bring up the live chat.\n\nFinally, there’s the ability to suggest new features to the team–something I thought was welcome.\n\nIntegrations\n\nSudowrite’s integrations are currently limited. The tool integrates with Google Docs, Invoice2go, and Airtable.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nSudowrite comes in three main tiers: Hobby & Student, Professional, and Max. Naturally, each plan includes differing features, benefits, and usage limits.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each of them.\n\nSudowrite’s Hobby & Student plan starts at $10 per month on the yearly plan or $19 on the monthly plan. It includes 225,000 credits per month.\n\nA credit is based on the AI model and how many words it reads and writes for you. This plan comes with a free trial, and no credit card is required. It’s aimed at people who write for fun or for school and need help with the writing process.

It’s not perfect, but the AI tool can successfully create text for your novel, whether that’s a chapter summary or the entire chapter itself. This can be achieved in a few minutes if you have the necessary credits.\n\nRewriter functionality. The option to rewrite paragraphs and include more showing (and less telling) is here. You can also add in extra description or make sentences more intense. This is perhaps the most useful part for full-time writers.\n\nWriting senses generator. Sudowrite can generate descriptions for each of the five senses based on a single word or phrase. You can also get it to produce metaphors of varying quality. It’s a helpful feature.\n\nCons\n\nAffordability. The tool could be cheaper, and the credits won’t last long if you’re attempting a full novel of 70,000+ words.\n\nLack of integrations. There are very few integrations at the time of writing, although we do expect this to change over time.\n\nCustomer support. What’s here is serviceable, but it’s not outstanding. There isn’t much in the way of additional support should you need it.\n\nAlternatives\n\nNeed to look at some alternatives?

Let's look at who benefits the most from using it!\n\nWho Should Use Sudowrite?\n\nAnyone interested in creative writing should use Sudowrite, even just for fun. Trust me, it's worth it. However, there are a few types of people Sudowrite AI is most suitable:\n\nFiction Writers: Sudowrite is most suited for writers struggling with writer's block as it offers all the tools you need to write a novel or short story. Use the Brainstorm tool to generate ideas to build worlds and characters and develop an outline using AI with Canvas. Add that outline to the Story Bible to get AI to write your entire novel one chapter at a time.\n\nStudents: Sudowrite is an invaluable resource for students, especially those studying literature or creative writing. Whether you need help writing essays, analyzing literature, or crafting compelling stories for assignments, Sudowrite's AI writing assistant can be your go-to tool. It provides guidance and suggestions and even helps you refine your writing style.\n\nBloggers: For bloggers looking to create engaging content, use Sudowrite to generate fresh ideas, craft compelling headlines, and structure your blog posts.

It has a dedicated “Poem” tool that generates a contemporary free verse poem in seconds!\n\nGetting Started with Sudowrite\n\nI started by going to the Sudowrite homepage, scrolling down, and selecting “Try Sudowrite for Free” in the bottom right corner.\n\nSudowrite is free forever (no credit card required) with a generous starting balance of 50,000 credits. Once those credits are consumed, plans start at $10 per month, making Sudowrite affordable for writers of all levels.\n\nOnce I signed up, Sudowrite gave me a quick demo of how to write and describe using AI. I found the demo helpful, giving me more confidence in using Sudowrite as my AI writer.\n\nAfter the demo, I was taken to an untitled Sudowrite project where I could start writing. The user interface was clean and intuitive, making navigating the various features and tools Sudowrite offers easy.\n\nLet's get into a brief explanation of the Sudowrite tools and how to use them.\n\nSudowrite Tools\n\nSudowrite offers a range of tools that writers can use to enhance their writing process, which can be divided into three categories:\n\nBrainstorming Tools\n\nWriting Tools\n\nEditing Tools\n\nWe'll explore the main tools that come with Sudowrite, and I will show you how I used these tools to begin writing a novel!\n\n1. Brainstorming Tools\n\nWhether you're writing fiction, blog posts, or any other creative content, these brainstorming tools provide practical help, enabling you to generate unique and captivating storylines:\n\nBrainstorm: “Brainstorm” is a giant list builder that generates the perfect name or title. It's like having a reliable and endless source of ideas. Give a thumbs up to your favorite ideas, which will provide you with even better ones.\n\nCanvas: “Canvas” allows you to create an outline containing a summary of your story, character secrets, and plot twists. It's a convenient space to store all your inspiration and references in one location.\n\nVisualize: “Visualize” enhances your character sheets and world-building documents by turning your descriptions into captivating artwork.\n\nHow I Used Sudowrite's Brainstorm Tools\n\nHere's how I used Sudowrite's brainstorming tools to get ideas for a story to write using Sudowrite.\n\nBrainstorm\n\nIn my Sudowrite project, I selected “Brainstorm” at the top.\n\nI was asked what I wanted to brainstorm, ranging from dialogues, names, characters, places, and more! I selected “Something Else” to generate my novel title.\n\nFor Sudowrite to give me a list of potential titles for my novel, I had to tell it what to provide me with (in my case, “Novel titles.”)\n\nOptionally, I could give Sudowrite some context and title examples. I didn't have any examples, so I left that blank. However, I did have some context of the novel I was planning on writing, so I placed that in the “Context” field.\n\nFrom there, I hit “Start” to see what novel title ideas Sudowrite would generate.\n\nInstantly, Sudowrite gave me a list of engaging novel titles! All of the ideas were good, but there was one that I particularly liked: “Three Minutes Ahead: A Detective LaBlanche Mystery.”\n\nI gave it a thumbs up to add it to my “Keepers” list, and that title was immediately replaced with another excellent title. If I didn't like the title, I could give it a thumbs down to be instantly replaced with a new title.\n\nWhether I selected the thumbs up or down, each idea was replaced with a new one. The Sudowrite brainstorm feature is a never-ending source of creative inspiration!\n\nAfter saving my list and exiting, I returned to my Sudowrite project. Sudowrite AI added my Brainstorm list to the History panel on the right, where I could easily insert, copy, open, or favorite it anytime!\n\nSudowrite's brainstorming tool is invaluable for any writer looking to generate fresh ideas like dialogues, names, characters, places, or plot points. With a few clicks, you can unlock a wealth of creativity to fuel your storytelling!\n\nCanvas\n\nWithin my Sudowrite project, I selected “Canvas” on the bottom left.\n\nI was greeted with a large canvas with character cards, images, and an outline! Sudowrite did an excellent job clearly explaining how to use the canvas, which can initially feel overwhelming.\n\nI could start from scratch with blank cards, labels, and outlines by adding them to the bottom of the canvas. Alternatively, I could build characters and a storyline with what was already filled out. I went with the latter.\n\nI started by hovering my mouse over the character cards and selecting the “+” icon to get Sudowrite to generate more character descriptions for me.\n\nSudowrite did an excellent job! This is a great way to add more depth to my characters.\n\nVisualize\n\nI could also select “Visualize” to get Sudowrite to generate an image of the character in seconds based on the description.\n\nThe image looks excellent and fits the description perfectly! This feature brought my characters to life and helped me visualize them in my story.\n\nOn the right was the entire outline for my story. I selected “Generate full outline,” and the whole thing was populated a few seconds later. It was like having a personal writing assistant right at my fingertips.\n\nNext, I selected one of the cards in my outline and clicked “Generate options for this card” to see variations of this part of the story.\n\nSudowrite always generates three variations at a time. Here's one of them:\n\nSudowrite did a fantastic job developing options for this card. The text appears as though it was written by a person, offering me a new viewpoint on how the scene could unfold and enhancing the depth of my overall storyline.\n\nThe Sudowrite canvas is a powerful tool for writers, especially those who may feel overwhelmed by starting from scratch. From generating character descriptions and visuals to creating an entire outline in seconds, Sudowrite is the perfect tool to enhance your storytelling.\n\n2. Writing Tools\n\nUse these writing tools to overcome writer’s block, refine your writing style, and write engaging content:\n\nWrite: “Write” analyzes the traits of your characters, the tone of your writing, and the progression of your plot. From there, it generates 300 words in your unique tone of voice. It also gives you different variations to choose from!\n\nDescribe: Sudowrite's “Describe” tool lets you highlight and describe specific things in your story to facilitate a strong connection between your readers and your characters. This helps your readers feel fully immersed in the story.\n\nExpand: “Expand” enhances the pacing of your story so it isn't too fast, maintaining an ideal pace that prevents readers from being disconnected.\n\nStory Bible (Story Engine): The “Story Bible” feature guides you through each stage of the fiction writing process, from your initial idea to creating an outline, developing chapters, and ultimately generating thousands of words in your unique writing style. You can write an entire novel within a week!\n\nHow I Used Sudowrite to Start Writing a Novel\n\nHere's how I used Sudowrite to begin writing my novel.\n\nWrite\n\nTo begin writing my novel with Sudowrite, I had to write at least 20 words (Sudowrite needs some context to work its magic). After doing so, I placed my cursor at the end of it and clicked on the “Write” button, and Sudowrite sprung into action.\n\nIt's important to note that the dropdown arrow next to the “Write” button offers different writing modes: Auto, Guided (give Sudowrite instructions), and Tone Shift (change your writing style). I could also access my writing settings. In my case, I stuck with the default Auto write but feel free to experiment!\n\nInstantly, Sudowrite continued the story by populating the right panel with some options to continue the story. I skimmed through them and inserted the one I liked most by selecting the “Insert” button. Once inserted, the text turned purple, indicating that Sudowrite had written it and needed editing.\n\nI was thoroughly impressed with what Sudowrite had come up with. The options Sudowrite gave me were well-crafted and perfectly aligned with the tone and style I had in mind for my novel.\n\nThe text also hooks the reader instantly, intriguing them to delve deeper into the story. Sudowrite's ability to capture the essence of my characters and maintain the progression of the plot was remarkable!\n\nDescribe\n\nAfter making a few tweaks (Sudowrite had gotten the pronouns of my detective protagonist wrong), I wanted to explore the “Describe” feature. In my case, the silhouette is something of interest to the reader. I highlighted this word within the document and hit “Describe.”\n\nSudowrite generated descriptions of the Silhouette in the right panel using different senses and metaphors. The options were vivid and imaginative, painting a detailed picture of the silhouette! In my case, the description based on “Sight” made the most sense, so that's the one I inserted into the document.\n\nExpand\n\nAnother tool I loved in Sudowrite is the “Expand” tool, where I could highlight one or multiple sentences and continue the story at an ideal pace. I highlighted the two sentences I had just inserted describing the silhouette and selected “Expand.”\n\nHere is how Sudowrite continued my story after expanding it:\n\nI'm genuinely impressed with the quality of writing. Sudowrite did an excellent job continuing my story and establishing a high level of engagement with optimal pacing!\n\nStory Bible\n\nLast but not least is the Story Bible. This is perfect for people who don't want to start with a blank document, as it will write a first draft of every chapter for you! Crazy, right?\n\nI accessed Story Bible by turning on the “Story Bible” toggle in the bottom left of my document.\n\nFrom there, I began filling out the fields:\n\nBraindump: Write anything and everything you know about your story.\n\nGenre: Identify the genres you are writing in.\n\nStyle: Describe how the story will be written (I highly recommend using “Match my style…” to paste up to 2,000 words of your writing and have Sudowrite describe it).\n\nSynopsis: Present the characters, their goals, and the primary source of conflict while effectively capturing the tone, themes, and distinctive aspects of the story (select “Generate Synopsis” to get Sudowrite to fill this out for you).\n\nCharacters: Describe everything there is to know about the characters, including physical appearance, mannerisms, relationships, and goals (I highly recommend selecting “Generate Characters” to get Sudowrite to generate this for you).\n\nOutline: Write your outline or choose from one of five outlines provided by Sudowrite.\n\nI was thoroughly impressed with how accurately Sudowrite matched my style, generated a synopsis, and more. It made the entire process of writing my story so much easier and enjoyable.\n\nOnce complete, Sudowrite began adding chapters to my document that I could start generating by following the steps. I selected “Generate Beats” (“beats” being the main elements of the chapter), and Sudowrite did an excellent job of giving an overview of the chapter.\n\nThe second step was generating the chapter. I liked that I could choose the speed, accuracy, and more by selecting the down arrow next to the “Generate Chapter” button. This helped me tailor the output to my preferences by giving me the choice of prioritizing speed, accuracy, etc.\n\nSudowrite began writing out the story beats; I could walk away and let Sudowrite write my entire novel. It took a couple of minutes to generate (mind you, this is a whole book chapter!), but the quality of writing was worth the wait. From there, I moved on to the next chapter.\n\nEach beat was concise yet captivating, providing a clear roadmap for the chapter's progression. Sudowrite effortlessly captured the tone and themes of my story, infusing it with the same style and voice that I had established.\n\nSudowrite's Story Bible feature is an absolute game-changer for authors with writer's block who want to pump out an entire novel in a week. Within minutes, I could generate whole chapters of a book; all I had to do was edit it. It truly works like magic!\n\nMake sure you take advantage of the Story Bible resources:\n\nStory Bible Guide\n\nSudowrite Classes\n\n3. Editing Tools\n\nSudowrite’s revision tools offer practical help in revision, better word choice, and story enhancement:\n\nRewrite: Get “Rewrite” to revise your writing without doing it 100 times manually. It's incredibly adaptable, unfailingly persistent, and always open to feedback.\n\nThesaurus: Sudowrite includes an integrated “Thesaurus” where you can highlight a word and instantly generate alternative words with similar meanings.\n\nHow I Used Sudowrite to Edit a Novel\n\nHere's how I used Sudowrite to edit my novel.\n\nRewrite\n\nIf I needed to make some revisions, Sudowrite's Rewrite tool was invaluable. It allowed me to revise my writing quickly without countless manual edits. To use it, I only highlighted the sentence or sentences I wanted to rewrite and hit the “Rewrite” button.\n\nIn the right panel, I could choose how I wanted Sudowrite to rewrite my sentences, whether rephrasing them or making them shorter, more descriptive, adding inner conflict, and more. I could even give it a custom request with the “Customize” option! I went with “Rephrase” and hit “Go.”\n\nSudowrite generated two variations of the original sentence. The sentence was excellently rewritten, maintaining the meaning and providing a new perspective with more description.\n\nThesaurus\n\nSudowrite's “Thesaurus” tool (it doesn't seem to have a name; I'm just calling it that) gave me different synonyms to replace words that I felt would be better. I highlighted “billowed” in my document, and Sudowrite suggested a few synonyms.\n\nSelecting the “more…” option took me to a “word cloud” page where I could select the word I wanted to use. I chose “fluttered” and could generate more like that word or copy it to insert it into my text.\n\nAnd there you have it! My entire process of writing a novel using Sudowrite's primary brainstorming, writing, and editing tools.\n\nI was amazed by the caliber of writing Sudowrite generates and how efficient the process was, particularly with the help of Story Bible. I'm convinced anyone at any skill level can produce an entire novel within a week!\n\nWhat I Liked About Sudowrite\n\nUp to 50,000 credits on the permanently free version of Sudowrite, suitable for writers on any budget.\n\nThe interface is easy to navigate, and the tools are fun.\n\nSudowrite generates excellent results that sound human, making it a valuable tool for beginner writers.\n\nSave significant time using AI to streamline your creative process (Story Bible can write an entire novel within a week!)\n\nTools for each stage of the creative writing process, from brainstorming to writing to editing.\n\nUse AI to turn descriptions into artwork instantly for better visualization.\n\nThe content is written accurately in your unique tone of voice.\n\nKeep readers engaged by using AI to describe things in your story more deeply and expand text for optimal pacing.\n\nGet Sudowrite to rewrite up to six variations simultaneously rather than doing this manually.\n\nHighlight individual words and select better synonyms Sudowrite suggests.\n\nChapters are organized neatly within projects.\n\nWrites in almost any language; does not plagiarize.\n\nSudowrite Google Chrome Extension for those who want to use Sudowrite in Google Docs.\n\nSudowrite Discord community if you have questions or want to connect with like-minded AI writers.\n\nSudowrite Manual on how to use Sudowrite.\n\nWhat I Disliked About Sudowrite\n\nSudowrite may get aspects of the story wrong, such as pronouns or characters.\n\nA lot of features may feel overwhelming for some users.\n\nThe canvas feature was useful but felt clunky.\n\nTop 3 Sudowrite Alternatives I've Tried\n\nIn this section, I will compare Sudowrite to other AI story generators I've used to help you decide which tool best suits your writing needs.\n\nJasper AI\n\nJasper AI is among the best AI writing assistants on the market. Give it a text prompt, and it will generate creative and engaging content in your unique tone of voice. You can write an entire story or a 1,500-word article in seconds!\n\nOne of the most significant differences between the platforms is the target demographics. Jasper AI is designed more for marketing teams and businesses to maintain a consistent brand voice while collaborating on generating compelling content across multiple channels. There's a feature for creating brand voices and campaigns, which Sudowrite does not have.\n\nMeanwhile, Sudowrite is more geared towards creative writers who want to rekindle their passion for writing and overcome writer's block. Tools like the Canvas for describing characters and creating outlines and the Story Bible that generates an entire novel chapter by chapter make it clear that Sudowrite focuses on providing a creative writing experience.\n\nWhile both tools benefit marketers and creative writers, choose Jasper for more robust marketing and business tools for your team to collaborate. If you are a creative writer, like an author or poet, choose Sudowrite.\n\nWe also Compare Jasper Vs. Copy AI & Jasper Vs. Scalenut.\n\nRead our Jasper Review or visit Jasper.\n\nWritesonic\n\nWritesonic is another powerful writing tool that uses AI technology to create high-quality content. With Writesonic, you can generate blog posts, social media captions, and generate entire stories with just a few clicks.\n\nWhat sets Writesonic apart from Sudowrite is its ability to cater to a wide range of writing needs. Whether you're a content marketer looking for catchy headlines or a startup founder needing persuasive copy for your landing page, Writesonic has what you need.\n\nThe platform offers various templates and prompts to get your creative juices flowing. You can give specific details about your topic or let Writesonic develop creative ideas for you. It is incredibly user-friendly and intuitive, making it accessible to writers of all skill levels.\n\nOne notable feature of Writesonic is its ability to generate entire stories. Whether you're in need of a short fiction piece or a longer narrative, Writesonic can provide you with a well-crafted story that captures the essence of your chosen genre.\n\nAlthough Writesonic can write stories from start to finish, it also offers tools and templates for other types of writers. Choose Writesonic if you plan on using it as a writing tool for a variety of purposes that go beyond story writing. For fictional writers who want more robust brainstorming, writing, and editing tools for their novels, choose Sudowrite!\n\nRead our Writesonic Review or visit Writesonic.\n\nPlot Factory\n\nPlot Factory is another AI-powered writing platform that allows you to collaboratively plan, organize, and write stories. Unlike Sudowrite and Jasper AI, Plot Factory focuses specifically on helping writers develop and organize their story plots. However, it still generates stories with AI.\n\nWith Plot Factory, you can create different “universes” that house stories, characters, places, objects, and more. It provides a comprehensive toolkit for structuring your story, planning scenes, and tracking the progression of your characters.\n\nWhile Sudowrite and Jasper AI provide more versatile writing assistance across various genres and styles, Plot Factory excels in organizing and planning out stories. If you're a writer who struggles with plot development or want to improve your storytelling structure and character development, Plot Factory is the perfect tool for you!\n\nSudowrite Review: Can AI Write Novels That Sound Human?\n\nAfter using Sudowrite's tools to write a novel from start to finish, Sudowrite is more than capable of writing compelling content that sounds human. Although it can't replace actual writing, I would argue that it's still better than what humans can write.\n\nFrom the start, Sudowrite matched my tone of voice and pacing while infusing words I would have never thought of to captivate readers. The AI-powered platform effortlessly weaved together intricate plotlines, compelling characters, and immersive settings. It was like having a co-author who understood and brought my creative vision to life.\n\nBesides the brainstorming tools that helped me develop unique titles, characters, and plotlines, Sudowrite wrote my entire novel without me lifting a finger. All I had to do was indicate what the story was about and the genre. I walked away from my computer, knowing Sudowrite would continue crafting my story with the same creativity and attention to detail. After that, I used Sudowrite's AI editing tools to make the final touches.\n\nI hope you found my review of Sudowrite helpful! Whether you're a beginner writer or a seasoned author, I'm confident Sudowrite will revolutionize your writing process. With its AI-powered tools and seamless integration into your creative vision, Sudowrite offers an experience like no other.

      "# [5 AI creative writing tools by David Burton on 2024-08-16](https://www.artshub.co.uk/news/features/5-ai-creative-writing-tools-2617465/)\nIf you’re ready to embrace the technological future, there’s a diverse range of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for creative writers available. While it’s feasible that AI could write your masterpiece for you, it probably won’t become the next literary award-winner. Overall, AI tools are best used as a means of generating ideas or first drafts, or correcting prose. Embraced in this way, AI can streamline your creative writing process.\n\nWhen considering these tools, it’s essential to know if the work you generate on the platforms will be used to train further AI models or possibly used in ways you didn’t intend. For more on the ethics of creative AI, take a look at the Senate inquiry into AI in Australia, and what concerns by the sector were tabled.\n\nGrammarly\n\nOne of the world’s most popular grammar checkers, Grammarly recently rebranded itself as AI writing assistance. Apart from offering a robust service for basic punctuation and grammar mistakes, Grammarly can use AI to check the tone of your writing and make suggestions. Ideal for professional emails and documents, Grammarly is also rare in its meaningful integration with Office 365 and most internet browsers.\n\nSudowrite\n\nIf nothing else, Sudowrite is a fun toy to play with. Sudowrite is designed for fiction writers. It’s in-browser app has a range of tools, including brainstorming names or locations. But its real thrill is in its Story Bible tool. It will take your unrefined brain dump and turn it into a synopsis, an outline, a chapter and a character breakdown. From there, it can generate a beat-by-beat summary for each chapter and even write it for you.\n\nYou can provide edits and nudges in the desired direction at each step. Sudowrite feels the most like the creative writing techno-dystopia that keeps editors and authors up at night. Still, when handled properly, it is most like a helpful, occasionally dim-witted co-writer. Sudowrite’s pricing is aggressive: a monthly subscription will net you a dedicated amount of AI hints, but you will need to pay extra if you run out. Writing an entire chapter, for example, is an expensive enterprise.\n\nJasper\n\nTaking the lead in blog writing, marketing copy and social media posts, Jasper is constructed to help an organisation with content marketing. It leverages your company’s established brand voice and style guide to begin generating content. It can build a content strategy for you, or work off one you have already created. You can use the Jasper app in-browser, but you can also use the Jasper API directly into code. Many other SEO (search engine optimisation) and content generation AI creative writing tools offer slight variants. Jasper remains one of the most popular.\n\nProWritingAid\n\nGeared towards journalists, academics and authors, ProWritingAid offers unique insight on your early drafts. It is not designed for content generation, but will offer a customised critique of your work, describing strengths, weaknesses and areas for improvement. Fiction writers can receive custom suggestions on plot enhancement, characters, setting and pace. It will also shorten or expand sections while maintaining your authorial voice. Among the spectrum of AI creative writing tools, it is also relatively inexpensive.\n\nRytr",
      "# [9 of the Best AI Writing Tools to Help You Work Smarter, Not Harder](https://buffer.com/resources/ai-writing-tools/)\nFrom brainstorming ideas, creating outlines, repurposing content — AI can make your job as a writer a whole lot easier.\n\nArtificial intelligence is not going to do your best work for you, of course. We know there’s (thankfully?) still work to be done in replicating the weirdness and wonder of human creativity. But AI can take some of the work off your plate, so you can focus on exactly that: creating.\n\nHowever, with the ever-growing list of AI software and tools on the market — all promising to help you generate, streamline, and automate your writing process — it can be tricky to figure out which ones are worth your time (and money).\n\nWhich is where I come in. I’m a productivity nerd who loves testing out new tools, and I’ve put dozens of AI writing assistants to the test in the hope of working smarter, not harder.\n\nMy ultimate goal is to remove the admin and repetition from my to-do list as a writer so I can focus on what brings me joy. (The creating part, as you may have guessed.)\n\nIn this article, I’ll take a deep dive into my favorite AI writing generators and who I think they’ll be most useful for.\n\nBefore we get into that, here is some context on how I use AI tools in my work.\n\nHow I use AI in my work\n\nAt Buffer, our approach to AI is simple: it’s a tool, not a replacement. You’ll never find completely AI-generated content on Buffer’s blog, website, or the product itself — a human reviews everything. (You can read more about how we use AI on the content team here.)\n\nThere are a plethora of ways to use AI tools in your content creation process, but here are some ways I’m using AI as a writer:\n\nGenerate ideas\n\nDraft article outlines\n\nRephrase paragraphs or phrases with a specific tone\n\nGenerate sentences or paragraphs when I’m hit with writer’s block (though I’ll always fact-check, edit, or rewrite these)\n\nRepurpose blog posts into social media posts\n\nWrite silly poems I can share for friends’ birthdays\n\nOK, that last one doesn’t exactly count as work, but it’s one of my favorite ways to use it.\n\nFor all of the above (and a few more tasks), these are the best AI writing tools I’ve tested*.\n\n1. Buffer’s AI Assistant\n\nBest AI writing tool for social media content\n\nBuffer's AI Assistant was built for social media. You can use it as and when you create and schedule your content with Buffer, making the content creation process seamless (no more copy-pasting to various social networks — especially tedious if you’re cross-posting to multiple platforms).\n\nThe best thing about Buffer’s AI Assistant is that it understands the nuances of each social media platform. For example, the content you create for X (formerly Twitter) won’t exceed your character limit. It’s also trained to make the tone of LinkedIn content more professional, Instagram more playful, and so on.\n\nAnother time-saving feature is the editing buttons within the assistant. Instead of having to type further instructions to the Assistant to tweak your post, just click Rephrase, Shorten, Expand, More casual, or More formal to get you closer to the content you’re after.\n\nYou can also use these buttons to tweak certain parts of your posts if you don’t want to rewrite the whole lot — another time saver. (If you’re new to using AI in this way, this beginner’s guide to using AI for social media is a helpful read.)\n\nBeyond these fundamental features, here are some of my favorite use cases as a writer looking to create more content on social media and build my personal brand:\n\nPersonalized ideas\n\nIn my experience as a creator and social media manager, social media writer’s block is SO much worse than the regular kind. Perhaps it’s the sheer volume of content you have to create. Who knows.\n\nMercifully, I’ve found Buffer’s AI Assistant, which means this is a thing of the past. When I’m stuck on what to post, I head over to Buffer’s Create Space (where I brain-dump all my post ideas) and click the Generate Ideas button.\n\nTo get a better sense of what is going to resonate with your audience, the assistant will ask you two things:\n\nWhat is your business about?\n\nWho is your target audience?\n\nFrom there, the Assistant will generate a stream of ideas for you to assess, one at a time. On each one, you’ll be able to hit Use it, which will open a pre-filled post creation window, or Try another to regenerate.\n\nRepurpose other posts and content\n\nOne of the best use cases for this tool is the ability to repurpose content that has performed well or rewrite it to be more appropriate for another platform.\n\nI often use the latter to rework posts I’ve created for LinkedIn into a Twitter thread (something that used to take me ages).\n\nSomething else I’m leaning into right now is repurposing older social media posts into something fresh. There’s a fair chance a huge chunk of my audience missed certain posts, and those who saw them likely won’t remember if they did (especially if the original post has been given a glow-up).\n\nI also use the AI Assistant to summarize entire blog posts I’ve written into bite-sized social snippets — another thing that used to take me ages.\n\nFree and limitless on all Buffer plans\n\nUnlike many other AI writer tools, especially those built for social media, there’s no ‘credits’ system in place. The AI Assistant is free to use, as is Buffer (for up to three channels). When it comes to the number of prompts and rephrases you can submit, the limit does not exist!\n\nBonus: No-sign-up-required Social Media Post Creator\n\nYou don’t need to be a Buffer user to use the AI Assistant. With the free Social Media Post Creator, you can take the tool for a test run (or use it indefinitely) without creating an account or sharing your email address.\n\n2. Jasper\n\nBest AI writing tool for Marketing teams\n\nAs one of the first AI writing tools to market (then known as Jarvis), Jasper has had time to hone its UI and feature set.\n\nAlong with AI text generation for a plethora of specific projects — everything from landing pages to full-on marketing campaigns, Jasper also boasts Remix (a dedicated tool for reworking content via a link, uploaded document, or text), Chat (a back-and-forth chat box with the AI to help you brainstorm or hone ideas), plus a Chrome extension.\n\nJasper has moved beyond just copywriting and now aims squarely at marketing teams. The collaborative features mean everyone can jump into various documents and view projects and campaigns at a glance with nifty Kanban and calendar views. Managers and editors can also add in things like brand voice and style guide documents to ensure things stay on track across all content pieces.\n\nWhen writing, Jasper’s intuitive system will ask you to enter a simple prompt or choose from a list of templates. From there, you’ll be asked for more information upfront, which differs depending on what you’re working on. Before generating your draft, you can add things like your target audience, specific points to include, and more — but the AI can predict these things so well that this usually just involves choosing from some recommended options.\n\nWhile Jasper is intuitive and great for teams, it’s worth noting that the foundation of the tool is the same as most of the other (cheaper) options on this list. Jasper “uses over a dozen language models,” but the marketing copy generated is similar to what you’ll get from ChatGPT and other AI writing software.\n\nPricing: 7-day trial, then prices start at $49 per month\n\n3. Copy.ai\n\nBest AI writing tool for automating repetitive writing tasks\n\nCopy.ai is another tool on this list that has outgrown the content generation mold it was born into. The multifaceted tool aims to help Sales and Marketing teams go from “go-to-market bloat to velocity.”\n\nWhat that means in practice is a slick tool a lot like Jasper. However, Copy.ai places more emphasis on repeatable workflows that will help save marketers (or salespeople) time — think “repurpose this blog post into a LinkedIn post,” “Check this copy for plagiarism,” or “Find prospects at company X.”\n\nYou can choose these workflows from an impressive library or customize your own. The finished product will look something like a flowchart, where each step in the process is effectively an AI prompt (or a series of them).\n\nIf you’re not bothered with workflows, you can jump straight into Chat, their AI content generator. It’s a lot like the usual prompt-and-generate system most AI tools use and requires lots of context to generate what you’re looking for — which is why you might be better off getting the hang of the workflow system.\n\nLike Jasper, you can have Copy.ai assess your content to match your tone and style.\n\nPricing: Free version with limited features, paid plans starting at $49 per month.\n\n4. Writer\n\nBest AI writing tool for editing and improving your content\n\nWriter is a whole lot more than a simple AI text generator. Like Jasper and Copy.ai, the web tool is packed with more powerful features that take the tool beyond what ChatCPT can do — but instead of workflows and systems, they’re called ‘Apps.’\n\nThese apps, all baked into the web application, are things like ‘Blog Builder’ (which will help you spin a blog post up out of a headline idea), ‘Recaps’ (to convert a recording into a summary of key takeaways), and ‘Ask Writer’ (the chat-style prompt-and-generate AI system you’ll be familiar with). You’ll also find apps to help you create product descriptions, push notifications, and help center articles.\n\nIt’s a neat and tidy system that’s a lot easier to get to grips with than Jasper and Copy.ai, and is squarely aimed at writers rather than marketers or sales folk. Writer’s interface, for example, looks a lot like Grammarly. Here, you’ll see suggestions for improving grammar and readability, a plagiarism checker, and recommendations for improving language inclusivity.\n\nWriter is also a solid option for content teams, with a helpful terms list where you can save all your unique terms and saved snippets for copy you reuse often. You can also set specific punctuation rules, which is a helpful time saver for editors. Writing is one of my favorite tools for proofreading and editing existing content.\n\nWhat sets Writer apart from the other copywriting tools on the market is that it’s not built on GPT or other (sometimes controversial) AI models. Writer uses its own Palmyra Language Learning Models, specifically “trained for business writing and business use cases,” offering higher security and transparency. For example, Writer says Palmyra does not store your proprietary data for training its foundational models.\n\nThat said, many of Writer’s most powerful tools — like the ability to add your own brand and style guide — are locked behind its enterprise-level paywall.\n\nPricing: 14-day free trial, then prices start at $18 per month. (There is a free plan, but it doesn’t allow much beyond text editing.)\n\n5. Hubspot Breeze\n\nBest AI writing tool to streamline business operations\n\nThink of HubSpot Breeze as the Swiss Army knife of AI tools. The platform helps marketers, sales reps, and customer service agents take out most of the grunt work that comes with their activities and boost their productivity.\n\nHubSpot Breeze handles anything from writing quick emails and social captions down to more complex tasks like generating website pages and summarizing CRM data into digestible reports. The way it does this is through Breeze Agents — think of them as separate AI assistants, each specialized in its own department.\n\nFor example, the Content Agent generates blogs, landing pages, podcasts, and anything else content-related. Meanwhile, the Breeze Customer Agent handles basic customer service inquiries, offers reply suggestions, and compiles customer service data into visual reports.\n\nThere’s also the Breeze Co-pilot, which does a little bit of everything — it can update CRM records, generate content, and summarize customer support tickets, for example.\n\nPricing: Breeze is available in HubSpot’s free starter suite as well as throughout HubSpot’s premium product offerings. Paid pricing starts at $15 per user per month.\n\n6. Sudowrite\n\nBest AI writing tool for creative writing and fiction\n\nIf, like me, you’ve been threatening to write a novel for years, Sudowrite may soon become your new best friend. Not only will Sudowrite help you generate ideas and write stories for the characters you’ve had floating around in your head for years, but it’s also an AI-powered project management tool of sorts specifically designed for fiction writers.\n\nAs for the writing itself, you’ll start by entering the genre of your masterpiece-in-progress, then get cracking on the draft. Instead of entering a prompt, start by entering what you have. With a few sentences to start a chapter, click the ‘Write’ button, and the AI generator will suggest several options to keep moving the story forward. Highlight a word or phrase and hit ‘Describe’ to generate a description of the object based on each of the senses or a metaphor.\n\nThere’s also a ‘Rewrite’ button to help you paraphrase or rework something and a ‘Brainstorm’ button to help get your creative juices flowing in specific directions, from characters to world-building to plot points.\n\nIf you’re not ready to jump right into chapter 1, you might want to play around with Sudowrite’s Story Engine, a space where you can go into more detail about your genre, characters, and outline, add more writing samples to help the AI match your style or just brain dump ideas.\n\nThen there’s Sudowrite’s Canvas – a space for mind mapping your (and the AI’s) imaginings to give you a bird’s-eye view (and keep track of) the story you’re creating.\n\nSudowrite also boasts a handy Google Docs extension so you can work where you write best and a bustling Slack community of other Sudowrite users so you can bounce ideas off of humans from time to time.\n\nPricing: Credit-based free trial (for a certain amount of words generated), then prices start at $10 per month\n\n7. Type\n\nBest AI writing tool for a simple AI writing assistant\n\nType describes itself as an AI-first document editor. With the tool, you can create short and long-form content, from emails to YouTube scripts to cover letters.\n\nThe interface — clean and user-friendly — requires you to begin with a simple prompt to get you started. There’s a template library to tap into, which is handy for those moments when you just can’t face staring at a blank page (we’ve all been there). From there, Type will generate a high-quality content draft, which you’re then encouraged to play with and make your own.\n\nType’s generative AI makes it really easy to do this with a host of different options — for example, you can switch between OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude 3. “Claude tends to be more creative and expressive but not quite as good at complex reasoning, whereas the GPT models are often much better at reasoning, but maybe a bit drier with tone,” Type Founder Stew Fortier explains in an onboarding video.\n\nThere’s also the ‘What to write about next’ block, a handy springboard for anything you might want to add. The sidebar contains a list of suggestions related to whatever you’re working on that you can use to generate another paragraph. In the main editor, you can also- highlight specific sentences, paragraphs, or phrases and ask Type to rework them for you.\n\nAll the common options are available, but ‘Custom transform’ is particularly handy, allowing you to ask the AI to do something really specific with your highlighted text.\n\nPricing: 14 days free, then $29.00 per month.\n\n8. SEOWind\n\nBest AI writing tool for SEO content briefs\n\nSEOWind is not a multi-purpose tool like many of the others on this — it’s laser-focused SEO (search-engine optimized) content, making it a great tool for content marketing.\n\nAs such, SEOWind doesn’t ask you to enter a prompt to kick-start your writing but a primary search term. From there, it’ll jump you to a fascinating dashboard that analyzes blog posts and pages already ranking for this term to help you create your ‘brief.’\n\nIn this build-you-brief dashboard, you’ll see a competitor analysis (an overview of blog posts and pages already ranking in Google for your term), competitor outlines (the structure of their content), and questions to answer (related queries pulled from Google, Quora and Reddit). Along with this, the tool recommends the ideal word count, the number of headings, and even the number of images to include.\n\nWith this information at your fingertips, you can set about pulling bits and pieces to create your own brief, from which SEOWind’s AI will generate a draft for you to download in your format of choice — from there, you’re left to edit the article on your own. While SEOWind makes briefs super customizable, there’s no way to edit and rework with AI once your draft is generated.\n\nAll briefs are saved within projects, where SEOWind encourages you to add details about your brand tone, details about your company and products, and even integrates with Google Search Console to help you find internal linking opportunities (one of the more tedious tick-boxes in SEO writing for sure!).\n\nPricing: 7-day trial, then prices start at $59 per month.\n\n9. ChatGPT\n\nBest free AI writing tool\n\nYou might be surprised to find ChatGPT in and amongst some of its more niche competitors, but I’d be remiss not to mention it here. As a free AI writing tool (for GPT-3, at least), ChatGPT is one I keep returning to for quick ideas, blog post outlines, and goofy metaphors.\n\nChatGPT, a chatbot based on Open AI’s GPT model, is what many of the bells-and-whistle-filled tools above are built on and what helps generate the copy that lands in their fancy interfaces.\n\nLearning to prompt ChatGPT takes some doing — I tend to err on the side of providing as much context as possible — but the chat-style interface can be helpful as you refine your ask and tweak prompts as you go.\n\nPricing: Free for the basic version, with paid plans starting at $10 per month\n\nWhile I’ve tested many AI writing generators, I’m not an AI myself and, as such, can’t test them all. (In case you’re wondering, that cheesy simile was all mine.)\n\nIf there’s a tool out there that I have to put through its paces, I’d love to hear about it! Please comment below or tag @buffer or @bufferapp on all major social channels, and I’ll put your favorite tool to the test.",
      "# [The Ultimate Showdown: Novelcrafter vs Sudowrite on 2024-02-25](https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/the-ultimate-showdown-novelcrafter-vs-sudowrite-1917766)\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nEase of Use\n\nPSE sudoite\n\nNovel Crafter\n\nTailored for Authors\n\nPSE sudoite\n\nNovel Crafter\n\nCommunity\n\nPSE sudoite\n\nNovel Crafter\n\nStory Bible\n\nPSE sudoite\n\nNovel Crafter\n\nIn-Text Editing\n\nPSE sudoite\n\nNovel Crafter\n\nFull Chapter Generation\n\nPSE sudoite\n\nNovel Crafter\n\nCustomization\n\nPSE sudoite\n\nNovel Crafter\n\nPricing\n\nPSE sudoite\n\nNovel Crafter\n\nConclusion\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the world of ai writing tools, PSE sudoite and Novel Crafter have risen to the top. While both offer features for fiction authors, there are notable differences between the two. In this article, we will compare and evaluate the two tools in terms of ease of use, tailored authorship, community, story bible handling, in-text editing, full chapter generation, customization, and pricing. By examining each category, we will determine which tool is better suited for authors in their pursuit of using AI to write fiction.\n\nEase of Use\n\nPSE sudoite: When it comes to ease of use, PSE sudoite provides a relatively straightforward user interface. The instructions are clear, and after familiarizing oneself with the tool, it becomes easy to navigate. From brainstorming to creating a story bible, PSE sudoite simplifies the process and allows authors to easily input their ideas. However, some features, such as the brainstorming section, may not be as useful for authors seeking more advanced prompts.\n\nNovel Crafter: Novel Crafter offers a more robust user interface with a wider range of options and features. While this may initially appear overwhelming, it provides greater customization and flexibility for authors. The \"Chat\" feature, in particular, stands out as a valuable tool for bouncing ideas back and forth with the AI. Novel Crafter understands the specific needs of authors, and its interface is tailored to meet those needs. The inclusion of a Codex section for character development and the ability to export different elements of the project also contribute to its usability.\n\nOverall, both PSE sudoite and Novel Crafter have their strengths in terms of ease of use. While PSE sudoite may be simpler for beginners, Novel Crafter offers more advanced features and a better understanding of author requirements.\n\nTailored for Authors\n\nPSE sudoite: PSE sudoite labels itself as a tool created by authors for authors. However, it becomes evident that the developers may not have the same level of investment in the author community as expected. The brainstorming feature, for example, lacks the back-and-forth interaction that is crucial for effective brainstorming. Additionally, the limited space for characters in the story bible may be a hindrance.\n\nNovel Crafter: In contrast, Novel Crafter demonstrates a deep understanding of the author community. Its features are designed to meet the specific needs of authors, such as the inclusion of the Codex section for characters, locations, and objects. The ability to add notes and tailored prompts further showcases its commitment to providing a tool that is truly tailor-made for authors.\n\nIn terms of catering to authors, Novel Crafter outshines PSE sudoite by offering a more comprehensive and well-thought-out approach.\n\nCommunity\n\nPSE sudoite: PSE sudoite has a supportive and active community that is accessible through its Discord server. Users can seek tips, ask questions, and find new ways to utilize the tool. While the community is helpful, it should be noted that the founders may not have the same degree of passion for authorship as expected.\n\nNovel Crafter: Novel Crafter also boasts an active and wholesome community accessible through its Discord server. The community includes developers, ambassadors, and fellow users who are all willing to provide assistance and guidance. The community support extends beyond Novel Crafter itself, as they actively engage in discussions related to other AI writing tools as well.\n\nBoth PSE sudoite and Novel Crafter have thriving communities, making it a tie in this category.\n\nStory Bible\n\nPSE sudoite: PSE sudoite offers a story bible section where authors can input background information about their novels, including characters. However, it should be noted that the story bible in PSE sudoite is limited to characters and lacks the ability to include other crucial elements such as locations, objects, or lore. This limitation may restrict the overall usefulness of the story bible tool.\n\nNovel Crafter: Novel Crafter provides the Codex section, which encompasses not only characters but also locations, objects, lore, and more. This comprehensive approach allows authors to input all the necessary information for their world-building process. Additionally, the ability to add notes and tags further enhances the usability of the Codex.\n\nIn terms of story bible handling, Novel Crafter surpasses PSE sudoite by providing a more expansive and feature-rich tool.\n\nIn-Text Editing\n\nPSE sudoite: Both PSE sudoite and Novel Crafter offer the ability to edit text within the platform. PSE sudoite provides options such as rewriting, describing, and expanding the selected text. While these options may be useful for brainstorming purposes, they may not offer significant benefits for actual fiction writing.\n\nNovel Crafter: Novel Crafter allows users to expand, rephrase, and edit text through various models. The platform provides more flexibility and customization options, ensuring that authors can fine-tune their writing to their satisfaction.\n\nBoth platforms offer similar functionality in terms of in-text editing. However, Novel Crafter's additional options and customization capabilities make it a slightly better choice for authors seeking more control over their writing.\n\nFull Chapter Generation\n\nPSE sudoite: PSE sudoite allows users to generate full chapters at once by inputting scene beats. While this feature may seem convenient, it often leads to the AI veering off track and requires significant editing to ensure coherence and consistency throughout the chapter.\n\nNovel Crafter: Novel Crafter takes a different approach to chapter generation. By breaking down the chapter into scene beats and generating them individually, the platform provides better readability and allows authors to edit and refine their writing along the way. This method ensures that the AI remains consistent and aligned with the author's style and intent.\n\nAlthough full chapter generation is possible in both platforms, Novel Crafter's approach offers more control and better overall results.\n\nCustomization\n\nPSE sudoite: PSE sudoite offers the option to customize prompts through plugins. Users can create their own prompts or use prompts created by others. While this feature enhances customization, it falls short in terms of modifying the existing prompts provided by PSE sudoite.\n\nNovel Crafter: Novel Crafter excels in customization, allowing users to modify prompts, adjust various settings, and access a wide range of models through OpenAI's API integration.

      "# [AI is Not the Writer’s Enemy by Harley Austin, medium.harleyaustin.com on 2024-02-24](https://medium.harleyaustin.com/ai-is-not-the-writers-enemy-45b03145737b)\nAI is Not Really the Enemy—Scammers Are\n\nLast year I wrote an article about an AI tool that really impressed me with its ability to proofread my chapters. Note that I did not say it “wrote” my chapters. Most of us as real authors despise those kinds of tools.\n\nUnfortunately, these “write it for you” tools are popping up everywhere now. Not a day goes by that I don’t see some social media ad for a new AI tool that promises to make me a bestselling author by writing my book FOR me.\n\nAmazon is now flooded with millions of junk books written by AI and published by people who cannot write, but who bought into some scammer’s $37 “system” for getting rich on Amazon by using AI to write a worthless book no one would want to actually buy.\n\nNeedless to say, AI has left a really bad taste in the mouths of real authors and writers who spend years of our lives honing our craft, only to be overshadowed in the marketplace by people who cannot write their way out of a wet paper bag.\n\nBut this is the new world we live in as AI emerges front and center into our strange and ever-changing new world.\n\nThe AI Tools Worth Writing About\n\nThat being said, AI is not really our enemy; scammers promising quick riches to gullible people are, but that’s an article for another time.\n\nThe AI proofreading tool I wrote about last year worked well, but it was rather rudimentary in how it worked. Mostly it was because I couldn’t actually see the changes the tool made to my text it had corrected. Also, there was no way to preserve formatting, curly quotes, etc. It was a very basic tool.\n\nFast-forward a few months and I have discovered a bevy of new AI writing tools thanks to social media. I am going to briefly review a few of them here, but mostly I’m going to focus on the one that is really the easiest of the four to use.\n\nWhat’s the cost?\n\nMost of these tools all cost about the same, about $10 to $20 per month, and all of them charge you in some fashion by the number of words you process. There are some that don’t charge by usage, but they are much more pricey per month to use—or the tool itself is a scam.\n\nScammers sell you a one-time or “lifetime” subscription for $59 to $149 or whatever, which is an unsustainable business model for any usage-based business. At some point, when the expenses exceed their Ponzi-scheme revenues, the company and your money will disappear forever.\n\nIf you see a writing tool promising a “lifetime” or one-time purchase option, run. It’s a scam.\n\nAll these tools are using one or more versions of OpenAI’s ChatGPT AI engine under the hood. What makes them better than just trying to use your own OpenAI account directly are their writing and editing features that OpenAI doesn’t offer.\n\nAlso, one of the benefits of using OpenAI under the hood is that they don’t use (ie. plagiarize) our work to train their models. As of March of 2023, OpenAI announced that they will NOT be training their models using user-entered content. This is GREAT news for us as authors and writers!\n\nSo let’s take a look at these tools, in reverse order of my pet personal preference. You can then decide which of these might work best for you.\n\n3. AutoCrit\n\nWhile AutoCrit has been around for a few years, I’ve only been seeing their ads since last year. Like Sudowrite, AutoCrit’s “creative studio” feature can do a deep-dive into helping you prompt the AI with all kinds of terms as it literally rewrites your chapters for you.\n\nBut AutoCrit is much more than just AI. It’s an entire writing platform.\n\nWhat turned me off about AutoCrit was that it attempts to take over my entire writing process with its own “process”. Huh? Look, I just want to write my book, not insert myself into some massive framework that leads me by the nose into taking over every step of my writing and publishing. Does it blow my nose too?\n\nAutoCrit is a “plotter’s” dream come true, and a “pantser’s” worst nightmare.\n\nWhile AutoCrit is a well-polished product, it does WAY too much. And all that hand-holding comes with a price tag. AutoCrit is by far the most expensive of all these tools. But if you need this level of hand-holding, encouragement, feedback, and nose-wiping to write a novel, then maybe this tool is for you. I’m much too type-A, much too free-spirited, to be using a nit-picky style-rating tool like this. Get out of my way, I just want to write.\n\n1. PowerWord AI\n\nThe tool I liked the best was PowerWord. Written by authors for authors, PowerWord is by far the more easy-to-use and polished of these tools and the one that least got in my way during proofreading and editing.\n\nWhat I liked best was how PowerWord shows you your original text in one window while letting you compare what the AI changed in a companion window. You can then scroll through the linked windows and see the changes that the AI made, then edit the results. Boom! Done.\n\nI also liked how PowerWord let me select between light and dark screen modes, and between serif and san-serif font faces in the edit windows. Those are subtle but nice touches.\n\nWhile all of these tools basically charge by the number of words you process, because that’s how OpenAI bills for their service, PowerWord was by far the least expensive to get started. You can start with as little as $5 to buy words on a pay-as-you-go basis, or you can sign up for a subscription starting at just $5 per month for double the number of words. PowerWord also doesn’t scam you into a lower monthly rate by making you pay annually either. That was refreshing to see.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was that PowerWord seemed to understand how I want to work. You can tell these people are actual authors themselves because the tool gets out of your way and just lets you work like a real writer would. For me, I just want to paste my chapter into the tool, click proofread, see what got changed, then copy the corrected text back into Word and move on. That’s exactly how PowerWord lets me work. It gets the job done quickly and efficiently without a bunch of bells and whistles and other editor noise getting in the way.\n\nMost impressively, PowerWord didn’t change my text formatting. Curly quotes, italics, bold, all of it was still there. PowerWord was also able to correct emphasis on words that needed emphasis where before I hadn’t used it. Wow.\n\nLike the other tools, PowerWord lets me proofread, analyze, summarize, and even rewrite paragraphs using different genres, if I need. It would be a great tool for editors too. In fact, anyone who writes would benefit from using this tool.\n\nAnother thing PowerWord did was get out of my way so that I could just use ChatGPT conversationally. No need to pull up another window. Just click the Chat link and I was off and running asking for some info on the topic I was writing about.\n\nPowerWord was also the only tool I saw that offered translating. You can translate an entire novel into multiple languages. And the translation is quite good. Of course, it’s not going to be as good as a native writer in whatever language, but several of my Spanish-speaking friends were impressed with how well the tool translated English to Spanish. It does a good job of translating dialects too. When translating American English into British, I noticed native idioms I’ve never even seen before.\n\nThe Limitations of AI\n\nNow for the caveats—if you’re a romance author, expect to see these tools tone-down your steamy love scenes. Most of the AI engines out there eschew NSFW (not safe for work) prose. If you’re editing a steamy-hot love scene using any of these tools, you will need to do a bit more manual editing, as the AI returns a kind of Biblical purple prose you probably won’t appreciate, or it lets you know you just violated its terms of service.\n\nAnother gotcha was the AI “temperature” or what PowerWord calls the “creative” level you want the AI to use. I got the best results when keeping the creative temperature on its next to lowest settings. Otherwise you get prose that reads like the AI is on LSD.\n\nFinally, just keep in mind that while these tools are really good, they are not perfect. You still need to manually edit some of what the AI generates. The AI often got wordy on rewrites, attempting to create new parts of the story I didn’t need it adding.\n\nNone of them were perfect, but they will save you time, a lot of time, editing and proofreading with a high level of accuracy you just won't get trying to do it yourself.",
