      "# [Robotics: What Are Robots? by Sam Daley on 2019-04-12](https://builtin.com/robotics)\nRobotics is an interdisciplinary sector of science and engineering dedicated to the design, construction and use of mechanical robots. Our guide will give you a concrete grasp of robotics, including different types of robots and how they’re being applied across industries.\n\nWhat Is Robotics?\n\nRobotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that produces machines, called robots, that replicate or substitute for human actions. Robots perform basic and repetitive tasks with greater efficiency and accuracy than humans, making them ideal for industries like manufacturing. However, the introduction of artificial intelligence in robotics has given robots the ability to handle increasingly complex situations in various industries.\n\nWhat Is a Robot?\n\nA robot is a programmable machine that can complete a task, while the term robotics describes the field of study focused on developing robots and automation. Each robot has a different level of autonomy. These levels range from human-controlled bots that carry out tasks to fully-autonomous bots that perform tasks without any external influences.\n\nIn terms of etymology, the word ‘robot’ is derived from the Czech word robota, which means “forced labor.” The word first appeared in the 1920 play R.U.R., in reference to the play’s characters who were mass-produced workers incapable of creative thinking.\n\nRobotics Aspects\n\nMechanical Construction\n\nThe mechanical aspect of a robot helps it complete tasks in the environment for which it’s designed. For example, the Mars 2020 Rover’s wheels are individually motorized and made of titanium tubing that help it firmly grip the harsh terrain of the red planet.\n\nElectrical Components\n\nRobots need electrical components that control and power the machinery. Essentially, an electric current — a battery, for example — is needed to power a large majority of robots.\n\nSoftware Program\n\nRobots contain at least some level of computer programming. Without a set of code telling it what to do, a robot would just be another piece of simple machinery. Inserting a program into a robot gives it the ability to know when and how to carry out a task.\n\nWhat Are the Main Components of a Robot?\n\nControl System\n\nComputation includes all of the components that make up a robot’s central processing unit, often referred to as its control system. Control systems are programmed to tell a robot how to utilize its specific components, similar in some ways to how the human brain sends signals throughout the body, in order to complete a specific task. These robotic tasks could comprise anything from minimally invasive surgery to assembly line packing.\n\nSensors\n\nSensors provide a robot with stimuli in the form of electrical signals that are processed by the controller and allow the robot to interact with the outside world. Common sensors found within robots include video cameras that function as eyes, photoresistors that react to light and microphones that operate like ears. These sensors allow the robot to capture its surroundings and process the most logical conclusion based on the current moment and allows the controller to relay commands to the additional components.\n\nActuators\n\nA device can only be considered to be a robot if it has a movable frame or body. Actuators are the components that are responsible for this movement. These components are made up of motors that receive signals from the control system and move in tandem to carry out the movement necessary to complete the assigned task. Actuators can be made of a variety of materials, such as metal or elastic, and are commonly operated by use of compressed air (pneumatic actuators) or oil (hydraulic actuators) but come in a variety of formats to best fulfill their specialized roles.\n\nPower Supply\n\nLike the human body requires food in order to function, robots require power. Stationary robots, such as those found in a factory, may run on AC power through a wall outlet but more commonly, robots operate via an internal battery. Most robots utilize lead-acid batteries for their safe qualities and long shelf life while others may utilize the more compact but also more expensive silver-cadmium variety. Safety, weight, replaceability and lifecycle are all important factors to consider when designing a robot’s power supply.\n\nSome potential power sources for future robotic development also include pneumatic power from compressed gasses, solar power, hydraulic power, flywheel energy storage organic garbage through anaerobic digestion and nuclear power.\n\nEnd Effectors\n\nEnd effectors are the physical, typically external components that allow robots to finish carrying out their tasks. Robots in factories often have interchangeable tools like paint sprayers and drills, surgical robots may be equipped with scalpels and other kinds of robots can be built with gripping claws or even hands for tasks like deliveries, packing, bomb diffusion and much more.\n\nHow Do Robots Work?\n\nSome robots are pre-programmed to perform specific functions, meaning they operate in a controlled environment where they do simple, monotonous tasks — like a mechanical arm on an automotive assembly line.\n\nOther robots are autonomous, operating independently of human operators to carry out tasks in open environments. In order to work, they use sensors to perceive the world around them, and then employ decision-making structures (usually a computer) to take the optimal next step based on their data and mission.\n\nRobots may also work by using wireless networks to enable human control from a safe distance. These teleoperated robots usually work in extreme geographical conditions, weather and circumstances. Examples of teleoperated robots are the human-controlled submarines used to fix underwater pipe leaks during the BP oil spill or drones used to detect landmines on a battlefield.\n\nTypes of Robotics\n\nHumanoid Robots\n\nHumanoid robots are robots that look like or mimic human behavior. These robots usually perform human-like activities (like running, jumping and carrying objects), and are sometimes designed to look like us, even having human faces and expressions. Two of the most prominent examples of humanoid robots are Hanson Robotics’ Sophia and Boston Dynamics’ Atlas.\n\nCobots\n\nCobots, or collaborative robots, are robots designed to work alongside humans. These robots prioritize safety by using sensors to remain aware of their surroundings, executing slow movements and ceasing actions when their movements are obstructed. Cobots typically perform simple tasks, freeing up humans to address more complex work.\n\nIndustrial Robots\n\nIndustrial robots automate processes in manufacturing environments like factories and warehouses. Possessing at least one robotic arm, these robots are made to handle heavy objects while moving with speed and precision. As a result, industrial robots often work in assembly lines to boost productivity.\n\nMedical Robots\n\nMedical robots assist healthcare professionals in various scenarios and support the physical and mental health of humans. These robots rely on AI and sensors to navigate healthcare facilities, interact with humans and execute precise movements. Some medical robots can even converse with humans, encouraging people’s social and emotional growth.\n\nAgricultural Robots\n\nAgricultural robots handle repetitive and labor-intensive tasks, allowing farmers to use their time and energy more efficiently. These robots also operate in greenhouses, where they monitor crops and help with harvests. Agricultural robots come in many forms, ranging from autonomous tractors to drones that collect data for farmers to analyze.\n\nMicrorobotics\n\nMicrorobotics is the study and development of robots on a miniature scale. Often no bigger than a millimeter, microrobots can vary in size, depending on the situation. Biotech researchers typically use microrobotics to monitor and treat diseases, with the goal of improving diagnostic tools and creating more targeted solutions.\n\nAugmenting Robots\n\nAugmenting robots, also known as VR robots, either enhance current human capabilities or replace the capabilities a human may have lost. The field of robotics for human augmentation is a field where science fiction could become reality very soon, with bots that have the ability to redefine the definition of humanity by making humans faster and stronger. Some examples of current augmenting robots are robotic prosthetic limbs or exoskeletons used to lift hefty weights.\n\nSoftware Bots\n\nSoftware bots, or simply ‘bots,’ are computer programs which carry out tasks autonomously. They are not technically considered robots. One common use case of software robots is a chatbot, which is a computer program that simulates conversation both online and over the phone and is often used in customer service scenarios. Chatbots can either be simple services that answer questions with an automated response or more complex digital assistants that learn from user information.\n\nRobotics Applications\n\nBeginning as a major boon for manufacturers, robotics has become a mainstay technology for a growing number of industries.\n\nManufacturing\n\nIndustrial robots can assemble products, sort items, perform welds and paint objects. They may even be used to fix and maintain other machines in a factory or warehouse.\n\nHealthcare\n\nMedical robots transport medical supplies, perform surgical procedures and offer emotional support to those going through rehabilitation.\n\nCompanionship\n\nSocial robots can support children with learning disabilities and act as a therapeutic tool for people with dementia. They also have business applications like providing in-person customer service in hotels and moving products around warehouses.\n\nHome Use\n\nConsumers may be most familiar with the Roomba and other robot vacuum cleaners. However, other home robots include lawn-mowing robots and personal robot assistants that can play music, engage with children and help with household chores.\n\nSearch and Rescue\n\nSearch and rescue robots can save those stuck in flood waters, deliver supplies to those stranded in remote areas and put out fires when conditions become too extreme for firefighters.\n\nPros and Cons of Robotics\n\nRobotics comes with a number of benefits and drawbacks.\n\nPros of Robotics\n\nIncreased accuracy. Robots can perform movements and actions with greater precision and accuracy than humans.\n\nEnhanced productivity. Robots can work at a faster pace than humans and don’t get tired, leading to more consistent and higher-volume production.\n\nImproved safety. Robots can take on tasks and operate in environments unsafe for humans, protecting workers from injuries.\n\nRapid innovation. Many robots are equipped with sensors and cameras that collect data, so teams can quickly refine processes.\n\nGreater cost-efficiency. Gains in productivity may make robots a more cost-efficient option for businesses compared to hiring more human workers.\n\nCons of Robotics\n\nJob losses. Robotic process automation may put human employees out of work, especially those who don’t have the skills to adapt to a changing workplace.\n\nLimited creativity. Robots may not react well to unexpected situations since they don’t have the same problem-solving skills as humans.\n\nData security risks. Robots can be hit with cyber attacks, potentially exposing large amounts of data if they’re connected to the Internet of Things.\n\nMaintenance costs. Robots can be expensive to repair and maintain, and faulty equipment can lead to disruptions in production and revenue losses.\n\nEnvironmental waste. Extracting raw materials to build robots and having to discard disposable parts can lead to more environmental waste and pollution.\n\nFuture of Robotics\n\nThe evolution of AI has major implications for the future of robotics. In factories, AI can be combined with robotics to produce digital twins and design simulations to help companies improve their workflows. Advanced AI also gives robots increased autonomy. For example, drones could deliver packages to customers without any human intervention. In addition, robots could be outfitted with generative AI tools like ChatGPT, resulting in more complex human-robot conversations.\n\nAs robots’ intelligence has shifted, so too have their appearances. Humanoid robots are designed to visually appeal to humans in various settings while understanding and responding to emotions, carrying objects and navigating environments. With these forms and abilities, robots can become major contributors in customer service, manufacturing, logistics and healthcare, among other industries.\n\nWhile the spread of robotics has stoked fears over job losses due to automation, robots could simply change the nature of human jobs. Humans may find themselves collaborating with robots, letting their robotic counterparts handle repetitive tasks while they focus on more difficult problems. Either way, humans will need to adapt to the presence of robots as robotics continues to progress alongside other technologies like AI and deep learning.\n\nHistory of Robotics\n\nRobotics as a concept goes back to ancient times. The ancient Greeks combined automation and engineering to create the Antikythera, a handheld device that predicted eclipses. Centuries later, Leonardo Da Vinci designed a mechanical knight now known as “Leonardo’s Robot.” But it was the rise of manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution that highlighted the need for widespread automation.\n\nFollowing William Grey Walter’s development of the first autonomous robots in 1948, George Devol created the first industrial robotic arm known as Unimate. It began operating at a GM facility in 1959. In 1972, the Stanford Research Institute designed Shakey — the first AI-powered robot. Shakey used cameras and sensors to collect data from its surroundings and inform its next moves.\n\nThe ability of robots to perceive their surroundings led researchers to explore whether they could also perceive human emotions. In the late 1990s, MIT’s Dr. Cynthia Breazeal built Kismet, a robotic head that used facial features to express and respond to human emotions. This predecessor to social robots opened the door for future robots like Roomba and consumer-centric inventions like Alexa and other voice assistants.\n\nRobots took another leap forward in 2012 due to a breakthrough in deep learning. Armed with volumes of digital images, British AI expert Geoffrey Hinton and his team successfully trained a system of neural networks to sort over one million images while making few errors. Since then, companies have incorporated deep learning into their technologies, promising more possibilities for robotics.\n\n1700s\n\n(1737) Jacques de Vaucanson builds the first biomechanical automaton on record.

      "# [What Is Logistics? Logistics Definition and Examples.](https://builtin.com/logistics)\nWhat Is Logistics?\n\nLogistics is the process of coordinating how goods and products are obtained, stored and distributed. Manufacturers rely on logistics while overseeing complex operations in order to maintain efficiency, reduce costs and ensure that consumers’ needs are met.\n\nDue to the prominence of e-commerce companies, like Amazon, logistics embodies more than the actual movement of products from one place to another.\n\nLogistics Definition\n\nLogistics refers to the process of managing resources, including how they are transported, stored and received. Logistics often goes hand in hand with the global supply chain.\n\nAn important part of logistics is the steps taken in order to maximize customer satisfaction. This includes elements such as demand planning, order fulfillment, inventory management and customer service operations. These elements ensure that the goods consumers need are stocked and orders are fulfilled in a timely manner.\n\nLogistics management software has aided the expansion of what the logistics industry entails and how goods are brought to consumers. Some examples of software for the logistics industry include transportation management systems, enterprise resource planning software, yard management systems and warehouse management systems. The growth of this technology has created a need for specialized roles and companies focused on building and implementing logistics software.\n\nAs technology continues to transform our world, its influence on the logistics industry will only become greater, prompting a shift in how companies quickly and efficiently deliver their products to consumers.\n\nSupply Chain Management vs. Logistics\n\nSupply chain management and logistics are often thought of as one in the same, but the terms actually capture two distinct parts of what it means to move resources.\n\nSupply chain management is the larger network that connects global vendors, transportation companies, distributors and warehouses. This network functions as the framework that logistics works under.\n\nLogistics is the process companies undertake to deliver goods to consumers. This process involves purchasing and delivering materials, packaging and shipping goods as well as transporting goods and products to distributors.\n\nWhy Logistics Is Important\n\nLogistics may not be the first thing that comes to mind when a purchase is made online or in a brick-and-mortar store, but it is undeniably intertwined with everything we buy. Logistical considerations affect global supply chains, what items are in stock and when as well as where manufacturers chose to build their facilities. These influences are just one way that logistics displays importance in our global economy.\n\nUtilizing logistics properly is essential to the function of businesses across the globe — and effectively managed logistics typically leads to positive business outcomes. With the growing complexity of the global supply chain, properly implemented and managed logistics are more important than ever.\n\nThe importance of logistics also stretches to simplifying communication and reducing costs. Effective logistics help foster relationships between suppliers, shipping services and warehousers through automated systems. The connectivity of logistics improves delivery and fulfillment of orders, which in turn reduces overhead costs. Costs are also reduced by the ability to use logistical systems to purchase goods based on supply forecasts and improved inventory management.\n\nBest Logistics Companies Hiring for Open RolesView Top Logistics Companies Hiring Now\n\nTypes of Logistics\n\nThe logistics industry has transformed over the past century. During the 1960s, the supply chain was indelibly changed when IBM developed the world’s first computerized inventory management and forecasting system, which made it simpler to track orders, inventory and distribution. Since then, the industry has been propelled even further into the future, bringing with it an entirely new perspective on how we exchange goods across the globe.\n\nTypes of Logistics Companies\n\ne-Commerce logistics\n\nFreight logistics\n\nThird-party logistics\n\nCarrier logistics\n\nFreight forwarders\n\nToday, the logistics realm is heavily influenced by AI and machine learning, which many logistics companies use to offer more accurate forecasting and enhanced order management. With these technological advances and more, the supply chain has been given the chance to prosper worldwide.\n\nLogistics in e-Commerce\n\nGiven the rise of e-commerce and the rapid growth of the online ordering space, logistics has become one of the world’s fastest-growing industries. Many organizations have emerged in response to logistics’ continuous transformation, dedicated to optimizing the supply chain in unimaginable ways. Perhaps the most well-known logistics leader to have emerged over the past few decades is e-commerce giant Amazon. While Amazon was initially founded as an online marketplace for books, the company has become a household name across the globe, altering the way in which products are transported and delivered to consumers.\n\nAmazon has become famous for its logistics strategy, which is made possible by the company’s global network of distribution, sortation and fulfillment centers. Amazon’s same-day and next-day delivery model rests on a complex logistics framework. Products are delivered to the company’s fulfillment centers before being moved to sortation centers. Once goods have made it through Amazon’s sortation centers, they are loaded onto a wide range of transportation modes, which can include the company’s own fleet of delivery trucks and airplanes.\n\nThird-Party Logistics\n\nAmazon has entirely redefined the logistics landscape, yet it’s not the only major third party logistics (3PL) provider making waves. Companies like UPS and FedEx have played a significant role in the transformation of logistics. These companies are capable of transporting goods from their point of origin, warehousing products and packaging them. Working with 3PL providers offers numerous advantages for both small and large businesses including the ability to obtain better rates, easily expand into new markets and improve customer service.\n\nLogistics in Freight Shipping\n\nWhile 3PL providers are capable of handling the entirety of a company’s supply chain operations, the different components of the logistics process can be carried out by individual players. For instance, freight companies solely handle the physical transportation of goods, while freight forwarders are dedicated to optimizing transport solutions and handling necessary documentation. In this sense, logistics could be seen as a complex web of moving parts, which operate in tandem with one another in order to boost efficiency and reduce costs within the supply chain.\n\nBy way of example, Flexport has developed an operating model designed to simplify global freight forwarding, while Transfix has created a marketplace that connects shippers with a national network of carriers.\n\nRead NextFragmented Tech Is the Way Forward in Hospitality\n\nLogistic Tech Developments\n\nGiven the logistics industry’s seemingly endless transformation, logistics management is naturally made up of many different elements. These components include the planning, procurement and coordination of manufacturing materials, strategizing the development of a product and reclaiming materials and supplies involved in the manufacturing of a product. For logistics managers, keeping track of the many different aspects of a supply chain can be nearly impossible. Luckily, logistics tech has successfully reshaped the industry, turning it into a robust sector fueled by the rise of innovative new technologies.\n\nTop Logistics Tech Companies\n\nFourKites\n\nproject44\n\nMotive\n\nZipline\n\nFlexport\n\nTransfix\n\nArrive Logistics\n\nAI and Optimization in Logistics\n\nAs the demand for online delivery grows and consumers’ expectations become larger, the need to optimize logistics has never been greater. As a result, software developers have set to work creating platforms designed to make the supply chain more manageable. Real-time visibility software providers such as FourKites, project44 and FreightVerify empower supply chain operators to simply identify issues and quickly resolve them, saving organizations huge amounts of time during which they can focus on other aspects of the logistics process. Likewise, fleet management company Motive has made it easier to track cargo and drivers while improving efficiency and safety along the supply chain.\n\nConsidering all of the work that goes into Amazon’s e-commerce services, it may come as no surprise that the company relies heavily on the latest technology in order to accomplish its consumer delivery goals. Amazon has been using AI to power its product recommendations for years. The company has also adopted machine learning to build the handheld virtual assistant, Amazon Echo.\n\nWarehouse Automation in Logistics\n\nAmazon doesn’t solely use technology to maximize the customer experience. In fact, the company’s technological expertise extends to its packaging and delivery services. The e-commerce company made headlines in 2012 when it introduced automation into its supply chain upon acquiring Kiva Systems. Today, Amazon’s warehouses are filled with thousands of robots built to optimize the picking and packing process.\n\nAmazon isn’t the only logistics leader that has unlocked the potential of robotics. In fact, the warehouse automation space has grown tremendously over the past several years and is expected to become increasingly more valuable over time. The growth of this sector is attributed largely to the steady rise of e-commerce, which has ignited the need to send products out quickly while lowering operating costs. The popularity of online grocery shopping in particular has bolstered the growth of warehouse automation, as online grocery retailers have been forced to meet consumers’ ever-increasing demands while competing with brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles in Logistics\n\nAs warehouse automation continues to infiltrate the logistics industry, autonomous vehicles are becoming a supply chain essential. For companies like Amazon, self-driving vehicles are not only profitable within the warehouse, as they harbor the potential to make on-road delivery faster and more efficient. Companies like Starship Technologies are developing revolutionary new ways to autonomously transport goods, thus unleashing new possibilities within the logistics realm.\n\nDrones in Logistics\n\nAlongside the emergence of autonomous vehicles, the commercial use of drones has opened up new avenues for supply chain management. Within a warehouse setting, drones can be used for aerial inspection and can even carry out maintenance requests, all of which can save manufacturers vast amounts of time.\n\nGiven drones’ ability to quickly transport small items, many tech companies are trying their hand at developing aerial transportation modes. For instance, logistics startup Zipline has created unmanned drones designed to quickly deliver goods, reduce emissions and integrate with existing operations.\n\n3D Printing in Logistics\n\nWhile there are many options when it comes to packaging and delivering goods quickly, supply chain experts are still searching for ways to manufacture products at a speed that meet consumers’ growing expectations. For this reason, 3D printing has entered the logistics space as a possible solution. The process of gathering supplies and producing a product often requires the most time and effort within the supply chain setting.\n\nIf 3D printing were applied to the production process, consumers would have greater control over the supply chain. Potentially, a consumer could place an order for a product and then a local 3D printer shop would quickly create the product before sending it out for delivery. 3D printing could ultimately disrupt the logistics industry, as it offers manufacturers the opportunity to produce complex and customized goods faster than ever before.",

      "# [What Is Wearable Technology? Examples of Wearables](https://builtin.com/wearables)\nWhat Is Wearable Technology?\n\nIt seems like everything nowadays is a smart device. Smart toasters. Smart dog collars. Smart homes. In the age of smart, there is nothing more intelligent or more innovative than the devices being produced by the wearables industry.\n\nWearable devices help collect and analyze real-time personal data that informs us on everything from our health to our workouts. They’ve become extremely popular tools to help us stay informed and in touch with ourselves to the point that almost a quarter of people in the U.S. now sport a wearable device.\n\nWhat Are Wearables?\n\nWearables make up a broad category that includes any device worn or attached to a user’s body. Smart watches, VR headsets and wearable electrocardiograms are a few examples. These devices support purposes related to areas like health and fitness, entertainment and everyday use.\n\nWhat exactly is a wearable? Wearables are electronic devices that are worn on a person — usually close to the skin — in order to accurately relay important medical, biological and exercise data to a database.\n\nWearables have helped make the IoT industry the $594 billion dollar behemoth it is today (the wearables industry itself is expected to balloon to $111 billion by 2027). Apple Watches and Fitbits are classic examples of wearable technology, but those aren’t the only devices being developed today. In addition to smart watches, VR and AR technology, smart jackets and a wide variety of other gadgets are leading us towards a better-connected lifestyle. Each device’s main job is to collect millions of data points that range from how many steps you take to your heart rate.\n\nBenefits of Wearables\n\nThe advancement of wearables has been a welcomed tool for the insurance, healthcare and sports industries for a number of reasons. From encouraging healthier habits to optimizing physical performance, industries have reaped numerous rewards that come with wearable tech.\n\nWearables Improve Healthcare\n\nThe healthcare industry is probably seeing the biggest benefit from wearable technology. Patients who wear these smart devices can measure information ranging from body temperature to blood pressure, which is then relayed to their medical team in real-time. If something looks off, doctors have a quicker way to accurately diagnose and treat a patient. The entire treatment process is now quicker thanks to the data collected by a wearable device because doctors no longer have to run a gamut of tests to determine an illness or disease. They can reference the data collected by a wearable to quickly figure out the cause of the medical mishap.\n\nBest Wearables Companies Hiring NowView the Top Wearables Companies With Open Jobs\n\nWearables Provide More Insights Into Sports and Fitness Performance\n\nHaving all of this health data in real-time is, of course, helping the sports and fitness industries push the boundaries of training. Professional athletes from all over the world maximize their training regimes thanks to the biometric data captured through wearable technology. Elite athletes, from marathon runners to the Golden State Warriors and Liverpool FC, are using smart compression shirts to maximize every move an athlete makes. These smart shirts use a combination of GPS, accelerometers and biomedical sensors to constantly measure the performance of each athlete. Is Liverpool superstar Mo Salah taking the optimal route to a ball? Is NBA all-star Steph Curry maximizing his hydration levels to perform at his peak ability? How can MLB players, like Mike Trout or Kris Bryant, maximize their acceleration out of the batter’s box? Wearable technology is the key to answering these questions and unlocking the optimal potential of world-class athletes.\n\nWearables Increase the Productivity and Health of Workforces\n\nThe business world has benefited from the introduction of wearables to its workforce. Seventy-nine percent of employees who wear a smart device in the office report that the devices are instrumental to their work. Equipping a workforce with wearable devices makes sense for employers. These devices enhance communication, track employee activity, boost job site safety measures and can actually improve the health and quality of life for a workforce. A healthier, happier workforce will then lead to higher rates of employee retention, saving companies thousands, if not millions, of dollars annually.\n\nExamples of Wearable Technologies\n\nHealth and Fitness Wearables\n\nWearables are often associated with the health and wellness sectors. Smart watches, like a Fitbit or Apple Watch, have pioneered the way we track everything from heart rates to our daily steps. Constantly checking in with them has become part of a daily routine for many.\n\nThese watches inherently encourage healthier lifestyles because of the data they collect. Knowing how far you run encourages you to push yourself further to beat your old record. Seeing that you’re almost to your daily 10,000-step goal encourages you to go for a walk around the block. Even tracking your current sleep habits could lead to changes that help you sleep more soundly at night. In a sense, wearable tech is one of the best ways to gamify the health and wellness journey.\n\nLife Insurance Wearables\n\nIn order to promote healthier lifestyles, life insurance companies issue wearables to their customers, who then track their health data. Devices like smart watches and fitness trackers provide details on someone’s activity levels, heart rate and other important health data points. The data collected informs premium prices and can paint a more accurate picture about the overall health of life insurance customers. It’s a much more concrete method rather than relying on a vague metric, such as one’s age, when creating an individual policy.\n\nGaming Wearables\n\nGaming is one of the biggest frontiers for wearable technology. Virtual reality (VR) headsets are the most common form of wearable devices in the industry. VR headsets, like the Oculus Rift or the Playstation VR, instantly immerse gamers in other-worldly experiences from the second they strap in. Do you want to know how it would feel to fight with Lightsabers? Maybe you really want to live out your adrenaline junky dreams of racing in the Indianapolis 500? VR wearables are bringing awe-inspiring experiences like these to gamers all over the world.\n\nWearable technologies taking off in the gaming industry are haptic devices. These smart wearables provide tactile feedback to a gamer in real time. This means that a device takes advantage of a gamer’s sense of touch by providing force or vibrations to a user. To put it simply, haptic vests, gloves or suits make gaming more realistic — a gamer can now feel actual recoil after shooting their virtual weapon or can even experience real feedback of what it feels like to dribble a virtual basketball. Though still in its infancy, haptic technology is poised to make the future of gaming, and wearables, more entertaining and realistic.\n\nFashion Wearables\n\nIt only makes sense that wearable tech has started to permeate fashion culture. Athletes wear full-body suits, equipped with hundreds of little IoT sensors, to measure their every move. The data gathered will help them to better optimize their swing, shot or kick. The consumer wearable technology clothing industry is still relatively new, albeit already intriguing. Smart jackets are being made to automatically cool or warm the body based on body temperatures taken from sensors throughout the jacket. Smart rings are giving people a stylish way to track their steps or measure their sleep habits. Our pants might one day become smart enough to use the thermal energy our bodies naturally produce to charge our cell phones. Wearable devices in fashion demonstrate that tech can be smart and sophisticated all at once.\n\nTravel Wearables\n\nThe ability of smart wearables to immerse users in virtual environments has made them a vital tool for the travel industry. With VR technology, companies can provide in-depth virtual tours of hotel rooms, local landmarks and other potential destinations. People can then make more informed decisions about where they choose to stay and visit, resulting in a higher-quality travel experience for customers.\n\nMany airlines also cater to wearable devices, allowing customers to store tickets and boarding passes in a digital wallet like Apple Wallet. If someone is wearing a smart watch, they can pull up any necessary passes for a faster entry and boarding process.\n\nEducation Wearables\n\nEducation has had to adapt to the digital age, and wearable tech has helped the industry catch up with the latest developments. Smart glasses and VR headsets enable organizations to train students and employees through simulations and virtual environments. Users are immersed in a real-life scenario, allowing them to spend more time learning by doing rather than listening to a lecture or presentation.\n\nIn addition, brain sensor headbands track when someone’s mind is stressed and relaxed. Educators can leverage this device to learn when students are pushing their minds too much and teach them how to remain calm while taking in new experiences and knowledge.\n\nLogistics Wearables\n\nAnother beneficiary of wearables is the logistics industry, which relies on wearable tech to develop more efficient operations. Smart glasses like Google Glass enable warehouse workers to quickly scan barcodes, pull up information from a database and make updates along the way. This process eliminates the need for workers to keep going back to a physical computer, saving them time as they organize packages and items.\n\nSome VR glasses go as far as to help workers determine their location in a large warehouse, mapping out the optimal route to travel between two points. These glasses can also reveal the best ways to organize packages for maximized storage without crushing lighter items. All these abilities make wearable devices a must-have for logistics companies.",
      "# [A Look Into the Gaming Industry: Types of Video Games and Gaming Jobs](https://builtin.com/gaming)\nGaming Industry Overview\n\nThe gaming industry, a current $200 billion behemoth, is arguably one of the most important and innovative sectors in tech today. Its importance to culture, social networking and entertainment cannot be understated. The term “entertainment industry” is no longer reserved for Hollywood and the movie industry because gaming is now providing one of the most immersive and awe-inspiring forms of entertainment to more than three billion people around the globe.\n\nNobody could imagine what the gaming industry would blossom into when they were messing around with Pong joysticks in their basements and competing against their friends for the highest Pac-Man scores in the 1970s and ‘80s. These simple games would turn out to be the bedrock of today’s gaming industry and instant cultural phenomena.\n\nPioneered by evergrowing gaming companies, the current gaming industry is pushing the boundaries of technology to create cutting-edge and highly immersive entertainment experiences. Not only do we have the continuous advent of new consoles, PCs and devices that are putting us right into the game, but we also have the opportunity to watch some of the best gamers in the world compete in the esports arena and online through streaming platforms like Twitch and Mixer.\n\nGaming Platforms\n\nThe gaming wars of today are just heating up. The battle over console gaming is being waged by Microsoft (Xbox), Sony (Playstation) and Nintendo (Switch). These platforms are pushing the absolute boundaries of technology by offering gamers state-of-the-art graphics, speeds and processing powers.\n\nTraditional console makers, like Microsoft, will likely have to compete with cloud gaming platforms whose games available to those anywhere with any decent internet connection. Even Netflix is getting in on the gaming action. Additionally, PC gaming has opened up a world of opportunities for gamers who are looking for extra ease-of-use and dexterity when casually playing (or competing in) their favorite games.\n\nBest Gaming Companies With Open JobsView Top Gaming Companies Hiring Now\n\nEsports\n\nPicture your favorite sport. All sports, whether it’s soccer, basketball or baseball, have many things in common: passionate fans, sold-out stadiums, engaging commentators and world-class athletes. The same thing is true in the world of esports. esports athletes are essentially the Michael Jordans of their profession, but instead of dunking on opponents on a court, they’re outwitting, outmaneuvering and outplaying their opponents in virtual worlds. Thousands of screaming fans pack the arena to root on their teams who are sitting on stage clicking away for a chance at a title, while millions more watch online around the world.\n\nBy 2025, esports is projected to garner more than 640 million viewers worldwide, with about 318 million of those viewers specifically falling into the category of esports enthusiasts. With a growing fanbase that may rival any professional sport on earth, it’s no wonder that cultural icons and savvy investors, like basketball legend Michael Jordan, rapper Drake and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, all own at least partial stakes in esports teams.\n\nVideo Game Streaming\n\nStreaming has also been a massive success for the gaming industry and gamers alike. Platforms that support streaming like Twitch and Youtube Gaming give individual gamers the opportunity to livestream their in-game play to subscribers all over the world.\n\nThis innovation has allowed millions of streamers to gain a fanbase, interact with one another and monetize their gaming skills. Streaming has become uber-popular to the point where Twitch alone, the most-watched game streaming platform, garnered almost 1.5 billion minutes of watchtime in 2021. Breakout successes in the streaming industry, like Tyler “Ninja” Blevins, have been able to make upwards of $10 million a year just through the fans and endorsement deals that come with running a popular streaming profile.\n\nThe meteoric rise of the gaming industry is just getting started. Born from humble beginnings, today’s gaming sector is ready to take on any other in tech for the title of the most innovative industry. What makes gaming so special is that it’s not only immersive and entertaining, but it’s inclusive and expansive as well. There is a game and a way to play for almost every human, which makes gaming one of the most beloved industries in the world.\n\nGaming Equipment and Technology\n\nConsole Gaming\n\nConsole gaming is the original (and probably most well-known) form of digital gaming. In the early days, Nintendo and Sega dominated the market for consoles. Today, Xbox and Playstation have become the two most popular consoles, offering millions of players the ability to experience the latest in gaming technology.\n\nConsoles have been a good indicator of the tech market as a whole. In the beginning, consoles were simple joysticks just technologically-ept enough to run simple games like Pong. Now, consoles, like the new Xbox Series X, have specially designed microchips that process images and power as efficiently as possible, all the while, being designed for 8K television screens. Gaming consoles are truly pushing the limits of consumer entertainment technology.\n\nPC Gaming\n\nPCs have had a meteoric rise in gameplay with almost 1.8 billion people using computers as their gaming tool of choice by the end of 2022. Gaming computers are all about efficiency. Gaming PCs have their own dedicated RAM space, GPUs and cooling systems that help to efficiently run games in real-time. These bulked-up computers can handle graphically demanding games and can even make it easier for streamers who need a reliable system to manage gaming at a high level and livestreaming their gameplay at the same time. Games like Fortnite, League of Legends and Minecraft have made gaming one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world today.\n\nQuantum computing is a sector to look out for when it comes to gaming. Still in its infancy, quantum computing has the ability to completely upend the gaming industry (and world) as we know it. These computers dwarf anything that computers can do now, and this technology is primed to make an impact in the gaming industry. Because quantum computers have unfathomable amounts of power and information storage, they’re able to render the best graphics imaginable in real time. These computers also fix a huge problem currently plaguing the gaming industry; predictability. Who wants to play a game where they know exactly what happens? A quantum computer’s massive storage of algorithms could actually make gaming unpredictable and unique for each gamer.\n\nBest E-Sports Companies With Open RolesView Top E-Sports Companies Hiring Now\n\nCloud Gaming\n\nCloud gaming is the newest type of video game technology making headlines. Imagine Netflix, but for gaming. You scroll through a library of games, choose which game you want and automatically start playing the game. No discs and no load times. Play on your phone, iPad or console. Cloud-based gaming platforms aim to make the whole gaming experience seamless and easy to play from anywhere at any time.\n\nCloud gaming is such a threat to traditional console gaming that Microsoft’s head of gaming, Phil Spencer, stated that Xbox is no longer concerned about competition from Nintendo or Playstation in 2020. Rather, they’re more focused on competing with the ultra-fast cloud platforms being hosted by companies like Amazon and Google. It is worth noting, however, that Google’s cloud-based gaming platform, Stadia, is shutting down in 2023.\n\nVR/AR Gaming\n\nVirtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are meant to put you right in the middle of the action. Instead of playing from a third person point-of-view, VR drops people into computer-generated environments to make them feel like they’re actually part of the game. VR offers gamers the ability to step into magical worlds and do everything from kick around a soccer ball to fight off hordes of monsters (like in the video above). Additionally, being directly a part of these kinds of digital worlds has made the draw to the metaverse that more appealing.\n\nAugmented reality, on-the-other-hand, adds digital influences to real life. A popular example of AR in gaming is the mobile game Pokémon Go, in which smartphone cameras are used to find and capture virtual creatures in the real world. Gamers might come across a Pikachu in the park or even find a Wartortle on their walk to work.\n\nWhether our reality is augmented or virtual, it’s clear to see that technology is ushering in a completely new way to participate in, and enjoy, video games.\n\nMobile Gaming\n\nMobile gaming makes up about 45 percent of the total market share of the gaming industry with over half of the worldwide population projected to play a mobile game by 2027.\n\nWhy is mobile gaming so popular? It’s easily accessible and has games for every type of gamer. Instead of having to strap on a headset or pop a disc into a console, mobile gaming allows us to play wherever we go and whenever we want. In 2020, it took over television as the preferred choice of leisure activity with people spending more than 6.5 hours per week on mobile games.\n\nThe mobile gaming industry is poised for continual growth as investments in mobile gaming startups have skyrocketed, and creativity opens up avenues for more gamers to enjoy different types of exciting games.\n\nMore On GamingWhat Does the Future of Gaming Look Like?\n\nPopular Gaming Jobs\n\nTypes of Gaming Jobs\n\nVideo game designer\n\nVideo game programmer\n\nVideo game animator\n\nVideo game quality assurance (QA) tester\n\nVideo Game Designer\n\nThat incredibly intricate, expansive and beautifully designed game you’re playing didn’t just appear out of thin air. It took a team of extraordinarily talented video game designers months, even years, to create all the dimensions that a user encounters when playing a game. These designers go through several prototypes of the game before rendering the final, customer-facing version. This requires an ability to be focused and resilient, as well as, an extensive background knowledge of game design techniques, tools and skills.\n\nGame design, especially at the highest level, usually requires a bachelor’s or master’s degree with a vast knowledge in everything from 3D animation to graphic design and even physics. The job outlook for game design looks really steady because of the enormous rise in console, PC and mobile gaming. Cities like Los angeles, New York and Chicago employ the most designers, and a video game designer can make an average of $42,900 a year.\n\nMore On Game Design18 Video Game Design Courses to Know\n\nVideo Game Programmer\n\nVideo game programmers are some of the most sought-after individuals in the gaming industry. They’re the people who bring a designer’s work to life through code. A good video game would be nothing without the hard work of a programmer, who ensures that characters, missions and environments are supposed to interact the way they were intended. Most game programmers usually have at least a bachelor’s degree, but all need a vast competence of C++ (and other languages) in order to thrive.\n\nGaming’s popularity has caused a boom in industry hiring for programmers and it’s not projected to slow down. Job growth isn’t the only positive aspect about being a game programmer. The salary is too.\n\nThe median salary for software developers, which can encompass computer programming and digital design, is more than $109,000 annually. This puts programmers up there with some of the most well-paid positions in the U.S.\n\nVideo Game Animator\n\nYou can’t have a high quality game without video game animators. Game animators combine technology and art to create the interactive images and sequences that help tell the story of the game. Animators work closely with designers and programmers to make sure that a game’s environment interacts in a way that is natural, fun and helps to progress the game. Animators start every project with a basic storyboard, then help bring that story to life through a series of intricate animations. Animators usually have an extensive background in multimedia knowledge, as well as a degree in a field like computer graphics or animation.\n\nThe video game animation field is projected to grow by about 16 percent until 2030, meaning animators can expect to see a healthy salary. On a median salary, animators can expect a value of around $79,000.\n\nVideo Game Testing and Quality Assurance (QA)\n\nGetting paid to play video games might be the ultimate dream job. Luckily, video game testers (better known as video game quality assurance testers) get paid to play, but more importantly, break, video games. Game QA testers push the work of designers, programmers and animators to the limits to ensure that games are free of bugs and allow for gamers to have the freedom to explore in these virtual environments. Testers usually run through what is called matrix testing, where they have to test every permutation and combination of events that could possibly happen in a game to ensure that nothing can break it.\n\nThere are really no essential educational credentials to have when it comes to QA testing video games. However, these testers need to have an eye for details, a tolerance for repetition and an intense passion for the gaming industry. Video game testers are in demand right now (especially in mobile gaming) due to the rapid increase of games being produced. Game and QA testers on average make around $55,000 annually.",
      "# [What Is Marketing? Basics of Marketing & Types](https://builtin.com/marketing)\nWhat Is Marketing?\n\nMarketing is one of, if not the, most important aspects of a business. What good is selling a life-changing product if customers have never heard of it and don’t know anything about it? That’s where capable marketers come in handy. Marketers help companies identify consumer and industry trends, formulate campaigns and captivate audiences by showing how their products shine over others.\n\nWhat, exactly, is marketing? Simply put, marketing is the activity of getting people aware of and interested in a brand and its products, often by promoting its offerings so that customers perceive them as valuable or desirable.\n\nWhat Do Marketers Do?\n\nMarketing is the process of designing, positioning, promoting and distributing a product or service in such a way that consumers see value in it. The role of marketers is often to increase brand awareness and loyalty, attract new customers and retain existing ones, ultimately driving more sales revenue for their company.\n\nWhether we’re conscious of it or not, marketing is all around us. Billboards along a highway, commercials on TV, advertisements in magazines, brand posts on social media and optimized content on a website are all everyday examples of marketing.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of marketing is Nike’s slogan “Just Do It.” Pairing “Just Do It” with world-class athlete spokespeople has proven to be one of the most effective marketing campaigns of the last 30 years. The phrase resonates with competitive athletes and fosters a sense of pushing yourself to be a better athlete (in your Nike gear, of course).\n\nOne of the reasons why marketing is so heavily emphasized is that it often helps inform other aspects of the business. Product, sales and advertising teams are all affected by the efforts of a marketing team. Marketers are responsible for guiding the decisions of these teams with valuable insights, so they compile data in the form of market research.\n\nMarket research entails gathering information about a business’ key demographics, their affinity toward a company’s current products and what other competitors are doing. A marketing team’s in-depth market research informs product and engineering teams on what to create, sales teams on what to sell and advertising teams on what to communicate.\n\nWhy Is Marketing Important?\n\nMarketing is a core component of business success because it impacts a company’s ability to reach customers, develop a brand and generate revenue.\n\nBenefits of Marketing\n\nEstablish a customer base\n\nDevelop a trustworthy brand\n\nAdd value to company products\n\nGenerate higher sales profits\n\nMarketing serves as a lifeline that connects brands to potential customers. Market research enables teams to determine who their target audience is and tailor their messaging and communications accordingly. Businesses can then generate positive perception within consumers who are most likely to find value in and buy their products.\n\nOver time, a well-planned marketing strategy solidifies a company’s brand and messaging. This is crucial because consistent branding tells consumers what to expect from a company and leads to a reputation. If a business can continue to meet these expectations and live up to its reputation, it can create trust among loyal customers and add value to its brand in the eyes of consumers.\n\nThe ultimate reward for these efforts is higher sales, and some of the most effective brands have become synonymous with winning and success. For example, many customers will pay more for a Nike shoe than an anonymous brand’s shoe based on the reputation of the Nike brand alone. An ideal brand highlights what makes a company unique, setting it apart from competitors and transforming its products into coveted items among consumers.\n\nThe 4 Ps of Marketing\n\nThe 4 Ps of marketing is a popular framework for understanding the areas involved in marketing strategy. Sometimes known as the marketing mix, the four Ps of marketing — product, price, place and promotion — are vital to every good marketing campaign.\n\n1. Product\n\nProduct is the good or service that the company is offering. Quality products should be able to satisfy customer needs, while also being able to satisfy customer demand. To effectively market a product, marketers need to pinpoint the value it brings to the customer and why customers would want it. The marketing team can start working on campaigns once these, and many other, questions are answered.\n\n2. Price\n\nPrice is obviously a large factor into whether a consumer buys your product or goes to a competitor. Good marketing teams rely on industry research to appropriately price their products so they boost their market share and reach more happy customers.\n\n3. Place\n\nIt’s critical that marketing professionals take place — both digital and physical — into account when marketing a product. Is a certain product more marketable in-store or online? Should you sell a certain product internationally? How do you market to certain geographical locations? How much does a location’s culture affect your marketing abilities? Marketing teams need to be hyper-aware of where they’re marketing to truly optimize their efforts.\n\n4. Promotion\n\nWhat good is a marketing effort if there isn’t some excitement and build-up around a product? Promotion includes the advertising, promotional strategy and public relations surrounding a product. “Should we create a commercial?” “Should we sponsor a podcast?” “Should we just run a Google Adwords campaign?” With some help from market research, marketing executives should be able to know when to target their audience and through which medium. Executing the promotion step of the marketing mix is vital because it helps to build fervor for a product and brand awareness.\n\nTypes of Marketing\n\nMarketing isn’t just a one-size-fits-all effort. There are different types of marketing campaigns depending on where an organization’s customers spend their time and how they prefer to be reached. Below are eight popular types of marketing:\n\nTypes of Digital Marketing\n\nSocial Media Marketing\n\nSocial media marketing involves the use of social media channels (like Instagram, Twitter and YouTube) to build a brand, connect with customers, drive website traffic and increase sales. These platforms have proven to be excellent marketing tools because they have the ability to educate customers on products, individualize consumer social media experiences and engage with an audience in a way that wasn’t possible before. Marketers rely on data analytics tools to develop targeted ads and timely posts that increase social media engagement with brands and boost revenue.\n\nContent Marketing\n\nContent marketing focuses on creating relevant, interesting and valuable content that attracts an audience and converts them into customers. Marketers are turning to this form of content because it boosts SEO traffic and increases both the quantity and quality of customers. A clever content marketing example is Coca Cola’s “Share a Coke” campaign. The company labeled its iconic bottles and cans with popular names to build stronger bonds with customers. The experiment was such a resounding success in Australia that it ended up being implemented in 80 countries worldwide.\n\nInfluencer Marketing\n\nInfluencer marketing is a type of social media marketing that relies on the virality and popularity of social media influencers, who are paid to promote and endorse products. Essentially, companies pay social media accounts with a large following to include their product in an Instagram, Snapchat or even Facebook post. Influencer marketing has proven profitable for both the company and the influencer. The company potentially gets millions of views of their product and the influencer gets paid. For example, to reach Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s 340 million Instagram followers, companies need to pay about $1 million per post.\n\nSEO Marketing\n\nHave you ever wondered how a search engine picks its search results for your specific query? How does it know what to choose at the top option? Much of that has to do with search engine optimization (SEO). SEO is the practice of increasing unpaid (known as organic) traffic through a variety of technical and content-related practices that make it easier for a search engine to read, understand and rank a site. Optimizing a site’s content, photos or backend procedures provides an uncluttered and efficient experience for both a user and a search engine, resulting in higher rankings. The higher rankings provided by this free method of marketing boosts traffic and converts a casual audience into loyal customers.\n\nTypes of Traditional Marketing\n\nPrint Marketing\n\nPrint marketing involves marketers reaching out to target audiences through offline formats. Brochures, informative flyers and mail advertisements are a few examples of print marketing that marketers hand out or deliver to the homes of consumers. Businesses may also try to reach wider audiences by placing ads in magazines, newspapers and other publications. While marketing teams focus on producing concise written content, they must also determine how to pair text with visuals. The most effective print marketing materials complement engaging writing with relevant images, branded color schemes and other eye-catching elements.\n\nBillboard Marketing\n\nBillboard marketing is another way to expose more consumers to a brand and features content on larger physical surfaces. Consumers can find these kinds of advertisements in crowded areas like Times Square, along popular highways or on the walls of buildings. Some companies may pay for mobile billboards, placing ads on the sides of trucks or public transportation vehicles. All billboards follow the same principles of print marketing, combining written content with coordinated color schemes, images and other visuals. Marketing teams need to get creative with billboards, such as applying bold colors or humorous content, since drivers and passersby may only have a few moments to take in a message.\n\nEvent Marketing\n\nEvent marketing relies on both company-sponsored and public events where a business can have conversations with customers and spread its brand through physical materials. Examples of company-sponsored events include hosting a conference or learning convention. Organizations may also join public events, such as setting up a booth at a local community arts fest. Companies should supply marketing teams with materials like tents, banners and flyers for interested individuals. If possible, it’s also helpful to have a sample of a product for consumers to view. Each event provides an opportunity for marketers to share information with consumers and answer any questions, spreading their company’s brand and earning new customers.\n\nProduct Marketing\n\nProduct marketing is vital to the success of a new product launch and is applicable across many industries. Even before the product is built, these marketers are doing intense market research to ensure that the product is the right fit for a company’s customers and that it serves a useful purpose. Then, the product team will use the product marketer’s insights as a guide on what to include in the new product. As the product is being built, the marketer will arm the sales team with the necessary knowledge and materials that will help them sell the product to current customers and reach out to new audiences. After a launch, the product marketer will ensure that customers aren’t having adoption issues and will craft marketing materials to make sure that the product stays relevant as time goes on.\n\nHow to Get Into Marketing\n\nMarketing is a unique field, filled with people who are analytical, yet have an in-depth understanding of human psychology and storytelling. Companies all over the world need competent marketers as more and more products are developed. Who best to evangelize a product other than the people who have the most knowledge about the industry? If you think that mixing analytics with storytelling sounds intriguing, then a career path in marketing might be for you.\n\nThis is the perfect time to get into a marketing role. It’s expected that the advertising and marketing industry will eclipse $786 billion by 2026. Digital marketing has taken on a larger role, with click-and-display ads becoming popular tools for marketers.\n\nMarketing Education Requirements\n\nMost marketing jobs require at least a bachelor’s degree in marketing, journalism, graphic design or a similar major. This shows hiring managers that you have a firm marketing background right away. Of course, having a degree isn’t the only way to break into the industry. There are plenty of reputable courses and bootcamps that can help you become a quality job candidate (or to learn more if you’re already in the industry).\n\nMarketing Career Path\n\nThere are a few career paths that can be taken. In a more traditional marketing sense, newcomers normally start out as marketing coordinators and then work their way up to marketing manager, marketing director and then CMO.\n\nDigital marketers have more options when it comes to roles and paths to take. These marketers usually start out as coordinators and can then experience roles like marketing specialist, search engine marketing manager, social media manager, or marketing director on their way to a CMO or VP of Marketing role. New job titles and responsibilities have been constantly popping up over the last few years due to the advent of new, groundbreaking technologies in the marketing field.\n\nMarketing Career Paths\n\nThere are many important roles that make up a marketing team because of the sector’s importance to the overall goals of a company.

      "# [What Is Consumer Technology? A Guide](https://builtin.com/consumer-tech)\nA Brief History of Consumer Tech\n\nConsumer technology is the umbrella term for any type of technology created with the general public’s use in mind. Think TVs, toaster ovens, smartphones and fitness apps.\n\nConsumer tech can be traced back to the 19th century, when early tech pioneers like David Edward Hughes, Heinrich Rudolph Hertz, Nikola Tesla and Jagadish Edward Bose manipulated electricity for widespread use throughout the world. Indeed, much of the consumer tech we still interact with daily was invented during this period of innovation set between the end of the 19th century and the mid-20th century, including computers (first developed between 1940-45), transistor radios (introduced in 1954) and the microwave oven (1946).\n\nTechnology has continued to develop over time, improving and creating products that are thousands of times more capable than predecessors while enabling form factors to shrink and prices to decrease — creating a technological revolution with the power to reshape our world. Computers, for instance, were once an exclusive product and would require an entire room to store just a few megabytes. Today, powerful computers exist in the pockets of 85 percent of Americans in the form of smartphones, capable of housing hundreds of gigabytes of data with unlimited amounts of cloud space available at all times.\n\nIn another few decades, the advances in consumer tech might be unfathomable to us today.\n\nConsumer Tech Companies\n\nAlphabet (Google)\n\nApple\n\nIntel\n\nSamsung\n\nSony\n\nTesla\n\nWhirlpool\n\nYamaha\n\nConsumer Tech Vs. High Tech\n\nWhile consumer tech typically refers to general-audience-oriented technology like lightbulbs, calculators, cell phones or televisions, high-tech products are slightly different. High tech, or advanced technology, can be thought of as the most cutting-edge forms of technology available, and sometimes refers to the newest type of technology on the market.\n\nOne example of high technology is autonomous mobile robotsthat help package goods. High-tech products such as autonomous vehicles can be used by the general public but are less common than consumer technology products like a microwave or bluetooth sound system.\n\nRead NextBye, Middleman: These Are the Trends Shaping E-Commerce Right Now\n\nTechnology has evolved to better meet and fulfill the needs of people, and as a result, people are now constantly interacting with consumer technology products. Several categories and subcategories of customer technology exist, with plenty of overlap.\n\nTypes of Consumer Technology\n\nAppliances\n\nSmart devices\n\nFitness wearables\n\nSelf-driving cars\n\nVideo game consoles and devices\n\nDrones\n\nComputer software\n\nAs more products are introduced at conferences like the Consumer Electronics Show, these categories will inevitably expand. There are hundreds of categories that could be listed here and products will continue to hit the market as technology evolves. Some of today’s most notable consumer tech categories include:\n\n5G Devices\n\nDevices connected to 5G networks — or 4G, LTE or any other form of cellular network — are able to receive network signals from cellular towers and provide users with online connectivity. Many of the most common forms of consumer electronics fall into this category, including smartphones, tablets and portable hotspots.\n\nIoT Devices\n\nInternet of Things, or IoT, devices connect to specific applications via the internet or other forms of wireless networks for unparalleled user visibility and control. Some common consumer tech products in the IoT devices category included smart home appliances, such as app-controlled thermostats, locks and lights, sensor-based products like doorbells with cameras set to alert users to movement, and various Bluetooth devices.\n\nComputers\n\nIn recent years, computers’ capabilities have increased while their costs have decreased. And everyday people use them for all sorts of reasons — work, gaming, video streaming, internet browsing and more. Laptops, desktops, tablets, gaming computers, video game consoles, smartphones, hard drives and several other types of devices fall into this consumer tech category.\n\nSelf-Driving and Electric Vehicle Consumer Tech\n\nSince their emergence in the early 20th century, cars and motor vehicles of all kinds have grown to become one of the most critical forms of consumer tech to most societies around the world. As technology has improved, so have cars, with vehicles now commonly possessing high-tech features such as built-in GPS, self-driving capabilities, automatic braking, lane sensors, rearview cameras, power steering, and a bevy of additional online and offline capabilities that enhance both safety and comfort. Electric vehicles have eliminated the need for wasteful natural gas resources and self-driving cars are on the rise.\n\nTelevisions and Smart Screens\n\nTelevision became a cultural phenomenon in the mid-20th century and its status has since become cemented as a focal point of modern society. The average American adult watches three hours of television per day, as of 2022. TV and smart screens have been bolstered by the many advancements that the near-century old medium has undergone. Today’s top-end “smart TVs” come loaded with WiFi/5G capabilities, built-in applications, internet search capabilities, built-in gaming features, computer monitoring and more.\n\nSmart Speakers\n\nLeading consumer tech companies like Amazon and Google have introduced a variety of home speakers with built-in virtual assistant technology. These speakers possess internet connectivity and can play music, look up information, place orders and complete a variety of additional tasks by linking to existing accounts. Three of the most popular smart speakers are the Amazon Echo, Apple HomePod and Google Home.\n\nAppliances\n\nHome appliances are a form of consumer tech products that allow people to live easier, more fulfilling lives. From microwave ovens and various kitchen appliances to laundry machines, space heaters and more, appliances of some kind can be found in a majority of homes worldwide.\n\nFitness and Wearables\n\nFitness and consumer tech have merged in seamless fashion, with people embracing devices that track their daily fitness goals and keep them engaged in their activities and workouts. Wearables expand beyond fitness, however, with devices and technology hitting the market that filter air, keep users temperate, alert the proper parties when in danger or in need of help, and much more. Wearable consumer tech includes smartwatches, fitness trackers, heart rate monitors, 911-alerting devices and tech-enabled clothing.\n\nGaming\n\nThe video gaming industry has exploded since its rise through the late 1970s and the 1980s. Today’s systems possess the processing capabilities that would have been unfathomable to game designers back in those days, such as 5K graphics, online gameplay and lightning-fast processor speeds. Video gaming consoles, games, software, VR devices, gaming computers, handheld consoles, add-ons, and accessories are all included in this category.\n\nDrones and Robotics\n\nDrones have been in military use since the 20th century, with commercial and consumer drones hitting the market in the early 21st century. Consumer drones have the ability to take photos, record videos and deliver packages at previously unreachable heights and distances, produced in a variety of form factors and with many accessories for customizing personal drone experiences.\n\nAudio and Music Consumer Tech\n\nSome consumers, whether audiophiles or musicians, take sound very seriously. This category is meant to address that, creating technologically advanced solutions that help them dial in the perfect sound response to their ears, in real time. Multi-room sound systems, Bluetooth speakers, amplifiers, interfaces, microphones, instruments and software all fall into this category of consumer tech.\n\nPhotography\n\nThe first cameras emerged in the late 19th century, since then, photography equipment has embraced digital and technological advancements to unlock capabilities like faster shutter speeds, faster lens speeds, 5K video capturing, low-light shooting and much more. Photography consumer tech includes camera bodies, lenses, sensors, hard drives, memory cards, flash units and additional accessories.\n\nDelivery Consumer Tech\n\nDelivery apps and food delivery platforms have become an integral part of people’s lives. Delivery services use several facets of technology to bring products right to our doors. This industry could not exist without the right software, mobile technology and vehicles.\n\nSoftware\n\nMuch of the consumer tech that people interact with is not a physical product but software that writes the rules to allow hardware to function. Software is responsible for enabling nearly all forms of consumer tech products to work and interact, from menu screens to full-on computer programs.\n\nRelated ReadingProptech: Everything You Need to Know (With 25 Examples)",
      "# [What Is Cryptanalysis? (Definition, Types, Goals) by Anthony Corbo on 2023-01-03](https://builtin.com/articles/cryptanalysis)\nCryptanalysis is the study and discovery of vulnerabilities within cryptographic algorithms that can be used to decrypt ciphertext without knowledge of the secret key. Several forms of cryptanalysis can be used to attack cryptographic messages, ranging from the interception of messages within unsecured communication channels to the matching of plaintext based on the same algorithm techniques. Cryptanalysis also includes measures taken to stop attackers from decoding cryptographic algorithms.\n\nMore From Built In ExpertsHow to Break Into Cybersecurity\n\nTypes of Cryptanalysis\n\nThere are three generic forms of cryptanalysis: ciphertext-only, known ciphertext/plaintext pairs and chosen plaintext or chosen ciphertext.\n\nIn ciphertext-only cryptanalysis, the attacker has the ciphertext available to them for decoding. In known ciphertext/plaintext pair cryptanalysis, attackers will know some element of the plaintext and will be able to match likely elements of the ciphertext to the known plaintext. For example, a computer session may begin with “LOG IN.”\n\nDeciphering this string of text will also allow the attacker to decrypt plaintext that matches the deciphered ciphertext throughout the message. Chosen plaintext or chosen ciphertext cryptanalysis occurs when the attacker unwittingly causes either the transmitter to encrypt plaintext or the receiver to decrypt ciphertext. This provides the attacker with an abundance of knowledge, possibly even knowledge of the entire message’s contents.\n\nWhat Is the Primary Goal of Cryptanalysis?\n\nCryptanalysis is used to understand the contents of protected or encrypted messages and data in order to gain access to either in-transit or at-rest data. Attackers using cryptanalysis may have several goals for doing so, but the ultimate goal is always some degree of cryptographic decryption through either the ciphertext or plain text.\n\nSome specific goals associated with cryptanalysis include a total break (the locating of the secret key), global deduction (the locating of a functionally equivalent algorithm for encryption and decryption without knowledge of the secret key), information deduction (the acquiring of a portion of information about the plaintext or ciphertext that was not previously known), and the distinguishing of the algorithm (giving the attacker the ability to determine the encryption’s output from a random selection of plaintext).\n\nMore From the Built In Tech DictionaryWhat Is a DDoS Attack?\n\nWhat Does a Cryptanalyst Do?\n\nCryptanalysts can be hired to find security weaknesses, potential data leak causes, discover evidence from encrypted messages and more.\n\nCryptanalysts are often associated with government agencies or law enforcement, hired to ensure agency encryption methods are up to par with the current standards in cybersecurity and engage in the deciphering of encrypted messages. Cryptanalysts do this by purposefully exploiting weaknesses so fixes can be applied. As mentioned, government organizations often employ cryptanalysts to decipher encrypted communications and law enforcement agencies will hire cryptanalysts to decode encrypted messages within evidence or testify as experts on a case.\n\nRegardless of their industry or ethics, cryptanalysts must have a strong understanding of mathematics, ciphers, codes, and encryption systems, with daily responsibilities including analyzing intelligence information, diagnosing weaknesses within cryptographic algorithms, developing new cryptanalysis tools and more.",
      "# [Cyberloafing: What Is It and How To Prevent It by Dawn Kawamoto on 2022-11-28](https://builtin.com/articles/cyberloafing)\nCyberloafing in the workplace is a bad thing, right?\n\nAfter all, this habit of employees engaging in non-work-related internet surfing costs U.S. employers a whopping $85 billion a year, according to a University of Nevada report cited by the BBC.\n\nAnd 36 percent of millennials and Gen Z said they spend two or more hours per workday looking at their phones for personal activities, according to over 1,000 full-time U.S. workers surveyed in the 2018 Workplace Distraction Report by online learning company Udemy.\n\nWhat Is Cyberloafing?\n\nCyberloafing is when employees use their work time to engage in non-work-related internet activities from checking social media and personal email to web browsing and more.\n\nAnd with more people working from home following the pandemic, cyberloafing is only increasing.\n\nThe initial reaction often is to stomp out cyberloafing because of its adverse impact on productivity, but research is emerging that raises questions about its potential benefits (like addressing burnout), too.\n\nMore on Work CultureWhat Does Hybrid Work Culture Look Like?\n\nFree Guide: What Does it Take to Retain a Remote Workforce?\n\nHow to reduce turnover while increasing engagement and inclusion for remote employees.\n\nWhat Is Cyberloafing?\n\nCyberloafing is a term to describe employees who use work time to engage in non-work-related activities on the internet, such as web browsing, using social media, or checking and responding to personal email.\n\nAnd while its definition is relatively simple to describe, the way it can manifest makes it a complex matter. Some workers may turn to cyberloafing to relieve stress on the job and browse the internet as a coping mechanism, according to a study titled “Unraveling Cyberloafing Paradox: Towards a Targeted Approach for Managing Cyberloafing.”\n\nEmployees spending time browsing the internet on their phone, or emailing friends and looking at social media when they are supposed to be working on a report is a blatant example of cyberloafing, Bright Frimpong, a research assistant at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley and co-author of the “Unraveling Cyberloafing Paradox” study, told Built In.\n\nBut there are also a lot of gray areas when it comes to cyberloafing, Frimpong added. For example, he said, if there is a lull in your work while you wait for another team to finish a project to hand over to you, are you really cyberloafing if you use the time to check your personal email, look up sports scores or watch a YouTube video?\n\n“It’s very difficult to pinpoint these as cyberloafing behaviors because even though they are not productive, the employee has really nothing to do at that time,” Frimpong added. “I think it’s just a matter of being productive at the right time.”\n\nThe term was coined in 1995 but grew in popularity in 2002 after a research paper was published in the Organizational Behavior Journal on the topic. Initially, early research focused on the unproductive and harmful effects a company faced when its employees engaged in cyberloafing. But as study into this area matured, researchers began exploring other fringe areas of cyberloafing and the discovery of potential benefits began to emerge, Frimpong said.\n\nFind out who's hiring.\n\nSee all HR jobs at top tech companies & startups\n\nView Jobs\n\nWhat Causes Cyberloafing?\n\nTo understand the causes of cyberloafing, you need to understand what employees are trying to achieve by it. In some instances, there are tangible benefits like learning new skills. In others, the employee might use it for a much-needed break for their mental health or well-being.\n\nFor example, loneliness and workplace ostracism can prompt some employees to turn to social media to offset the lack of interaction with co-workers and others, said Natalie Mason, a PhD candidate at Aston University who is researching the use of cyberloafing as a coping mechanism and authored a report on the topic published in Nature Reviews Psychology.\n\nThese employees may find the emotional support they need to power through the rest of the day via social media, Mason said.\n\nWhat Causes Cyberloafing?\n\nLoneliness and workplace ostracism\n\nStress\n\nBurnout\n\nWorkplace aggression\n\nEmotional or physical pain\n\nBoredom\n\nDesire to find resources that make work and life better\n\nIn other cases, employees are using cyberloafing as a release valve for their stress, whether it’s from feeling burned out or because of workplace aggression from others, Mason said. It can provide a mental distraction that can help employees jump back into work once their cyberloafing break is over.\n\nCyberloafing can also help momentarily offset workplace boredom, allowing employees to take a mental break from their tasks and return refreshed.\n\nEmployees who lack adequate resources at work, such as an ergonomic office chair, may jump on the internet to learn of alternative resources they could use, like browsing for one. That internet activity, however, is considered a form of cyberloafing since it is not directly involved with the task at hand and is considered developing new non-work-related skills or abilities while on the job, Frimpong said.\n\nEmployer policies around allowing workers to bring their own electronic devices, such as smartphones, tablets or even laptops, into the workplace can also contribute to cyberloafing, since employees may feel it’s perfectly fine to use them anytime, despite being on the clock.\n\nMore on Mental HealthHow to Avoid Employee Burnout\n\nHow to Prevent Cyberloafing\n\nTo start, develop clear and equitable cyberloafing HR policies. Set expectations on the amount of time or circumstances where non-work-related internet activities would be allowed either on an employee’s personal device or the company’s equipment. Be sure to clearly note the websites and social media that would be prohibited.\n\nAnd rather than just address an employee’s actual cyberloafing behavior, try digging deeper into the “why” with them.\n\n“Managers need to be more understanding of why someone might go to their phone or use the internet during a time they should be productive at work.”\n\n“There are so many motivations that go into cyberloafing. So, to really understand how to stop it or manage it, you need to know the motivations behind it,” Frimpong said.\n\nIn some cases, for example, employees may lack the self-awareness to know they are using social media at work because they feel ostracized by their teammates, but in other cases, they might be aware of this reason. In either situation, the issue should be discussed with the employee’s manager, Mason said.\n\nWays to Prevent Cyberloafing\n\nSet expectations on when non-work-related internet activities are allowed, and on which devices.\n\nClearly note websites and social media that are prohibited.\n\nIdentify triggers for employees who might be engaging in non-work-related internet activities to reduce emotional or physical issues.\n\nHave open conversations with employees to understand why they may be resorting to cyberloafing.\n\n“Managers need to be more understanding of why someone might go to their phone or use the internet during a time they should be productive at work,” Mason told Built In. “There should be open communication between you and your employees to understand why they are doing these actions.”\n\nFor employees who turn to cyberloafing to improve their well-being or to reduce emotional or physical discomfort, it comes down to identifying the triggers for those behaviors and then addressing them through conversations with the employee in question.\n\nIn cases where cyberloafing is excessive and interfering with meeting deadlines or completing projects, it can be useful to explore the problem through another lens.\n\n“You have to look at cyberloafing as the same way you would diagnose mental illness,” Mason said. “If it gets in the way of your everyday life, then it’s excessive. If it’s stopping you from meeting your deadlines and doing your everyday job, it’s excessive.”",

I live in a very small town but have a specialized background (DevOps). I’m glad I made the decision to go full-remote. The room for growth, benefits, work/life balance, and pay were all better than anything I could find locally.\n\nHere is another pro-tip regarding looking up remote positions:\n\nWhen using Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Indeed, etc. search using their “Remote” flag to find remote positions.\n\nHowever, also be sure to look for positions in “Remote, OR”\n\nSome recruiters don’t list them correctly, or something gets messed up when copying the job listing all over (from one service to another). Typically these remote jobs (with positions listed in ‘Remote, OR’) have less applicants. Also Remote, Oregon is a small town so luckily it’s easy to see if the position was intended for the actual town or for “Remote”\n\n### Comment ID jd7pcz6 with +1 score by [(tennisguy163, Reddit, 2023-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/jd7pcz6/) (in reply to ID hm2b17u):\nGood god, one job on there has over 5,000 applicants.

Zip recruiter is nice where employers can “like” your resume or application, rate it, give feedback, and even contact you through it to say “you look qualified for our position. You should apply.” Not all employers use those tools but the ones who did use it made the process feel more personable than just 1-tap applying and hoping for a response.\n\n### Comment ID hm2q2rb with +32 score by [(OverlordWaffles, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm2q2rb/) (in reply to ID hm1xq2t):\nZip Recruiter and Dice can suck it. I started getting spammed with emails and phone calls from Indian recruiters *constantly*. I think I was getting a call like every 2 hours and would even go as late as midnight trying to call and get me to take some call center or desktop support position, which would be both a downward move with a paycut. \n\nOnce I removed my info from them the onslaught tapered off and faded.\n\nETA: Oh, I forgot to add that none of the positions they wanted to talk about were local, all out of state and no remote, so I would have to move\n\n#### Comment ID hm3odej with +12 score by [(boethius70, Reddit, 2021-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm3odej/) (in reply to ID hm2q2rb):\nYea the ship sailed on Dice at least 10 years ago.

Full time.  Last year during full on covid.\n\nLinkedIn, Indeed, and a network of recruiters I have come to know from many contracts I have done.  \n\nIndeed was the worst, and normally was just cross posts and never used the Indeed built in system\n\nLinkedIn was actually pretty awesome with the open to work feature and their revamped job searching. \n\nMy recruiter network got me a handful of interviews  and an offer.\n\nLinkedIn recruiter who got in touch with me actually got me the position, so a huge win for LinkedIn. I used the offer I had to knock my pay up even more.  Thanks job I was never going to take!\n\nThese recruiters use tools to search LinkedIn profiles for keywords, so your profile can literally make or break you.  These recruiters don't understand what x buzzword is. They spend seconds on your profile to see if you are a possible match and move on, so your profile should be as complete as possible..  Have some project work to give them an idea of what kind of work you can do.\n\nThe better my profile was, the more I got random recruiters  to contact me, and about better jobs.\n\nThis is the way now.  Learn it and get a better job.\n\n### Comment ID hmuxmau with +1 score by [(nicepersondonthate, Reddit, 2021-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hmuxmau/) (in reply to ID hm2lnfx):\nenjoy being replaced soon, since you used the \"i got another job offer card\", can only use that once then you are on their shit list.

That wasn't the point of the comment, though I guess I could have worded it better.  It was meant to be a quick response for OP's question.\n\nWhat actually happened in my case was that I received an offer for a higher paying job at a larger company.  At the same time I actually really liked the team and hit it off with the CIO at a smaller company, offering less.  I negotiated informing the smaller company that I really wanted the position, but that I had another offer at a higher pay.  The smaller company came back that if we wrapped the deal up immediately they would come up and match.\n\nIt wasn't that they didn't value me, they had a price they offered for the position.  On the contrary...They liked me, I liked them, but I informed them I had a higher offer.  They thought I was worth it and went above their original salary offer.\n\nAlmost two years in, I still love the position, love the team, have a much better work/life balance than had I taken the first offer, and so wouldn't change a thing.\n\nInforming a prospective employer that you have an existing offer, and negotiating to get yourself better pay/benefits/etc. seems is pretty standard.  Was it risky?  Sure, it had elevated risk that the job I really wanted to get would leave the table, but it was something I took a chance on, and it instead validated my belief that they did value me.  Also, I had no duty to the first company, and simply informed them I would be taking another offer.  No bridges burnt, so cards used, no shit list necessary.  It's just business.  \n\nI don't really think \"the proper amount\" exists.  We negotiate with what employers feel we are worth from a multitude of reasons and what that is can be different for the same person at the same positions at various companies.\n\n## Comment ID hm27j7q with +4 score by [(Zengaroni, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm27j7q/) (in reply to ID r1ynlc):\nI have always used LinkedIn.

Check out their websites. Apply to the gigs. Contact their recruiters on linkedin asking about the gig and if they are still hiring (e.g. get noticed.) Sometimes this can help you rise to the top.\n\nUltimately the job posting sites typically have lots of applicants. Often recruiting at places is poor and doesn't list in the right way or doesn't list anywhere but their own website, or they go through 3rd parties which don't tell you who you are working for up front.\n\nYou can get a job from many ways, just trying to offer an alternative method i've seen work. :)\n\n## Comment ID hm3iprg with +2 score by [(Big-Sploosh, Reddit, 2021-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm3iprg/) (in reply to ID r1ynlc):\nSpeaking as someone based in the US:\n\nLinkedIn and just applying directly on the company website.  Occasionally I'll use Indeed, but a lot of times it will just take you to the company career page anyway, use Indeed to find companies rather than single job postings.  There is also USAJobs if you are looking into 2210 series jobs for federal agencies, some hiring more frequently than others (Bureau of Land Management, Indian Health Service, EPA, and in the worst case scenario; the Bureau of Prisons...)

Any app in most languages can be coded to be \"distributed\" both on the scale of within a single machine and at the scale of deploying multiple small instances of it. (eg Kubernetes, running it on multiple EC2s etc etc)\n\nAs for \"fault tolerant\": \"The unavoidable truth about software in production is that things will go wrong. Even more when we take network, file systems, and other third-party resources into account. To react to failures, Elixir supervisors describe how to restart parts of your system when things go awry, going back to a known initial state that is guaranteed to work\"\n\nDon't entirely understand this either. In a run of the mill corporate Java app, if you experience an exception eg calling another service, unless you're doing something very strange, your app will not stop running, it will just keep error logging those exceptions until the problem is resolved. (whether by the target service coming back online or you send out a fix for the call or whatever) Really the only time an app will outright crash and completely stop is if it experiences errors attempting to boot in the first place, and the correct solution there is to not allow instances that don't respond 200 OK on /health to take traffic. You certainly don't want to attempt restart the system as it won't do any good.\n\nSo I'm left wondering, am I missing something or is there really not much to the claims about Erlang and Elixir? Don't get me wrong, this is not me criticizing Erlang or Elixir or the hype machine around them, every language has to have marketing and that's fine. It's also not me advocating corporate Java (shudder) - I'm just using it as an example of a common technology that also seems to tick all the same boxes as Erlang and Elixir as far as these claims go.\n\n## Comment ID jkevion with +40 score by [(DavidOfTheNorth, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/13jfctn/whats_special_about_erlang_and_elixir/jkevion/) (in reply to ID 13jfctn):\nOf the top of my head the only other dynamic, functional language that has any real usage is scheme.   \n\n\nBut aside from that these are, broadly reasonable questions.

It's just a bit more accessible than in most other languages because the language and standard library were built for concurrency, whereas in most other mainstream languages it's tacked on as an afterthought. In theory you could do the same thing that elixir does anywhere, but you'd have to build it and sometimes actively fight language semantics (e.g. a big part of why elixir has relatively easy concurrency is the absence of globally mutable state, if you're in a language that does have that you need to develop patterns around avoiding it and dealing with situations where you can't because you're interfacing with existing code that doesn't follow your rules).\n\n(that said, some algorithms also just straight up do not work without interior mutability, so depending on what you end up doing you'll find that elixir semantics get in your way too, it's all a matter of what you're doing on a daily basis).\n\n#### Comment ID jkgbvls with +2 score by [(mr_corn, Reddit, 2023-05-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/13jfctn/whats_special_about_erlang_and_elixir/jkgbvls/) (in reply to ID jkezv73):\nYes, the special thing is called the OTP, which is the runtime.

It's a great primer to understand these claims more.\n\nThis comment is not intended to be an exhaustive list of arguments. I just want to provide some light on each of these 3 claims:\n\n**Low-latency:** I think you overlook this by saying \"everything is low-latency\". Sure that's true when there's no load. But what happens when a system is under load or a single request is hogging the system? The BEAM uses preemptive schedulers to give fair-share of CPU to each request. You can quite literally run infinite loops in production without affecting other requests. If you tried doing that in most other languages, I don't think it would work.\n\n**Distributed:** The BEAM lets you distribute across nodes out of the box. No additional libraries or software needed. It's baked into the language (well, via OTP) directly. I'm not sure about the Java ecosystem, but this really isn't a thing in other languages I've used. Typically you'd distribute many languages via Redis PubSub.\n\nBut, there's another aspect to distributed which is worth talking about. The BEAM lets you distribute your application into sub-applications very easily. You can build standalone micro-applications that all run and work together in a single deployment. This goes beyond what K8S does because you can literally run thousands of \"micro apps\" under one roof. (That would be a lot, but just sharing as an example.)\n\nThis property has completely changed how I think about writing programs. And it's quite literally impossible in most other languages. Again, I don't know enough about modern Java to tell you what's possible there.\n\n**Fault-Tolerant:** Fred Hebert's blog post about this is great: [https://ferd.ca/it-s-about-the-guarantees.html](https://ferd.ca/it-s-about-the-guarantees.html)\n\nFault-tolerance in a BEAM application is about having a stable-start state that you can work from. It's a guarantee that the system can recover if you can always get into this stable state.\n\nA lot of code in other language goes into handling failure. Just look at most DB pooling libraries, for example. You can get a lot of that for \"free\" on the BEAM.\n\n### Comment ID jkf0gso with +24 score by [(sb8244, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/13jfctn/whats_special_about_erlang_and_elixir/jkf0gso/) (in reply to ID jkf077k):\nDistributed could also refer to distributing across a CPU, btw. There's application distribution (micro apps under one roof), network distribution (connect nodes, service discovery, etc), and CPU distribution (go across all cores seamlessly).\n\nOne of the BEAM's greatest strengths is that it will seamlessly scale across all CPU cores you give it access to. Of course, you can footgun yourself into messing this up.

BEAM is a virtual machine but one that’s been tuned for nearly a half century.  It is exceptionally fast and JIT is improving with every release. Default measurements are taken in microseconds.  The other aspect of low latency is in combination with distributed. \n\nDistributed.  This is much more first class than in other programming environments.  Nodes (that’s the term for a single instance of a BEAM VM) keep a persistent connection to the other nodes in its distribution.  This makes the low latency truly low latency.  When two process on different machines want to communicate they do so over a persistent low latency distribution protocol which natively understands all the native terms of erlang / elixir.  This is also deeply baked into the language, you can do basically all the same stuff with a pid whether it’s local to your node or remote on another node.  Compared to many other programming environments where distributed programming often means running servers and manually plumbing together some mix of http / grpc / thrift / fill in your favorite protocol servers and clients to communicate, this level of native distribution support is unparalleled.\n\nLastly we arrive at fault-tolerant.  Erlang and elixir programs are structured as share nothing actors called “processes” that are managed in a “Supervision Tree.”  This is where the terminology “let it crash” comes from.  It is often a reasonable method to just not handle unexpected cases, allow the process to crash, and get restarted by its supervisor.  Native support in the VM for process linking and monitoring along with supervision trees give elixir and erlang programmers powerful primitives to construct rock solid systems that can survive all kinds of faults.\n\nIt is a very different way to construct distributed fault tolerant software than the DIY model that most languages provide for you.  I’d suggest reading the [OTP Design Principles](https://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/des_princ.html) to learn more about what makes it unique\n\n## Comment ID jkgr50z with +18 score by [(northrupthebandgeek, Reddit, 2023-05-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/13jfctn/whats_special_about_erlang_and_elixir/jkgr50z/) (in reply to ID 13jfctn):\nThe one key feature - that very few other languages/runtimes have replicated - is the use of preemptively-scheduled processes instead of threads, coroutines, etc.  The main implications here:\n\n- They are processes, so they *do not* have access to each others' memory; they communicate by sending messages to one another\n\n- They are preemptively-scheduled, meaning one process cannot (without invoking natively-compiled code) block the execution of other processes; a long-running process will *automatically* yield as necessary\n\nThe rest of the marketed features of Erlang - the supervision trees restarting processes when they crash, the distribution of processes across cores and machines, all the other stuff contributing to Erlang's reputation of fault-tolerance and scalability and low-latency - hinge on that one core feature of preemptively-scheduled isolated processes.\n\nThis is also why...\n\n> Let's skip over \"low-latency\", because virtually all programming languages and VMs are \"low-latency\".\n\n...Erlang is very different on this front, and why you probably don't want to skip over the \"low-latency\" claim.  Because the EVM preemptively schedules process execution, it reduces a lot of the high latency resulting from long-running threads; those threads will *automatically* yield and let other threads run.\n\nSay you have three processes in an infinite loop: one that takes 10 seconds per iteration, and two that each take 1 second per iteration.  In a cooperatively-scheduled language runtime, all those processes have to run one after the other, so *all* of them end up with a latency of 12 seconds per iteration.  Not so with Erlang: the EVM will pause each process after it burns through its budget for computations (or \"reductions\", in Erlang parlance), so those shorter processes can get much closer to actually running 1 iteration per second despite executing alongside the giant 10-second-long-iteration process, *even with only a single core / OS thread*.\n\n## Comment ID jkfi152 with +13 score by [(markmark206, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/13jfctn/whats_special_about_erlang_and_elixir/jkfi152/) (in reply to ID 13jfctn):\n\\[For some context: I wrote / shipped a lot of C++ (up to 2013ish), then Python and Golang, and I first used Elixir at a startup in 2017.

I don't know erlang.\\]\n\nAll these claims make sense to me, and there are some great answers and explanations here on this thread, but for me, the features of Elixir lang / BEAM VM / the ecosystem boil down to:\n\n1. high developer productivity (=> I can ship more functionality faster, with a smaller team), and\n2. high developer satisfaction (=> I find writing in Elixir delightful),\n3. code bugs of certain types are really hard to implement (=> the code has fewer bugs, the codebase is cheaper to maintain),\n4. you absolutely *can*, as Sasa Juric said in his talk \"[The Soul of Erlang and Elixir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBT4XBdoUE)\", *start simple, go far* (=> the system is much simpler and cheaper to run than it would be w a different stack).\n\nThe implications of these points are significant: you can get a lot done with a tiny team, fast, with low overall cost of running the system over time.

This has the effect of cleaning up the code and allowing you to focus on its intent rather than its exception handling. Look at golang for example. It’s littered with so many if err!=nil checks everywhere. In Java you have entire exception blocks, checked/unchecked exceptions, etc. \n\nIn elixir you often just use pattern matching to handle unexpected scenarios, and I find myself spending a lot less time thinking about how to defend against weird edge cases like I do in other languages. There are entire classes of faults that you can just kind of ignore, knowing that your supervision tree can handle the worst of them. \n\nThe profound effect of this is that the code you read is the code that is important. You can fit more of it on one screen and you can reason about it unencumbered by so much distracting error-handling structures.\n\n### Comment ID jki2skt with +3 score by [(IanArcad, Reddit, 2023-05-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/13jfctn/whats_special_about_erlang_and_elixir/jki2skt/) (in reply to ID jkgsoel):\nThat's a good point and I'd even go a little further - it's not just error handling, it's metaprogramming in general.

I would even say that Let It Crash as a catchphrase has done some non-zero cultural harm in addition to whatever marketing impact it has had.\n\nIME (going to be 10 years soon!) you will absolutely still write plenty of error handling code in Elixir. Sometimes out of necessity, sometimes voluntarily to improve rigor or the end user feedback. Writing unhappy-path code is not a problem we can escape from if you're aiming to write resilient and high quality software, it's just the shape of things you *have* to care about will shift and maybe narrow some. There are plenty of scenarios where just letting processes crash altogether on a MatchError or whatever is still going to be detrimental to the system health and thus kind of sloppy, and I'd say it's not that rare.\n\nI've worked with folks earlier in their career who had something of the wrong takeaway from this kind of sentiment, and felt that kind of teenager sense of invincibility that some of us experienced.

I feel like elixir/erlang/OTP/beam give us some very powerful tools that just don’t exist in other tech stacks, or at least not to nearly the same degree. The stack is often lauded for its metaprogramming and hot code reloading as well. These seem pretty incredible coming from other mainstream stacks, and it takes a bit when you’re new to learn that you should be very careful and very deliberate about using them. \n\nWhen it comes to the error handling topic, this is mainly just an observation from comparing a couple of decades of other languages to what I see of elixir code after using it since around 1.2. I don’t think we should advertise elixir as a place where you don’t do error/exception handling, but I definitely do see a very different kind of readability when it comes to common error handling idioms in the language.\n\n### Comment ID m3yn4zi with +1 score by [(CatolicQuotes, Reddit, 2024-12-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/13jfctn/whats_special_about_erlang_and_elixir/m3yn4zi/) (in reply to ID jkgsoel):\ndo you mean with pattern matching you do railway type architecture? did you try f# and how do you compare?\n\n## Comment ID jkf3jmz with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/13jfctn/whats_special_about_erlang_and_elixir/jkf3jmz/) (in reply to ID 13jfctn):\nThese features you gloss over often correspond to very specific things in Erlang/Elixir.\n\n- low latency - usually this actually refers to the way threads are scheduled by the VM (preemptively). This is somewhat unusual as far as VMs go and is optimized for latency over throughput. This is why Erlang and Elixir have very peculiar performance characteristics\n- distributed - this refers to location transparency, which you get from the actor model. This has nothing to do with microservices or Kubernetes, and is not something you can easily replicate with such things. In Java, you'd need Java RMI or Akka or something to accomplish something that approaches this, but even then, with BEAM the entire runtime is designed around these features.\n- fault tolerant - OTP-style applications are structured as a supervision tree, which nicely segregates processes from error handling, and forces you to think upfront about how errors will propagate as subsystems fail. This is the most easily thing lifted to other languages, and it's a nice way to structure applications that I copy in my day job (Scala).\n\n## Comment ID jkf1x4d with +6 score by [(Rainbowlovez, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/13jfctn/whats_special_about_erlang_and_elixir/jkf1x4d/) (in reply to ID 13jfctn):\nNo one is arguing that distributed computing isn't possible for any comparison languages. The claim about Elixir/Erlang is that, because of the use of a BEAM Process as a primitive & concurrency achieved by message passing between those primitives, it allows for more opaqueness when one Process communicates with another Process, because there's no substantive difference/cognitive overhead for the programmer whether they happen to reside in the same BEAM node or separate BEAM nodes on the same or different machines. Additionally, the work done by these Processes is scheduled fairly to the CPU, which is not done by default in other languages; not strictly a distributed feature of Elixir, but it's something that other programming languages may need to solve for when they support highly concurrent/distributed architectures (deadlocks, race conditions, etc.) that is trivial for Elixir.\n\nIn your example, fault tolerance is gained in the comparison language through defensive programming and error handling. In Elixir, it's a consequence of the concurrency primitives enabled by Beam/OTP, allowing you to \"let it crash\" with a specialized actor responsible for restarting. I think part of the dissonance might be that the Beam/OTP programming model (Process-based actors) is able to support highly stateful applications in a way that is not as simple to achieve in other programming languages without additional frameworks or backing services, and fault tolerance has different implications along the axis of how stateful your application is.\n\n## Comment ID jkf3qea with +5 score by [(Successful-Finger-16, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/13jfctn/whats_special_about_erlang_and_elixir/jkf3qea/) (in reply to ID 13jfctn):\nI think the difference between Erlang and other languages is a bit the same as Linux vs. QNX (microkernel).\n\nInstead of threads and shared memory you run processes and message passing. This gives you easy concurrency (no locks and such), separation (a segfault in a thread will crash you program, in a process only that process), fail tolerance (process fails just start it again). The distributed refers to that it is completely transparant if you want to run a process (thread in other systems) on a different node. So if you have the right processes it becomes trivial to run your program across nodes or a single node, however you want it. \n\nI like how qnx and erlang focus on minimizing MTTR instead of solely MTTF.

The development process itself is completely rethought from the ground up compared to every other language. It’s more like a platform for building systems. It’s not just about microservices spread across several programs or machines; it’s more like nano-services within a single program. What would be a small monolithic application in other languages becomes a nano-service distributed system in Elixir/Erlang, where every part can fail independently, and it doesn’t matter. These small processes are easily scalable and can be distributed across multiple machines, whether within the same environment or globally.\n\nYou can build self-healing systems that never crash. You can create systems that share state with other systems, and it's built into the language itself in a way that’s fast, scalable, and very, very safe. In other languages, you usually only get the 'logic,' and everything else must be handled by you or external libraries—which probably won’t share the same primitives or philosophy. In the BEAM VM & OTP (the Erlang/Elixir platform), everything you need to build such systems is already baked into the languages.\n\nThat's why Discord could operate with just 5 engineers working in Elixir. And that’s why the biggest messaging service in the world, WhatsApp, relies on Erlang.\n\n## Comment ID jkypmns with +2 score by [(kerneleus, Reddit, 2023-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/13jfctn/whats_special_about_erlang_and_elixir/jkypmns/) (in reply to ID 13jfctn):\nDisclaimer: I don’t use Elixir for commercial work, I’m just curious about it. My current main backend lang is Go.\n\nThere are many things for each dev. If you with nodejs, your benefits in one part. If you using Java, you have others. As you might know, modern distributed systems stack usually based on: k8s, metrics with something like prometheus/grafana from your app and k8s nodes (to get bare metal ram/cpu usage), logs with elk stack, traces, kafka for distributed messages between your [micro]services, db, like PG (with pgbouncer, of course), redis, frontend with vue/react, and so on. Each thing need skills, years of practice and you, just, cannot know everything.\nUsually you can solve some part of your problems with language. Like, use Go, instead of NodeJS/Python, and you have tests, benchmarks, multicore processing out of the box, but you still need k8s to run your distributed system, or docker. It doesn’t matter what exactly. You need Kafka/NATS/Rmq/zmq to make distributed async architecture. Of course you can make monolithic app with go, use channels to communicate between parts of your app, but usually its microservices in k8s. Yes, it’s more customizable system. You can use special tools, like Elasticsearch, Airflow, Neo4j, for any needs there are lots of tools. Yes, if you have a lot of engineers you can make independent teams for each part of a system. But what if you don’t? What if you’re a startup. But you want to make good event sourcing model, for example. With good architecture that scales and do it’s job at some point you will take lots of engineers, split processes out of your OTP app and make them microservices in k8s.\nFor my experience the main special thing of Elixir/OTP is benefits for startups. You can make good scaleable app with modern features, like realtime here and there, events in your system and other marketing things, that others told with less resources. It’s like fullstack, but with frontend, backend, devops and dba. There are drawbacks too. For me it’s lack of my experience with Phoenix/Elixir, Go is more popular, that means more tools and people, easier distribution with binary.\n\n## Comment ID lrlho9c with +1 score by [(mshirman, Reddit, 2024-10-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/13jfctn/whats_special_about_erlang_and_elixir/lrlho9c/) (in reply to ID 13jfctn):\nyou should explore the foundation behind beam VM, history of Erlang (being a full tolerant solution for telco applications), and actor based paradigm.

Java is a systems language - statically typed, compiled, capable of creating large data structures, etc.  Elixir is a scripting language - dynamically typed, interpreted (more or less) via a VM/runtime.\n\nOf course, if we could build every application in a systems language, we would - I really like coding in C++ for example and definitely think Go is something special.  It's fun to count CPU cycles, use vector instructions, build your own allocators, build objects and interfaces, etc etc.  But if your goal is to get something that works up and running, a scripting language will get you to that point so much faster, and when the requirements change (which they always do), you'll be able to make those changes faster too.  Basically the point of scripting languages is that you don't have to rely on some corporate behemoth to build the software that you need right now.\n\n> every language has to have marketing and that's fine.\n\nWell, it's fine if the marketing matches the use case and gives you some insights as to where the language is a better choice over other languages.  I absolutely hate Rust's marketing because it doesn't do that at all, the community just trashes other languages as \"unsafe\".  I'm also told that Java's \"write once run anywhere\" was also an example where the reality didn't match the marketing, although truthfully I haven't really used it recently.\n\nBut yes, elixir's marketing matches up with its capabilities.  It is a compiled scripting language (like Ruby or Perl) with significant metaprogramming that lets you write apps that are collections of processes that run on nodes of distributed systems.  It's well suited to web projects because every request runs independently  in its own process, but can also easily communicate with other processes as it needs to.  It is also fast - I've gotten 100K requests / second from a Phoenix server in simple \"hello world\" testing.  It is a worthy competitor to Ruby & Python with advantages in some areas and disadvantages in others.  (Library availability, and the fact that functional programming isn't natural for a lot of people).\n\n> Any app in most languages can be coded to be \"distributed\" both on the scale of within a single machine and at the scale of deploying multiple small instances of it.\n\nAre you sure about that?  In Elixir / Erlang, concurrency / messaging isn't part of some third party library, it is integrated into the language itself and you get some significant benefits from that (like you should never get timeouts or race conditions).  The only language that I know that has something similar is Go, with its goroutines & channels.  Of course those are designed to run on the same machine, not distributed across a network.\n\n## Comment ID jkgqw9e with +1 score by [(flummox1234, Reddit, 2023-05-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/13jfctn/whats_special_about_erlang_and_elixir/jkgqw9e/) (in reply to ID 13jfctn):\ndistributed - you can connect two nodes and load and run code on another node from the first node and leverage the results on the first node, e.g. geographically dispersed nodes running code on a remote master and responding in low latency. [Fly.io did a talk on this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqnZnFpxLjI&t=931s). IME there aren't many languages that do this without significant setup or abstraction or additional libraries. Comparing something that is built into a language and is easy to use to kubernetes is laughable. Kubernetes takes a team of people to setup and maintain properly and is a considerable amount of abstractions itself. Erlang's version is just built in for free and ready for you to use. A better comparison might be something like clustered elastic search but even then it's not an accurate comparison as that's essentially just a k/v store.  \n\nLow latency - you shouldn't assume elixir is like other languages. IMO you should look more into this one. There is a reason erlang is used to great effect on telecom switch infrastructure and works great for things like [IoT embedded systems](https://nerves-project.org/). Thanks to Nerves I finally have a use for all those random tiny capacity SD cards I have lying around.   \n\nfault tolerant - Erlang's got a proven track record over decades being used in switches. Yes things go wrong in production but since Erlang's mantra is \"let it fail\" you end up with fault tolerant systems that leverage Supervision trees and can do hot code reloading with fallback to known working code. We're talking about fault tolerance within the system itself not in access external things. IME Java will sit there and gladly eat up all your memory and cpu and eventually crash or deadlock a server when it runs amok so I'm not sure what you're even trying to say here by comparing it to Java hitting a failing a sevice. We're more talking about a method within a JVM being called and failing and then crashing the JVM, i.e. when YOUR code fails. You could put try/catches on every method but do you? And if you do how much extra code are you adding to your application to guard failures? That's just a feature of Erlang/Elixir.    \n\nAlso you forgot concurrency \n\nconcurrency - JVM threads are not equivalent to [erlang processes](https://www.erlang.org/doc/getting_started/conc_prog.html). Also see [Elixir tasks](https://dev.to/felipearaujos/the-power-of-elixir-task-module-54np). It's easy to use and leverage even across distributed nodes.  \n\nBased on a lot of your comments. Yes you are missing something and while I understand you're trying to equate things in elixir/erlang to things in other that languages you may know I think you're selling yourself short by doing that. \n\nAlso keep in mind Erlang implemented a lot of these things that you probably take for granted within OTP/BEAM before they were widely available in other products. It kind of reminds me of how a lot of people I know criticize the Apple keyboard layout for being different than a Windows keyboard and wondering why Apple changed it without realizing Apple keyboard layouts were a thing before Windows even existed. 🤷🏻‍♂️\n\nYou should try the language(s) for yourself though and see how you like them or don't. Not everything is for everyone. A lot of the \"hype\" is justified in my opinion but I also feel it's important to remember that Erlang isn't some [johnny come lately language](https://youtu.be/BXmOlCy0oBM)  (despite the timestamp IIRC this movie was made in the 80s or early 90s).\n\n### Comment ID jknz1g8 with +1 score by [(bedobi, Reddit, 2023-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/13jfctn/whats_special_about_erlang_and_elixir/jknz1g8/) (in reply to ID jkgqw9e):\nappreciate the detailed reply\n\nmaybe I didn't make it clear enough but as mentioned I'm really really not trying to criticize or belittle Erlang/Elixir at all, I was just genuinely at loss as to what's actually special about it - the way things are popularly described aren't detailed enough to really get a grip on if we're talking about legitimate differences or just marketing hype fluff that really isn't meaningfully different from other languages\n\nwith you reply and the others here and on hackernews I have a better understanding and I agree it is indeed meaningfully different and better - the claims are true, the hype is justified\n\nif I was to criticize anything, what I would criticize is exactly this lack of detail in the popular claims and marketing - IMO the community needs to do a better job of explaining the differences vs other technologies.\n\nI completely understand it's a bit rich of me, who know nothing about this tech, to come in here an say that, but the alternative is that countless people like me will remain unaware at best or mistakenly skeptical at worst\n\n#### Comment ID jkpwrki with +1 score by [(flummox1234, Reddit, 2023-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/13jfctn/whats_special_about_erlang_and_elixir/jkpwrki/) (in reply to ID jknz1g8):\nhope I didn't come across as negative.

So let me give you an example.  In Python you hit a MemoryError.  At this point your app is pretty much toast.  There is no way, i believe, to \\*KNOW\\* if your app is in a bad state.  The OS has told you something has gone wrong, in this case, allocating memory.   This exception is really for you to wind things down.  In some cases, your app may continue working but it would be unwise to believe it's in a known good state.  The process must be restarted.\n\nNow.  Erlang just says \"throw\" away the process and restart.  But its way more than that.  Erlang can do many things concurrently, so the primitive isn't a process but something much finer grain.  Since this Way Of Doing Things (tm) is the norm you are pushed into the direction of building applications that are highly resilient.  Something horribly wrong goes wrong but the state can be thrown away.  Its way more nuanced than that.  There are inter-process communication controls, process supervision, persistence.  The system  comes out of the box with a ton of functionality.  \n\nI believe there are few attempts to do this in interpreted languages for two reasons:\n\n1. By the time the person has really understood the problem they are solving.  They realize the number of caveats and workarounds to solve it in the interpreted language isn't really something viable.\n2. It is a massive effort.

The ease of unit-testing, and doing it concurrently with ease. The ability to replace all sorts of things that you normally have to deploy alongside a standard web app such as a job runner. The supervision trees. Mix is an excellent dev tool/dependency manager.\n\nit's just nice.",

Make a list of companies you want to work for, regardless of whether they currently have an appropriate job opening for you. Consult your network to see if you know anyone who works there, or who might know someone who works there. Conduct informational interviews with these people. Bookmark the company website career pages and subscribe to updates, if available. Apply directly to hiring managers instead of through the ATS. It's a lot more legwork than hitting the Apply button on a job listing, but it gives you more control over the process.\n\n#### Comment ID kspn1ll with +10 score by [(Keep-Moving-789, Reddit, 2024-02-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/kspn1ll/) (in reply to ID ivan0wk):\nHow do u go about finding who the hiring manager is and how to contact them?\n\n#### Comment ID lhpf73q with +16 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/lhpf73q/) (in reply to ID ivan0wk):\n[removed]\n\n#### Comment ID l9g41l4 with +2 score by [(PipeOk1634, Reddit, 2024-06-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/l9g41l4/) (in reply to ID ivan0wk):\nHow do you find the companies you can work for?

You can even add which technologies you’ve utilized at roles the way LinkedIn is currently trying to add skills. Not all the jobs are technical, like programming or product management, but if you’re in the tech industry, that’s the niche the job board is in. \n\nSomething really nice about Otta is that they include the Glassdoor ratings for companies as well, which is great because sometimes startups, especially the earlier stage or ones with <500 employees, can be a bit dicey around inexperienced management and claiming work/life balance while in reality push the “hustle” mentality. \n\nThey’re great for finding Remote-based work as well, since a lot of startups/fast-paced growing companies don’t care yet about HR laws and regulations across different states, they care about the talent. Once companies get bigger and older, they typically only hire remotely from states where they have established entities because of all the paperwork and the need to stay up-to-date with individual state compliance.\n\n- Edited for clarity around tech industry/companies versus tech positions like programming.\n\n#### Comment ID ivb743n with +2 score by [(that_writer_dream, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/ivb743n/) (in reply to ID ivb0vfu):\nThey actually work with a pretty even amount of start-ups and large companies (Deliveroo, Bumble, Spotify, the Financial Times).

It's helped me land several interviews whereas on the company website you can easily get screened out. Apply on BOTH LinkedIn and the company website.\n\nThe benefit of LinkedIn easy apply is that for several companies (not all) let you just send in a resume without any additional info unlike the company site where you have to waste time copying your resume. Also, if you are getting screened out, recruiters can see your resume more easily through LinkedIn especially if you are one of the first applications. You often get notified if your resume gets read or downloaded, which doesn't mean anything, but gives you additional data on what types of roles and companies are interested.\n\nI've landed two solid jobs through LinkedIn easy apply.

If an offer sounds too good to be true, if the wording feels awkward and overly vague, etc.\n\nMuch of this knowledge just comes from being in an industry for a while and recognizing the normal way roles are talked about. \n\nThat said, here’s the steps I would recommend for everyone:\n\n1. Do enough research into your industry to recognize the standard job title naming conventions and job scope for your level. For example, an entry level marketing role is typically going to be called something like “marketing associate” or “marketing coordinator”, or more specific depending on branch of marketing, so “content marketing associate” etc. For job scope, there will be a few things in your industry that you’ll learn are red flags. For marketing, if they talk about outbound calling, prospecting, sales, etc. then it’s likely a sales role pretending to be a marketing role. If you don’t know what these red flags are in your industry, reach out to a more senior member of this industry through LinkedIn and ask them directly, “what red flags should I watch out for in job postings?”\n\n2. Assuming you find a role that passes the job title and job scope test, start Googling the company. Search for things like “ X company reviews” and “X company scam”. Then visit 1. The companies Glassdoor page 2. The company’s LinkedIn page 3. The company’s website\n\n2a. Does there Glassdoor have multiple positive reviews, salaries listed, etc? (If the company is a small startup, they may have limited info here but still be legit).\n\n2b. Is the company findable on LinkedIn? Do they have many people who say they work there?  Click into these people and make sure they all seem legit. To they have previous experience at different companies? Do they seem to be active profiles?\n\n2c. Finally, visit their website. Does it seem to be a full website? (Not just one or two pages). Does the branding seem trustworthy? Then find the internal job listings page on the website. Is the job listing you saw also listed on their website? If not, there’s a chance that the company is legit, but scammers are pretending to be from the company when they’re not.\n\nIf after all of this, the company still seems legitimate, than apply! When interviewing, make sure you:\n 1. Meet the interviewers face-to-face or on a video chat sometime in the interview process (most start with a phone screen, that’s okay as long as you video chat later). \n2. Only communicate with email addresses that are linked to the company. Example: john@amazon.com. \n3. Don’t give any personal banking or social security # information until contracts have been signed and finalized and you feel 200% sure they are for real.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n### Comment ID ivbjona with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/ivbjona/) (in reply to ID iva7h7u):\nkey word.  \"Depending on industries\".  lol\n\n## Comment ID ivadsk1 with +11 score by [(bryanhernc, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/ivadsk1/) (in reply to ID ynpo8w):\nI’ve had good experiences with indeed and ZipRecruiter.

I got laid off a month ago and went back to the misery of job huntng on LinkedIn. \n\nI was working in tech before, so i knew there was a better way. I wanted to essentially create something that would check my CV, and find the most relevant jobs on the internet to return them back to me in seconds. Better than spending hours on LinkedIn reading irrelevant long job postings (even skimming them was boring)\n\nThe apps i found would use ai to apply to jobs for you and I found some scary reviews. Apparently they just send applications made with AI absolutely everywhere hoping you land one. They are playing a number game basically. \n\nI knew the tool had to be an assistant. not an automation. The only automation id allow would be the one that finds the relevant jobs for me. the cv and cover letter writing can be supported by AI but not fully generated by AI. Something like a draft at most.\n\nAnyways... long story short. I took matter into my own hands and created [wizapply.app](http://wizapply.app) . While still at its early stage, there is a beta version that helps you quickly review job postings and generate TLDR sumamries with job score match to quickly decide if you want to read the whole thing or just move on. Quickly.  \n  \nThe next version is aimed at fully building the web app that creates lists of relevant job lsitings in just seconds.   \n  \nCurious to know if this is something anyone here would use\n\n## Comment ID lhpz0mz with +2 score by [(Affectionate-Ad-7438, Reddit, 2024-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/lhpz0mz/) (in reply to ID ynpo8w):\nThe thing I hate is when, it says it's hiring but they are not...

The cost to hire you is paid by the employer. The more money they have to pay for you, the more they actually value you. Companies who are willing to pay the fee to hire you have invested in you and will respect you more and won’t be as difficult to get raises in the future.

I got my current job by finding a company I wanted to work for, cold-emailing someone at the company who went to my same undergrad, and basically asked him for career advice. Did that like 10-15 times before it worked though.\n\nEdit: just wanted to add a couple of related pointers: (1) Any connection with the person will work. Doesn’t need to be that you went to the same college. Could be same hometown, etc. LinkedIn, Google (using the advanced search function), and company bios are your friends here. (2) Some jobs are posted even though the company already has a candidate in mind. Might be for DEI reasons, or maybe they want to say “we had 100 applicants apply for this one job!” This is where networking really helps out, because they might consider you before the job is even posted. (3) Job hunting is a numbers game. I literally applied to 84 jobs during my first search. Keep a spreadsheet to organize your search.\n\n### Comment ID k883u3z with +6 score by [(throwaway2929839392, Reddit, 2023-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/17pu8l3/other_than_indeed_where_do_yall_find_jobs_from/k883u3z/) (in reply to ID k87w4xz):\nWhat’s your industry?

Probably 3-4 days of labor. I charge $500/day, so about 2k. I think a professional paint job on this would be closer to 1500. You're going to want some good enamel paint. \n\nThis is a price of someone who isn't gouging you or selling themselves short. Maybe a smaller company with low overhead. Like the owner and a helper, or just the owner. I would be skeptical about the paint quality. I've never seen a finish carpenter put down professional level paint quality.\n\n#### Comment ID k6m0s0m with +19 score by [(streaksinthebowl, Reddit, 2023-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/17h295x/fair_quote_for_builtins/k6m0s0m/) (in reply to ID k6lyeux):\nYou’ve really got to spray to get a good paint finish on something like this.

They are more than likely RTA Cabinets. Still $1200 with markup is probably about right. And they come painted so you know they look good. \n\n4 RTA Cabinets, 2 sheets of plywood, and some 1x8 maple shelves with 1x2 face. The cabinet top is probably MDF. I doubt it's plywood. Not that the price is any different really. I could be wrong but I don't see anything overly difficult or custom about it. So I agree with you the biggest concern is probably this guys paint quality.

At $50 an hour for labor that is only 48 hours of work including install. If he is hand making all the cabinets, shaker doors, custom drawer boxes, etc the labor seems way low.

So many books and crannies. So that's one coat for primer and two for the paint.  \n\nI couldn't tell you how many hrs it took me to actually build the thing.

Though, I will say that my interview process has gone farther on average with LinkedIn (I pay for premium).  Recruiters are really hit and miss with that.  For IT, the 3rd party suburban recruiters are pretty brain dead - just want to fill the role so they get their commission, but don't understand what the job is about.  Much better luck with downtown companies and recruiters who genuinely dig into your skill set.

Another example was being approached for a copywriter position when the only thing close to that on my resume was that I had InDesign experience.  It's like, really?  You didn't even read the damn thing.  What really puts a recruiter above their peers though is when they spend time asking about my background and career objectives - it's really about building a relationship.  Sadly, too few get this.  I've gone out for coffee with a recruiter I knew nothing about, but they invited me, and the half hour with them was way more productive than any other phone call I've had otherwise.  In a way, it's like finding a normal personal/romantic relationship - you want someone who can adapt to your strengths and weaknesses.  Oh, and the other thing is how well they know the industry they are recruiting for.  I do give some leeway for IT though - understanding that if they were really good enough to completely know, let's say server administration, they probably wouldn't be a recruiter.

After two years, I found a non-profit that needed me more than I needed them. I took the job, and I like it but I could most likely make more working fast food. Still…it’s a job. 🤷‍♀️\n\n#### Comment ID l1y1xrm with +23 score by [(khantroll1, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1y1xrm/) (in reply to ID l1x4vlg):\nThere are jobs...they just aren't \"good\" jobs.

They now want to pay her 41,000 and think that's way to high. \n\nI don't know what happened but people were doing the same jobs 5 or 7 years ago making much more money than companies are offering now.\n\n### Comment ID l1wjkc9 with +4 score by [(EmoGothPunk, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1wjkc9/) (in reply to ID l1vvab8):\nThe field I'm looking to go to school for doesn't have freelance opportunities, but it's a field that'll always be in demand.

The job market is shit right now. You’re applying at the same time as *thousands? Tens of thousands?* of college students who are fresh out of college and looking for jobs. That will become less saturated soon. \n\n2. You’re likely looking for jobs that have the requirements you want. Be willing to take a job that seems “beneath you”. I applied as a bank teller 9 months ago earning $17.25, 6 months later I was earning $19. That may not seem like a ton, but it is steady income and with having roommates, only working 23 hours a week, I still earn $1600 a month and pay $400 in rent and utilities.

First, it’s so unbelievably easier to get a job when you have a job. But I also got a new job back in October after getting blindsided by layoffs at the company I was at - wasn’t just me but everyone on US payroll. \n\nHere are my suggestions. \n\nUse every platform, regardless. I never expected Indeed to work but that’s where I found the October job. Talk to recruiters even if it’s just to practice talking about yourself and learn about what’s going on out there in the world.\n\nInterviewing is like exercising, it gets easier and you get better at it if you do it all the time. Apply for everything. See it as a game to get interviews, even if you suspect it’s a bad fit. You never know, plus it’s great practice. You get to learn about the industry you’re applying to this way.\n\nRealize that luck plays a huge role. I got my job now because I interviewed for another company, got to a third round, then while having a really nice conversation with the interviewer we both realized I wasn’t what they were looking for. However, the interviewer knew of an opportunity at a related company (same source of startup funds) and said he’d forward my name since he thought I’d make a good colleague despite not being suited skills-wise for the role they were interviewing for. When he said that, I had zero expectations, thought maybe he was just letting me down gently (that definitely happens!). But lo and behold, he was true to his word and fast forward a few weeks and I’m at my new job. \n\nIn the meantime, work on the skills you need for this job. Even if it’s as general as reading books about “getting shit done” or how to communicate professionally. These are things people in the world of work are interested in learning about and make for things to talk about in interviews.\n\nThis job hunt shit is like trying to measure a piece of paper in the dark by throwing tiny stones at it. You need to throw as many stones as quickly as possible to get a sense of where you’re at. \n\nDid I want to give up? Did some people make me feel like an imposter? Was I having to regulate myself in good ways and bad throughout? Yes, yes, yes. \n\nYou got to just keep going while taking care of yourself.\n\n## Comment ID l1vkrvm with +8 score by [(214speaking, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1vkrvm/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nI’d say most of it is from knowing someone.

I work in talent acquisition and I am still hiring applicants myself. I hire in a large tech company and hire passive and applicant type of candidates. \n\nI am not saying this is a ground breaking but when my family and friends ask this is what I say. Pull the description of the job you are applying to and review the qualifications. Then the preferred qualifications. Then seriously take a look at your skills and experiences and consider objectively are they aligned and have you portrayed those skills with the bullet points and data to show the impact? If yes, then it is a resume issue. If not, you need to think about the employers perspective. \n\nI hate to put it simply, but a job is just about ROI for the company. They aren’t just hiring people for fun, they need to invest into you and they expect to get more value back. Show them how you provide value. It could be automating manual work, cost savings, revenue growth, operational efficiency, etc. \n\nThen I would apply to the job, reach out to the job poster / hiring manager, and I would message people doing the role now and see if they are open to chatting for ten minutes about their role and get a feel if you would even like it. If you’re sure you’d love it I would write a proposal / create a project or showcase of your work that is needed for the role and share it with the team or manager. \n\n\nThe market is tough right now, but businesses are growing and hiring.\n\n#### Comment ID l20a21j with +2 score by [(2boysmomOH, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l20a21j/) (in reply to ID l1yu27n):\nThis is exceptional advice.

I realize this is Reddit not a job application or networking email but I hope you are reviewing your professional communications for spelling, grammar, and syntax before sending.

Connecting with a recruiting agency or temp agency is also an option. Consider expanding your career options if only temporarily and look for jobs outside of what you’ve done in the past. Your past jobs include a lot of transferable skills in other roles or industries. Make sure you have a resume tailored to each job as well since that’s ultimately how resume are scanned - they match up keywords from the job posting.

I feel like I was having a lot of success and got a lot of interviews. I was still working at my last job so I was only open to clear steps up in career/pay, otherwise the time it took to get my new job would have been much less. I also had the benefit of recruiters calling me and messaging me on LinkedIn. \n\nI wanted to tell you a few things I noticed in my search that might help you: \n\nMany corporations seemed to be hiring for experienced legal assistants, contract admins, and project managers (that were actually legal assistants with odd titles) when I was looking. \n\nGet creative about searching LinkedIn titles that might apply to your skill set. Message recruiters if you can after you apply online. \n\nSearch “corporate governance” on LinkedIn, it seemed like this legal department across many orgs needed good help when I was looking. \n\nLook into contract admin roles. These jobs would be good for your skill set and usually pay well. \n\nGo to company websites (focusing on the F100 companies first, and then work your way through the F500 list) and manually scroll through their legal/admin/analyst/(insert whatever else your interested in) openings. There might be roles you’re missing on job boards due to weird new titles. \n\nMake sure your resume is tweaked to include as many terms from the job description as possible.\n\n## Comment ID l1ybafv with +3 score by [(yeahyeahyeah_okay, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1ybafv/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nIt took me months to get a call center job.

The job market has turned into a platform akin to Tinder, except the employer is the drop dead gorgeous blonde that gets 100+ messages an hour, and we are all the neckbeard \"nice guys\" lamenting how no one recognizes them and they deserve a date.\n\n  \nWhile I don't mean that we are all whiny, self-entitled, adult-children it is true that employers are seeing an increase in interest because we have made jobs excessively more accessible.  The traditional 40 hour work week is antiquated, we value showing up more than production in the workplace.  Why is this a problem?  With WFH becoming an increasingly viable option, people are able to take on 2, 3, and sometimes 4 jobs while still maintaining a high level of production while appearing to be \"at work\" 40 hours at all those jobs.\n\n  \nWith your current situation, WFH might not be the culprit but rather talent pool available in the area.  In a city as large as NYC, there is likely several hundred applicants to every job.  While you might think this puts you in a poor position, the truth is you will eventually find the right fit for you.  Consider this difficulty as a screening process on both ends.  It took me several hundred applications, multiple final interviews where I was ghosted, being told I was over and under qualified at the same time... but eventually I found the right fit for myself, my family, and my career.  Looking back, I was excited about a change not the company I was applying to.\n\n  \nThe hack is simple, keep applying and change your mindset from these being interviews to them being dates.  It is two sided, you need to like them as much as they like you.  Rejection is just one side or both realizing it isn't the best fit.  Don't take it personally, the same as having a date or two and realizing you don't find the person physically attractive or emotionally/intellectually stimulating enough to make them your long term relationship.\n\n## Comment ID l1xhbie with +2 score by [(gilgobeachslayer, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1xhbie/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nNetworking\n\n## Comment ID l1xinbu with +2 score by [(3Maltese, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1xinbu/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nHave Reddit take a look at your resume [https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/)\n\n## Comment ID l1xk8nd with +2 score by [(KriWee, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1xk8nd/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nI used to get people begging me for interviews on LinkedIn (I’ve gotten laid off a lot…) now it’s radio silence, even with a recruiter who my boss connected me with and sang my praises to personally.

Use LinkedIn and stuff not for the application process but to figure out who you can call at specific jobs to get a real human to talk to about your position and process.\n\n## Comment ID l1xqavl with +2 score by [(NoOneRightWayToLive, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1xqavl/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nFor my last switch, I decided what sector I wanted to work in and looked up a list of those companies in my country. So basically Googled variants of  things like 'Top 100 Healthcare companies in the USA'.\n\nI found a massive list of hundreds of those companies and went down the list applying to each one that had a role I was geographically qualified for and was generally in my skill and interest area. I usually went until I found around 10 jobs for the day that I had applied to. \n\nOn some days, rather than going down the list, I went to Google Maps and searched for healthcare companies near me as well and applied there. Same deal, I generally kept it to about 10 a day. \n\nSometimes I'd randomly search keywords of job duties I've enjoyed in the past on Linkedin jobs as well.\n\nI started getting interviews after probably 40-ish applications, so I put new applications on hold while I could see how the interviews panned out and course correct if needed. \n\nSmall note, make sure you've triple and quadruple checked your resume for typos - in your comments and post I see a number of those, and specifically for analytics / data which J saw you mention as a field of interest, even one typo on something like a resume would be a huge red flag, since it's incredibly important that things be accurate.\n\n## Comment ID l1xurwd with +2 score by [(ActiveDinner3497, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1xurwd/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nThe job search is a crazy recipe of networking, applying, and social media visibility anymore, not just submitting a resume. \n\nI’d check the following:\n\nIs your resume ATS friendly (no weird fonts, pics, tables, columns, etc)?\n\nAre your LI and Indeed profile settings optimized? I just tried to connect with a job seeker on LI and the only way I could was by entering HER email address to prove I knew her!! She was unwilling to share it. 😒\n\nDoes your LI profile contain key words from the job descriptions you were most excited about? \n\nDoes your resume contain the key words? \n\nHave you looked at other successful people in your field to see how their profile is built?\n\nHave you reached out to people you worked with or went to school with that would vouch for you? See if they have openings?\n\nAre you going to networking events to build relationships with peers? Get involved in your professional community. I try to hit two events a month. \n\nAre you volunteering or offering pro bono work to build additional experience and gain more contacts?\n\nAre you finding relevant content in your field that you agree with and reposting it on LI to gain visibility? I try to do this at least twice a week. \n\nJust some extra things to check out. I started looking hard a couple months ago and my market has been brutal for others in my role.

The best way to do that is let them know it's there. Submit the application, then send a message on LinkedIn, \"Hey, I wanted to let you know that I have submitted an application for 'XXX' It sounds like a great opportunity, let me know if we can connect for a chat'\n\n  \nSecond - stand out in the interview - small talk, make a joke, a unique perspective on something, connect with the recruiter\n\nThird - Follow up, 24-48 hours after the interview send an email, 'thanks for taking the time to chat with me, I really loved learning about x, y and z, I am even more excited about this opportunity now! I hope to hear back from you soon regarding next steps, have a great day!'\n\n  \nYou need to realise it's a numbers game, a recruiter will look at probably 1000 resumes per week, they will screen or interview 40-50+ people per week for a dozen different roles, these steps make sure the recruiter doesn't forget who you are.\n\n## Comment ID l1y84ev with +2 score by [(Truncated_Rhythm, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1y84ev/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nNetwork.

I believe the idea is that the process is so much more automated now and tracks down candidates by keywords, but there is a complete human element missing. I've hired tons of people in the past and a fair amount of them I would not have had I only gone by their resume with no interaction. I understand that companies are short-staffed these days but I do believe these same companies are missing out on true talent by relying on the automation to identify their candidates. Having been on the hiring side of things, I have found that there are some pretty underwhelming recruiters out there. There are intangibles people bring to the table that are not easily captured in a resume or cover letter no how many metrics you spew out on the documents.

It sucks but that's the job market for ya.\n\nBut like some people said, it's pretty evident that job postings are fake to get people's information, are posted only to hire internal candidates, or just are looking for someone with specific experience and expect them to be able to come in and do the job right away with minimal training.\n\nPeople are able to get in through the application process through nepotism. I've seen people get promoted to big roles without any experience and do a mediocre job moving on to director level jobs in the company. \n\nA lot of companies are making cutbacks for short-term profits, and it's working because they can dismiss an experienced worker because they have to compensate too much for them just to turn around and hire a junior scab and lowball them to come in. Then, they will put pressure on them to figure it out and expect them to produce the same level of detail as the exaced worker they just canned. And the cycle continues.

I have found it can help to 1) focus on applying to small local businesses that are imho less likely to post fake openings and 2) work with a recruiter. My current and previous job are both jobs with local businesses, and the previous one was found through a recruiter. I applied to a LOT of jobs before getting each of those. \n\nIf times are tight and you just need a little bit of money to tide you over, jobs in the restaurant industry and retail are in my experience way less likely to be fake than corporate jobs.

It's unfortunately, not just you. It's the market. I also think that the types of jobs that you are applying for and the industries may be in a bit a lull at the moment. \n\nA few comments on what you've mentioned below:\n\n*\"Is there something I am missing? I've tried fixing and perfecting my resume, attaching recommendation letters, doing certifications in hopes of boosting my application / status. I'm willing to try anything at this point to make sure I am able to make a living wage.\"*\n\n1. I recommend continuously updating your resume and trying and target it as closely as you can to the jobs you are applying for. If you've applied for over 400 jobs and you're not getting many interviews you may be missing some keywords in your resume that are not resonating with AI or ATS.\n\n2. Attaching recommendation letters at this point wont really help you if your resume isn't able to first make it past recruiters and hiring managers. Recruiters take about 6 seconds to review a resume and if they don't like what they see, they won't read anything else (cover letters, recommendation letters etc.).\n\n3. Certifications - same thought as above. A few questions here: Would it help to get a certification as a paralegal? Are the positions that you are applying for asking for specific certifications? Are you attaching the certifications that are relevant to the specific role you are applying for or attaching everything that you have to all of the postings?\n\n4. \"Willing to try everything\" - you have the non-profit experience. Have you considered volunteering at an organization to gain some experience and keep your resume fresh? I can appreciate that this isn't paid work, and of course isn't ideal or the end goal here. However, this may be an opportunity for you may be able to gain some connections and this could possibly open to the door to some opportunities for you. I think at this stage, building relationships even if there is no job in sight right away, can be a ++ in your situation. \n\nFinally, a suggestion: I think you may have to create two types of resumes: one for the legal/admin field and the other for data analytics. At first glance reading what you wrote, as a recruiter I would have some questions about the type of positions you'd be a fit for. However, I am not sure if this the case as I've not seen your resume. Gut feeling though is telling me that your resume may need a bit more focus.\n\nQuestion for you and maybe something to think about :): Do you want to go into the legal field or data? Keep us posted on how you do please and good luck.\n\n## Comment ID l215uwc with +1 score by [(Smashingly_Awesome, Reddit, 2024-05-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l215uwc/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nI think Ai can do all the paralegal work now.

Ex: One PR resume, one social media resume, one PR and social media resume, so on and so forth.\n* Making sure most bullets on my resume are quantifying my work. You won’t look as legit without numbers.\n* Having down pact my elevator pitch for the famous “tell me about yourself” question.\n* Applying to mostly jobs in my area. I found out of state roles came with more rejections. No one wants to cover relocation expenses anymore and don’t want to hear that you will pay for them yourself.\n* This is optional but I kept a spreadsheet of every single interview I did with the job title, salary, location, etc., to see where I stand and what jobs I am getting the most traction with. This informed what roles I applied to the most. It showed a nice pattern.\n* For interviews, I had my big accomplishments ready. These were things not on my resume as they are more specific.

Also, a “strategy” role sounds more like a consultant role, which again, I would do as the leader of the whole company and wouldn’t rely on someone junior or an expensive outside consultant to do. As for analyst, there’s probably plenty of those roles, but analyst needs to mean analytics in this regard- writing code, an Excel pro, or some very specific industry expertise that allows you to be more than a generalist analyst.\n\nDefinitely need to shoot for bigger orgs for those titles. Being in from the ground up with those skills means you need to know someone, like a family member, or take an internship title, which means lower pay for the experience and hope to work well enough and the startup to have enough budget to want you full-time within a matter of months. And for that, LinkedIn is as good as any platform to find those roles.\n\n## Comment ID jpjk6z1 with +3 score by [(grantmagdanz, Reddit, 2023-06-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/14ix4xi/where_to_find_startup_jobs/jpjk6z1/) (in reply to ID 14ix4xi):\nCheck out VC websites.

You could target a more specific and related role like product management, sales ops, or project management.   The need for these roles begin in smaller companies when they have about 5 developers or 5 sales people and become more important as the company gets larger teams that require more coordination.   Otherwise if you want to be a business analyst, you need a pretty big company and it’s probably going to be financially related position.   Companies that have raised money are more likely to invest in these roles before a self-funded company.  And there are lots of lists of companies who have raised money at local and national levels.\n\n## Comment ID jpjqper with +2 score by [(mischief_mangled, Reddit, 2023-06-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/14ix4xi/where_to_find_startup_jobs/jpjqper/) (in reply to ID 14ix4xi):\nAs someone who joined a seed stage that then raised a series A, I think the relative maturity of needs is ops/generalist, then bizops, then strategy. Strategy is kind of useless/a luxury in the early days (I say this as an ex consultant). Bizops can't work unless you have the data hygiene, pipeline, tools in place. Every business that is selling and onboarding and keeping customers happy has ops/needs generalist people who can do random shit.

Toxic culture lead by toxic higher ups. 4 layoffs (maybe 5 now with a new one January 2024 that I saw...) and each time there was zero sympathy or explanation. Instead, each layoff added pressure to current employees who then had to triple their work load for no additional pay. One time I heard the CEO tell people in the office that they should get back to work, when they were talking about an INTERNAL committee they were on and tasked with. The office is a graveyard with a requirement to come in even though 90% of the desks are empty and one half of the office doesn't even have the lights on anymore. I hate office days because it is eerily quiet and the days are depressing. CEO and VPs are the definition of toxic. They are always on expensive vacations abroad while everyone else is worked to the bone, and the \"unlimited PTO/ half day Fridays\" are a joke. I never get to take a half day on a Friday because of the added work load, and hands get slapped if you take a day off even if it is for mental health. \n\nDEI is nonexistent.\n\nI do not see the culture or anything about the company improving because the same VPs and higher ups are always safe, who are truly causing the issues. They should be embarrassed but their egos are too big to ever feel that way. \n\nAlso base pay is a joke compared to any other company.",

I was also “quiet hired” to take on additional responsibilities without a raise or promotion. It was very discouraging to discover that Built In is engaged in the very practices it publicly preaches against. \n\nThe work-life balance was terrible. I worked until 10 or 11 most nights and most weekends, too. This was common on my team. We had to keep up with unreasonable KPIs while leaders resisted our attempts to improve processes. \n\nMany of the perks are mostly performative. If you want to use a wellness day to recover from burnout, you have to scramble twice as hard to get set up for your absence. Half-day Fridays are cool in theory, except the majority of my team worked Friday afternoons anyway to keep up with unreasonable workloads. Unlimited PTO apparently does have limits, a colleague was once told that they shouldn’t take more than ~13 days, and it is possible to get written up for “excessive PTO.” \n\nSo the company loves to dangle these perks as differentiators when they lack meaning in practice.\n\nThere have been four layoffs since October 2022. Two public RIFs, a quiet restructuring, and a more recent silent layoff where remaining employees only found out through LinkedIn posts from their impacted colleagues. Despite the writing on the wall, the leadership remains toxically positive, bordering on delusion. At all-hands meetings, the CEO espouses a hustle mentality, insinuating that the grind and a positive attitude will pay off for everyone (except those who were laid off, obviously) and that the company is winning. I’ll never forget when – a few days after the second RIF – the company kicked off the next all-hands with upbeat pop music and the CEO telling the remaining staff to stay off LinkedIn because it was too depressing.\n\nI’m sure there will be a careful response to this review, as there is on all of the others. So I'll proactively say, in regards to pay transparency that would have addressed my pay disparity, the company said \"they were working on it\" for 2 years and eventually rolled out a disappointing, opaque process. And ultimately, they can’t say anything to change my experience – but I’m one of the few who got off easy. Many others are afraid to post their honest accounts of working at Built In out of concern for the NDA signed in exchange for severance during the many layoffs. \n\nMy advice to jobseekers considering a job here? Do NOT buy into the gospel or sacrifice yourself. Negotiate the heck out of your job offer and always remember: you are disposable.",

We have seen great success in hiring folks from the staffing world as they deeply understand our buyer persona and our industry as a whole! That said, Built In has always been committed to hiring top talent, and prioritizes both diversity of thought and experience - especially for roles that manage people.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to build long lasting teams with inspired leaders, and we are proud to share that our employees have an overall average tenure of 3.1 years, with Management at an average tenure of 4.4 Years. Specifically on our Account Management team the average employee tenure is 3.4 years, with a management tenure of 4.9 years. This is well above the industry average, which is something we are incredibly proud of.\r\n\r\nRegarding our Revenue infrastructure, we endeavor to set our teams up for optimal success, and recognize there are always areas for improvement. While we absolutely make mistakes, we make what we believe to be the best decisions based on the information we had at that time. Most importantly, those decisions and changes are always well-intentioned with the Account Manager and customer as the priority. However, what worked years ago, does not always continue to be the best approach. The past 12 months forced us to move swiftly related to territories/books, commission structure and we’re proud of the changes we’ve made in the positive direction the past 6 months to allow for a more equitable and predictable environment.\r\n\r\nThanks again for sharing your thoughts.

Last year we introduced an annual Inclusion Survey, dedicated to gathering employee feedback that would shape our annual DEI roadmap. We had over 60% of our employees participate in the survey, and we presented the results during a company-wide meeting including highlighting both our areas of strengths and areas of opportunity. While we are proud of our gender diversity (&gt;50% of our employees identify as women), we recognize we still have work to do to increase our intersectional representation across the business and have initiatives in place within our roadmap to accomplish this goal. \r\n\r\nRegarding our Leadership team, we care deeply about career development at Built In and are grateful that 3 of our 12 (25%) leaders have begun their careers with us as individual contributors and over their tenure have grown into VPs. That said, 75% of our leadership team have 10-15+ years of external experience across Growth, Enterprise, and Fortune 500 companies. \r\n\r\nCommitment to transparent communications is one of the top priorities of our leadership team, which is why we conduct a monthly company-wide meeting to ensure our employees are looped in to our top strategic initiatives and happenings across the business. We encourage employees to submit questions for our Q&amp;A portion of that meeting to ensure they have answers to any outstanding questions and are informed on the topics that are important to them. In addition, we have invested in training for all managers focused on feedback and coaching - it is our expectation that feedback is continuous and based on observable behaviors. We’ll continue to work on driving transparency across all levels of the business and appreciate you taking the time to flag this opportunity for improvement to us.",

In particular, Built In's regular practice of bribing people who are leaving to sign a non-disparagement agreement in order to get severance pay should stop you—a person reading Glassdoor reviews—in your tracks. I refused to sign, even though they offered me a month's salary to do so, which is why I am legally able to leave this review. Think about all the people who got laid off (1/4 of their workforce in fall 2022 alone) who needed that money and decided to sign. You're not hearing from them here, which radically juices the company's ratings as an employer. Core values are not taken seriously by leadership. I regularly tried to lead with solutions by \"poking holes and offering ideas to patch them up,\" as they like to say, and was told to put my head down and keep these thoughts to myself. Even easy-to-implement fixes that everyone could agree on were regularly sidelined due politics or personalities. People who don't take the hint here are asked to resign or laid off at the first opportunity. Content leaders don't believe in the expertise of content creators and do not want them to \"do more.\" Despite being told when I was hired that they were looking for someone who would bring new ideas, strategies and processes to the team, they really wanted a cog in a machine who would shovel content through the mill, not someone interested in raising—or even maintaining—quality or standards. DEI at Built In is all talk and no action. As a hiring manager, I struggled to diversify our very homogeneous team, but the candidate pool was very white and male in every one of the 9 or so hires I was directly involved in. I asked HR for help in expanding this pool and they refused, telling me I needed to come up with my own strategies to expand the applicant pool because they were too busy to offer support. Several candidates of color made it to the final round, only to be denied by leaders or HR for not passing the personality test they make candidates take or not having the right disposition, look or \"culture fit.\" In fact, it was an open secret (on my team, at least) that HR is pretty much useless after you're onboarded. Every time I reached out with a \"people team\" issue, HR would take days or weeks to even respond. I repeatedly had to follow up on my own emails just to get a response! The eventual reply was usually to cut and paste sections of the handbook (that I'd obviously already read) or send URLs to outside advice articles (that they'd already asked managers to read). Then they would schedule follow-up meetings with me to see what I had done to fix the issue on my own, filling up my already stuffed calendar with garbage check-ins to clear themselves of accountability. I've literally never had to deal with a less valuable HR group in my nearly two decades in the professional workforce. I witnessed first-hand multiple occasions of the content studio team being undermined or stabbed in the back by petty managers and leaders on the news team and thrown under the bus by a leaderless sales team. I personally tried to create bonds between these teams to create some empathy between them, but eventually gave up in disgust.",

We are also pleased to hear that you feel you were able to achieve a healthy work-life balance during your time with us.  This is critically important to the leaders of our organization at every level. We were also glad to hear that you found value in the manager training options provided by the People Team, ranging from our Manager CORE training from LifeLabs to our introduction of Paradigm Reach, an on-demand DEI learning tool. \r\n \r\nWe do take exception to your comment that requesting a non-disparagement covenant as a condition of receiving severance pay is somehow inappropriate. Please know that it’s standard practice to include a severance pay offer in a standard separation agreement containing customary terms and conditions, including a non-disparagement covenant.  \r\nWe acknowledge your concern regarding our lack of diversity.  We recognize that we still have work to do and we are working on strategies to diversify the applicant pool so that we can continue our initiative to improve DEI at Built In.\r\n \r\nFinally, we are proud of our managers (especially the individual who managed you during your employment with us), who encourage a variety of opinions and discourse, as well as our HR team for being responsive to the questions and viewpoints of our team. We are disappointed to learn that you feel your ideas were not given appropriate attention. It’s important to us that everyone feels valued for the contributions they bring to work every day!\r\n \r\nWe would like the opportunity to further explore your concerns now that we are aware of them, and we encourage you to reach out any time to our People Team.

We are glad to hear that during your time at Built In you experienced the passion and drive of the leadership team, while also having fun! \r\n\r\nAlmost all companies, including Built In, have been impacted by the unpredictable market dynamics. This has caused us to take a close look at our own organization.  It is our responsibility to ensure that our company continues to stay strong. Like most companies, we re-forecasted and our Sales reps have a clear path to attainment. \r\n \r\nWith that goal in mind, we were faced with challenging decisions. In October, we made the difficult decision to implement a workforce reduction that impacted 23% of our employees. \r\n \r\nThis was an incredibly hard decision and one that we hoped we would never need to make.  When looking at the impact on the business as a result of this economic downturn, we needed to evaluate current staffing levels and bring them into alignment with the reality of our business needs. Our goal is to make the transition for affected employees as smooth as possible. To do that, every affected employee was offered severance pay, continuation coverage under our health insurance and Modern Health benefits through the end of November, and the ability to keep their company-issued laptop for their job search.",

Employee success, culture, wellness, and actual happiness are at the forefront of how Built In treats their employees regardless of the market. I can honestly say I ENJOY working each day, and so do those around me. Keeping a good attitude and drive during a rough market is hard to do and not for everyone, but I am surrounded by people who genuinely care which is so cool.

There is a mean girls, tribe mentality that forces out anyone with real experience. This results in a chaotic strategy and magical thinking. The CEO is convinced that the product is an enterprise offering, but it cannot support large companies. There is also a push to move internationally before the product provides value in US markets.\r\n\r\nExperienced leaders turn over quickly and then they are blamed for the failings of the company. It's a burnout factory where the CEO can't stand it if someone else's ideas are successful. Once you challenge, you are pushed out.\r\n\r\nThe senior sales team is comprised of some of inexperienced sales people who are friends with leadership. \r\n\r\nThe product is old technology and poorly integrated across sites. There is enough technical debt to cripple the platform, but it is never addressed because they are always pursuing shiny objects with no proof that there is market need for the solution.\r\n\r\nPoor planning, lack of strategy and, copycat mentality have resulted in four layoffs over the past 2 years. Even when they promise that it will be the last.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of talk about the company being people first and valuing diversity. It's lip service.\r\n\r\nIf you want to just show up and agree with the leadership, you'll do fine. If you want to get anything done or make an impact, look elsewhere.",

Since 2019 there have been at least, count ‘em, 5+ exec (VP and above, including C level ) positions that have left within ~1 year of their start date. Not even counting the numerous 'Director' level positions that have come and gone. Look into median (instead of average) tenure of leadership positions. -Siloed functions. Teams don't work together within their functions, nor do they collaborate across functions. What is product working on? No idea because a product roadmap is not communicated broadly. -Culture. Toxic, plain and simple. Watch out for the most tenured employees, especially in sales and up to the founder and cofounder. Either get in line or prepare to be ostracized. Leading with solutions is a value, but only if it jives with the CEO's agenda. Otherwise, speaking up will mark you for a PIP or for layoffs. -Career progression. Ask HR, there has been a plan for career laddering the last 3 years with no implementation. DE&amp;I is a facade and the team should spend more time focusing on improving culture, community, and investigating employee concerns rather than vanity metrics or responding to these reviews.",

Please know that we do read these, share with leadership, and work collaboratively to make appropriate improvements based on these insights.\r\n\r\nBuilt In has always operated with a people-first mindset, and we agree that there are great, hard working, caring employees who make Built In what it is.\r\n\r\nLike many others, Built In has been impacted by today’s market and the macro economics surrounding the industry. To those employees who were impacted by layoffs, we offered competitive packages, provided resume and interviewing coaching, and offered personal introductions to companies who are hiring. \r\n\r\nWe are doing our best to navigate this new normal and make decisions in the best interest of our people as well as the business.For example, we encourage all of our leaders to manage their teams independently, while cohesively operating under unified values and business practices. What works for one team may not work for another. Which is why we’ve introduced a Flex Work Policy for all of our employees. We offer both Flex Mode and Remote Mode, where you may have the opportunity to work remotely based on your role and function - or enjoy the perks of being in the office on a hybrid schedule. Some departments may choose to designate additional in-office days, but our philosophy is to encourage flexibility to support personal work styles while balancing business needs.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to our leadership, we are proud to have a leadership team with an average tenure of 7.75 years. When you have a group of individuals who work together for that long, it’s natural that friendships form and we’re proud of the deep trust this team has in each other. It allows us to move fast, be innovative, and have deep alignment with our strategic initiatives. The leaders who we’ve brought on board over the last 1-2 years came in for growth and those leaders are not always the type of leaders who can operate in market downturns.  We’re proud of the leaders we have in place and their commitment to supporting and empowering our people is unwavering. \r\n\r\nIf you have additional questions or other concerns you’d like us to address - please feel free to get in touch directly!",

Expect to be on 8-10 hours of meetings per week just doing “ice breakers” and being forced to share personal information with your work colleagues. And if you happen to want to go off camera, or ask for any form of work/life balance? You’re once again disciplined for “not fitting into the culture.” Built In’s cult-like atmosphere of harassment, toxic positivity and blatant hypocrisy (ie. ZERO people of color in any department I came in contact with, yet preaching about diversity) is the worst I’ve ever experienced.",

We only wish you would have done so while you were employed with us, as we would have appreciated the opportunity to address these issues directly with you.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to be an organization built and led by women. Individuals who identify as women account for 58% of our employee population, 55% of all managers and 53% of our leadership team. \r\n\r\nWe conducted our first annual anonymous DEI survey in Q4 of 2021 and across the board, women rated our company more favorably than their peers. For example, participants who identified as women gave the following ratings:\r\n- 96% favorability for “I feel respected at Built In,” \r\n- 91% favorability for “I feel like I belong at Built In,”\r\n- 87% favorability for “At Built In there is open and honest two-way communication” \r\n- 81% favorable for “I can voice a contrary opinion without fear of negative consequences” \r\nWe’re disappointed that you don’t feel you had a similar experience while you were employed with us.\r\n\r\nWe take the safety and wellbeing of our employees very seriously. We conduct annual harassment prevention training for all employees and recently invested in a platform that is trauma-informed, trigger free, and provides the most marginalized individuals with additional resources. \r\n\r\nWe have a longstanding written anti-harassment policy that provides multiple reporting avenues.  Again, we wish you had utilized our policy and brought your concerns to our attention during your employment with us, as we would have followed our outlined protocol by asking you to provide the facts underlying your concerns and promptly investigating those concerns. \r\n\r\nWe would like the opportunity to investigate your concerns now that you have made us aware of them, so we encourage you to reach out directly to any member of our People Team so that we can obtain the additional information we need in order to do so.  Thank you again.\r\n\r\nWe’re surprised to hear your comment about a lack of diversity. While we recognize that we have work to do and we are committed to fulfilling the commitments of our annual DEI roadmap, we can confirm that every department in our company has diverse representation.",

We are in an economic climate that demands constant change of organizations, and our leadership team is dedicated to the success of our people as we emerge stronger than ever before. We continue to invest in developing as people-leaders, as the success of any organization is deeply rooted in the satisfaction and well-being of its employees. \n\nWe take pride in our offerings, and we are disappointed to hear that you found them subpar. We are constantly working to enhance our products and services, and have invested heavily in these by bringing in a Chief Technology Officer and doubling down on R&amp;D to get us to a spot to go international in the near future. We are pleased to say that our products will continue to be enhanced in our pursuit of delivering top results to our tech visitors and customers. \n\nIf you are open to it, we would appreciate the opportunity to discuss your concerns in more detail and gather additional insights that can help us address specific issues. You can reach out directly to our CEO or to our Head of People at any time.  We take all feedback seriously, and your insights are invaluable as we continuously strive to improve our organization.",

And if you happen to want to go off camera, or ask for any form of work/life balance?

In particular, Built In's regular practice of bribing people who are leaving to sign a non-disparagement agreement in order to get severance pay should stop you—a person reading Glassdoor reviews—in your tracks. I refused to sign, even though they offered me a month's salary to do so, which is why I am legally able to leave this review. Think about all the people who got laid off (1/4 of their workforce in fall 2022 alone) who needed that money and decided to sign. You're not hearing from them here, which radically juices the company's ratings as an employer. Core values are not taken seriously by leadership. I regularly tried to lead with solutions by \"poking holes and offering ideas to patch them up,\" as they like to say, and was told to put my head down and keep these thoughts to myself. Even easy-to-implement fixes that everyone could agree on were regularly sidelined due politics or personalities. People who don't take the hint here are asked to resign or laid off at the first opportunity. Content leaders don't believe in the expertise of content creators and do not want them to \"do more.\" Despite being told when I was hired that they were looking for someone who would bring new ideas, strategies and processes to the team, they really wanted a cog in a machine who would shovel content through the mill, not someone interested in raising—or even maintaining—quality or standards. DEI at Built In is all talk and no action. As a hiring manager, I struggled to diversify our very homogeneous team, but the candidate pool was very white and male in every one of the 9 or so hires I was directly involved in. I asked HR for help in expanding this pool and they refused, telling me I needed to come up with my own strategies to expand the applicant pool because they were too busy to offer support. Several candidates of color made it to the final round, only to be denied by leaders or HR for not passing the personality test they make candidates take or not having the right disposition, look or \"culture fit.\" In fact, it was an open secret (on my team, at least) that HR is pretty much useless after you're onboarded. Every time I reached out with a \"people team\" issue, HR would take days or weeks to even respond. I repeatedly had to follow up on my own emails just to get a response! The eventual reply was usually to cut and paste sections of the handbook (that I'd obviously already read) or send URLs to outside advice articles (that they'd already asked managers to read). Then they would schedule follow-up meetings with me to see what I had done to fix the issue on my own, filling up my already stuffed calendar with garbage check-ins to clear themselves of accountability. I've literally never had to deal with a less valuable HR group in my nearly two decades in the professional workforce. I witnessed first-hand multiple occasions of the content studio team being undermined or stabbed in the back by petty managers and leaders on the news team and thrown under the bus by a leaderless sales team. I personally tried to create bonds between these teams to create some empathy between them, but eventually gave up in disgust.",

Since 2019 there have been at least, count ‘em, 5+ exec (VP and above, including C level ) positions that have left within ~1 year of their start date. Not even counting the numerous 'Director' level positions that have come and gone. Look into median (instead of average) tenure of leadership positions. -Siloed functions. Teams don't work together within their functions, nor do they collaborate across functions. What is product working on? No idea because a product roadmap is not communicated broadly. -Culture. Toxic, plain and simple. Watch out for the most tenured employees, especially in sales and up to the founder and cofounder. Either get in line or prepare to be ostracized. Leading with solutions is a value, but only if it jives with the CEO's agenda. Otherwise, speaking up will mark you for a PIP or for layoffs. -Career progression. Ask HR, there has been a plan for career laddering the last 3 years with no implementation. DE&amp;I is a facade and the team should spend more time focusing on improving culture, community, and investigating employee concerns rather than vanity metrics or responding to these reviews.",

Employee success, culture, wellness, and actual happiness are at the forefront of how Built In treats their employees regardless of the market. I can honestly say I ENJOY working each day, and so do those around me. Keeping a good attitude and drive during a rough market is hard to do and not for everyone, but I am surrounded by people who genuinely care which is so cool. I am excited to keep pushing through together and see what we can do next as a team!",

        "cons": "While working here as a senior team member, I discovered I was paid less than new hires in junior roles, despite consistently being recognized as a top performer. I was also “quiet hired” to take on additional responsibilities without a raise or promotion. It was very discouraging to discover that Built In is engaged in the very practices it publicly preaches against. \n\nThe work-life balance was terrible. I worked until 10 or 11 most nights and most weekends, too. This was common on my team. We had to keep up with unreasonable KPIs while leaders resisted our attempts to improve processes. \n\nMany of the perks are mostly performative. If you want to use a wellness day to recover from burnout, you have to scramble twice as hard to get set up for your absence. Half-day Fridays are cool in theory, except the majority of my team worked Friday afternoons anyway to keep up with unreasonable workloads. Unlimited PTO apparently does have limits, a colleague was once told that they shouldn’t take more than ~13 days, and it is possible to get written up for “excessive PTO.” \n\nSo the company loves to dangle these perks as differentiators when they lack meaning in practice.\n\nThere have been four layoffs since October 2022. Two public RIFs, a quiet restructuring, and a more recent silent layoff where remaining employees only found out through LinkedIn posts from their impacted colleagues. Despite the writing on the wall, the leadership remains toxically positive, bordering on delusion. At all-hands meetings, the CEO espouses a hustle mentality, insinuating that the grind and a positive attitude will pay off for everyone (except those who were laid off, obviously) and that the company is winning. I’ll never forget when – a few days after the second RIF – the company kicked off the next all-hands with upbeat pop music and the CEO telling the remaining staff to stay off LinkedIn because it was too depressing.\n\nI’m sure there will be a careful response to this review, as there is on all of the others. So I'll proactively say, in regards to pay transparency that would have addressed my pay disparity, the company said \"they were working on it\" for 2 years and eventually rolled out a disappointing, opaque process. And ultimately, they can’t say anything to change my experience – but I’m one of the few who got off easy. Many others are afraid to post their honest accounts of working at Built In out of concern for the NDA signed in exchange for severance during the many layoffs. \n\nMy advice to jobseekers considering a job here? Do NOT buy into the gospel or sacrifice yourself. Negotiate the heck out of your job offer and always remember: you are disposable.",

Instead, each layoff added pressure to current employees who then had to triple their work load for no additional pay. One time I heard the CEO tell people in the office that they should get back to work, when they were talking about an INTERNAL committee they were on and tasked with. The office is a graveyard with a requirement to come in even though 90% of the desks are empty and one half of the office doesn't even have the lights on anymore. I hate office days because it is eerily quiet and the days are depressing. CEO and VPs are the definition of toxic. They are always on expensive vacations abroad while everyone else is worked to the bone, and the \"unlimited PTO/ half day Fridays\" are a joke. I never get to take a half day on a Friday because of the added work load, and hands get slapped if you take a day off even if it is for mental health. \n\nDEI is nonexistent.\n\nI do not see the culture or anything about the company improving because the same VPs and higher ups are always safe, who are truly causing the issues. They should be embarrassed but their egos are too big to ever feel that way. \n\nAlso base pay is a joke compared to any other company.",

There is also a push to move internationally before the product provides value in US markets.\r\n\r\nExperienced leaders turn over quickly and then they are blamed for the failings of the company. It's a burnout factory where the CEO can't stand it if someone else's ideas are successful. Once you challenge, you are pushed out.\r\n\r\nThe senior sales team is comprised of some of inexperienced sales people who are friends with leadership. \r\n\r\nThe product is old technology and poorly integrated across sites. There is enough technical debt to cripple the platform, but it is never addressed because they are always pursuing shiny objects with no proof that there is market need for the solution.\r\n\r\nPoor planning, lack of strategy and, copycat mentality have resulted in four layoffs over the past 2 years.

      "# [14 Dangers of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by Mike Thomas on 2023-02-08](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/risks-of-artificial-intelligence)\nAs AI grows more sophisticated and widespread, the voices warning against the potential dangers of artificial intelligence grow louder.\n\n“These things could get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over, and we need to worry now about how we prevent that happening,” said Geoffrey Hinton, known as the “Godfather of AI” for his foundational work on machine learning and neural network algorithms. In 2023, Hinton left his position at Google so that he could “talk about the dangers of AI,” noting a part of him even regrets his life’s work.\n\nThe renowned computer scientist isn’t alone in his concerns.\n\nTesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, along with over 1,000 other tech leaders, urged in a 2023 open letter to put a pause on large AI experiments, citing that the technology can “pose profound risks to society and humanity.”\n\nWhether it’s the increasing automation of certain jobs, gender and racially biased algorithms or autonomous weapons that operate without human oversight (to name just a few), unease abounds on a number of fronts. And we’re still in the very early stages of what AI is really capable of.\n\n14 Dangers of AI\n\nQuestions about who’s developing AI and for what purposes make it all the more essential to understand its potential downsides. Below we take a closer look at the possible dangers of artificial intelligence and explore how to manage its risks.\n\n1. Lack of AI Transparency and Explainability\n\nAI and deep learning models can be difficult to understand, even for those who work directly with the technology. This leads to a lack of transparency for how and why AI comes to its conclusions, creating a lack of explanation for what data AI algorithms use, or why they may make biased or unsafe decisions. These concerns have given rise to the use of explainable AI, but there’s still a long way before transparent AI systems become common practice.\n\nTo make matters worse, AI companies continue to remain tight-lipped about their products. Former employees of OpenAI and Google DeepMind have accused both companies of concealing the potential dangers of their AI tools. This secrecy leaves the general public unaware of possible threats and makes it difficult for lawmakers to take proactive measures ensuring AI is developed responsibly.\n\n2. Job Losses Due to AI Automation\n\nAI-powered job automation is a pressing concern as the technology is adopted in industries like marketing, manufacturing and healthcare. By 2030, tasks that account for up to 30 percent of hours currently being worked in the U.S. economy could be automated — with Black and Hispanic employees left especially vulnerable to the change — according to McKinsey. Goldman Sachs even states 300 million full-time jobs could be lost to AI automation.\n\n“The reason we have a low unemployment rate, which doesn’t actually capture people that aren’t looking for work, is largely that lower-wage service sector jobs have been pretty robustly created by this economy,” futurist Martin Ford told Built In. With AI on the rise, though, “I don’t think that’s going to continue.”\n\nAs AI robots become smarter and more dexterous, the same tasks will require fewer humans. And while AI is estimated to create 97 million new jobs by 2025, many employees won’t have the skills needed for these technical roles and could get left behind if companies don’t upskill their workforces.\n\n“If you’re flipping burgers at McDonald’s and more automation comes in, is one of these new jobs going to be a good match for you?” Ford said. “Or is it likely that the new job requires lots of education or training or maybe even intrinsic talents — really strong interpersonal skills or creativity — that you might not have? Because those are the things that, at least so far, computers are not very good at.”\n\nAs technology strategist Chris Messina has pointed out, fields like law and accounting are primed for an AI takeover as well. In fact, Messina said, some of them may well be decimated. AI already is having a significant impact on medicine. Law and accounting are next, Messina said, the former being poised for “a massive shakeup.”\n\n“It’s a lot of attorneys reading through a lot of information — hundreds or thousands of pages of data and documents. It’s really easy to miss things,” Messina said. “So AI that has the ability to comb through and comprehensively deliver the best possible contract for the outcome you’re trying to achieve is probably going to replace a lot of corporate attorneys.”\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceAI Copywriting: Why Writing Jobs Are Safe\n\n3. Social Manipulation Through AI Algorithms\n\nSocial manipulation also stands as a danger of artificial intelligence. This fear has become a reality as politicians rely on platforms to promote their viewpoints, with one example being Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., wielding a TikTok troll army to capture the votes of younger Filipinos during the Philippines’ 2022 election.\n\nTikTok, which is just one example of a social media platform that relies on AI algorithms, fills a user’s feed with content related to previous media they’ve viewed on the platform. Criticism of the app targets this process and the algorithm’s failure to filter out harmful and inaccurate content, raising concerns over TikTok’s ability to protect its users from misleading information.\n\nOnline media and news have become even murkier in light of AI-generated images and videos, AI voice changers as well as deepfakes infiltrating political and social spheres. These technologies make it easy to create realistic photos, videos, audio clips or replace the image of one figure with another in an existing picture or video. As a result, bad actors have another avenue for sharing misinformation and war propaganda, creating a nightmare scenario where it can be nearly impossible to distinguish between credible and faulty news.\n\n“No one knows what’s real and what’s not,” Ford said. “You literally cannot believe your own eyes and ears; you can’t rely on what, historically, we’ve considered to be the best possible evidence ... That’s going to be a huge issue.”\n\n4. Social Surveillance With AI Technology\n\nIn addition to its more existential threat, Ford is focused on the way AI will adversely affect privacy and security. A prime example is China’s use of facial recognition technology in offices, schools and other venues. Besides tracking a person’s movements, the Chinese government may be able to gather enough data to monitor a person’s activities, relationships and political views.\n\nAnother example is U.S. police departments embracing predictive policing algorithms to anticipate where crimes will occur. The problem is that these algorithms are influenced by arrest rates, which disproportionately impact Black communities. Police departments then double down on these communities, leading to over-policing and questions over whether self-proclaimed democracies can resist turning AI into an authoritarian weapon.\n\n“Authoritarian regimes use or are going to use it,” Ford said. “The question is, ‘How much does it invade Western countries, democracies, and what constraints do we put on it?’”\n\nRelatedAre Police Robots the Future of Law Enforcement?\n\n5. Lack of Data Privacy Using AI Tools\n\nA 2024 AvePoint survey found that the top concern among companies is data privacy and security. And businesses may have good reason to be hesitant, considering the large amounts of data concentrated in AI tools and the lack of regulation regarding this information.\n\nAI systems often collect personal data to customize user experiences or to help train the AI models you’re using (especially if the AI tool is free). Data may not even be considered secure from other users when given to an AI system, as one bug incident that occurred with ChatGPT in 2023 “allowed some users to see titles from another active user’s chat history.” While there are laws present to protect personal information in some cases in the United States, there is no explicit federal law that protects citizens from data privacy harm caused by AI.\n\nRelated ReadingAI-Generated Content and Copyright Law: What We Know\n\n6. Biases Due to AI\n\nVarious forms of AI bias are detrimental too. Speaking to the New York Times, Princeton computer science professor Olga Russakovsky said AI bias goes well beyond gender and race. In addition to data and algorithmic bias (the latter of which can “amplify” the former), AI is developed by humans — and humans are inherently biased.\n\n“A.I. researchers are primarily people who are male, who come from certain racial demographics, who grew up in high socioeconomic areas, primarily people without disabilities,” Russakovsky said. “We’re a fairly homogeneous population, so it’s a challenge to think broadly about world issues.”\n\nThe narrow views of individuals have culminated in an AI industry that leaves out a range of perspectives. According to UNESCO, only 100 of the world’s 7,000 natural languages have been used to train top chatbots. It doesn’t help that 90 percent of online higher education materials are already produced by European Union and North American countries, further restricting AI’s training data to mostly Western sources.\n\nThe limited experiences of AI creators may explain why speech-recognition AI often fails to understand certain dialects and accents, or why companies fail to consider the consequences of a chatbot impersonating historical figures. If businesses and legislators don’t exercise greater care to avoid recreating powerful prejudices, AI biases could spread beyond corporate contexts and exacerbate societal issues like housing discrimination.\n\n7. Socioeconomic Inequality as a Result of AI\n\nIf companies refuse to acknowledge the inherent biases baked into AI algorithms, they may compromise their DEI initiatives through AI-powered recruiting. The idea that AI can measure the traits of a candidate through facial and voice analyses is still tainted by racial biases, reproducing the same discriminatory hiring practices businesses claim to be eliminating.\n\nWidening socioeconomic inequality sparked by AI-driven job loss is another cause for concern, revealing the class biases of how AI is applied. Workers who perform more manual, repetitive tasks have experienced wage declines as high as 70 percent because of automation, with office and desk workers remaining largely untouched in AI’s early stages. However, the increase in generative AI use is already affecting office jobs, making for a wide range of roles that may be more vulnerable to wage or job loss than others.\n\n8. Weakening Ethics and Goodwill Because of AI\n\nAlong with technologists, journalists and political figures, even religious leaders are sounding the alarm on AI’s potential pitfalls. In a 2023 Vatican meeting and in his message for the 2024 World Day of Peace, Pope Francis called for nations to create and adopt a binding international treaty that regulates the development and use of AI.\n\nPope Francis warned against AI’s ability to be misused, and “create statements that at first glance appear plausible but are unfounded or betray biases.” He stressed how this could bolster campaigns of disinformation, distrust in communications media, interference in elections and more — ultimately increasing the risk of “fueling conflicts and hindering peace.”\n\nThe rapid rise of generative AI tools gives these concerns more substance. Many users have applied the technology to get out of writing assignments, threatening academic integrity and creativity. Plus, biased AI could be used to determine whether an individual is suitable for a job, mortgage, social assistance or political asylum, producing possible injustices and discrimination, noted Pope Francis.\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceWhat Are AI Ethics?\n\n9. Autonomous Weapons Powered By AI\n\nAs is too often the case, technological advancements have been harnessed for warfare. When it comes to AI, some are keen to do something about it before it’s too late: In a 2016 open letter, over 30,000 individuals, including AI and robotics researchers, pushed back against the investment in AI-fueled autonomous weapons.\n\n“The key question for humanity today is whether to start a global AI arms race or to prevent it from starting,” they wrote. “If any major military power pushes ahead with AI weapon development, a global arms race is virtually inevitable, and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious: autonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow.”\n\nThis prediction has come to fruition in the form of Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems, which locate and destroy targets on their own while abiding by few regulations. Because of the proliferation of potent and complex weapons, some of the world’s most powerful nations have given in to anxieties and contributed to a tech cold war.\n\nMany of these new weapons pose major risks to civilians on the ground, but the danger becomes amplified when autonomous weapons fall into the wrong hands. Hackers have mastered various types of cyber attacks, so it’s not hard to imagine a malicious actor infiltrating autonomous weapons and instigating absolute armageddon.\n\nIf political rivalries and warmongering tendencies are not kept in check, artificial intelligence could end up being applied with the worst intentions. Some fear that, no matter how many powerful figures point out the dangers of artificial intelligence, we’re going to keep pushing the envelope with it if there’s money to be made.\n\n“The mentality is, ‘If we can do it, we should try it; let’s see what happens,” Messina said. “‘And if we can make money off it, we’ll do a whole bunch of it.’ But that’s not unique to technology. That’s been happening forever.’”\n\n10. Financial Crises Brought About By AI Algorithms\n\nThe financial industry has become more receptive to AI technology’s involvement in everyday finance and trading processes. As a result, algorithmic trading could be responsible for our next major financial crisis in the markets.\n\nWhile AI algorithms aren’t clouded by human judgment or emotions, they also don’t take into account contexts, the interconnectedness of markets and factors like human trust and fear. These algorithms then make thousands of trades at a blistering pace with the goal of selling a few seconds later for small profits. Selling off thousands of trades could scare investors into doing the same thing, leading to sudden crashes and extreme market volatility.\n\nInstances like the 2010 Flash Crash and the Knight Capital Flash Crash serve as reminders of what could happen when trade-happy algorithms go berserk, regardless of whether rapid and massive trading is intentional.\n\nThis isn’t to say that AI has nothing to offer to the finance world. In fact, AI algorithms can help investors make smarter and more informed decisions on the market. But finance organizations need to make sure they understand their AI algorithms and how those algorithms make decisions. Companies should consider whether AI raises or lowers their confidence before introducing the technology to avoid stoking fears among investors and creating financial chaos.\n\n11. Loss of Human Influence\n\nAn overreliance on AI technology could result in the loss of human influence — and a lack in human functioning — in some parts of society. Using AI in healthcare could result in reduced human empathy and reasoning, for instance. And applying generative AI for creative endeavors could diminish human creativity and emotional expression. Interacting with AI systems too much could even cause reduced peer communication and social skills. So while AI can be very helpful for automating daily tasks, some question if it might hold back overall human intelligence, abilities and need for community.\n\n12. Uncontrollable Self-Aware AI\n\nThere also comes a worry that AI will progress in intelligence so rapidly that it will become sentient, and act beyond humans’ control — possibly in a malicious manner. Alleged reports of this sentience have already been occurring, with one popular account being from a former Google engineer who stated the AI chatbot LaMDA was sentient and speaking to him just as a person would. As AI’s next big milestones involve making systems with artificial general intelligence, and eventually artificial superintelligence, cries to completely stop these developments continue to rise.\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceWhat Is the Eliza Effect?\n\n13. Increased Criminal Activity\n\nAs AI technology has become more accessible, the number of people using it for criminal activity has risen. Online predators can now generate images of children, making it difficult for law enforcement to determine actual cases of child abuse. And even in cases where children aren’t physically harmed, the use of children’s faces in AI-generated images presents new challenges for protecting children’s online privacy and digital safety.\n\nVoice cloning has also become an issue, with criminals leveraging AI-generated voices to impersonate other people and commit phone scams. These examples merely scratch the surface of AI’s capabilities, so it will only become harder for local and national government agencies to adjust and keep the public informed of the latest AI-driven threats.\n\n14. Broader Economic and Political Instability\n\nOverinvesting in a specific material or sector can put economies in a precarious position. Like steel, AI could run the risk of drawing so much attention and financial resources that governments fail to develop other technologies and industries. Plus, overproducing AI technology could result in dumping the excess materials, which could potentially fall into the hands of hackers and other malicious actors.\n\nHow to Mitigate the Risks of AI\n\nAI still has numerous benefits, like organizing health data and powering self-driving cars. To get the most out of this promising technology, though, some argue that plenty of regulation is necessary.\n\n“There’s a serious danger that we’ll get [AI systems] smarter than us fairly soon and that these things might get bad motives and take control,” Hinton told NPR. “This isn’t just a science fiction problem. This is a serious problem that’s probably going to arrive fairly soon, and politicians need to be thinking about what to do about it now.”\n\nDevelop Legal Regulations\n\nAI regulation has been a main focus for dozens of countries, and now the U.S. and European Union are creating more clear-cut measures to manage the rising sophistication of artificial intelligence. In fact, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) published the AI Bill of Rights in 2022, a document outlining to help responsibly guide AI use and development. Additionally, President Joe Biden issued an executive order in 2023 requiring federal agencies to develop new rules and guidelines for AI safety and security.\n\nAlthough legal regulations mean certain AI technologies could eventually be banned, it doesn’t prevent societies from exploring the field.\n\nFord argues that AI is essential for countries looking to innovate and keep up with the rest of the world.\n\n“You regulate the way AI is used, but you don’t hold back progress in basic technology. I think that would be wrong-headed and potentially dangerous,” Ford said. “We decide where we want AI and where we don’t; where it’s acceptable and where it’s not. And different countries are going to make different choices.”\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceWill This Election Year Be a Turning Point for AI Regulation?\n\nEstablish Organizational AI Standards and Discussions\n\nOn a company level, there are many steps businesses can take when integrating AI into their operations. Organizations can develop processes for monitoring algorithms, compiling high-quality data and explaining the findings of AI algorithms. Leaders could even make AI a part of their company culture and routine business discussions, establishing standards to determine acceptable AI technologies.\n\nGuide Tech With Humanities Perspectives\n\nThough when it comes to society as a whole, there should be a greater push for tech to embrace the diverse perspectives of the humanities. Stanford University AI researchers Fei-Fei Li and John Etchemendy make this argument in a 2019 blog post that calls for national and global leadership in regulating artificial intelligence:\n\n“The creators of AI must seek the insights, experiences and concerns of people across ethnicities, genders, cultures and socio-economic groups, as well as those from other fields, such as economics, law, medicine, philosophy, history, sociology, communications, human-computer-interaction, psychology, and Science and Technology Studies (STS).”\n\nBalancing high-tech innovation with human-centered thinking is an ideal method for producing responsible AI technology and ensuring the future of AI remains hopeful for the next generation. The dangers of artificial intelligence should always be a topic of discussion, so leaders can figure out ways to wield the technology for noble purposes.\n\n“I think we can talk about all these risks, and they’re very real,” Ford said. “But AI is also going to be the most important tool in our toolbox for solving the biggest challenges we face.”\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

      "# [The Future of AI: How AI Is Changing the World by Mike Thomas on 2022-08-10](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-future)\nInnovations in the field of artificial intelligence continue to shape the future of humanity across nearly every industry. AI is already the main driver of emerging technologies like big data, robotics and IoT, and generative AI has further expanded the possibilities and popularity of AI.\n\nAccording to a 2023 IBM survey, 42 percent of enterprise-scale businesses integrated AI into their operations, and 40 percent are considering AI for their organizations. In addition, 38 percent of organizations have implemented generative AI into their workflows while 42 percent are considering doing so.\n\nWith so many changes coming at such a rapid pace, here’s what shifts in AI could mean for various industries and society at large.\n\nMore on the Future of AICan AI Make Art More Human?\n\nThe Evolution of AI\n\nAI has come a long way since 1951, when the first documented success of an AI computer program was written by Christopher Strachey, whose checkers program completed a whole game on the Ferranti Mark I computer at the University of Manchester. Thanks to developments in machine learning and deep learning, IBM’s Deep Blue defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, and the company’s IBM Watson won Jeopardy! in 2011.\n\nSince then, generative AI has spearheaded the latest chapter in AI’s evolution, with OpenAI releasing its first GPT models in 2018. This has culminated in OpenAI developing its GPT-4 model and ChatGPT, leading to a proliferation of AI generators that can process queries to produce relevant text, audio, images and other types of content.\n\nAI has also been used to help sequence RNA for vaccines and model human speech, technologies that rely on model- and algorithm-based machine learning and increasingly focus on perception, reasoning and generalization.\n\nHow AI Will Impact the Future\n\nImproved Business Automation\n\nAbout 55 percent of organizations have adopted AI to varying degrees, suggesting increased automation for many businesses in the near future. With the rise of chatbots and digital assistants, companies can rely on AI to handle simple conversations with customers and answer basic queries from employees.\n\nAI’s ability to analyze massive amounts of data and convert its findings into convenient visual formats can also accelerate the decision-making process. Company leaders don’t have to spend time parsing through the data themselves, instead using instant insights to make informed decisions.\n\n“If [developers] understand what the technology is capable of and they understand the domain very well, they start to make connections and say, ‘Maybe this is an AI problem, maybe that’s an AI problem,’” said Mike Mendelson, a learner experience designer for NVIDIA. “That’s more often the case than, ‘I have a specific problem I want to solve.’”\n\nMore on AI75 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Companies to Know\n\nJob Disruption\n\nBusiness automation has naturally led to fears over job losses. In fact, employees believe almost one-third of their tasks could be performed by AI. Although AI has made gains in the workplace, it’s had an unequal impact on different industries and professions. For example, manual jobs like secretaries are at risk of being automated, but the demand for other jobs like machine learning specialists and information security analysts has risen.\n\nWorkers in more skilled or creative positions are more likely to have their jobs augmented by AI, rather than be replaced. Whether forcing employees to learn new tools or taking over their roles, AI is set to spur upskilling efforts at both the individual and company level.\n\n“One of the absolute prerequisites for AI to be successful in many [areas] is that we invest tremendously in education to retrain people for new jobs,” said Klara Nahrstedt, a computer science professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and director of the school’s Coordinated Science Laboratory.\n\nData Privacy Issues\n\nCompanies require large volumes of data to train the models that power generative AI tools, and this process has come under intense scrutiny. Concerns over companies collecting consumers’ personal data have led the FTC to open an investigation into whether OpenAI has negatively impacted consumers through its data collection methods after the company potentially violated European data protection laws.\n\nIn response, the Biden-Harris administration developed an AI Bill of Rights that lists data privacy as one of its core principles. Although this legislation doesn’t carry much legal weight, it reflects the growing push to prioritize data privacy and compel AI companies to be more transparent and cautious about how they compile training data.\n\nIncreased Regulation\n\nAI could shift the perspective on certain legal questions, depending on how generative AI lawsuits unfold in 2024. For example, the issue of intellectual property has come to the forefront in light of copyright lawsuits filed against OpenAI by writers, musicians and companies like The New York Times. These lawsuits affect how the U.S. legal system interprets what is private and public property, and a loss could spell major setbacks for OpenAI and its competitors.\n\nEthical issues that have surfaced in connection to generative AI have placed more pressure on the U.S. government to take a stronger stance. The Biden-Harris administration has maintained its moderate position with its latest executive order, creating rough guidelines around data privacy, civil liberties, responsible AI and other aspects of AI. However, the government could lean toward stricter regulations, depending on changes in the political climate.\n\nClimate Change Concerns\n\nOn a far grander scale, AI is poised to have a major effect on sustainability, climate change and environmental issues. Optimists can view AI as a way to make supply chains more efficient, carrying out predictive maintenance and other procedures to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nAt the same time, AI could be seen as a key culprit in climate change. The energy and resources required to create and maintain AI models could raise carbon emissions by as much as 80 percent, dealing a devastating blow to any sustainability efforts within tech. Even if AI is applied to climate-conscious technology, the costs of building and training models could leave society in a worse environmental situation than before.\n\nAccelerated Speed of Innovation\n\nIn an essay about the future potential of AI, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei hypothesizes that powerful AI technology could speed up research in the biological sciences as much as tenfold, bringing about a phenomenon he coins “the compressed 21st century,” in which 50 to 100 years of innovation might happen in the span of five to 10 years. This theory builds on the idea that truly revolutionary discoveries are made at a rate of maybe once per year, with the core limitation being a shortage of talented researchers. By increasing the cognitive power devoted to developing hypotheses and testing them out, Amodei suggests, we might close the time gap between important discoveries like the 25-year delay between CRISPR’s discovery in the ‘80s and its application to gene editing.\n\nWhat Industries Will AI Impact the Most?\n\nThere’s virtually no major industry that modern AI hasn’t already affected. Here are a few of the industries undergoing the greatest changes as a result of AI.\n\nAI in Manufacturing\n\nManufacturing has been benefiting from AI for years. With AI-enabled robotic arms and other manufacturing bots dating back to the 1960s and 1970s, the industry has adapted well to the powers of AI. These industrial robots typically work alongside humans to perform a limited range of tasks like assembly and stacking, and predictive analysis sensors keep equipment running smoothly.\n\nAI in Healthcare\n\nIt may seem unlikely, but AI healthcare is already changing the way humans interact with medical providers. Thanks to its big data analysis capabilities, AI helps identify diseases more quickly and accurately, speed up and streamline drug discovery and even monitor patients through virtual nursing assistants.\n\nAI in Finance\n\nBanks, insurers and financial institutions leverage AI for a range of applications like detecting fraud, conducting audits and evaluating customers for loans. Traders have also used machine learning’s ability to assess millions of data points at once, so they can quickly gauge risk and make smart investing decisions.\n\nAI in Education\n\nAI in education will change the way humans of all ages learn. AI’s use of machine learning, natural language processing and facial recognition help digitize textbooks, detect plagiarism and gauge the emotions of students to help determine who’s struggling or bored. Both presently and in the future, AI tailors the experience of learning to student’s individual needs.\n\nAI in Media\n\nJournalism is harnessing AI too, and will continue to benefit from it. One example can be seen in The Associated Press’ use of Automated Insights, which produces thousands of earning reports stories per year. But as generative AI writing tools, such as ChatGPT, enter the market, questions about their use in journalism abound.\n\nAI in Customer Service\n\nMost people dread getting a robocall, but AI in customer service can provide the industry with data-driven tools that bring meaningful insights to both the customer and the provider. AI tools powering the customer service industry come in the form of chatbots and virtual assistants.\n\nAI in Transportation\n\nTransportation is one industry that is certainly teed up to be drastically changed by AI. Self-driving cars and AI travel planners are just a couple of facets of how we get from point A to point B that will be influenced by AI. Even though autonomous vehicles are far from perfect, they will one day ferry us from place to place.\n\nRisks and Dangers of AI\n\nDespite reshaping numerous industries in positive ways, AI still has flaws that leave room for concern. Here are a few potential risks of artificial intelligence.\n\nJob Losses\n\nBetween 2023 and 2028, 44 percent of workers’ skills will be disrupted. Not all workers will be affected equally — women are more likely than men to be exposed to AI in their jobs. Combine this with the fact that there is a gaping AI skills gap between men and women, and women seem much more susceptible to losing their jobs. If companies don’t have steps in place to upskill their workforces, the proliferation of AI could result in higher unemployment and decreased opportunities for those of marginalized backgrounds to break into tech.\n\nHuman Biases\n\nThe reputation of AI has been tainted with a habit of reflecting the biases of the people who train the algorithmic models. For example, facial recognition technology has been known to favor lighter-skinned individuals, discriminating against people of color with darker complexions. If researchers aren’t careful in rooting out these biases early on, AI tools could reinforce these biases in the minds of users and perpetuate social inequalities.\n\nDeepfakes and Misinformation\n\nThe spread of deepfakes threatens to blur the lines between fiction and reality, leading the general public to question what’s real and what isn’t. And if people are unable to identify deepfakes, the impact of misinformation could be dangerous to individuals and entire countries alike. Deepfakes have been used to promote political propaganda, commit financial fraud and place students in compromising positions, among other use cases.\n\nData Privacy\n\nTraining AI models on public data increases the chances of data security breaches that could expose consumers’ personal information. Companies contribute to these risks by adding their own data as well. A 2024 Cisco survey found that 48 percent of businesses have entered non-public company information into generative AI tools and 69 percent are worried these tools could damage their intellectual property and legal rights. A single breach could expose the information of millions of consumers and leave organizations vulnerable as a result.\n\nAutomated Weapons\n\nThe use of AI in automated weapons poses a major threat to countries and their general populations. While automated weapons systems are already deadly, they also fail to discriminate between soldiers and civilians. Letting artificial intelligence fall into the wrong hands could lead to irresponsible use and the deployment of weapons that put larger groups of people at risk.\n\nSuperior Intelligence\n\nNightmare scenarios depict what’s known as the technological singularity, where superintelligent machines take over and permanently alter human existence through enslavement or eradication. Even if AI systems never reach this level, they can become more complex to the point where it’s difficult to determine how AI makes decisions at times. This can lead to a lack of transparency around how to fix algorithms when mistakes or unintended behaviors occur.\n\n“I don’t think the methods we use currently in these areas will lead to machines that decide to kill us,” said Marc Gyongyosi, founder of Onetrack.AI. “I think that maybe five or 10 years from now, I’ll have to reevaluate that statement because we’ll have different methods available and different ways to go about these things.”\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

      "# [What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? by Ellen Glover on 2024-10-21](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence)\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to build machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI enables machines to simulate human abilities, such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making and comprehension. Common applications of AI include speech recognition, image recognition, content generation, recommendation systems and self-driving cars.\n\nWhile AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, advancements in machine learning and deep learning in particular are changing virtually every industry, making AI an increasingly integral part of everyday life.\n\nWhat Is Artificial Intelligence?\n\nArtificial intelligence refers to computer systems that are capable of performing tasks traditionally associated with human intelligence — such as making predictions, identifying objects, interpreting speech and generating natural language. AI systems learn how to do so by processing massive amounts of data and looking for patterns to model in their own decision-making. In many cases, humans will supervise an AI’s learning process, reinforcing good decisions and discouraging bad ones, but some AI systems are designed to learn without supervision.\n\nOver time, AI systems improve on their performance of specific tasks, allowing them to adapt to new inputs and make decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. In essence, artificial intelligence is about teaching machines to think and learn like humans, with the goal of automating work and solving problems more efficiently.\n\nHow Does AI Work?\n\nArtificial intelligence systems work by using algorithms and data. First, a massive amount of data is collected and applied to mathematical models, or algorithms, which use the information to recognize patterns and make predictions in a process known as training. Once algorithms have been trained, they are deployed within various applications, where they continuously learn from and adapt to new data. This allows AI systems to perform complex tasks like image recognition, language processing and data analysis with greater accuracy and efficiency over time.\n\nMachine Learning\n\nThe primary approach to building AI systems is through machine learning (ML), where computers learn from large datasets by identifying patterns and relationships within the data. A machine learning algorithm uses statistical techniques to help it “learn” how to get progressively better at a task, without necessarily having been programmed for that certain task. It uses historical data as input to predict new output values. Machine learning consists of both supervised learning (where the expected output for the input is known thanks to labeled data sets) and unsupervised learning (where the expected outputs are unknown due to the use of unlabeled data sets).\n\nNeural Networks\n\nMachine learning is typically done using neural networks, a series of algorithms that process data by mimicking the structure of the human brain. These networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or “neurons,” that process information and pass it between each other. By adjusting the strength of connections between these neurons, the network can learn to recognize complex patterns within data, make predictions based on new inputs and even learn from mistakes. This makes neural networks useful for recognizing images, understanding human speech and translating words between languages.\n\nDeep Learning\n\nDeep learning is an important subset of machine learning. It uses a type of artificial neural network known as deep neural networks, which contain a number of hidden layers through which data is processed, allowing a machine to go “deep” in its learning and recognize increasingly complex patterns, making connections and weighting input for the best results. Deep learning is particularly effective at tasks like image and speech recognition and natural language processing, making it a crucial component in the development and advancement of AI systems.\n\nNatural Language Processing\n\nNatural language processing (NLP) involves teaching computers to understand and produce written and spoken language in a similar manner as humans. NLP combines computer science, linguistics, machine learning and deep learning concepts to help computers analyze unstructured text or voice data and extract relevant information from it. NLP mainly tackles speech recognition and natural language generation, and it’s leveraged for use cases like spam detection and virtual assistants.\n\nComputer Vision\n\nComputer vision is another prevalent application of machine learning techniques, where machines process raw images, videos and visual media, and extract useful insights from them. Deep learning and convolutional neural networks are used to break down images into pixels and tag them accordingly, which helps computers discern the difference between visual shapes and patterns. Computer vision is used for image recognition, image classification and object detection, and completes tasks like facial recognition and detection in self-driving cars and robots.\n\nWhy Is Artificial Intelligence Important?\n\nArtificial intelligence aims to provide machines with similar processing and analysis capabilities as humans, making AI a useful counterpart to people in everyday life. AI is able to interpret and sort data at scale, solve complicated problems and automate various tasks simultaneously, which can save time and fill in operational gaps missed by humans.\n\nAI serves as the foundation for computer learning and is used in almost every industry — from healthcare and finance to manufacturing and education — helping to make data-driven decisions and carry out repetitive or computationally intensive tasks.\n\nMany existing technologies use artificial intelligence to enhance capabilities. We see it in smartphones with AI assistants, e-commerce platforms with recommendation systems and vehicles with autonomous driving abilities. AI also helps protect people by piloting fraud detection systems online and robots for dangerous jobs, as well as leading research in healthcare and climate initiatives.\n\nTypes of Artificial Intelligence\n\nArtificial intelligence can be classified in several different ways.\n\nStrong AI vs. Weak AI\n\nAI can be organized into two broad categories: weak AI and strong AI.\n\nWeak AI (or narrow AI) refers to AI that automates specific tasks. It typically outperforms humans, but it operates within a limited context and is applied to a narrowly defined problem. For now, all AI systems are examples of weak AI, ranging from email inbox spam filters to recommendation engines to chatbots.\n\nStrong AI, often referred to as artificial general intelligence (AGI), is a hypothetical benchmark at which AI could possess human-like intelligence and adaptability, solving problems it’s never been trained to work on. AGI does not actually exist yet, and it is unclear whether it ever will.\n\nThe 4 Kinds of AI\n\nAI can then be further categorized into four main types: reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind and self-awareness.\n\nReactive machines perceive the world in front of them and react. They can carry out specific commands and requests, but they cannot store memory or rely on past experiences to inform their decision making in real time. This makes reactive machines useful for completing a limited number of specialized duties. Examples include Netflix’s recommendation engine and IBM’s Deep Blue (used to play chess).\n\nLimited memory AI has the ability to store previous data and predictions when gathering information and making decisions. Essentially, it looks into the past for clues to predict what may come next. Limited memory AI is created when a team continuously trains a model in how to analyze and utilize new data, or an AI environment is built so models can be automatically trained and renewed. Examples include ChatGPT and self-driving cars.\n\nTheory of mind is a type of AI that does not actually exist yet, but it describes the idea of an AI system that can perceive and understand human emotions, and then use that information to predict future actions and make decisions on its own.\n\nSelf-aware AI refers to artificial intelligence that has self-awareness, or a sense of self. This type of AI does not currently exist. In theory, though, self-aware AI possesses human-like consciousness and understands its own existence in the world, as well as the emotional state of others.\n\nBenefits of AI\n\nAI is beneficial for automating repetitive tasks, solving complex problems, reducing human error and much more.\n\nAutomating Repetitive Tasks\n\nRepetitive tasks such as data entry and factory work, as well as customer service conversations, can all be automated using AI technology. This lets humans focus on other priorities.\n\nSolving Complex Problems\n\nAI’s ability to process large amounts of data at once allows it to quickly find patterns and solve complex problems that may be too difficult for humans, such as predicting financial outlooks or optimizing energy solutions.\n\nImproving Customer Experience\n\nAI can be applied through user personalization, chatbots and automated self-service technologies, making the customer experience more seamless and increasing customer retention for businesses.\n\nAdvancing Healthcare and Medicine\n\nAI works to advance healthcare by accelerating medical diagnoses, drug discovery and development and medical robot implementation throughout hospitals and care centers.\n\nReducing Human Error\n\nThe ability to quickly identify relationships in data makes AI effective for catching mistakes or anomalies among mounds of digital information, overall reducing human error and ensuring accuracy.\n\nDisadvantages of AI\n\nWhile artificial intelligence has its benefits, the technology also comes with risks and potential dangers to consider.\n\nJob Displacement\n\nAI’s abilities to automate processes, generate rapid content and work for long periods of time can mean job displacement for human workers.\n\nBias and Discrimination\n\nAI models may be trained on data that reflects biased human decisions, leading to outputs that are biased or discriminatory against certain demographics.\n\nHallucinations\n\nAI systems may inadvertently “hallucinate” or produce inaccurate outputs when trained on insufficient or biased data, leading to the generation of false information.\n\nPrivacy Concerns\n\nThe data collected and stored by AI systems may be done so without user consent or knowledge, and may even be accessed by unauthorized individuals in the case of a data breach.\n\nLack of Explainability\n\nAI systems may be developed in a manner that isn’t transparent or inclusive, resulting in a lack of explanation for potentially harmful AI decisions as well as a negative impact on users and businesses.\n\nEnvironmental Costs\n\nLarge-scale AI systems can require a substantial amount of energy to operate and process data, which increases carbon emissions and water consumption.\n\nArtificial Intelligence Applications\n\nArtificial intelligence has applications across multiple industries, ultimately helping to streamline processes and boost business efficiency.\n\nHealthcare\n\nAI is used in healthcare to improve the accuracy of medical diagnoses, facilitate drug research and development, manage sensitive healthcare data and automate online patient experiences. It is also a driving factor behind medical robots, which work to provide assisted therapy or guide surgeons during surgical procedures.\n\nRetail\n\nAI in retail amplifies the customer experience by powering user personalization, product recommendations, shopping assistants and facial recognition for payments. For retailers and suppliers, AI helps automate retail marketing, identify counterfeit products on marketplaces, manage product inventories and pull online data to identify product trends.\n\nCustomer Service\n\nIn the customer service industry, AI enables faster and more personalized support. AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can handle routine customer inquiries, provide product recommendations and troubleshoot common issues in real-time. And through NLP, AI systems can understand and respond to customer inquiries in a more human-like way, improving overall satisfaction and reducing response times.\n\nManufacturing\n\nAI in manufacturing can reduce assembly errors and production times while increasing worker safety. Factory floors may be monitored by AI systems to help identify incidents, track quality control and predict potential equipment failure. AI also drives factory and warehouse robots, which can automate manufacturing workflows and handle dangerous tasks.\n\nFinance\n\nThe finance industry utilizes AI to detect fraud in banking activities, assess financial credit standings, predict financial risk for businesses plus manage stock and bond trading based on market patterns. AI is also implemented across fintech and banking apps, working to personalize banking and provide 24/7 customer service support.\n\nMarketing\n\nIn the marketing industry, AI plays a crucial role in enhancing customer engagement and driving more targeted advertising campaigns. Advanced data analytics allows marketers to gain deeper insights into customer behavior, preferences and trends, while AI content generators help them create more personalized content and recommendations at scale. AI can also be used to automate repetitive tasks such as email marketing and social media management.\n\nGaming\n\nVideo game developers apply AI to make gaming experiences more immersive. Non-playable characters (NPCs) in video games use AI to respond accordingly to player interactions and the surrounding environment, creating game scenarios that can be more realistic, enjoyable and unique to each player.\n\nMilitary\n\nAI assists militaries on and off the battlefield, whether it’s to help process military intelligence data faster, detect cyberwarfare attacks or automate military weaponry, defense systems and vehicles. Drones and robots in particular may be imbued with AI, making them applicable for autonomous combat or search and rescue operations.\n\nArtificial Intelligence Examples\n\nSpecific examples of AI include:\n\nGenerative AI Tools\n\nGenerative AI tools, sometimes referred to as AI chatbots — including ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and Grok — use artificial intelligence to produce written content in a range of formats, from essays to code and answers to simple questions.\n\nSmart Assistants\n\nPersonal AI assistants, like Alexa and Siri, use natural language processing to receive instructions from users to perform a variety of “smart tasks.” They can carry out commands like setting reminders, searching for online information or turning off your kitchen lights.\n\nSelf-Driving Cars\n\nSelf-driving cars are a recognizable example of deep learning, since they use deep neural networks to detect objects around them, determine their distance from other cars, identify traffic signals and much more.\n\nWearables\n\nMany wearable sensors and devices used in the healthcare industry apply deep learning to assess the health condition of patients, including their blood sugar levels, blood pressure and heart rate. They can also derive patterns from a patient’s prior medical data and use that to anticipate any future health conditions.\n\nVisual Filters\n\nFilters used on social media platforms like TikTok and Snapchat rely on algorithms to distinguish between an image’s subject and the background, track facial movements and adjust the image on the screen based on what the user is doing.\n\nThe Rise of Generative AI\n\nGenerative AI describes artificial intelligence systems that can create new content — such as text, images, video or audio — based on a given user prompt. To work, a generative AI model is fed massive data sets and trained to identify patterns within them, then subsequently generates outputs that resemble this training data.\n\nGenerative AI has gained massive popularity in the past few years, especially with chatbots and image generators arriving on the scene. These kinds of tools are often used to create written copy, code, digital art and object designs, and they are leveraged in industries like marketing, entertainment, consumer goods and manufacturing.\n\nGenerative AI comes with challenges though. For instance, it can be used to create fake content and deepfakes, which could spread disinformation and erode social trust. And some AI-generated material could potentially infringe on people’s copyright and intellectual property rights.\n\nAI Regulation\n\nAs AI grows more complex and powerful, lawmakers around the world are seeking to regulate its use and development.\n\nThe first major step to regulate AI occurred in 2024 in the European Union with the passing of its sweeping Artificial Intelligence Act, which aims to ensure that AI systems deployed there are “safe, transparent, traceable, non-discriminatory and environmentally friendly.” Countries like China and Brazil have also taken steps to govern artificial intelligence.\n\nMeanwhile, AI regulation in the United States is still a work in progress. The Biden-Harris administration introduced a non-enforceable AI Bill of Rights in 2022, and then The Executive Order on Safe, Secure and Trustworthy AI in 2023, which aims to regulate the AI industry while maintaining the country’s status as a leader in the industry. Congress has made several attempts to establish more robust legislation, but it has largely failed, leaving no laws in place that specifically limit the use of AI or regulate its risks. For now, all AI legislation in the United States exists only on the state level.\n\nFuture of Artificial Intelligence\n\nThe future of artificial intelligence holds immense promise, with the potential to revolutionize industries, enhance human capabilities and solve complex challenges. It can be used to develop new drugs, optimize global supply chains and power advanced robots — transforming the way we live and work.\n\nLooking ahead, one of the next big steps for artificial intelligence is to progress beyond weak or narrow AI and achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI). With AGI, machines will be able to think, learn and act the same way as humans do, blurring the line between organic and machine intelligence. This could pave the way for increased automation and problem-solving capabilities in medicine, manufacturing, transportation and more — as well as sentient AI down the line. In a 2024 essay about the promises of the technology, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei speculates that powerful AI might accelerate innovation in the biological sciences as much as tenfold by enabling a larger number of experiments to be conducted at any given time, and by shortening the gap between new discoveries and subsequent research building on those discoveries.\n\nOn the other hand, the increasing sophistication of AI also raises concerns about heightened job loss, widespread disinformation and loss of privacy. And questions persist about the potential for AI to outpace human understanding and intelligence — a phenomenon known as technological singularity that could lead to unforeseeable risks and possible moral dilemmas.\n\nFor now, society is largely looking toward federal and business-level AI regulations to help guide the technology’s future.\n\nHistory of AI\n\nArtificial intelligence as a concept began to take off in the 1950s when computer scientist Alan Turing released the 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” which questioned if machines could think and how one would test a machine’s intelligence. This paper set the stage for AI research and development, and was the first proposal of the Turing test, a method used to assess machine intelligence. The term “artificial intelligence” was coined in 1956 by computer scientists John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester and Claude E. Shannon at a Dartmouth College academic conference.\n\nFollowing the Dartmouth College conference and throughout the 1970s, interest in AI research grew from academic institutions and U.S. government funding. Innovations in computing allowed several AI foundations to be established during this time, including machine learning, neural networks and natural language processing.\n\nDespite its advances, AI technologies eventually became more difficult to scale than expected and declined in interest and funding, resulting in the first AI winter until the 1980s.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, AI interest reawakened as computers became more powerful, deep learning became popularized and AI-powered “expert systems” were introduced. However, due to the complication of new systems and an inability of existing technologies to keep up, the second AI winter occurred and lasted until the mid-1990s.\n\nBy the mid-2000s, innovations in processing power, big data and advanced deep learning techniques resolved AI’s previous roadblocks, allowing further AI breakthroughs. Modern AI technologies like virtual assistants, driverless cars and generative AI began entering the mainstream in the 2010s, making AI what it is today.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",
      "# [What Does Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Mean in the Workplace? by Kate Heinz on 2023-02-08](https://builtin.com/diversity-inclusion/what-does-dei-mean-in-the-workplace)\nDiversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) refers to practices and policies intended to support people who come from varying backgrounds and give them the resources they need to thrive in the workplace. DEI frameworks take into account factors like race, gender and sexual orientation, so teams can find ways to help employees from marginalized groups succeed.\n\nWhat Is Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)?\n\nDEI (sometimes referred to DE&I or IE&D) stands for diversity, equity and inclusion. As a discipline, DEI is any policy or set of initiatives designed to make people of various backgrounds feel welcome and ensure they have support to perform to the fullest of their abilities in the workplace.\n\n“We as employers need to make sure we’re including these individuals and that we’re giving them equity,” said Catalina Colman, former director of HR and inclusion at Built In. “We need to make sure that, not only do they have a job, but they have the same ability to get promoted, to contribute and have the same impact — in the world and in the workplace — as their peers.”\n\nThis kind of environment is created by following all three aspects of DEI:\n\nDiversity\n\nDiversity is the presence of differences within a given setting. In the workplace, that can mean differences in race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age and socioeconomic class. It can also refer to differences in physical ability, veteran status, whether or not you have kids — all of those are components of diversity.\n\nWhy Diversity Matters\n\nDiversity in the workplace is important because with different backgrounds come different points of view, which ultimately leads to better ideas and solutions.\n\n“From a business standpoint, different perspectives directly influence a product — how it’s made, who it serves, how it functions and so on,” Colman said. “More perspectives make for a better product.” People from different backgrounds with varying life experiences will be able to provide new perspectives that help refine and enhance processes.\n\n“The more diverse voices there are in your organization, the better your outcomes will be, purely from a business standpoint,” Colman said.\n\nEven so, Colman urges employers to look beyond the business case: “I believe that if we give people the equitable opportunity to not only be employed, but to have employment with purpose and passion, our society can and will do great things. It’s a measurable good for everyone.”\n\nEquity\n\nEquity is the process of ensuring that practices and programs are impartial, fair and provide equal possible outcomes for every individual.\n\nWhy Equity Matters\n\nIn order to ensure equal circumstances for all individuals across the organization, equity requires that employers recognize barriers and advantages. This is the crucial difference between “equity” and “equality.”\n\n“Equity takes into account the fact that not everybody is starting at the same level,” explained Colman. “Take home ownership, for example. A bank can make the statement that the loan application process is equal and that they will not discriminate based on race, gender or ethnicity. That doesn’t take into account student loans, familial debt, socioeconomic status.”\n\nThese limitations are what define barriers and give rise to advantages, ultimately leading to an inequitable process. Inequity permeates every aspect of your business, requiring vigilance and swift action. “You’re not going to be able to build diversity if you’re not taking the steps to be more equitable,” Colman said.\n\nCompanies that establish equitable environments not only support diverse workforces, but also incentivize employees to invest more energy and passion into their positions. “Equity is why we go to work,” explained Colman. “We want to get compensated fairly for our work, we want to be challenged, to learn and to contribute. People often choose an employer based on those things, which boil down to equity.”\n\nInclusion\n\nInclusion is the practice of ensuring that people feel a sense of belonging in the workplace. This means that every employee feels comfortable and supported by the organization when it comes to being their authentic selves.\n\nWhy Inclusion Matters\n\nWhile the workplace does require professionalism and etiquette, an inclusive culture should not bar individuals from being themselves.\n\n“Employees should not worry about code-switching or shielding part of their identity,” Colman said. “They should be able to walk through the door without feeling like something about them has to change.”\n\nInclusion is what maintains diversity. Without it, employees will simply leave the organization. “If a candidate walks into a workplace and they’re the only woman or BIPOC employee, they’re going to question the employer’s authenticity and values,” Colman said.\n\n“People want to belong, plain and simple,” she added. “And marginalized individuals want to know that they’re not going to be the token person to represent a demographic. They shouldn’t have to worry about that in the workplace; they should be focused on how they’re going to have an impact within the company.”\n\nWhy DEI Is Important: Benefits of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nDEI is vital to creating and maintaining a successful workplace, one founded on the principle that all people can thrive personally and professionally. Bringing together people of various backgrounds leads to new and creative ideas. More importantly, a DEI strategy contributes to a space where all employees feel they have intrinsic worth, not in spite of their differences but because of their differences.\n\nBelow are a few more benefits businesses can enjoy upon embracing a DEI approach.\n\n1. Strengthened Recruitment\n\nDEI has grown in popularity among candidates and employees. In fact, three-fourths of job seekers and employees treat DEI as a major factor when weighing job offers and companies. Candidates recognize the positive effects of an environment that welcomes a range of backgrounds and want to join this kind of space.\n\nHowever, employees aren’t the only ones who should be pushing for more diverse and inclusive cultures. Company leaders must also make the effort to implement DEI policies, and there are plenty of incentives for businesses to get started as soon as possible.\n\n2. Higher Employee Retention\n\nOnce candidates join an organization, DEI can also play a role in convincing them to stick around. Feelings of inclusion make up as much as 35 percent of an employee’s emotional connection to their work and 20 percent of their wanting to remain with their current employer. Companies that take steps to cultivate a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace can then reduce employee turnover and enjoy a more stable workforce through the years.\n\n3. More Innovation\n\nA Harvard Business Review survey of 79 large companies found that a 0.1-point increase in a company’s DEI ratings correlates to a 13-percent increase in that company’s ability to change. When companies construct inclusive teams, employees from diverse backgrounds can offer different ideas and perspectives. This makes it easier to solve problems, develop unorthodox approaches and craft creative solutions to help companies adapt on the fly.\n\n4. Deeper Trust\n\nTrust hinges on leadership building genuine relationships with employees, and DEI is a key component of this process. When companies make DEI commitments and don’t follow through, 40 percent of workers would think about leaving and 56 percent would no longer recommend their employer as a place to work.\n\nOrganizations that recruit diverse talent must execute DEI initiatives to make employees of different backgrounds feel respected and safe in the workplace. If businesses neglect their DEI commitments, employees of marginalized backgrounds may believe the company doesn’t care about them and lose the trust they once had in organizational leadership.\n\n5. Improved Business Outcomes\n\nCompanies that listen to DEI advocates’ demands and make changes can benefit from a diverse and inclusive culture as well.\n\nAccording to Forbes, increasing female partners’ shares by 10 percent often leads to a 10 percent rise in revenue. In addition, firms that display culturally and ethnically diverse executive teams are 33 percent more likely to lead their industries in profitability. When people feel welcomed for who they are, they perform at a higher level. It’s a win-win situation for everyone when companies take steps to diversify their workforces.\n\nIf your industry is ever going to be a place where innovation and ingenuity thrive, diversity, equity and inclusion have to take center stage. Employers must actively work to create meaningful change in spite of the history of injustice that has marginalized underrepresented groups within the workplace. This work is often spearheaded by HR departments.\n\nMore on DEIWhat Is Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB)?\n\nHR’s Role in Implementing a DEI Strategy and Culture\n\nFor employers and people management professionals alike, the biggest challenge is knowing where to start.\n\n“There’s no quick fix,” Colman said. “A lot of people immediately jump to figure out how they can make their company more diverse, but you can’t underestimate the importance of inclusion and equity. Without those two pieces, you’re not going to achieve true diversity.”\n\nUnderstanding how each element of DEI builds upon the others is important to creating a work environment that is equitable and inclusive of all individuals. Just like DEI is a multifaceted process, Colman encourages employers to lean on each other.\n\n“It’s not going to be a single HR person that addresses the issue of DEI for a company,” she added. “Lean on your professional community. You’re not going to be able to have all the answers because you don’t have all the perspectives.”\n\nThe focus on DEI has prompted a huge shift for HR. “I think the mindset has always been to avoid talking about these things,” Colman said. “We typically put them in the handbook and address them in training maybe once a year. We didn’t want to make people uncomfortable. I think right now, the call to action is about understanding how to navigate that discomfort and how to use that to elevate your workforce. It’s about doing the important work that is long overdue and becoming inclusive and equitable.”\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",
      "# [The True Costs of Employee Turnover by Kate Heinz on 2022-01-12](https://builtin.com/recruiting/cost-of-turnover)\nHigh employee turnover can have a big impact on your organization’s bottom line. But more than that, it’s a sign that your company is not empowering your team to show up to work each day. Tackling high turnover should be about more than just saving money — it should also be about helping your company reach its full potential. That all comes down to building trust and rapport with your employees.\n\nRead on to learn the true cost of employee turnover — and how to reduce it.\n\nWhat Is Employee Turnover?\n\nEmployee turnover is the percentage of employees that leave a company over a given period of time. It’s closely related to employee retention rate, though the two are not always the inverse of each other. Turnover may be a part of business, but high turnover is largely indicative of deeper issues.\n\nTurnover is split into two categories: voluntary and involuntary. Voluntary turnover refers to an employee’s decision to leave the organization, whereas involuntary turnover occurs when an employee is terminated by the employer. Ideally, you’re only hiring people you want to keep around, so involuntary turnover is kept to a minimum. Voluntary turnover, on the other hand, is more difficult to control and has unforeseen consequences that can be harmful to a business.\n\nThe True Cost of Employee Turnover\n\nThe costs of turnover are extremely high: it’s estimated that losing an employee can cost a company one-half to two times the employee’s salary. Depending on the individual’s level of seniority, the financial burden fluctuates. For hourly workers, it costs an average of $1,500 per employee. For technical positions, the cost jumps to 100 to 150 percent of salary. At the high end, C-suite turnover can cost 213 percent of salary.\n\nNichole Viviani, chief people officer at Xplor Technologies, notes that some of the obvious costs of turnover include ad spending for newly open positions and the extra time commitment of training new employees – but that isn’t the whole picture.\n\n“There’s the less visible, but equally impactful, costs,” she said. “Things like missed or delayed revenue, or the risk of losing long-standing customers when customer-facing colleagues leave.”\n\nNot only are you forced to dedicate time and resources to recruiting, onboarding and training a new hire after an employee leaves; your business simultaneously takes a hit internally while the role remains unfilled. These expenses are known as the cost per hire and cost of vacancy, respectively. It’s estimated that two thirds of all sunk costs due to turnover are intangible, including lost productivity and knowledge, which are part of the cost-of-vacancy calculation.\n\n“It takes a while for new employees to ramp and fully onboard into a new role and a new company,” said Shirley Grill-Rachman, COO of Skai. “Turnover can have dual implications of opportunity cost, while that role is backfilled, [and] the cost of that ramp time for a replacement hire.”\n\nHowever, the most substantial impact of turnover is not a financial cost, but the damage done to your remaining team. Your people are absolutely essential to your business’s success. Without them, current employees need to take on additional responsibilities, and your company may have to abandon or postpone plans to scale. In short, a high turnover rate cuts much deeper than meets the eye, but these are some of the factors you should be aware of.\n\nLost Productivity\n\nWhen an employee leaves, their workload has to go somewhere. Either projects are halted altogether while the role remains vacant, or colleagues are forced to pick up the slack and spread themselves thin across multiple roles.\n\n“When talented and knowledgeable employees leave, you run the risk of missing targets and seeing a negative impact on customer service while a replacement is recruited and trained,” Viviani said.\n\nStalled projects lead to delayed releases and lost revenue, so a reduction in turnover can spell the difference between meeting your quarterly goals or missing them entirely.\n\nDepleted Employee Morale\n\nA team member’s departure can be a significant blow to employee morale, as losing a friend and colleague leaves a hole in the team dynamic. On top of that, employees may begin to look for problems; if someone they trust and respect decided to leave, should they consider it, too?\n\n“For some employees, [losing a teammate] leads to frustration, resentment and burnout, and can prompt them to question whether they, too, should be looking for a new opportunity,” said Viviani.\n\nDiminished Employer Brand\n\nThe reputation of being a revolving-door employer won’t attract job seekers. If anything, your open roles will draw in low-quality candidates — individuals who aren’t interested in a long-term position or who don’t care about making a significant impact. These employees can demotivate others and drive more new hires out the door shortly after they arrive.\n\nMore Turnover\n\nTurnover is cyclical. As mentioned above, an employee’s departure impacts the company culture and the workload of their teammates. Overworked, unengaged employees are more susceptible to burnout which generally leads to additional turnover. Regardless of industry and company, some turnover will always be par for the course, but preventing subsequent employee separations is crucial.\n\n“For better or worse, turnover tends to happen in waves,” said Grill-Rachman. “Obviously, when one of those waves hits, morale can be impacted as more employees reevaluate their individual relationships to their workplaces.”\n\nRelated38 Employee Turnover Statistics to Know\n\nHow to Calculate Employee Turnover Rate\n\nTo calculate employee turnover rate, you’ll need to know, within a given time period, the number of employee separations and the average number of employees present. The average number of employees can be determined by adding together the number of employees on the first day and the last day of the time period, then dividing that sum total by two.\n\nThen, plug the above values into the following turnover rate formula:\n\nTurnover rate = [(# of employee separations) / (average # of employees)] x 100\n\nFactors of High Employee Turnover\n\nIn order to evaluate the true cost of turnover at your company, you need to understand the aspects of your business that are likely contributing to your high rate of turnover. In extremely volatile times, the factors of turnover are exacerbated. Especially then, the following common causes of turnover cannot be overlooked.\n\nCompany Culture\n\nEmployees can recognize a toxic company culture from a mile away, and they won’t be loyal to an employer that neglects to make improvements. In addition to role responsibilities, organizational culture is the bedrock of the employee experience. In fact, 34 percent of new hires who quit within the first 90 days from a job do so because of company culture not meeting expectations.\n\n“While some periods of turnover are natural, chronically high turnover can be symptomatic of a company culture that leadership needs to act quickly to remedy,” Grill-Rachman said.\n\nManagers and Leadership\n\nManagers interact with their direct reports regularly, so it makes sense that they have a significant impact on employees’ overall engagement.\n\n“In today’s work environment, managers are the biggest drivers of culture,” Grill-Rachman said. “Employees have expectations of their managers, and they are rightfully more scrutinized for the kind of environments they create.”\n\nIn order for a business to be successful, every member of the team must have confidence in the leadership team and feel valued. Otherwise, employees will look elsewhere.\n\nLack of Growth Opportunities\n\nA career plateau is a driving force of voluntary employee turnover. It’s widely understood that professional growth is not limited to upward mobility. However, if there aren’t opportunities for continual learning or employee development, you’ll quickly lose top performers who are eager to advance. Of employees looking to quit, 66 percent cite a lack of career advancement opportunities as their reason for leaving.\n\n“Leaders are contributing to high turnover when they’re doing things like not helping employees play to their strengths, or not providing regular feedback and development opportunities,” said Viviani.\n\nOne-Way Communication\n\nEmployees want (and deserve) to have their voices heard. Two-way communication between team members and senior leaders is vital to creating a positive work culture. A lack of transparency when it comes to company performance and team strategy can cause employees to lose faith in their leaders and question whether their ideas are taken into consideration.\n\nNeglecting to ask employees for their ideas and opinions will drive them to look for a new company; companies implementing regular employee feedback see 14.9 percent lower turnover rates.\n\nLack of Employee Recognition\n\nFailing to recognize employee achievements and celebrate successes will make your people feel undervalued. If they believe that their contributions to the company aren’t appreciated, they’ll begin to disengage from their work and seek employment elsewhere. Research shows that companies that have formal employee recognition programs see 31 percent less voluntary turnover than companies without.\n\nHow to Reduce Employee Turnover\n\nThe good news: turnover is preventable. One thing to keep in mind when striving to reduce employee turnover is that the little things at a company matter, and can result in a significant uptick in engagement. And as we know, engaged employees stick around.\n\nUse these following tips as a guide for how to improve retention.\n\n1. Recognize Employees\n\nImplementing an employee recognition program is a low-lift strategy to increase engagement and reduce turnover, as employees who feel more appreciated by employers are less likely to leave. Recognition can be seamlessly integrated into feedback sessions between managers and their direct reports.\n\nStill, go above and beyond by establishing a formal employee recognition program complete with employee spotlights and peer-to-peer recognition opportunities. Leverage your communication platforms to encourage employees to give shoutouts to and thank their colleagues for a job well done. Rewards are another great way to recognize employees for their accomplishments, and they don’t have to be limited solely to monetary prizes.\n\n2. Establish a Feedback Process\n\nAssuming employees are engaged and happy is the first mistake most employers make. Give your people the opportunity to raise concerns and address issues before they become deal-breakers.\n\n“Don’t only focus on ‘flight risks’ but rather, keep a pulse check on how your current employees are feeling by setting up a check-in on a regular basis,” Grill-Rachman said.\n\nThanks to software developments, it’s never been easier to implement regular employee engagement surveys for collecting anonymous feedback. Conduct stay interviews to keep tabs on what keeps great employees around. You can further automate your feedback process by implementing one of these top employee engagement tools.\n\n3. Promote Your Core Values\n\nCore values are the backbone of a strong company culture. When done correctly, core values guide business decisions, give purpose to your mission statement and inform how employees interact with one another. Furthermore, having an agreed-upon, public-facing list of core values ensures you hire the right people and continue to cultivate a positive work culture as your business scales.\n\nTake the time to carefully consider your list of core values. Engage the leadership team, members of the HR department and some of your most-tenured employees to be a part of the conversation. Keep your list of values concise so as to be intentional and actionable. Once the list is finalized, instruct your team in the new core values and make value training a part of your onboarding process.\n\n4. Implement Your Company Mission\n\nIn addition to being able to see the impact of their own work on the organization’s success, employees want to work for a company that’s making a difference. Finalize your company mission so every individual is working toward a common goal beyond just profit margins.\n\n“Understand what motivates your people, and how to get the best out of them,” said Viviani. “Show your people the future they can have with your company by expanding their skills and experiences while staying with you.”\n\n5. Enhance Your Benefits Package\n\nThe benefits and perks you offer are an integral part of your employee value proposition (EVP) and a direct reflection of your company culture.\n\n“While it’s true that many companies are offering sky-high salaries and bonuses to win talent, that won’t keep them in the long run,” Grill-Rachman said. “Invest in your employees, not just new hires, by providing perks programs, strong healthcare benefits and generous PTO.”\n\nUse information collected during exit and stay interviews to refine your employer offerings with benefits that employees want. Showing you care about your people as human beings, not just employees, will help you earn their trust and respect as an empathetic employer. This reputation will also help you attract and retain great talent; 88 percent of employees feel that empathetic leadership creates loyalty among employees toward their company.\n\n6. Conduct Exit Interviews\n\nOne of the most effective, yet frequently overlooked, solutions to turnover is an exit interview process. Don’t squander the opportunity to learn from your mistakes as an employer by dismissing a great employee without asking them where you went wrong. When they’re headed out the door, employees are more likely to be candid about their grievances and provide honest feedback. You can then use this information to make improvements that matter to employees who are sticking around.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",
      "# [Unconscious Bias: Definition and Examples by Bailey Reiners on 2023-02-08](https://builtin.com/diversity-inclusion/unconscious-bias-examples)\nUnconscious bias, or implicit bias, describes a subconscious attitude that affects the way individuals feel and think about others around them. Subconscious attitudes aren’t necessarily as well-formed as coherent thoughts, but they can be very ingrained and impact the emotional and rational responses of individuals in everyday situations.\n\nWhat Is Unconscious Bias?\n\nUnconscious bias refers to a prejudice or stereotype an individual may hold about a particular group of people that they aren’t fully aware of. Also known as implicit bias, this bias can be directed toward people of certain races, gender identities, sexual orientations, physical abilities or even personal traits.\n\nBiases and prejudices often develop in early childhood as children begin to make assumptions based on personal experiences. They may also receive stereotypes from parents, education systems and other cultural institutions, as well as from popular forms of media such as books, movies and television. As a result, unconscious biases can be forged over many years while going undetected.\n\nSome of the most common types of unconscious biases are in how individuals regard their own thought processes and reasoning abilities, such as focusing on negative qualities of individuals that align with one’s existing attitudes — like in confirmation bias and affirmation bias.\n\nOther unconscious biases are directly related to how other people may look. These types of biases tend to rely on stereotypes and can result in discriminatory practices when people are not treated like individuals, such as racism, ageism and beauty bias.\n\n18 Examples of Unconscious Bias in the Workplace\n\nWe’ve identified 18 types of unconscious bias that commonly affect candidates and employees, and also provided some tips for how to avoid them when hiring and retaining employees.\n\n1. Affinity Bias\n\nAffinity bias, also known as similarity bias, is the tendency people have to connect with others who share similar interests, experiences and backgrounds.\n\nWhen companies hire for “culture fit,” they are likely falling prey to affinity bias. When hiring teams meet someone they like and who they know will get along with the team, it’s more often than not because that person shares similar interests, experiences and backgrounds, which is not helping your team grow and diversify. While similarities shouldn’t automatically disqualify a candidate, they should never be the deciding factor, either.\n\nHow to Avoid Affinity Bias\n\nTo avoid affinity bias, actively take note of the similarities you share with the candidate so that you can differentiate between attributes that may cloud your judgment and the concrete skills, experiences and unique qualities that would contribute to your team as a “culture add” rather than “culture fit.”\n\n2. Ageism\n\nAgeism in the workplace is the tendency to have negative feelings about another person based on their age.\n\nAgeism affects older people more often than younger people. About two-thirds of workers aged 50 and over believe older employees face discrimination because of their age. The later employees are in their careers, the more difficult it is to change careers, find a job or move up in their careers because employers tend to value younger talent — even though experience and expertise are critical skills for any successful business.\n\nHow to Avoid Ageism\n\nTo avoid ageism in the workplace, train your team members to understand the issue of ageism and debunk some of the myths about workers of different ages. Your company should also create a policy that prevents age bias along with hiring goals to keep age diversity top of mind when recruiting new talent.\n\n3. Anchor Bias\n\nAnchor bias, or expectation anchor bias, is when someone holds onto an initial, singular piece of information to make decisions.\n\nAnchor bias commonly occurs in the hiring process while comparing candidates. A recruiter may see one aspect of a candidate and then cannot “unsee” that characteristic while considering other applicants. For example, the first applicant a recruiter considers may request a significantly lower salary than the following candidates. This can create an expectation anchor bias that the latter candidates are asking for too much.\n\nHow to Avoid Anchor Bias\n\nTo avoid anchor bias, try to compare every aspect of a candidate and never rely on one singular piece of information as a deciding factor. If you find yourself coming back to one piece of information you’re comparing against, try omitting that anchoring piece of information and comparing candidates based on their other characteristics and qualifications.\n\n4. Attribution Bias\n\nAttribution bias is a phenomenon where you try to make sense of or judge a person’s behavior based on prior observations and interactions you’ve had with that individual that make up your perception of them.\n\nWhile this may seem harmless, humans are quick to judge and falsely assume things about a person without knowing their full story. When hiring, attribution bias can cause hiring managers and recruiters to determine a candidate unfit for the job because of something unusual on their resume or unexpected behavior during the interview.\n\nHow to Avoid Attribution Bias\n\nRather than assume a candidate is unfit for a job because they were late to the interview, ask them what happened — it could be totally innocent and unprecedented. If there is something on their resume or something they said during the interview that caused you to draw conclusions about the candidate, ask them further clarifying questions. Don’t forget that interviewees are often nervous and may misspeak or stumble. Give them a chance to share their full story with you before you judge.\n\n5. Authority Bias\n\nAuthority bias refers to when an idea or opinion is given more attention or thought to be more accurate because it was provided by an authority figure.\n\nAuthority bias is very easy to find in the workplace because hierarchies are already in place. Existing hierarchies make it incredibly easy to simply follow the leader, even if the leader’s ideas aren’t what is best for the company or their employees. But putting too much trust and power in leadership roles can limit employee engagement, hinder employees’ professional growth and ultimately damage a company’s ability to innovate.\n\nHow to Avoid Authority Bias\n\nAvoiding authority bias can be difficult depending on the culture of a workplace. One of the best ways to avoid this bias is to foster an environment of ideas, where others speak up and voice their own opinions and ideas.\n\n6. Beauty Bias\n\nBeauty bias is a social behavior where people believe that those they perceive as attractive are more successful, competent and qualified.\n\nWhile appearance (race aside) is not protected by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, it is a form of bias that is prominent in the workplace. Many people connect conventional beauty to higher levels of intelligence, social skills and physical health. Workers considered physically attractive can go on to earn up to 15 percent more than workers considered less physically attractive. At the same time, candidates considered physically attractive may also be discriminated against by hiring teams due to perceived entitlement.\n\nHow to Avoid Beauty Bias\n\nTo avoid beauty bias, companies should create structured recruiting and interview processes so that your team will be able to compare applications and interviews equally and reduce the risk of bias. Phone screenings (as opposed to video calls) and unbiased technologies can also help teams identify top candidates.\n\n7. Confirmation Bias\n\nConfirmation bias is the inclination to draw conclusions about a situation or person based on your personal desires, beliefs and prejudices rather than on unbiased merit.\n\nIn hiring, confirmation bias often plays a detrimental role at the very beginning of the process when you first review a resume and form an initial opinion of the candidate based on inconsequential attributes like their name, where they’re from, where they went to school and so forth. This opinion can follow you into the interview process and consequently steer questions to confirm the initial opinion of the candidate.\n\nHow to Avoid Confirmation Bias\n\nWhile every interview will lend itself to a unique conversation based on the individual’s background, it’s important to ask standardized, skills-based questions that provide each candidate with a fair chance to stand out. This will help prevent your team from asking too many off-the-cuff questions that may lead to confirmation bias.\n\n8. Conformity Bias\n\nConformity bias, more commonly known as peer pressure, is the tendency people have to act similar to the people around them regardless of their own personal beliefs or idiosyncrasies.\n\nWhen your hiring team gets together to review a candidate’s application materials and conduct the interview, conformity bias can cause individuals to sway their opinion of a candidate to match the opinion of the majority. The problem is the majority is not always right, which may cause your team to miss out on an excellent candidate because individual opinions become muddled in a group setting.\n\nHow to Avoid Conformity Bias\n\nBefore you get your hiring team together to review a candidate, have them all write down and submit their individual opinions separate from one another immediately after the interview ends. Then have your team come together and review what everyone wrote down so you can hear their impartial opinions and avoid conformity bias in the process.\n\n9. Contrast Effect\n\nThe contrast effect is when you compare two or more things that you have come into contact with — either simultaneously or one after another — causing you to exaggerate the performance of one in contrast to the other.\n\nThis one is a bit of a mind-bender, but it’s also one of the most common types of bias in the recruiting industry. When you’re reviewing loads of candidates, it can be easy to compare one application to the next in the stack and determine which one is better than the other. An exceptionally good interview with one candidate may make the next one seem terrible.\n\nHow to Avoid the Contrast Effect\n\nTo avoid the contrast effect, create a structured applicant review and interview process so that your team will be able to compare applications and interview answers as apples-to-apples rather than apples-to-oranges. This also goes for performance reviews and rewards for individual employees.\n\n10. Gender Bias\n\nGender bias is the tendency to prefer one gender over another gender.\n\nToo often men are given preferential treatment over women in the workplace. According to Lean In’s Women in the Workplace study, women only occupy about 25 percent of C-suite executive positions, and for every 100 men promoted from entry-level to manager roles, only 87 women are promoted.\n\nHow to Avoid Gender Bias\n\nAvoid gender bias by conducting anonymous screenings of applications that exclude aspects of a candidate that may reveal their assumed gender, like name and interests. Set diversity hiring goals to ensure your company holds itself accountable to equitable hiring practices. And again, make sure to compare candidates based on skill and merit rather than traits that can cloud your judgment of them.\n\n11. Halo Effect\n\nThe halo effect is the tendency people have to place another person on a pedestal after learning something impressive about them.\n\nThe halo effect can come into play at any stage of the hiring process. You may see a candidate worked at a highly regarded company or graduated from an elite school, but if there’s anything we’ve learned about the 2019 college admissions scandal, it’s to not judge a candidate on the merit of their name-brand education.\n\nHow to Avoid the Halo Effect\n\nThe halo effect can be dangerously blinding when it comes to reviewing candidates, but it can be avoided. When reviewing a stack of applications, you are probably looking for something unique that makes a candidate stand out from the rest. When you do this, also consider the candidate without that one gleaming attribute and see how their experiences, skills and personalities compare to other candidates who may not have had the same privileges or opportunities.\n\n12. Height Bias\n\nHeight bias or heightism is the tendency to judge a person who is significantly short or tall.\n\nThis may seem a bit far-fetched, but one study found that one’s annual earnings can increase up to 13 percent with an additional centimeter in height. Another study found that tall candidates are perceived as more competent, employable and healthy, which may explain why 58 percent of male CEOs at major companies are over six feet tall.\n\nHow to Avoid Height Bias\n\nConducting anonymous interviews, phone interviews or video interviews will reduce your susceptibility to judge a person based on their height. Also, simply knowing that this bias is a common social behavior will help you identify your bias against candidates.\n\n13. Horn Effect\n\nThe horn effect is the tendency people have to view another person negatively after learning something unpleasant or negative about them.\n\nThe direct opposite of the halo effect, the horn effect can cause hiring teams to weed out candidates based on a trait that is averse to the team’s preferences. This could be something as trivial as the candidate working with a company you personally dislike or the candidate displaying a particular quirk or mannerism during the interview. Such traits may alter your perception of the candidate entirely even though it’s a small factor that may not even be relevant.\n\nHow to Avoid the Horn Effect\n\nIf you have a negative feeling about a candidate, take the time to figure out exactly where that gut feeling is coming from. It may be something superficial or insignificant that shouldn’t affect their chance at the role. You may also want to check with the rest of the interviewing team to understand the root of their opinions and preferences about a candidate.\n\n14. Name Bias\n\nName bias is the tendency people have to judge and prefer people with certain types of names — typically names that are of Anglo origin.\n\nThis is one of the most pervasive examples of unconscious bias in the hiring process, and the numbers bear it out.One study found that white names receive significantly more callbacks for interviews than Black names. Another study found that Asian last names are 28 percent less likely to receive a callback for an interview compared to Anglo last names.\n\nHow to Avoid Name Bias\n\nName bias can be avoided if you omit the candidate’s name and personal information — like email, phone number and address — from their application materials. You can either do this by assigning candidates a number or have an unbiased third-party team member omit this information for the hiring team until they bring a candidate in to interview. This will ensure that hiring teams are selecting candidates based on their skills and experiences without the influence of irrelevant personal information.\n\n15. Nonverbal Bias\n\nNonverbal bias is analyzing nonverbal communication attributes such as body language and letting it affect a decision or opinion.\n\nWhen you meet a candidate for an interview, nonverbal bias can creep in. Whether it’s a weak handshake, folded arms or difficulty holding eye contact, it’s easy to take these cues as disinterest, overconfidence or an overall negative attitude. It’s important to remember that the way a person moves through the world is not indicative of their true intentions or whether they will be a successful addition to your team or not.\n\nHow to Avoid Nonverbal Bias\n\nRemember that everyone is different — this includes their mannerisms and ways of communicating physically. For example, if a candidate keeps their arms crossed in an interview, perhaps it’s simply a nervous response. You can teach someone to uncross their arms, but that doesn’t mean they will bring the necessary skills to their position.\n\n16. Overconfidence Bias\n\nThe overconfidence bias refers to a person’s tendency to be more confident in their capabilities than they should be.\n\nOverconfidence bias may not lead to the kinds of hiring and recruiting issues other biases cause, but it can create conflict within an organization and cause a company to not live up to its potential. When overconfidence bias is allowed to flow freely, companies or employees with this bias do not believe they need to make improvements, thus affecting their own growth as well as the company’s growth.\n\nHow to Avoid Overconfidence Bias\n\nOne way to avoid overconfidence bias is to continue your work on affinity bias and hire a diverse team that doesn’t fall into the groupthink trap. It will be more difficult for overconfidence to take over if you foster a diverse and challenging environment.\n\n17. Status Quo Bias\n\nStatus quo bias is a preference for things to remain the way they are and a resistance to change.\n\nFor example, employees who are used to working with a specific software platform may object to the company’s decision to implement a more advanced platform with simpler workflows. If companies don’t establish a culture that accepts change, it only becomes harder to adopt new technologies and stay ahead of the competition.\n\nHow to Avoid Status Quo Bias\n\nDeveloping a culture of innovation can help you avoid status quo bias. In this environment, employees can feel more comfortable experimenting with different ideas and new tools and workflows. If larger organizational changes are occurring, company leaders can emphasize the benefits of the change to frame it in a more positive way for employees.\n\n18. Illusory Correlation\n\nIllusory correlation refers to thinking there’s a connection between two variables when there’s no evidence to back up this claim.\n\nThis kind of bias can go hand-in-hand with stereotyping employees in the workplace. For example, say a manager has a negative experience with an employee of a particular ethnic background. That manager may then make an illusory correlation and falsely assume they’ll have a negative experience with employees of the same ethnic background.\n\nHow to Avoid Illusory Correlation\n\nEducate employees on this type of bias and how it can fuel false assumptions. DEI and bias training focused on stereotypes can be an effective method to help workers become more aware of this bias.\n\nHow to Reduce and Prevent Unconscious Bias\n\nTo seriously address unconscious biases, commit to some long-term strategies. The following ideas enable businesses to cultivate more welcoming workplaces that a wider range of candidates will want to join.\n\n1. Unconscious Bias Training\n\nEducation is an important step in becoming more aware of unconscious biases. Conduct unconscious bias training programs to teach employees how factors like language can alienate candidates and coworkers. Training sessions are also an excellent opportunity to set expectations for how leaders should enforce diverse, equitable and inclusive practices going forward.\n\n2. Diversity Hiring Goals\n\nSeek out diverse sources of talent by opening up positions to remote candidates, which broadens the candidate pool to include people of varying life experiences, and targeting historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs).\n\n3. Talent Assessments and Candidate Scorecards\n\nDevelop objective interview and hiring methods. Talent assessments and interview scorecards create a common structure for grading all candidates, which ensures interviews stay the course and don’t dive too deep into candidates’ personal backgrounds.\n\n4. Different Interview Techniques and Formats\n\nDiversify your interview tactics and formats to make your interview process less prone to bias. Phone interviews are a great way to prevent beauty bias from influencing recruiting decisions. A common set of pre-interview questions is another interview technique that creates a more standard, less biased interview setup.\n\n5. Diverse and Inclusive Culture\n\nAddressing unconscious biases is just one of the many DEI initiatives companies should be investing in. Leaders should collaborate with HR to develop guidelines and policies that serve as the foundation for a diverse and inclusive culture. This is a more holistic approach that proves DEI is a permanent part of a company’s identity, not just a catchphrase.\n\nImportance of Addressing Unconscious Biases\n\nAcknowledging and resolving unconscious biases can help improve many aspects of an organization, from recruiting to retention.\n\nStronger Recruiting\n\nAccording to a 2023 Pew Research survey, 78 percent of Black workers and 61 percent of workers who are women believe focusing on DEI in the workplace is a good thing. If a company has a good track record when it comes to DEI initiatives, job seekers of marginalized groups may want to join.\n\nMore Career Advancement\n\nFor every 100 men promoted from an entry-level position to a manager role, 87 women received a promotion, and this number falls to 73 for women of color. Giving employees of various backgrounds the support they need to thrive in the workplace may lead them to stick around longer.\n\nInnovation and Productivity\n\nA 2023 McKinsey report found that companies with the most women representation and ethnic diversity were 39 percent more likely to outperform companies with the least women representation and ethnic diversity. Diverse teams often display a range of perspectives, leading to the exchange of more ideas and creative solutions that give a business a competitive edge.\n\nHealthy Work Environment\n\nLetting unconscious biases fester can lead to outright discrimination and create a hostile workplace, potentially pushing employees of marginalized identities out of the company. By contrast, a healthy work environment is one where workers have awareness of — and ultimately address — their unconscious biases.\n\nIncreased Employee Engagement\n\nA bias-filled workplace can become a toxic workplace, where employees are exposed to bullying and harassment. This can have devastating consequences for employees’ mental health. Companies that take steps to address unconscious biases can protect employees and show them they’re appreciated. In return, employees will feel more motivated to work hard, contributing to higher levels of employee engagement.\n\nImproved Retention\n\nIf company leadership lets unconscious biases drive harmful behavior, employees may decide a change of scenery is needed. A 2023 INTOO study found that over a third of workers would take a pay cut to leave a toxic work environment for a less toxic one. Organizations that proactively tackle unconscious biases and negative actions can cultivate safer and more positive work environments, making it easier to retain employees.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",
      "# [AI in Healthcare: Uses, Examples & Benefits by Sam Daley on 2022-06-10](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-healthcare)\nArtificial intelligence simplifies the lives of patients, doctors and hospital administrators by performing tasks that are typically done by humans, but in less time and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nAI in healthcare shows up in a number of ways, such as finding new links between genetic codes, powering surgery-assisting robots, automating administrative tasks, personalizing treatment options and much more.\n\nPut simply, AI is reinventing — and reinvigorating — modern healthcare through machines that can predict, comprehend, learn and act.\n\nWhat Is AI in Healthcare?\n\nAI in healthcare refers to the use of machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning and other AI technologies to enhance the experiences of both healthcare professionals and patients. The data-processing and predictive capabilities of AI enable health professionals to better manage their resources and take a more proactive approach to various aspects of healthcare.\n\nWith these technologies, doctors can then make quicker and more accurate diagnoses, health administrators can locate electronic health records faster and patients can receive more timely and personalized treatments.\n\nExamples of AI in Healthcare\n\nTo give you a better understanding of the rapidly evolving field, we rounded up some examples and use cases of AI in healthcare.\n\nAI in Medical Diagnosis\n\nEvery year, roughly 400,000 hospitalized patients suffer preventable harm, with 100,000 deaths. In light of that, the promise of improving the diagnostic process is one of AI’s most exciting healthcare applications. Incomplete medical histories and large caseloads can lead to deadly human errors. Immune to those variables, AI can predict and diagnose disease at a faster rate than most medical professionals.\n\nAI in Drug Discovery\n\nThe drug development industry is bogged down by skyrocketing development costs and research that takes thousands of human hours. Putting each drug through clinical trials costs an estimated average of $1.3 billion, and only 10 percent of those drugs are successfully brought to market. Due to breakthroughs in technology, AI is speeding up this process by helping design drugs, predicting any side effects and identifying ideal candidates for clinical trials.\n\nAI in Patient Experience\n\nAI can be used to support digital communications, offering schedule reminders, tailored health tips and suggested next steps to patients. The ability of AI to aid in health diagnoses also improves the speed and accuracy of patient visits, leading to faster and more personalized care. And efficiently providing a seamless patient experience allows hospitals, clinics and physicians to treat more patients on a daily basis.\n\nAI in Healthcare Data Management\n\nHighly valuable information can sometimes get lost among the forest of trillions of data points. Additionally, the inability to connect important data points slows the development of new drugs, preventative medicine and proper diagnosis. Because of its ability to handle massive volumes of data, AI breaks down data silos and connects in minutes information that used to take years to process. This can reduce the time and costs of healthcare administrative processes, contributing to more efficient daily operations and patient experiences.\n\nAI in Robotic Surgery\n\nHospitals use AI and robots to help with everything from minimally invasive procedures to open heart surgery. Surgeons can control a robot’s mechanical arms while seated at a computer console as the robot gives the doctor a three-dimensional, magnified view of the surgical site. The surgeon then leads other team members who work closely with the robot through the entire operation. Robot-assisted surgeries have led to fewer surgery-related complications, less pain and a quicker recovery time.\n\nCompanies Using AI in Healthcare\n\nThese are some of the companies paving the way for healthcare innovation by applying AI technology.\n\nLocation: New York, New York\n\nEliseAI specializes in conversational AI solutions.

      "# [Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Explained by Zakaria Jaadi on 2021-04-01](https://builtin.com/data-science/step-step-explanation-principal-component-analysis)\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is a widely covered machine learning method on the web. And while there are some great articles about it, many go into too much detail. Below we cover how principal component analysis works in a simple step-by-step way, so everyone can understand it and make use of it — even those without a strong mathematical background.\n\nPrincipal component analysis can be broken down into five steps. I’ll go through each step, providing logical explanations of what PCA is doing and simplifying mathematical concepts such as standardization, covariance, eigenvectors and eigenvalues without focusing on how to compute them.\n\nFirst, some basic (and brief) background is necessary for context.\n\nWhat Is Principal Component Analysis?\n\nPrincipal component analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.\n\nReducing the number of variables of a data set naturally comes at the expense of accuracy, but the trick in dimensionality reduction is to trade a little accuracy for simplicity. Because smaller data sets are easier to explore and visualize, and thus make analyzing data points much easier and faster for machine learning algorithms without extraneous variables to process.\n\nSo, to sum up, the idea of PCA is simple: reduce the number of variables of a data set, while preserving as much information as possible.\n\nWhat Are Principal Components?\n\nPrincipal components are new variables that are constructed as linear combinations or mixtures of the initial variables. These combinations are done in such a way that the new variables (i.e., principal components) are uncorrelated and most of the information within the initial variables is squeezed or compressed into the first components. So, the idea is 10-dimensional data gives you 10 principal components, but PCA tries to put maximum possible information in the first component, then maximum remaining information in the second and so on, until having something like shown in the scree plot below.\n\nOrganizing information in principal components this way will allow you to reduce dimensionality without losing much information, and this by discarding the components with low information and considering the remaining components as your new variables.\n\nAn important thing to realize here is that the principal components are less interpretable and don’t have any real meaning since they are constructed as linear combinations of the initial variables.\n\nGeometrically speaking, principal components represent the directions of the data that explain a maximal amount of variance, that is to say, the lines that capture most information of the data. The relationship between variance and information here, is that, the larger the variance carried by a line, the larger the dispersion of the data points along it, and the larger the dispersion along a line, the more information it has. To put all this simply, just think of principal components as new axes that provide the best angle to see and evaluate the data, so that the differences between the observations are better visible.\n\nHow PCA Constructs the Principal Components\n\nAs there are as many principal components as there are variables in the data, principal components are constructed in such a manner that the first principal component accounts for the largest possible variance in the data set. For example, let’s assume that the scatter plot of our data set is as shown below, can we guess the first principal component ? Yes, it’s approximately the line that matches the purple marks because it goes through the origin and it’s the line in which the projection of the points (red dots) is the most spread out. Or mathematically speaking, it’s the line that maximizes the variance (the average of the squared distances from the projected points (red dots) to the origin).\n\nThe second principal component is calculated in the same way, with the condition that it is uncorrelated with (i.e., perpendicular to) the first principal component and that it accounts for the next highest variance.\n\nThis continues until a total of p principal components have been calculated, equal to the original number of variables.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation of PCA\n\nStep 1: Standardization\n\nThe aim of this step is to standardize the range of the continuous initial variables so that each one of them contributes equally to the analysis.\n\nMore specifically, the reason why it is critical to perform standardization prior to PCA, is that the latter is quite sensitive regarding the variances of the initial variables. That is, if there are large differences between the ranges of initial variables, those variables with larger ranges will dominate over those with small ranges (for example, a variable that ranges between 0 and 100 will dominate over a variable that ranges between 0 and 1), which will lead to biased results. So, transforming the data to comparable scales can prevent this problem.\n\nMathematically, this can be done by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each value of each variable.\n\nOnce the standardization is done, all the variables will be transformed to the same scale.\n\nStep 2: Covariance Matrix Computation\n\nThe aim of this step is to understand how the variables of the input data set are varying from the mean with respect to each other, or in other words, to see if there is any relationship between them. Because sometimes, variables are highly correlated in such a way that they contain redundant information. So, in order to identify these correlations, we compute the covariance matrix.\n\nThe covariance matrix is a p × p symmetric matrix (where p is the number of dimensions) that has as entries the covariances associated with all possible pairs of the initial variables. For example, for a 3-dimensional data set with 3 variables x, y, and z, the covariance matrix is a 3×3 data matrix of this from:\n\nSince the covariance of a variable with itself is its variance (Cov(a,a)=Var(a)), in the main diagonal (Top left to bottom right) we actually have the variances of each initial variable. And since the covariance is commutative (Cov(a,b)=Cov(b,a)), the entries of the covariance matrix are symmetric with respect to the main diagonal, which means that the upper and the lower triangular portions are equal.\n\nWhat do the covariances that we have as entries of the matrix tell us about the correlations between the variables?\n\nIt’s actually the sign of the covariance that matters:\n\nIf positive then: the two variables increase or decrease together (correlated)\n\nIf negative then: one increases when the other decreases (Inversely correlated)\n\nNow that we know that the covariance matrix is not more than a table that summarizes the correlations between all the possible pairs of variables, let’s move to the next step.\n\nStep 3: Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix to identify the principal components\n\nEigenvectors and eigenvalues are the linear algebra concepts that we need to compute from the covariance matrix in order to determine the principal components of the data.\n\nWhat you first need to know about eigenvectors and eigenvalues is that they always come in pairs, so that every eigenvector has an eigenvalue. Also, their number is equal to the number of dimensions of the data. For example, for a 3-dimensional data set, there are 3 variables, therefore there are 3 eigenvectors with 3 corresponding eigenvalues.\n\nIt is eigenvectors and eigenvalues who are behind all the magic of principal components because the eigenvectors of the Covariance matrix are actually the directions of the axes where there is the most variance (most information) and that we call Principal Components. And eigenvalues are simply the coefficients attached to eigenvectors, which give the amount of variance carried in each Principal Component.\n\nBy ranking your eigenvectors in order of their eigenvalues, highest to lowest, you get the principal components in order of significance.\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis Example:\n\nLet’s suppose that our data set is 2-dimensional with 2 variables x,y and that the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are as follows:\n\nIf we rank the eigenvalues in descending order, we get λ1>λ2, which means that the eigenvector that corresponds to the first principal component (PC1) is v1 and the one that corresponds to the second principal component (PC2) is v2.\n\nAfter having the principal components, to compute the percentage of variance (information) accounted for by each component, we divide the eigenvalue of each component by the sum of eigenvalues. If we apply this on the example above, we find that PC1 and PC2 carry respectively 96 percent and 4 percent of the variance of the data.\n\nStep 4: Create a Feature Vector\n\nAs we saw in the previous step, computing the eigenvectors and ordering them by their eigenvalues in descending order, allow us to find the principal components in order of significance. In this step, what we do is, to choose whether to keep all these components or discard those of lesser significance (of low eigenvalues), and form with the remaining ones a matrix of vectors that we call Feature vector.\n\nSo, the feature vector is simply a matrix that has as columns the eigenvectors of the components that we decide to keep. This makes it the first step towards dimensionality reduction, because if we choose to keep only p eigenvectors (components) out of n, the final data set will have only p dimensions.\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis Example:\n\nContinuing with the example from the previous step, we can either form a feature vector with both of the eigenvectors v1 and v2:\n\nOr discard the eigenvector v2, which is the one of lesser significance, and form a feature vector with v1 only:\n\nDiscarding the eigenvector v2 will reduce dimensionality by 1, and will consequently cause a loss of information in the final data set. But given that v2 was carrying only 4 percent of the information, the loss will be therefore not important and we will still have 96 percent of the information that is carried by v1.\n\nSo, as we saw in the example, it’s up to you to choose whether to keep all the components or discard the ones of lesser significance, depending on what you are looking for. Because if you just want to describe your data in terms of new variables (principal components) that are uncorrelated without seeking to reduce dimensionality, leaving out lesser significant components is not needed.\n\nStep 5: Recast the Data Along the Principal Components Axes\n\nIn the previous steps, apart from standardization, you do not make any changes on the data, you just select the principal components and form the feature vector, but the input data set remains always in terms of the original axes (i.e, in terms of the initial variables).\n\nIn this step, which is the last one, the aim is to use the feature vector formed using the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, to reorient the data from the original axes to the ones represented by the principal components (hence the name Principal Components Analysis). This can be done by multiplying the transpose of the original data set by the transpose of the feature vector.\n\nReferences:\n\n[Steven M.

      "# [Strong AI vs. Weak AI: What's the Difference? by Ellen Glover on 2022-09-29](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/strong-ai-weak-ai)\nAs artificial intelligence continues to grow more advanced, the threshold of what can be considered true intelligence continues to get more complicated to define.\n\nExperts insist that these machines aren’t as intelligent as humans — at least not yet. The existence of strong AI, or artificial intelligence that is capable of learning and thinking like humans do, remains theoretical for now.\n\nUntil then, we will have to settle for the type of artificial intelligence that exists today: weak AI, which focuses and excels in completing very specific tasks.\n\nBelow we dive deep into how strong AI and weak AI compare — and what we can expect from these technologies going forward.\n\nWhat Is Strong AI?\n\nStrong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence or AGI, is capable of behaving and performing actions in the same ways human beings can. AGI mimics human intelligence, and is able to solve problems and learn news skills in ways similar to our own.\n\n“The more an AI system approaches the abilities of a human being, with all the intelligence, emotion, and broad applicability of knowledge, the more ‘strong’ the AI system is considered,” Kathleen Walch, a managing partner at Cognilytica’s Cognitive Project Management for AI certification and co-host of the AI Today podcast, told Built In.\n\nStrong AI can generalize knowledge and apply that knowledge from one task to another, plan ahead according to current knowledge and adapt to an environment as changes occur, she added. “Once a system is able to do all of this, it would be considered AGI.”\n\nMore on AIThe Future of AI: How Artificial Intelligence Will Change the World\n\nExamples of Strong AI\n\nBecause it doesn’t actually exist yet, the only true examples of AGI are found in works of science fiction like Star Trek: The Next Generation, Wall-E and Her.\n\nIn practice, strong AI would be a game-changer for humanity. A computer with artificial general intelligence could scan all the world’s knowledge housed on the internet to solve some of the world’s most pressing problems, or even predict and address them before they come into existence in the first place.\n\n“The dream of strong AI,” said James Rolfsen, the global head of data analytics at Rappi, “is this idea of building an intelligent system which is capable of mastering not just a prespecified skill or prespecified objective, but of actually engineering a system that can dynamically adapt to any decision-making environment.”\n\nAs for a timeline, Rolfsen added, “I think we’re a lot closer than everybody knows.”\n\nThe Promise and Perils of Strong AI\n\nThe prospect of strong AI becoming so advanced that it surpasses human intelligence and capabilities breeds quite a bit of fear. Some of these fears include AGI taking over the world, or that all our data and privacy will be lost to AI.\n\nWalch insists that many of the fears people have regarding AI are “emotional more than [they are] rational.” However, she added, there are some valid concerns about AI that need to be dealt with, including lack of transparency (especially regarding deep learning), people misusing AI for nefarious purposes, bias, lack of security, and governments’ general ignorance when it comes to dealing with this technology legislatively.\n\nGoing forward, if people continue to feel threatened by increasingly sophisticated AI systems, there will be “major resistance,” according to Walch.\n\nAre We Close to Having Strong AI?\n\nWhile AI that is fully capable of learning, thinking and behaving like a real person doesn’t exist, there are some remarkably sophisticated systems out there approaching the AGI benchmark.\n\nOne of them is GPT-4, a multimodal large language model designed by OpenAI that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. GPT-4 and is not intelligent, per se, but it has been used to perform some extraordinary feats, including passing the bar exam, understanding image-based jokes and coding playable video games in seconds.\n\nAnother is MuZero, a computer program created by Google DeepMind that has managed to master games it has not even been taught how to play, including chess and an entire suite of Atari games, through sheer brute force in re-playing games millions of times.\n\nAt This Point You May Be WonderingWhat Can’t AI Do?\n\nWhat Is Weak AI?\n\nWeak AI is also known as specialized AI or narrow AI. It has the ability to perform very specialized tasks — much of the time even more successfully than humans.\n\nWeak AI is easily the most successful realization of AI to date. Two of the four functionality-based types of artificial intelligence fall under its umbrella: reactive machines and limited memory machines. Reactive machines are the most fundamental kind of AI in that they can respond to immediate requests and tasks, but aren’t capable of storing memory or learning from past experiences. Limited memory is the next step in AI’s evolution, which allows machines to store knowledge and use it to learn and train for future tasks.\n\nWeak AI’s limited functionality allows it to automate that specific task with ease, and its narrow focus has allowed it to power many technological breakthroughs in just the last few years.\n\nMore on AIAI Ethics: A Guide to Ethical AI\n\nExamples of Weak AI\n\nOne of the first, most famous examples of weak AI is Deep Blue, a computer created by IBM that beat world chess champion Gary Kasparov in a six-game match in 1997. Deep Blue was able to choose from hundreds of millions of moves, and managed to “see” 20 moves ahead of its opponent — a feat no human to date has been able to achieve.\n\nWe see examples of weak AI all around us: Smart assistants like Siri and Alexa are able to set reminders, search for online information and control the lights in people’s homes thanks to its ability to collect users’ information, learn their preferences and improve their experiences based on prior interactions. Self-driving cars use weak AI’s deep neural networks to detect objects around them, determine their distance from other cars, identify traffic signals and much more. Every time you go to Amazon to shop, or scroll through your feed on Facebook, everything you see on a page is personalized so you take the actions the company wants you to, with the help of data and AI.\n\n“People have no idea how much of their lives is actually governed by weak AI,” Rolfsen said.\n\nMore on AIWill We Ever See a Real-Life ‘Star Trek’ Universal Translator?\n\nStrong AI vs. Weak AI vs. Superintelligence\n\nIf weak AI automates specific tasks better than humans, and strong AI thinks and behaves with the same agility of humans, you may be wondering where artificial intelligence can go from there. And the answer is: superintelligence.\n\nA superintelligent machine would be completely self-aware, and surpass the likes of human intelligence in practically every way. And, like artificial general intelligence, it is complete science fiction (for now).\n\nNick Bostrom, a founding professor and leader of Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute, appears to have coined the term back in 1998, and predicted that we will have achieved superhuman artificial intelligence within the first third of the 21st century. In some ways, Rolfsen said, it is already among us in the form of weak AI.\n\nDeep Blue, for example, can play chess better than any human, making it a form of very specific superintelligence. But it’s still not generalized intelligence. Therefore, “we know that Deep Blue is not going to take over the world and enslave humans. We know that’s not going to happen because all Deep Blue knows how to do is play chess,” Rolfsen said.\n\nBut once we accomplish generalized superintelligence, then we’re getting into the possibility of computers potentially outwitting humans in every way — something truly nightmarish or incredibly exciting, depending on how you look at it. Either way, “it’s definitely going to happen,” according to Rolfsen.\n\nMore on AIWhat Is Transhumanism?\n\nHow Will We Know When We’ve Achieved Strong AI and Superintelligence?\n\nIf and when superintelligence — or even true artificial general intelligence — is achieved, how will we know when we’ve encountered an example of it? The answer is more complicated than you might think.\n\nFor a long time, a machine’s intelligence was evaluated with the Turing Test. Developed by Alan Turing in 1950, the test puts a human, a computer and an interrogator in a conversational setting. If the interrogator can’t distinguish between the human and the computer, then the computer has managed to convince the interrogator of its “humanness,” Rolfsen explained, thus rendering its intelligence indistinguishable from that of a human’s.\n\nNowadays, some very advanced chatbots can seemingly pass the Turing Test, despite being pieces of weak AI and, therefore, not as intelligent as humans. Walch said some experts believe that “once an AI system is able to really tell a joke, then you’ll know that it’s crossed over to AGI territory.”\n\n“The immense flexibility of the human mind is what captivates us and makes us believe that humans are different from machines.”\n\nFor Rolfsen, the standards are a bit higher. Generalized intelligence — our ability to adapt in unfamiliar environments using context and previous knowledge — is “one of the things that makes humans magical beings,” he said. We’re not going to just hand that out to any old machine.\n\n“The immense flexibility of the human mind is what captivates us and makes us believe that humans are different from machines,” Rolfsen said. “We’re holding all of these AI systems to a much higher standard than we even realize because we’re holding them to our highest standards [of ourselves].”\n\nFor instance, before Deep Blue, many other AI systems had managed to beat most humans at chess. But the general public wasn’t ready to call those other computers intelligent because, “most humans kind of suck at chess,” as Rolfsen put it. It took Deep Blue beating Gary Kasparov in that 1997 chess match for people to acknowledge that these systems could be considered intelligent in any sense.\n\nNow, as we continue to attempt to capture and digitize all the complexities of human intelligence, we’re not only pushing the limits of what it means to be artificially intelligent, but also what it means to truly be human.\n\n“I’ve actually learned more, a lot more, about humanity and what it means to be a human being by going through the process and attempting to replicate human decision making and human interaction,” Rolfsen said. “By working so intensely and advancing so quickly in our technology around AI, we’re actually learning so much more about what makes us human.”",
      "# [Data Science Projects for Beginners and Experts by Claire D. Costa on 2022-11-18](https://builtin.com/data-science/data-science-projects)\nData science is a profession that requires a variety of scientific tools, processes, algorithms and knowledge extraction systems that are used to identify meaningful patterns in structured and unstructured data alike.\n\nIf you fancy data science and are eager to get a solid grip on the technology, now is as good a time as ever to hone your skills.

Whether you want your chatbot to be domain-specific or open-domain depends on its purpose. As these chatbots process more interactions, their intelligence and accuracy also increase.\n\n2. Credit Card Fraud Detection\n\nLanguage: R or Python\n\nData set: Data on the transaction of credit cards is used here as a data set.\n\nSource code: Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Python\n\nCredit card fraud is more common than you think. In fact, it’s an issue that has now impacted around 60 percent of credit card holders in the United States. But thanks to the innovations in technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science, credit card companies have been able to successfully identify and intercept these frauds with sufficient accuracy.\n\nThe idea behind this is to analyze the customer’s usual spending behavior, including mapping the location of those spendings to identify the fraudulent transactions from the non-fraudulent ones. For this project, you can use either R or Python with the customer’s transaction history as the data set and ingest it into decision trees, artificial neural networks and logistic regression. As you feed more data to your system, you should be able to increase its overall accuracy.\n\n3. Fake News Detection\n\nLanguage: Python\n\nData set/Packages: news.csv\n\nSource code: Detecting Fake News\n\nIn today’s connected world, it’s become ridiculously easy to share fake news over the internet. Every once in a while, you’ll see false information being spread online from unauthorized sources that not only cause problems to the people targeted but also has the potential to cause widespread panic and even violence.\n\nTo curb the spread of fake news, it’s crucial to identify the authenticity of information, which can be done using this data science project. You can use Python and build a model with TfidfVectorizer and PassiveAggressiveClassifier to separate the real news from the fake one. Some Python libraries best suited for this project are pandas, NumPy and scikit-learn. For the data set, you can use News.csv.\n\n4. Forest Fire Prediction\n\nLanguage: Python\n\nData set: Algerian forest fires data set\n\nSource code: Forest Fire Predictor\n\nBuilding a forest fire and wildfire prediction system is another good use of data science’s capabilities. A wildfire or forest fire is an uncontrolled fire in a forest. Every forest wildfire has caused an immense amount of damage to nature, animal habitats and human property.\n\nTo control and even predict the chaotic nature of wildfires, you can use k-means clustering to identify major fire hotspots and their severity. This could be useful in properly allocating resources. You can also make use of meteorological data to find common periods and seasons for wildfires to increase your model’s accuracy.\n\nMore on Data Science: K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm: An Introduction\n\n5.

These opinions could be from a variety of sources, including online reviews and survey responses, and span a range of emotions such as happy, angry, positive, love, negative and excitement.\n\nModern data-driven companies benefit the most from a sentiment analysis tool as it gives them critical insights into customers’ reactions to the dry run of a new product launch or a change in business strategy. To build a system like this, you could use R with janeaustenR’s data set along with the tidytext package.\n\n9. Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nLanguage: Python\n\nPackages: pandas, NumPy, seaborn, and matplotlib\n\nSource code: Exploratory data analysis in Python\n\nExploratory data analysis (EDA) plays a key role in data analysis as it helps you make sense of your data and often involves visualizing data points for better exploration. You can pick from a range of visuals, including histograms, scatterplots or heat maps. EDA can also expose unexpected results and outliers in your data. Once you have identified patterns and derived the necessary insights from your data, you are good to go.\n\nA project of this scale can easily be done with Python, and for the packages, you can use pandas, NumPy, seaborn and matplotlib.\n\nA great source for EDA data sets is the IBM TechXchange Community.\n\n10. Customer Churn Analysis\n\nLanguage: Python\n\nData set: Telco Customer Churn\n\nSource code: Telco Customer Churn options\n\nCustomer churn refers to the percentage of customers who stop using a company’s products or services during a specific time period. Businesses analyze churn to understand what led customers to leave, looking at factors like demographic information, services selected and customer account details. This way, they can identify other at-risk customers likely to leave and take measures to retain them.\n\nOne way to approach this problem is to use Scikit-learn to build a decision tree, which can help predict which customers are at risk of leaving after being trained on churn data. Kaggle offers a churn data set (listed above) to get started, along with various data set notebooks containing unique source code that you can experiment with.\n\n11. Recognizing Speech Emotions\n\nLanguage: Python\n\nData set: RAVDESS\n\nPackages: Librosa, Soundfile, NumPy, Sklearn, Pyaudio\n\nSource code: Speech Emotion Recognition with librosa\n\nSpeech contains a variety of emotions, such as calmness, anger, joy and excitement, to name a few. By analyzing the emotions behind speech, companies can use this information to restructure their actions, services and products to offer more personalized services.\n\nThis project involves identifying and extracting emotions from multiple sound files containing human speech. To make something like this in Python, you can use the Librosa, SoundFile, NumPy, Scikit-learn and PyAudio packages. For the data set, you can use the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS), which contains over 7,300 files.\n\n12. Customer Segmentation\n\nLanguage: R\n\nSource code: Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning\n\nModern businesses strive to deliver highly personalized services to their customers, which would not be possible without some form of customer categorization or segmentation. In doing so, organizations can easily structure their services and products around their customers while targeting them to drive more revenue.\n\nFor this project, you will use unsupervised learning to group your customers into clusters based on individual aspects such as age, gender, region and interests. K-means clustering or hierarchical clustering are suitable here, but you can also experiment with fuzzy clustering or density-based clustering methods. You can use the Mall_Customers data set as sample data.\n\nMore Data Science Project Ideas to Build\n\nVisualizing climate change.\n\nUber’s pickup analysis.\n\nWeb traffic forecasting using time series.\n\nImpact of Climate Change On Global Food Supply.\n\nDetecting Parkinson’s disease.\n\nPokemon data exploration.\n\nEarth surface temperature visualization.\n\nBrain tumor detection with data science.\n\nPredictive policing.\n\nThroughout this article, we’ve covered 12 fun and handy data science project ideas for you to try out.

We reserve, and you grant to us, the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you.\n\n7. DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\nExcept where prohibited by applicable law, this section addresses how any legal dispute between you and Built In will proceed in the unlikely event that such an event should occur.\n\n7.1 INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS\n\nIf you are you are dissatisfied with our Services for any reason, please contact us by email at customer[email protected] so that we can try to resolve your concerns without the need of outside assistance. If you choose to pursue a dispute, claim or controversy against Built In, these Terms will apply. For purposes of this dispute resolution process, Built In shall include our affiliates, employees, licensors, and service providers.\n\nBefore formally pursuing a Dispute (as defined below) in arbitration or small claims court, you agree to first send a detailed notice (\"Notice\") to Built In, Inc., by email at [email protected] or by mail at 222 Merchandise Mart Plaza Suite 2010, Chicago, Illinois 60654. Should Built In have a Dispute with you, Built In agrees to first send a Notice to you at your most recent email address on file with us, or if no email address is on file, using other contact information associated with your account. Any such Notice you provide must contain all of the following information: (1) your full name; (2) additional information that enables Built In to identify you, including your address, mobile phone number, and email address; and (3) a detailed description of your Dispute, including the nature and factual basis of your claim(s) and the relief you are seeking with a corresponding calculation of your alleged damages (if any). Built In’s Notice must likewise set forth a detailed description of its Dispute, which shall include the nature and factual basis of its claim(s) and the relief it is seeking, with a corresponding calculation of our damages (if any).\n\nYou and Built In agree to then negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve the Dispute. As part of these good faith negotiations, if Built In requests a telephone conference with you to discuss your Dispute, you agree to personally participate, with your attorney if you are represented by counsel. Likewise, if you request a telephone conference to discuss Built In’s Dispute with you, Built In agrees to have one representative participate. This informal process should lead to a resolution of the Dispute. However, if the Dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of a fully completed Notice and the Parties have not otherwise mutually agreed to an extension of this informal dispute resolution time period, you or Built In may initiate an arbitration (subject to a Party’s right to elect small claims court as provided below).\n\nCompletion of this informal dispute resolution is a condition precedent to filing any demand for arbitration or small claims court action. Failure to do so is a breach of this agreement. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines will be tolled while you and Built In engage in this informal dispute resolution process. Unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration provider, the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration and shall administratively close any arbitration unless the Party bringing such demand for arbitration can certify in writing that the terms and conditions of this informal dispute resolution process were fully satisfied. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this provision and to enjoin any arbitration proceeding or small claims court action.\n\n7.2 INDIVIDUAL RELIEF: CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER\n\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, YOU AND BUILT IN EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES IN COURT IN FAVOR OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PROVIDED ABOVE). YOU AND BUILT IN EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO FILE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER OR OTHERWISE TO SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS, INCLUDING ANY CURRENTLY PENDING ACTIONS AGAINST YOU OR BUILT IN. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, CONSOLIDATED, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS. THE ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THE SAME RELIEF AVAILABLE IN COURT PROVIDED THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY ONLY AWARD FINAL RELIEF (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE OR DECLARATORY RELIEF) IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE FINAL RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD FINAL RELIEF FOR, AGAINST, OR ON BEHALF OF ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS. IF A COURT DETERMINES THAT ANY OF THESE PROHIBITIONS IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE UNENFORCEABLE AS TO A PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF (SUCH AS A REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF), AND ALL APPEALS OF THAT DECISION ARE EXHAUSTED OR THE DECISION IS OTHERWISE FINAL, THEN YOU AND BUILT IN AGREE THAT THAT PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF SHALL PROCEED IN COURT BUT SHALL BE STAYED PENDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION OF THE REMAINING CLAIMS FOR RELIEF THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT. IF THIS SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION (EXCEPT FOR THE JURY TRIAL WAIVER AND THE INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS) SHALL BE NULL AND VOID. THIS PARAGRAPH IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.\n\n7.3 DISPUTE RESOLUTION THROUGH ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT\n\nAny dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Built In that is not resolved informally by Built In CustomerService or through the informal dispute resolution process that arises from or relates in any way to this agreement (including any alleged breach of this agreement), the Services, or our relationship with you (collectively, “Dispute”), shall be exclusively resolved through BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION except as specifically provided otherwise in this Dispute Resolution Section 7. “Dispute” as used in this agreement shall have the broadest possible meaning and include claims that arose before the existence of this or any prior agreement and claims that arise during the term of this agreement or after the termination of this agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Built In may elect to have an individual claim heard in small claims court. If the request to proceed in small claims court is made after an arbitration has been initiated but before an arbitrator has been appointed, such arbitration shall be administratively closed. Any controversy over the small claims court’s jurisdiction shall be determined by the small claims court. All other issues (except as otherwise provided herein) are exclusively for the Arbitrator to decide, including but not limited to scope and enforceability of this Dispute Resolution Section 7, as well as any request to proceed in small claims court that is made after an arbitrator has been appointed. If you or Built In challenges the small claims court election in your Dispute, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the small claims court election is unenforceable, then such election shall be severed from this agreement as to your Dispute. However, such court determination shall not be considered or deemed binding with respect to Built In’s other contracting parties.\n\nAny court proceeding to enforce this Dispute Resolution Section, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, must be commenced in accordance with the Jurisdiction section of these Terms. In the event this Dispute Resolution Section is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against Built In (except for small claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Delaware. You hereby irrevocably consent to those courts’ exercise of personal jurisdiction over you for such purposes and waive any claim that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.\n\n7.4 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ARBITRATION PROTOCOL\n\nThis subsection applies to Disputes that are submitted to AAA after fully completing the informal Notice and Dispute resolution process described above and when no small claims court election is made by either Party. Any arbitration between you and Built In shall be administered by AAA in accordance with the operative AAA Arbitration Rules (the \"AAA Rules\") in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with AAA, such as the Consumer Arbitration Rules or the Consumer Mass Arbitration Rules, as may be appropriate in the context of the dispute and as modified by this Dispute Resolution Section. For a copy of the AAA Rules, please visit https://www.adr.org/Rules or contact AAA [email protected]. If AAA is unable or unwilling to perform its duties under this agreement, the Parties shall mutually agree on an alternative administrator that will replace AAA and assume AAA’s role consistent with this agreement. If the Parties are unable to agree, they will petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an administrator that will assume AAA’s duties under this agreement.\n\nThe Parties agree that the following procedures will apply to any Arbitrations initiated under this Dispute Resolution Section:\n\nCommencing an Arbitration - To initiate an arbitration, you or Built In shall send to AAA a demand for arbitration (\"Demand for Arbitration\") that describes the claim(s) and request for relief in detail, consistent with the requirements in this agreement and AAA Rules. If you send a Demand for Arbitration, you shall also send it to Built In at Built In, Inc., 222 Merchandise Mart Plaza Suite 2010, Chicago, Illinois 60654, within 10 days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration to AAA. If Built In sends a Demand for Arbitration, we will also send it to your mailing address on file with us within the same 10-day period. If your mailing address is unavailable, we will send it to your email address on file, or if no email address is on file, other contact information associated with your account. The arbitration provider shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration and shall administratively close any such demand for arbitration that fails to certify in writing that the Party meets the requirements of this Dispute Resolution Section or if either Party elects small claims court as set forth above.\n\nFees – The payment of all fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules, except to the extent that the case is a part of a Mass Filing (as defined below) or the AAA fees and costs (including Arbitrator fees) paid by either Party are reallocated upon order of the Arbitrator following a determination that (a) either Party breached Dispute Resolution section of this agreement, (b) such reallocation is called for under this agreement, or (c) reallocation is otherwise permitted under applicable law. Upon a showing to Built In of your financial hardship we will consider a good faith request made by you to pay your portion of the applicable consumer portion of the filing fee. Built In is committed to ensuring that arbitration costs to consumers do not serve as a barrier to the adjudication of disputes. If Built In initiates an arbitration against you, we shall pay all fees.\n\nThe Arbitrator – The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral (the \"Claim Arbitrator\"), as assisted by any Process Arbitrator appointed under AAA Rules. (The term \"Arbitrator\" applies to both the Claim Arbitrator and the Process Arbitrator). If a hearing is elected by either Party, the Arbitrator shall be in or close to the location in which you reside. The Arbitrator is bound by and shall adhere to this agreement. In the event AAA Rules conflict with this agreement, the terms of this agreement shall control. If the Arbitrator determines that strict application of any term of this Dispute Resolution section of this agreement (except for the small claims election, which shall be determined by the small claims court) would result in a fundamentally unfair arbitration (the \"Unfair Term\"), then the Arbitrator shall have authority to modify the Unfair Term to the extent necessary to ensure a fundamentally fair arbitration that is consistent with the Terms of Use (the \"Modified Term\"). In determining the substance of a Modified Term, the Arbitrator shall select a term that comes closest to expressing the intention of the Unfair Term.\n\nDispositive Motions– The Parties agree that the Claim Arbitrator shall have the authority to consider dispositive motions without an oral evidentiary hearing. Dispositive motions may be requested under the following circumstances: (a) within 30 days after the Claim Arbitrator’s appointment, a Party may request to file a dispositive motion based upon the pleadings; and (b) no later than 30 days prior to the evidentiary hearing, a Party may request to file a dispositive motion for summary judgment based upon the Parties’ pleadings and the evidence submitted.\n\nDiscovery – Each Party may (a) serve up to five requests for relevant, non-privileged documents from the other Party; and (b) request that the other Party provide verified responses to no more than 5 relevant interrogatories (including subparts). Unless both Parties agree otherwise, no other forms of discovery (including depositions) may be utilized. Any such discovery requests must be served on the other Party within 21 days after the Claim Arbitrator’s appointment. The responding Party shall provide the requesting Party with all responsive, non-privileged documents, responses signed by the Party themselves to the requested interrogatories, and/or any objections to the requests within 30 days after receipt of the requests, or, in the event of an objection to any discovery request, 30 days after the Claim Arbitrator resolves the dispute. In the event either Party requests that the Claim Arbitrator consider a dispositive motion on the pleadings, such written discovery response deadlines shall be extended until 30 days following the Claim Arbitrator’s final decision on such dispositive motion. Any disputes about discovery or requests for extensions shall be submitted promptly to the Claim Arbitrator for resolution. In ruling on any discovery dispute or extension request, the Claim Arbitrator shall take into consideration the nature, amount, and scope of the underlying arbitration claim, the cost and other effort that would be involved in providing the requested discovery, the case schedule, and whether the requested discovery is necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim or defense.\n\nConfidentiality – Upon either Party’s request, the Arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either Party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal.\n\nArbitration Hearing – You and Built In are entitled to a fair evidentiary hearing (i.e. trial) before the Claim Arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings are usually simpler, less costly, and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. The Parties agree to waive all oral hearings and instead submit all disputes to the Claim Arbitrator for an award based on written submissions and other evidence as the Parties may agree, unless a Party requests an oral hearing within 10 days after the Respondent files a response. If an oral evidentiary hearing is requested, both Parties must be personally present at the hearing, regardless of whether either Party has retained counsel. Both Parties must personally attend the hearing. Either Party’s failure to personally attend the hearing, without a continuance ordered by the Claim Arbitrator for good cause, will result in a default judgment taken against that Party.\n\nArbitration Award – Regardless of the format of the arbitration, the Claim Arbitrator shall provide a reasoned decision, in writing within 30 days after the hearing or, if no hearing is held, within 30 days after any rebuttal or supplemental statements are due. The decision must clearly specify the relief, if any, awarded and contain a brief statement of the reasons for the award. The arbitration award is binding only between you and Built In and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different Party. The Claim Arbitrator may, however, choose to consider rulings from other arbitrations involving a different Party. The Arbitrator may award fees and costs as provided by the AAA Rules or to the extent such fees and costs could be awarded in court. This includes but is not limited to the ability of the Arbitrator to award fees and costs if the Arbitrator determines that a claim or defense is frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose, for the purpose of harassment, or in bad faith.\n\nOffer of Settlement – The Respondent may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer to the opposing Party any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the Claim Arbitrator until after the Claim Arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the opposing Party’s favor and is less than the Respondent’s settlement offer or if the award is in the Respondent’s favor, the opposing Party must pay the Respondent’s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney’s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the flipping of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs that claimant may be entitled to for the cause of action under which it is suing.\n\nMass Filing – If, at any time, 25 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against Built In or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities (\"Mass Filing\"), consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings set forth in the AAA’s Mass Arbitration supplemental rules and procedures (\"AAA’s Mass Filing Rules\", available at https://www.adr.org/Rules), the additional protocols set forth below shall apply.\n\nIf you or your counsel file a Demand for Arbitration that fits within the definition of Mass Filing referred to above, then you agree that your Demand for Arbitration shall be subject to the additional protocols set forth in this Mass Filing subsection. You also acknowledge that the adjudication of your Dispute might be delayed and that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled from the time at which the first cases are chosen to proceed until your case is chosen for a bellwether proceeding.\n\nAAA’s Mass Filing Rules shall apply if your Dispute is deemed by AAA, in its sole discretion pursuant to its Rules and this Dispute Resolution Section, to be part of a Mass Filing. Such election for AAA’s Mass Filing Rules and related fee schedule must be made by either you or Built In in writing and submitted to AAA’s and all Parties.\n\nBellwether Proceedings. Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by courts and arbitration administrators when there are multiple disputes involving similar claims against the same or related parties. Counsel for the Mass Filings claimants (including you) and counsel for Built In shall each select 15 Demands for Arbitration (30 total), and no more than 30 arbitrations shall be filed, processed, adjudicated, or pending at the same time, with each of the 30 individual arbitrations presided over by a different Claim Arbitrator, in a first set of bellwether proceedings. During this time, no other Demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed, adjudicated, or pending. If the Parties are unable to resolve the remaining Demands for Arbitration after the first set of bellwether proceedings are arbitrated or otherwise resolved, then counsel for the Claimants and counsel for Built In shall each select an additional 15 Demands for Arbitration (30 total) to be filed, processed, and adjudicated as individual arbitrations, with each of the 30 arbitrations presided over by a different Claim Arbitrator, in a second set of bellwether proceedings. During this time, no other Demands for Arbitration that are part of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed, or adjudicated. This staged process of bellwether proceedings, with each set including 30 Demands for Arbitration adjudicated on an individual basis, shall continue until each Demand included in the Mass Filings (including your Demand for Arbitration) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Fees associated with a Demand for Arbitration included in the Mass Filings, including fees owed by Built In and the claimants (including you), shall only be due after your Demand for Arbitration is chosen as part of a set of bellwether proceedings and therefore properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication. Any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning when you initiate the informal dispute resolution process set forth in subsection 7.1, and if the first Mass Filings’ Demands for Arbitration are chosen for the initial set of bellwether proceedings have been filed, your claims will remain tolled until your Demand for Arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled. A court of competent jurisdiction located in a venue allowed under Section 8 of the agreement shall have the power to enforce this subsection.\n\nYou and Built In agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of the arbitration and small claims court process and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Built In acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the fair resolution of genuine and sincere Disputes. The Parties further agree that application of these Mass Filings procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.\n\n7.5 FUTURE CHANGES AND RETROACTIVE APPLICATION\n\nThis Dispute Resolution Section 7 applies to all Disputes between the Parties, including for any claims that accrued against you or Built In prior to the time of your consent to this agreement and to any claims that accrue against you or Built In after your consent to this agreement. Notwithstanding any provision in this agreement to the contrary, you may elect to opt out of the retroactive application of this Dispute Resolution Section 7 as to claims that have accrued against you or against Built In prior to the time of your consent to this agreement in accordance with the opt-out instructions below.\n\n7.6 ARBITRATION OPT-OUT PROCEDURE\n\nYou may opt-out of this Dispute Resolution Section 7by sending us written notice, within 30 days of the time you consent to this agreement, to the following email address: [email protected].

      "# [AI and Copyright Law: What We Know by Ellen Glover on 2023-04-19](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-copyright)\nAt the moment, works created solely by artificial intelligence — even if produced from a text prompt written by a human — are not protected by copyright.\n\nWhen it comes to training AI models, however, the use of copyrighted materials is fair game. That’s because of a fair use law that permits the use of copyrighted material under certain conditions without needing the permission of the owner. But pending lawsuits could change this.\n\nGenerative AI has significantly altered the way we live, work and create in a short amount of time. As a result, the deluge of AI-generated text, images and music — and the process used to create them — has prompted a series of complicated legal questions. And they are challenging our understanding of ownership, fairness and the very nature of creativity itself.\n\nRelated Reading4 Ethical Questions Generative AI Poses\n\nCan AI Art Be Copyrighted?\n\nIt has long been the posture of the U.S. Copyright Office that there is no copyright protection for works created by non-humans, including machines. Therefore, the product of a generative AI model cannot be copyrighted.\n\nThe root of this issue lies in the way generative AI systems are trained. Like most other machine learning models, they work by identifying and replicating patterns in data. So, in order to generate an output like a written sentence or picture, it must first learn from the real work of actual humans.\n\nIf an AI image generator produces art that resembles the work of Georgia O’Keefe, for example, that means it had to be trained using the actual art of Georgia O’Keefe. Similarly, for an AI content generator to write in the style of Toni Morrison, it has to be trained with words written by Toni Morrison.\n\nLegally, these AI systems — including image generators, AI music generators and chatbots like ChatGPT — cannot be considered the author of the material they produce. Their outputs are simply a culmination of human-made work, much of which has been scraped from the internet and is copyright-protected in one way or another.\n\nSo, how do we reconcile the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence industry with the knotty particulars of U.S. copyright law? That is something creatives, companies, courts and the United States government are trying to figure out.\n\nDive DeeperThe Unreal Slim Shady: How We Trained an AI to Simulate Eminem’s Style\n\nLines Get Blurry When Humans and AI Collaborate\n\nCreative work that is the result of a collaboration between a human and machine, which is often the case with AI-generated creations, is a complicated matter.\n\n“If a machine and a human work together, but you can separate what each of them has done, then [copyright] will only focus on the human part,” Daniel Gervais, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School, told Built In. He mainly focuses on intellectual property law, and has written extensively on how it relates to artificial intelligence.\n\nIf the human and machine’s contributions are more intertwined, a work’s eligibility for copyright depends on how much control or influence the human author had on the machine’s outputs. “It really needs to be an authorial kind of contribution,” Gervais said. “In that case, the fact that you worked with a machine would not exclude copyright protection.”\n\nZarya of the Dawn and Its Impact on U.S. Copyright Law\n\nThis threshold was put to the test in September of 2022, when the U.S. Copyright Office made history by granting the first known registration of a work produced with the help of text-to-image generator Midjourney — a graphic novel called Zarya of the Dawn. Written by Kristina Kashtanova, the 18-page narrative had all the trappings of a typical comic book — characters, dialogue and plenty of images, all of which were generated using Midjourney.\n\nJust a few months later, the office reconsidered its decision and wound up partially canceling the work’s copyright registration, claiming in a letter to Kashtanova’s attorney that it had “non-human authorship” that had not been taken into account. The book’s text, as well as the “selection, coordination, and arrangement” of its “written and visual elements,” remained protected. The images themselves did not, though, because they were “not the product of human authorship,” but rather of text prompts that generated unpredictable outputs based on its training data. The office also deemed whatever editing Kashtanova did to the images as “too minor and imperceptible to supply the necessary creativity for copyright protection.”\n\nThe office has since released a more sweeping policy change to address all AI-human creative collaborations moving forward — a response to what it sees as new trends in registration activity. The document essentially doubles down on its stance with Zarya of the Dawn, reiterating that the term “author” is not extended to non-humans, including machines. It also states that if a human simply types in a prompt and a machine generates complex written, visual or musical works in response, the “traditional elements of authorship” have been executed by AI, a non-human. Therefore, it is not protected by copyright.\n\nFederal courts have also affirmed the U.S. Copyright Office’s position that AI-created artwork cannot be copyrighted. In August 2023, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia sided with the agency against computer scientist Stephen Thaler, who was seeking copyright protection for an image created by AI software.\n\nLawsuits Surge in the Wake of Generative AI\n\nSome creators and companies believe their content has been stolen by generative AI companies, and are now seeking to strip these companies of the protective shield of fair use in a series of pending lawsuits.\n\nCompany Lawsuits\n\nGetty Images is suing Stability AI (the company behind Stable Diffusion) for copying and processing millions of images that are protected by copyright, as well as their associated metadata owned by Getty Images, without getting permission or providing compensation.\n\nTikTok settled a lawsuit in 2021 with voice actress Bev Standing, who claims the company used her voice without permission for its text-to-speech feature.\n\nThe New York Times joined the legal struggle as well near the end of 2023, suing Open AI and Microsoft for using millions of NYT articles to train AI models. According to NPR’s sources, if courts find that OpenAI illegally used Times articles to train its models, OpenAI could be forced to destroy its LLM dataset and rebuild it from scratch. Additional U.S. newspapers, including The New York Daily News and The Chicago Tribune, have sued Microsoft and Open AI, creating more legal headaches for the AI duo.\n\nMajor music publishers like Universal Music are targeting Anthropic, claiming the company illegally trained its chatbot Claude AI on copyrighted song lyrics. The publishers also called for greater “guardrails” to ensure Anthropic doesn’t copy song lyrics moving forward. Meanwhile, AI music startups Suno and Uncharted Labs are the center of another AI music lawsuit, led by record labels like Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group.\n\nClass-Action Lawsuits\n\nArtists Sarah Anderson, Kelly McKernan and Karla Ortiz have filed a class-action copyright infringement lawsuit against both Stability AI and Midjourney, both of which use Stable Diffusion to generate their images. The suit claims that these artists’ work was wrongfully used to train Stable Diffusion, and that the images generated in the style of those authors directly compete with their own work — an important point in the matter of fair use.\n\n“Until now, when a purchaser seeks a new image ‘in the style’ of a given artist, they must pay to commission or license an original image from that artist. Now, those purchasers can use the artist’s works contained in Stable Diffusion along with the artist’s name to generate new works in the artist’s style without compensating the artist at all,” the complaint reads. “The harm to artists is not hypothetical — works generated by AI image products ‘in the style’ of a particular artist are already sold on the internet, siphoning commissions from the artists themselves.”\n\nIn August 2024, U.S. District Judge William Orrick upheld all copyright infringement and trademark claims in the case. The lawsuit is set to move forward, providing an early victory for artists while dealing a blow to any AI company that uses Stable Diffusion.\n\nWriters have also tried to bring class-action lawsuits against top AI companies. Nonfiction writers Nicholas Basbanes and Nicholas Gage have sued OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming the companies “simply stole” content from their works and must compensate them. The pair of writers want to represent a class of writers that could number in the tens of thousands. This comes on the heels of fiction writers suing OpenAI and seeking to establish a class-action lawsuit in late 2023.\n\nQuestions Around Authorship and Competition\n\nThe U.S. Copyright Office’s stance on excluding machines from being considered authors could throw a wrench in the Stable Diffusion lawsuit and many others, according to Rob Heverly, an associate professor at Albany Law School who specializes in the intersection of technology and law.\n\n“In order for there to be infringement, there has to be an author. So, if there isn’t an author, I don’t know that there can be infringement,” Heverly told Built In. “If we’re not going to hold the technology maker liable for the technology itself, then the creator of the output is the AI. But we’ve already said they’re not an author. So if they’re not an author then they can’t create an infringing work.”\n\nAmid all these lawsuits against AI companies, the scope of fair use in generative AI may come down to a Supreme Court decision on a 1981 photograph of rock musician Prince and a re-creation of the photograph made by pop artist Andy Warhol a few years later. The Court ruled against Warhol, concluding the piece wasn’t transformative enough to be a new piece of art and was guilty of copyright infringement.\n\nA key factor in the Supreme Court’s ruling was the commercial usage of the altered photo and how it targeted the same market as that of the original photo. This could bleed over into the generative AI space as companies claim AI-generated content directly competes with the original content AI tools are trained on. Still, the fair use doctrine’s place in the ongoing legal saga of generative AI is up in the air as the courts continue to untangle a web of lawsuits.\n\nLooking AheadIs Generative AI the Next Tech Bubble?\n\nCreators and Companies Alike Take Action\n\nWhile generative AI hangs in legal limbo, creators are still worried about their work or style being used to train generators without permission or compensation.\n\n“The large majority of independent artists make their living through commissioned works,” Ben Zhao, a computer science professor at the University of Chicago, told Built In. But, the websites they post their work on are being scraped by AI models in order to learn and then mimic that particular style. “Artists are literally being replaced by models that have been trained on their own work.”\n\nTo help, Zhao and his team designed a new tool called Glaze. If an artist wants to put a creation online without the threat of an image generator copying their style, they can upload it to Glaze first and choose an art style different from their own. The software then makes mathematical changes to the artist’s work on a pixel level so it looks different to a computer, rendering it useless as an effective piece of training data.\n\nOther companies are taking a more offensive approach. Shutterstock, a stock imagery site that was “critical” to the training of OpenAI’s DALL-E, according to CEO Sam Altman, has gone so far as to pay content creators if their work is used to develop generative AI models.\n\nAnd Shutterstock isn’t alone. Generative AI startup Bria trains its models exclusively on what it calls “responsibly sourced” data sets, and it pays royalties to artists and stock image providers when their creations have been used to generate an image. “We pay back a royalty according to the output,” co-founder and CEO Yair Adato explained. “So if somebody generates a specific art in the style of the artist, then the artist will have the right to say how much money he wants on this synthetic creation. And then we will split the revenue.”\n\nThe Future of AI Copyright\n\nIf the use of creators’ work in generative AI models continues to go unchecked, many experts in this space believe it could spell big trouble — not only for the human creators themselves, but the technology too.\n\n“When these AI models start to hurt the very people who generate the data that it feeds on — the artists — it’s destroying its own future,” Zhao said. “So really, when you think about it, it is in the best interest of AI models and model creators to help preserve these industries. So that there is a sustainable cycle of creativity and improvement for the models.”\n\nApproaches to AI Copyright Laws\n\nIn the U.S., much of this preservation will be incumbent on the courts, where creators and companies are duking it out right now. Looking ahead, the level at which U.S. courts protect and measure human-made inputs in generative AI models could be reminiscent of what we’ve seen globally, particularly in other Western nations.\n\nThe United Kingdom is one of only a handful of countries to offer copyright protection for works generated solely by a computer. The European Union, which has a much more preemptive approach to legislation than the U.S., has crafted a sweeping AI Act that has taken effect and is set to address a lot of the concerns with generative AI.\n\nIf it is ultimately determined that AI companies have infringed on certain creators’ copyrighted work, it could mean a lot more lawsuits in the coming years — and a potentially expensive penalty for the companies at fault.\n\n“One thing you have to know about copyright law is, for infringement of one thing only — it could be a text, an image, a song — you can ask the court for $150,000,” Gervais said. “So imagine the people who are scraping millions and millions of works.”\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",
