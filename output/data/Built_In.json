      "# [Robotics: What Are Robots? Robotics Definition & Uses.](https://builtin.com/robotics)\nWhat Is Robotics?\n\nRobotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that produces machines, called robots, that replicate or substitute for human actions. Robots perform basic and repetitive tasks with greater efficiency and accuracy than humans, making them ideal for industries like manufacturing. However, the introduction of artificial intelligence in robotics has given robots the ability to handle increasingly complex situations in various industries.\n\nWhat Is a Robot?\n\nA robot is a programmable machine that can complete a task, while the term robotics describes the field of study focused on developing robots and automation. Each robot has a different level of autonomy. These levels range from human-controlled bots that carry out tasks to fully-autonomous bots that perform tasks without any external influences.\n\nIn terms of etymology, the word ‘robot’ is derived from the Czech word robota, which means “forced labor.” The word first appeared in the 1920 play R.U.R., in reference to the play’s characters who were mass-produced workers incapable of creative thinking.\n\nRobotics Aspects\n\nMechanical Construction\n\nThe mechanical aspect of a robot helps it complete tasks in the environment for which it’s designed. For example, the Mars 2020 Rover’s wheels are individually motorized and made of titanium tubing that help it firmly grip the harsh terrain of the red planet.\n\nElectrical Components\n\nRobots need electrical components that control and power the machinery. Essentially, an electric current — a battery, for example — is needed to power a large majority of robots.\n\nSoftware Program\n\nRobots contain at least some level of computer programming. Without a set of code telling it what to do, a robot would just be another piece of simple machinery. Inserting a program into a robot gives it the ability to know when and how to carry out a task.\n\nWhat Are the Main Components of a Robot?\n\nControl System\n\nComputation includes all of the components that make up a robot’s central processing unit, often referred to as its control system. Control systems are programmed to tell a robot how to utilize its specific components, similar in some ways to how the human brain sends signals throughout the body, in order to complete a specific task. These robotic tasks could comprise anything from minimally invasive surgery to assembly line packing.\n\nSensors\n\nSensors provide a robot with stimuli in the form of electrical signals that are processed by the controller and allow the robot to interact with the outside world. Common sensors found within robots include video cameras that function as eyes, photoresistors that react to light and microphones that operate like ears. These sensors allow the robot to capture its surroundings and process the most logical conclusion based on the current moment and allows the controller to relay commands to the additional components.\n\nActuators\n\nA device can only be considered to be a robot if it has a movable frame or body. Actuators are the components that are responsible for this movement. These components are made up of motors that receive signals from the control system and move in tandem to carry out the movement necessary to complete the assigned task. Actuators can be made of a variety of materials, such as metal or elastic, and are commonly operated by use of compressed air (pneumatic actuators) or oil (hydraulic actuators) but come in a variety of formats to best fulfill their specialized roles.\n\nPower Supply\n\nLike the human body requires food in order to function, robots require power. Stationary robots, such as those found in a factory, may run on AC power through a wall outlet but more commonly, robots operate via an internal battery. Most robots utilize lead-acid batteries for their safe qualities and long shelf life while others may utilize the more compact but also more expensive silver-cadmium variety. Safety, weight, replaceability and lifecycle are all important factors to consider when designing a robot’s power supply.\n\nSome potential power sources for future robotic development also include pneumatic power from compressed gasses, solar power, hydraulic power, flywheel energy storage organic garbage through anaerobic digestion and nuclear power.\n\nEnd Effectors\n\nEnd effectors are the physical, typically external components that allow robots to finish carrying out their tasks. Robots in factories often have interchangeable tools like paint sprayers and drills, surgical robots may be equipped with scalpels and other kinds of robots can be built with gripping claws or even hands for tasks like deliveries, packing, bomb diffusion and much more.\n\nHow Do Robots Work?\n\nSome robots are pre-programmed to perform specific functions, meaning they operate in a controlled environment where they do simple, monotonous tasks — like a mechanical arm on an automotive assembly line.\n\nOther robots are autonomous, operating independently of human operators to carry out tasks in open environments. In order to work, they use sensors to perceive the world around them, and then employ decision-making structures (usually a computer) to take the optimal next step based on their data and mission.\n\nRobots may also work by using wireless networks to enable human control from a safe distance. These teleoperated robots usually work in extreme geographical conditions, weather and circumstances. Examples of teleoperated robots are the human-controlled submarines used to fix underwater pipe leaks during the BP oil spill or drones used to detect landmines on a battlefield.\n\nTypes of Robotics\n\nHumanoid Robots\n\nHumanoid robots are robots that look like or mimic human behavior. These robots usually perform human-like activities (like running, jumping and carrying objects), and are sometimes designed to look like us, even having human faces and expressions. Two of the most prominent examples of humanoid robots are Hanson Robotics’ Sophia and Boston Dynamics’ Atlas.\n\nCobots\n\nCobots, or collaborative robots, are robots designed to work alongside humans. These robots prioritize safety by using sensors to remain aware of their surroundings, executing slow movements and ceasing actions when their movements are obstructed. Cobots typically perform simple tasks, freeing up humans to address more complex work.\n\nIndustrial Robots\n\nIndustrial robots automate processes in manufacturing environments like factories and warehouses. Possessing at least one robotic arm, these robots are made to handle heavy objects while moving with speed and precision. As a result, industrial robots often work in assembly lines to boost productivity.\n\nMedical Robots\n\nMedical robots assist healthcare professionals in various scenarios and support the physical and mental health of humans. These robots rely on AI and sensors to navigate healthcare facilities, interact with humans and execute precise movements. Some medical robots can even converse with humans, encouraging people’s social and emotional growth.\n\nAgricultural Robots\n\nAgricultural robots handle repetitive and labor-intensive tasks, allowing farmers to use their time and energy more efficiently. These robots also operate in greenhouses, where they monitor crops and help with harvests. Agricultural robots come in many forms, ranging from autonomous tractors to drones that collect data for farmers to analyze.\n\nMicrorobotics\n\nMicrorobotics is the study and development of robots on a miniature scale. Often no bigger than a millimeter, microrobots can vary in size, depending on the situation. Biotech researchers typically use microrobotics to monitor and treat diseases, with the goal of improving diagnostic tools and creating more targeted solutions.\n\nAugmenting Robots\n\nAugmenting robots, also known as VR robots, either enhance current human capabilities or replace the capabilities a human may have lost. The field of robotics for human augmentation is a field where science fiction could become reality very soon, with bots that have the ability to redefine the definition of humanity by making humans faster and stronger. Some examples of current augmenting robots are robotic prosthetic limbs or exoskeletons used to lift hefty weights.\n\nSoftware Bots\n\nSoftware bots, or simply ‘bots,’ are computer programs which carry out tasks autonomously. They are not technically considered robots. One common use case of software robots is a chatbot, which is a computer program that simulates conversation both online and over the phone and is often used in customer service scenarios. Chatbots can either be simple services that answer questions with an automated response or more complex digital assistants that learn from user information.\n\nRobotics Applications\n\nBeginning as a major boon for manufacturers, robotics has become a mainstay technology for a growing number of industries.\n\nManufacturing\n\nIndustrial robots can assemble products, sort items, perform welds and paint objects. They may even be used to fix and maintain other machines in a factory or warehouse.\n\nHealthcare\n\nMedical robots transport medical supplies, perform surgical procedures and offer emotional support to those going through rehabilitation.\n\nCompanionship\n\nSocial robots can support children with learning disabilities and act as a therapeutic tool for people with dementia. They also have business applications like providing in-person customer service in hotels and moving products around warehouses.\n\nHome Use\n\nConsumers may be most familiar with the Roomba and other robot vacuum cleaners. However, other home robots include lawn-mowing robots and personal robot assistants that can play music, engage with children and help with household chores.\n\nSearch and Rescue\n\nSearch and rescue robots can save those stuck in flood waters, deliver supplies to those stranded in remote areas and put out fires when conditions become too extreme for firefighters.\n\nPros and Cons of Robotics\n\nRobotics comes with a number of benefits and drawbacks.\n\nPros of Robotics\n\nIncreased accuracy. Robots can perform movements and actions with greater precision and accuracy than humans.\n\nEnhanced productivity. Robots can work at a faster pace than humans and don’t get tired, leading to more consistent and higher-volume production.\n\nImproved safety. Robots can take on tasks and operate in environments unsafe for humans, protecting workers from injuries.\n\nRapid innovation. Many robots are equipped with sensors and cameras that collect data, so teams can quickly refine processes.\n\nGreater cost-efficiency. Gains in productivity may make robots a more cost-efficient option for businesses compared to hiring more human workers.\n\nCons of Robotics\n\nJob losses. Robotic process automation may put human employees out of work, especially those who don’t have the skills to adapt to a changing workplace.\n\nLimited creativity. Robots may not react well to unexpected situations since they don’t have the same problem-solving skills as humans.\n\nData security risks. Robots can be hit with cyber attacks, potentially exposing large amounts of data if they’re connected to the Internet of Things.\n\nMaintenance costs. Robots can be expensive to repair and maintain, and faulty equipment can lead to disruptions in production and revenue losses.\n\nEnvironmental waste. Extracting raw materials to build robots and having to discard disposable parts can lead to more environmental waste and pollution.\n\nHistory of Robotics\n\nRobotics as a concept goes back to ancient times. The ancient Greeks combined automation and engineering to create the Antikythera, a handheld device that predicted eclipses. Centuries later, Leonardo Da Vinci designed a mechanical knight now known as “Leonardo’s Robot.” But it was the rise of manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution that highlighted the need for widespread automation.\n\nFollowing William Grey Walter’s development of the first autonomous robots in 1948, George Devol created the first industrial robotic arm known as Unimate. It began operating at a GM facility in 1959. In 1972, the Stanford Research Institute designed Shakey — the first AI-powered robot. Shakey used cameras and sensors to collect data from its surroundings and inform its next moves.\n\nThe ability of robots to perceive their surroundings led researchers to explore whether they could also perceive human emotions. In the late 1990s, MIT’s Dr. Cynthia Breazeal built Kismet, a robotic head that used facial features to express and respond to human emotions. This predecessor to social robots opened the door for future robots like Roomba and consumer-centric inventions like Alexa and other voice assistants.\n\nRobots took another leap forward in 2012 due to a breakthrough in deep learning. Armed with volumes of digital images, British AI expert Geoffrey Hinton and his team successfully trained a system of neural networks to sort over one million images while making few errors. Since then, companies have incorporated deep learning into their technologies, promising more possibilities for robotics.\n\n1700s\n\n(1737) Jacques de Vaucanson builds the first biomechanical automaton on record.

      "# [What Is Logistics? Logistics Definition and Examples.](https://builtin.com/logistics)\nWhat Is Logistics?\n\nLogistics is the process of coordinating how goods and products are obtained, stored and distributed. Manufacturers rely on logistics while overseeing complex operations in order to maintain efficiency, reduce costs and ensure that consumers’ needs are met.\n\nDue to the prominence of e-commerce companies, like Amazon, logistics embodies more than the actual movement of products from one place to another.\n\nLogistics Definition\n\nLogistics refers to the process of managing resources, including how they are transported, stored and received. Logistics often goes hand in hand with the global supply chain.\n\nAn important part of logistics is the steps taken in order to maximize customer satisfaction. This includes elements such as demand planning, order fulfillment, inventory management and customer service operations. These elements ensure that the goods consumers need are stocked and orders are fulfilled in a timely manner.\n\nLogistics management software has aided the expansion of what the logistics industry entails and how goods are brought to consumers. Some examples of software for the logistics industry include transportation management systems, enterprise resource planning software, yard management systems and warehouse management systems. The growth of this technology has created a need for specialized roles and companies focused on building and implementing logistics software.\n\nAs technology continues to transform our world, its influence on the logistics industry will only become greater, prompting a shift in how companies quickly and efficiently deliver their products to consumers.\n\nSupply Chain Management vs. Logistics\n\nSupply chain management and logistics are often thought of as one in the same, but the terms actually capture two distinct parts of what it means to move resources.\n\nSupply chain management is the larger network that connects global vendors, transportation companies, distributors and warehouses. This network functions as the framework that logistics works under.\n\nLogistics is the process companies undertake to deliver goods to consumers. This process involves purchasing and delivering materials, packaging and shipping goods as well as transporting goods and products to distributors.\n\nWhy Logistics Is Important\n\nLogistics may not be the first thing that comes to mind when a purchase is made online or in a brick-and-mortar store, but it is undeniably intertwined with everything we buy. Logistical considerations affect global supply chains, what items are in stock and when as well as where manufacturers chose to build their facilities. These influences are just one way that logistics displays importance in our global economy.\n\nUtilizing logistics properly is essential to the function of businesses across the globe — and effectively managed logistics typically leads to positive business outcomes. With the growing complexity of the global supply chain, properly implemented and managed logistics are more important than ever.\n\nThe importance of logistics also stretches to simplifying communication and reducing costs. Effective logistics help foster relationships between suppliers, shipping services and warehousers through automated systems. The connectivity of logistics improves delivery and fulfillment of orders, which in turn reduces overhead costs. Costs are also reduced by the ability to use logistical systems to purchase goods based on supply forecasts and improved inventory management.\n\nBest Logistics Companies Hiring for Open RolesView Top Logistics Companies Hiring Now\n\nTypes of Logistics\n\nThe logistics industry has transformed over the past century. During the 1960s, the supply chain was indelibly changed when IBM developed the world’s first computerized inventory management and forecasting system, which made it simpler to track orders, inventory and distribution. Since then, the industry has been propelled even further into the future, bringing with it an entirely new perspective on how we exchange goods across the globe.\n\nTypes of Logistics Companies\n\ne-Commerce logistics\n\nFreight logistics\n\nThird-party logistics\n\nCarrier logistics\n\nFreight forwarders\n\nToday, the logistics realm is heavily influenced by AI and machine learning, which many logistics companies use to offer more accurate forecasting and enhanced order management. With these technological advances and more, the supply chain has been given the chance to prosper worldwide.\n\nLogistics in e-Commerce\n\nGiven the rise of e-commerce and the rapid growth of the online ordering space, logistics has become one of the world’s fastest-growing industries. Many organizations have emerged in response to logistics’ continuous transformation, dedicated to optimizing the supply chain in unimaginable ways. Perhaps the most well-known logistics leader to have emerged over the past few decades is e-commerce giant Amazon. While Amazon was initially founded as an online marketplace for books, the company has become a household name across the globe, altering the way in which products are transported and delivered to consumers.\n\nAmazon has become famous for its logistics strategy, which is made possible by the company’s global network of distribution, sortation and fulfillment centers. Amazon’s same-day and next-day delivery model rests on a complex logistics framework. Products are delivered to the company’s fulfillment centers before being moved to sortation centers. Once goods have made it through Amazon’s sortation centers, they are loaded onto a wide range of transportation modes, which can include the company’s own fleet of delivery trucks and airplanes.\n\nThird-Party Logistics\n\nAmazon has entirely redefined the logistics landscape, yet it’s not the only major third party logistics (3PL) provider making waves. Companies like UPS and FedEx have played a significant role in the transformation of logistics. These companies are capable of transporting goods from their point of origin, warehousing products and packaging them. Working with 3PL providers offers numerous advantages for both small and large businesses including the ability to obtain better rates, easily expand into new markets and improve customer service.\n\nLogistics in Freight Shipping\n\nWhile 3PL providers are capable of handling the entirety of a company’s supply chain operations, the different components of the logistics process can be carried out by individual players. For instance, freight companies solely handle the physical transportation of goods, while freight forwarders are dedicated to optimizing transport solutions and handling necessary documentation. In this sense, logistics could be seen as a complex web of moving parts, which operate in tandem with one another in order to boost efficiency and reduce costs within the supply chain.\n\nBy way of example, Flexport has developed an operating model designed to simplify global freight forwarding, while Transfix has created a marketplace that connects shippers with a national network of carriers.\n\nRead NextFragmented Tech Is the Way Forward in Hospitality\n\nLogistic Tech Developments\n\nGiven the logistics industry’s seemingly endless transformation, logistics management is naturally made up of many different elements. These components include the planning, procurement and coordination of manufacturing materials, strategizing the development of a product and reclaiming materials and supplies involved in the manufacturing of a product. For logistics managers, keeping track of the many different aspects of a supply chain can be nearly impossible. Luckily, logistics tech has successfully reshaped the industry, turning it into a robust sector fueled by the rise of innovative new technologies.\n\nTop Logistics Tech Companies\n\nFourKites\n\nproject44\n\nMotive\n\nZipline\n\nFlexport\n\nTransfix\n\nArrive Logistics\n\nAI and Optimization in Logistics\n\nAs the demand for online delivery grows and consumers’ expectations become larger, the need to optimize logistics has never been greater. As a result, software developers have set to work creating platforms designed to make the supply chain more manageable. Real-time visibility software providers such as FourKites, project44 and FreightVerify empower supply chain operators to simply identify issues and quickly resolve them, saving organizations huge amounts of time during which they can focus on other aspects of the logistics process. Likewise, fleet management company Motive has made it easier to track cargo and drivers while improving efficiency and safety along the supply chain.\n\nConsidering all of the work that goes into Amazon’s e-commerce services, it may come as no surprise that the company relies heavily on the latest technology in order to accomplish its consumer delivery goals. Amazon has been using AI to power its product recommendations for years. The company has also adopted machine learning to build the handheld virtual assistant, Amazon Echo.\n\nWarehouse Automation in Logistics\n\nAmazon doesn’t solely use technology to maximize the customer experience. In fact, the company’s technological expertise extends to its packaging and delivery services. The e-commerce company made headlines in 2012 when it introduced automation into its supply chain upon acquiring Kiva Systems. Today, Amazon’s warehouses are filled with thousands of robots built to optimize the picking and packing process.\n\nAmazon isn’t the only logistics leader that has unlocked the potential of robotics. In fact, the warehouse automation space has grown tremendously over the past several years and is expected to become increasingly more valuable over time. The growth of this sector is attributed largely to the steady rise of e-commerce, which has ignited the need to send products out quickly while lowering operating costs. The popularity of online grocery shopping in particular has bolstered the growth of warehouse automation, as online grocery retailers have been forced to meet consumers’ ever-increasing demands while competing with brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles in Logistics\n\nAs warehouse automation continues to infiltrate the logistics industry, autonomous vehicles are becoming a supply chain essential. For companies like Amazon, self-driving vehicles are not only profitable within the warehouse, as they harbor the potential to make on-road delivery faster and more efficient. Companies like Starship Technologies are developing revolutionary new ways to autonomously transport goods, thus unleashing new possibilities within the logistics realm.\n\nDrones in Logistics\n\nAlongside the emergence of autonomous vehicles, the commercial use of drones has opened up new avenues for supply chain management. Within a warehouse setting, drones can be used for aerial inspection and can even carry out maintenance requests, all of which can save manufacturers vast amounts of time.\n\nGiven drones’ ability to quickly transport small items, many tech companies are trying their hand at developing aerial transportation modes. For instance, logistics startup Zipline has created unmanned drones designed to quickly deliver goods, reduce emissions and integrate with existing operations.\n\n3D Printing in Logistics\n\nWhile there are many options when it comes to packaging and delivering goods quickly, supply chain experts are still searching for ways to manufacture products at a speed that meet consumers’ growing expectations. For this reason, 3D printing has entered the logistics space as a possible solution. The process of gathering supplies and producing a product often requires the most time and effort within the supply chain setting.\n\nIf 3D printing were applied to the production process, consumers would have greater control over the supply chain. Potentially, a consumer could place an order for a product and then a local 3D printer shop would quickly create the product before sending it out for delivery. 3D printing could ultimately disrupt the logistics industry, as it offers manufacturers the opportunity to produce complex and customized goods faster than ever before.",

      "# [What Is Wearable Technology? Examples of Wearables](https://builtin.com/wearables)\nWhat Is Wearable Technology?\n\nIt seems like everything nowadays is a smart device. Smart toasters. Smart dog collars. Smart homes. In the age of smart, there is nothing more intelligent or more innovative than the devices being produced by the wearables industry.\n\nWearable devices help collect and analyze real-time personal data that informs us on everything from our health to our workouts. They’ve become extremely popular tools to help us stay informed and in touch with ourselves to the point that almost a quarter of people in the U.S. now sport a wearable device.\n\nWhat Are Wearables?\n\nWearables make up a broad category that includes any device worn or attached to a user’s body. Smart watches, VR headsets and wearable electrocardiograms are a few examples. These devices support purposes related to areas like health and fitness, entertainment and everyday use.\n\nWhat exactly is a wearable? Wearables are electronic devices that are worn on a person — usually close to the skin — in order to accurately relay important medical, biological and exercise data to a database.\n\nWearables have helped make the IoT industry the $594 billion dollar behemoth it is today (the wearables industry itself is expected to balloon to $111 billion by 2027). Apple Watches and Fitbits are classic examples of wearable technology, but those aren’t the only devices being developed today. In addition to smart watches, VR and AR technology, smart jackets and a wide variety of other gadgets are leading us towards a better-connected lifestyle. Each device’s main job is to collect millions of data points that range from how many steps you take to your heart rate.\n\nBenefits of Wearables\n\nThe advancement of wearables has been a welcomed tool for the insurance, healthcare and sports industries for a number of reasons. From encouraging healthier habits to optimizing physical performance, industries have reaped numerous rewards that come with wearable tech.\n\nWearables Improve Healthcare\n\nThe healthcare industry is probably seeing the biggest benefit from wearable technology. Patients who wear these smart devices can measure information ranging from body temperature to blood pressure, which is then relayed to their medical team in real-time. If something looks off, doctors have a quicker way to accurately diagnose and treat a patient. The entire treatment process is now quicker thanks to the data collected by a wearable device because doctors no longer have to run a gamut of tests to determine an illness or disease. They can reference the data collected by a wearable to quickly figure out the cause of the medical mishap.\n\nBest Wearables Companies Hiring NowView the Top Wearables Companies With Open Jobs\n\nWearables Provide More Insights Into Sports and Fitness Performance\n\nHaving all of this health data in real-time is, of course, helping the sports and fitness industries push the boundaries of training. Professional athletes from all over the world maximize their training regimes thanks to the biometric data captured through wearable technology. Elite athletes, from marathon runners to the Golden State Warriors and Liverpool FC, are using smart compression shirts to maximize every move an athlete makes. These smart shirts use a combination of GPS, accelerometers and biomedical sensors to constantly measure the performance of each athlete. Is Liverpool superstar Mo Salah taking the optimal route to a ball? Is NBA all-star Steph Curry maximizing his hydration levels to perform at his peak ability? How can MLB players, like Mike Trout or Kris Bryant, maximize their acceleration out of the batter’s box? Wearable technology is the key to answering these questions and unlocking the optimal potential of world-class athletes.\n\nWearables Increase the Productivity and Health of Workforces\n\nThe business world has benefited from the introduction of wearables to its workforce. Seventy-nine percent of employees who wear a smart device in the office report that the devices are instrumental to their work. Equipping a workforce with wearable devices makes sense for employers. These devices enhance communication, track employee activity, boost job site safety measures and can actually improve the health and quality of life for a workforce. A healthier, happier workforce will then lead to higher rates of employee retention, saving companies thousands, if not millions, of dollars annually.\n\nExamples of Wearable Technologies\n\nHealth and Fitness Wearables\n\nWearables are often associated with the health and wellness sectors. Smart watches, like a Fitbit or Apple Watch, have pioneered the way we track everything from heart rates to our daily steps. Constantly checking in with them has become part of a daily routine for many.\n\nThese watches inherently encourage healthier lifestyles because of the data they collect. Knowing how far you run encourages you to push yourself further to beat your old record. Seeing that you’re almost to your daily 10,000-step goal encourages you to go for a walk around the block. Even tracking your current sleep habits could lead to changes that help you sleep more soundly at night. In a sense, wearable tech is one of the best ways to gamify the health and wellness journey.\n\nLife Insurance Wearables\n\nIn order to promote healthier lifestyles, life insurance companies issue wearables to their customers, who then track their health data. Devices like smart watches and fitness trackers provide details on someone’s activity levels, heart rate and other important health data points. The data collected informs premium prices and can paint a more accurate picture about the overall health of life insurance customers. It’s a much more concrete method rather than relying on a vague metric, such as one’s age, when creating an individual policy.\n\nGaming Wearables\n\nGaming is one of the biggest frontiers for wearable technology. Virtual reality (VR) headsets are the most common form of wearable devices in the industry. VR headsets, like the Oculus Rift or the Playstation VR, instantly immerse gamers in other-worldly experiences from the second they strap in. Do you want to know how it would feel to fight with Lightsabers? Maybe you really want to live out your adrenaline junky dreams of racing in the Indianapolis 500? VR wearables are bringing awe-inspiring experiences like these to gamers all over the world.\n\nWearable technologies taking off in the gaming industry are haptic devices. These smart wearables provide tactile feedback to a gamer in real time. This means that a device takes advantage of a gamer’s sense of touch by providing force or vibrations to a user. To put it simply, haptic vests, gloves or suits make gaming more realistic — a gamer can now feel actual recoil after shooting their virtual weapon or can even experience real feedback of what it feels like to dribble a virtual basketball. Though still in its infancy, haptic technology is poised to make the future of gaming, and wearables, more entertaining and realistic.\n\nFashion Wearables\n\nIt only makes sense that wearable tech has started to permeate fashion culture. Athletes wear full-body suits, equipped with hundreds of little IoT sensors, to measure their every move. The data gathered will help them to better optimize their swing, shot or kick. The consumer wearable technology clothing industry is still relatively new, albeit already intriguing. Smart jackets are being made to automatically cool or warm the body based on body temperatures taken from sensors throughout the jacket. Smart rings are giving people a stylish way to track their steps or measure their sleep habits. Our pants might one day become smart enough to use the thermal energy our bodies naturally produce to charge our cell phones. Wearable devices in fashion demonstrate that tech can be smart and sophisticated all at once.\n\nTravel Wearables\n\nThe ability of smart wearables to immerse users in virtual environments has made them a vital tool for the travel industry. With VR technology, companies can provide in-depth virtual tours of hotel rooms, local landmarks and other potential destinations. People can then make more informed decisions about where they choose to stay and visit, resulting in a higher-quality travel experience for customers.\n\nMany airlines also cater to wearable devices, allowing customers to store tickets and boarding passes in a digital wallet like Apple Wallet. If someone is wearing a smart watch, they can pull up any necessary passes for a faster entry and boarding process.\n\nEducation Wearables\n\nEducation has had to adapt to the digital age, and wearable tech has helped the industry catch up with the latest developments. Smart glasses and VR headsets enable organizations to train students and employees through simulations and virtual environments. Users are immersed in a real-life scenario, allowing them to spend more time learning by doing rather than listening to a lecture or presentation.\n\nIn addition, brain sensor headbands track when someone’s mind is stressed and relaxed. Educators can leverage this device to learn when students are pushing their minds too much and teach them how to remain calm while taking in new experiences and knowledge.\n\nLogistics Wearables\n\nAnother beneficiary of wearables is the logistics industry, which relies on wearable tech to develop more efficient operations. Smart glasses like Google Glass enable warehouse workers to quickly scan barcodes, pull up information from a database and make updates along the way. This process eliminates the need for workers to keep going back to a physical computer, saving them time as they organize packages and items.\n\nSome VR glasses go as far as to help workers determine their location in a large warehouse, mapping out the optimal route to travel between two points. These glasses can also reveal the best ways to organize packages for maximized storage without crushing lighter items. All these abilities make wearable devices a must-have for logistics companies.",
      "# [A Look Into the Gaming Industry: Types of Video Games and Gaming Jobs](https://builtin.com/gaming)\nGaming Industry Overview\n\nThe gaming industry, a current $200 billion behemoth, is arguably one of the most important and innovative sectors in tech today. Its importance to culture, social networking and entertainment cannot be understated. The term “entertainment industry” is no longer reserved for Hollywood and the movie industry because gaming is now providing one of the most immersive and awe-inspiring forms of entertainment to more than three billion people around the globe.\n\nNobody could imagine what the gaming industry would blossom into when they were messing around with Pong joysticks in their basements and competing against their friends for the highest Pac-Man scores in the 1970s and ‘80s. These simple games would turn out to be the bedrock of today’s gaming industry and instant cultural phenomena.\n\nPioneered by evergrowing gaming companies, the current gaming industry is pushing the boundaries of technology to create cutting-edge and highly immersive entertainment experiences. Not only do we have the continuous advent of new consoles, PCs and devices that are putting us right into the game, but we also have the opportunity to watch some of the best gamers in the world compete in the esports arena and online through streaming platforms like Twitch and Mixer.\n\nGaming Platforms\n\nThe gaming wars of today are just heating up. The battle over console gaming is being waged by Microsoft (Xbox), Sony (Playstation) and Nintendo (Switch). These platforms are pushing the absolute boundaries of technology by offering gamers state-of-the-art graphics, speeds and processing powers.\n\nTraditional console makers, like Microsoft, will likely have to compete with cloud gaming platforms whose games available to those anywhere with any decent internet connection. Even Netflix is getting in on the gaming action. Additionally, PC gaming has opened up a world of opportunities for gamers who are looking for extra ease-of-use and dexterity when casually playing (or competing in) their favorite games.\n\nBest Gaming Companies With Open JobsView Top Gaming Companies Hiring Now\n\nEsports\n\nPicture your favorite sport. All sports, whether it’s soccer, basketball or baseball, have many things in common: passionate fans, sold-out stadiums, engaging commentators and world-class athletes. The same thing is true in the world of esports. esports athletes are essentially the Michael Jordans of their profession, but instead of dunking on opponents on a court, they’re outwitting, outmaneuvering and outplaying their opponents in virtual worlds. Thousands of screaming fans pack the arena to root on their teams who are sitting on stage clicking away for a chance at a title, while millions more watch online around the world.\n\nBy 2025, esports is projected to garner more than 640 million viewers worldwide, with about 318 million of those viewers specifically falling into the category of esports enthusiasts. With a growing fanbase that may rival any professional sport on earth, it’s no wonder that cultural icons and savvy investors, like basketball legend Michael Jordan, rapper Drake and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, all own at least partial stakes in esports teams.\n\nVideo Game Streaming\n\nStreaming has also been a massive success for the gaming industry and gamers alike. Platforms that support streaming like Twitch and Youtube Gaming give individual gamers the opportunity to livestream their in-game play to subscribers all over the world.\n\nThis innovation has allowed millions of streamers to gain a fanbase, interact with one another and monetize their gaming skills. Streaming has become uber-popular to the point where Twitch alone, the most-watched game streaming platform, garnered almost 1.5 billion minutes of watchtime in 2021. Breakout successes in the streaming industry, like Tyler “Ninja” Blevins, have been able to make upwards of $10 million a year just through the fans and endorsement deals that come with running a popular streaming profile.\n\nThe meteoric rise of the gaming industry is just getting started. Born from humble beginnings, today’s gaming sector is ready to take on any other in tech for the title of the most innovative industry. What makes gaming so special is that it’s not only immersive and entertaining, but it’s inclusive and expansive as well. There is a game and a way to play for almost every human, which makes gaming one of the most beloved industries in the world.\n\nGaming Equipment and Technology\n\nConsole Gaming\n\nConsole gaming is the original (and probably most well-known) form of digital gaming. In the early days, Nintendo and Sega dominated the market for consoles. Today, Xbox and Playstation have become the two most popular consoles, offering millions of players the ability to experience the latest in gaming technology.\n\nConsoles have been a good indicator of the tech market as a whole. In the beginning, consoles were simple joysticks just technologically-ept enough to run simple games like Pong. Now, consoles, like the new Xbox Series X, have specially designed microchips that process images and power as efficiently as possible, all the while, being designed for 8K television screens. Gaming consoles are truly pushing the limits of consumer entertainment technology.\n\nPC Gaming\n\nPCs have had a meteoric rise in gameplay with almost 1.8 billion people using computers as their gaming tool of choice by the end of 2022. Gaming computers are all about efficiency. Gaming PCs have their own dedicated RAM space, GPUs and cooling systems that help to efficiently run games in real-time. These bulked-up computers can handle graphically demanding games and can even make it easier for streamers who need a reliable system to manage gaming at a high level and livestreaming their gameplay at the same time. Games like Fortnite, League of Legends and Minecraft have made gaming one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world today.\n\nQuantum computing is a sector to look out for when it comes to gaming. Still in its infancy, quantum computing has the ability to completely upend the gaming industry (and world) as we know it. These computers dwarf anything that computers can do now, and this technology is primed to make an impact in the gaming industry. Because quantum computers have unfathomable amounts of power and information storage, they’re able to render the best graphics imaginable in real time. These computers also fix a huge problem currently plaguing the gaming industry; predictability. Who wants to play a game where they know exactly what happens? A quantum computer’s massive storage of algorithms could actually make gaming unpredictable and unique for each gamer.\n\nBest E-Sports Companies With Open RolesView Top E-Sports Companies Hiring Now\n\nCloud Gaming\n\nCloud gaming is the newest type of video game technology making headlines. Imagine Netflix, but for gaming. You scroll through a library of games, choose which game you want and automatically start playing the game. No discs and no load times. Play on your phone, iPad or console. Cloud-based gaming platforms aim to make the whole gaming experience seamless and easy to play from anywhere at any time.\n\nCloud gaming is such a threat to traditional console gaming that Microsoft’s head of gaming, Phil Spencer, stated that Xbox is no longer concerned about competition from Nintendo or Playstation in 2020. Rather, they’re more focused on competing with the ultra-fast cloud platforms being hosted by companies like Amazon and Google. It is worth noting, however, that Google’s cloud-based gaming platform, Stadia, is shutting down in 2023.\n\nVR/AR Gaming\n\nVirtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are meant to put you right in the middle of the action. Instead of playing from a third person point-of-view, VR drops people into computer-generated environments to make them feel like they’re actually part of the game. VR offers gamers the ability to step into magical worlds and do everything from kick around a soccer ball to fight off hordes of monsters (like in the video above). Additionally, being directly a part of these kinds of digital worlds has made the draw to the metaverse that more appealing.\n\nAugmented reality, on-the-other-hand, adds digital influences to real life. A popular example of AR in gaming is the mobile game Pokémon Go, in which smartphone cameras are used to find and capture virtual creatures in the real world. Gamers might come across a Pikachu in the park or even find a Wartortle on their walk to work.\n\nWhether our reality is augmented or virtual, it’s clear to see that technology is ushering in a completely new way to participate in, and enjoy, video games.\n\nMobile Gaming\n\nMobile gaming makes up about 45 percent of the total market share of the gaming industry with over half of the worldwide population projected to play a mobile game by 2027.\n\nWhy is mobile gaming so popular? It’s easily accessible and has games for every type of gamer. Instead of having to strap on a headset or pop a disc into a console, mobile gaming allows us to play wherever we go and whenever we want. In 2020, it took over television as the preferred choice of leisure activity with people spending more than 6.5 hours per week on mobile games.\n\nThe mobile gaming industry is poised for continual growth as investments in mobile gaming startups have skyrocketed, and creativity opens up avenues for more gamers to enjoy different types of exciting games.\n\nMore On GamingWhat Does the Future of Gaming Look Like?\n\nPopular Gaming Jobs\n\nTypes of Gaming Jobs\n\nVideo game designer\n\nVideo game programmer\n\nVideo game animator\n\nVideo game quality assurance (QA) tester\n\nVideo Game Designer\n\nThat incredibly intricate, expansive and beautifully designed game you’re playing didn’t just appear out of thin air. It took a team of extraordinarily talented video game designers months, even years, to create all the dimensions that a user encounters when playing a game. These designers go through several prototypes of the game before rendering the final, customer-facing version. This requires an ability to be focused and resilient, as well as, an extensive background knowledge of game design techniques, tools and skills.\n\nGame design, especially at the highest level, usually requires a bachelor’s or master’s degree with a vast knowledge in everything from 3D animation to graphic design and even physics. The job outlook for game design looks really steady because of the enormous rise in console, PC and mobile gaming. Cities like Los angeles, New York and Chicago employ the most designers, and a video game designer can make an average of $42,900 a year.\n\nMore On Game Design18 Video Game Design Courses to Know\n\nVideo Game Programmer\n\nVideo game programmers are some of the most sought-after individuals in the gaming industry. They’re the people who bring a designer’s work to life through code. A good video game would be nothing without the hard work of a programmer, who ensures that characters, missions and environments are supposed to interact the way they were intended. Most game programmers usually have at least a bachelor’s degree, but all need a vast competence of C++ (and other languages) in order to thrive.\n\nGaming’s popularity has caused a boom in industry hiring for programmers and it’s not projected to slow down. Job growth isn’t the only positive aspect about being a game programmer. The salary is too.\n\nThe median salary for software developers, which can encompass computer programming and digital design, is more than $109,000 annually. This puts programmers up there with some of the most well-paid positions in the U.S.\n\nVideo Game Animator\n\nYou can’t have a high quality game without video game animators. Game animators combine technology and art to create the interactive images and sequences that help tell the story of the game. Animators work closely with designers and programmers to make sure that a game’s environment interacts in a way that is natural, fun and helps to progress the game. Animators start every project with a basic storyboard, then help bring that story to life through a series of intricate animations. Animators usually have an extensive background in multimedia knowledge, as well as a degree in a field like computer graphics or animation.\n\nThe video game animation field is projected to grow by about 16 percent until 2030, meaning animators can expect to see a healthy salary. On a median salary, animators can expect a value of around $79,000.\n\nVideo Game Testing and Quality Assurance (QA)\n\nGetting paid to play video games might be the ultimate dream job. Luckily, video game testers (better known as video game quality assurance testers) get paid to play, but more importantly, break, video games. Game QA testers push the work of designers, programmers and animators to the limits to ensure that games are free of bugs and allow for gamers to have the freedom to explore in these virtual environments. Testers usually run through what is called matrix testing, where they have to test every permutation and combination of events that could possibly happen in a game to ensure that nothing can break it.\n\nThere are really no essential educational credentials to have when it comes to QA testing video games. However, these testers need to have an eye for details, a tolerance for repetition and an intense passion for the gaming industry. Video game testers are in demand right now (especially in mobile gaming) due to the rapid increase of games being produced. Game and QA testers on average make around $55,000 annually.",
      "# [What Is Marketing? Basics of Marketing & Types](https://builtin.com/marketing)\nWhat Is Marketing?\n\nMarketing is one of, if not the, most important aspects of a business. What good is selling a life-changing product if customers have never heard of it and don’t know anything about it? That’s where capable marketers come in handy. Marketers help companies identify consumer and industry trends, formulate campaigns and captivate audiences by showing how their products shine over others.\n\nWhat, exactly, is marketing? Simply put, marketing is the activity of getting people aware of and interested in a brand and its products, often by promoting its offerings so that customers perceive them as valuable or desirable.\n\nWhat Do Marketers Do?\n\nMarketing is the process of designing, positioning, promoting and distributing a product or service in such a way that consumers see value in it. The role of marketers is often to increase brand awareness and loyalty, attract new customers and retain existing ones, ultimately driving more sales revenue for their company.\n\nWhether we’re conscious of it or not, marketing is all around us. Billboards along a highway, commercials on TV, advertisements in magazines, brand posts on social media and optimized content on a website are all everyday examples of marketing.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of marketing is Nike’s slogan “Just Do It.” Pairing “Just Do It” with world-class athlete spokespeople has proven to be one of the most effective marketing campaigns of the last 30 years. The phrase resonates with competitive athletes and fosters a sense of pushing yourself to be a better athlete (in your Nike gear, of course).\n\nOne of the reasons why marketing is so heavily emphasized is that it often helps inform other aspects of the business. Product, sales and advertising teams are all affected by the efforts of a marketing team. Marketers are responsible for guiding the decisions of these teams with valuable insights, so they compile data in the form of market research.\n\nMarket research entails gathering information about a business’ key demographics, their affinity toward a company’s current products and what other competitors are doing. A marketing team’s in-depth market research informs product and engineering teams on what to create, sales teams on what to sell and advertising teams on what to communicate.\n\nWhy Is Marketing Important?\n\nMarketing is a core component of business success because it impacts a company’s ability to reach customers, develop a brand and generate revenue.\n\nBenefits of Marketing\n\nEstablish a customer base\n\nDevelop a trustworthy brand\n\nAdd value to company products\n\nGenerate higher sales profits\n\nMarketing serves as a lifeline that connects brands to potential customers. Market research enables teams to determine who their target audience is and tailor their messaging and communications accordingly. Businesses can then generate positive perception within consumers who are most likely to find value in and buy their products.\n\nOver time, a well-planned marketing strategy solidifies a company’s brand and messaging. This is crucial because consistent branding tells consumers what to expect from a company and leads to a reputation. If a business can continue to meet these expectations and live up to its reputation, it can create trust among loyal customers and add value to its brand in the eyes of consumers.\n\nThe ultimate reward for these efforts is higher sales, and some of the most effective brands have become synonymous with winning and success. For example, many customers will pay more for a Nike shoe than an anonymous brand’s shoe based on the reputation of the Nike brand alone. An ideal brand highlights what makes a company unique, setting it apart from competitors and transforming its products into coveted items among consumers.\n\nThe 4 Ps of Marketing\n\nThe 4 Ps of marketing is a popular framework for understanding the areas involved in marketing strategy. Sometimes known as the marketing mix, the four Ps of marketing — product, price, place and promotion — are vital to every good marketing campaign.\n\n1. Product\n\nProduct is the good or service that the company is offering. Quality products should be able to satisfy customer needs, while also being able to satisfy customer demand. To effectively market a product, marketers need to pinpoint the value it brings to the customer and why customers would want it. The marketing team can start working on campaigns once these, and many other, questions are answered.\n\n2. Price\n\nPrice is obviously a large factor into whether a consumer buys your product or goes to a competitor. Good marketing teams rely on industry research to appropriately price their products so they boost their market share and reach more happy customers.\n\n3. Place\n\nIt’s critical that marketing professionals take place — both digital and physical — into account when marketing a product. Is a certain product more marketable in-store or online? Should you sell a certain product internationally? How do you market to certain geographical locations? How much does a location’s culture affect your marketing abilities? Marketing teams need to be hyper-aware of where they’re marketing to truly optimize their efforts.\n\n4. Promotion\n\nWhat good is a marketing effort if there isn’t some excitement and build-up around a product? Promotion includes the advertising, promotional strategy and public relations surrounding a product. “Should we create a commercial?” “Should we sponsor a podcast?” “Should we just run a Google Adwords campaign?” With some help from market research, marketing executives should be able to know when to target their audience and through which medium. Executing the promotion step of the marketing mix is vital because it helps to build fervor for a product and brand awareness.\n\nTypes of Marketing\n\nMarketing isn’t just a one-size-fits-all effort. There are different types of marketing campaigns depending on where an organization’s customers spend their time and how they prefer to be reached. Below are eight popular types of marketing:\n\nTypes of Digital Marketing\n\nSocial Media Marketing\n\nSocial media marketing involves the use of social media channels (like Instagram, Twitter and YouTube) to build a brand, connect with customers, drive website traffic and increase sales. These platforms have proven to be excellent marketing tools because they have the ability to educate customers on products, individualize consumer social media experiences and engage with an audience in a way that wasn’t possible before. Marketers rely on data analytics tools to develop targeted ads and timely posts that increase social media engagement with brands and boost revenue.\n\nContent Marketing\n\nContent marketing focuses on creating relevant, interesting and valuable content that attracts an audience and converts them into customers. Marketers are turning to this form of content because it boosts SEO traffic and increases both the quantity and quality of customers. A clever content marketing example is Coca Cola’s “Share a Coke” campaign. The company labeled its iconic bottles and cans with popular names to build stronger bonds with customers. The experiment was such a resounding success in Australia that it ended up being implemented in 80 countries worldwide.\n\nInfluencer Marketing\n\nInfluencer marketing is a type of social media marketing that relies on the virality and popularity of social media influencers, who are paid to promote and endorse products. Essentially, companies pay social media accounts with a large following to include their product in an Instagram, Snapchat or even Facebook post. Influencer marketing has proven profitable for both the company and the influencer. The company potentially gets millions of views of their product and the influencer gets paid. For example, to reach Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s 340 million Instagram followers, companies need to pay about $1 million per post.\n\nSEO Marketing\n\nHave you ever wondered how a search engine picks its search results for your specific query? How does it know what to choose at the top option? Much of that has to do with search engine optimization (SEO). SEO is the practice of increasing unpaid (known as organic) traffic through a variety of technical and content-related practices that make it easier for a search engine to read, understand and rank a site. Optimizing a site’s content, photos or backend procedures provides an uncluttered and efficient experience for both a user and a search engine, resulting in higher rankings. The higher rankings provided by this free method of marketing boosts traffic and converts a casual audience into loyal customers.\n\nTypes of Traditional Marketing\n\nPrint Marketing\n\nPrint marketing involves marketers reaching out to target audiences through offline formats. Brochures, informative flyers and mail advertisements are a few examples of print marketing that marketers hand out or deliver to the homes of consumers. Businesses may also try to reach wider audiences by placing ads in magazines, newspapers and other publications. While marketing teams focus on producing concise written content, they must also determine how to pair text with visuals. The most effective print marketing materials complement engaging writing with relevant images, branded color schemes and other eye-catching elements.\n\nBillboard Marketing\n\nBillboard marketing is another way to expose more consumers to a brand and features content on larger physical surfaces. Consumers can find these kinds of advertisements in crowded areas like Times Square, along popular highways or on the walls of buildings. Some companies may pay for mobile billboards, placing ads on the sides of trucks or public transportation vehicles. All billboards follow the same principles of print marketing, combining written content with coordinated color schemes, images and other visuals. Marketing teams need to get creative with billboards, such as applying bold colors or humorous content, since drivers and passersby may only have a few moments to take in a message.\n\nEvent Marketing\n\nEvent marketing relies on both company-sponsored and public events where a business can have conversations with customers and spread its brand through physical materials. Examples of company-sponsored events include hosting a conference or learning convention. Organizations may also join public events, such as setting up a booth at a local community arts fest. Companies should supply marketing teams with materials like tents, banners and flyers for interested individuals. If possible, it’s also helpful to have a sample of a product for consumers to view. Each event provides an opportunity for marketers to share information with consumers and answer any questions, spreading their company’s brand and earning new customers.\n\nProduct Marketing\n\nProduct marketing is vital to the success of a new product launch and is applicable across many industries. Even before the product is built, these marketers are doing intense market research to ensure that the product is the right fit for a company’s customers and that it serves a useful purpose. Then, the product team will use the product marketer’s insights as a guide on what to include in the new product. As the product is being built, the marketer will arm the sales team with the necessary knowledge and materials that will help them sell the product to current customers and reach out to new audiences. After a launch, the product marketer will ensure that customers aren’t having adoption issues and will craft marketing materials to make sure that the product stays relevant as time goes on.\n\nHow to Get Into Marketing\n\nMarketing is a unique field, filled with people who are analytical, yet have an in-depth understanding of human psychology and storytelling. Companies all over the world need competent marketers as more and more products are developed. Who best to evangelize a product other than the people who have the most knowledge about the industry? If you think that mixing analytics with storytelling sounds intriguing, then a career path in marketing might be for you.\n\nThis is the perfect time to get into a marketing role. It’s expected that the advertising and marketing industry will eclipse $786 billion by 2026. Digital marketing has taken on a larger role, with click-and-display ads becoming popular tools for marketers.\n\nMarketing Education Requirements\n\nMost marketing jobs require at least a bachelor’s degree in marketing, journalism, graphic design or a similar major. This shows hiring managers that you have a firm marketing background right away. Of course, having a degree isn’t the only way to break into the industry. There are plenty of reputable courses and bootcamps that can help you become a quality job candidate (or to learn more if you’re already in the industry).\n\nMarketing Career Path\n\nThere are a few career paths that can be taken. In a more traditional marketing sense, newcomers normally start out as marketing coordinators and then work their way up to marketing manager, marketing director and then CMO.\n\nDigital marketers have more options when it comes to roles and paths to take. These marketers usually start out as coordinators and can then experience roles like marketing specialist, search engine marketing manager, social media manager, or marketing director on their way to a CMO or VP of Marketing role. New job titles and responsibilities have been constantly popping up over the last few years due to the advent of new, groundbreaking technologies in the marketing field.\n\nMarketing Career Paths\n\nThere are many important roles that make up a marketing team because of the sector’s importance to the overall goals of a company.

      "# [What Is Consumer Technology? A Guide](https://builtin.com/consumer-tech)\nA Brief History of Consumer Tech\n\nConsumer technology is the umbrella term for any type of technology created with the general public’s use in mind. Think TVs, toaster ovens, smartphones and fitness apps.\n\nConsumer tech can be traced back to the 19th century, when early tech pioneers like David Edward Hughes, Heinrich Rudolph Hertz, Nikola Tesla and Jagadish Edward Bose manipulated electricity for widespread use throughout the world. Indeed, much of the consumer tech we still interact with daily was invented during this period of innovation set between the end of the 19th century and the mid-20th century, including computers (first developed between 1940-45), transistor radios (introduced in 1954) and the microwave oven (1946).\n\nTechnology has continued to develop over time, improving and creating products that are thousands of times more capable than predecessors while enabling form factors to shrink and prices to decrease — creating a technological revolution with the power to reshape our world. Computers, for instance, were once an exclusive product and would require an entire room to store just a few megabytes. Today, powerful computers exist in the pockets of 85 percent of Americans in the form of smartphones, capable of housing hundreds of gigabytes of data with unlimited amounts of cloud space available at all times.\n\nIn another few decades, the advances in consumer tech might be unfathomable to us today.\n\nConsumer Tech Companies\n\nAlphabet (Google)\n\nApple\n\nIntel\n\nSamsung\n\nSony\n\nTesla\n\nWhirlpool\n\nYamaha\n\nConsumer Tech Vs. High Tech\n\nWhile consumer tech typically refers to general-audience-oriented technology like lightbulbs, calculators, cell phones or televisions, high-tech products are slightly different. High tech, or advanced technology, can be thought of as the most cutting-edge forms of technology available, and sometimes refers to the newest type of technology on the market.\n\nOne example of high technology is autonomous mobile robotsthat help package goods. High-tech products such as autonomous vehicles can be used by the general public but are less common than consumer technology products like a microwave or bluetooth sound system.\n\nRead NextBye, Middleman: These Are the Trends Shaping E-Commerce Right Now\n\nTechnology has evolved to better meet and fulfill the needs of people, and as a result, people are now constantly interacting with consumer technology products. Several categories and subcategories of customer technology exist, with plenty of overlap.\n\nTypes of Consumer Technology\n\nAppliances\n\nSmart devices\n\nFitness wearables\n\nSelf-driving cars\n\nVideo game consoles and devices\n\nDrones\n\nComputer software\n\nAs more products are introduced at conferences like the Consumer Electronics Show, these categories will inevitably expand. There are hundreds of categories that could be listed here and products will continue to hit the market as technology evolves. Some of today’s most notable consumer tech categories include:\n\n5G Devices\n\nDevices connected to 5G networks — or 4G, LTE or any other form of cellular network — are able to receive network signals from cellular towers and provide users with online connectivity. Many of the most common forms of consumer electronics fall into this category, including smartphones, tablets and portable hotspots.\n\nIoT Devices\n\nInternet of Things, or IoT, devices connect to specific applications via the internet or other forms of wireless networks for unparalleled user visibility and control. Some common consumer tech products in the IoT devices category included smart home appliances, such as app-controlled thermostats, locks and lights, sensor-based products like doorbells with cameras set to alert users to movement, and various Bluetooth devices.\n\nComputers\n\nIn recent years, computers’ capabilities have increased while their costs have decreased. And everyday people use them for all sorts of reasons — work, gaming, video streaming, internet browsing and more. Laptops, desktops, tablets, gaming computers, video game consoles, smartphones, hard drives and several other types of devices fall into this consumer tech category.\n\nSelf-Driving and Electric Vehicle Consumer Tech\n\nSince their emergence in the early 20th century, cars and motor vehicles of all kinds have grown to become one of the most critical forms of consumer tech to most societies around the world. As technology has improved, so have cars, with vehicles now commonly possessing high-tech features such as built-in GPS, self-driving capabilities, automatic braking, lane sensors, rearview cameras, power steering, and a bevy of additional online and offline capabilities that enhance both safety and comfort. Electric vehicles have eliminated the need for wasteful natural gas resources and self-driving cars are on the rise.\n\nTelevisions and Smart Screens\n\nTelevision became a cultural phenomenon in the mid-20th century and its status has since become cemented as a focal point of modern society. The average American adult watches three hours of television per day, as of 2022. TV and smart screens have been bolstered by the many advancements that the near-century old medium has undergone. Today’s top-end “smart TVs” come loaded with WiFi/5G capabilities, built-in applications, internet search capabilities, built-in gaming features, computer monitoring and more.\n\nSmart Speakers\n\nLeading consumer tech companies like Amazon and Google have introduced a variety of home speakers with built-in virtual assistant technology. These speakers possess internet connectivity and can play music, look up information, place orders and complete a variety of additional tasks by linking to existing accounts. Three of the most popular smart speakers are the Amazon Echo, Apple HomePod and Google Home.\n\nAppliances\n\nHome appliances are a form of consumer tech products that allow people to live easier, more fulfilling lives. From microwave ovens and various kitchen appliances to laundry machines, space heaters and more, appliances of some kind can be found in a majority of homes worldwide.\n\nFitness and Wearables\n\nFitness and consumer tech have merged in seamless fashion, with people embracing devices that track their daily fitness goals and keep them engaged in their activities and workouts. Wearables expand beyond fitness, however, with devices and technology hitting the market that filter air, keep users temperate, alert the proper parties when in danger or in need of help, and much more. Wearable consumer tech includes smartwatches, fitness trackers, heart rate monitors, 911-alerting devices and tech-enabled clothing.\n\nGaming\n\nThe video gaming industry has exploded since its rise through the late 1970s and the 1980s. Today’s systems possess the processing capabilities that would have been unfathomable to game designers back in those days, such as 5K graphics, online gameplay and lightning-fast processor speeds. Video gaming consoles, games, software, VR devices, gaming computers, handheld consoles, add-ons, and accessories are all included in this category.\n\nDrones and Robotics\n\nDrones have been in military use since the 20th century, with commercial and consumer drones hitting the market in the early 21st century. Consumer drones have the ability to take photos, record videos and deliver packages at previously unreachable heights and distances, produced in a variety of form factors and with many accessories for customizing personal drone experiences.\n\nAudio and Music Consumer Tech\n\nSome consumers, whether audiophiles or musicians, take sound very seriously. This category is meant to address that, creating technologically advanced solutions that help them dial in the perfect sound response to their ears, in real time. Multi-room sound systems, Bluetooth speakers, amplifiers, interfaces, microphones, instruments and software all fall into this category of consumer tech.\n\nPhotography\n\nThe first cameras emerged in the late 19th century, since then, photography equipment has embraced digital and technological advancements to unlock capabilities like faster shutter speeds, faster lens speeds, 5K video capturing, low-light shooting and much more. Photography consumer tech includes camera bodies, lenses, sensors, hard drives, memory cards, flash units and additional accessories.\n\nDelivery Consumer Tech\n\nDelivery apps and food delivery platforms have become an integral part of people’s lives. Delivery services use several facets of technology to bring products right to our doors. This industry could not exist without the right software, mobile technology and vehicles.\n\nSoftware\n\nMuch of the consumer tech that people interact with is not a physical product but software that writes the rules to allow hardware to function. Software is responsible for enabling nearly all forms of consumer tech products to work and interact, from menu screens to full-on computer programs.\n\nRelated ReadingProptech: Everything You Need to Know (With 25 Examples)",
      "# [What Is Corporate Innovation and Why It Matters.](https://builtin.com/corporate-innovation)\nWhat Is a Corporate Innovation Strategy?\n\nCorporate innovation covers the strategic and thoughtful advancements that make corporations formidable long-term competitors in their markets. Research and development departments, made up of engineering and scientific teams, have long propelled corporate innovation. They discover solutions to emerging challenges, and design ways of putting these solutions into effect. The R&D field has grown significantly and now receives heavy input from marketing departments, creating a more holistic understanding of customer demands and how to best acquaint customers with new solutions.\n\nCompany mergers and acquisitions have also paved the way for corporate innovation. Mergers, which are historically less common than acquisitions, are when two separate companies — usually competitors — join to form a new company. Acquisitions, on the other hand, take place when a company agrees to purchase a separate, smaller company in its entirety to integrate within its existing corporate structure.\n\nAs industrial practices and technology developed throughout the 20th century, an influx of companies began to adjust to the rapidly evolving needs of consumers. The tactic of acquiring or merging with other organizations gives big corporations the means to take on innovation in leaps and bounds because they’re able to absorb the ideas that have already been taking shape at other, often more nimble, startups.\n\nIn more recent years, innovation has also taken the form of corporate incubator or accelerator programs. These initiatives can be designed to drive the development of ideas that originate from within an organization, or they can become collaborative workspaces where external startups are able to leverage an organization’s resources and expertise.\n\nFurther ReadingHow 23 Top Tech Disruptors Maintain the Magic\n\nWhy Corporate Innovation Is Important\n\nCorporate innovation is a necessary pursuit for any company looking to advance or remain at the top of its market well into the future. It provides the forward momentum that keeps organizations on top of technology trends and helps them modernize their products and services, as well as internal business practices. Planbox’s 2022 State of Corporate Innovation Report showed organizations that take an enterprise-wide approach to innovation are more likely to see their ideas successfully implemented.\n\nR&D, as well as the acquisition of startups and other companies, are viable forms of corporate innovation. But they are not the only strategies a corporation can embrace. By combining a variety of methodologies into their corporate innovation strategy, corporations can have access to a wide variety of ideas that allow them to extend their market longevity and find more success in staying ahead of the competition.\n\nTypes of Corporate Innovation: Open Innovation Vs. Closed Innovation\n\nThere are multiple ways to form an innovation strategy. Whether relying on internal teams or enlisting ideas from outside parties, corporate innovation typically falls into two buckets: closed innovation and open innovation.\n\nClosed Innovation\n\nClosed innovation refers to the utilization of internal means to create new ideas and build for the future. Common closed corporate innovation models include creating teams dedicated entirely to innovation, sourcing new ideas from existing employees, forming dedicated innovation teams and launching internal corporate accelerator programs.\n\nOpen Innovation\n\nOpen innovation refers to the sourcing of new products, ideas, and often, new brands from parties outside of the corporate structure. Corporations go about open innovation through investments and acquisitions, establishing innovation outposts, working with external accelerators or hosting competitions like hackathons and pitches.\n\nCorporate Innovation Models\n\nThese are some of the most common programs organizations implement to carry out open and closed corporate innovation strategies.\n\nClosed Innovation Models\n\nEmployee Sourcing\n\nThe most basic form of corporate innovation is capitalizing on the expertise and ingenuity of an organization’s employees. Existing employees are more intimately aware of the company’s nuances, customers, market and competition than any external party, giving them an ideal perspective for finding solutions to existing challenges or coming up with new product ideas.\n\nDedicated Innovation Teams\n\nMany companies have moved away from traditional R&D departments to concentrate instead on innovation labs. Innovation teams are typically composed of scientists and strategists who focus intently on improving existing products, launching groundbreaking new ideas, keeping up with customer needs and staying aware of the innovative executions from competitors.\n\nInternal Corporate Accelerator Programs\n\nA common closed innovation strategy is to launch an internal corporate accelerator program. Corporate accelerators provide technologically driven employees with funding and access to resources in exchange for their focus on solving existing challenges within the corporation.\n\nOpen Innovation Models\n\nInvestment and Acquisition\n\nFor many corporations, cash on hand can be the most valuable asset when it comes to innovation. By staying aware of startups and innovative companies adapting to customer needs, corporations can choose to invest in or attempt to acquire these organizations — leapfrogging competition and saving valuable innovation time.\n\nInnovation Outposts\n\nIn order for a corporation to successfully invest in innovative startups, they have to know where to find them. Many corporations accomplish this by establishing satellite offices in regional hotbeds known for specific industry innovation, such as Silicon Valley for tech or Detroit for the automotive industry. These outposts offer a high degree of networking potential with emerging companies in the area, as well as acting as create space for companies to focus on refining existing innovative ideas.\n\nExternal Corporate Accelerators\n\nAs opposed to internal corporate accelerators, external accelerators are established independently from corporate funding to enable startups to prioritize their own mission while innovating. Corporations can then sponsor these accelerators, build connections with startups and acquire new product ideas within the program. The top startups in external accelerators are often acquired by the sponsoring corporation or receive funding and reputation boosts that turn them into viable organizations.\n\nHackathons and Pitch Competitions\n\nForward-thinking corporations often utilize hackathons and pitch competitions to enlist corporate innovation. These events can be structured in several different ways, enlisting individuals, teams of amateurs, teams from startups and several other parties to solve challenges and provide ideas in a timely, structured manner. Winning teams are compensated in a variety of ways in exchange for their expertise and intellectual property.\n\nOpen Corporate Innovation Examples\n\nTechstars Accelerator\n\nTechstars is an independent accelerator that partners with corporate sponsors to provide startups with opportunities to match with companies that align with their mission. A notable success story came out of the 2014 accelerator when robotics company, Orbotix (now called Sphero) joined Techstars’ Disney-sponsored program. The company earned the opportunity to produce operational toy versions of BB-8 from the Star Wars franchise, coinciding with the franchise’s first film in 10 years. In 2015, sales from the BB-8 toy in a single month went on to match Sphero’s sales for the entirety of 2014.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Acquires Pixar, Marvel Entertainment & Lucasfilm\n\nThe Walt Disney Company can provide multiple examples of how a corporate innovation strategy with a heavy focus on open innovation can be essential to market success, with one of the most prominent being its historic success in acquisitions. One of its earliest large-scale acquisitions came in 2004 when the company acquired film studio Pixar for $7.4 billion. Then, in 2009, the corporation made a move to purchase superhero franchise Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion. Capping things off in 2012, Disney purchased Lucasfilm and its Star Wars franchise for $4.05 billion. The trio of acquisitions led to unquestionable success — The Walt Disney Company’s market capitalization came in at $46.97 billion in 2003, one year prior to the Pixar acquisition, and has since ballooned to $164.20 billion as of November 2022.\n\nCarousell\n\nInnovative graduates of the National University of Singapore, Lucas Ngoo and Quek Siu Rui, participated in a 2012 hackathon sponsored by Startup Weekend in Singapore. This hackathon is where the duo developed the idea for an application called Carousell that would simplify the process of selling off household clutter. The idea ended up winning first place in the competition. The startup has propelled its way to success — closing its Series C round of funding between $70 million - $80 million in 2017 and acquiring several companies since then.\n\nRead MoreHow I Used Economic Theory at Spotify to Disrupt the Music Business\n\nClosed Corporate Innovation Examples\n\nAmazon Lab 126\n\nIn 2003, Amazon founded its dedicated innovation lab, Amazon Lab126, with a single initiative to “reinvent the book.” The team spent several years researching and testing prototypes before finally releasing the first Kindle in 2007. The first run of Kindles sold out in under six hours, and the lab has continued to produce groundbreaking products like the Amazon Fire line, the Amazon Echo and over more than a dozen other generations of Kindle products.\n\nSAP.iO Venture Studio\n\nSAP is a software company focused on developing enterprise solutions for business operations and customer relations. In 2017, the company launched SAP.iO, described as its “strategic business unit to incubate startup innovation and drive new business models for the company.” The initiative provides support for external startups, but its Venture Studio program also facilitates incubation for internal startups conceived by SAP employees who have identified a business problem and potential solution. These employee-led ventures receive funding along with design, development and sales support to get off the ground and ultimately join a SAP business unit so that they can scale within the larger organization. The venture Paid Promptly by SAP, for example, automates receivable processes and is now available to customers through the SAP Store.",
      "# [What Is Cryptanalysis? (Definition, Types, Goals) by Anthony Corbo on 2023-01-03](https://builtin.com/articles/cryptanalysis)\nCryptanalysis is the study and discovery of vulnerabilities within cryptographic algorithms that can be used to decrypt ciphertext without knowledge of the secret key. Several forms of cryptanalysis can be used to attack cryptographic messages, ranging from the interception of messages within unsecured communication channels to the matching of plaintext based on the same algorithm techniques. Cryptanalysis also includes measures taken to stop attackers from decoding cryptographic algorithms.\n\nMore From Built In ExpertsHow to Break Into Cybersecurity\n\nTypes of Cryptanalysis\n\nThere are three generic forms of cryptanalysis: ciphertext-only, known ciphertext/plaintext pairs and chosen plaintext or chosen ciphertext.\n\nIn ciphertext-only cryptanalysis, the attacker has the ciphertext available to them for decoding. In known ciphertext/plaintext pair cryptanalysis, attackers will know some element of the plaintext and will be able to match likely elements of the ciphertext to the known plaintext. For example, a computer session may begin with “LOG IN.”\n\nDeciphering this string of text will also allow the attacker to decrypt plaintext that matches the deciphered ciphertext throughout the message. Chosen plaintext or chosen ciphertext cryptanalysis occurs when the attacker unwittingly causes either the transmitter to encrypt plaintext or the receiver to decrypt ciphertext. This provides the attacker with an abundance of knowledge, possibly even knowledge of the entire message’s contents.\n\nWhat Is the Primary Goal of Cryptanalysis?\n\nCryptanalysis is used to understand the contents of protected or encrypted messages and data in order to gain access to either in-transit or at-rest data. Attackers using cryptanalysis may have several goals for doing so, but the ultimate goal is always some degree of cryptographic decryption through either the ciphertext or plain text.\n\nSome specific goals associated with cryptanalysis include a total break (the locating of the secret key), global deduction (the locating of a functionally equivalent algorithm for encryption and decryption without knowledge of the secret key), information deduction (the acquiring of a portion of information about the plaintext or ciphertext that was not previously known), and the distinguishing of the algorithm (giving the attacker the ability to determine the encryption’s output from a random selection of plaintext).\n\nMore From the Built In Tech DictionaryWhat Is a DDoS Attack?\n\nWhat Does a Cryptanalyst Do?\n\nCryptanalysts can be hired to find security weaknesses, potential data leak causes, discover evidence from encrypted messages and more.\n\nCryptanalysts are often associated with government agencies or law enforcement, hired to ensure agency encryption methods are up to par with the current standards in cybersecurity and engage in the deciphering of encrypted messages. Cryptanalysts do this by purposefully exploiting weaknesses so fixes can be applied. As mentioned, government organizations often employ cryptanalysts to decipher encrypted communications and law enforcement agencies will hire cryptanalysts to decode encrypted messages within evidence or testify as experts on a case.\n\nRegardless of their industry or ethics, cryptanalysts must have a strong understanding of mathematics, ciphers, codes, and encryption systems, with daily responsibilities including analyzing intelligence information, diagnosing weaknesses within cryptographic algorithms, developing new cryptanalysis tools and more.",
      "# [Cyberloafing: What Is It and How To Prevent It by Dawn Kawamoto on 2022-11-28](https://builtin.com/articles/cyberloafing)\nCyberloafing in the workplace is a bad thing, right?\n\nAfter all, this habit of employees engaging in non-work-related internet surfing costs U.S. employers a whopping $85 billion a year, according to a University of Nevada report cited by the BBC.\n\nAnd 36 percent of millennials and Gen Z said they spend two or more hours per workday looking at their phones for personal activities, according to over 1,000 full-time U.S. workers surveyed in the 2018 Workplace Distraction Report by online learning company Udemy.\n\nWhat Is Cyberloafing?\n\nCyberloafing is when employees use their work time to engage in non-work-related internet activities from checking social media and personal email to web browsing and more.\n\nAnd with more people working from home following the pandemic, cyberloafing is only increasing.\n\nThe initial reaction often is to stomp out cyberloafing because of its adverse impact on productivity, but research is emerging that raises questions about its potential benefits (like addressing burnout), too.\n\nMore on Work CultureWhat Does Hybrid Work Culture Look Like?\n\nFree Guide: What Does it Take to Retain a Remote Workforce?\n\nHow to reduce turnover while increasing engagement and inclusion for remote employees.\n\nWhat Is Cyberloafing?\n\nCyberloafing is a term to describe employees who use work time to engage in non-work-related activities on the internet, such as web browsing, using social media, or checking and responding to personal email.\n\nAnd while its definition is relatively simple to describe, the way it can manifest makes it a complex matter. Some workers may turn to cyberloafing to relieve stress on the job and browse the internet as a coping mechanism, according to a study titled “Unraveling Cyberloafing Paradox: Towards a Targeted Approach for Managing Cyberloafing.”\n\nEmployees spending time browsing the internet on their phone, or emailing friends and looking at social media when they are supposed to be working on a report is a blatant example of cyberloafing, Bright Frimpong, a research assistant at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley and co-author of the “Unraveling Cyberloafing Paradox” study, told Built In.\n\nBut there are also a lot of gray areas when it comes to cyberloafing, Frimpong added. For example, he said, if there is a lull in your work while you wait for another team to finish a project to hand over to you, are you really cyberloafing if you use the time to check your personal email, look up sports scores or watch a YouTube video?\n\n“It’s very difficult to pinpoint these as cyberloafing behaviors because even though they are not productive, the employee has really nothing to do at that time,” Frimpong added. “I think it’s just a matter of being productive at the right time.”\n\nThe term was coined in 1995 but grew in popularity in 2002 after a research paper was published in the Organizational Behavior Journal on the topic. Initially, early research focused on the unproductive and harmful effects a company faced when its employees engaged in cyberloafing. But as study into this area matured, researchers began exploring other fringe areas of cyberloafing and the discovery of potential benefits began to emerge, Frimpong said.\n\nFind out who's hiring.\n\nSee all HR jobs at top tech companies & startups\n\nView Jobs\n\nWhat Causes Cyberloafing?\n\nTo understand the causes of cyberloafing, you need to understand what employees are trying to achieve by it. In some instances, there are tangible benefits like learning new skills. In others, the employee might use it for a much-needed break for their mental health or well-being.\n\nFor example, loneliness and workplace ostracism can prompt some employees to turn to social media to offset the lack of interaction with co-workers and others, said Natalie Mason, a PhD candidate at Aston University who is researching the use of cyberloafing as a coping mechanism and authored a report on the topic published in Nature Reviews Psychology.\n\nThese employees may find the emotional support they need to power through the rest of the day via social media, Mason said.\n\nWhat Causes Cyberloafing?\n\nLoneliness and workplace ostracism\n\nStress\n\nBurnout\n\nWorkplace aggression\n\nEmotional or physical pain\n\nBoredom\n\nDesire to find resources that make work and life better\n\nIn other cases, employees are using cyberloafing as a release valve for their stress, whether it’s from feeling burned out or because of workplace aggression from others, Mason said. It can provide a mental distraction that can help employees jump back into work once their cyberloafing break is over.\n\nCyberloafing can also help momentarily offset workplace boredom, allowing employees to take a mental break from their tasks and return refreshed.\n\nEmployees who lack adequate resources at work, such as an ergonomic office chair, may jump on the internet to learn of alternative resources they could use, like browsing for one. That internet activity, however, is considered a form of cyberloafing since it is not directly involved with the task at hand and is considered developing new non-work-related skills or abilities while on the job, Frimpong said.\n\nEmployer policies around allowing workers to bring their own electronic devices, such as smartphones, tablets or even laptops, into the workplace can also contribute to cyberloafing, since employees may feel it’s perfectly fine to use them anytime, despite being on the clock.\n\nMore on Mental HealthHow to Avoid Employee Burnout\n\nHow to Prevent Cyberloafing\n\nTo start, develop clear and equitable cyberloafing HR policies. Set expectations on the amount of time or circumstances where non-work-related internet activities would be allowed either on an employee’s personal device or the company’s equipment. Be sure to clearly note the websites and social media that would be prohibited.\n\nAnd rather than just address an employee’s actual cyberloafing behavior, try digging deeper into the “why” with them.\n\n“Managers need to be more understanding of why someone might go to their phone or use the internet during a time they should be productive at work.”\n\n“There are so many motivations that go into cyberloafing. So, to really understand how to stop it or manage it, you need to know the motivations behind it,” Frimpong said.\n\nIn some cases, for example, employees may lack the self-awareness to know they are using social media at work because they feel ostracized by their teammates, but in other cases, they might be aware of this reason. In either situation, the issue should be discussed with the employee’s manager, Mason said.\n\nWays to Prevent Cyberloafing\n\nSet expectations on when non-work-related internet activities are allowed, and on which devices.\n\nClearly note websites and social media that are prohibited.\n\nIdentify triggers for employees who might be engaging in non-work-related internet activities to reduce emotional or physical issues.\n\nHave open conversations with employees to understand why they may be resorting to cyberloafing.\n\n“Managers need to be more understanding of why someone might go to their phone or use the internet during a time they should be productive at work,” Mason told Built In. “There should be open communication between you and your employees to understand why they are doing these actions.”\n\nFor employees who turn to cyberloafing to improve their well-being or to reduce emotional or physical discomfort, it comes down to identifying the triggers for those behaviors and then addressing them through conversations with the employee in question.\n\nIn cases where cyberloafing is excessive and interfering with meeting deadlines or completing projects, it can be useful to explore the problem through another lens.\n\n“You have to look at cyberloafing as the same way you would diagnose mental illness,” Mason said. “If it gets in the way of your everyday life, then it’s excessive. If it’s stopping you from meeting your deadlines and doing your everyday job, it’s excessive.”",

      "# [What Is LangChain? by Juan Ramirez on 2024-04-01](https://builtin.com/articles/langchain)\nLangChain is a framework that supports the development of applications that run on large language models (LLMs). In software development, a framework acts as a template for building apps, containing a collection of resources created and tested by developers and engineers. Since LangChain is open-source, anyone can access it and tailor it to their needs.\n\nBy providing a library of components for working with language models, LangChain reduces the need to write complex code and enables developers to quickly perform tasks like designing new prompts and connecting LLMs to sources of more recent data. This speeds up the development of generative AI applications.\n\nUnderstanding LangChain is critical for developers looking to harness the power of advanced language models like GPT-4 in their technology stack.\n\nMore from Juan Ramirez6 Reasons to Learn Julia in 2024‍\n\nWhat Is LangChain?\n\nLangChain is a model-agnostic, open-source framework that gives developers the flexibility to experiment with various LLMs to discover the optimal fit for their unique applications. It offers a generic interface to a range of foundational models. It has the ability to facilitate context-aware and reasoning-based applications through its comprehensive components, including the LangChain Libraries, Templates, LangServe and LangSmith.\n\nWhy LangChain Is Important\n\nLangChain streamlines the development of generative AI application interfaces, a critical component in crafting cutting-edge NLP applications. By simplifying the integration of sophisticated language model capabilities, such as those offered by GPT-4, LangChain significantly lowers the barriers to entry for developers.\n\nThis ease of integration is transformative, enabling developers to harness the latest advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence effortlessly. Consequently, LangChain is not merely a tool but a catalyst for innovation, empowering developers to create software solutions that leverage the forefront of AI technology.\n\nLangchain’s adoption of the MIT license merits special attention for its implications on development freedom. This permissive licensing framework allows developers to fork the codebase for individual projects and to innovate commercial products grounded in LangChain’s capabilities. Such openness drives innovation and paves the way for widespread adoption of the technology across various sectors.\n\nHow Does LangChain Work?\n\nLangChain provides tools and APIs through Python- and Javascript-based libraries, which streamline the development of LLM-powered applications such as chatbots and virtual assistants.\n\nLangChain’s module-based approach enables developers to dynamically compare different prompts and even various foundation models with minimal code adjustments. This flexibility is crucial for applications that use multiple LLMs, for instance, one model to interpret user queries and another to author responses. Such a modular environment reduces the need for extensive coding, making it easier for both specialists and newcomers to experiment and prototype with generative AI programs.\n\nLangChain bridges the gap between LLM capabilities and the specific needs of an application by facilitating the integration with external data sources and software workflows. This allows for applications that are more responsive to real-world information and that provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.\n\nFurthermore, LangChain underscores the importance of prompt engineering — the art of composing effective prompts that guide LLMs to deliver desired outcomes. By formalizing the composition of prompts through its PromptTemplate class, LangChain allows developers to easily structure prompts that include context instructions, examples for few-shot prompting, specified output formats or standardized questions. This capability streamlines the development process and enhances the interaction quality between users and LLM-driven applications.\n\nKey Components of LangChain\n\nLangChain is engineered to empower developers with a suite of functionalities that streamline the creation and management of applications leveraging large language models. Here are some of the key components that make LangChain an essential tool for developers in the fields of software, AI and machine learning.\n\nLangChain Libraries\n\nThese libraries offer a suite of composable tools and integrations tailored for working with language models. They contain off-the-shelf chains designed for higher-level tasks, streamlining the development process. The libraries are organized into packages like langchain-core, langchain-community and langchain, each serving specific functions within the framework.\n\nLangChain Expression Language (LCEL)\n\nLCEL provides a declarative method for composing chains. It supports no-code changes in production environments, which is crucial for developers who need to make quick adjustments to their applications. LCEL comes with comprehensive documentation, including an overview, interface guides, how-to instructions and a cookbook for reference.\n\nStandard Interfaces and Modules\n\nLangChain offers standardized, extendable interfaces for Model I/O, Retrieval and Agents modules. This ensures a consistent approach to integrating various components and simplifies complex processes like prompt chaining, logging, callbacks, persistent memory and establishing efficient connections to multiple data sources. With complex applications being easier to build, developers can focus on innovation rather than the intricacies of implementation.\n\nPrompt Management Framework\n\nLangChain’s prompt management framework serves as a central interface for long-term memory, external data, other LLMs and agents. This aspect of LangChain is part of the emerging LLMOps trend, which focuses on creating tools to work effectively with large language models, marking a significant step forward in the field of AI and machine learning. LangChain helps bridge the gap between data and language models, offering developers a unified platform to explore the full potential of LLMs in their software projects.\n\nMemory Module\n\nThe framework offers a memory module that provides plug-and-play access to various data stores. This feature is particularly useful for applications involving conversations, as it allows for the automatic saving of message history, enhancing the user experience by maintaining context.\n\nAgents API\n\nDevelopers can use the agents API to create sophisticated agents capable of multi-turn conversations. This API supports advanced features that promote minimal human intervention, thus fostering the autonomy of the agents.\n\nSupport for Multiple LLMs\n\nLangChain’s compatibility with LLMs from both Hugging Face Hub and OpenAI broadens the scope for developers to choose the best model for their application. Whether it’s generating text using a Hugging Face model like Google/flan-t5-xl or using OpenAI’s GPT-3 generation models such as text-DaVinci-003, LangChain facilitates seamless integration.\n\nAgent Trajectory Feature\n\nA standout feature of LangChain is the native agent trajectory, which allows for the evaluation of an agent’s behavior and performance. By analyzing the inputs and outputs, developers can assess the necessity of actions taken and score the performance, crucial for refining agent behavior.\n\nCustom Trajectory Evaluators\n\nAddressing issues like hallucination or inconsistent scoring is made easier with custom trajectory evaluators that enable users to define their evaluation criteria and scoring systems.\n\nStructured Tools and Modules\n\nLangChain provides a variety of tools and modules, including embeddings that quantify the semantic relatedness of text strings. Its advanced Structured Tools facilitate interactive connections between language models and external tools, paving the way for innovative applications.\n\nLangChain Applications and Use Cases\n\nReal-world applications across various industries showcase LangChain’s ability to enhance communication and streamline processes. Here are some practical use cases.\n\nCollaborative Frameworks\n\nIn partnership with Yeager.ai, LangChain’s GenWorlds framework creates specialized environments where AI agents and shared objects work together to perform complex tasks. This modularity and reliability are critical for developers who aim to build sophisticated systems that require coordination among various components.\n\nTranslation Services\n\nUse of LangChain in the translation industry has led to more accurate and efficient services. More than 10,000 businesses have benefited from LangChain’s translation services, too. It has translated more than 1 billion words, illustrating the profound impact it has had on global communication and business operations.\n\nE-Learning Platforms\n\nBy integrating LangChain, e-learning platforms can offer multilingual support, making educational content accessible globally.

      "# [What Is an FET (Field-Effect Transistor)? by Artem Oppermann on 2023-04-10](https://builtin.com/hardware/fet)\nA field-effect transistor (FET) is a type of transistor that uses an electric field to control the current flow through a semiconductor channel. FETs are widely used in electronic circuits due to their high input impedance, low output impedance and high gain.\n\nMore From This ExpertWhat Is an Electrical Charge?\n\nCharacteristics of an FET\n\nVoltage-Controlled Device\n\nAn FET is a voltage-controlled device. This means that its output current is controlled by the voltage we apply to its gate terminal.\n\nHigh-Input Impedance\n\nFETs have very high input impedance, which means they do not load down the signal source and can be used as buffer amplifiers. Using FETs as buffer amplifiers can help prevent signal distortion and improve the overall quality of the circuit’s output. Additionally, FETs are power-efficient, which makes them an attractive choice for battery-powered devices.\n\nUnipolar Device\n\nFETs are unipolar devices, which means they use only one type of charge carrier (electrons or holes) to control the current flow. The alternative to a unipolar device is a bipolar device. Unlike a unipolar device like an FET, a bipolar device such as a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) uses both electrons and holes to control the current flow. Bipolar devices have a high current gain and can handle higher power levels, which makes them suitable for power amplification applications.\n\n3 Terminals\n\nThe source, the drain and the gate are an FET’s three terminals. The source and drain are connected to the channel, while the gate controls the flow of current through the channel.\n\nRelated ReadingNMOS Transistors and PMOS Transistors Explained\n\nChannel Conductivity\n\nWe can control the conductivity of the channel in an FET by the voltage we apply to the gate. In an n-channel FET, a positive voltage applied to the gate will attract electrons to the channel and increase its conductivity. In a p-channel FET, a negative voltage applied to the gate will attract holes to the channel and increase its conductivity.\n\nTypes of FETs\n\nJunction Field-Effect Transistor (JFET)\n\nIn a JFET, the channel consists of a semiconductor material and the channel has two regions at each end. These are known as the source and the drain terminals. The gate is a PN junction that’s formed perpendicular to the channel. The gate terminal is biased in reverse. This creates a depletion region that controls the width of the channel. When we apply a voltage to the gate, the depletion region widens, thereby reducing the channel width and the current flowing through it.\n\nMetal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET)\n\nSimilar to JFETs, in MOSFETs the channel is also formed by a semiconductor material and it has two regions at either end, known as the source and drain terminals. In a MOSFET however, the gate is separated from the channel by a thin insulating layer that typically consists of silicon dioxide. As soon as a voltage is applied to the gate, it creates an electric field that attracts or repels charge carriers in the channel, depending on the voltage’s polarity. This process controls the width of the channel and the flow of current between the source and drain terminals.\n\nMOSFETs can be further classified into two subtypes: enhancement-mode and depletion-mode MOSFETs.\n\nEnhancement-Mode MOSFETs\n\nIn enhancement-mode MOSFETs, the channel is normally off and you must apply a positive voltage to the gate in order to turn it on.\n\nDepletion-Mode MOSFETs\n\nIn depletion-mode MOSFETs, the channel is normally on and you must apply a negative voltage to the gate to turn it off.\n\nAdvantages of Using an FET\n\nFETs have several advantages over other types of transistors, which make them popular in a variety of electronic applications.\n\nHigh-input impedance: FETs have very high input impedance, which means we can use them to buffer and amplify signals without loading down the signal source. As a result, FETs are ideal for use in preamplifiers, mixers and other signal processing circuits.\n\nLow noise: FETs have low noise levels, which means we can use them in low-noise amplifiers and other applications where noise is a concern.\n\nLow power consumption: FETs require very little power to operate so they’re ideal for battery-powered devices and other low-power applications.\n\nFast switching speed: FETs have very fast switching speeds, which make them ideal for use in digital circuits, switching power supplies and other high-frequency applications.\n\nTemperature stability: FETs have excellent temperature stability, which means their performance remains consistent over a wide range of temperatures.\n\nHigh voltage handling capability: FETs can handle high voltage, which makes them suitable for use in high-voltage circuits such as power amplifiers and power supplies.\n\nMore From the Built In Tech DictionaryWhat Is an EMP?\n\nDisadvantages of Using an FET\n\nDespite their advantages, FETs nevertheless have some disadvantages we should consider when designing electronic circuits.",

      "# [What Is a Firewall? (Definition, Types, Examples) by Mitchell Telatnik on 2023-03-28](https://builtin.com/articles/firewall)\nA firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic from a computer network. By allowing only authorized traffic and blocking unwanted traffic, firewalls protect against unauthorized access, malware and other security threats. Firewalls can also prevent sensitive data from leaving the network.\n\nHow Does a Firewall Work?\n\nA firewall inspects incoming and outgoing network traffic, and makes decisions based on the ruleset. The data sent over a computer network is assembled into a packet, which contains the sender and recipient’s IP addresses and port numbers. Before a packet is delivered to its destination, it’s sent to the firewall for inspection. If the firewall determines the packet is permitted, it will send it to the destination; otherwise, the firewall will drop the packet.\n\nThe criteria the firewall uses to determine whether or not the packet is permitted is called a ruleset. For example, a firewall rule may say to drop all traffic incoming to port 22, which is commonly used to log in to computers remotely using SSH (secure shell). In this case, when a packet arrives with the destination port of 22, the firewall will ignore it and fail to deliver it to the source IP.\n\nMore From Built In’s Tech DictionaryWhat Is SSO?\n\nAdvantages of a Firewall\n\nFirewalls create a layer of protection against unauthorized access to your network.\n\nFirewalls help organizations manage their bandwidth usage.\n\nFirewalls help you monitor your network traffic so you can identify and respond to threats quickly.\n\nFirewalls prevent viruses and malware from infecting systems and spreading throughout the network.\n\nNetwork Security\n\nFirewalls are essential tools for keeping networks secure and there are many advantages to using them in your network design. One of the most important advantages is that firewalls create a layer of protection against unauthorized access to your network. By blocking traffic from untrusted sources, firewalls act as a gatekeeper and prevent external threats like unauthorized access attempts, malware and viruses. In short, a firewall helps keep an organization’s data safe and prevent security breaches that can cause significant damage.\n\nOrganizational Control\n\nFirewalls also give an organization control over their network traffic. This means it’s easier for organizations to manage their bandwidth use and prioritize what applications they use regularly. For example, you can set rules to ensure that business-critical applications get the resources they need while limiting the amount of bandwidth used by non-essential applications like social media or video streaming. Additionally, firewalls provide real-time visibility into your network traffic, thereby allowing you to detect and respond to potential security threats quickly.\n\nProtection Against Malware and Viruses\n\nAnother critical advantage of using a firewall is that it provides protection against malware and viruses. By blocking traffic from known malicious sources, firewalls prevent viruses and malware from infecting systems and spreading throughout the network. With cyber threats becoming more sophisticated, firewalls are an essential defense against these risks. Some firewalls can even scan for malware and viruses on outgoing traffic, which provides even more protection against cyber attacks.\n\nTypes of Firewalls\n\nThere are three major categories of firewalls: network firewalls, host-based firewalls and web application firewalls.\n\n1. Network Firewalls\n\nA network firewall is the most common type of firewall. It inspects and manages both incoming and outgoing communications from the network. For example, a company may place a network firewall to block incoming and outgoing communications from the internet. Organizations may also place network firewalls within their network between what are called network segments. These types of firewalls allow the organization to control communications between different groups of devices. There are different types of network firewalls.\n\nStatic Network Firewalls\n\nStatic network firewalls, also known as packet-inspection firewalls, filter only on the individual packet information using the source and destination IP address, protocol and ports.\n\nStateful Firewalls\n\nStateful firewalls keep track of network sessions, which helps the firewall understand the context of a single packet in relation to others and make better decisions about what to allow or deny.\n\nNext-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)\n\nNext-generation firewalls combine multiple features such as application-level filtering, integrated intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) and content filtering. This combination of features makes NGFWs the most common type of firewall today.\n\nFind out who's hiring.\n\nSee jobs at top tech companies & startups\n\nView All Jobs\n\n2. Host-Based Firewalls\n\nHost-based firewalls monitor and control the inbound and outbound network traffic of an individual device on which they are installed. Unlike network firewalls, which control the flow of traffic across an entire network, host-based firewalls work on a per-device basis. We can install them as third-party software but they’re also sometimes included in the base operating system such as Windows or MacOS.\n\nBy controlling the traffic on a per-device basis, host-based firewalls can provide more granular control over the communication of an individual device. This control can be useful in situations where a device needs to communicate with specific servers or services, but not others. For example, we can configure a host-based firewall to allow communication with a particular web server, but block communication with other servers.\n\nIn addition, our devices may be vulnerable to security threats when connected to unknown networks, such as a local coffee shop’s public network. Host-based firewalls are useful for devices we often connect to different networks.\n\nMore From Built In Cybersecurity ExpertsMutual TLS: A Tutorial\n\n3. Web Application Firewalls (WAF)\n\nWeb application firewalls are specialized firewalls designed to control network access to web applications, such as websites. Web application firewalls are placed in front of a web application, which means that if you’re interacting with a website, you’ll be sending packets to the WAF instead of the web server itself. The WAF will then determine if your connection is permitted or denied. Web application firewalls operate at layer seven of the OSI model and filter HTTP connections in order to protect against threats such as injection attacks, request forgery, cross-site scripting, broken access control and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.\n\nFirewall Applications\n\nFirewalls provide the foundation for network security and can have multiple applications for protecting an organization’s resources. Here are some common scenarios.\n\nPreventing unauthorized access to resources\n\nPreventing command and control traffic\n\nContent filtering\n\nNetwork data loss protection\n\nIdentifying network intrusion attempts\n\n1. Preventing Unauthorized Access to Resources\n\nOne of the core applications of a firewall is to control access to resources on a network and prevent unauthorized access to those resources.\n\nFor example, let’s say we deployed a file share server that allows employees to store and access files centrally instead of keeping local copies on their devices. Anyone who is not an employee, however, should not be able to access this file share. To help enforce this, we can create a firewall rule that states any incoming networking communication to the file share server that did not originate from the corporate network should be denied.\n\n2. Preventing Command and Control Traffic\n\nWhen attackers gain unauthorized access to a network, they will sometimes install malware that enables them to remotely send the computer commands. Large groups of these infected computers are often referred to as “botnets.” Using threat intelligence such as the IP addresses of known command and control infrastructure, the network traffic can be denied by the firewall before it ever establishes a connection.\n\nRelated ReadingHow to Protect Your System From Botnet Malware\n\n3. Filtering Content\n\nYou may know content filtering as the annoying blocks when you visit sites such as Facebook. While blocking sites that do not have a business purpose is a capability of most modern firewalls, the most common reason we implement content filtering is to prevent employees from accessing known malicious websites.\n\nFor example, if we know that a website is compromised and could pose a risk of malware, content filtering allows us to check if the user is attempting to access that site. If so, the traffic can be denied and the user redirected to a notice message instead.\n\n4. Preventing Network Data Loss\n\nSimilar to inspecting network traffic for known malicious websites, we can inspect network traffic for sensitive data such as credit card information, personally identifiable information or trade secrets. If this data is detected in the traffic, we can choose to allow or deny it based on various parameters, such as the destination site.\n\nLet’s say, for example, that a user is attempting to upload credit card information to Dropbox. Before their network traffic leaves the network, it is routed through a firewall that has a rule to drop all traffic with credit card information unless the website is one of the few approved by the information security team, which prevents the employee from uploading the data.\n\n5.

      "# [Nanorobotics: Theory, Applications, How Does It Work? by Artem Oppermann on 2023-03-03](https://builtin.com/robotics/nanorobotics)\nNanorobotics refers to the emerging field of science and technology that deals with the design, development and control of robots at the nanoscale.\n\nThe nanoscale includes the size range of 1 to 100 nanometers, where one nanometer (nm) is equal to one billionth of a meter.\n\nSince nanorobots are robots built to operate at the nanoscale, they could perform tasks that are beyond the capabilities of conventional macro-scale robots. Nanorobots would have unique properties and capabilities that allow them to control and manipulate materials at the nanoscale, which would make them highly valuable for a wide range of applications and industries.\n\nUsing nanorobots can also lead to cost savings and improved efficiency. For example, in healthcare, nanorobots could be used for targeted drug delivery, which can reduce the amount of medication a patient needs and minimize side effects, thereby resulting in cost savings for patients and healthcare providers. Nanorobots could also be used for non-invasive surgeries to reduce the need for lengthy hospital stays and recovery times. It’s clear the field of nanorobotics has the potential to bring significant, positive changes and benefit society in numerous ways.\n\nRelated Reading From This ExpertWhat Is Nanotechnology?\n\nHow Do Nanorobotics Work?\n\nNanorobotics work by using robots at nanoscale, which are also known as nanorobots. The design and operation of nanorobots can vary depending on their intended use. In general, nanorobots would work by using various technologies like nanoscale sensors, control systems and nanoscale actuators.\n\nThe sensors in nanorobots could detect specific signals or conditions like the presence of a certain type of molecule or material, and then transmit this information to the control system. The control system could then use this information to decide on the proper action for the nanorobot. We could use the nanorobots’ actuators to perform a wide range of actions including movement, releasing of drugs in the human body or the manipulation of structures and materials (more on this below).\n\nIn order to perform their intended tasks, nanorobots need to be able to navigate and interact with their environment. This can be accomplished by a variety of methods like self-propulsion, remote control, or through chemical or biological means.\n\nWhat Are the Challenges of Nanorobotics?\n\nThe development and implementation of nanorobotics faces several challenges, including:\n\nTechnical Complexity: Designing and operating nanorobots is a complicated process that involves many technical difficulties like development of nanoscale components, controlling the movement of the nanorobots and ensuring their stability.\n\nSafety Concerns: The potential for nanorobots in medical applications and the environment raises concerns about their safety. For example, nanorobots, designed for medical treatments, could harm patients in the case of a malfunction.\n\nRegulatory Issues: There are currently few regulations in place to govern the development and use of nanorobots, which may slow their widespread adoption by public and private sector entities.\n\nFunding and Resources: The development of nanorobotics is quite expensive and requires significant funding and resources, as well as specialized equipment and human expertise.\n\nScalability: The development and production of large numbers of nanorobots can be challenging due to the complex and time-consuming nature of the manufacturing process.\n\nFind out who's hiring.\n\nSee all Developer + Engineer jobs at top tech companies & startups\n\nView 10000+ Jobs\n\nAre Nanorobotics Dangerous?\n\nIf not properly designed and controlled, nanobots could cause harm to a living organism or the environment. Let’s say, hypothetically, that nanobots are designed and programmed to target and remove a specific type of cellular debris in a human body. Instead, the nanobots could end up attacking healthy cells or tissues, which will cause harm to the patient. This situation could occur if the nanobots cannot properly distinguish between the targeted debris and healthy cells, or in the case of the nanobots malfunction. Another risk would involve the potential for the harmful use of nanorobots. For example, nanorobots could be used as weapons or for industrial espionage.\n\nDue to these mentioned challenges, the development of nanorobotics has been slow so far and commercial use seems far away. However, we’ve seen progress and it’s likely that these challenges will be overcome in the coming decades.\n\nMore in Nanotechnology10 Nanotechnology Examples Making a Big Impact\n\nApplications of Nanorobotics\n\nThe field of nanorobotics has a wide range of potential applications across various industries. It’s important to note that many of these applications are still theoretical.",

You can even add which technologies you’ve utilized at roles the way LinkedIn is currently trying to add skills. Not all the jobs are technical, like programming or product management, but if you’re in the tech industry, that’s the niche the job board is in. \n\nSomething really nice about Otta is that they include the Glassdoor ratings for companies as well, which is great because sometimes startups, especially the earlier stage or ones with <500 employees, can be a bit dicey around inexperienced management and claiming work/life balance while in reality push the “hustle” mentality. \n\nThey’re great for finding Remote-based work as well, since a lot of startups/fast-paced growing companies don’t care yet about HR laws and regulations across different states, they care about the talent. Once companies get bigger and older, they typically only hire remotely from states where they have established entities because of all the paperwork and the need to stay up-to-date with individual state compliance.\n\n- Edited for clarity around tech industry/companies versus tech positions like programming.\n\n#### Comment ID ivb743n with +2 score by [(that_writer_dream, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/ivb743n/) (in reply to ID ivb0vfu):\nThey actually work with a pretty even amount of start-ups and large companies (Deliveroo, Bumble, Spotify, the Financial Times).

It's helped me land several interviews whereas on the company website you can easily get screened out. Apply on BOTH LinkedIn and the company website.\n\nThe benefit of LinkedIn easy apply is that for several companies (not all) let you just send in a resume without any additional info unlike the company site where you have to waste time copying your resume. Also, if you are getting screened out, recruiters can see your resume more easily through LinkedIn especially if you are one of the first applications. You often get notified if your resume gets read or downloaded, which doesn't mean anything, but gives you additional data on what types of roles and companies are interested.\n\nI've landed two solid jobs through LinkedIn easy apply.

If an offer sounds too good to be true, if the wording feels awkward and overly vague, etc.\n\nMuch of this knowledge just comes from being in an industry for a while and recognizing the normal way roles are talked about. \n\nThat said, here’s the steps I would recommend for everyone:\n\n1. Do enough research into your industry to recognize the standard job title naming conventions and job scope for your level. For example, an entry level marketing role is typically going to be called something like “marketing associate” or “marketing coordinator”, or more specific depending on branch of marketing, so “content marketing associate” etc. For job scope, there will be a few things in your industry that you’ll learn are red flags. For marketing, if they talk about outbound calling, prospecting, sales, etc. then it’s likely a sales role pretending to be a marketing role. If you don’t know what these red flags are in your industry, reach out to a more senior member of this industry through LinkedIn and ask them directly, “what red flags should I watch out for in job postings?”\n\n2. Assuming you find a role that passes the job title and job scope test, start Googling the company. Search for things like “ X company reviews” and “X company scam”. Then visit 1. The companies Glassdoor page 2. The company’s LinkedIn page 3. The company’s website\n\n2a. Does there Glassdoor have multiple positive reviews, salaries listed, etc? (If the company is a small startup, they may have limited info here but still be legit).\n\n2b. Is the company findable on LinkedIn? Do they have many people who say they work there?  Click into these people and make sure they all seem legit. To they have previous experience at different companies? Do they seem to be active profiles?\n\n2c. Finally, visit their website. Does it seem to be a full website? (Not just one or two pages). Does the branding seem trustworthy? Then find the internal job listings page on the website. Is the job listing you saw also listed on their website? If not, there’s a chance that the company is legit, but scammers are pretending to be from the company when they’re not.\n\nIf after all of this, the company still seems legitimate, than apply! When interviewing, make sure you:\n 1. Meet the interviewers face-to-face or on a video chat sometime in the interview process (most start with a phone screen, that’s okay as long as you video chat later). \n2. Only communicate with email addresses that are linked to the company. Example: john@amazon.com. \n3. Don’t give any personal banking or social security # information until contracts have been signed and finalized and you feel 200% sure they are for real.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n### Comment ID ivbjona with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/ivbjona/) (in reply to ID iva7h7u):\nkey word.  \"Depending on industries\".  lol\n\n## Comment ID iva2ufb with +33 score by [(LincHayes, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/iva2ufb/) (in reply to ID ynpo8w):\nIn my experience, after Linked In, the quality of postings, and recruiters goes down significantly.

The cost to hire you is paid by the employer. The more money they have to pay for you, the more they actually value you. Companies who are willing to pay the fee to hire you have invested in you and will respect you more and won’t be as difficult to get raises in the future.

I got laid off a month ago and went back to the misery of job huntng on LinkedIn. \n\nI was working in tech before, so i knew there was a better way. I wanted to essentially create something that would check my CV, and find the most relevant jobs on the internet to return them back to me in seconds. Better than spending hours on LinkedIn reading irrelevant long job postings (even skimming them was boring)\n\nThe apps i found would use ai to apply to jobs for you and I found some scary reviews. Apparently they just send applications made with AI absolutely everywhere hoping you land one. They are playing a number game basically. \n\nI knew the tool had to be an assistant. not an automation. The only automation id allow would be the one that finds the relevant jobs for me. the cv and cover letter writing can be supported by AI but not fully generated by AI. Something like a draft at most.\n\nAnyways... long story short. I took matter into my own hands and created [wizapply.app](http://wizapply.app) . While still at its early stage, there is a beta version that helps you quickly review job postings and generate TLDR sumamries with job score match to quickly decide if you want to read the whole thing or just move on. Quickly.  \n  \nThe next version is aimed at fully building the web app that creates lists of relevant job lsitings in just seconds.   \n  \nCurious to know if this is something anyone here would use\n\n## Comment ID lfkth8v with +1 score by [(AcademicGanache6322, Reddit, 2024-07-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/lfkth8v/) (in reply to ID ynpo8w):\nhey\n\n## Comment ID lgmb740 with +1 score by [(Artistic_Ladder9570, Reddit, 2024-08-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/lgmb740/) (in reply to ID ynpo8w):\ni have no idea, i'm currently trying to find one myself\n\n## Comment ID lhpz0mz with +1 score by [(Affectionate-Ad-7438, Reddit, 2024-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/lhpz0mz/) (in reply to ID ynpo8w):\nThe thing I hate is when, it says it's hiring but they are not...

I live in a very small town but have a specialized background (DevOps). I’m glad I made the decision to go full-remote. The room for growth, benefits, work/life balance, and pay were all better than anything I could find locally.\n\nHere is another pro-tip regarding looking up remote positions:\n\nWhen using Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Indeed, etc. search using their “Remote” flag to find remote positions.\n\nHowever, also be sure to look for positions in “Remote, OR”\n\nSome recruiters don’t list them correctly, or something gets messed up when copying the job listing all over (from one service to another). Typically these remote jobs (with positions listed in ‘Remote, OR’) have less applicants. Also Remote, Oregon is a small town so luckily it’s easy to see if the position was intended for the actual town or for “Remote”\n\n### Comment ID jd7pcz6 with +1 score by [(tennisguy163, Reddit, 2023-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/jd7pcz6/) (in reply to ID hm2b17u):\nGood god, one job on there has over 5,000 applicants.

Zip recruiter is nice where employers can “like” your resume or application, rate it, give feedback, and even contact you through it to say “you look qualified for our position.

Full time.  Last year during full on covid.\n\nLinkedIn, Indeed, and a network of recruiters I have come to know from many contracts I have done.  \n\nIndeed was the worst, and normally was just cross posts and never used the Indeed built in system\n\nLinkedIn was actually pretty awesome with the open to work feature and their revamped job searching. \n\nMy recruiter network got me a handful of interviews  and an offer.\n\nLinkedIn recruiter who got in touch with me actually got me the position, so a huge win for LinkedIn. I used the offer I had to knock my pay up even more.  Thanks job I was never going to take!\n\nThese recruiters use tools to search LinkedIn profiles for keywords, so your profile can literally make or break you.  These recruiters don't understand what x buzzword is. They spend seconds on your profile to see if you are a possible match and move on, so your profile should be as complete as possible..  Have some project work to give them an idea of what kind of work you can do.\n\nThe better my profile was, the more I got random recruiters  to contact me, and about better jobs.\n\nThis is the way now.

That wasn't the point of the comment, though I guess I could have worded it better.  It was meant to be a quick response for OP's question.\n\nWhat actually happened in my case was that I received an offer for a higher paying job at a larger company.  At the same time I actually really liked the team and hit it off with the CIO at a smaller company, offering less.  I negotiated informing the smaller company that I really wanted the position, but that I had another offer at a higher pay.  The smaller company came back that if we wrapped the deal up immediately they would come up and match.\n\nIt wasn't that they didn't value me, they had a price they offered for the position.  On the contrary...They liked me, I liked them, but I informed them I had a higher offer.  They thought I was worth it and went above their original salary offer.\n\nAlmost two years in, I still love the position, love the team, have a much better work/life balance than had I taken the first offer, and so wouldn't change a thing.\n\nInforming a prospective employer that you have an existing offer, and negotiating to get yourself better pay/benefits/etc. seems is pretty standard.  Was it risky?  Sure, it had elevated risk that the job I really wanted to get would leave the table, but it was something I took a chance on, and it instead validated my belief that they did value me.  Also, I had no duty to the first company, and simply informed them I would be taking another offer.  No bridges burnt, so cards used, no shit list necessary.  It's just business.  \n\nI don't really think \"the proper amount\" exists.  We negotiate with what employers feel we are worth from a multitude of reasons and what that is can be different for the same person at the same positions at various companies.\n\n## Comment ID hm27j7q with +5 score by [(Zengaroni, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm27j7q/) (in reply to ID r1ynlc):\nI have always used LinkedIn.

USAJobs is more useful for those eligible for things like Pathways internships\\\\Recent grad programs, as it effectively puts you into a totally different hiring pool instead of getting curb-stomped by every current federal employee and military veteran out there.\n\n## Comment ID hm45dmz with +2 score by [(CandiedColoredClown, Reddit, 2021-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm45dmz/) (in reply to ID r1ynlc):\njust LinkedIn.

Or so I thought.\n\nThen, when I got hired at that company, my hiring manager explained to me that he hired me not because of my perceived understanding of their products, but because my skills and experience aligned with what they were looking for in that junior role. He then went on to explain to me that the applicant-facing product I had studied was just the tip of the iceberg because:\n\n1. **I only saw/experienced about 15% of this product.** The version of it I used appeared relatively static to me, as the user. But in reality, there was a lot of conditional logic on the back end that determined which questions I saw and which materials were required/optional/not asked based on things in my profile, the way I answered questions in other parts of the application, based on which type of device I accessed the application on, etc.\n2. **Though the most well-known product from this company was their applicant-facing product, there were about 6 other products that this UX role would be working on that were either B2B or strictly internal.** Things like configuration software, administration software, client support software, software for managing client implementations and integrations of our products, etc. etc. **There was essentially no (legal) way for me to have known that, nor to have accessed those products if I did somehow know that.**\n\nMy whole point with this lengthy comment is that you should be focusing (as the other commenters said) on how well your skill and experience align with what is being asked on the job description, and understand/expect that no matter how much time and work you put into getting to know a company's products, the reality of the situation is that you can never fully know until you work there how well you actually know their products.\n\n### Comment ID hqi12b6 with +1 score by [(Internet-Citizen, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqi12b6/) (in reply to ID hqhycbm):\nAnything for the UK?\n\n#### Comment ID hqi2sdi with +1 score by [(UXette, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqi2sdi/) (in reply to ID hqi12b6):\nDon't have anything, unfortunately\n\n#### Comment ID hqpn1jv with +1 score by [(UXette, Reddit, 2021-12-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqpn1jv/) (in reply to ID hqi12b6):\nThis site has a few UK postings: https://www.ideatelabs.co/job-board\n\n### Comment ID hqjqzpe with +1 score by [(Designflystretwerguy, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqjqzpe/) (in reply to ID hqhycbm):\nMdeng is a solid resource I would also follow him\nOn LinkedIn he promotes many internship and entry level roles.\n\n#### Comment ID i9djf1z with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/i9djf1z/) (in reply to ID hqjqzpe):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID hqixx6w with +10 score by [(TheComicSansKiller, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqixx6w/) (in reply to ID rroldx):\nFollow UXers on LinkedIn, leaders, managers, directors and so on.

Spamming resumes and applying to everything isn't a good general rule.  It isn't a good use of your time and it really gets you nowhere.  As someone who led a large design team and did over 70 interviews one year from hundreds of resumes, the carpet bombing approach might work for smaller startups but not for larger orgs.  You'll get lost in the noise.\n\nThat said, building connections is critical.  Make connections.  I don't mean spamming the connect button on LinkedIn, I mean sending a meaningful message - it will make you stand out.   You won't get a ton of replies but it makes you memorable.  Ideally not half assed but even half assed can be ok. So for instance sending a LinkedIn connection with the stock message = bad.  Sending one with a personal, unique but half-assed message = better.  Sending one with a hand tailored message that showed you researched the individual and their company = golden.\n\nSo for example, sending one that says \"hey, would love to connect, your experience with  doing UX for APIs is really interesting.\" is good.  Better is saying something like, \"Hey, would love to connect, your creation of a design system at YOURCOMPANY sounds really challenging, I've been studying how to improve communication of design tokens to designers and would love to chat about it with you some time.\"  This is why spamming doesn't work - start to get interested in specific things, take a deep dive - you don't have to commit to it for life but showing interest in a subject area makes you interesting to other people as well.

I have several people who applied for a senior position who weren’t qualified but may be ready for a junior position we could have opening.\n\n## Comment ID hqj7fv8 with +3 score by [(foxic95, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqj7fv8/) (in reply to ID rroldx):\nI got lucky by doing an internship at a government agency and getting a job there afterwards since i got my foot in the door already. So I don't know about the process of applying, but I can say that working for one has been very useful for learning. A government agency isn't driven by profit, so deadlines are lenient. They are also bound by their budget so they often can't afford the expensive senior designers, so I don't think it's uncommon for them to look for juniors, at least not in my country. Not all of them know about the benefits of UX though and might not be looking for one for that reason alone. However, having responsive and accessible websites is becoming more important for governments since excluding people with disabilities from a public service isn't legal. So it's not crazy to assume that some of them might be in dire need of some UX! Might be worth looking into.\n\n### Comment ID hqjnnqu with +2 score by [(DevelopMatt, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqjnnqu/) (in reply to ID hqj7fv8):\nNoted.

What I would emphasise is focus on creating a body of good work, and on top of that, networking, instead of cold applying  \n\n\nAll I had when I started was 1 *very good school project* that I worked my ass off on. When I say good I mean in the sense that \"client loved it, it got the highest possible grade, the professor wanted my group to write a paper about it\" - I made it the centerpiece of my portfolio when applied for an internship.  \n\n\nEnd of my first semester I saw a tweet from the head of a studio in my city while my exams were going on at my university, where I was studying my Master’s in Design. I was interested, so I looked a bit more at their website, and saw that they were a design studio that seemed working on some really cool problems!  \n\n\nI reached out to him with a sample of some work that I did and we had a call, where I wanted to learn more about the opportunities that were available.As I had my end of semester break, I realised that maybe I could come for 10 days as a quick “preview” and work on a small aspect of a problem. It would be a win-win situation. They would get some work that was of value to them, while I would gain experience and some stuff that would go on my portfolio (and be paid too)!  \n\n\nI proposed this over the call, and to my surprise and delight, he was interested. He discussed some projects they was working on, and later that day I sent a proposal outlining my various ideas for things that I could contribute to. I worked hard on the proposal, made a case for xyz thing and explained the different ideas I had.  \n\n\nI joined and impressed them enough that they called me back in the summer after my first year, and they offered me a job once my master's got over. I would have probably had zero luck had I waited till my master's was over and applied through their careers page, like everyone else.  \n\n\nI worked for a year there then they got battered by the pandemic so I went in-house at the ad-tech division of a tech company.\n\n### Comment ID hqplp60 with +1 score by [(DevelopMatt, Reddit, 2021-12-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqplp60/) (in reply to ID hqnf8ms):\nGreat story!

Until you have some experience under your belt all you can do is convey what you know and who you are as a person. I believe the best way to do that is still in person. I got my first few jobs in the industry by impressing people at meetups who then told their teams they should hire me. \n\nUnfortunately, the global pandemic makes that a lot harder these days but I would recommend looking up local meetup groups / industry happy hours and local chapters of of groups like IxDA, UXPA, etc. My local groups still do online events about once a month and occasionally do in person during the better Covid times. If there aren’t any in your area I would look into UX discord or slack channels.\n\n### Comment ID hqk7cnc with +1 score by [(DevelopMatt, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqk7cnc/) (in reply to ID hqk4osy):\nGreat points!

I got my current job by finding a company I wanted to work for, cold-emailing someone at the company who went to my same undergrad, and basically asked him for career advice. Did that like 10-15 times before it worked though.\n\nEdit: just wanted to add a couple of related pointers: (1) Any connection with the person will work. Doesn’t need to be that you went to the same college. Could be same hometown, etc. LinkedIn, Google (using the advanced search function), and company bios are your friends here. (2) Some jobs are posted even though the company already has a candidate in mind. Might be for DEI reasons, or maybe they want to say “we had 100 applicants apply for this one job!” This is where networking really helps out, because they might consider you before the job is even posted. (3) Job hunting is a numbers game. I literally applied to 84 jobs during my first search. Keep a spreadsheet to organize your search.\n\n### Comment ID k883u3z with +6 score by [(throwaway2929839392, Reddit, 2023-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/17pu8l3/other_than_indeed_where_do_yall_find_jobs_from/k883u3z/) (in reply to ID k87w4xz):\nWhat’s your industry?

FTS requires reindexing on every. single. write, so this additional load is certain to grind down your db performance - and that does not include the additional load of read queries originating from search. This penalty increases if search is tied to a large, customer facing application where users rely heavily on it for discovery.\n\nElastic is significantly more complex *to implement* but it offloads the operational and performance complexity to its own stack, which allows your prod db to focus solely on business logic - which actually makes the *overall* system design less complex, not more.\n\n### Comment ID jhqmx5j with +2 score by [(farsass, Reddit, 2023-04-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostgreSQL/comments/12yld1o/is_it_worth_using_postgres_builtin_fulltext/jhqmx5j/) (in reply to ID jhostv7):\n>FTS requires reindexing on every. single. write,\n\ndo you actually mean writing to an index instead of reindexing?\n\n#### Comment ID jhry8b0 with +2 score by [(Randommaggy, Reddit, 2023-04-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostgreSQL/comments/12yld1o/is_it_worth_using_postgres_builtin_fulltext/jhry8b0/) (in reply to ID jhqmx5j):\ngood FTS requires reevaluating the full set occasionally to not suck, at least it did when I last familiarized myself with the underlying theory.\n\n## Comment ID jhs8sy4 with +6 score by [(bhurt42, Reddit, 2023-04-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostgreSQL/comments/12yld1o/is_it_worth_using_postgres_builtin_fulltext/jhs8sy4/) (in reply to ID 12yld1o):\nIn my experience, most of the time when people say they need full text search, what they really want is just trigram search ([https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html)).   \n Now, there are valid use cases where elastic search is needed, but I think they're pretty rare.

This is because GIN indexes do not contain positional information.\n\nIf you need ranking, and you have the possibility to install PostgreSQL extensions, then you can consider an extension providing RUM indexes: [https://github.com/postgrespro/rum](https://github.com/postgrespro/rum). Otherwise, you'll have to use an \"external\" FTS engine like ElasticSearch.\n\nAnother possibility worth considering, if your dataset is not too large (a few GBs), or if it is shardable for example per customer, would be to use SQLite for everything, as it includes a very good built-in FTS engine.\n\n## Comment ID jhpt79s with +2 score by [(dkam, Reddit, 2023-04-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostgreSQL/comments/12yld1o/is_it_worth_using_postgres_builtin_fulltext/jhpt79s/) (in reply to ID 12yld1o):\nLike everyone here, use PG until you know you need something else.

If you're sticking with the open-source free version then none of that may matter. Amazon has their own branch of the search engine, too; you might look at that vs the Elastic version.\n\nElastic is also fairly big and has a whole ecosystem around it - Logstash, Kibana, etc. If you don't need those things, you may be adopting a suite you don't care about.\n\nAre you looking for a \"new stack\" as in starting from scratch and don't have a search tool?

List out everything you can think of...dimensions, door hardware soft close or not, brass or whatever, number of shelves, if they are permanent or adjustable pegs, trim type, backing or not, type of wood used, how many coats of primer/paint, etc. Attempt to clear up any chance for misunderstanding up front so it's not more painful later.\n\n## Comment ID k6lk6qm with +1 score by [(Opie_the_great, Reddit, 2023-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/17h295x/fair_quote_for_builtins/k6lk6qm/) (in reply to ID 17h295x):\nYou are very low. 7-8k.\n\n## Comment ID k6lkw7j with +1 score by [(akarlsen7, Reddit, 2023-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/17h295x/fair_quote_for_builtins/k6lkw7j/) (in reply to ID 17h295x):\nWe charge 300$ per foot for painted cabinets.

Also, a “strategy” role sounds more like a consultant role, which again, I would do as the leader of the whole company and wouldn’t rely on someone junior or an expensive outside consultant to do. As for analyst, there’s probably plenty of those roles, but analyst needs to mean analytics in this regard- writing code, an Excel pro, or some very specific industry expertise that allows you to be more than a generalist analyst.\n\nDefinitely need to shoot for bigger orgs for those titles. Being in from the ground up with those skills means you need to know someone, like a family member, or take an internship title, which means lower pay for the experience and hope to work well enough and the startup to have enough budget to want you full-time within a matter of months.

You could target a more specific and related role like product management, sales ops, or project management.   The need for these roles begin in smaller companies when they have about 5 developers or 5 sales people and become more important as the company gets larger teams that require more coordination.   Otherwise if you want to be a business analyst, you need a pretty big company and it’s probably going to be financially related position.

I tried LinkedIn, but most jobs posted over 24 hours ago have 200+ applicants. It’s frustrating.

Connect with as many people as possible. Having a wider network makes it easier for you to come up in recruiter searches.\n2. Make sure you profile is properly filled in with all the info. More keywords in job descriptions and the \"about me\" section help you come up in recruiter searches.\n3. Make sure you're \"open to work\".\n4. Reply to every recruiter message, even if it's to say \"I don't think this is for me, but if you have xyz I'd be interested in hearing about it\". Replying more puts you higher up in the recruiter searches.\n5. Use the title feature to go with your name for things like \"software dev | framework | yoe\" etc. so people can quickly see what you do (though obviously you can only put a small amount of info here).\n6. I assume that getting skill badges helps. Same with if you can get friends/colleagues to validate your skills too.\n\nObviously there are no guarantees, but this is what I understand to be the things that helps ensure you come up higher in recruiter searches.\n\nIt's\n\n### Comment ID j6iqug5 with +1 score by [(SeeJaneCode, Reddit, 2023-01-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/10oi5sk/where_do_you_all_go_to_find_jobs/j6iqug5/) (in reply to ID j6f3noe):\nThis is the way.

I don’t have any inside info about that so I’m just guessing they have some software that alerts them when previous applicants become ripe at that 3 year milestone.\n\n### Comment ID j6f8iyy with +2 score by [(ID4gotten, Reddit, 2023-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/10oi5sk/where_do_you_all_go_to_find_jobs/j6f8iyy/) (in reply to ID j6ew44e):\nAnd where do you find real ones vs the spam/scammers that are everywhere?\n\n#### Comment ID j6fr1wu with +12 score by [(delphinius81, Reddit, 2023-01-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/10oi5sk/where_do_you_all_go_to_find_jobs/j6fr1wu/) (in reply to ID j6f8iyy):\nIf they are pitching a job that doesn't sound remotely like it matches your job history or tech experience, it's spam.\n\nLike, I have 0 web dev experience, but since I have a bullet point on my resume with the word REST, I get spammed with web dev things all the time.\n\nYou just get a feel for the good ones.\n\n#### Comment ID j6i6j1i with +1 score by [(RedFlounder7, Reddit, 2023-01-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/10oi5sk/where_do_you_all_go_to_find_jobs/j6i6j1i/) (in reply to ID j6f8iyy):\nAre you getting a lot of scammers in this space?

Job posting sites do work, but as you've noted, it can be a serious uphill battle considering how many people use those sites. The numbers are just not in your favor. Through networking, though, you can potentially find positions that aren't easily findable by the public as well as stand out from the crowd through your reference.\n\nYou've even seen this first hand:\n\n>I am interviewing with one company, but I am very much a special case with them: they found one of my personal projects and reached out because they are doing the same thing — though they were hiring for a senior position for a framework with which I don’t have experience.\n\nYou getting that interview was effectively the result of your (passive) networking. Those kinds of opportunities exist all the time, the problem is finding them. By communicating with relevant people, you're searching for these kinds of opportunities more actively. Even if this specific interview doesn't work out for you, they're going to know who you are and what you can do, meaning if they later find a position for you (either with them or for someone else), you're name will be on the top of their list.\n\nThere's a lot to be said about how to effectively network, but I think it's just important to be aware that it's not just an answer, but it's *the* answer. Even using job posting sites can be thought of as a really cheap, but ineffective, way to network. The thing about it is that it takes effort, and you get out what you put in. So if you just go set yourself to \"looking for work\" on LinkedIn and casual check out Indeed, you're not gonna get as many leads as someone who's trying to talk with people, understand what others are looking for, and generally putting themselves out there.\n\nAs far as things being time-sensitive, that's tough. Networking inherently builds on itself and takes time, so the best time to do it is before you need it. Regardless, I'd say finding another contract may be the quickest solution to at least buy more time, although it's not like it's *much* easier. My advice about networking still applies, but I suppose you'd have to be pretty aggressive with your approach if you're trying to get a job ASAP. Reach out to people you know, search for companies that may want to hire you and contact someone relevant directly, and keep trying to expose yourself (and your credentials) to as many people as possible. Also doesn't hurt to do the LinkedIn/Indeed/etc. routine and talk to recruiters as well.\n\n### Comment ID j6i8dwu with +2 score by [(mosselyn, Reddit, 2023-01-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/10oi5sk/where_do_you_all_go_to_find_jobs/j6i8dwu/) (in reply to ID j6ezemn):\nYeah, every single job I got in my 35 year career, except for my first one out of school, was through networking.

I was a shoe-in for the position compared to the other juniors straight out of Uni with little to no experience. I had also been coding since I was 12.

Yeeeeuuuuppp. It is by no means fair in this very real world.\n\nI say this to set the bar for what you will be up against. Nepotism is real. Favoritism is real. Connections and networking are real. If you want a solid job, you need to network and do it early, often, and always. Success is made through relationships. Skill and capability come secondary.\n\nThe only caveat to my advice would be if you are truly exceptional.

I have friends that didn’t do this and went on vacations during the summer and started applying in september and still can’t find a jobz\n\n## Comment ID iwwsfrn with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yyp8yk/is_linkedin_the_best_site_for_finding_jobs_in_our/iwwsfrn/) (in reply to ID yyp8yk):\nLinkedIn imo has the best matching algorithm. But I never apply on LinkedIn I go to the company jobs site and have had great success rate.\n\n## Comment ID iwzfvwk with +4 score by [(actual_satan, Reddit, 2022-11-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yyp8yk/is_linkedin_the_best_site_for_finding_jobs_in_our/iwzfvwk/) (in reply to ID yyp8yk):\nAnecdotal/personal take here - LinkedIn is trash. There's tons of better ways to search and find jobs for Software engineers. Try out [Triplebyte](https://triplebyte.com), it's targeted directly at software engineers. There's also [Handshake](https://joinhandshake.com/) which is good for College students.\n\n## Comment ID ix175kp with +2 score by [(OkResponsibility2470, Reddit, 2022-11-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yyp8yk/is_linkedin_the_best_site_for_finding_jobs_in_our/ix175kp/) (in reply to ID yyp8yk):\nLinkedIn is probably the worst for random applications, its only saving grace is being able to connect with recruiters directly\n\n\n\n## Comment ID iwwbvtk with +1 score by [(Ultimarr, Reddit, 2022-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yyp8yk/is_linkedin_the_best_site_for_finding_jobs_in_our/iwwbvtk/) (in reply to ID yyp8yk):\nIn terms of an application portal, it's about the same as indeed. In terms of a place to mark yourself as open to work and get recruiters to reach out to you, it's amazing. A recruiter got me my current MAGMA job before I even started applying elsewhere in earnest, all from LinkedIn.\n\nPersonally I'd be applying to jobs on Piazza before I tried Glassdoor lol, but that's just bias\n\n## Comment ID iwwgx9u with +1 score by [(PapaMurphy2000, Reddit, 2022-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yyp8yk/is_linkedin_the_best_site_for_finding_jobs_in_our/iwwgx9u/) (in reply to ID yyp8yk):\nDepends. If all you did is apply randomly to every job post, then it’s no better than any other job board.\n\nIf you use it to foster relationships, then absolutely.\n\n## Comment ID iwworz6 with +1 score by [(riddleadmiral, Reddit, 2022-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yyp8yk/is_linkedin_the_best_site_for_finding_jobs_in_our/iwworz6/) (in reply to ID yyp8yk):\nI got 5 offers last time I was searching for jobs, literally every single one was a recruiter reaching out to me via LinkedIn. \n\nI had applied to literally 0 of those roles myself.\n\n### Comment ID iwx8kkg with +1 score by [(Drawer-Vegetable, Reddit, 2022-11-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yyp8yk/is_linkedin_the_best_site_for_finding_jobs_in_our/iwx8kkg/) (in reply to ID iwworz6):\nInternal recruiters or external 3rd party ones ?\n\n## Comment ID iwwpr7m with +1 score by [(Whitchorence, Reddit, 2022-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yyp8yk/is_linkedin_the_best_site_for_finding_jobs_in_our/iwwpr7m/) (in reply to ID yyp8yk):\nYes, though if you have connections that's also a great route rather than blindly blasting out resumes\n\n## Comment ID iwwrivf with +1 score by [(lifting_and_coding, Reddit, 2022-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yyp8yk/is_linkedin_the_best_site_for_finding_jobs_in_our/iwwrivf/) (in reply to ID yyp8yk):\nI found LinkedIn to be the best by a long shot\n\n## Comment ID iwxslaz with +1 score by [(Azure125, Reddit, 2022-11-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yyp8yk/is_linkedin_the_best_site_for_finding_jobs_in_our/iwxslaz/) (in reply to ID yyp8yk):\nI found both of my jobs on Indeed.

Do prepare yourself to be contacted by billions of other recruiters who will contact you about jobs that are very obviously not suitable though."

Toxic culture lead by toxic higher ups. 4 layoffs (maybe 5 now with a new one January 2024 that I saw...) and each time there was zero sympathy or explanation. Instead, each layoff added pressure to current employees who then had to triple their work load for no additional pay. One time I heard the CEO tell people in the office that they should get back to work, when they were talking about an INTERNAL committee they were on and tasked with. The office is a graveyard with a requirement to come in even though 90% of the desks are empty and one half of the office doesn't even have the lights on anymore. I hate office days because it is eerily quiet and the days are depressing. CEO and VPs are the definition of toxic. They are always on expensive vacations abroad while everyone else is worked to the bone, and the \"unlimited PTO/ half day Fridays\" are a joke. I never get to take a half day on a Friday because of the added work load, and hands get slapped if you take a day off even if it is for mental health. \n\nDEI is nonexistent.\n\nI do not see the culture or anything about the company improving because the same VPs and higher ups are always safe, who are truly causing the issues. They should be embarrassed but their egos are too big to ever feel that way. \n\nAlso base pay is a joke compared to any other company.",

          "cons": "While working here as a senior team member, I discovered I was paid less than new hires in junior roles, despite consistently being recognized as a top performer. I was also “quiet hired” to take on additional responsibilities without a raise or promotion. It was very discouraging to discover that Built In is engaged in the very practices it publicly preaches against. \n\nThe work-life balance was terrible. I worked until 10 or 11 most nights and most weekends, too. This was common on my team. We had to keep up with unreasonable KPIs while leaders resisted our attempts to improve processes. \n\nMany of the perks are mostly performative. If you want to use a wellness day to recover from burnout, you have to scramble twice as hard to get set up for your absence. Half-day Fridays are cool in theory, except the majority of my team worked Friday afternoons anyway to keep up with unreasonable workloads. Unlimited PTO apparently does have limits, a colleague was once told that they shouldn’t take more than ~13 days, and it is possible to get written up for “excessive PTO.” \n\nSo the company loves to dangle these perks as differentiators when they lack meaning in practice.\n\nThere have been four layoffs since October 2022. Two public RIFs, a quiet restructuring, and a more recent silent layoff where remaining employees only found out through LinkedIn posts from their impacted colleagues. Despite the writing on the wall, the leadership remains toxically positive, bordering on delusion. At all-hands meetings, the CEO espouses a hustle mentality, insinuating that the grind and a positive attitude will pay off for everyone (except those who were laid off, obviously) and that the company is winning. I’ll never forget when – a few days after the second RIF – the company kicked off the next all-hands with upbeat pop music and the CEO telling the remaining staff to stay off LinkedIn because it was too depressing.\n\nI’m sure there will be a careful response to this review, as there is on all of the others. So I'll proactively say, in regards to pay transparency that would have addressed my pay disparity, the company said \"they were working on it\" for 2 years and eventually rolled out a disappointing, opaque process. And ultimately, they can’t say anything to change my experience – but I’m one of the few who got off easy. Many others are afraid to post their honest accounts of working at Built In out of concern for the NDA signed in exchange for severance during the many layoffs. \n\nMy advice to jobseekers considering a job here? Do NOT buy into the gospel or sacrifice yourself. Negotiate the heck out of your job offer and always remember: you are disposable.",

It's for people who are hungry, and that's probably the biggest pro we've got.\r\n\r\nThe team at Built In, regardless of department, is a fervent entrepreneurial set. That makes sense, since our primary goal is to help companies grow and prosper. But it's also good news internally: We're growing like crazy and have sky-high goals, and we come in each and every day eager to build, rather than celebrate yesterday’s successes (and there are plenty). Every player on the team is passionate, forward-thinking, collaborative, humble — and working first and foremost toward what’s best for the company. \r\n\r\nEven still, that mentality unlocks plenty of professional growth. In my three-plus years at Built In, I have watched my peers grow into outstanding leaders of the company. I’ve cheered them on as they’ve chased new opportunities and tackled increasingly larger challenges, and they’ve done the same for me. And every new member of every single team has just as much opportunity to step up in a similar fashion. \r\n\r\nSo, yeah, Built In isn’t for everybody. But for those of us who prefer to keep those sleeves rolled up, you couldn’t ask for a more fulfilling place to work — or a better team to do it with.",

Our goal is to give managers the tools to help grow and develop their teams. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to diversity, we are proud to report that over 57% of our population identify as women, which is a rare achievement in Tech. Moreover, over 55% of all managers identify as women, too. \r\n\r\nThat said, we recognize we have work to do but we are committed to improving DEI at Built In. This year, we made additional investments towards recruiting folks from historically underrepresented groups in tech. Also, we now have a dedicated Senior Director, DEI who is responsible for the creation and delivery of our DEI Roadmap. The DEI Roadmap is shared with both our Board and our employees, to increase transparency and accountability. We encourage you to reach out to our Senior Director, DEI with any recommendations on how you think we can make improvements and we look forward to sharing results from 2022 in Q4 and unveiling our 2023 roadmap early next year.",

While we are proud of our gender diversity (&gt;50% of our employees identify as women), we recognize we still have work to do to increase our intersectional representation across the business and have initiatives in place within our roadmap to accomplish this goal. \r\n\r\nRegarding our Leadership team, we care deeply about career development at Built In and are grateful that 3 of our 12 (25%) leaders have begun their careers with us as individual contributors and over their tenure have grown into VPs. That said, 75% of our leadership team have 10-15+ years of external experience across Growth, Enterprise, and Fortune 500 companies. \r\n\r\nCommitment to transparent communications is one of the top priorities of our leadership team, which is why we conduct a monthly company-wide meeting to ensure our employees are looped in to our top strategic initiatives and happenings across the business. We encourage employees to submit questions for our Q&amp;A portion of that meeting to ensure they have answers to any outstanding questions and are informed on the topics that are important to them. In addition, we have invested in training for all managers focused on feedback and coaching - it is our expectation that feedback is continuous and based on observable behaviors.

          "cons": "I witnessed deceptive and unprincipled practices by upper management and HR on numerous occasions. In particular, Built In's regular practice of bribing people who are leaving to sign a non-disparagement agreement in order to get severance pay should stop you—a person reading Glassdoor reviews—in your tracks. I refused to sign, even though they offered me a month's salary to do so, which is why I am legally able to leave this review. Think about all the people who got laid off (1/4 of their workforce in fall 2022 alone) who needed that money and decided to sign. You're not hearing from them here, which radically juices the company's ratings as an employer. Core values are not taken seriously by leadership. I regularly tried to lead with solutions by \"poking holes and offering ideas to patch them up,\" as they like to say, and was told to put my head down and keep these thoughts to myself. Even easy-to-implement fixes that everyone could agree on were regularly sidelined due politics or personalities. People who don't take the hint here are asked to resign or laid off at the first opportunity. Content leaders don't believe in the expertise of content creators and do not want them to \"do more.\" Despite being told when I was hired that they were looking for someone who would bring new ideas, strategies and processes to the team, they really wanted a cog in a machine who would shovel content through the mill, not someone interested in raising—or even maintaining—quality or standards. DEI at Built In is all talk and no action. As a hiring manager, I struggled to diversify our very homogeneous team, but the candidate pool was very white and male in every one of the 9 or so hires I was directly involved in. I asked HR for help in expanding this pool and they refused, telling me I needed to come up with my own strategies to expand the applicant pool because they were too busy to offer support. Several candidates of color made it to the final round, only to be denied by leaders or HR for not passing the personality test they make candidates take or not having the right disposition, look or \"culture fit.\" In fact, it was an open secret (on my team, at least) that HR is pretty much useless after you're onboarded. Every time I reached out with a \"people team\" issue, HR would take days or weeks to even respond. I repeatedly had to follow up on my own emails just to get a response! The eventual reply was usually to cut and paste sections of the handbook (that I'd obviously already read) or send URLs to outside advice articles (that they'd already asked managers to read). Then they would schedule follow-up meetings with me to see what I had done to fix the issue on my own, filling up my already stuffed calendar with garbage check-ins to clear themselves of accountability. I've literally never had to deal with a less valuable HR group in my nearly two decades in the professional workforce. I witnessed first-hand multiple occasions of the content studio team being undermined or stabbed in the back by petty managers and leaders on the news team and thrown under the bus by a leaderless sales team. I personally tried to create bonds between these teams to create some empathy between them, but eventually gave up in disgust.",

While we can’t address each of your comments effectively in this forum, we do want to touch on a few of them. \r\n \r\nFirst, we echo your kudos for our writers – we agree wholeheartedly that they are talented, passionate, and hardworking!  We are also pleased to hear that you feel you were able to achieve a healthy work-life balance during your time with us.  This is critically important to the leaders of our organization at every level. We were also glad to hear that you found value in the manager training options provided by the People Team, ranging from our Manager CORE training from LifeLabs to our introduction of Paradigm Reach, an on-demand DEI learning tool. \r\n \r\nWe do take exception to your comment that requesting a non-disparagement covenant as a condition of receiving severance pay is somehow inappropriate. Please know that it’s standard practice to include a severance pay offer in a standard separation agreement containing customary terms and conditions, including a non-disparagement covenant.  \r\nWe acknowledge your concern regarding our lack of diversity.  We recognize that we still have work to do and we are working on strategies to diversify the applicant pool so that we can continue our initiative to improve DEI at Built In.\r\n \r\nFinally, we are proud of our managers (especially the individual who managed you during your employment with us), who encourage a variety of opinions and discourse, as well as our HR team for being responsive to the questions and viewpoints of our team. We are disappointed to learn that you feel your ideas were not given appropriate attention. It’s important to us that everyone feels valued for the contributions they bring to work every day!\r\n \r\nWe would like the opportunity to further explore your concerns now that we are aware of them, and we encourage you to reach out any time to our People Team.

We are glad to hear that during your time at Built In you experienced the passion and drive of the leadership team, while also having fun! \r\n\r\nAlmost all companies, including Built In, have been impacted by the unpredictable market dynamics. This has caused us to take a close look at our own organization.  It is our responsibility to ensure that our company continues to stay strong. Like most companies, we re-forecasted and our Sales reps have a clear path to attainment. \r\n \r\nWith that goal in mind, we were faced with challenging decisions. In October, we made the difficult decision to implement a workforce reduction that impacted 23% of our employees. \r\n \r\nThis was an incredibly hard decision and one that we hoped we would never need to make.  When looking at the impact on the business as a result of this economic downturn, we needed to evaluate current staffing levels and bring them into alignment with the reality of our business needs. Our goal is to make the transition for affected employees as smooth as possible. To do that, every affected employee was offered severance pay, continuation coverage under our health insurance and Modern Health benefits through the end of November, and the ability to keep their company-issued laptop for their job search.",

There is a mean girls, tribe mentality that forces out anyone with real experience. This results in a chaotic strategy and magical thinking. The CEO is convinced that the product is an enterprise offering, but it cannot support large companies. There is also a push to move internationally before the product provides value in US markets.\r\n\r\nExperienced leaders turn over quickly and then they are blamed for the failings of the company. It's a burnout factory where the CEO can't stand it if someone else's ideas are successful. Once you challenge, you are pushed out.\r\n\r\nThe senior sales team is comprised of some of inexperienced sales people who are friends with leadership. \r\n\r\nThe product is old technology and poorly integrated across sites. There is enough technical debt to cripple the platform, but it is never addressed because they are always pursuing shiny objects with no proof that there is market need for the solution.\r\n\r\nPoor planning, lack of strategy and, copycat mentality have resulted in four layoffs over the past 2 years. Even when they promise that it will be the last.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of talk about the company being people first and valuing diversity. It's lip service.\r\n\r\nIf you want to just show up and agree with the leadership, you'll do fine. If you want to get anything done or make an impact, look elsewhere.",

On the opposite, I wanted to input my experience at Built In since it has been nothing but awesome. In the past I have worked for some bad (and I mean bad) companies who truly do not care about their employees. When joining Built In I saw a whole different world than what I was used to. Employee success, culture, wellness, and actual happiness are at the forefront of how Built In treats their employees regardless of the market. I can honestly say I ENJOY working each day, and so do those around me. Keeping a good attitude and drive during a rough market is hard to do and not for everyone, but I am surrounded by people who genuinely care which is so cool. I am excited to keep pushing through together and see what we can do next as a team!",

Please know that we do read these, share with leadership, and work collaboratively to make appropriate improvements based on these insights.\r\n\r\nBuilt In has always operated with a people-first mindset, and we agree that there are great, hard working, caring employees who make Built In what it is.\r\n\r\nLike many others, Built In has been impacted by today’s market and the macro economics surrounding the industry. To those employees who were impacted by layoffs, we offered competitive packages, provided resume and interviewing coaching, and offered personal introductions to companies who are hiring. \r\n\r\nWe are doing our best to navigate this new normal and make decisions in the best interest of our people as well as the business.For example, we encourage all of our leaders to manage their teams independently, while cohesively operating under unified values and business practices. What works for one team may not work for another. Which is why we’ve introduced a Flex Work Policy for all of our employees. We offer both Flex Mode and Remote Mode, where you may have the opportunity to work remotely based on your role and function - or enjoy the perks of being in the office on a hybrid schedule. Some departments may choose to designate additional in-office days, but our philosophy is to encourage flexibility to support personal work styles while balancing business needs.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to our leadership, we are proud to have a leadership team with an average tenure of 7.75 years. When you have a group of individuals who work together for that long, it’s natural that friendships form and we’re proud of the deep trust this team has in each other. It allows us to move fast, be innovative, and have deep alignment with our strategic initiatives. The leaders who we’ve brought on board over the last 1-2 years came in for growth and those leaders are not always the type of leaders who can operate in market downturns.  We’re proud of the leaders we have in place and their commitment to supporting and empowering our people is unwavering. \r\n\r\nIf you have additional questions or other concerns you’d like us to address - please feel free to get in touch directly!",

Not even counting the numerous 'Director' level positions that have come and gone. Look into median (instead of average) tenure of leadership positions. -Siloed functions. Teams don't work together within their functions, nor do they collaborate across functions. What is product working on? No idea because a product roadmap is not communicated broadly. -Culture. Toxic, plain and simple. Watch out for the most tenured employees, especially in sales and up to the founder and cofounder. Either get in line or prepare to be ostracized. Leading with solutions is a value, but only if it jives with the CEO's agenda. Otherwise, speaking up will mark you for a PIP or for layoffs. -Career progression. Ask HR, there has been a plan for career laddering the last 3 years with no implementation. DE&amp;I is a facade and the team should spend more time focusing on improving culture, community, and investigating employee concerns rather than vanity metrics or responding to these reviews.",

Like most tech companies, we were impacted by the most recent market downturn and experienced the need to downsize some of our sales team members. We are in an economic climate that demands constant change of organizations, and our leadership team is dedicated to the success of our people as we emerge stronger than ever before. We continue to invest in developing as people-leaders, as the success of any organization is deeply rooted in the satisfaction and well-being of its employees. \n\nWe take pride in our offerings, and we are disappointed to hear that you found them subpar. We are constantly working to enhance our products and services, and have invested heavily in these by bringing in a Chief Technology Officer and doubling down on R&amp;D to get us to a spot to go international in the near future. We are pleased to say that our products will continue to be enhanced in our pursuit of delivering top results to our tech visitors and customers. \n\nIf you are open to it, we would appreciate the opportunity to discuss your concerns in more detail and gather additional insights that can help us address specific issues. You can reach out directly to our CEO or to our Head of People at any time.  We take all feedback seriously, and your insights are invaluable as we continuously strive to improve our organization.",

We only wish you would have done so while you were employed with us, as we would have appreciated the opportunity to address these issues directly with you.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to be an organization built and led by women. Individuals who identify as women account for 58% of our employee population, 55% of all managers and 53% of our leadership team. \r\n\r\nWe conducted our first annual anonymous DEI survey in Q4 of 2021 and across the board, women rated our company more favorably than their peers. For example, participants who identified as women gave the following ratings:\r\n- 96% favorability for “I feel respected at Built In,” \r\n- 91% favorability for “I feel like I belong at Built In,”\r\n- 87% favorability for “At Built In there is open and honest two-way communication” \r\n- 81% favorable for “I can voice a contrary opinion without fear of negative consequences” \r\nWe’re disappointed that you don’t feel you had a similar experience while you were employed with us.\r\n\r\nWe take the safety and wellbeing of our employees very seriously. We conduct annual harassment prevention training for all employees and recently invested in a platform that is trauma-informed, trigger free, and provides the most marginalized individuals with additional resources. \r\n\r\nWe have a longstanding written anti-harassment policy that provides multiple reporting avenues.  Again, we wish you had utilized our policy and brought your concerns to our attention during your employment with us, as we would have followed our outlined protocol by asking you to provide the facts underlying your concerns and promptly investigating those concerns. \r\n\r\nWe would like the opportunity to investigate your concerns now that you have made us aware of them, so we encourage you to reach out directly to any member of our People Team so that we can obtain the additional information we need in order to do so.  Thank you again.\r\n\r\nWe’re surprised to hear your comment about a lack of diversity. While we recognize that we have work to do and we are committed to fulfilling the commitments of our annual DEI roadmap, we can confirm that every department in our company has diverse representation.",

We’re so glad that you felt connected to your teammates and the people around you. \r\n\r\nAs a recruitment marketing platform, our customers often reside in HR &amp; Talent positions. We have seen great success in hiring folks from the staffing world as they deeply understand our buyer persona and our industry as a whole! That said, Built In has always been committed to hiring top talent, and prioritizes both diversity of thought and experience - especially for roles that manage people.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to build long lasting teams with inspired leaders, and we are proud to share that our employees have an overall average tenure of 3.1 years, with Management at an average tenure of 4.4 Years. Specifically on our Account Management team the average employee tenure is 3.4 years, with a management tenure of 4.9 years. This is well above the industry average, which is something we are incredibly proud of.\r\n\r\nRegarding our Revenue infrastructure, we endeavor to set our teams up for optimal success, and recognize there are always areas for improvement. While we absolutely make mistakes, we make what we believe to be the best decisions based on the information we had at that time. Most importantly, those decisions and changes are always well-intentioned with the Account Manager and customer as the priority. However, what worked years ago, does not always continue to be the best approach. The past 12 months forced us to move swiftly related to territories/books, commission structure and we’re proud of the changes we’ve made in the positive direction the past 6 months to allow for a more equitable and predictable environment.\r\n\r\nThanks again for sharing your thoughts. If you have any additional feedback or suggestions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.",

That makes sense, since our primary goal is to help companies grow and prosper. But it's also good news internally: We're growing like crazy and have sky-high goals, and we come in each and every day eager to build, rather than celebrate yesterday’s successes (and there are plenty). Every player on the team is passionate, forward-thinking, collaborative, humble — and working first and foremost toward what’s best for the company. \r\n\r\nEven still, that mentality unlocks plenty of professional growth. In my three-plus years at Built In, I have watched my peers grow into outstanding leaders of the company. I’ve cheered them on as they’ve chased new opportunities and tackled increasingly larger challenges, and they’ve done the same for me. And every new member of every single team has just as much opportunity to step up in a similar fashion. \r\n\r\nSo, yeah, Built In isn’t for everybody.

In particular, Built In's regular practice of bribing people who are leaving to sign a non-disparagement agreement in order to get severance pay should stop you—a person reading Glassdoor reviews—in your tracks. I refused to sign, even though they offered me a month's salary to do so, which is why I am legally able to leave this review. Think about all the people who got laid off (1/4 of their workforce in fall 2022 alone) who needed that money and decided to sign. You're not hearing from them here, which radically juices the company's ratings as an employer. Core values are not taken seriously by leadership. I regularly tried to lead with solutions by \"poking holes and offering ideas to patch them up,\" as they like to say, and was told to put my head down and keep these thoughts to myself. Even easy-to-implement fixes that everyone could agree on were regularly sidelined due politics or personalities. People who don't take the hint here are asked to resign or laid off at the first opportunity. Content leaders don't believe in the expertise of content creators and do not want them to \"do more.\" Despite being told when I was hired that they were looking for someone who would bring new ideas, strategies and processes to the team, they really wanted a cog in a machine who would shovel content through the mill, not someone interested in raising—or even maintaining—quality or standards. DEI at Built In is all talk and no action. As a hiring manager, I struggled to diversify our very homogeneous team, but the candidate pool was very white and male in every one of the 9 or so hires I was directly involved in. I asked HR for help in expanding this pool and they refused, telling me I needed to come up with my own strategies to expand the applicant pool because they were too busy to offer support. Several candidates of color made it to the final round, only to be denied by leaders or HR for not passing the personality test they make candidates take or not having the right disposition, look or \"culture fit.\" In fact, it was an open secret (on my team, at least) that HR is pretty much useless after you're onboarded. Every time I reached out with a \"people team\" issue, HR would take days or weeks to even respond. I repeatedly had to follow up on my own emails just to get a response! The eventual reply was usually to cut and paste sections of the handbook (that I'd obviously already read) or send URLs to outside advice articles (that they'd already asked managers to read). Then they would schedule follow-up meetings with me to see what I had done to fix the issue on my own, filling up my already stuffed calendar with garbage check-ins to clear themselves of accountability. I've literally never had to deal with a less valuable HR group in my nearly two decades in the professional workforce. I witnessed first-hand multiple occasions of the content studio team being undermined or stabbed in the back by petty managers and leaders on the news team and thrown under the bus by a leaderless sales team. I personally tried to create bonds between these teams to create some empathy between them, but eventually gave up in disgust.",

Not even counting the numerous 'Director' level positions that have come and gone. Look into median (instead of average) tenure of leadership positions. -Siloed functions. Teams don't work together within their functions, nor do they collaborate across functions. What is product working on? No idea because a product roadmap is not communicated broadly. -Culture. Toxic, plain and simple. Watch out for the most tenured employees, especially in sales and up to the founder and cofounder. Either get in line or prepare to be ostracized. Leading with solutions is a value, but only if it jives with the CEO's agenda. Otherwise, speaking up will mark you for a PIP or for layoffs. -Career progression. Ask HR, there has been a plan for career laddering the last 3 years with no implementation.

        "cons": "While working here as a senior team member, I discovered I was paid less than new hires in junior roles, despite consistently being recognized as a top performer. I was also “quiet hired” to take on additional responsibilities without a raise or promotion. It was very discouraging to discover that Built In is engaged in the very practices it publicly preaches against. \n\nThe work-life balance was terrible. I worked until 10 or 11 most nights and most weekends, too. This was common on my team. We had to keep up with unreasonable KPIs while leaders resisted our attempts to improve processes. \n\nMany of the perks are mostly performative. If you want to use a wellness day to recover from burnout, you have to scramble twice as hard to get set up for your absence. Half-day Fridays are cool in theory, except the majority of my team worked Friday afternoons anyway to keep up with unreasonable workloads. Unlimited PTO apparently does have limits, a colleague was once told that they shouldn’t take more than ~13 days, and it is possible to get written up for “excessive PTO.” \n\nSo the company loves to dangle these perks as differentiators when they lack meaning in practice.\n\nThere have been four layoffs since October 2022. Two public RIFs, a quiet restructuring, and a more recent silent layoff where remaining employees only found out through LinkedIn posts from their impacted colleagues. Despite the writing on the wall, the leadership remains toxically positive, bordering on delusion. At all-hands meetings, the CEO espouses a hustle mentality, insinuating that the grind and a positive attitude will pay off for everyone (except those who were laid off, obviously) and that the company is winning. I’ll never forget when – a few days after the second RIF – the company kicked off the next all-hands with upbeat pop music and the CEO telling the remaining staff to stay off LinkedIn because it was too depressing.\n\nI’m sure there will be a careful response to this review, as there is on all of the others. So I'll proactively say, in regards to pay transparency that would have addressed my pay disparity, the company said \"they were working on it\" for 2 years and eventually rolled out a disappointing, opaque process. And ultimately, they can’t say anything to change my experience – but I’m one of the few who got off easy. Many others are afraid to post their honest accounts of working at Built In out of concern for the NDA signed in exchange for severance during the many layoffs. \n\nMy advice to jobseekers considering a job here? Do NOT buy into the gospel or sacrifice yourself. Negotiate the heck out of your job offer and always remember: you are disposable.",

Instead, each layoff added pressure to current employees who then had to triple their work load for no additional pay. One time I heard the CEO tell people in the office that they should get back to work, when they were talking about an INTERNAL committee they were on and tasked with. The office is a graveyard with a requirement to come in even though 90% of the desks are empty and one half of the office doesn't even have the lights on anymore. I hate office days because it is eerily quiet and the days are depressing. CEO and VPs are the definition of toxic. They are always on expensive vacations abroad while everyone else is worked to the bone, and the \"unlimited PTO/ half day Fridays\" are a joke. I never get to take a half day on a Friday because of the added work load, and hands get slapped if you take a day off even if it is for mental health. \n\nDEI is nonexistent.\n\nI do not see the culture or anything about the company improving because the same VPs and higher ups are always safe, who are truly causing the issues. They should be embarrassed but their egos are too big to ever feel that way. \n\nAlso base pay is a joke compared to any other company.",

There is a mean girls, tribe mentality that forces out anyone with real experience. This results in a chaotic strategy and magical thinking. The CEO is convinced that the product is an enterprise offering, but it cannot support large companies. There is also a push to move internationally before the product provides value in US markets.\r\n\r\nExperienced leaders turn over quickly and then they are blamed for the failings of the company. It's a burnout factory where the CEO can't stand it if someone else's ideas are successful. Once you challenge, you are pushed out.\r\n\r\nThe senior sales team is comprised of some of inexperienced sales people who are friends with leadership. \r\n\r\nThe product is old technology and poorly integrated across sites. There is enough technical debt to cripple the platform, but it is never addressed because they are always pursuing shiny objects with no proof that there is market need for the solution.\r\n\r\nPoor planning, lack of strategy and, copycat mentality have resulted in four layoffs over the past 2 years. Even when they promise that it will be the last.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of talk about the company being people first and valuing diversity.

      "# [Introducing Instagram Teen Accounts: Built-In Protections for Teens, Peace of Mind for Parents by Meta, Facebook company on 2024-09-17](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/instagram-teen-accounts/)\nToday, we’re introducing Instagram Teen Accounts, a new experience for teens, guided by parents. Teen Accounts have built-in protections which limit who can contact them and the content they see, and also provide new ways for teens to explore their interests. We’ll automatically place teens into Teen Accounts, and teens under 16 will need a parent’s permission to change any of these settings to be less strict.\n\nReimagining Teens’ Experiences on Instagram\n\nWe know parents want to feel confident that their teens can use social media to connect with their friends and explore their interests, without having to worry about unsafe or inappropriate experiences. We understand parents’ concerns, and that’s why we’re reimagining our apps for teens with new Teen Accounts. This new experience is designed to better support parents, and give them peace of mind that their teens are safe with the right protections in place. Teens will also get access to a new feature, made just for them, that lets them select topics they want to see more of in Explore and their recommendations so they can focus on the fun, positive content they love.\n\nBuilt-In Protections To Address Parents’ Top Concerns\n\nWe developed Teen Accounts with parents and teens in mind. The new Teen Account protections are designed to address parents’ biggest concerns, including who their teens are talking to online, the content they’re seeing and whether their time is being well spent. These protections are turned on automatically, and parents decide if teens under 16 can change any of these settings to be less strict:\n\nPrivate accounts: With default private accounts, teens need to accept new followers and people who don’t follow them can’t see their content or interact with them. This applies to all teens under 16 (including those already on Instagram and those signing up) and teens under 18 when they sign up for the app. (Updated on September 17 at 11:18 AM PT to clarify how private accounts are applied)\n\nMessaging restrictions: Teens will be placed in the strictest messaging settings, so they can only be messaged by people they follow or are already connected to.\n\nSensitive content restrictions: Teens will automatically be placed into the most restrictive setting of our sensitive content control, which limits the type of sensitive content (such as content that shows people fighting or promotes cosmetic procedures) teens see in places like Explore and Reels.\n\nLimited interactions: Teens can only be tagged or mentioned by people they follow. We’ll also automatically turn on the most restrictive version of our anti-bullying feature, Hidden Words, so that offensive words and phrases will be filtered out of teens’ comments and DM requests.\n\nTime limit reminders: Teens will get notifications telling them to leave the app after 60 minutes each day.\n\nSleep mode enabled: Sleep mode will be turned on between 10 PM and 7 AM, which will mute notifications overnight and send auto-replies to DMs.\n\n“Given that parents today are grappling with the benefits and challenges of the internet and digital media for their teens, our association applauds Meta for launching Instagram Teen Accounts. With teens automatically placed in Teen Accounts and certain privacy settings turned on by default, this update demonstrates that Meta is taking steps to empower parents and deliver safer, more age-appropriate experiences on the platform.”\n\n– Yvonne Johnson, President, National PTA\n\nHow To Approve Changes To a Teen’s Settings\n\nTeens under 16 will need their parent’s permission to use less protective settings. To get permission, teens will need to set up parental supervision on Instagram. If parents want more oversight over their older teen’s (16+) experiences, they simply have to turn on parental supervision. Then, they can approve any changes to these settings, irrespective of their teen’s age.\n\nOnce supervision is established, parents can approve and deny their teens’ requests to change settings or allow teens to manage their settings themselves. Soon, parents will also be able to change these settings directly to be more protective. Learn more about how to manage Teen Accounts.\n\n“Instagram Teen Accounts reflect the importance of tailoring teens’ online experiences to their developmental stages, and implementing appropriate protections. Younger adolescents are more vulnerable as their skills are still emerging and require additional safeguards and protection. Overall, the settings are age-specific, with younger and older teens being offered different protections.”\n\n– Rachel Rodgers, PhD Associate Professor of Applied Psychology, Northeastern University\n\nMore Ways for Parents To Get Involved, If They Want\n\nWhile Teen Accounts put new protections in place automatically, many parents want to be even more involved in their teen’s experiences, so we’re also adding to our supervision feature. Updates include ways to:\n\nGet insights into who their teens are chatting with: While parents can’t read their teen’s messages, now they will be able to see who their teen has messaged in the past seven days.\n\nSet total daily time limits for teens’ Instagram usage: Parents can decide how much time their teen can spend on Instagram each day. Once a teen hits that limit, they’ll no longer be able to access the app.\n\nBlock teens from using Instagram for specific time periods: Parents can choose to block their teens from using Instagram at night, or specific time periods, with one easy button.\n\nSee topics your teen is looking at: Parents can view the age-appropriate topics their teen has chosen to see content from, based on their interests.\n\nHow We’re Enforcing Teen Accounts\n\nTeens may lie about their age and that’s why we’re requiring them to verify their age in more places, like if they attempt to use a new account with an adult birthday. We’re also building technology to proactively find accounts belonging to teens, even if the account lists an adult birthday. This technology will allow us to proactively find these teens and place them in the same protections offered by Teen Account settings. We’ll start testing this change in the US early next year. You can read more about those details here.\n\nHelping Ensure Teens See Age-Appropriate Content\n\nWe recognize parents are concerned that their teens might see mature or inappropriate content online, which is why we have stricter rules around the kinds of content teens see on our apps. We remove content that breaks our rules and avoid recommending potentially sensitive content – such as sexually suggestive content or content discussing suicide or self-harm. With Instagram Teen Accounts, teens will be placed into the strictest setting of our sensitive content control, so they’re even less likely to be recommended sensitive content, and in many cases we hide this content altogether from teens, even if it’s shared by someone they follow.\n\n“It’s important that safety and privacy protections are the default settings, both to improve teens’ online experience and to reduce some of the burden that has fallen to parents. We look forward to hearing from teens about their experience of these new Teen Accounts and associated features and settings.”\n\n– Dr. Megan Moreno, Co-Medical Director of the SAMHSA-Funded AAP Center of Excellence on Social Media and Youth Mental Health\n\nWhen To Expect These Changes\n\nToday, we’ll start placing teens who sign up for Instagram into Teen Accounts, and we’ll notify teens already using Instagram about these changes so we can begin moving them into Teen Accounts next week.\n\nWe plan to place teens into Teen Accounts within 60 days in the US, UK, Canada and Australia, and to start placing them in Teen Accounts in the European Union later this year. Teens around the world will start to get Teen Accounts in January. We’ll also bring Teen Accounts to other Meta platforms next year. These are big updates that will change the Instagram experience for millions of teens, and we need to make sure they work correctly.\n\n“These updates to Instagram’s Teen Accounts offer a balanced approach, empowering parents with essential oversight while respecting teens’ right to participate and explore. In an ever-evolving online world, this update ensures that young people can engage meaningfully and safely, fostering positive connections while still providing the protection they need.”\n\n– Lucy Thomas OAM, CEO & Co-Founder, Project Rockit",

      "# [Font with Built-In Syntax Highlighting](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41245159)\nWhat a fun hack!\n\nOne small note: the post seems slightly confused about the use of OpenType features, as it calls for:\n\nfont-feature-settings: \"colr\", \"calt\";\n\nbut there's no 'colr' feature tag in the font's OpenType layout tables, so that's meaningless here.\n\nI suppose this was intended to \"activate\" the color glyph table (COLR) in the font; but that isn't an OpenType layout feature that would be controlled by font-feature-settings, and doesn't need to be \"turned on\" like this.\n\n(In addition, the 'calt' feature is (according to the spec[1]) supposed to be active by default, so it shouldn't be necessary to explicitly set it either. And indeed, the font works for me in both Firefox and Chrome without this rule; sadly Safari doesn't seem to handle it.)\n\n[1] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/typography/opentype/spec/f...\n\nKudos * 1000 ! ! !\n\nImpossible before. It can't be less invasive: _original text stays intact_ - no wrapping tags.. no JS.. just works with userContent.css.. - simply another dimension.\n\n> I'm also not an OpenType expert, so I'm sure the substitution logics could be improved upon. I'm open to sharing the modified source file to anyone interested. If you have any ideas, suggestions or feedback, let me know. You can reach me at hlotvonen@gmail.com.\n\n- so, how far can it be improved then ?!\n\n- what other font editors moreover to Glyph (mac only) have good support for advanced contextual alternates ?\n\nThank you! (I'm the author) I'm also very curious to know if there's some nifty way of improving the lookup logic. What I did was kind of a brute force method, but on the other hand, the CALT \"language\" is very limited.\n\nFor font editors, Glyphs is the industry standard, and, as far as I know, there are not many good alternatives. There's FontForge, but its contextual alternate editing seems even more confusing: https://fontforge.org/docs/ui/dialogs/contextchain.html\n\nJust today I found out about a new browser based font editor, fontra, but it looks like editing OpenType features is still on its roadmap. Maybe something to keep an eye on though. https://fontra.xyz/\n\nYou should invent a new font type.\n\nYou asked what it takes to make a blog.\n\nI have a html front page, tag pages and posts. All static.\n\nThere is a pretty short php page that takes an existing post or the dummy, chops off everything in front and behind the text.\n\nThe tag cloud sits under it. Clicking a tag injects it under the text.\n\nWhen saved the top and bottom html are reatached and the title <h2> is copied into the <title> tag.\n\nIt then creates or overwrites the static html document.\n\nIt finds tags in the html and inserts a link to the new article into the tag and index pages.\n\nLoad, split, join and save is actually less complicated than sql and faster:)\n\nDeleting tags and blogpostings is done manually.\n\nBesides editpost.php there is a bookmarklet to inject quotes with links and youtube embeds.\n\nI am using 11ty for the blog, and it works great, for now. But there's two reasons I don't like it:\n\n1. I need to have two different versions of my site, dev and prod, which I find very restricting and fragile.\n\n2. I don't like to rely on other people updating their npm packages just so I could publish static content. I've been burned too many times by abandoned npm packages or breaking changes.\n\nIt's definitely going to be significantly slower as a result of all the contextual lookups.\n\nTo get an idea, I repeatedly duplicated the CSS in the \"tiny sandbox\" until there were nearly 20,000 lines there, and then profiled the operation of changing the font-size by 1px in Firefox. Reflowing the textbox took about 1.6 seconds.\n\nWith `font-feature-settings: \"calt\" off` applied, so that the contextual lookups aren't being run, a font-size change for that same textbox content reflows in about 100 milliseconds.\n\n(I don't have actual timings for the same example in Chrome, but subjectively, with \"calt\" disabled, the resize is near-instant, whereas with it enabled, it's quite laggy, similar to Firefox.)\n\nIn Firefox, 4000 lines of CSS: editing last lines is fast and instant, editing first lines is a bit jumpy refreshing every few edits in 0.2s-1.2s - however undo/redo is quite fast - but not so fast as with last lines, and.. from the first impression, guesses:\n\n-= the highlight is always there, instantly =- (or.. it doesn't a look like a reason for jumpy lines because of redo) - definintly less cycles and memory overhead and I don't see that possible with DOM and JS - the delays could be there only because of inefficient editing operations with no impact of coloring.. and maybe with.. smaller textfragments (or ?) there could be no such delays at all - but simple* coloring coud be always so instant (and easy) ? (yes, I know, so far it may be also limiting and exclusive)\n\nAnother issue you'd run into, I suspect, is that in practice text engines/editors/etc will often repaint only fragments of the content, and so the syntax highlighter would not necessarily see all the context it needs.\n\nE.g. if you have a comment that starts with \"/*\" and ends several lines later with \"*/\", but the editor decides to just redraw a line in the middle, the highlighter won't \"know\" to use the comment color as the text-drawing operation won't include the delimiters.\n\n(This issue already exists in a small way, as mentioned in https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41251114, but it'd only get worse as the syntax highlighter becomes more sophisticated.)\n\nAs an experiment, it is awesome. We should strive to push the limits of technology and try new things. Kudos. I tip my hat to the creativity.\n\nAs something practical, the author started with the wrong tool for the job (JavaScript), and then used an even more wrong tool for the same job (The font itself!)\n\nJust use a code editor with Syntax Highlighting! Vim solved this decades ago!\n\nVery interesting read, but don't try this at home.\n\nEdit: Pandora's box is opened, I can see Jira and GitHub rushing to add support for this on their websites starting tomorrow =)\n\n> Just use a code editor with Syntax Highlighting! Vim solved this decades ago!\n\nYou are aware that this blog post is about displaying syntax highlighted code on the web? This is literally explained in the first paragraphs of the blog post..\n\nAs of now there were four ways of doing that:\n\n1. using an image (which sucks)\n\n2. manually setting the colors (good luck)\n\n3. Generating the syntax highlighting server-side (preferred, but you need a backend that can do it)\n\n4. Generating it client side using JS (waste of energy, takes a time to finish)\n\nAnd now a font. Depending on the use case this could be a feasible option, although I am just waiting for this to be exploited in some fashion.\n\nI still think computing once styling later is preferable.",

      "# [Apple will start selling AirPods with built-in hearing aids by Rob Wile, Angela Yang on 2024-09-09](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/apple-will-start-selling-airpods-built-hearing-aids-rcna170293)\nApple said Monday that a version of its latest AirPods earbuds will come with built-in hearing aids, which it says would help more than 1 billion people globally.\n\nThe feature on the AirPods Pro, which Apple describes as equivalent to an over-the-counter hearing aid, is designed for users with mild to moderate hearing loss. After users take hearing tests on iPhones or iPads running iOS 18, their AirPods will make \"personalized dynamic adjustments\" to allow them to properly hear their immediate listening environments, with sounds boosted to prescribed levels in real time.\n\n\"This helps them better engage in conversation, and keeps them connected to the people and environment around them,\" Apple said.\n\nThe settings are also automatically applied to any media a user is listening to.\n\nThe hearing test takes about five minutes. Results, including audiograms, will be stored privately within the Health app.\n\nThe AirPods Pro will use the personalized hearing profile to inform how its hearing aid feature adjusts sounds in real time, including phone calls, music and other types of media.\n\nThe AirPods upgrade also includes a passive noise-reduction hearing loss \"prevention\" feature that automatically dampens ambient loud noises — while retaining audio integrity — which Apple says would come in handy at live concerts.\n\nApple noted that according to the World Health Organization, about 1.5 billion people around the world live with hearing loss.\n\n“For decades, Apple has led the way in designing products for everyone and supporting users with a broad spectrum of hearing abilities,” Sarah Herrlinger, Apple’s senior director of global accessibility policy and initiatives, said in a statement. “These features on AirPods Pro will make an impact on so many people by driving more awareness around hearing health and empowering individuals with new customizable tools to help them stay connected.”\n\nThe company also announced new Apple Watch features to detect sleep apnea. The device will use a “Breathing Disturbances” metric to trigger sleep apnea notifications, a feature that is expected to roll out this month after it is approved by global health authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
      "# [Dell's New XPS Lineup: Futuristic Design, with Built-in AI by Dell Technologies on 2024-01-04](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dells-new-xps-lineup-futuristic-design-with-built-in-ai-302025638.html)\nThis bold design has forever changed the ID of the XPS brand. Now, we are unifying the design across our XPS portfolio, introducing new screen sizes with the XPS 16 and XPS 14 and revamping the XPS 13 Plus to XPS 13. This trio of laptops share elements that eliminate distractions and place the focus on productivity.\n\nThe new XPS designs take a minimalistic approach that elevates the brand. The portfolio is made of CNC machined aluminum and Gorilla Glass 3, and tone-on-tone colors (available in Graphite and Platinum). The striking, unconventional look has key components that amplify the laptop experience. They feature a touch function row to switch between media and function keys easily, a seamless glass touchpad with haptic feedback and larger keycaps that provide a comfortable and smooth typing experience with every keystroke.\n\nStyle Meets Performance\n\nEach new XPS laptop features InfinityEdge panels with OLED touch options, variable refresh rates, high-resolution options, stunning color and Dolby Vision® for rich detail. The new portfolio boasts an exceptional audio experience starting with a quad speaker design, support for Dolby Atmos® immersive audio and 3D stereo surround from MaxxAudio® Pro by Waves. Plus, the new intelligent FHD 1080p webcam provides crystal clear video calls.\n\nThe lineup also brings new AI-enabled features, with AI acceleration built into the device thanks to Intel Core Ultra processors and experiences brought to life by Windows 11. These experiences enhance creativity and productivity while also providing better performance and longer battery life.1 (If this sounds too good to be true, read more about the efficiencies created from on-device AI here.) And speaking of battery life, all XPS laptops feature ExpressCharge to recharge 80% of battery life in just 60 minutes, so you can keep your creative flow going.\n\nIntroducing the New XPS Portfolio\n\nDell pioneered the art of engineering narrow bezels to minimize the device's footprint and maximize screen size. Now you can say hello to our new immersive 16- and 14-inch screens. The new XPS 16 and XPS 14 bring more portability to our XPS laptops and place the focus on performance and design.\n\nThe XPS 16 is the frontrunner of the portfolio, with supercharged performance for complex workloads. Featuring the latest Intel Core Ultra processors and NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs (up to the GeForce RTX 4070 GPU), the XPS 16 is our most powerful XPS laptop with up to 80W of sustained performance. Whether editing videos or testing the latest AI software, it's ideal for those running demanding apps, providing a smooth and fast experience.\n\nCombining performance, design and portability, the XPS 14 is a great option for those who need the freedom of working from anywhere. The XPS 14 is 21% lighter than the XPS 162 but still delivers powerful performance to complete challenging tasks with ease. With optional NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs (up to the GeForce RTX 4050 GPU), you can edit and play high-resolution videos effortlessly. And with long battery life, it's a refined laptop made to move with you.\n\nBoth XPS 16 and XPS 14 are NVIDIA Studio-validated systems, 3 meaning they deliver industry-leading performance for demanding creative tasks such as 3D rendering, video editing and live streaming, while offering exclusive access to the Studio AI-powered suite of tools and enhanced stability with NVIDIA Studio Drivers.\n\nXPS 13 started our design revolution and set our vision of the future with its iconic design. Starting at just 2.6 pounds, it's our thinnest and lightest XPS, so you can carry the device wherever you're headed. The renewed laptop has three new display options to choose from (including FHD+, QHD+ touch and 3K+ OLED touch) to provide you with a versatile visual experience, suitable for everyday productivity to high-resolution content creation. The XPS 13 is the ideal multitasking machine to balance school, work, personal projects or entertainment.\n\nXPS 16, XPS 14, XPS 13 Fact Sheet and Spec Sheet\n\nAI, Your New Best Friend\n\nAI and generative AI (GenAI) are driving the latest wave of innovation and unlocking new possibilities on the PC. It's exciting to see PCs built with AI acceleration into the device—something we touched on earlier, but let's take this a step further.\n\nThe new XPS portfolio, powered by Intel Core Ultra processors, features a built-in AI acceleration engine with the addition of a neural processing unit (NPU). This means the PC no longer needs to rely solely on the CPU or GPU for processing and performance. Imagine you are a creator who is always on the go and editing photos in Adobe Lightroom. The addition of the NPU automatically leverages the right compute engine for your workload—in this case letting you edit images faster than before while preserving battery life.\n\nThe laptops all come with Copilot in Windows 11, harnessing the capabilities of AI to make the things you do every day easier, faster and effortless. The portfolio also features a Copilot key designed to make it even easier to get things done and stay in the flow of work. Now, with the press of a key, you can have quick access to your everyday AI companion.\n\nSustainable From Top to Bottom\n\nWe continue our commitment to incorporate more sustainable materials in both our products and packaging. The new XPS family has the highest level of sustainable materials yet, 5 and for the first time, the new XPS family is designed with recycled aluminum and low emissions aluminum4 made from a renewable energy source. This reduces the carbon footprint of this material by up to 89%. 4 Made from 100% recycled or renewable content, 5 the packaging used to protect XPS laptops brings us one step closer to meeting our ambitious 2030 Advancing Sustainability Goals.\n\nThe new XPS family is registered EPEAT Gold and complies with EPEAT's new and stringent climate criteria to achieve the EPEAT Climate+ Designation. With the Climate+ designation, these laptops have met industry's best practices for decarbonization. 6\n\nFinal Words\n\nCheck out our official CES 2024 press kit and the official XPS page for more information on each of the announcements.

      "# [Samsung debuts Galaxy S24 smartphones with built-in AI tools by Elizabeth Napolitano on 2024-01-17](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s24-smartphone-ai-tools/)\nSamsung on Wednesday unveiled its latest lineup of Galaxy smartphones featuring a suite of baked-in AI tools, as it aims to widen the appeal of its Android devices and win back its spot as the world's biggest phone seller from Apple.\n\nThe company debuted the devices during its annual product launch in San Jose, California, emphasizing the new AI integrations, including smart translation and interpretation services and in-app image searches. The focus on AI marks a shift in the tech giant's previous hardware-heavy approach to developing and marketing its smartphones.\n\nThe next-generation lineup includes three phones:\n\nThe Galaxy S24, which retails for $799.99\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Plus, which costs $999.99\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is priced at $1,299.99\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra's price represents a price hike of $100, or an 8% increase, from last year's comparable model. The increase mirrors what Apple did with its fanciest model, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, released in September.\n\nCustomers can preorder the devices starting Wednesday. The new phones will begin shipping on January 31.\n\nHere's what to expect from Samsung's next-generation Galaxy smartphones.\n\nLive foreign language interpretations\n\nThe new phone will allow users to access a function that enables foreign language interpretation during calls. The feature will support 13 languages and 17 dialects, and it will be accessible for calls to and from any type of smartphones as well as landlines.\n\nThe feature saves users' preferred language settings, in addition to collecting data on which languages are used on each of the users' phone calls.\n\nIn-app image searches\n\nGoogle will offer \"Circle To Search\" on the newest Galaxy smartphones, allowing users to circle snippets of text, parts of photos or videos to get instant search results about whatever has been highlighted.\n\nThe new Galaxy phones will also enable quick and easy ways to manipulate the appearance and placement of specific parts of pictures taken on the devices' camera. It's a feature that could help people refine their photos, but could also make it easier to create misleading images.\n\nAI-powered photo editing tools\n\nThe new smartphones will come with a range of AI-powered photo editing tools. With the generative edit tool, users can erase or modify the position of objects in their images, in addition to filling in images' borders to correct a crooked photo frame.\n\nGalaxy's AI will also offer an edit suggestion option, allowing users to receive automated feedback on how to optimize and tweak their photos.\n\nHow does this compare with Apple's iPhones?\n\nApple is expected to put more AI into its next generation of iPhones in September, but now Samsung has a head start toward gaining the upper hand in making the technology more ubiquitous, Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson said.\n\nIt's a competitive edge that Samsung could use, having ceded its longstanding mantle as the world's largest seller of smartphones to Apple last year, according to the market research firm International Data Corp.\n\n\"Samsung's marketing challenge is precisely to make the technology transparent to impress consumers with magic and invisible experiences,\" Husson said.\n\n—With reporting by the Associated Press.",

      "# [Panasonic Announces Return to the US with New Line-Up of OLED and Mini-LED TVs with Fire TV Built In](https://na.panasonic.com/news/panasonic-announces-return-to-the-us-with-new-line-up-of-oled-and-mini-led-tvs-with-fire-tv-built-in)\nNewark, N.J. (September 4, 2024) – Today, Panasonic announced its return to the US with its industry-leading TVs after a decade-long absence. The new line-up includes OLED (Z95A and Z85A) and Mini-LED (W95A) TVs ranging from 55 to 85 inches, all designed and developed in Japan, showcasing Panasonic's outstanding picture quality.\n\nThrough a global collaboration with Amazon, these models come with Fire TV built in, offering a seamless, content-forward smart TV experience. Starting today, US consumers can pre-order these TVs from retailers such as Amazon and Costco.com.\n\nYasunari Anan, Executive Vice President of Panasonic Entertainment & Communication Co., Ltd., said: “The United States is crucially important to us, and ever since we left ten years ago, it has been my mission to find a way to return. Today is the end of that long journey and the beginning of a new one to bring new choice to US consumers. From this year, we have started a global collaboration with Amazon so that new Panasonic smart TVs will have Fire TV built in. These TVs have already been launched in Japan, Asia, Oceania, and Europe and the response from consumers has absolutely exceeded our expectations. We are confident US consumers are also going to be thrilled with them.”\n\n\"We're excited to expand our collaboration with Panasonic—combining their outstanding picture quality together with Fire TV's content-forward streaming experience—to U.S. customers,\" said Daniel Rausch, VP of Alexa and Fire TV at Amazon. \"This new lineup offers OLED and Mini LED displays—firsts for Fire TV built in—as well as the immersive Fire TV Ambient Experience. Customers in other countries have been loving the brilliant display, seamless Alexa integration, and impressive audio these smart TVs offer. We look forward to bringing this premium viewing experience to even more customers.\"\n\nReasons for US Return\n\nPanasonic, one of Japan’s most popular consumer electronics brands, was driven to re-enter the US by a strong belief in the unmet demand for their televisions, particularly among consumers seeking the highest possible picture quality. As consumers live through what many call the Golden Age of Television, the number of discerning viewers has increased, with more people wanting to experience their favorite content exactly as it was intended. Panasonic's collaboration with Hollywood professionals has resulted in TVs that deliver an exceptional viewing experience right out of the box, reflecting their renowned Japanese precision and expertise.\n\nIn addition to the demand for high-quality picture performance, the rise of smart homes has transformed consumer expectations. Panasonic recognized that today's viewers desire more than just great picture quality; they seek smart experiences that seamlessly integrate with their evolving smart home environments. By partnering with Amazon, Panasonic has ensured that their TVs provide outstanding smart capabilities, allowing users to connect effortlessly with other devices and platforms.\n\nPanasonic’s flexible business structure and global manufacturing platform have enabled them to expand efficiently, making it possible to meet the diverse needs of the US consumers. With their unique combination of cutting-edge Japanese technology, accurate picture and sound quality, innovative design, advanced integration of Fire TV, and competitive pricing, Panasonic is confident in its ability to offer something truly valuable to US consumers.\n\nUnique Panasonic Offering\n\nPanasonic TVs have long been known for the accuracy of their picture quality out of the box. Panasonic achieved this through combining proprietary Japanese technology and knowhow with years of collaboration with Hollywood's leading creators, who have helped Panasonic continuously fine-tune their hallmark picture accuracy. For professionals and enthusiasts, Panasonic offers a wide range of picture settings, enabling them to achieve the precise visual experience they desire.\n\nHowever, Panasonic's mission extends beyond catering solely to experts. The brand is driven by the belief that everyone should have access to the best possible picture quality. To this end, Panasonic employs optional Auto AI features that automatically adjust picture settings based on the type of content being viewed and the ambient light in a room. This ensures that casual viewers, who may prefer not to tweak settings manually, can still enjoy an optimal viewing experience. By catering to both kinds of users—those who appreciate detailed customization and those who prefer effortless adjustments—Panasonic delivers access to accurate picture quality for everyone.\n\nSee It All. Feel It All.\n\nWith over 70 years of experience in television development, Panasonic remains at the forefront of delivering outstandingly accurate picture quality for its customers. This achievement is a result of a unique combination of cutting-edge Japanese engineering, advanced technology, and close collaboration with Hollywood’s leading experts, known for their \"golden eyes.\"\n\nThe central challenge in Panasonic’s TV development lies in ensuring that three critical components—the cell, the module, and the processor—work together in perfect harmony. This synergy is essential to unlocking the maximum performance potential of each panel. By meticulously tuning these elements with input from Hollywood’s finest visual experts, Panasonic strives to achieve uncompromised picture accuracy. Any misalignment among these components would undermine the precise picture quality that Panasonic aims to deliver.\n\nAt the heart of Panasonic’s picture quality is the HCX Pro AI Processor MK II processor, which serves as the brain of the operation. The processor is crucial in delivering accuracy in color, contrast, and clarity, ensuring that Panasonic TVs provide optimal picture quality right out of the box.\n\nColor: Panasonic’s dynamic 3D LUTs (Look-Up Tables) enable precisely detailed color reproduction, with thousands of registry points ensuring true-to-life colors.\n\nContrast: Supporting major HDR formats, Panasonic’s unique tone-mapping technology optimizes for natural contrast reproduction, delivering stunning images regardless of brightness levels.\n\nClarity: The processor enhances gradation, motion images, and detail through advanced analysis functions, including 4K Fine Remaster and Smooth Motion Drive Pro, ensuring a sharp and clear viewing experience.\n\nPanasonic’s dedication to integrating these elements into a cohesive whole underscores its commitment to providing the most accurate picture quality, bringing customers closer to the filmmaker’s original vision.\n\nLine Up for the United States\n\nPanasonic announced that it will initially sell three series of TVs in the United States. The flagship Z95A OLED TV, available in 65”; the Z85A OLED TV, available in 65” and 55” sizes. In addition, Panasonic will also sell the W95 mini-LED series, available in 55”, 65”, 75”, and a whopping 85” sizes. All of these TVs are substantially the same as those sold by the brand in other regions, with some minor regional differences.\n\nThe new Z95A OLED TV represents the combination of a brand-new chipset and bright panel, the HCX Pro AI Processor MK II, with the Master OLED Ultimate panel, with Panasonic’s technical accuracy made possible by Japanese knowhow and engineering, merged with the color-tuning skills of Stefan Sonnenfeld. Sonnenfeld, Founder and CEO of Company 3 is a trusted collaborator of some of the world’s best filmmakers. He is among a handful of leading artists who have championed the power of color grading to tell stories and communicate emotion.\n\nDescribed by NPR as the “da Vinci of the movies,” Sonnenfeld has applied his skills as a colorist to many of the most acclaimed and popular features of the past decade: Top Gun: Maverick, A Star is Born, Wonder Woman, HBO’s White Lotus, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Jurassic World, 300 and many more. Like many other leading colorists, studios, and postproduction houses, he uses Panasonic OLED screens as large-format client reference monitors in his daily workflow.\n\nPanasonic’s Z95A utilizes a Master OLED Ultimate panel module which is equipped with state-of-the-art Micro Lens Array and a multi-layer heat management configuration developed by Panasonic engineers. The panel delivers unprecedented brightness thanks to improvements in the driving technology and this heat management.\n\nThe 2024 global brand new HCX Pro AI Processor MK II in all models powers the new 4K Remaster Engine which elevates streaming picture clarity, by combining AI and mathematical models for crisp, natural images, and superior streaming noise reduction. Gradation has also been improved to reduce banding.\n\nBoth sets also support Dolby Vision IQTM Precision detail, a picture enhancement system that aims to reveal extra details. It is an advancement on Dolby Vision IQTM and operates by adjusting the light levels in each area of the screen to draw out more detail, without boosting the brightness to a point where the image looks washed out.\n\nThis technology works in tandem with a TV's embedded ambient light sensors to perceive how bright it is in the living room and then adjust the on-screen picture to ensure that every detail can be seen, even the darkest of scenes. The new HCX Pro AI Processor MK II also enables Dolby Vision® support up to 144Hz.\n\nTechnics engineers have also meticulously tuned the Z95A displays to ensure content is viewed and heard as intended by its creators. With 360 Soundscape Pro tuned by Technics, featuring multidirectional speakers and Dolby Atmos® support, delivering immersive 3D surround sound.\n\nThe latest Mini LED panel technology featured in the W95A brings enhanced backlight control with Local Dimming Ultra for the tightest reproduction of image brightness and darkness. This Panasonic engineering minimises the “halo effect” found on many LCD TVs, and a Quantum Dot Sheet brings further superior color reproduction and contrast enhancements.\n\nPanasonic with Fire TV built in: Explore more. Feel more.\n\nThanks to a global collaboration with Amazon, Panasonic’s newly launched TVs seamlessly integrate your favorite streaming and live TV channels, apps, and tailored recommendations on one main home screen so you can quickly find what you love without the endless scrolling. Users can create up to six user profiles and have access to unique watchlists, personalized recommendations, and settings. They include the Voice Remote with Alexa to easily launch apps, play music, search for titles, and more, using your voice. The Z95A also has far-field voice control with Alexa, so you can easily control your entertainment experience with your voice from across the living room without reaching for the remote.\n\nThese TVs are also not just entertainment devices, but also hubs for smart home management. Fully compatible with Alexa-enabled devices such as Ring Doorbells, they feature a smart home dashboard, enabling users to monitor and control their connected home ecosystem seamlessly. They all also transform into dynamic displays when content is not streaming with the Fire TV Ambient Experience. The Ambient Experience turns the biggest screen in your home into a beautiful, always-on smart display rotating through beautiful art, personal photos, and glanceable information like calendars and reminders that keep you updated throughout the day through customizable Alexa widgets.\n\nFinally, when not in use for viewing content, those TVs transform into dynamic displays. The Fire TV Ambient Experience turns the biggest screen in your home into a beautiful, always-smart display. This can turn the TV into an in-home gallery, display personal photos, and show glanceable information like calendars and reminders through customizable Alexa widgets.\n\nIn addition, Panasonic TV remotes have the unique “MyApp” button, which can be programmed to directly open a favorite app, channel, or even a favorite voice control command.\n\nLevel Up Your Game\n\nIn recent years, gaming has undergone a rapid transformation. Storylines are crafted with the depth and excitement of Hollywood blockbusters, 3D worlds have expanded in size and realism, and countless gaming universes await exploration. To fully immerse themselves in this evolving entertainment landscape, gamers have traditionally relied on monitors designed to maximize the performance of the latest consoles and PCs, which boast advanced rendering technologies and lightning-fast load times.\n\nHowever, Panasonic TVs now offer a compelling alternative, providing the same high-quality experience that gamers have come to expect from specialized monitors. With Panasonic, gamers can enjoy all the benefits of advanced gaming technology on a larger screen, enhancing their immersion in the gaming worlds they love.\n\nIn a ground-breaking development for gaming enthusiasts, the Z95A are some of the world's first OLED TVs to deliver a 144Hz refresh rate. This feature ensures unparalleled responsiveness, a boon for gamers seeking a competitive edge. The heart of this innovation is the New HCX Pro AI Processor MK II, acclaimed for rendering vivid, seamless, and crystal-clear imagery.\n\nThanks to this new processor, Panasonic is unveiling improved \"Game Mode Extreme,\" which equips the TVs with cutting-edge gaming functionalities, making them ready for the latest consoles and PCs. Notably, the inclusion of HDMI 2.1 High Frame Rate and VRR up to 144Hz means more frames per second, resulting in faster, smoother gameplay. Another significant enhancement is the improved Dolby Vision Gaming, now also compatible with frame rates up to 144Hz. This upgrade ensures the ultimate contrast and superior picture quality in High Dynamic Range, elevating the gaming experience. 1\n\nFurthermore, these TVs boast an ultra-low input lag, a feature crucial for fast-paced games, as it ensures that every controller action is instantly reflected on the screen, giving players a competitive edge against their opponents.\n\nPanasonic TVs also support True Game Mode, a picture pre-set specifically tailored to enhance color accuracy, including optimal white balance and grayscale settings. The result is a gaming experience that closely aligns with the vision of game developers, offering players a cinematic and authentic visual journey.\n\nIn addition to visual enhancements, these TVs also feature specialized Game Sound Modes for RPG (Role-Playing Games) and FPS (First-Person Shooter) genres. The RPG mode creates a 3D soundscape with clear dialogues, essential for immersive storytelling and strategic gameplay. Conversely, the FPS mode is finely tuned to accentuate crucial sound cues, like footsteps, providing a tactical advantage in shooter games.\n\nFurthermore, HDR Picture Adjustment with Tone Mapping OFF is another notable feature. It allows for perfect adjustment of HDR games right at the source, rather than the TV. This ensures high brightness levels and detailed visibility, without overblowing the highlights.\n\nAll game settings are easily accessible from an updated ‘Game Control Board’ onscreen overlay, which provides a game settings dashboard allowing fast access to all settings. You can also place it on the customisable My App button on the remote control for quick access.\n\nThese TVs are also NVIDIA® G-SYNC® Compatible2 and AMD FreeSync™ Premium certified televisions. Owners of the latest consoles and AMD Radeon™ graphics cards can plug in and play without a care in the world thanks to AMD FreeSync™ technology, which puts an end to choppy gameplay and broken frames for a smooth gaming experience. G-SYNC also means that when a TV is connected to a PC using a NVIDIA GeForce RTX graphics card, it automatically optimizes input lag and VRR settings, ensuring fluid, tear-free gaming experience that is validated by NVIDIA.\n\n1Z85A: Up to 120Hz\n\n2Only OLED series.\n\nFeatures and specifications may differ by region.\n\nDolby, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos and the double-D symbol are registered trademarks of Dolby Laboratories Licensing Corporation.

That would be for ground work, building construction, electrical work and more.\n\nHe says his company chose to locate in Blue Earth because electricity is less expensive here, and because of the availability of space. He also mentioned the fact that Bevcomm has fiber optic high speed internet service here.\n\n“We also talked to Blue Earth officials at the city and at Blue Earth Light and Water and they were very receptive,” Levesque says. “It was incredible to see they were willing to work with us and fast track this project.”\n\nHe also calls it a win-win situation, for both his business and the local governments who will get taxes and for BELW who will furnish the electricity.\n\nThe CEO also says they will have some employees at the facility.\n\n“We have one open position to start,” Levesque explains. “In fact, we have that position posted online and I believe we are already conducting some interviews.”\n\nHe explained that the people they hire to be technicians do not need a lot of previous knowledge and do not necessarily need a degree from a university. They will be trained by the company for the work they need to do.\n\nLevesque says he and the company both want to have an open door policy when it comes to questions.\n\n“We want to be open about what we are doing,” he says. “People can send questions to us, or they can also contact Tim Stoner at Blue Earth Light and Water.”\n\nAAIM can be contacted by email at info@aaimdc.com or by phone at 573-935-7831.\n\nLevesque, who is from Montreal, Canada, says he is planning to be in Blue Earth around the end of July to check things out.\n\n“From Blue Earth Light and Water’s standpoint we are very excited about working together with AAIM on this project,” says Tim Stoner of BELW. “And the potential of additional business in the near future.”\n\n“I am excited that Blue Earth can welcome another business,” Blue Earth mayor Rick Scholtes says. “Because of the investments in infrastructure that our community has made we are able to accommodate economic growth and development.”",
      "# [A built-in pocket protector keeps sawfish from ‘sword fighting’ in the womb by ccrockett, Natalie van Hoose on 2024-05-30](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stops-sawfish-from-sword-fighting-womb)\nSmalltooth sawfish develop their signature, long, tooth-lined snout while still in the womb. The needle-sharp teeth are encased in a specialized sheath that prevents the rays from cutting up their mother and siblings during gestation and birth. Now, scientists have gotten their first close-up look at this built-in pocket protector.\n\n“It’s a cool thing Mother Nature figured out to protect mom from those calcified teeth and protect siblings from sword fighting in the uterus,” says fish biologist Gregg Poulakis of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission in Charlotte Harbor.\n\nObservations of baby sawfish and laboratory analysis of tissue samples have revealed that the sheath is a tough, multilayered “second skin” that sheds within about four days after birth, Poulakis and colleagues report May 28 in Fishery Bulletin. The finding overturns a long-held assumption that the sheath was a fragile, gelatinous membrane.\n\n“I think a lot of the descriptions historically are based on the fact that people have just seen them in pictures,” says Dean Grubbs, a fish ecologist at Florida State University’s Coastal and Marine Laboratory in St. Teresa who was not involved in the work. “It’s a significant structure … as you would expect it to be if it is going to essentially shield those really sharp points.”\n\nThe species, Pristis pectinata, is found primarily in waters off South Florida and the western Bahamas. The ray is so rare that it took Poulakis and colleagues 18 years of near-monthly research trips to collect a handful of sheath tissue samples.\n\nThe sheath feels like paraffin wax, Poulakis says: firm, but with a slight give. “You can’t peel it off.”\n\nA combination of histology, scanning electron microscopy, micro-CT and elemental analysis of the samples show the sheath has two tissue layers that resemble an epidermis and a dermis, as well as proteins that look like keratin, reticulin and collagen. This suggests the sheath is a second skin, but the researchers emphasize more work is needed to confirm that’s what they’re seeing.\n\nThe research provides more insight into the life history of the smalltooth sawfish, which is critically endangered due to habitat loss and accidental entanglement in fishing nets (SN: 6/5/15). Scientists had begun to be cautiously optimistic that smalltooth sawfish were on the brink of a comeback, Poulakis says. But that burgeoning recovery is now threatened by an ongoing, mysterious die-off in Florida’s Lower Keys. Dozens of sawfish have died, and Poulakis and others are racing to determine why.\n\n“It’s discouraging when something like this happens and makes us take a step or two back,” Poulakis says. “We’re taking a lot of samples that will help us learn about the species beyond this mortality event.”",
      "# [How a tool built in Washington is helping schools fight absenteeism by NIck Ng on 2024-09-23](https://myedmondsnews.com/2024/09/how-a-tool-built-in-washington-is-helping-schools-fight-absenteeism/)\nWith student absenteeism at record highs, more Washington districts are using a tool developed by researchers at Washington State University to help get kids back on track.\n\nIt’s called “WARNS” — or the Washington Assessment of the Risks and Needs of Students. About half of Washington’s districts will use the tool this school year: a projected 146 of the state’s 295 districts, up from 90 in 2019.\n\nThe 40-question, web-based assessment for middle and high school students is meant to help figure out why individual students are missing classes and what they need to stay in school.\n\n“The idea is to try to get students interested in themselves,” said Brian French, regents professor at the Washington State University College of Education. French has been working on WARNS for about a decade, since the original version of the assessment was moved from the purview of the court system to Washington State University.\n\n“It’s not meant to be a diagnostic tool,” French said. “It’s not meant to be a labeling tool. It’s really a tool that says: Let’s start a conversation with you.”\n\nWARNS asks kids detailed questions about their relationships with their peers, mental health issues, family environment, school engagement and more. Once a student finishes the assessment, both the student and the school receive a set of scores indicating their risk level for different outcomes.\n\nJames Wise, assistant principal at Sunnyside High School in Yakima County, has been using the system for the past seven years and said WARNS helps districts get past basic questions like: “How was your day?”\n\n“What the WARNS does is it has carefully crafted questions around lots of different areas of a kid’s life, and so we’re able to tease out the details without having a one-hour conversation with the kid that feels more like an interrogation,” Wise said.\n\nOverwhelming research shows a connection between chronic absenteeism and worse student outcomes, but nearly a quarter of school districts surveyed nationwide by the Rand Corporation and the Center on Reinventing Public Education said their strategies to combat the issue haven’t been particularly effective.\n\nFrench said he can’t directly link WARNS to a drop in absenteeism because there are so many other factors that can affect the issue. But one 2014 study of an eastern Washington school district, led by Paul Strand, a psychology professor at WSU who works with French on WARNS, found that when paired with “truancy reduction intervention,” WARNS helped increase graduation rates.\n\n“The WARNS is an excellent tool,” Wise said. “But there’s nothing more important than having a relationship with the student and using the relationship to meet their needs.”\n\nWashington has one of the highest absenteeism rates in the country, according to a recent analysis from the Associated Press and Stanford University educational economist Thomas Dee. That’s despite a state law called the Becca Bill requiring all children between 8 and 18 to attend school regularly.\n\nThere isn’t one reason why so many kids aren’t in school, said Strand, but he pointed to mental health, lack of affordable child care — which forces older kids to stay home and take care of their younger siblings — and access to transportation as some reasons they’ve seen in their work.\n\nChildren are also more likely to have higher risk scores on the WARNS if they’re facing other barriers, Strand said, like students with disabilities.\n\nSome districts have found the assessment so useful, they’ve started using it for broader reasons, not just absenteeism. At Sunnyside, Wise said they use WARNS whenever a school social worker identifies a kid who needs additional support.\n\n“The question really is about ‘How can we help this kid engage in school, not just attend?” Wise said. “And so if the kids get into fights, you want to figure out why. If the kid’s skipping, you want to figure out why.”\n\n“If you can figure out the ‘why,’ you can help them overcome the situation they’re in. It didn’t make sense to only ask ‘why’ when it came to attendance. It makes sense to ask ‘why’ all over the place,” Wise said.\n\nThe WARNS team is using feedback from districts like Wise’s to improve the tool. Districts are asking them to consider highlighting student strengths, for example, to help motivate students and recognize what they’re good at. They’re also considering creating an assessment tool for the elementary level, which they say will have to involve parents.\n\nSchools outside Washington have started using WARNS too, including in Minnesota, Virginia and Wisconsin. The WARNS team received a $1.4 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education in 2021 to help ramp up their operations.\n\n“Our goal is to make it as easy as possible to have those helpful conversations with students,” French said. “I’m hoping our team in WARNS is making some kind of small progress on the situation in the state.”\n\n– By Grace Deng",
      "# [Instagram introduces mandatory 'Teen Accounts' with built-in limits, parental controls by Katie Kindelan, ABC News on 2024-09-17](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Family/instagram-introduces-teen-accounts/story?id=113734038)\nFor the first time in its history, Instagram on Tuesday announced the launch of accounts designed specifically for teenage users with built-in privacy protections.\n\nThe new accounts, called \"Teen Accounts,\" will be automatic for all Instagram users under the age of 18, both for teens already using the app and for those signing up.\n\nBy default, Instagram users younger than 16 will need a parent's permission to change their account settings.\n\nThe changes -- expected to impact tens of millions of users -- were announced by Instagram head Adam Mosseri in a live interview on \"Good Morning America.\"\n\n\"They're an automatic set of protections for teens that try to proactively address the top concerns that we've heard from parents about teens online,\" Mosseri said on \"GMA.\" \"Things like who can contact them, what content they see and how much time they spend on their device ... all without requiring any involvement from the parent.\"\n\nMosseri said the rollout of Teen Accounts starts Tuesday with new users signing up for the app, while existing teen users will see their accounts switch to the new Teen Accounts model within 60 days.\n\nAmong the changes put in place by Instagram include a new privacy setting that, by default, places all teen users in private accounts. In order to switch to a public account, teens under age 16 will need a parent's permission.\n\nUnder the private account setting, teens will need to accept new followers and only people whom they accept as followers can see their content and interact with them.\n\nIn addition, teen users will now automatically only be able to message with people they follow, or are already connected to, and parents will have a new tool in their settings that allows them to see with whom their teen has recently been messaging.\n\nWith the new accounts, teens will have the power to choose the age-appropriate topics they want to see more of on Instagram, like sports or art, and parents will also be able to see the topics their teens choose.\n\nIn order to limit the amount of time spent on Instagram, all Teen Accounts will be placed in \"sleep mode\" between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., while parents can also adjust their child's time settings -- including limiting access completely overnight -- in the parental supervision tool.\n\nAnother change for Teen Accounts is that they will automatically be placed in more restrictive content settings, which will limit the content they see in search functions like Reels or Explore from accounts they don't follow, according to Instagram.\n\nMosseri said Instagram has protections in place to block teens from lying about their age, including requiring teens to verify their age if they try to change their birthday and not allowing new accounts with different birthdays from the same device.\n\nAntigone Davis, vice president and global head of safety for Meta, the parent company of Instagram, told \"GMA\" the company is also implementing new ways to verify users' ages.\n\n\"We are building technology to try to identify if you've lied about your age and then move you into those stricter settings,\" Davis said. \"This is a challenging area for industry, which is why, on top of building that technology that will try to identify age liars and put them into those protective settings, we also will have moments where, if we get a strong signal, we will ask you to age verify.\"\n\nDavis said that parents will be able to monitor their teens' account and adjust their settings from their own Instagram accounts.\n\n'The idea is to really make it simpler, so they [parents] have their own center that they can go and look and see what the privacy setting is for their teen,\" she said.\n\nChanges spurred by parents and teens\n\nThe changes for teen Instagram users come amid mounting evidence showing the dangers of social media for young users.\n\nSocial media use is linked with symptoms of depression and anxiety, body image issues, and lower life satisfaction for some teens and adolescents, research shows. Heavy social media use around the time adolescents go through puberty is linked with lower life satisfaction one year later, one large study found.\n\nU.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who previously issued an advisory highlighting a crisis in youth mental health, has said he believes being on social media \"does a disservice\" to kids early in their teen years. Noting the crisis among kids, the American Psychological Association last year issued the first guidance of its kind to help teens use social media safely.\n\nIn January, while testifying at a Senate hearing, Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, publicly apologized to parents, caregivers and loved ones of young people who they say were harmed due to social media use, telling them, \"It's terrible. No one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.\"\n\nIn his apology, Zuckerberg also emphasized Meta's efforts on safety, adding, \"This is why we invest so much and are going to continue doing industry-leading efforts to make sure that no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer.\"\n\nBoth Mosseri and Davis said the newly-announced changes to Instagram for teen users came after conversations with parents and teenagers around the world.\n\n\"I think we have a responsibility to make sure that Instagram is a safe place for teens to explore their interests and connect with their friends,\" Mosseri said. \"But this change is really focused not on any litigations, but on parental concerns.\"\n\nMosseri added that Instagram views parents as the company's \"north star.\"\n\n\"They've been clear and what they're most concerned about, and we're trying to proactively address those concerns without requiring their involvement,\" he said of parents. \"But if a parent wants to get involved, we've also built some robust tools to allow them to shape the experience into what's most appropriate for their teen, because at the end of the day, a parent always knows what's best for their child.\"",
