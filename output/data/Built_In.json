      "# [Robotics: What Are Robots? by Sam Daley on 2019-04-12](https://builtin.com/robotics)\nRobotics is an interdisciplinary sector of science and engineering dedicated to the design, construction and use of mechanical robots. Our guide will give you a concrete grasp of robotics, including different types of robots and how they’re being applied across industries.\n\nWhat Is Robotics?\n\nRobotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that produces machines, called robots, that replicate or substitute for human actions. Robots perform basic and repetitive tasks with greater efficiency and accuracy than humans, making them ideal for industries like manufacturing. However, the introduction of artificial intelligence in robotics has given robots the ability to handle increasingly complex situations in various industries.\n\nWhat Is a Robot?\n\nA robot is a programmable machine that can complete a task, while the term robotics describes the field of study focused on developing robots and automation. Each robot has a different level of autonomy. These levels range from human-controlled bots that carry out tasks to fully-autonomous bots that perform tasks without any external influences.\n\nIn terms of etymology, the word ‘robot’ is derived from the Czech word robota, which means “forced labor.” The word first appeared in the 1920 play R.U.R., in reference to the play’s characters who were mass-produced workers incapable of creative thinking.\n\nRobotics Aspects\n\nMechanical Construction\n\nThe mechanical aspect of a robot helps it complete tasks in the environment for which it’s designed. For example, the Mars 2020 Rover’s wheels are individually motorized and made of titanium tubing that help it firmly grip the harsh terrain of the red planet.\n\nElectrical Components\n\nRobots need electrical components that control and power the machinery. Essentially, an electric current — a battery, for example — is needed to power a large majority of robots.\n\nSoftware Program\n\nRobots contain at least some level of computer programming. Without a set of code telling it what to do, a robot would just be another piece of simple machinery. Inserting a program into a robot gives it the ability to know when and how to carry out a task.\n\nWhat Are the Main Components of a Robot?\n\nControl System\n\nComputation includes all of the components that make up a robot’s central processing unit, often referred to as its control system. Control systems are programmed to tell a robot how to utilize its specific components, similar in some ways to how the human brain sends signals throughout the body, in order to complete a specific task. These robotic tasks could comprise anything from minimally invasive surgery to assembly line packing.\n\nSensors\n\nSensors provide a robot with stimuli in the form of electrical signals that are processed by the controller and allow the robot to interact with the outside world. Common sensors found within robots include video cameras that function as eyes, photoresistors that react to light and microphones that operate like ears. These sensors allow the robot to capture its surroundings and process the most logical conclusion based on the current moment and allows the controller to relay commands to the additional components.\n\nActuators\n\nA device can only be considered to be a robot if it has a movable frame or body. Actuators are the components that are responsible for this movement. These components are made up of motors that receive signals from the control system and move in tandem to carry out the movement necessary to complete the assigned task. Actuators can be made of a variety of materials, such as metal or elastic, and are commonly operated by use of compressed air (pneumatic actuators) or oil (hydraulic actuators) but come in a variety of formats to best fulfill their specialized roles.\n\nPower Supply\n\nLike the human body requires food in order to function, robots require power. Stationary robots, such as those found in a factory, may run on AC power through a wall outlet but more commonly, robots operate via an internal battery. Most robots utilize lead-acid batteries for their safe qualities and long shelf life while others may utilize the more compact but also more expensive silver-cadmium variety. Safety, weight, replaceability and lifecycle are all important factors to consider when designing a robot’s power supply.\n\nSome potential power sources for future robotic development also include pneumatic power from compressed gasses, solar power, hydraulic power, flywheel energy storage organic garbage through anaerobic digestion and nuclear power.\n\nEnd Effectors\n\nEnd effectors are the physical, typically external components that allow robots to finish carrying out their tasks. Robots in factories often have interchangeable tools like paint sprayers and drills, surgical robots may be equipped with scalpels and other kinds of robots can be built with gripping claws or even hands for tasks like deliveries, packing, bomb diffusion and much more.\n\nHow Do Robots Work?\n\nSome robots are pre-programmed to perform specific functions, meaning they operate in a controlled environment where they do simple, monotonous tasks — like a mechanical arm on an automotive assembly line.\n\nOther robots are autonomous, operating independently of human operators to carry out tasks in open environments. In order to work, they use sensors to perceive the world around them, and then employ decision-making structures (usually a computer) to take the optimal next step based on their data and mission.\n\nRobots may also work by using wireless networks to enable human control from a safe distance. These teleoperated robots usually work in extreme geographical conditions, weather and circumstances. Examples of teleoperated robots are the human-controlled submarines used to fix underwater pipe leaks during the BP oil spill or drones used to detect landmines on a battlefield.\n\nTypes of Robotics\n\nHumanoid Robots\n\nHumanoid robots are robots that look like or mimic human behavior. These robots usually perform human-like activities (like running, jumping and carrying objects), and are sometimes designed to look like us, even having human faces and expressions. Two of the most prominent examples of humanoid robots are Hanson Robotics’ Sophia and Boston Dynamics’ Atlas.\n\nCobots\n\nCobots, or collaborative robots, are robots designed to work alongside humans. These robots prioritize safety by using sensors to remain aware of their surroundings, executing slow movements and ceasing actions when their movements are obstructed. Cobots typically perform simple tasks, freeing up humans to address more complex work.\n\nIndustrial Robots\n\nIndustrial robots automate processes in manufacturing environments like factories and warehouses. Possessing at least one robotic arm, these robots are made to handle heavy objects while moving with speed and precision. As a result, industrial robots often work in assembly lines to boost productivity.\n\nMedical Robots\n\nMedical robots assist healthcare professionals in various scenarios and support the physical and mental health of humans. These robots rely on AI and sensors to navigate healthcare facilities, interact with humans and execute precise movements. Some medical robots can even converse with humans, encouraging people’s social and emotional growth.\n\nAgricultural Robots\n\nAgricultural robots handle repetitive and labor-intensive tasks, allowing farmers to use their time and energy more efficiently. These robots also operate in greenhouses, where they monitor crops and help with harvests. Agricultural robots come in many forms, ranging from autonomous tractors to drones that collect data for farmers to analyze.\n\nMicrorobotics\n\nMicrorobotics is the study and development of robots on a miniature scale. Often no bigger than a millimeter, microrobots can vary in size, depending on the situation. Biotech researchers typically use microrobotics to monitor and treat diseases, with the goal of improving diagnostic tools and creating more targeted solutions.\n\nAugmenting Robots\n\nAugmenting robots, also known as VR robots, either enhance current human capabilities or replace the capabilities a human may have lost. The field of robotics for human augmentation is a field where science fiction could become reality very soon, with bots that have the ability to redefine the definition of humanity by making humans faster and stronger. Some examples of current augmenting robots are robotic prosthetic limbs or exoskeletons used to lift hefty weights.\n\nSoftware Bots\n\nSoftware bots, or simply ‘bots,’ are computer programs which carry out tasks autonomously. They are not technically considered robots. One common use case of software robots is a chatbot, which is a computer program that simulates conversation both online and over the phone and is often used in customer service scenarios. Chatbots can either be simple services that answer questions with an automated response or more complex digital assistants that learn from user information.\n\nRobotics Applications\n\nBeginning as a major boon for manufacturers, robotics has become a mainstay technology for a growing number of industries.\n\nManufacturing\n\nIndustrial robots can assemble products, sort items, perform welds and paint objects. They may even be used to fix and maintain other machines in a factory or warehouse.\n\nHealthcare\n\nMedical robots transport medical supplies, perform surgical procedures and offer emotional support to those going through rehabilitation.\n\nCompanionship\n\nSocial robots can support children with learning disabilities and act as a therapeutic tool for people with dementia. They also have business applications like providing in-person customer service in hotels and moving products around warehouses.\n\nHome Use\n\nConsumers may be most familiar with the Roomba and other robot vacuum cleaners. However, other home robots include lawn-mowing robots and personal robot assistants that can play music, engage with children and help with household chores.\n\nSearch and Rescue\n\nSearch and rescue robots can save those stuck in flood waters, deliver supplies to those stranded in remote areas and put out fires when conditions become too extreme for firefighters.\n\nPros and Cons of Robotics\n\nRobotics comes with a number of benefits and drawbacks.\n\nPros of Robotics\n\nIncreased accuracy. Robots can perform movements and actions with greater precision and accuracy than humans.\n\nEnhanced productivity. Robots can work at a faster pace than humans and don’t get tired, leading to more consistent and higher-volume production.\n\nImproved safety. Robots can take on tasks and operate in environments unsafe for humans, protecting workers from injuries.\n\nRapid innovation. Many robots are equipped with sensors and cameras that collect data, so teams can quickly refine processes.\n\nGreater cost-efficiency. Gains in productivity may make robots a more cost-efficient option for businesses compared to hiring more human workers.\n\nCons of Robotics\n\nJob losses. Robotic process automation may put human employees out of work, especially those who don’t have the skills to adapt to a changing workplace.\n\nLimited creativity. Robots may not react well to unexpected situations since they don’t have the same problem-solving skills as humans.\n\nData security risks. Robots can be hit with cyber attacks, potentially exposing large amounts of data if they’re connected to the Internet of Things.\n\nMaintenance costs. Robots can be expensive to repair and maintain, and faulty equipment can lead to disruptions in production and revenue losses.\n\nEnvironmental waste. Extracting raw materials to build robots and having to discard disposable parts can lead to more environmental waste and pollution.\n\nFuture of Robotics\n\nThe evolution of AI has major implications for the future of robotics. In factories, AI can be combined with robotics to produce digital twins and design simulations to help companies improve their workflows. Advanced AI also gives robots increased autonomy. For example, drones could deliver packages to customers without any human intervention. In addition, robots could be outfitted with generative AI tools like ChatGPT, resulting in more complex human-robot conversations.\n\nAs robots’ intelligence has shifted, so too have their appearances. Humanoid robots are designed to visually appeal to humans in various settings while understanding and responding to emotions, carrying objects and navigating environments. With these forms and abilities, robots can become major contributors in customer service, manufacturing, logistics and healthcare, among other industries.\n\nWhile the spread of robotics has stoked fears over job losses due to automation, robots could simply change the nature of human jobs. Humans may find themselves collaborating with robots, letting their robotic counterparts handle repetitive tasks while they focus on more difficult problems. Either way, humans will need to adapt to the presence of robots as robotics continues to progress alongside other technologies like AI and deep learning.\n\nHistory of Robotics\n\nRobotics as a concept goes back to ancient times. The ancient Greeks combined automation and engineering to create the Antikythera, a handheld device that predicted eclipses. Centuries later, Leonardo Da Vinci designed a mechanical knight now known as “Leonardo’s Robot.” But it was the rise of manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution that highlighted the need for widespread automation.\n\nFollowing William Grey Walter’s development of the first autonomous robots in 1948, George Devol created the first industrial robotic arm known as Unimate. It began operating at a GM facility in 1959. In 1972, the Stanford Research Institute designed Shakey — the first AI-powered robot. Shakey used cameras and sensors to collect data from its surroundings and inform its next moves.\n\nThe ability of robots to perceive their surroundings led researchers to explore whether they could also perceive human emotions. In the late 1990s, MIT’s Dr. Cynthia Breazeal built Kismet, a robotic head that used facial features to express and respond to human emotions. This predecessor to social robots opened the door for future robots like Roomba and consumer-centric inventions like Alexa and other voice assistants.\n\nRobots took another leap forward in 2012 due to a breakthrough in deep learning. Armed with volumes of digital images, British AI expert Geoffrey Hinton and his team successfully trained a system of neural networks to sort over one million images while making few errors. Since then, companies have incorporated deep learning into their technologies, promising more possibilities for robotics.\n\n1700s\n\n(1737) Jacques de Vaucanson builds the first biomechanical automaton on record.

      "# [What Is Logistics? Logistics Definition and Examples.](https://builtin.com/logistics)\nWhat Is Logistics?\n\nLogistics is the process of coordinating how goods and products are obtained, stored and distributed. Manufacturers rely on logistics while overseeing complex operations in order to maintain efficiency, reduce costs and ensure that consumers’ needs are met.\n\nDue to the prominence of e-commerce companies, like Amazon, logistics embodies more than the actual movement of products from one place to another.\n\nLogistics Definition\n\nLogistics refers to the process of managing resources, including how they are transported, stored and received. Logistics often goes hand in hand with the global supply chain.\n\nAn important part of logistics is the steps taken in order to maximize customer satisfaction. This includes elements such as demand planning, order fulfillment, inventory management and customer service operations. These elements ensure that the goods consumers need are stocked and orders are fulfilled in a timely manner.\n\nLogistics management software has aided the expansion of what the logistics industry entails and how goods are brought to consumers. Some examples of software for the logistics industry include transportation management systems, enterprise resource planning software, yard management systems and warehouse management systems. The growth of this technology has created a need for specialized roles and companies focused on building and implementing logistics software.\n\nAs technology continues to transform our world, its influence on the logistics industry will only become greater, prompting a shift in how companies quickly and efficiently deliver their products to consumers.\n\nSupply Chain Management vs. Logistics\n\nSupply chain management and logistics are often thought of as one in the same, but the terms actually capture two distinct parts of what it means to move resources.\n\nSupply chain management is the larger network that connects global vendors, transportation companies, distributors and warehouses. This network functions as the framework that logistics works under.\n\nLogistics is the process companies undertake to deliver goods to consumers. This process involves purchasing and delivering materials, packaging and shipping goods as well as transporting goods and products to distributors.\n\nWhy Logistics Is Important\n\nLogistics may not be the first thing that comes to mind when a purchase is made online or in a brick-and-mortar store, but it is undeniably intertwined with everything we buy. Logistical considerations affect global supply chains, what items are in stock and when as well as where manufacturers chose to build their facilities. These influences are just one way that logistics displays importance in our global economy.\n\nUtilizing logistics properly is essential to the function of businesses across the globe — and effectively managed logistics typically leads to positive business outcomes. With the growing complexity of the global supply chain, properly implemented and managed logistics are more important than ever.\n\nThe importance of logistics also stretches to simplifying communication and reducing costs. Effective logistics help foster relationships between suppliers, shipping services and warehousers through automated systems. The connectivity of logistics improves delivery and fulfillment of orders, which in turn reduces overhead costs. Costs are also reduced by the ability to use logistical systems to purchase goods based on supply forecasts and improved inventory management.\n\nBest Logistics Companies Hiring for Open RolesView Top Logistics Companies Hiring Now\n\nTypes of Logistics\n\nThe logistics industry has transformed over the past century. During the 1960s, the supply chain was indelibly changed when IBM developed the world’s first computerized inventory management and forecasting system, which made it simpler to track orders, inventory and distribution. Since then, the industry has been propelled even further into the future, bringing with it an entirely new perspective on how we exchange goods across the globe.\n\nTypes of Logistics Companies\n\ne-Commerce logistics\n\nFreight logistics\n\nThird-party logistics\n\nCarrier logistics\n\nFreight forwarders\n\nToday, the logistics realm is heavily influenced by AI and machine learning, which many logistics companies use to offer more accurate forecasting and enhanced order management. With these technological advances and more, the supply chain has been given the chance to prosper worldwide.\n\nLogistics in e-Commerce\n\nGiven the rise of e-commerce and the rapid growth of the online ordering space, logistics has become one of the world’s fastest-growing industries. Many organizations have emerged in response to logistics’ continuous transformation, dedicated to optimizing the supply chain in unimaginable ways. Perhaps the most well-known logistics leader to have emerged over the past few decades is e-commerce giant Amazon. While Amazon was initially founded as an online marketplace for books, the company has become a household name across the globe, altering the way in which products are transported and delivered to consumers.\n\nAmazon has become famous for its logistics strategy, which is made possible by the company’s global network of distribution, sortation and fulfillment centers. Amazon’s same-day and next-day delivery model rests on a complex logistics framework. Products are delivered to the company’s fulfillment centers before being moved to sortation centers. Once goods have made it through Amazon’s sortation centers, they are loaded onto a wide range of transportation modes, which can include the company’s own fleet of delivery trucks and airplanes.\n\nThird-Party Logistics\n\nAmazon has entirely redefined the logistics landscape, yet it’s not the only major third party logistics (3PL) provider making waves. Companies like UPS and FedEx have played a significant role in the transformation of logistics. These companies are capable of transporting goods from their point of origin, warehousing products and packaging them. Working with 3PL providers offers numerous advantages for both small and large businesses including the ability to obtain better rates, easily expand into new markets and improve customer service.\n\nLogistics in Freight Shipping\n\nWhile 3PL providers are capable of handling the entirety of a company’s supply chain operations, the different components of the logistics process can be carried out by individual players. For instance, freight companies solely handle the physical transportation of goods, while freight forwarders are dedicated to optimizing transport solutions and handling necessary documentation. In this sense, logistics could be seen as a complex web of moving parts, which operate in tandem with one another in order to boost efficiency and reduce costs within the supply chain.\n\nBy way of example, Flexport has developed an operating model designed to simplify global freight forwarding, while Transfix has created a marketplace that connects shippers with a national network of carriers.\n\nRead NextFragmented Tech Is the Way Forward in Hospitality\n\nLogistic Tech Developments\n\nGiven the logistics industry’s seemingly endless transformation, logistics management is naturally made up of many different elements. These components include the planning, procurement and coordination of manufacturing materials, strategizing the development of a product and reclaiming materials and supplies involved in the manufacturing of a product. For logistics managers, keeping track of the many different aspects of a supply chain can be nearly impossible. Luckily, logistics tech has successfully reshaped the industry, turning it into a robust sector fueled by the rise of innovative new technologies.\n\nTop Logistics Tech Companies\n\nFourKites\n\nproject44\n\nMotive\n\nZipline\n\nFlexport\n\nTransfix\n\nArrive Logistics\n\nAI and Optimization in Logistics\n\nAs the demand for online delivery grows and consumers’ expectations become larger, the need to optimize logistics has never been greater. As a result, software developers have set to work creating platforms designed to make the supply chain more manageable. Real-time visibility software providers such as FourKites, project44 and FreightVerify empower supply chain operators to simply identify issues and quickly resolve them, saving organizations huge amounts of time during which they can focus on other aspects of the logistics process. Likewise, fleet management company Motive has made it easier to track cargo and drivers while improving efficiency and safety along the supply chain.\n\nConsidering all of the work that goes into Amazon’s e-commerce services, it may come as no surprise that the company relies heavily on the latest technology in order to accomplish its consumer delivery goals. Amazon has been using AI to power its product recommendations for years. The company has also adopted machine learning to build the handheld virtual assistant, Amazon Echo.\n\nWarehouse Automation in Logistics\n\nAmazon doesn’t solely use technology to maximize the customer experience. In fact, the company’s technological expertise extends to its packaging and delivery services. The e-commerce company made headlines in 2012 when it introduced automation into its supply chain upon acquiring Kiva Systems. Today, Amazon’s warehouses are filled with thousands of robots built to optimize the picking and packing process.\n\nAmazon isn’t the only logistics leader that has unlocked the potential of robotics. In fact, the warehouse automation space has grown tremendously over the past several years and is expected to become increasingly more valuable over time. The growth of this sector is attributed largely to the steady rise of e-commerce, which has ignited the need to send products out quickly while lowering operating costs. The popularity of online grocery shopping in particular has bolstered the growth of warehouse automation, as online grocery retailers have been forced to meet consumers’ ever-increasing demands while competing with brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles in Logistics\n\nAs warehouse automation continues to infiltrate the logistics industry, autonomous vehicles are becoming a supply chain essential. For companies like Amazon, self-driving vehicles are not only profitable within the warehouse, as they harbor the potential to make on-road delivery faster and more efficient. Companies like Starship Technologies are developing revolutionary new ways to autonomously transport goods, thus unleashing new possibilities within the logistics realm.\n\nDrones in Logistics\n\nAlongside the emergence of autonomous vehicles, the commercial use of drones has opened up new avenues for supply chain management. Within a warehouse setting, drones can be used for aerial inspection and can even carry out maintenance requests, all of which can save manufacturers vast amounts of time.\n\nGiven drones’ ability to quickly transport small items, many tech companies are trying their hand at developing aerial transportation modes. For instance, logistics startup Zipline has created unmanned drones designed to quickly deliver goods, reduce emissions and integrate with existing operations.\n\n3D Printing in Logistics\n\nWhile there are many options when it comes to packaging and delivering goods quickly, supply chain experts are still searching for ways to manufacture products at a speed that meet consumers’ growing expectations. For this reason, 3D printing has entered the logistics space as a possible solution. The process of gathering supplies and producing a product often requires the most time and effort within the supply chain setting.\n\nIf 3D printing were applied to the production process, consumers would have greater control over the supply chain. Potentially, a consumer could place an order for a product and then a local 3D printer shop would quickly create the product before sending it out for delivery. 3D printing could ultimately disrupt the logistics industry, as it offers manufacturers the opportunity to produce complex and customized goods faster than ever before.",

      "# [What Is Wearable Technology? Examples of Wearables](https://builtin.com/wearables)\nWhat Is Wearable Technology?\n\nIt seems like everything nowadays is a smart device. Smart toasters. Smart dog collars. Smart homes. In the age of smart, there is nothing more intelligent or more innovative than the devices being produced by the wearables industry.\n\nWearable devices help collect and analyze real-time personal data that informs us on everything from our health to our workouts. They’ve become extremely popular tools to help us stay informed and in touch with ourselves to the point that almost a quarter of people in the U.S. now sport a wearable device.\n\nWhat Are Wearables?\n\nWearables make up a broad category that includes any device worn or attached to a user’s body. Smart watches, VR headsets and wearable electrocardiograms are a few examples. These devices support purposes related to areas like health and fitness, entertainment and everyday use.\n\nWhat exactly is a wearable? Wearables are electronic devices that are worn on a person — usually close to the skin — in order to accurately relay important medical, biological and exercise data to a database.\n\nWearables have helped make the IoT industry the $594 billion dollar behemoth it is today (the wearables industry itself is expected to balloon to $111 billion by 2027). Apple Watches and Fitbits are classic examples of wearable technology, but those aren’t the only devices being developed today. In addition to smart watches, VR and AR technology, smart jackets and a wide variety of other gadgets are leading us towards a better-connected lifestyle. Each device’s main job is to collect millions of data points that range from how many steps you take to your heart rate.\n\nBenefits of Wearables\n\nThe advancement of wearables has been a welcomed tool for the insurance, healthcare and sports industries for a number of reasons. From encouraging healthier habits to optimizing physical performance, industries have reaped numerous rewards that come with wearable tech.\n\nWearables Improve Healthcare\n\nThe healthcare industry is probably seeing the biggest benefit from wearable technology. Patients who wear these smart devices can measure information ranging from body temperature to blood pressure, which is then relayed to their medical team in real-time. If something looks off, doctors have a quicker way to accurately diagnose and treat a patient. The entire treatment process is now quicker thanks to the data collected by a wearable device because doctors no longer have to run a gamut of tests to determine an illness or disease. They can reference the data collected by a wearable to quickly figure out the cause of the medical mishap.\n\nBest Wearables Companies Hiring NowView the Top Wearables Companies With Open Jobs\n\nWearables Provide More Insights Into Sports and Fitness Performance\n\nHaving all of this health data in real-time is, of course, helping the sports and fitness industries push the boundaries of training. Professional athletes from all over the world maximize their training regimes thanks to the biometric data captured through wearable technology. Elite athletes, from marathon runners to the Golden State Warriors and Liverpool FC, are using smart compression shirts to maximize every move an athlete makes. These smart shirts use a combination of GPS, accelerometers and biomedical sensors to constantly measure the performance of each athlete. Is Liverpool superstar Mo Salah taking the optimal route to a ball? Is NBA all-star Steph Curry maximizing his hydration levels to perform at his peak ability? How can MLB players, like Mike Trout or Kris Bryant, maximize their acceleration out of the batter’s box? Wearable technology is the key to answering these questions and unlocking the optimal potential of world-class athletes.\n\nWearables Increase the Productivity and Health of Workforces\n\nThe business world has benefited from the introduction of wearables to its workforce. Seventy-nine percent of employees who wear a smart device in the office report that the devices are instrumental to their work. Equipping a workforce with wearable devices makes sense for employers. These devices enhance communication, track employee activity, boost job site safety measures and can actually improve the health and quality of life for a workforce. A healthier, happier workforce will then lead to higher rates of employee retention, saving companies thousands, if not millions, of dollars annually.\n\nExamples of Wearable Technologies\n\nHealth and Fitness Wearables\n\nWearables are often associated with the health and wellness sectors. Smart watches, like a Fitbit or Apple Watch, have pioneered the way we track everything from heart rates to our daily steps. Constantly checking in with them has become part of a daily routine for many.\n\nThese watches inherently encourage healthier lifestyles because of the data they collect. Knowing how far you run encourages you to push yourself further to beat your old record. Seeing that you’re almost to your daily 10,000-step goal encourages you to go for a walk around the block. Even tracking your current sleep habits could lead to changes that help you sleep more soundly at night. In a sense, wearable tech is one of the best ways to gamify the health and wellness journey.\n\nLife Insurance Wearables\n\nIn order to promote healthier lifestyles, life insurance companies issue wearables to their customers, who then track their health data. Devices like smart watches and fitness trackers provide details on someone’s activity levels, heart rate and other important health data points. The data collected informs premium prices and can paint a more accurate picture about the overall health of life insurance customers. It’s a much more concrete method rather than relying on a vague metric, such as one’s age, when creating an individual policy.\n\nGaming Wearables\n\nGaming is one of the biggest frontiers for wearable technology. Virtual reality (VR) headsets are the most common form of wearable devices in the industry. VR headsets, like the Oculus Rift or the Playstation VR, instantly immerse gamers in other-worldly experiences from the second they strap in. Do you want to know how it would feel to fight with Lightsabers? Maybe you really want to live out your adrenaline junky dreams of racing in the Indianapolis 500? VR wearables are bringing awe-inspiring experiences like these to gamers all over the world.\n\nWearable technologies taking off in the gaming industry are haptic devices. These smart wearables provide tactile feedback to a gamer in real time. This means that a device takes advantage of a gamer’s sense of touch by providing force or vibrations to a user. To put it simply, haptic vests, gloves or suits make gaming more realistic — a gamer can now feel actual recoil after shooting their virtual weapon or can even experience real feedback of what it feels like to dribble a virtual basketball. Though still in its infancy, haptic technology is poised to make the future of gaming, and wearables, more entertaining and realistic.\n\nFashion Wearables\n\nIt only makes sense that wearable tech has started to permeate fashion culture. Athletes wear full-body suits, equipped with hundreds of little IoT sensors, to measure their every move. The data gathered will help them to better optimize their swing, shot or kick. The consumer wearable technology clothing industry is still relatively new, albeit already intriguing. Smart jackets are being made to automatically cool or warm the body based on body temperatures taken from sensors throughout the jacket. Smart rings are giving people a stylish way to track their steps or measure their sleep habits. Our pants might one day become smart enough to use the thermal energy our bodies naturally produce to charge our cell phones. Wearable devices in fashion demonstrate that tech can be smart and sophisticated all at once.\n\nTravel Wearables\n\nThe ability of smart wearables to immerse users in virtual environments has made them a vital tool for the travel industry. With VR technology, companies can provide in-depth virtual tours of hotel rooms, local landmarks and other potential destinations. People can then make more informed decisions about where they choose to stay and visit, resulting in a higher-quality travel experience for customers.\n\nMany airlines also cater to wearable devices, allowing customers to store tickets and boarding passes in a digital wallet like Apple Wallet. If someone is wearing a smart watch, they can pull up any necessary passes for a faster entry and boarding process.\n\nEducation Wearables\n\nEducation has had to adapt to the digital age, and wearable tech has helped the industry catch up with the latest developments. Smart glasses and VR headsets enable organizations to train students and employees through simulations and virtual environments. Users are immersed in a real-life scenario, allowing them to spend more time learning by doing rather than listening to a lecture or presentation.\n\nIn addition, brain sensor headbands track when someone’s mind is stressed and relaxed. Educators can leverage this device to learn when students are pushing their minds too much and teach them how to remain calm while taking in new experiences and knowledge.\n\nLogistics Wearables\n\nAnother beneficiary of wearables is the logistics industry, which relies on wearable tech to develop more efficient operations. Smart glasses like Google Glass enable warehouse workers to quickly scan barcodes, pull up information from a database and make updates along the way. This process eliminates the need for workers to keep going back to a physical computer, saving them time as they organize packages and items.\n\nSome VR glasses go as far as to help workers determine their location in a large warehouse, mapping out the optimal route to travel between two points. These glasses can also reveal the best ways to organize packages for maximized storage without crushing lighter items. All these abilities make wearable devices a must-have for logistics companies.",
      "# [A Look Into the Gaming Industry: Types of Video Games and Gaming Jobs](https://builtin.com/gaming)\nGaming Industry Overview\n\nThe gaming industry, a current $200 billion behemoth, is arguably one of the most important and innovative sectors in tech today. Its importance to culture, social networking and entertainment cannot be understated. The term “entertainment industry” is no longer reserved for Hollywood and the movie industry because gaming is now providing one of the most immersive and awe-inspiring forms of entertainment to more than three billion people around the globe.\n\nNobody could imagine what the gaming industry would blossom into when they were messing around with Pong joysticks in their basements and competing against their friends for the highest Pac-Man scores in the 1970s and ‘80s. These simple games would turn out to be the bedrock of today’s gaming industry and instant cultural phenomena.\n\nPioneered by evergrowing gaming companies, the current gaming industry is pushing the boundaries of technology to create cutting-edge and highly immersive entertainment experiences. Not only do we have the continuous advent of new consoles, PCs and devices that are putting us right into the game, but we also have the opportunity to watch some of the best gamers in the world compete in the esports arena and online through streaming platforms like Twitch and Mixer.\n\nGaming Platforms\n\nThe gaming wars of today are just heating up. The battle over console gaming is being waged by Microsoft (Xbox), Sony (Playstation) and Nintendo (Switch). These platforms are pushing the absolute boundaries of technology by offering gamers state-of-the-art graphics, speeds and processing powers.\n\nTraditional console makers, like Microsoft, will likely have to compete with cloud gaming platforms whose games available to those anywhere with any decent internet connection. Even Netflix is getting in on the gaming action. Additionally, PC gaming has opened up a world of opportunities for gamers who are looking for extra ease-of-use and dexterity when casually playing (or competing in) their favorite games.\n\nBest Gaming Companies With Open JobsView Top Gaming Companies Hiring Now\n\nEsports\n\nPicture your favorite sport. All sports, whether it’s soccer, basketball or baseball, have many things in common: passionate fans, sold-out stadiums, engaging commentators and world-class athletes. The same thing is true in the world of esports. esports athletes are essentially the Michael Jordans of their profession, but instead of dunking on opponents on a court, they’re outwitting, outmaneuvering and outplaying their opponents in virtual worlds. Thousands of screaming fans pack the arena to root on their teams who are sitting on stage clicking away for a chance at a title, while millions more watch online around the world.\n\nBy 2025, esports is projected to garner more than 640 million viewers worldwide, with about 318 million of those viewers specifically falling into the category of esports enthusiasts. With a growing fanbase that may rival any professional sport on earth, it’s no wonder that cultural icons and savvy investors, like basketball legend Michael Jordan, rapper Drake and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, all own at least partial stakes in esports teams.\n\nVideo Game Streaming\n\nStreaming has also been a massive success for the gaming industry and gamers alike. Platforms that support streaming like Twitch and Youtube Gaming give individual gamers the opportunity to livestream their in-game play to subscribers all over the world.\n\nThis innovation has allowed millions of streamers to gain a fanbase, interact with one another and monetize their gaming skills. Streaming has become uber-popular to the point where Twitch alone, the most-watched game streaming platform, garnered almost 1.5 billion minutes of watchtime in 2021. Breakout successes in the streaming industry, like Tyler “Ninja” Blevins, have been able to make upwards of $10 million a year just through the fans and endorsement deals that come with running a popular streaming profile.\n\nThe meteoric rise of the gaming industry is just getting started. Born from humble beginnings, today’s gaming sector is ready to take on any other in tech for the title of the most innovative industry. What makes gaming so special is that it’s not only immersive and entertaining, but it’s inclusive and expansive as well. There is a game and a way to play for almost every human, which makes gaming one of the most beloved industries in the world.\n\nGaming Equipment and Technology\n\nConsole Gaming\n\nConsole gaming is the original (and probably most well-known) form of digital gaming. In the early days, Nintendo and Sega dominated the market for consoles. Today, Xbox and Playstation have become the two most popular consoles, offering millions of players the ability to experience the latest in gaming technology.\n\nConsoles have been a good indicator of the tech market as a whole. In the beginning, consoles were simple joysticks just technologically-ept enough to run simple games like Pong. Now, consoles, like the new Xbox Series X, have specially designed microchips that process images and power as efficiently as possible, all the while, being designed for 8K television screens. Gaming consoles are truly pushing the limits of consumer entertainment technology.\n\nPC Gaming\n\nPCs have had a meteoric rise in gameplay with almost 1.8 billion people using computers as their gaming tool of choice by the end of 2022. Gaming computers are all about efficiency. Gaming PCs have their own dedicated RAM space, GPUs and cooling systems that help to efficiently run games in real-time. These bulked-up computers can handle graphically demanding games and can even make it easier for streamers who need a reliable system to manage gaming at a high level and livestreaming their gameplay at the same time. Games like Fortnite, League of Legends and Minecraft have made gaming one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world today.\n\nQuantum computing is a sector to look out for when it comes to gaming. Still in its infancy, quantum computing has the ability to completely upend the gaming industry (and world) as we know it. These computers dwarf anything that computers can do now, and this technology is primed to make an impact in the gaming industry. Because quantum computers have unfathomable amounts of power and information storage, they’re able to render the best graphics imaginable in real time. These computers also fix a huge problem currently plaguing the gaming industry; predictability. Who wants to play a game where they know exactly what happens? A quantum computer’s massive storage of algorithms could actually make gaming unpredictable and unique for each gamer.\n\nBest E-Sports Companies With Open RolesView Top E-Sports Companies Hiring Now\n\nCloud Gaming\n\nCloud gaming is the newest type of video game technology making headlines. Imagine Netflix, but for gaming. You scroll through a library of games, choose which game you want and automatically start playing the game. No discs and no load times. Play on your phone, iPad or console. Cloud-based gaming platforms aim to make the whole gaming experience seamless and easy to play from anywhere at any time.\n\nCloud gaming is such a threat to traditional console gaming that Microsoft’s head of gaming, Phil Spencer, stated that Xbox is no longer concerned about competition from Nintendo or Playstation in 2020. Rather, they’re more focused on competing with the ultra-fast cloud platforms being hosted by companies like Amazon and Google. It is worth noting, however, that Google’s cloud-based gaming platform, Stadia, is shutting down in 2023.\n\nVR/AR Gaming\n\nVirtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are meant to put you right in the middle of the action. Instead of playing from a third person point-of-view, VR drops people into computer-generated environments to make them feel like they’re actually part of the game. VR offers gamers the ability to step into magical worlds and do everything from kick around a soccer ball to fight off hordes of monsters (like in the video above). Additionally, being directly a part of these kinds of digital worlds has made the draw to the metaverse that more appealing.\n\nAugmented reality, on-the-other-hand, adds digital influences to real life. A popular example of AR in gaming is the mobile game Pokémon Go, in which smartphone cameras are used to find and capture virtual creatures in the real world. Gamers might come across a Pikachu in the park or even find a Wartortle on their walk to work.\n\nWhether our reality is augmented or virtual, it’s clear to see that technology is ushering in a completely new way to participate in, and enjoy, video games.\n\nMobile Gaming\n\nMobile gaming makes up about 45 percent of the total market share of the gaming industry with over half of the worldwide population projected to play a mobile game by 2027.\n\nWhy is mobile gaming so popular? It’s easily accessible and has games for every type of gamer. Instead of having to strap on a headset or pop a disc into a console, mobile gaming allows us to play wherever we go and whenever we want. In 2020, it took over television as the preferred choice of leisure activity with people spending more than 6.5 hours per week on mobile games.\n\nThe mobile gaming industry is poised for continual growth as investments in mobile gaming startups have skyrocketed, and creativity opens up avenues for more gamers to enjoy different types of exciting games.\n\nMore On GamingWhat Does the Future of Gaming Look Like?\n\nPopular Gaming Jobs\n\nTypes of Gaming Jobs\n\nVideo game designer\n\nVideo game programmer\n\nVideo game animator\n\nVideo game quality assurance (QA) tester\n\nVideo Game Designer\n\nThat incredibly intricate, expansive and beautifully designed game you’re playing didn’t just appear out of thin air. It took a team of extraordinarily talented video game designers months, even years, to create all the dimensions that a user encounters when playing a game. These designers go through several prototypes of the game before rendering the final, customer-facing version. This requires an ability to be focused and resilient, as well as, an extensive background knowledge of game design techniques, tools and skills.\n\nGame design, especially at the highest level, usually requires a bachelor’s or master’s degree with a vast knowledge in everything from 3D animation to graphic design and even physics. The job outlook for game design looks really steady because of the enormous rise in console, PC and mobile gaming. Cities like Los angeles, New York and Chicago employ the most designers, and a video game designer can make an average of $42,900 a year.\n\nMore On Game Design18 Video Game Design Courses to Know\n\nVideo Game Programmer\n\nVideo game programmers are some of the most sought-after individuals in the gaming industry. They’re the people who bring a designer’s work to life through code. A good video game would be nothing without the hard work of a programmer, who ensures that characters, missions and environments are supposed to interact the way they were intended. Most game programmers usually have at least a bachelor’s degree, but all need a vast competence of C++ (and other languages) in order to thrive.\n\nGaming’s popularity has caused a boom in industry hiring for programmers and it’s not projected to slow down. Job growth isn’t the only positive aspect about being a game programmer. The salary is too.\n\nThe median salary for software developers, which can encompass computer programming and digital design, is more than $109,000 annually. This puts programmers up there with some of the most well-paid positions in the U.S.\n\nVideo Game Animator\n\nYou can’t have a high quality game without video game animators. Game animators combine technology and art to create the interactive images and sequences that help tell the story of the game. Animators work closely with designers and programmers to make sure that a game’s environment interacts in a way that is natural, fun and helps to progress the game. Animators start every project with a basic storyboard, then help bring that story to life through a series of intricate animations. Animators usually have an extensive background in multimedia knowledge, as well as a degree in a field like computer graphics or animation.\n\nThe video game animation field is projected to grow by about 16 percent until 2030, meaning animators can expect to see a healthy salary. On a median salary, animators can expect a value of around $79,000.\n\nVideo Game Testing and Quality Assurance (QA)\n\nGetting paid to play video games might be the ultimate dream job. Luckily, video game testers (better known as video game quality assurance testers) get paid to play, but more importantly, break, video games. Game QA testers push the work of designers, programmers and animators to the limits to ensure that games are free of bugs and allow for gamers to have the freedom to explore in these virtual environments. Testers usually run through what is called matrix testing, where they have to test every permutation and combination of events that could possibly happen in a game to ensure that nothing can break it.\n\nThere are really no essential educational credentials to have when it comes to QA testing video games. However, these testers need to have an eye for details, a tolerance for repetition and an intense passion for the gaming industry. Video game testers are in demand right now (especially in mobile gaming) due to the rapid increase of games being produced. Game and QA testers on average make around $55,000 annually.",
      "# [What Is Marketing? Basics of Marketing & Types](https://builtin.com/marketing)\nWhat Is Marketing?\n\nMarketing is one of, if not the, most important aspects of a business. What good is selling a life-changing product if customers have never heard of it and don’t know anything about it? That’s where capable marketers come in handy. Marketers help companies identify consumer and industry trends, formulate campaigns and captivate audiences by showing how their products shine over others.\n\nWhat, exactly, is marketing? Simply put, marketing is the activity of getting people aware of and interested in a brand and its products, often by promoting its offerings so that customers perceive them as valuable or desirable.\n\nWhat Do Marketers Do?\n\nMarketing is the process of designing, positioning, promoting and distributing a product or service in such a way that consumers see value in it. The role of marketers is often to increase brand awareness and loyalty, attract new customers and retain existing ones, ultimately driving more sales revenue for their company.\n\nWhether we’re conscious of it or not, marketing is all around us. Billboards along a highway, commercials on TV, advertisements in magazines, brand posts on social media and optimized content on a website are all everyday examples of marketing.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of marketing is Nike’s slogan “Just Do It.” Pairing “Just Do It” with world-class athlete spokespeople has proven to be one of the most effective marketing campaigns of the last 30 years. The phrase resonates with competitive athletes and fosters a sense of pushing yourself to be a better athlete (in your Nike gear, of course).\n\nOne of the reasons why marketing is so heavily emphasized is that it often helps inform other aspects of the business. Product, sales and advertising teams are all affected by the efforts of a marketing team. Marketers are responsible for guiding the decisions of these teams with valuable insights, so they compile data in the form of market research.\n\nMarket research entails gathering information about a business’ key demographics, their affinity toward a company’s current products and what other competitors are doing. A marketing team’s in-depth market research informs product and engineering teams on what to create, sales teams on what to sell and advertising teams on what to communicate.\n\nWhy Is Marketing Important?\n\nMarketing is a core component of business success because it impacts a company’s ability to reach customers, develop a brand and generate revenue.\n\nBenefits of Marketing\n\nEstablish a customer base\n\nDevelop a trustworthy brand\n\nAdd value to company products\n\nGenerate higher sales profits\n\nMarketing serves as a lifeline that connects brands to potential customers. Market research enables teams to determine who their target audience is and tailor their messaging and communications accordingly. Businesses can then generate positive perception within consumers who are most likely to find value in and buy their products.\n\nOver time, a well-planned marketing strategy solidifies a company’s brand and messaging. This is crucial because consistent branding tells consumers what to expect from a company and leads to a reputation. If a business can continue to meet these expectations and live up to its reputation, it can create trust among loyal customers and add value to its brand in the eyes of consumers.\n\nThe ultimate reward for these efforts is higher sales, and some of the most effective brands have become synonymous with winning and success. For example, many customers will pay more for a Nike shoe than an anonymous brand’s shoe based on the reputation of the Nike brand alone. An ideal brand highlights what makes a company unique, setting it apart from competitors and transforming its products into coveted items among consumers.\n\nThe 4 Ps of Marketing\n\nThe 4 Ps of marketing is a popular framework for understanding the areas involved in marketing strategy. Sometimes known as the marketing mix, the four Ps of marketing — product, price, place and promotion — are vital to every good marketing campaign.\n\n1. Product\n\nProduct is the good or service that the company is offering. Quality products should be able to satisfy customer needs, while also being able to satisfy customer demand. To effectively market a product, marketers need to pinpoint the value it brings to the customer and why customers would want it. The marketing team can start working on campaigns once these, and many other, questions are answered.\n\n2. Price\n\nPrice is obviously a large factor into whether a consumer buys your product or goes to a competitor. Good marketing teams rely on industry research to appropriately price their products so they boost their market share and reach more happy customers.\n\n3. Place\n\nIt’s critical that marketing professionals take place — both digital and physical — into account when marketing a product. Is a certain product more marketable in-store or online? Should you sell a certain product internationally? How do you market to certain geographical locations? How much does a location’s culture affect your marketing abilities? Marketing teams need to be hyper-aware of where they’re marketing to truly optimize their efforts.\n\n4. Promotion\n\nWhat good is a marketing effort if there isn’t some excitement and build-up around a product? Promotion includes the advertising, promotional strategy and public relations surrounding a product. “Should we create a commercial?” “Should we sponsor a podcast?” “Should we just run a Google Adwords campaign?” With some help from market research, marketing executives should be able to know when to target their audience and through which medium. Executing the promotion step of the marketing mix is vital because it helps to build fervor for a product and brand awareness.\n\nTypes of Marketing\n\nMarketing isn’t just a one-size-fits-all effort. There are different types of marketing campaigns depending on where an organization’s customers spend their time and how they prefer to be reached. Below are eight popular types of marketing:\n\nTypes of Digital Marketing\n\nSocial Media Marketing\n\nSocial media marketing involves the use of social media channels (like Instagram, Twitter and YouTube) to build a brand, connect with customers, drive website traffic and increase sales. These platforms have proven to be excellent marketing tools because they have the ability to educate customers on products, individualize consumer social media experiences and engage with an audience in a way that wasn’t possible before. Marketers rely on data analytics tools to develop targeted ads and timely posts that increase social media engagement with brands and boost revenue.\n\nContent Marketing\n\nContent marketing focuses on creating relevant, interesting and valuable content that attracts an audience and converts them into customers. Marketers are turning to this form of content because it boosts SEO traffic and increases both the quantity and quality of customers. A clever content marketing example is Coca Cola’s “Share a Coke” campaign. The company labeled its iconic bottles and cans with popular names to build stronger bonds with customers. The experiment was such a resounding success in Australia that it ended up being implemented in 80 countries worldwide.\n\nInfluencer Marketing\n\nInfluencer marketing is a type of social media marketing that relies on the virality and popularity of social media influencers, who are paid to promote and endorse products. Essentially, companies pay social media accounts with a large following to include their product in an Instagram, Snapchat or even Facebook post. Influencer marketing has proven profitable for both the company and the influencer. The company potentially gets millions of views of their product and the influencer gets paid. For example, to reach Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s 340 million Instagram followers, companies need to pay about $1 million per post.\n\nSEO Marketing\n\nHave you ever wondered how a search engine picks its search results for your specific query? How does it know what to choose at the top option? Much of that has to do with search engine optimization (SEO). SEO is the practice of increasing unpaid (known as organic) traffic through a variety of technical and content-related practices that make it easier for a search engine to read, understand and rank a site. Optimizing a site’s content, photos or backend procedures provides an uncluttered and efficient experience for both a user and a search engine, resulting in higher rankings. The higher rankings provided by this free method of marketing boosts traffic and converts a casual audience into loyal customers.\n\nTypes of Traditional Marketing\n\nPrint Marketing\n\nPrint marketing involves marketers reaching out to target audiences through offline formats. Brochures, informative flyers and mail advertisements are a few examples of print marketing that marketers hand out or deliver to the homes of consumers. Businesses may also try to reach wider audiences by placing ads in magazines, newspapers and other publications. While marketing teams focus on producing concise written content, they must also determine how to pair text with visuals. The most effective print marketing materials complement engaging writing with relevant images, branded color schemes and other eye-catching elements.\n\nBillboard Marketing\n\nBillboard marketing is another way to expose more consumers to a brand and features content on larger physical surfaces. Consumers can find these kinds of advertisements in crowded areas like Times Square, along popular highways or on the walls of buildings. Some companies may pay for mobile billboards, placing ads on the sides of trucks or public transportation vehicles. All billboards follow the same principles of print marketing, combining written content with coordinated color schemes, images and other visuals. Marketing teams need to get creative with billboards, such as applying bold colors or humorous content, since drivers and passersby may only have a few moments to take in a message.\n\nEvent Marketing\n\nEvent marketing relies on both company-sponsored and public events where a business can have conversations with customers and spread its brand through physical materials. Examples of company-sponsored events include hosting a conference or learning convention. Organizations may also join public events, such as setting up a booth at a local community arts fest. Companies should supply marketing teams with materials like tents, banners and flyers for interested individuals. If possible, it’s also helpful to have a sample of a product for consumers to view. Each event provides an opportunity for marketers to share information with consumers and answer any questions, spreading their company’s brand and earning new customers.\n\nProduct Marketing\n\nProduct marketing is vital to the success of a new product launch and is applicable across many industries. Even before the product is built, these marketers are doing intense market research to ensure that the product is the right fit for a company’s customers and that it serves a useful purpose. Then, the product team will use the product marketer’s insights as a guide on what to include in the new product. As the product is being built, the marketer will arm the sales team with the necessary knowledge and materials that will help them sell the product to current customers and reach out to new audiences. After a launch, the product marketer will ensure that customers aren’t having adoption issues and will craft marketing materials to make sure that the product stays relevant as time goes on.\n\nHow to Get Into Marketing\n\nMarketing is a unique field, filled with people who are analytical, yet have an in-depth understanding of human psychology and storytelling. Companies all over the world need competent marketers as more and more products are developed. Who best to evangelize a product other than the people who have the most knowledge about the industry? If you think that mixing analytics with storytelling sounds intriguing, then a career path in marketing might be for you.\n\nThis is the perfect time to get into a marketing role. It’s expected that the advertising and marketing industry will eclipse $786 billion by 2026. Digital marketing has taken on a larger role, with click-and-display ads becoming popular tools for marketers.\n\nMarketing Education Requirements\n\nMost marketing jobs require at least a bachelor’s degree in marketing, journalism, graphic design or a similar major. This shows hiring managers that you have a firm marketing background right away. Of course, having a degree isn’t the only way to break into the industry. There are plenty of reputable courses and bootcamps that can help you become a quality job candidate (or to learn more if you’re already in the industry).\n\nMarketing Career Path\n\nThere are a few career paths that can be taken. In a more traditional marketing sense, newcomers normally start out as marketing coordinators and then work their way up to marketing manager, marketing director and then CMO.\n\nDigital marketers have more options when it comes to roles and paths to take. These marketers usually start out as coordinators and can then experience roles like marketing specialist, search engine marketing manager, social media manager, or marketing director on their way to a CMO or VP of Marketing role. New job titles and responsibilities have been constantly popping up over the last few years due to the advent of new, groundbreaking technologies in the marketing field.\n\nMarketing Career Paths\n\nThere are many important roles that make up a marketing team because of the sector’s importance to the overall goals of a company.

      "# [What Is Consumer Technology? A Guide](https://builtin.com/consumer-tech)\nA Brief History of Consumer Tech\n\nConsumer technology is the umbrella term for any type of technology created with the general public’s use in mind. Think TVs, toaster ovens, smartphones and fitness apps.\n\nConsumer tech can be traced back to the 19th century, when early tech pioneers like David Edward Hughes, Heinrich Rudolph Hertz, Nikola Tesla and Jagadish Edward Bose manipulated electricity for widespread use throughout the world. Indeed, much of the consumer tech we still interact with daily was invented during this period of innovation set between the end of the 19th century and the mid-20th century, including computers (first developed between 1940-45), transistor radios (introduced in 1954) and the microwave oven (1946).\n\nTechnology has continued to develop over time, improving and creating products that are thousands of times more capable than predecessors while enabling form factors to shrink and prices to decrease — creating a technological revolution with the power to reshape our world. Computers, for instance, were once an exclusive product and would require an entire room to store just a few megabytes. Today, powerful computers exist in the pockets of 85 percent of Americans in the form of smartphones, capable of housing hundreds of gigabytes of data with unlimited amounts of cloud space available at all times.\n\nIn another few decades, the advances in consumer tech might be unfathomable to us today.\n\nConsumer Tech Companies\n\nAlphabet (Google)\n\nApple\n\nIntel\n\nSamsung\n\nSony\n\nTesla\n\nWhirlpool\n\nYamaha\n\nConsumer Tech Vs. High Tech\n\nWhile consumer tech typically refers to general-audience-oriented technology like lightbulbs, calculators, cell phones or televisions, high-tech products are slightly different. High tech, or advanced technology, can be thought of as the most cutting-edge forms of technology available, and sometimes refers to the newest type of technology on the market.\n\nOne example of high technology is autonomous mobile robotsthat help package goods. High-tech products such as autonomous vehicles can be used by the general public but are less common than consumer technology products like a microwave or bluetooth sound system.\n\nRead NextBye, Middleman: These Are the Trends Shaping E-Commerce Right Now\n\nTechnology has evolved to better meet and fulfill the needs of people, and as a result, people are now constantly interacting with consumer technology products. Several categories and subcategories of customer technology exist, with plenty of overlap.\n\nTypes of Consumer Technology\n\nAppliances\n\nSmart devices\n\nFitness wearables\n\nSelf-driving cars\n\nVideo game consoles and devices\n\nDrones\n\nComputer software\n\nAs more products are introduced at conferences like the Consumer Electronics Show, these categories will inevitably expand. There are hundreds of categories that could be listed here and products will continue to hit the market as technology evolves. Some of today’s most notable consumer tech categories include:\n\n5G Devices\n\nDevices connected to 5G networks — or 4G, LTE or any other form of cellular network — are able to receive network signals from cellular towers and provide users with online connectivity. Many of the most common forms of consumer electronics fall into this category, including smartphones, tablets and portable hotspots.\n\nIoT Devices\n\nInternet of Things, or IoT, devices connect to specific applications via the internet or other forms of wireless networks for unparalleled user visibility and control. Some common consumer tech products in the IoT devices category included smart home appliances, such as app-controlled thermostats, locks and lights, sensor-based products like doorbells with cameras set to alert users to movement, and various Bluetooth devices.\n\nComputers\n\nIn recent years, computers’ capabilities have increased while their costs have decreased. And everyday people use them for all sorts of reasons — work, gaming, video streaming, internet browsing and more. Laptops, desktops, tablets, gaming computers, video game consoles, smartphones, hard drives and several other types of devices fall into this consumer tech category.\n\nSelf-Driving and Electric Vehicle Consumer Tech\n\nSince their emergence in the early 20th century, cars and motor vehicles of all kinds have grown to become one of the most critical forms of consumer tech to most societies around the world. As technology has improved, so have cars, with vehicles now commonly possessing high-tech features such as built-in GPS, self-driving capabilities, automatic braking, lane sensors, rearview cameras, power steering, and a bevy of additional online and offline capabilities that enhance both safety and comfort. Electric vehicles have eliminated the need for wasteful natural gas resources and self-driving cars are on the rise.\n\nTelevisions and Smart Screens\n\nTelevision became a cultural phenomenon in the mid-20th century and its status has since become cemented as a focal point of modern society. The average American adult watches three hours of television per day, as of 2022. TV and smart screens have been bolstered by the many advancements that the near-century old medium has undergone. Today’s top-end “smart TVs” come loaded with WiFi/5G capabilities, built-in applications, internet search capabilities, built-in gaming features, computer monitoring and more.\n\nSmart Speakers\n\nLeading consumer tech companies like Amazon and Google have introduced a variety of home speakers with built-in virtual assistant technology. These speakers possess internet connectivity and can play music, look up information, place orders and complete a variety of additional tasks by linking to existing accounts. Three of the most popular smart speakers are the Amazon Echo, Apple HomePod and Google Home.\n\nAppliances\n\nHome appliances are a form of consumer tech products that allow people to live easier, more fulfilling lives. From microwave ovens and various kitchen appliances to laundry machines, space heaters and more, appliances of some kind can be found in a majority of homes worldwide.\n\nFitness and Wearables\n\nFitness and consumer tech have merged in seamless fashion, with people embracing devices that track their daily fitness goals and keep them engaged in their activities and workouts. Wearables expand beyond fitness, however, with devices and technology hitting the market that filter air, keep users temperate, alert the proper parties when in danger or in need of help, and much more. Wearable consumer tech includes smartwatches, fitness trackers, heart rate monitors, 911-alerting devices and tech-enabled clothing.\n\nGaming\n\nThe video gaming industry has exploded since its rise through the late 1970s and the 1980s. Today’s systems possess the processing capabilities that would have been unfathomable to game designers back in those days, such as 5K graphics, online gameplay and lightning-fast processor speeds. Video gaming consoles, games, software, VR devices, gaming computers, handheld consoles, add-ons, and accessories are all included in this category.\n\nDrones and Robotics\n\nDrones have been in military use since the 20th century, with commercial and consumer drones hitting the market in the early 21st century. Consumer drones have the ability to take photos, record videos and deliver packages at previously unreachable heights and distances, produced in a variety of form factors and with many accessories for customizing personal drone experiences.\n\nAudio and Music Consumer Tech\n\nSome consumers, whether audiophiles or musicians, take sound very seriously. This category is meant to address that, creating technologically advanced solutions that help them dial in the perfect sound response to their ears, in real time. Multi-room sound systems, Bluetooth speakers, amplifiers, interfaces, microphones, instruments and software all fall into this category of consumer tech.\n\nPhotography\n\nThe first cameras emerged in the late 19th century, since then, photography equipment has embraced digital and technological advancements to unlock capabilities like faster shutter speeds, faster lens speeds, 5K video capturing, low-light shooting and much more. Photography consumer tech includes camera bodies, lenses, sensors, hard drives, memory cards, flash units and additional accessories.\n\nDelivery Consumer Tech\n\nDelivery apps and food delivery platforms have become an integral part of people’s lives. Delivery services use several facets of technology to bring products right to our doors. This industry could not exist without the right software, mobile technology and vehicles.\n\nSoftware\n\nMuch of the consumer tech that people interact with is not a physical product but software that writes the rules to allow hardware to function. Software is responsible for enabling nearly all forms of consumer tech products to work and interact, from menu screens to full-on computer programs.\n\nRelated ReadingProptech: Everything You Need to Know (With 25 Examples)",
      "# [What Is Cryptanalysis? (Definition, Types, Goals) by Anthony Corbo on 2023-01-03](https://builtin.com/articles/cryptanalysis)\nCryptanalysis is the study and discovery of vulnerabilities within cryptographic algorithms that can be used to decrypt ciphertext without knowledge of the secret key. Several forms of cryptanalysis can be used to attack cryptographic messages, ranging from the interception of messages within unsecured communication channels to the matching of plaintext based on the same algorithm techniques. Cryptanalysis also includes measures taken to stop attackers from decoding cryptographic algorithms.\n\nMore From Built In ExpertsHow to Break Into Cybersecurity\n\nTypes of Cryptanalysis\n\nThere are three generic forms of cryptanalysis: ciphertext-only, known ciphertext/plaintext pairs and chosen plaintext or chosen ciphertext.\n\nIn ciphertext-only cryptanalysis, the attacker has the ciphertext available to them for decoding. In known ciphertext/plaintext pair cryptanalysis, attackers will know some element of the plaintext and will be able to match likely elements of the ciphertext to the known plaintext. For example, a computer session may begin with “LOG IN.”\n\nDeciphering this string of text will also allow the attacker to decrypt plaintext that matches the deciphered ciphertext throughout the message. Chosen plaintext or chosen ciphertext cryptanalysis occurs when the attacker unwittingly causes either the transmitter to encrypt plaintext or the receiver to decrypt ciphertext. This provides the attacker with an abundance of knowledge, possibly even knowledge of the entire message’s contents.\n\nWhat Is the Primary Goal of Cryptanalysis?\n\nCryptanalysis is used to understand the contents of protected or encrypted messages and data in order to gain access to either in-transit or at-rest data. Attackers using cryptanalysis may have several goals for doing so, but the ultimate goal is always some degree of cryptographic decryption through either the ciphertext or plain text.\n\nSome specific goals associated with cryptanalysis include a total break (the locating of the secret key), global deduction (the locating of a functionally equivalent algorithm for encryption and decryption without knowledge of the secret key), information deduction (the acquiring of a portion of information about the plaintext or ciphertext that was not previously known), and the distinguishing of the algorithm (giving the attacker the ability to determine the encryption’s output from a random selection of plaintext).\n\nMore From the Built In Tech DictionaryWhat Is a DDoS Attack?\n\nWhat Does a Cryptanalyst Do?\n\nCryptanalysts can be hired to find security weaknesses, potential data leak causes, discover evidence from encrypted messages and more.\n\nCryptanalysts are often associated with government agencies or law enforcement, hired to ensure agency encryption methods are up to par with the current standards in cybersecurity and engage in the deciphering of encrypted messages. Cryptanalysts do this by purposefully exploiting weaknesses so fixes can be applied. As mentioned, government organizations often employ cryptanalysts to decipher encrypted communications and law enforcement agencies will hire cryptanalysts to decode encrypted messages within evidence or testify as experts on a case.\n\nRegardless of their industry or ethics, cryptanalysts must have a strong understanding of mathematics, ciphers, codes, and encryption systems, with daily responsibilities including analyzing intelligence information, diagnosing weaknesses within cryptographic algorithms, developing new cryptanalysis tools and more.",

      "# [Cyberloafing: What Is It and How To Prevent It by Dawn Kawamoto on 2022-11-28](https://builtin.com/articles/cyberloafing)\nCyberloafing in the workplace is a bad thing, right?\n\nAfter all, this habit of employees engaging in non-work-related internet surfing costs U.S. employers a whopping $85 billion a year, according to a University of Nevada report cited by the BBC.\n\nAnd 36 percent of millennials and Gen Z said they spend two or more hours per workday looking at their phones for personal activities, according to over 1,000 full-time U.S. workers surveyed in the 2018 Workplace Distraction Report by online learning company Udemy.\n\nWhat Is Cyberloafing?\n\nCyberloafing is when employees use their work time to engage in non-work-related internet activities from checking social media and personal email to web browsing and more.\n\nAnd with more people working from home following the pandemic, cyberloafing is only increasing.\n\nThe initial reaction often is to stomp out cyberloafing because of its adverse impact on productivity, but research is emerging that raises questions about its potential benefits (like addressing burnout), too.\n\nMore on Work CultureWhat Does Hybrid Work Culture Look Like?\n\nFree Guide: What Does it Take to Retain a Remote Workforce?\n\nHow to reduce turnover while increasing engagement and inclusion for remote employees.\n\nWhat Is Cyberloafing?\n\nCyberloafing is a term to describe employees who use work time to engage in non-work-related activities on the internet, such as web browsing, using social media, or checking and responding to personal email.\n\nAnd while its definition is relatively simple to describe, the way it can manifest makes it a complex matter. Some workers may turn to cyberloafing to relieve stress on the job and browse the internet as a coping mechanism, according to a study titled “Unraveling Cyberloafing Paradox: Towards a Targeted Approach for Managing Cyberloafing.”\n\nEmployees spending time browsing the internet on their phone, or emailing friends and looking at social media when they are supposed to be working on a report is a blatant example of cyberloafing, Bright Frimpong, a research assistant at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley and co-author of the “Unraveling Cyberloafing Paradox” study, told Built In.\n\nBut there are also a lot of gray areas when it comes to cyberloafing, Frimpong added. For example, he said, if there is a lull in your work while you wait for another team to finish a project to hand over to you, are you really cyberloafing if you use the time to check your personal email, look up sports scores or watch a YouTube video?\n\n“It’s very difficult to pinpoint these as cyberloafing behaviors because even though they are not productive, the employee has really nothing to do at that time,” Frimpong added. “I think it’s just a matter of being productive at the right time.”\n\nThe term was coined in 1995 but grew in popularity in 2002 after a research paper was published in the Organizational Behavior Journal on the topic. Initially, early research focused on the unproductive and harmful effects a company faced when its employees engaged in cyberloafing. But as study into this area matured, researchers began exploring other fringe areas of cyberloafing and the discovery of potential benefits began to emerge, Frimpong said.\n\nFind out who's hiring.\n\nSee all HR jobs at top tech companies & startups\n\nView Jobs\n\nWhat Causes Cyberloafing?\n\nTo understand the causes of cyberloafing, you need to understand what employees are trying to achieve by it. In some instances, there are tangible benefits like learning new skills. In others, the employee might use it for a much-needed break for their mental health or well-being.\n\nFor example, loneliness and workplace ostracism can prompt some employees to turn to social media to offset the lack of interaction with co-workers and others, said Natalie Mason, a PhD candidate at Aston University who is researching the use of cyberloafing as a coping mechanism and authored a report on the topic published in Nature Reviews Psychology.\n\nThese employees may find the emotional support they need to power through the rest of the day via social media, Mason said.\n\nWhat Causes Cyberloafing?\n\nLoneliness and workplace ostracism\n\nStress\n\nBurnout\n\nWorkplace aggression\n\nEmotional or physical pain\n\nBoredom\n\nDesire to find resources that make work and life better\n\nIn other cases, employees are using cyberloafing as a release valve for their stress, whether it’s from feeling burned out or because of workplace aggression from others, Mason said. It can provide a mental distraction that can help employees jump back into work once their cyberloafing break is over.\n\nCyberloafing can also help momentarily offset workplace boredom, allowing employees to take a mental break from their tasks and return refreshed.\n\nEmployees who lack adequate resources at work, such as an ergonomic office chair, may jump on the internet to learn of alternative resources they could use, like browsing for one. That internet activity, however, is considered a form of cyberloafing since it is not directly involved with the task at hand and is considered developing new non-work-related skills or abilities while on the job, Frimpong said.\n\nEmployer policies around allowing workers to bring their own electronic devices, such as smartphones, tablets or even laptops, into the workplace can also contribute to cyberloafing, since employees may feel it’s perfectly fine to use them anytime, despite being on the clock.\n\nMore on Mental HealthHow to Avoid Employee Burnout\n\nHow to Prevent Cyberloafing\n\nTo start, develop clear and equitable cyberloafing HR policies. Set expectations on the amount of time or circumstances where non-work-related internet activities would be allowed either on an employee’s personal device or the company’s equipment. Be sure to clearly note the websites and social media that would be prohibited.\n\nAnd rather than just address an employee’s actual cyberloafing behavior, try digging deeper into the “why” with them.\n\n“Managers need to be more understanding of why someone might go to their phone or use the internet during a time they should be productive at work.”\n\n“There are so many motivations that go into cyberloafing. So, to really understand how to stop it or manage it, you need to know the motivations behind it,” Frimpong said.\n\nIn some cases, for example, employees may lack the self-awareness to know they are using social media at work because they feel ostracized by their teammates, but in other cases, they might be aware of this reason. In either situation, the issue should be discussed with the employee’s manager, Mason said.\n\nWays to Prevent Cyberloafing\n\nSet expectations on when non-work-related internet activities are allowed, and on which devices.\n\nClearly note websites and social media that are prohibited.\n\nIdentify triggers for employees who might be engaging in non-work-related internet activities to reduce emotional or physical issues.\n\nHave open conversations with employees to understand why they may be resorting to cyberloafing.\n\n“Managers need to be more understanding of why someone might go to their phone or use the internet during a time they should be productive at work,” Mason told Built In. “There should be open communication between you and your employees to understand why they are doing these actions.”\n\nFor employees who turn to cyberloafing to improve their well-being or to reduce emotional or physical discomfort, it comes down to identifying the triggers for those behaviors and then addressing them through conversations with the employee in question.\n\nIn cases where cyberloafing is excessive and interfering with meeting deadlines or completing projects, it can be useful to explore the problem through another lens.\n\n“You have to look at cyberloafing as the same way you would diagnose mental illness,” Mason said. “If it gets in the way of your everyday life, then it’s excessive. If it’s stopping you from meeting your deadlines and doing your everyday job, it’s excessive.”",

      "# [What Is an FET (Field-Effect Transistor)? by Artem Oppermann on 2023-04-10](https://builtin.com/hardware/fet)\nA field-effect transistor (FET) is a type of transistor that uses an electric field to control the current flow through a semiconductor channel. FETs are widely used in electronic circuits due to their high input impedance, low output impedance and high gain.\n\nMore From This ExpertWhat Is an Electrical Charge?\n\nCharacteristics of an FET\n\nVoltage-Controlled Device\n\nAn FET is a voltage-controlled device. This means that its output current is controlled by the voltage we apply to its gate terminal.\n\nHigh-Input Impedance\n\nFETs have very high input impedance, which means they do not load down the signal source and can be used as buffer amplifiers. Using FETs as buffer amplifiers can help prevent signal distortion and improve the overall quality of the circuit’s output. Additionally, FETs are power-efficient, which makes them an attractive choice for battery-powered devices.\n\nUnipolar Device\n\nFETs are unipolar devices, which means they use only one type of charge carrier (electrons or holes) to control the current flow. The alternative to a unipolar device is a bipolar device. Unlike a unipolar device like an FET, a bipolar device such as a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) uses both electrons and holes to control the current flow. Bipolar devices have a high current gain and can handle higher power levels, which makes them suitable for power amplification applications.\n\n3 Terminals\n\nThe source, the drain and the gate are an FET’s three terminals. The source and drain are connected to the channel, while the gate controls the flow of current through the channel.\n\nRelated ReadingNMOS Transistors and PMOS Transistors Explained\n\nChannel Conductivity\n\nWe can control the conductivity of the channel in an FET by the voltage we apply to the gate. In an n-channel FET, a positive voltage applied to the gate will attract electrons to the channel and increase its conductivity. In a p-channel FET, a negative voltage applied to the gate will attract holes to the channel and increase its conductivity.\n\nTypes of FETs\n\nJunction Field-Effect Transistor (JFET)\n\nIn a JFET, the channel consists of a semiconductor material and the channel has two regions at each end. These are known as the source and the drain terminals. The gate is a PN junction that’s formed perpendicular to the channel. The gate terminal is biased in reverse. This creates a depletion region that controls the width of the channel. When we apply a voltage to the gate, the depletion region widens, thereby reducing the channel width and the current flowing through it.\n\nMetal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET)\n\nSimilar to JFETs, in MOSFETs the channel is also formed by a semiconductor material and it has two regions at either end, known as the source and drain terminals. In a MOSFET however, the gate is separated from the channel by a thin insulating layer that typically consists of silicon dioxide. As soon as a voltage is applied to the gate, it creates an electric field that attracts or repels charge carriers in the channel, depending on the voltage’s polarity. This process controls the width of the channel and the flow of current between the source and drain terminals.\n\nMOSFETs can be further classified into two subtypes: enhancement-mode and depletion-mode MOSFETs.\n\nEnhancement-Mode MOSFETs\n\nIn enhancement-mode MOSFETs, the channel is normally off and you must apply a positive voltage to the gate in order to turn it on.\n\nDepletion-Mode MOSFETs\n\nIn depletion-mode MOSFETs, the channel is normally on and you must apply a negative voltage to the gate to turn it off.\n\nAdvantages of Using an FET\n\nFETs have several advantages over other types of transistors, which make them popular in a variety of electronic applications.\n\nHigh-input impedance: FETs have very high input impedance, which means we can use them to buffer and amplify signals without loading down the signal source. As a result, FETs are ideal for use in preamplifiers, mixers and other signal processing circuits.\n\nLow noise: FETs have low noise levels, which means we can use them in low-noise amplifiers and other applications where noise is a concern.\n\nLow power consumption: FETs require very little power to operate so they’re ideal for battery-powered devices and other low-power applications.\n\nFast switching speed: FETs have very fast switching speeds, which make them ideal for use in digital circuits, switching power supplies and other high-frequency applications.\n\nTemperature stability: FETs have excellent temperature stability, which means their performance remains consistent over a wide range of temperatures.\n\nHigh voltage handling capability: FETs can handle high voltage, which makes them suitable for use in high-voltage circuits such as power amplifiers and power supplies.\n\nMore From the Built In Tech DictionaryWhat Is an EMP?\n\nDisadvantages of Using an FET\n\nDespite their advantages, FETs nevertheless have some disadvantages we should consider when designing electronic circuits.",
      "# [What Is a Firewall? (Definition, Types, Examples) by Mitchell Telatnik on 2023-03-28](https://builtin.com/articles/firewall)\nA firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic from a computer network. By allowing only authorized traffic and blocking unwanted traffic, firewalls protect against unauthorized access, malware and other security threats. Firewalls can also prevent sensitive data from leaving the network.\n\nHow Does a Firewall Work?\n\nA firewall inspects incoming and outgoing network traffic, and makes decisions based on the ruleset. The data sent over a computer network is assembled into a packet, which contains the sender and recipient’s IP addresses and port numbers. Before a packet is delivered to its destination, it’s sent to the firewall for inspection. If the firewall determines the packet is permitted, it will send it to the destination; otherwise, the firewall will drop the packet.\n\nThe criteria the firewall uses to determine whether or not the packet is permitted is called a ruleset. For example, a firewall rule may say to drop all traffic incoming to port 22, which is commonly used to log in to computers remotely using SSH (secure shell). In this case, when a packet arrives with the destination port of 22, the firewall will ignore it and fail to deliver it to the source IP.\n\nMore From Built In’s Tech DictionaryWhat Is SSO?\n\nAdvantages of a Firewall\n\nFirewalls create a layer of protection against unauthorized access to your network.\n\nFirewalls help organizations manage their bandwidth usage.\n\nFirewalls help you monitor your network traffic so you can identify and respond to threats quickly.\n\nFirewalls prevent viruses and malware from infecting systems and spreading throughout the network.\n\nNetwork Security\n\nFirewalls are essential tools for keeping networks secure and there are many advantages to using them in your network design. One of the most important advantages is that firewalls create a layer of protection against unauthorized access to your network. By blocking traffic from untrusted sources, firewalls act as a gatekeeper and prevent external threats like unauthorized access attempts, malware and viruses. In short, a firewall helps keep an organization’s data safe and prevent security breaches that can cause significant damage.\n\nOrganizational Control\n\nFirewalls also give an organization control over their network traffic. This means it’s easier for organizations to manage their bandwidth use and prioritize what applications they use regularly. For example, you can set rules to ensure that business-critical applications get the resources they need while limiting the amount of bandwidth used by non-essential applications like social media or video streaming. Additionally, firewalls provide real-time visibility into your network traffic, thereby allowing you to detect and respond to potential security threats quickly.\n\nProtection Against Malware and Viruses\n\nAnother critical advantage of using a firewall is that it provides protection against malware and viruses. By blocking traffic from known malicious sources, firewalls prevent viruses and malware from infecting systems and spreading throughout the network. With cyber threats becoming more sophisticated, firewalls are an essential defense against these risks. Some firewalls can even scan for malware and viruses on outgoing traffic, which provides even more protection against cyber attacks.\n\nTypes of Firewalls\n\nThere are three major categories of firewalls: network firewalls, host-based firewalls and web application firewalls.\n\n1. Network Firewalls\n\nA network firewall is the most common type of firewall. It inspects and manages both incoming and outgoing communications from the network. For example, a company may place a network firewall to block incoming and outgoing communications from the internet. Organizations may also place network firewalls within their network between what are called network segments. These types of firewalls allow the organization to control communications between different groups of devices. There are different types of network firewalls.\n\nStatic Network Firewalls\n\nStatic network firewalls, also known as packet-inspection firewalls, filter only on the individual packet information using the source and destination IP address, protocol and ports.\n\nStateful Firewalls\n\nStateful firewalls keep track of network sessions, which helps the firewall understand the context of a single packet in relation to others and make better decisions about what to allow or deny.\n\nNext-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)\n\nNext-generation firewalls combine multiple features such as application-level filtering, integrated intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) and content filtering. This combination of features makes NGFWs the most common type of firewall today.\n\nFind out who's hiring.\n\nSee jobs at top tech companies & startups\n\nView All Jobs\n\n2. Host-Based Firewalls\n\nHost-based firewalls monitor and control the inbound and outbound network traffic of an individual device on which they are installed. Unlike network firewalls, which control the flow of traffic across an entire network, host-based firewalls work on a per-device basis. We can install them as third-party software but they’re also sometimes included in the base operating system such as Windows or MacOS.\n\nBy controlling the traffic on a per-device basis, host-based firewalls can provide more granular control over the communication of an individual device. This control can be useful in situations where a device needs to communicate with specific servers or services, but not others. For example, we can configure a host-based firewall to allow communication with a particular web server, but block communication with other servers.\n\nIn addition, our devices may be vulnerable to security threats when connected to unknown networks, such as a local coffee shop’s public network. Host-based firewalls are useful for devices we often connect to different networks.\n\nMore From Built In Cybersecurity ExpertsMutual TLS: A Tutorial\n\n3. Web Application Firewalls (WAF)\n\nWeb application firewalls are specialized firewalls designed to control network access to web applications, such as websites. Web application firewalls are placed in front of a web application, which means that if you’re interacting with a website, you’ll be sending packets to the WAF instead of the web server itself. The WAF will then determine if your connection is permitted or denied. Web application firewalls operate at layer seven of the OSI model and filter HTTP connections in order to protect against threats such as injection attacks, request forgery, cross-site scripting, broken access control and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.\n\nFirewall Applications\n\nFirewalls provide the foundation for network security and can have multiple applications for protecting an organization’s resources. Here are some common scenarios.\n\nPreventing unauthorized access to resources\n\nPreventing command and control traffic\n\nContent filtering\n\nNetwork data loss protection\n\nIdentifying network intrusion attempts\n\n1. Preventing Unauthorized Access to Resources\n\nOne of the core applications of a firewall is to control access to resources on a network and prevent unauthorized access to those resources.\n\nFor example, let’s say we deployed a file share server that allows employees to store and access files centrally instead of keeping local copies on their devices. Anyone who is not an employee, however, should not be able to access this file share. To help enforce this, we can create a firewall rule that states any incoming networking communication to the file share server that did not originate from the corporate network should be denied.\n\n2. Preventing Command and Control Traffic\n\nWhen attackers gain unauthorized access to a network, they will sometimes install malware that enables them to remotely send the computer commands. Large groups of these infected computers are often referred to as “botnets.” Using threat intelligence such as the IP addresses of known command and control infrastructure, the network traffic can be denied by the firewall before it ever establishes a connection.\n\nRelated ReadingHow to Protect Your System From Botnet Malware\n\n3. Filtering Content\n\nYou may know content filtering as the annoying blocks when you visit sites such as Facebook. While blocking sites that do not have a business purpose is a capability of most modern firewalls, the most common reason we implement content filtering is to prevent employees from accessing known malicious websites.\n\nFor example, if we know that a website is compromised and could pose a risk of malware, content filtering allows us to check if the user is attempting to access that site. If so, the traffic can be denied and the user redirected to a notice message instead.\n\n4. Preventing Network Data Loss\n\nSimilar to inspecting network traffic for known malicious websites, we can inspect network traffic for sensitive data such as credit card information, personally identifiable information or trade secrets. If this data is detected in the traffic, we can choose to allow or deny it based on various parameters, such as the destination site.\n\nLet’s say, for example, that a user is attempting to upload credit card information to Dropbox. Before their network traffic leaves the network, it is routed through a firewall that has a rule to drop all traffic with credit card information unless the website is one of the few approved by the information security team, which prevents the employee from uploading the data.\n\n5.

      "# [Nanorobotics: Theory, Applications, How Does It Work? by Artem Oppermann on 2023-03-03](https://builtin.com/robotics/nanorobotics)\nNanorobotics refers to the emerging field of science and technology that deals with the design, development and control of robots at the nanoscale.\n\nThe nanoscale includes the size range of 1 to 100 nanometers, where one nanometer (nm) is equal to one billionth of a meter.\n\nSince nanorobots are robots built to operate at the nanoscale, they could perform tasks that are beyond the capabilities of conventional macro-scale robots. Nanorobots would have unique properties and capabilities that allow them to control and manipulate materials at the nanoscale, which would make them highly valuable for a wide range of applications and industries.\n\nUsing nanorobots can also lead to cost savings and improved efficiency. For example, in healthcare, nanorobots could be used for targeted drug delivery, which can reduce the amount of medication a patient needs and minimize side effects, thereby resulting in cost savings for patients and healthcare providers. Nanorobots could also be used for non-invasive surgeries to reduce the need for lengthy hospital stays and recovery times. It’s clear the field of nanorobotics has the potential to bring significant, positive changes and benefit society in numerous ways.\n\nRelated Reading From This ExpertWhat Is Nanotechnology?\n\nHow Do Nanorobotics Work?\n\nNanorobotics work by using robots at nanoscale, which are also known as nanorobots. The design and operation of nanorobots can vary depending on their intended use. In general, nanorobots would work by using various technologies like nanoscale sensors, control systems and nanoscale actuators.\n\nThe sensors in nanorobots could detect specific signals or conditions like the presence of a certain type of molecule or material, and then transmit this information to the control system. The control system could then use this information to decide on the proper action for the nanorobot. We could use the nanorobots’ actuators to perform a wide range of actions including movement, releasing of drugs in the human body or the manipulation of structures and materials (more on this below).\n\nIn order to perform their intended tasks, nanorobots need to be able to navigate and interact with their environment. This can be accomplished by a variety of methods like self-propulsion, remote control, or through chemical or biological means.\n\nWhat Are the Challenges of Nanorobotics?\n\nThe development and implementation of nanorobotics faces several challenges, including:\n\nTechnical Complexity: Designing and operating nanorobots is a complicated process that involves many technical difficulties like development of nanoscale components, controlling the movement of the nanorobots and ensuring their stability.\n\nSafety Concerns: The potential for nanorobots in medical applications and the environment raises concerns about their safety. For example, nanorobots, designed for medical treatments, could harm patients in the case of a malfunction.\n\nRegulatory Issues: There are currently few regulations in place to govern the development and use of nanorobots, which may slow their widespread adoption by public and private sector entities.\n\nFunding and Resources: The development of nanorobotics is quite expensive and requires significant funding and resources, as well as specialized equipment and human expertise.\n\nScalability: The development and production of large numbers of nanorobots can be challenging due to the complex and time-consuming nature of the manufacturing process.\n\nFind out who's hiring.\n\nSee all Developer + Engineer jobs at top tech companies & startups\n\nView 10000+ Jobs\n\nAre Nanorobotics Dangerous?\n\nIf not properly designed and controlled, nanobots could cause harm to a living organism or the environment. Let’s say, hypothetically, that nanobots are designed and programmed to target and remove a specific type of cellular debris in a human body. Instead, the nanobots could end up attacking healthy cells or tissues, which will cause harm to the patient. This situation could occur if the nanobots cannot properly distinguish between the targeted debris and healthy cells, or in the case of the nanobots malfunction. Another risk would involve the potential for the harmful use of nanorobots. For example, nanorobots could be used as weapons or for industrial espionage.\n\nDue to these mentioned challenges, the development of nanorobotics has been slow so far and commercial use seems far away. However, we’ve seen progress and it’s likely that these challenges will be overcome in the coming decades.\n\nMore in Nanotechnology10 Nanotechnology Examples Making a Big Impact\n\nApplications of Nanorobotics\n\nThe field of nanorobotics has a wide range of potential applications across various industries. It’s important to note that many of these applications are still theoretical.",

      "# [Microrobotics: Tiny Robots and Their Many Uses by Jacob Biba on 2022-09-07](https://builtin.com/robotics/microrobotics)\nThis journey began in the stomach of a mouse.\n\nMore than seven years ago, a team of researchers led by Joseph Wang, a professor of nanoengineering at the University of California San Diego, deployed a small, zinc-based robotic motor inside a mouse’s stomach. The motor — which measured less than the width of a human hair and was propelled by the mouse’s own gastric acid — delivered a payload of gold nanoparticles before self-destructing.\n\nIt’s believed to be the first in vivo use of a micromotor inside a living creature, Wang told Built In, drawing comparisons to Fantastic Voyage, a science-fiction film released more than half a century ago. In the film, a nuclear submarine and its human crew are shrunk down and sent on a life-saving mission — inside a human.\n\nFollowing the success of Wang’s experiment, more gastric acid-fueled and treatment-focused voyages inside mice and larger animals, like pigs, have commenced, paving the way for potential human trials. It’s possible, in the future, a wave of targeted treatment and therapeutic applications for the biotech industry will be developed, all likely starting with a simple swallow of an encapsulated microrobot.\n\n“You’ll take your pill,” Wang said. “But the robot will do the job.”\n\nMore on RoboticsXenobots: The Self-Replicating Living Robots\n\nWhat Is Microrobotics?\n\nMicrorobotics is basically an all-encompassing term covering the development of small robots. Microrobots typically measure less than 1 millimeter, though sizing can vary based on researcher and use case.\n\nToday, microrobots are mainly used in the biotech industry, aiding in the development of diagnostic and targeted therapeutic tools to monitor and treat disease. They’ve also been developed to aid in environmental monitoring and remediation, search and rescue, engine inspection, and for agricultural research.\n\nResearchers are currently exploring how these tiny robots could potentially respond to chemicals or other biological signals they may encounter in the human body, as well as work together and communicate with one another in swarms during environmental remediation applications.\n\nMore on Medical Robotics11 Medical and Surgical Robots Transforming the Healthcare Industry\n\nMicrorobotics in Biotech\n\nAdvances in robotics are typically spurred by the innate desire to eliminate those mundane chores, like vacuuming, we no longer want to do. But with microrobotics, it’s different. The jobs these robots are designed for could save our lives.\n\n“If you look at the main motivation of tiny robots, even from the beginning, it’s always been medical,” Metin Sitti, director of the Physical Intelligence Department at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart, Germany, told Built In. It’s where the greatest scientific and societal impact can be made, he said, the dream being that one day robots would be miniaturized and put inside the human body to monitor and treat disease.\n\n“If you look at the main motivation of tiny robots, even from the beginning, it’s always been medical.”\n\nSitti’s first project inspired by this dream was a soft robotic capsule targeting the GI tract. To create it, Sitti and his team turned existing capsule camera technology being used commercially in healthcare into a small robot that could potentially deliver drugs and perform biopsies and other treatments.\n\n“We started with pill-size robots that could be put inside the body,” Sitti said. “And then we miniaturized [them] down to microscale.”\n\nOver the last 10 years, Sitti and his team in Germany have developed untethered microrobots measuring as large as the diameter of a catheter down to cell size for applications targeting certain diseases where limited access poses a high risk, like pancreatic and brain cancers, cardiac diseases, blood clots, strokes and aneurysms.\n\n“We are trying to identify such critical diseases where wireless microrobots can make a big difference,” Sitti said.\n\nMore on RoboticsWhat Are Shape-Shifting Robots?\n\nMicrorobotics Outside the Human Body\n\nOf course, developments in the field are poised to have an impact outside the human body, too.\n\nSearch and Rescue Operations\n\nImagine being buried under rubble, or trapped in some other confined space after a natural disaster when suddenly, from the nookiest of crannies, a tiny, cockroach-like robot comes to your rescue. While it won’t physically pull you out from wreckage, this bio-inspired microrobot would work in concert with search and rescue teams, potentially providing communication capabilities while relaying location and other vital information that could aid in your rescue.\n\nDeveloped by researchers at Harvard University’s Wyss Institute, the Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot, known as HAMR, has more than 60 joints and can move at four body lengths per second. New developments like electroadhesive foot pads and origami-based ankle joints in HAMR-E, a more recent iteration of the microrobot, allow it to traverse more challenging surfaces that are curved or inverted, giving them the potential to work in those hard-to-reach places and navigate confines like jet engines for safety inspections.\n\nPlant Pollination\n\nNoah Jafferis, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, is also working on a bio-inspired microrobot — a robotic bee capable of shaking pollen from flowering plants with “high frequency” vibrations emanating from the device’s “artificial muscles.”\n\nThe microrobot’s vibrating muscles would enable researchers to mimic the vibration of a buzz-pollinating bee, Jafferis told Built in, and ultimately help them learn more about the buzz pollination process.\n\nJafferis and research partner Mario Vallejo-Marin, an associate professor of biological and environmental sciences at the University of Stirling in Scotland, were awarded an $840,000 grant from the Human Frontier Science Program, a French non-profit that funds collaborative life science research, to support their project over the next three years. “Potential benefits of our research, down the line, include understanding better what kind of bee vibrations are best to pollinate different types of flowers, including perhaps even crop species like tomato,” Vallejo-Marin told the Boston Globe in April.\n\nBiodefense and Environmental Remediation\n\nTiny robots also prove useful when it comes to biodefense and environmental remediation. According to Wang, special receptors can be added to microrobots which can then be released to capture, transport, isolate or destroy nerve agents, other biological weapons like Ricin and Anthrax and even viruses.\n\nIn response to the pandemic, Wang worked on a microrobotic model based on algae capable of removing the COVID-19 virus from wastewater. Like other environmental remediation tools, this bio-inspired microrobot, which is paired with an antibody of the virus’ spike protein, works as a swimming sponge to detoxify its surrounding environment.\n\nBut there’s only so much a single microrobot can do when it comes to remediation. That’s why researchers like Sitti believe swarms of microrobots, with onboard sensing capabilities, will one day be deployed to monitor sensitive environments, quickly detecting toxic and other dangerous chemicals if some sort of spill or accident were to occur.\n\n“I think rather than these passive techniques that we typically use right now with some chemicals, we’d like to change it with active microrobotic collectors or swarms doing that, which will be much smarter, effective and faster,” Sitti said. “As an autonomous system, if we can build and leave them in the environment, they can do this continuously without human intervention.”\n\nMore on Robotic Innovation35 Robotics Companies on the Forefront of Innovation\n\nThe Future of Microrobotics\n\nLike Wang and Sitti, Jinxing Li, an assistant professor in the department of bioengineering and the Institute for Qualitative Health Science and Engineering at Michigan State University, is also working to unlock the health benefits of microrobotics. Li is especially focused on the targeted therapeutic potential of microrobotics, like tiny robots that could enter the human body to detect and kill cancer cells with thermal ablation, or extreme heat.\n\nAnd for Wang, his team’s in vivo microrobotic motor experiments are an exciting step toward detecting, treating and managing diseases like diabetes. One day he envisions humans taking a daily multi-segment microrobotic pill — one with multiple targets that releases drugs sequentially all at the appropriate time.\n\nBut for this to be realized, a number of barriers will have to be overcome.\n\n“Are they powerful enough to move in your body, and if so, how am I going to see them?”\n\nIn the last 10 years, questions around how to power microrobots have been solved: They’re typically powered either with magnets, acoustic or light, or self-propelled through chemical reaction, like Wang’s micromotor. But Li told Built In it gets more complicated as you look to the future.\n\n“Are they powerful enough to move in your body, and if so, how am I going to see them?,” he said. “I think imaging and navigation are going to be the next challenges for medical applications.”\n\nThen regulators, doctors and the general public have to see, and believe, that these devices can operate safely. There’s also a psychological barrier to overcome, according to Sitti, like the belief, promoted by books and films, that these devices could prove dangerous. “In that sense, we need to educate the public on the positive uses of these tiny devices for medical and other environmental applications,” Sitti said.\n\nAnother challenge lies in commercialization, and whether companies can bring these technologies to market, which may prove difficult until investors are convinced that these tiny robots can be used to effectively treat disease. Though one startup, Bionaut Labs, is planning clinical trials within the next two years for its robots — microrobotic devices that can be injected into the human body and guided to the brain with magnets to treat brain disorders like the congenital brain malformation known as Dandy-Walker syndrome and certain brain tumors, Agence France-Presse reports.\n\nBut much of the future of microrobotics will likely rest in the ability to manufacture these devices at scale. “Manufacturing is a key for any technology improvement,” Li said.\n\nThree-dimensional printing is one promising technique, according to Sitti, though he cautions that while it could prove effective for medical applications where costs can be high, lower-cost options — like roll-to-roll systems and molding-based approaches — are needed to scale manufacturing for uses outside biomedical, in areas like environmental monitoring.\n\nManufacturing, cost and other barriers aside, the potential benefits of microrobotics to change how we respond to disease and our environment will fuel even greater advances in the field.\n\n“With some successful results, then hopefully, the whole field will even speed up more,” Sitti said.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",
      "# [What Is Caching? (Definition, How It Works, Types) by Mamta Singh on 2024-04-08](https://builtin.com/articles/caching)\nIn computing, the term caching refers to storing frequently accessed data temporarily in a faster memory or storage. This process improves performance by reducing the time and resources needed to fetch data from its main source. When data is cached, users can access the data faster than if it needed to come from slower storage, such as a disk or over the network.\n\nMore in Software EngineeringWhat Should You Look for When Hiring a Prompt Engineer?\n\nHow Does Caching Work?\n\nWhen a program needs to access particular data, it first checks the cache memory to see if it’s available. If the program finds the data there, that’s called a cache hit, and it retrieves the data quickly. If the data is not there, that’s called a cache miss, and the program then fetches the data from the main storage, such as a file or a web page, and adds it in the cache for future use.\n\nWeb browsers, for example, cache information such as images and scripts. When you revisit a website, the browser quickly loads the cached data instead of downloading it again, resulting in faster page load times.\n\nCache has limited storage space. If there is no room for the new data, the program uses cache replacement policy to remove older data from the cache to make room for the new data. For example, least recently accessed or least frequently used data may be removed. In some cases, cached data may need to be invalidated if it’s no longer relevant to ensure cache accuracy.\n\nCaching Benefits\n\nCaching comes with a number of other upsides:\n\nFaster Data Access: Caching can significantly reduce response time to access frequently requested data.\n\nImproved Performance: Lower data access latency improves overall computing performance by allowing applications to execute tasks quickly.\n\nResource Usage and Scalability: By reducing the load on the main data source, caching helps reduce resource usage, including lower CPU usage, disk I/O and network traffic. This makes the system more efficient and scalable.\n\nOffline Access: In some cases, caching allows users to access data or content offline, such as cached web page elements. This improves the user experience for those with limited connectivity.\n\nCost Savings: Due to lower resource usage and higher scalability, caching saves the cost of maintaining the main data source.\n\nTypes of Caching\n\nThere are several different types of cache used in computer systems. Here are some examples:\n\nBrowser Cache\n\nWeb browsers store images, scripts and style sheets locally. When a user returns to a web page they’ve previously browsed, the website can quickly retrieve content stored in browser cache and rearrange it without having to load everything all over again. This results in faster load times and a smoother online user experience.\n\nDisk Cache\n\nThis buffer cache is used in hard drives and solid-state drives to temporarily store recently accessed data from the disk while also improving read and write performance.\n\nDNS Cache\n\nDomain Name System, or DNS, servers maintain cache of domain name to IP addresses mapping. For example, if the domain name is Dropbox.com, it’s translated to an IP address like 162.125.1.18. This mapping from domainname<>ipaddress gets stored in DNS cache. When the next hit comes, the program won’t need to go to the main server to find the IP address for a domain.\n\nApplication Cache\n\nSome applications, such as database systems and web servers, implement custom caching to store frequently accessed data or query results to improve application responsiveness.\n\nCPU Cache\n\nCaching was initially invented to speed up code and data access by the CPU, or computer processing unit. The L1 cache, located on the CPU chip, is useful for frequently used code instructions and data to stop programs constantly fetching from the slower memory. The larger L2 cache serves as secondary storage, and is located closer to the CPU than the main memory. Finally, an even larger L3 cache can be shared among multiple CPU cores for frequently accessed data across those cores.\n\nCaching Use Cases\n\nBesides the types of caching described above, there are many other use cases that demonstrate the benefits of caching.\n\nCDNs\n\nContent Delivery Networks, or CDNs, cache static content such as images, videos and installation files across distributed edge servers located closer to users. This process reduces latency, improves speed and saves on costs for data access across geographically distributed audiences.\n\nSession Caching\n\nSession caching stores session data, including user authentication tokens during user sessions. This speeds up user interactions in web applications.\n\nOperating Systems\n\nOperating systems and file systems use caching to store recently accessed files or file metadata. This accelerates file read/write performance and reduces disk access to improve speed.\n\nSearch Engines\n\nSearch engines cache search results and indexed web pages to deliver faster search query responses.\n\nResources for Software EngineersCompanies Hiring AI Engineers\n\nCaching Best Practices\n\nCaching plays a significant role in optimizing system performance and improving user experience. The following suggestions will help you create an efficient caching strategy.\n\n1. Develop a Clear Goal\n\nEstablish goals that caching needs to accomplish, whether it be faster web page loading or an improved search engine experience. Take into account multiple audience segments as well to design a caching strategy that benefits the most users possible.\n\n2. Select a Cache Storage\n\nChoose a cache storage type that fulfills your goals and user needs. Depending on the application, in-memory caches like Redis or Memcached may work best. Otherwise, it might make more sense to use disk-based or distributed caches like Hazelcast or Apache Ignite.\n\n3. Prepare Your Data\n\nIdentify the data to cache in your application. Data that’s frequently accessed and does not change often is usually a good choice. Consider pre-loading this data into the cache on startup or during low-traffic periods.\n\n4. Develop Caching Strategies\n\nUse cache invalidation strategy to keep the cached data accurate. For instance, you might use time or event-based invalidation to invalidate state data. Implement cache-backing strategies, such as read-through and write-through, to ensure data consistency between the cache and main data source. Design cache keys to ensure efficient data retrieval and utilization. When applicable, implement tiered or layered cache to further optimize latency and performance.\n\n5. Protect Your Cache\n\nTake steps to secure cached data. Set up end-to-end encryption, strict access controls and other safeguards to defend against cyber attacks. To limit opportunities for hackers to strike, implement error handling and fallback to handle failures and timeouts gracefully.\n\n6. Evaluate Cache Performance\n\nMonitor cache performance including usage, hit rates and eviction rates. Adjust your strategy accordingly based on the results. Pick a shorter cache expiration period for volatile data and a longer expiration period for relatively static data. Stay aware of this timeline while observing cache to make sure it’s followed.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

I live in a very small town but have a specialized background (DevOps). I’m glad I made the decision to go full-remote. The room for growth, benefits, work/life balance, and pay were all better than anything I could find locally.\n\nHere is another pro-tip regarding looking up remote positions:\n\nWhen using Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Indeed, etc. search using their “Remote” flag to find remote positions.\n\nHowever, also be sure to look for positions in “Remote, OR”\n\nSome recruiters don’t list them correctly, or something gets messed up when copying the job listing all over (from one service to another). Typically these remote jobs (with positions listed in ‘Remote, OR’) have less applicants. Also Remote, Oregon is a small town so luckily it’s easy to see if the position was intended for the actual town or for “Remote”\n\n### Comment ID jd7pcz6 with +1 score by [(tennisguy163, Reddit, 2023-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/jd7pcz6/) (in reply to ID hm2b17u):\nGood god, one job on there has over 5,000 applicants.

Zip recruiter is nice where employers can “like” your resume or application, rate it, give feedback, and even contact you through it to say “you look qualified for our position.

But I was told about the opening by someone at the company a couple of hours before it was posted and was one of the first applicants, the first interviewee, and the first to go through the hiring process for the position, which gave me a deciding advantage it seems. But the only reason I knew about it was because someone told me about the position opening up and I was able to saw \"I heard about this position from Bob\" on the application and the screening call. Didn't say he referred me and I know he didn't have any internal referral but being able to say he told me about the position at least got me an interview.\n\nAs much as linked in sucks and is full of low quality guru crap, networking in it is the way to go.\n\n## Comment ID hm27esf with +7 score by [(btw_i_use_ubuntu, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm27esf/) (in reply to ID r1ynlc):\nIf you just search up \"[title] jobs [area]\" on Google, it will compile results from a bunch of different job posting sites.\n\n## Comment ID hm2ecfb with +6 score by [(justsomeguycmh, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm2ecfb/) (in reply to ID r1ynlc):\nClearancejobs is great if considering federal contractor positions.\n\n### Comment ID hm2g3as with +6 score by [(Meglamar, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm2g3as/) (in reply to ID hm2ecfb):\nThis.

Full time.  Last year during full on covid.\n\nLinkedIn, Indeed, and a network of recruiters I have come to know from many contracts I have done.  \n\nIndeed was the worst, and normally was just cross posts and never used the Indeed built in system\n\nLinkedIn was actually pretty awesome with the open to work feature and their revamped job searching. \n\nMy recruiter network got me a handful of interviews  and an offer.\n\nLinkedIn recruiter who got in touch with me actually got me the position, so a huge win for LinkedIn. I used the offer I had to knock my pay up even more.  Thanks job I was never going to take!\n\nThese recruiters use tools to search LinkedIn profiles for keywords, so your profile can literally make or break you.  These recruiters don't understand what x buzzword is. They spend seconds on your profile to see if you are a possible match and move on, so your profile should be as complete as possible..  Have some project work to give them an idea of what kind of work you can do.\n\nThe better my profile was, the more I got random recruiters  to contact me, and about better jobs.\n\nThis is the way now.  Learn it and get a better job.\n\n### Comment ID hmuxmau with +1 score by [(nicepersondonthate, Reddit, 2021-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hmuxmau/) (in reply to ID hm2lnfx):\nenjoy being replaced soon, since you used the \"i got another job offer card\", can only use that once then you are on their shit list.

That wasn't the point of the comment, though I guess I could have worded it better.  It was meant to be a quick response for OP's question.\n\nWhat actually happened in my case was that I received an offer for a higher paying job at a larger company.  At the same time I actually really liked the team and hit it off with the CIO at a smaller company, offering less.  I negotiated informing the smaller company that I really wanted the position, but that I had another offer at a higher pay.  The smaller company came back that if we wrapped the deal up immediately they would come up and match.\n\nIt wasn't that they didn't value me, they had a price they offered for the position.  On the contrary...They liked me, I liked them, but I informed them I had a higher offer.  They thought I was worth it and went above their original salary offer.\n\nAlmost two years in, I still love the position, love the team, have a much better work/life balance than had I taken the first offer, and so wouldn't change a thing.\n\nInforming a prospective employer that you have an existing offer, and negotiating to get yourself better pay/benefits/etc. seems is pretty standard.  Was it risky?  Sure, it had elevated risk that the job I really wanted to get would leave the table, but it was something I took a chance on, and it instead validated my belief that they did value me.  Also, I had no duty to the first company, and simply informed them I would be taking another offer.  No bridges burnt, so cards used, no shit list necessary.  It's just business.  \n\nI don't really think \"the proper amount\" exists.  We negotiate with what employers feel we are worth from a multitude of reasons and what that is can be different for the same person at the same positions at various companies.\n\n## Comment ID hm27j7q with +4 score by [(Zengaroni, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm27j7q/) (in reply to ID r1ynlc):\nI have always used LinkedIn.

Check out their websites. Apply to the gigs. Contact their recruiters on linkedin asking about the gig and if they are still hiring (e.g. get noticed.) Sometimes this can help you rise to the top.\n\nUltimately the job posting sites typically have lots of applicants. Often recruiting at places is poor and doesn't list in the right way or doesn't list anywhere but their own website, or they go through 3rd parties which don't tell you who you are working for up front.\n\nYou can get a job from many ways, just trying to offer an alternative method i've seen work. :)\n\n## Comment ID hm3iprg with +2 score by [(Big-Sploosh, Reddit, 2021-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm3iprg/) (in reply to ID r1ynlc):\nSpeaking as someone based in the US:\n\nLinkedIn and just applying directly on the company website.  Occasionally I'll use Indeed, but a lot of times it will just take you to the company career page anyway, use Indeed to find companies rather than single job postings.  There is also USAJobs if you are looking into 2210 series jobs for federal agencies, some hiring more frequently than others (Bureau of Land Management, Indian Health Service, EPA, and in the worst case scenario; the Bureau of Prisons...)  USAJobs is more useful for those eligible for things like Pathways internships\\\\Recent grad programs, as it effectively puts you into a totally different hiring pool instead of getting curb-stomped by every current federal employee and military veteran out there.\n\n## Comment ID hm45dmz with +2 score by [(CandiedColoredClown, Reddit, 2021-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm45dmz/) (in reply to ID r1ynlc):\njust LinkedIn.

You can even add which technologies you’ve utilized at roles the way LinkedIn is currently trying to add skills. Not all the jobs are technical, like programming or product management, but if you’re in the tech industry, that’s the niche the job board is in. \n\nSomething really nice about Otta is that they include the Glassdoor ratings for companies as well, which is great because sometimes startups, especially the earlier stage or ones with <500 employees, can be a bit dicey around inexperienced management and claiming work/life balance while in reality push the “hustle” mentality. \n\nThey’re great for finding Remote-based work as well, since a lot of startups/fast-paced growing companies don’t care yet about HR laws and regulations across different states, they care about the talent. Once companies get bigger and older, they typically only hire remotely from states where they have established entities because of all the paperwork and the need to stay up-to-date with individual state compliance.\n\n- Edited for clarity around tech industry/companies versus tech positions like programming.\n\n#### Comment ID ivb743n with +2 score by [(that_writer_dream, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/ivb743n/) (in reply to ID ivb0vfu):\nThey actually work with a pretty even amount of start-ups and large companies (Deliveroo, Bumble, Spotify, the Financial Times).

It's helped me land several interviews whereas on the company website you can easily get screened out. Apply on BOTH LinkedIn and the company website.\n\nThe benefit of LinkedIn easy apply is that for several companies (not all) let you just send in a resume without any additional info unlike the company site where you have to waste time copying your resume. Also, if you are getting screened out, recruiters can see your resume more easily through LinkedIn especially if you are one of the first applications. You often get notified if your resume gets read or downloaded, which doesn't mean anything, but gives you additional data on what types of roles and companies are interested.\n\nI've landed two solid jobs through LinkedIn easy apply.

If an offer sounds too good to be true, if the wording feels awkward and overly vague, etc.\n\nMuch of this knowledge just comes from being in an industry for a while and recognizing the normal way roles are talked about. \n\nThat said, here’s the steps I would recommend for everyone:\n\n1. Do enough research into your industry to recognize the standard job title naming conventions and job scope for your level. For example, an entry level marketing role is typically going to be called something like “marketing associate” or “marketing coordinator”, or more specific depending on branch of marketing, so “content marketing associate” etc. For job scope, there will be a few things in your industry that you’ll learn are red flags. For marketing, if they talk about outbound calling, prospecting, sales, etc. then it’s likely a sales role pretending to be a marketing role. If you don’t know what these red flags are in your industry, reach out to a more senior member of this industry through LinkedIn and ask them directly, “what red flags should I watch out for in job postings?”\n\n2. Assuming you find a role that passes the job title and job scope test, start Googling the company. Search for things like “ X company reviews” and “X company scam”. Then visit 1. The companies Glassdoor page 2. The company’s LinkedIn page 3. The company’s website\n\n2a. Does there Glassdoor have multiple positive reviews, salaries listed, etc? (If the company is a small startup, they may have limited info here but still be legit).\n\n2b. Is the company findable on LinkedIn? Do they have many people who say they work there?  Click into these people and make sure they all seem legit. To they have previous experience at different companies? Do they seem to be active profiles?\n\n2c. Finally, visit their website. Does it seem to be a full website? (Not just one or two pages). Does the branding seem trustworthy? Then find the internal job listings page on the website. Is the job listing you saw also listed on their website? If not, there’s a chance that the company is legit, but scammers are pretending to be from the company when they’re not.\n\nIf after all of this, the company still seems legitimate, than apply! When interviewing, make sure you:\n 1. Meet the interviewers face-to-face or on a video chat sometime in the interview process (most start with a phone screen, that’s okay as long as you video chat later). \n2. Only communicate with email addresses that are linked to the company. Example: john@amazon.com. \n3. Don’t give any personal banking or social security # information until contracts have been signed and finalized and you feel 200% sure they are for real.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n### Comment ID ivbjona with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/ivbjona/) (in reply to ID iva7h7u):\nkey word.  \"Depending on industries\".  lol\n\n## Comment ID iva2ufb with +33 score by [(LincHayes, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/iva2ufb/) (in reply to ID ynpo8w):\nIn my experience, after Linked In, the quality of postings, and recruiters goes down significantly.

I got laid off a month ago and went back to the misery of job huntng on LinkedIn. \n\nI was working in tech before, so i knew there was a better way. I wanted to essentially create something that would check my CV, and find the most relevant jobs on the internet to return them back to me in seconds. Better than spending hours on LinkedIn reading irrelevant long job postings (even skimming them was boring)\n\nThe apps i found would use ai to apply to jobs for you and I found some scary reviews. Apparently they just send applications made with AI absolutely everywhere hoping you land one. They are playing a number game basically. \n\nI knew the tool had to be an assistant. not an automation. The only automation id allow would be the one that finds the relevant jobs for me. the cv and cover letter writing can be supported by AI but not fully generated by AI. Something like a draft at most.\n\nAnyways... long story short. I took matter into my own hands and created [wizapply.app](http://wizapply.app) . While still at its early stage, there is a beta version that helps you quickly review job postings and generate TLDR sumamries with job score match to quickly decide if you want to read the whole thing or just move on. Quickly.  \n  \nThe next version is aimed at fully building the web app that creates lists of relevant job lsitings in just seconds.   \n  \nCurious to know if this is something anyone here would use\n\n## Comment ID ivahzlv with +2 score by [(supyonamesjosh, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/ivahzlv/) (in reply to ID ynpo8w):\nPeople you meet in real life\n\n## Comment ID kw9qpsf with +1 score by [(FitOrder4306, Reddit, 2024-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/kw9qpsf/) (in reply to ID ynpo8w):\nAs a former personnel director, using a head hunter service or employment agency is the best way to secure a permanent position. The cost to hire you is paid by the employer. The more money they have to pay for you, the more they actually value you. Companies who are willing to pay the fee to hire you have invested in you and will respect you more and won’t be as difficult to get raises in the future. Word of mouth can be good as well if you know someone or just choose where you want your work and make an appointment with Human resources.\n\n### Comment ID l2ivf6r with +1 score by [(Comprehensive_Sale69, Reddit, 2024-05-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/l2ivf6r/) (in reply to ID kw9qpsf):\ndo you have any head hunter services or employment agencies you can refer? i have reached out to a few companies myself and nothing is working out. i am also in a leadership position and don't seem to get any traction\n\n## Comment ID l6qu2i2 with +1 score by [(Salesgirl008, Reddit, 2024-06-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/l6qu2i2/) (in reply to ID ynpo8w):\nI have success finding my current job on Craigslist.

I got my current job by finding a company I wanted to work for, cold-emailing someone at the company who went to my same undergrad, and basically asked him for career advice. Did that like 10-15 times before it worked though.\n\nEdit: just wanted to add a couple of related pointers: (1) Any connection with the person will work. Doesn’t need to be that you went to the same college. Could be same hometown, etc. LinkedIn, Google (using the advanced search function), and company bios are your friends here. (2) Some jobs are posted even though the company already has a candidate in mind. Might be for DEI reasons, or maybe they want to say “we had 100 applicants apply for this one job!” This is where networking really helps out, because they might consider you before the job is even posted. (3) Job hunting is a numbers game. I literally applied to 84 jobs during my first search.

Or so I thought.\n\nThen, when I got hired at that company, my hiring manager explained to me that he hired me not because of my perceived understanding of their products, but because my skills and experience aligned with what they were looking for in that junior role. He then went on to explain to me that the applicant-facing product I had studied was just the tip of the iceberg because:\n\n1. **I only saw/experienced about 15% of this product.** The version of it I used appeared relatively static to me, as the user. But in reality, there was a lot of conditional logic on the back end that determined which questions I saw and which materials were required/optional/not asked based on things in my profile, the way I answered questions in other parts of the application, based on which type of device I accessed the application on, etc.\n2. **Though the most well-known product from this company was their applicant-facing product, there were about 6 other products that this UX role would be working on that were either B2B or strictly internal.** Things like configuration software, administration software, client support software, software for managing client implementations and integrations of our products, etc. etc. **There was essentially no (legal) way for me to have known that, nor to have accessed those products if I did somehow know that.**\n\nMy whole point with this lengthy comment is that you should be focusing (as the other commenters said) on how well your skill and experience align with what is being asked on the job description, and understand/expect that no matter how much time and work you put into getting to know a company's products, the reality of the situation is that you can never fully know until you work there how well you actually know their products.\n\n### Comment ID hqi12b6 with +1 score by [(Internet-Citizen, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqi12b6/) (in reply to ID hqhycbm):\nAnything for the UK?\n\n#### Comment ID hqi2sdi with +1 score by [(UXette, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqi2sdi/) (in reply to ID hqi12b6):\nDon't have anything, unfortunately\n\n#### Comment ID hqpn1jv with +1 score by [(UXette, Reddit, 2021-12-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqpn1jv/) (in reply to ID hqi12b6):\nThis site has a few UK postings: https://www.ideatelabs.co/job-board\n\n### Comment ID hqjqzpe with +1 score by [(Designflystretwerguy, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqjqzpe/) (in reply to ID hqhycbm):\nMdeng is a solid resource I would also follow him\nOn LinkedIn he promotes many internship and entry level roles.\n\n#### Comment ID i9djf1z with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/i9djf1z/) (in reply to ID hqjqzpe):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID hqixx6w with +10 score by [(TheComicSansKiller, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqixx6w/) (in reply to ID rroldx):\nFollow UXers on LinkedIn, leaders, managers, directors and so on.

Spamming resumes and applying to everything isn't a good general rule.  It isn't a good use of your time and it really gets you nowhere.  As someone who led a large design team and did over 70 interviews one year from hundreds of resumes, the carpet bombing approach might work for smaller startups but not for larger orgs.  You'll get lost in the noise.\n\nThat said, building connections is critical.  Make connections.  I don't mean spamming the connect button on LinkedIn, I mean sending a meaningful message - it will make you stand out.   You won't get a ton of replies but it makes you memorable.  Ideally not half assed but even half assed can be ok. So for instance sending a LinkedIn connection with the stock message = bad.  Sending one with a personal, unique but half-assed message = better.  Sending one with a hand tailored message that showed you researched the individual and their company = golden.\n\nSo for example, sending one that says \"hey, would love to connect, your experience with  doing UX for APIs is really interesting.\" is good.  Better is saying something like, \"Hey, would love to connect, your creation of a design system at YOURCOMPANY sounds really challenging, I've been studying how to improve communication of design tokens to designers and would love to chat about it with you some time.\"  This is why spamming doesn't work - start to get interested in specific things, take a deep dive - you don't have to commit to it for life but showing interest in a subject area makes you interesting to other people as well. Then find people who resonate with that subject.\n\n#### Comment ID hqkrxnl with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqkrxnl/) (in reply to ID hqjmu6k):\nYeah if you want to PM me go for it!!\n\n#### Comment ID hqksfeh with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqksfeh/) (in reply to ID hqjmu6k):\nBtw when I say apply, apply, apply,  I don’t mean spam. what I mean is, if it’s a job you want, a company you’re interested in, etc. apply, don’t be afraid.

So I don't know about the process of applying, but I can say that working for one has been very useful for learning. A government agency isn't driven by profit, so deadlines are lenient. They are also bound by their budget so they often can't afford the expensive senior designers, so I don't think it's uncommon for them to look for juniors, at least not in my country. Not all of them know about the benefits of UX though and might not be looking for one for that reason alone. However, having responsive and accessible websites is becoming more important for governments since excluding people with disabilities from a public service isn't legal. So it's not crazy to assume that some of them might be in dire need of some UX! Might be worth looking into.\n\n### Comment ID hqjnnqu with +2 score by [(DevelopMatt, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqjnnqu/) (in reply to ID hqj7fv8):\nNoted.

What I would emphasise is focus on creating a body of good work, and on top of that, networking, instead of cold applying  \n\n\nAll I had when I started was 1 *very good school project* that I worked my ass off on. When I say good I mean in the sense that \"client loved it, it got the highest possible grade, the professor wanted my group to write a paper about it\" - I made it the centerpiece of my portfolio when applied for an internship.  \n\n\nEnd of my first semester I saw a tweet from the head of a studio in my city while my exams were going on at my university, where I was studying my Master’s in Design. I was interested, so I looked a bit more at their website, and saw that they were a design studio that seemed working on some really cool problems!  \n\n\nI reached out to him with a sample of some work that I did and we had a call, where I wanted to learn more about the opportunities that were available.As I had my end of semester break, I realised that maybe I could come for 10 days as a quick “preview” and work on a small aspect of a problem. It would be a win-win situation. They would get some work that was of value to them, while I would gain experience and some stuff that would go on my portfolio (and be paid too)!  \n\n\nI proposed this over the call, and to my surprise and delight, he was interested. He discussed some projects they was working on, and later that day I sent a proposal outlining my various ideas for things that I could contribute to. I worked hard on the proposal, made a case for xyz thing and explained the different ideas I had.  \n\n\nI joined and impressed them enough that they called me back in the summer after my first year, and they offered me a job once my master's got over. I would have probably had zero luck had I waited till my master's was over and applied through their careers page, like everyone else.  \n\n\nI worked for a year there then they got battered by the pandemic so I went in-house at the ad-tech division of a tech company.\n\n### Comment ID hqplp60 with +1 score by [(DevelopMatt, Reddit, 2021-12-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqplp60/) (in reply to ID hqnf8ms):\nGreat story!

I got my first few jobs in the industry by impressing people at meetups who then told their teams they should hire me. \n\nUnfortunately, the global pandemic makes that a lot harder these days but I would recommend looking up local meetup groups / industry happy hours and local chapters of of groups like IxDA, UXPA, etc. My local groups still do online events about once a month and occasionally do in person during the better Covid times. If there aren’t any in your area I would look into UX discord or slack channels.\n\n### Comment ID hqk7cnc with +1 score by [(DevelopMatt, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqk7cnc/) (in reply to ID hqk4osy):\nGreat points!

Not quite peak plywood prices, but up there.  It was about $700 in plywood alone. Then another 300 for face frame poplar.  About 120 for hardware.  About 150 for paint (sw emerald urethane enamel). Say 10 for glue and wood filler. So you're already at $1300 in material. \n\nEach coat of paint took 4 hrs and I'm not a slow painter.  I rolled it though and didn't spray. So many books and crannies. So that's one coat for primer and two for the paint.  \n\nI couldn't tell you how many hrs it took me to actually build the thing.  That carpenter should be faster than me, but he only leaves $2.5k for labor, overhead and his profit margin.

Only had one issue where a company (Solstice) failed to disclose the position was 50% travel.  That's pretty basic information if you don't want to waste each other's time.  Though, I will say that my interview process has gone farther on average with LinkedIn (I pay for premium).  Recruiters are really hit and miss with that.  For IT, the 3rd party suburban recruiters are pretty brain dead - just want to fill the role so they get their commission, but don't understand what the job is about.  Much better luck with downtown companies and recruiters who genuinely dig into your skill set.  There's been more than a few companies where I started applying for one position, then we shifted to another in order to find the right match.\n\n### Comment ID ekn8mxp with +6 score by [(mockg, Reddit, 2019-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/bbr6sn/experiences_with_built_in_chicago/ekn8mxp/) (in reply to ID eklpx0m):\nHonestly I hate the 3rd party brain dead recruiters.

Another example was being approached for a copywriter position when the only thing close to that on my resume was that I had InDesign experience.  It's like, really?  You didn't even read the damn thing.  What really puts a recruiter above their peers though is when they spend time asking about my background and career objectives - it's really about building a relationship.  Sadly, too few get this.  I've gone out for coffee with a recruiter I knew nothing about, but they invited me, and the half hour with them was way more productive than any other phone call I've had otherwise.  In a way, it's like finding a normal personal/romantic relationship - you want someone who can adapt to your strengths and weaknesses.  Oh, and the other thing is how well they know the industry they are recruiting for.  I do give some leeway for IT though - understanding that if they were really good enough to completely know, let's say server administration, they probably wouldn't be a recruiter.  Maybe it's like the saying \"Those that can't... recruit!\"\n\n## Comment ID ekmm97e with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-04-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/bbr6sn/experiences_with_built_in_chicago/ekmm97e/) (in reply to ID bbr6sn):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID ekoyh3j with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-04-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/bbr6sn/experiences_with_built_in_chicago/ekoyh3j/) (in reply to ID ekmm97e):\nExactly why I haven't used Craigslist for employment opportunities in about 10 years.

How have the rentable campsites worked out for you? \n\nHas dealing with the general public been awful or has it been fairly straightforward? Are people respectful of any infrastructure you provide or are you fixing damaged things constantly?\n\n#### Comment ID i3oxzlx with +6 score by [(Robotman1001, Reddit, 2022-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/txp5a2/how_many_of_you_work_from_home_and_what_do_you_do/i3oxzlx/) (in reply to ID i3ocb37):\nIt’s been great so far, with a few minor exceptions. It’s mostly my wife who’s the face, as I’m more antisocial so I do site maintenance and prep, and help with social media. We’re listed on AirBnB, which before we did this we didn’t know campsites were or could be listed there. Most people who come are seasoned campers, so they know the drill and are clean and respectful. Our sites are bare ground, we offer a camp toilet and privacy tent, and we’re getting 1 pine picnic table per site this year. Only 1/3 sites has a burn pit, and we provide each site with a shovel, water, and fire extinguisher just in case. \n\nLast year was our first year and we randomly started it mid-season to great success. We have copious details and instructions on our listing, and we also have a paper map and instructions we give people when they arrive. The exceptions would be: 1 lady took the wrong road because she didn’t stop for a map; 1 idiot decided to use a throwing axe on one of our alder trees; a few people have left some garbage; and 1 family was “terrified for their lives” and left in the middle of the night, aka they were *not* campers. \n\nBut otherwise it’s been a great side hustle—we made around $6k I believe last year, and that was only half the season and not knowing what we were doing LOL. Eventually we want to expand and build some yurts for a glamping experience.\n\n## Comment ID i3ng4xv with +3 score by [(hiddenhugels, Reddit, 2022-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/txp5a2/how_many_of_you_work_from_home_and_what_do_you_do/i3ng4xv/) (in reply to ID txp5a2):\nI am lucky enough to have investments that pay a majority of my daily living expenses but I also run an online store, mine crypto, and produce a variety of goods (firewood, lumber, produce, etc) from the property.\n\n## Comment ID i3nmnzt with +3 score by [(kategoad, Reddit, 2022-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/txp5a2/how_many_of_you_work_from_home_and_what_do_you_do/i3nmnzt/) (in reply to ID txp5a2):\nThe husband works outside the home at a makerspace, and I work remotely in education for an association - basically a project manager/instructional designer/subject matter expert for professional education. Neither of us use our (PhD for him, JD for me) degrees that much.\n\nWe also sell our eggs, honey and wax products, but that is just to support my farmers market habit.\n\n## Comment ID i3osrjr with +3 score by [(Aspenchef, Reddit, 2022-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/txp5a2/how_many_of_you_work_from_home_and_what_do_you_do/i3osrjr/) (in reply to ID txp5a2):\nI wholesale real estate.

Been working from home the past 5 years, and off and on another 5 before that. My wife works from home as well, doing project coordination stuff. She went remote during covid and her company saw the value not only for them but for their employees in skipping the move back to office.\n\n## Comment ID i3rtjne with +3 score by [(turkeypooo, Reddit, 2022-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/txp5a2/how_many_of_you_work_from_home_and_what_do_you_do/i3rtjne/) (in reply to ID txp5a2):\nMy husband works from home, in law, there are a lot of options. You can work for a firm or for yourself. He has a client base where he does all communication, filing, payments online or over the phone. If he needs to meet a client, he goes in to the office to do so. (Maybe 1-2 month)\n\nOther people at his firm vary in how remotely they work. For example, HR is in another country and the boss / owner lives in another province. The clerks and admins never come in to the office and work entirely online from their homes. The litigation lawyers are in office every day. The mediation team only comes in when they have parties to mediate.\n\n## Comment ID i3p0xsr with +2 score by [(Sleepyoldbag, Reddit, 2022-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/txp5a2/how_many_of_you_work_from_home_and_what_do_you_do/i3p0xsr/) (in reply to ID txp5a2):\nI left my company and sell b2b just like I did there but on my own.

Toxic culture lead by toxic higher ups. 4 layoffs (maybe 5 now with a new one January 2024 that I saw...) and each time there was zero sympathy or explanation. Instead, each layoff added pressure to current employees who then had to triple their work load for no additional pay. One time I heard the CEO tell people in the office that they should get back to work, when they were talking about an INTERNAL committee they were on and tasked with. The office is a graveyard with a requirement to come in even though 90% of the desks are empty and one half of the office doesn't even have the lights on anymore. I hate office days because it is eerily quiet and the days are depressing. CEO and VPs are the definition of toxic. They are always on expensive vacations abroad while everyone else is worked to the bone, and the \"unlimited PTO/ half day Fridays\" are a joke. I never get to take a half day on a Friday because of the added work load, and hands get slapped if you take a day off even if it is for mental health. \n\nDEI is nonexistent.\n\nI do not see the culture or anything about the company improving because the same VPs and higher ups are always safe, who are truly causing the issues. They should be embarrassed but their egos are too big to ever feel that way. \n\nAlso base pay is a joke compared to any other company.",

I was also “quiet hired” to take on additional responsibilities without a raise or promotion. It was very discouraging to discover that Built In is engaged in the very practices it publicly preaches against. \n\nThe work-life balance was terrible. I worked until 10 or 11 most nights and most weekends, too. This was common on my team. We had to keep up with unreasonable KPIs while leaders resisted our attempts to improve processes. \n\nMany of the perks are mostly performative. If you want to use a wellness day to recover from burnout, you have to scramble twice as hard to get set up for your absence. Half-day Fridays are cool in theory, except the majority of my team worked Friday afternoons anyway to keep up with unreasonable workloads. Unlimited PTO apparently does have limits, a colleague was once told that they shouldn’t take more than ~13 days, and it is possible to get written up for “excessive PTO.” \n\nSo the company loves to dangle these perks as differentiators when they lack meaning in practice.\n\nThere have been four layoffs since October 2022. Two public RIFs, a quiet restructuring, and a more recent silent layoff where remaining employees only found out through LinkedIn posts from their impacted colleagues. Despite the writing on the wall, the leadership remains toxically positive, bordering on delusion. At all-hands meetings, the CEO espouses a hustle mentality, insinuating that the grind and a positive attitude will pay off for everyone (except those who were laid off, obviously) and that the company is winning. I’ll never forget when – a few days after the second RIF – the company kicked off the next all-hands with upbeat pop music and the CEO telling the remaining staff to stay off LinkedIn because it was too depressing.\n\nI’m sure there will be a careful response to this review, as there is on all of the others. So I'll proactively say, in regards to pay transparency that would have addressed my pay disparity, the company said \"they were working on it\" for 2 years and eventually rolled out a disappointing, opaque process. And ultimately, they can’t say anything to change my experience – but I’m one of the few who got off easy. Many others are afraid to post their honest accounts of working at Built In out of concern for the NDA signed in exchange for severance during the many layoffs. \n\nMy advice to jobseekers considering a job here? Do NOT buy into the gospel or sacrifice yourself. Negotiate the heck out of your job offer and always remember: you are disposable.",

It's for people who are hungry, and that's probably the biggest pro we've got.\r\n\r\nThe team at Built In, regardless of department, is a fervent entrepreneurial set. That makes sense, since our primary goal is to help companies grow and prosper. But it's also good news internally: We're growing like crazy and have sky-high goals, and we come in each and every day eager to build, rather than celebrate yesterday’s successes (and there are plenty). Every player on the team is passionate, forward-thinking, collaborative, humble — and working first and foremost toward what’s best for the company. \r\n\r\nEven still, that mentality unlocks plenty of professional growth. In my three-plus years at Built In, I have watched my peers grow into outstanding leaders of the company. I’ve cheered them on as they’ve chased new opportunities and tackled increasingly larger challenges, and they’ve done the same for me. And every new member of every single team has just as much opportunity to step up in a similar fashion. \r\n\r\nSo, yeah, Built In isn’t for everybody. But for those of us who prefer to keep those sleeves rolled up, you couldn’t ask for a more fulfilling place to work — or a better team to do it with.",

In the past I have worked for some bad (and I mean bad) companies who truly do not care about their employees. When joining Built In I saw a whole different world than what I was used to. Employee success, culture, wellness, and actual happiness are at the forefront of how Built In treats their employees regardless of the market. I can honestly say I ENJOY working each day, and so do those around me. Keeping a good attitude and drive during a rough market is hard to do and not for everyone, but I am surrounded by people who genuinely care which is so cool.

There is a mean girls, tribe mentality that forces out anyone with real experience. This results in a chaotic strategy and magical thinking. The CEO is convinced that the product is an enterprise offering, but it cannot support large companies. There is also a push to move internationally before the product provides value in US markets.\r\n\r\nExperienced leaders turn over quickly and then they are blamed for the failings of the company. It's a burnout factory where the CEO can't stand it if someone else's ideas are successful. Once you challenge, you are pushed out.\r\n\r\nThe senior sales team is comprised of some of inexperienced sales people who are friends with leadership. \r\n\r\nThe product is old technology and poorly integrated across sites. There is enough technical debt to cripple the platform, but it is never addressed because they are always pursuing shiny objects with no proof that there is market need for the solution.\r\n\r\nPoor planning, lack of strategy and, copycat mentality have resulted in four layoffs over the past 2 years. Even when they promise that it will be the last.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of talk about the company being people first and valuing diversity. It's lip service.\r\n\r\nIf you want to just show up and agree with the leadership, you'll do fine. If you want to get anything done or make an impact, look elsewhere.",

Not even counting the numerous 'Director' level positions that have come and gone. Look into median (instead of average) tenure of leadership positions. -Siloed functions. Teams don't work together within their functions, nor do they collaborate across functions. What is product working on? No idea because a product roadmap is not communicated broadly. -Culture. Toxic, plain and simple. Watch out for the most tenured employees, especially in sales and up to the founder and cofounder. Either get in line or prepare to be ostracized. Leading with solutions is a value, but only if it jives with the CEO's agenda. Otherwise, speaking up will mark you for a PIP or for layoffs. -Career progression. Ask HR, there has been a plan for career laddering the last 3 years with no implementation. DE&amp;I is a facade and the team should spend more time focusing on improving culture, community, and investigating employee concerns rather than vanity metrics or responding to these reviews.",

Please know that we do read these, share with leadership, and work collaboratively to make appropriate improvements based on these insights.\r\n\r\nBuilt In has always operated with a people-first mindset, and we agree that there are great, hard working, caring employees who make Built In what it is.\r\n\r\nLike many others, Built In has been impacted by today’s market and the macro economics surrounding the industry. To those employees who were impacted by layoffs, we offered competitive packages, provided resume and interviewing coaching, and offered personal introductions to companies who are hiring. \r\n\r\nWe are doing our best to navigate this new normal and make decisions in the best interest of our people as well as the business.For example, we encourage all of our leaders to manage their teams independently, while cohesively operating under unified values and business practices. What works for one team may not work for another. Which is why we’ve introduced a Flex Work Policy for all of our employees. We offer both Flex Mode and Remote Mode, where you may have the opportunity to work remotely based on your role and function - or enjoy the perks of being in the office on a hybrid schedule. Some departments may choose to designate additional in-office days, but our philosophy is to encourage flexibility to support personal work styles while balancing business needs.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to our leadership, we are proud to have a leadership team with an average tenure of 7.75 years. When you have a group of individuals who work together for that long, it’s natural that friendships form and we’re proud of the deep trust this team has in each other. It allows us to move fast, be innovative, and have deep alignment with our strategic initiatives. The leaders who we’ve brought on board over the last 1-2 years came in for growth and those leaders are not always the type of leaders who can operate in market downturns.  We’re proud of the leaders we have in place and their commitment to supporting and empowering our people is unwavering. \r\n\r\nIf you have additional questions or other concerns you’d like us to address - please feel free to get in touch directly!",

Like most tech companies, we were impacted by the most recent market downturn and experienced the need to downsize some of our sales team members. We are in an economic climate that demands constant change of organizations, and our leadership team is dedicated to the success of our people as we emerge stronger than ever before. We continue to invest in developing as people-leaders, as the success of any organization is deeply rooted in the satisfaction and well-being of its employees. \n\nWe take pride in our offerings, and we are disappointed to hear that you found them subpar. We are constantly working to enhance our products and services, and have invested heavily in these by bringing in a Chief Technology Officer and doubling down on R&amp;D to get us to a spot to go international in the near future. We are pleased to say that our products will continue to be enhanced in our pursuit of delivering top results to our tech visitors and customers. \n\nIf you are open to it, we would appreciate the opportunity to discuss your concerns in more detail and gather additional insights that can help us address specific issues. You can reach out directly to our CEO or to our Head of People at any time.  We take all feedback seriously, and your insights are invaluable as we continuously strive to improve our organization.",

Expect to be on 8-10 hours of meetings per week just doing “ice breakers” and being forced to share personal information with your work colleagues. And if you happen to want to go off camera, or ask for any form of work/life balance?

We only wish you would have done so while you were employed with us, as we would have appreciated the opportunity to address these issues directly with you.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to be an organization built and led by women. Individuals who identify as women account for 58% of our employee population, 55% of all managers and 53% of our leadership team. \r\n\r\nWe conducted our first annual anonymous DEI survey in Q4 of 2021 and across the board, women rated our company more favorably than their peers. For example, participants who identified as women gave the following ratings:\r\n- 96% favorability for “I feel respected at Built In,” \r\n- 91% favorability for “I feel like I belong at Built In,”\r\n- 87% favorability for “At Built In there is open and honest two-way communication” \r\n- 81% favorable for “I can voice a contrary opinion without fear of negative consequences” \r\nWe’re disappointed that you don’t feel you had a similar experience while you were employed with us.\r\n\r\nWe take the safety and wellbeing of our employees very seriously. We conduct annual harassment prevention training for all employees and recently invested in a platform that is trauma-informed, trigger free, and provides the most marginalized individuals with additional resources. \r\n\r\nWe have a longstanding written anti-harassment policy that provides multiple reporting avenues.  Again, we wish you had utilized our policy and brought your concerns to our attention during your employment with us, as we would have followed our outlined protocol by asking you to provide the facts underlying your concerns and promptly investigating those concerns. \r\n\r\nWe would like the opportunity to investigate your concerns now that you have made us aware of them, so we encourage you to reach out directly to any member of our People Team so that we can obtain the additional information we need in order to do so.  Thank you again.\r\n\r\nWe’re surprised to hear your comment about a lack of diversity. While we recognize that we have work to do and we are committed to fulfilling the commitments of our annual DEI roadmap, we can confirm that every department in our company has diverse representation.",

We’re so glad that you felt connected to your teammates and the people around you. \r\n\r\nAs a recruitment marketing platform, our customers often reside in HR &amp; Talent positions. We have seen great success in hiring folks from the staffing world as they deeply understand our buyer persona and our industry as a whole! That said, Built In has always been committed to hiring top talent, and prioritizes both diversity of thought and experience - especially for roles that manage people.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to build long lasting teams with inspired leaders, and we are proud to share that our employees have an overall average tenure of 3.1 years, with Management at an average tenure of 4.4 Years. Specifically on our Account Management team the average employee tenure is 3.4 years, with a management tenure of 4.9 years. This is well above the industry average, which is something we are incredibly proud of.\r\n\r\nRegarding our Revenue infrastructure, we endeavor to set our teams up for optimal success, and recognize there are always areas for improvement. While we absolutely make mistakes, we make what we believe to be the best decisions based on the information we had at that time. Most importantly, those decisions and changes are always well-intentioned with the Account Manager and customer as the priority. However, what worked years ago, does not always continue to be the best approach. The past 12 months forced us to move swiftly related to territories/books, commission structure and we’re proud of the changes we’ve made in the positive direction the past 6 months to allow for a more equitable and predictable environment.\r\n\r\nThanks again for sharing your thoughts.

In my three-plus years at Built In, I have watched my peers grow into outstanding leaders of the company. I’ve cheered them on as they’ve chased new opportunities and tackled increasingly larger challenges, and they’ve done the same for me. And every new member of every single team has just as much opportunity to step up in a similar fashion. \r\n\r\nSo, yeah, Built In isn’t for everybody.

I was also “quiet hired” to take on additional responsibilities without a raise or promotion. It was very discouraging to discover that Built In is engaged in the very practices it publicly preaches against. \n\nThe work-life balance was terrible. I worked until 10 or 11 most nights and most weekends, too. This was common on my team. We had to keep up with unreasonable KPIs while leaders resisted our attempts to improve processes. \n\nMany of the perks are mostly performative. If you want to use a wellness day to recover from burnout, you have to scramble twice as hard to get set up for your absence. Half-day Fridays are cool in theory, except the majority of my team worked Friday afternoons anyway to keep up with unreasonable workloads. Unlimited PTO apparently does have limits, a colleague was once told that they shouldn’t take more than ~13 days, and it is possible to get written up for “excessive PTO.” \n\nSo the company loves to dangle these perks as differentiators when they lack meaning in practice.\n\nThere have been four layoffs since October 2022. Two public RIFs, a quiet restructuring, and a more recent silent layoff where remaining employees only found out through LinkedIn posts from their impacted colleagues. Despite the writing on the wall, the leadership remains toxically positive, bordering on delusion. At all-hands meetings, the CEO espouses a hustle mentality, insinuating that the grind and a positive attitude will pay off for everyone (except those who were laid off, obviously) and that the company is winning. I’ll never forget when – a few days after the second RIF – the company kicked off the next all-hands with upbeat pop music and the CEO telling the remaining staff to stay off LinkedIn because it was too depressing.\n\nI’m sure there will be a careful response to this review, as there is on all of the others. So I'll proactively say, in regards to pay transparency that would have addressed my pay disparity, the company said \"they were working on it\" for 2 years and eventually rolled out a disappointing, opaque process. And ultimately, they can’t say anything to change my experience – but I’m one of the few who got off easy. Many others are afraid to post their honest accounts of working at Built In out of concern for the NDA signed in exchange for severance during the many layoffs. \n\nMy advice to jobseekers considering a job here?

Instead, each layoff added pressure to current employees who then had to triple their work load for no additional pay. One time I heard the CEO tell people in the office that they should get back to work, when they were talking about an INTERNAL committee they were on and tasked with. The office is a graveyard with a requirement to come in even though 90% of the desks are empty and one half of the office doesn't even have the lights on anymore. I hate office days because it is eerily quiet and the days are depressing. CEO and VPs are the definition of toxic. They are always on expensive vacations abroad while everyone else is worked to the bone, and the \"unlimited PTO/ half day Fridays\" are a joke. I never get to take a half day on a Friday because of the added work load, and hands get slapped if you take a day off even if it is for mental health. \n\nDEI is nonexistent.\n\nI do not see the culture or anything about the company improving because the same VPs and higher ups are always safe, who are truly causing the issues.

      "# [14 Dangers of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by Mike Thomas on 2023-02-08](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/risks-of-artificial-intelligence)\nAs AI grows more sophisticated and widespread, the voices warning against the potential dangers of artificial intelligence grow louder.\n\n“These things could get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over, and we need to worry now about how we prevent that happening,” said Geoffrey Hinton, known as the “Godfather of AI” for his foundational work on machine learning and neural network algorithms. In 2023, Hinton left his position at Google so that he could “talk about the dangers of AI,” noting a part of him even regrets his life’s work.\n\nThe renowned computer scientist isn’t alone in his concerns.\n\nTesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, along with over 1,000 other tech leaders, urged in a 2023 open letter to put a pause on large AI experiments, citing that the technology can “pose profound risks to society and humanity.”\n\nWhether it’s the increasing automation of certain jobs, gender and racially biased algorithms or autonomous weapons that operate without human oversight (to name just a few), unease abounds on a number of fronts. And we’re still in the very early stages of what AI is really capable of.\n\n14 Dangers of AI\n\nQuestions about who’s developing AI and for what purposes make it all the more essential to understand its potential downsides. Below we take a closer look at the possible dangers of artificial intelligence and explore how to manage its risks.\n\n1. Lack of AI Transparency and Explainability\n\nAI and deep learning models can be difficult to understand, even for those who work directly with the technology. This leads to a lack of transparency for how and why AI comes to its conclusions, creating a lack of explanation for what data AI algorithms use, or why they may make biased or unsafe decisions. These concerns have given rise to the use of explainable AI, but there’s still a long way before transparent AI systems become common practice.\n\nTo make matters worse, AI companies continue to remain tight-lipped about their products. Former employees of OpenAI and Google DeepMind have accused both companies of concealing the potential dangers of their AI tools. This secrecy leaves the general public unaware of possible threats and makes it difficult for lawmakers to take proactive measures ensuring AI is developed responsibly.\n\n2. Job Losses Due to AI Automation\n\nAI-powered job automation is a pressing concern as the technology is adopted in industries like marketing, manufacturing and healthcare. By 2030, tasks that account for up to 30 percent of hours currently being worked in the U.S. economy could be automated — with Black and Hispanic employees left especially vulnerable to the change — according to McKinsey. Goldman Sachs even states 300 million full-time jobs could be lost to AI automation.\n\n“The reason we have a low unemployment rate, which doesn’t actually capture people that aren’t looking for work, is largely that lower-wage service sector jobs have been pretty robustly created by this economy,” futurist Martin Ford told Built In. With AI on the rise, though, “I don’t think that’s going to continue.”\n\nAs AI robots become smarter and more dexterous, the same tasks will require fewer humans. And while AI is estimated to create 97 million new jobs by 2025, many employees won’t have the skills needed for these technical roles and could get left behind if companies don’t upskill their workforces.\n\n“If you’re flipping burgers at McDonald’s and more automation comes in, is one of these new jobs going to be a good match for you?” Ford said. “Or is it likely that the new job requires lots of education or training or maybe even intrinsic talents — really strong interpersonal skills or creativity — that you might not have? Because those are the things that, at least so far, computers are not very good at.”\n\nAs technology strategist Chris Messina has pointed out, fields like law and accounting are primed for an AI takeover as well. In fact, Messina said, some of them may well be decimated. AI already is having a significant impact on medicine. Law and accounting are next, Messina said, the former being poised for “a massive shakeup.”\n\n“It’s a lot of attorneys reading through a lot of information — hundreds or thousands of pages of data and documents. It’s really easy to miss things,” Messina said. “So AI that has the ability to comb through and comprehensively deliver the best possible contract for the outcome you’re trying to achieve is probably going to replace a lot of corporate attorneys.”\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceAI Copywriting: Why Writing Jobs Are Safe\n\n3. Social Manipulation Through AI Algorithms\n\nSocial manipulation also stands as a danger of artificial intelligence. This fear has become a reality as politicians rely on platforms to promote their viewpoints, with one example being Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., wielding a TikTok troll army to capture the votes of younger Filipinos during the Philippines’ 2022 election.\n\nTikTok, which is just one example of a social media platform that relies on AI algorithms, fills a user’s feed with content related to previous media they’ve viewed on the platform. Criticism of the app targets this process and the algorithm’s failure to filter out harmful and inaccurate content, raising concerns over TikTok’s ability to protect its users from misleading information.\n\nOnline media and news have become even murkier in light of AI-generated images and videos, AI voice changers as well as deepfakes infiltrating political and social spheres. These technologies make it easy to create realistic photos, videos, audio clips or replace the image of one figure with another in an existing picture or video. As a result, bad actors have another avenue for sharing misinformation and war propaganda, creating a nightmare scenario where it can be nearly impossible to distinguish between credible and faulty news.\n\n“No one knows what’s real and what’s not,” Ford said. “You literally cannot believe your own eyes and ears; you can’t rely on what, historically, we’ve considered to be the best possible evidence ... That’s going to be a huge issue.”\n\n4. Social Surveillance With AI Technology\n\nIn addition to its more existential threat, Ford is focused on the way AI will adversely affect privacy and security. A prime example is China’s use of facial recognition technology in offices, schools and other venues. Besides tracking a person’s movements, the Chinese government may be able to gather enough data to monitor a person’s activities, relationships and political views.\n\nAnother example is U.S. police departments embracing predictive policing algorithms to anticipate where crimes will occur. The problem is that these algorithms are influenced by arrest rates, which disproportionately impact Black communities. Police departments then double down on these communities, leading to over-policing and questions over whether self-proclaimed democracies can resist turning AI into an authoritarian weapon.\n\n“Authoritarian regimes use or are going to use it,” Ford said. “The question is, ‘How much does it invade Western countries, democracies, and what constraints do we put on it?’”\n\nRelatedAre Police Robots the Future of Law Enforcement?\n\n5. Lack of Data Privacy Using AI Tools\n\nA 2024 AvePoint survey found that the top concern among companies is data privacy and security. And businesses may have good reason to be hesitant, considering the large amounts of data concentrated in AI tools and the lack of regulation regarding this information.\n\nAI systems often collect personal data to customize user experiences or to help train the AI models you’re using (especially if the AI tool is free). Data may not even be considered secure from other users when given to an AI system, as one bug incident that occurred with ChatGPT in 2023 “allowed some users to see titles from another active user’s chat history.” While there are laws present to protect personal information in some cases in the United States, there is no explicit federal law that protects citizens from data privacy harm caused by AI.\n\nRelated ReadingAI-Generated Content and Copyright Law: What We Know\n\n6. Biases Due to AI\n\nVarious forms of AI bias are detrimental too. Speaking to the New York Times, Princeton computer science professor Olga Russakovsky said AI bias goes well beyond gender and race. In addition to data and algorithmic bias (the latter of which can “amplify” the former), AI is developed by humans — and humans are inherently biased.\n\n“A.I. researchers are primarily people who are male, who come from certain racial demographics, who grew up in high socioeconomic areas, primarily people without disabilities,” Russakovsky said. “We’re a fairly homogeneous population, so it’s a challenge to think broadly about world issues.”\n\nThe narrow views of individuals have culminated in an AI industry that leaves out a range of perspectives. According to UNESCO, only 100 of the world’s 7,000 natural languages have been used to train top chatbots. It doesn’t help that 90 percent of online higher education materials are already produced by European Union and North American countries, further restricting AI’s training data to mostly Western sources.\n\nThe limited experiences of AI creators may explain why speech-recognition AI often fails to understand certain dialects and accents, or why companies fail to consider the consequences of a chatbot impersonating historical figures. If businesses and legislators don’t exercise greater care to avoid recreating powerful prejudices, AI biases could spread beyond corporate contexts and exacerbate societal issues like housing discrimination.\n\n7. Socioeconomic Inequality as a Result of AI\n\nIf companies refuse to acknowledge the inherent biases baked into AI algorithms, they may compromise their DEI initiatives through AI-powered recruiting. The idea that AI can measure the traits of a candidate through facial and voice analyses is still tainted by racial biases, reproducing the same discriminatory hiring practices businesses claim to be eliminating.\n\nWidening socioeconomic inequality sparked by AI-driven job loss is another cause for concern, revealing the class biases of how AI is applied. Workers who perform more manual, repetitive tasks have experienced wage declines as high as 70 percent because of automation, with office and desk workers remaining largely untouched in AI’s early stages. However, the increase in generative AI use is already affecting office jobs, making for a wide range of roles that may be more vulnerable to wage or job loss than others.\n\n8. Weakening Ethics and Goodwill Because of AI\n\nAlong with technologists, journalists and political figures, even religious leaders are sounding the alarm on AI’s potential pitfalls. In a 2023 Vatican meeting and in his message for the 2024 World Day of Peace, Pope Francis called for nations to create and adopt a binding international treaty that regulates the development and use of AI.\n\nPope Francis warned against AI’s ability to be misused, and “create statements that at first glance appear plausible but are unfounded or betray biases.” He stressed how this could bolster campaigns of disinformation, distrust in communications media, interference in elections and more — ultimately increasing the risk of “fueling conflicts and hindering peace.”\n\nThe rapid rise of generative AI tools gives these concerns more substance. Many users have applied the technology to get out of writing assignments, threatening academic integrity and creativity. Plus, biased AI could be used to determine whether an individual is suitable for a job, mortgage, social assistance or political asylum, producing possible injustices and discrimination, noted Pope Francis.\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceWhat Are AI Ethics?\n\n9. Autonomous Weapons Powered By AI\n\nAs is too often the case, technological advancements have been harnessed for warfare. When it comes to AI, some are keen to do something about it before it’s too late: In a 2016 open letter, over 30,000 individuals, including AI and robotics researchers, pushed back against the investment in AI-fueled autonomous weapons.\n\n“The key question for humanity today is whether to start a global AI arms race or to prevent it from starting,” they wrote. “If any major military power pushes ahead with AI weapon development, a global arms race is virtually inevitable, and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious: autonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow.”\n\nThis prediction has come to fruition in the form of Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems, which locate and destroy targets on their own while abiding by few regulations. Because of the proliferation of potent and complex weapons, some of the world’s most powerful nations have given in to anxieties and contributed to a tech cold war.\n\nMany of these new weapons pose major risks to civilians on the ground, but the danger becomes amplified when autonomous weapons fall into the wrong hands. Hackers have mastered various types of cyber attacks, so it’s not hard to imagine a malicious actor infiltrating autonomous weapons and instigating absolute armageddon.\n\nIf political rivalries and warmongering tendencies are not kept in check, artificial intelligence could end up being applied with the worst intentions. Some fear that, no matter how many powerful figures point out the dangers of artificial intelligence, we’re going to keep pushing the envelope with it if there’s money to be made.\n\n“The mentality is, ‘If we can do it, we should try it; let’s see what happens,” Messina said. “‘And if we can make money off it, we’ll do a whole bunch of it.’ But that’s not unique to technology. That’s been happening forever.’”\n\n10. Financial Crises Brought About By AI Algorithms\n\nThe financial industry has become more receptive to AI technology’s involvement in everyday finance and trading processes. As a result, algorithmic trading could be responsible for our next major financial crisis in the markets.\n\nWhile AI algorithms aren’t clouded by human judgment or emotions, they also don’t take into account contexts, the interconnectedness of markets and factors like human trust and fear. These algorithms then make thousands of trades at a blistering pace with the goal of selling a few seconds later for small profits. Selling off thousands of trades could scare investors into doing the same thing, leading to sudden crashes and extreme market volatility.\n\nInstances like the 2010 Flash Crash and the Knight Capital Flash Crash serve as reminders of what could happen when trade-happy algorithms go berserk, regardless of whether rapid and massive trading is intentional.\n\nThis isn’t to say that AI has nothing to offer to the finance world. In fact, AI algorithms can help investors make smarter and more informed decisions on the market. But finance organizations need to make sure they understand their AI algorithms and how those algorithms make decisions. Companies should consider whether AI raises or lowers their confidence before introducing the technology to avoid stoking fears among investors and creating financial chaos.\n\n11. Loss of Human Influence\n\nAn overreliance on AI technology could result in the loss of human influence — and a lack in human functioning — in some parts of society. Using AI in healthcare could result in reduced human empathy and reasoning, for instance. And applying generative AI for creative endeavors could diminish human creativity and emotional expression. Interacting with AI systems too much could even cause reduced peer communication and social skills. So while AI can be very helpful for automating daily tasks, some question if it might hold back overall human intelligence, abilities and need for community.\n\n12. Uncontrollable Self-Aware AI\n\nThere also comes a worry that AI will progress in intelligence so rapidly that it will become sentient, and act beyond humans’ control — possibly in a malicious manner. Alleged reports of this sentience have already been occurring, with one popular account being from a former Google engineer who stated the AI chatbot LaMDA was sentient and speaking to him just as a person would. As AI’s next big milestones involve making systems with artificial general intelligence, and eventually artificial superintelligence, cries to completely stop these developments continue to rise.\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceWhat Is the Eliza Effect?\n\n13. Increased Criminal Activity\n\nAs AI technology has become more accessible, the number of people using it for criminal activity has risen. Online predators can now generate images of children, making it difficult for law enforcement to determine actual cases of child abuse. And even in cases where children aren’t physically harmed, the use of children’s faces in AI-generated images presents new challenges for protecting children’s online privacy and digital safety.\n\nVoice cloning has also become an issue, with criminals leveraging AI-generated voices to impersonate other people and commit phone scams. These examples merely scratch the surface of AI’s capabilities, so it will only become harder for local and national government agencies to adjust and keep the public informed of the latest AI-driven threats.\n\n14. Broader Economic and Political Instability\n\nOverinvesting in a specific material or sector can put economies in a precarious position. Like steel, AI could run the risk of drawing so much attention and financial resources that governments fail to develop other technologies and industries. Plus, overproducing AI technology could result in dumping the excess materials, which could potentially fall into the hands of hackers and other malicious actors.\n\nHow to Mitigate the Risks of AI\n\nAI still has numerous benefits, like organizing health data and powering self-driving cars. To get the most out of this promising technology, though, some argue that plenty of regulation is necessary.\n\n“There’s a serious danger that we’ll get [AI systems] smarter than us fairly soon and that these things might get bad motives and take control,” Hinton told NPR. “This isn’t just a science fiction problem. This is a serious problem that’s probably going to arrive fairly soon, and politicians need to be thinking about what to do about it now.”\n\nDevelop Legal Regulations\n\nAI regulation has been a main focus for dozens of countries, and now the U.S. and European Union are creating more clear-cut measures to manage the rising sophistication of artificial intelligence. In fact, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) published the AI Bill of Rights in 2022, a document outlining to help responsibly guide AI use and development. Additionally, President Joe Biden issued an executive order in 2023 requiring federal agencies to develop new rules and guidelines for AI safety and security.\n\nAlthough legal regulations mean certain AI technologies could eventually be banned, it doesn’t prevent societies from exploring the field.\n\nFord argues that AI is essential for countries looking to innovate and keep up with the rest of the world.\n\n“You regulate the way AI is used, but you don’t hold back progress in basic technology. I think that would be wrong-headed and potentially dangerous,” Ford said. “We decide where we want AI and where we don’t; where it’s acceptable and where it’s not. And different countries are going to make different choices.”\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceWill This Election Year Be a Turning Point for AI Regulation?\n\nEstablish Organizational AI Standards and Discussions\n\nOn a company level, there are many steps businesses can take when integrating AI into their operations. Organizations can develop processes for monitoring algorithms, compiling high-quality data and explaining the findings of AI algorithms. Leaders could even make AI a part of their company culture and routine business discussions, establishing standards to determine acceptable AI technologies.\n\nGuide Tech With Humanities Perspectives\n\nThough when it comes to society as a whole, there should be a greater push for tech to embrace the diverse perspectives of the humanities. Stanford University AI researchers Fei-Fei Li and John Etchemendy make this argument in a 2019 blog post that calls for national and global leadership in regulating artificial intelligence:\n\n“The creators of AI must seek the insights, experiences and concerns of people across ethnicities, genders, cultures and socio-economic groups, as well as those from other fields, such as economics, law, medicine, philosophy, history, sociology, communications, human-computer-interaction, psychology, and Science and Technology Studies (STS).”\n\nBalancing high-tech innovation with human-centered thinking is an ideal method for producing responsible AI technology and ensuring the future of AI remains hopeful for the next generation. The dangers of artificial intelligence should always be a topic of discussion, so leaders can figure out ways to wield the technology for noble purposes.\n\n“I think we can talk about all these risks, and they’re very real,” Ford said. “But AI is also going to be the most important tool in our toolbox for solving the biggest challenges we face.”\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

      "# [Unconscious Bias: Definition and Examples by Bailey Reiners on 2023-02-08](https://builtin.com/diversity-inclusion/unconscious-bias-examples)\nUnconscious bias, or implicit bias, describes a subconscious attitude that affects the way individuals feel and think about others around them. Subconscious attitudes aren’t necessarily as well-formed as coherent thoughts, but they can be very ingrained and impact the emotional and rational responses of individuals in everyday situations.\n\nWhat Is Unconscious Bias?\n\nUnconscious bias refers to a prejudice or stereotype an individual may hold about a particular group of people that they aren’t fully aware of. Also known as implicit bias, this bias can be directed toward people of certain races, gender identities, sexual orientations, physical abilities or even personal traits.\n\nBiases and prejudices often develop in early childhood as children begin to make assumptions based on personal experiences. They may also receive stereotypes from parents, education systems and other cultural institutions, as well as from popular forms of media such as books, movies and television. As a result, unconscious biases can be forged over many years while going undetected.\n\nSome of the most common types of unconscious biases are in how individuals regard their own thought processes and reasoning abilities, such as focusing on negative qualities of individuals that align with one’s existing attitudes — like in confirmation bias and affirmation bias.\n\nOther unconscious biases are directly related to how other people may look. These types of biases tend to rely on stereotypes and can result in discriminatory practices when people are not treated like individuals, such as racism, ageism and beauty bias.\n\n18 Examples of Unconscious Bias in the Workplace\n\nWe’ve identified 18 types of unconscious bias that commonly affect candidates and employees, and also provided some tips for how to avoid them when hiring and retaining employees.\n\n1. Affinity Bias\n\nAffinity bias, also known as similarity bias, is the tendency people have to connect with others who share similar interests, experiences and backgrounds.\n\nWhen companies hire for “culture fit,” they are likely falling prey to affinity bias. When hiring teams meet someone they like and who they know will get along with the team, it’s more often than not because that person shares similar interests, experiences and backgrounds, which is not helping your team grow and diversify. While similarities shouldn’t automatically disqualify a candidate, they should never be the deciding factor, either.\n\nHow to Avoid Affinity Bias\n\nTo avoid affinity bias, actively take note of the similarities you share with the candidate so that you can differentiate between attributes that may cloud your judgment and the concrete skills, experiences and unique qualities that would contribute to your team as a “culture add” rather than “culture fit.”\n\n2. Ageism\n\nAgeism in the workplace is the tendency to have negative feelings about another person based on their age.\n\nAgeism affects older people more often than younger people. About two-thirds of workers aged 50 and over believe older employees face discrimination because of their age. The later employees are in their careers, the more difficult it is to change careers, find a job or move up in their careers because employers tend to value younger talent — even though experience and expertise are critical skills for any successful business.\n\nHow to Avoid Ageism\n\nTo avoid ageism in the workplace, train your team members to understand the issue of ageism and debunk some of the myths about workers of different ages. Your company should also create a policy that prevents age bias along with hiring goals to keep age diversity top of mind when recruiting new talent.\n\n3. Anchor Bias\n\nAnchor bias, or expectation anchor bias, is when someone holds onto an initial, singular piece of information to make decisions.\n\nAnchor bias commonly occurs in the hiring process while comparing candidates. A recruiter may see one aspect of a candidate and then cannot “unsee” that characteristic while considering other applicants. For example, the first applicant a recruiter considers may request a significantly lower salary than the following candidates. This can create an expectation anchor bias that the latter candidates are asking for too much.\n\nHow to Avoid Anchor Bias\n\nTo avoid anchor bias, try to compare every aspect of a candidate and never rely on one singular piece of information as a deciding factor. If you find yourself coming back to one piece of information you’re comparing against, try omitting that anchoring piece of information and comparing candidates based on their other characteristics and qualifications.\n\n4. Attribution Bias\n\nAttribution bias is a phenomenon where you try to make sense of or judge a person’s behavior based on prior observations and interactions you’ve had with that individual that make up your perception of them.\n\nWhile this may seem harmless, humans are quick to judge and falsely assume things about a person without knowing their full story. When hiring, attribution bias can cause hiring managers and recruiters to determine a candidate unfit for the job because of something unusual on their resume or unexpected behavior during the interview.\n\nHow to Avoid Attribution Bias\n\nRather than assume a candidate is unfit for a job because they were late to the interview, ask them what happened — it could be totally innocent and unprecedented. If there is something on their resume or something they said during the interview that caused you to draw conclusions about the candidate, ask them further clarifying questions. Don’t forget that interviewees are often nervous and may misspeak or stumble. Give them a chance to share their full story with you before you judge.\n\n5. Authority Bias\n\nAuthority bias refers to when an idea or opinion is given more attention or thought to be more accurate because it was provided by an authority figure.\n\nAuthority bias is very easy to find in the workplace because hierarchies are already in place. Existing hierarchies make it incredibly easy to simply follow the leader, even if the leader’s ideas aren’t what is best for the company or their employees. But putting too much trust and power in leadership roles can limit employee engagement, hinder employees’ professional growth and ultimately damage a company’s ability to innovate.\n\nHow to Avoid Authority Bias\n\nAvoiding authority bias can be difficult depending on the culture of a workplace. One of the best ways to avoid this bias is to foster an environment of ideas, where others speak up and voice their own opinions and ideas.\n\n6. Beauty Bias\n\nBeauty bias is a social behavior where people believe that those they perceive as attractive are more successful, competent and qualified.\n\nWhile appearance (race aside) is not protected by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, it is a form of bias that is prominent in the workplace. Many people connect conventional beauty to higher levels of intelligence, social skills and physical health. Workers considered physically attractive can go on to earn up to 15 percent more than workers considered less physically attractive. At the same time, candidates considered physically attractive may also be discriminated against by hiring teams due to perceived entitlement.\n\nHow to Avoid Beauty Bias\n\nTo avoid beauty bias, companies should create structured recruiting and interview processes so that your team will be able to compare applications and interviews equally and reduce the risk of bias. Phone screenings (as opposed to video calls) and unbiased technologies can also help teams identify top candidates.\n\n7. Confirmation Bias\n\nConfirmation bias is the inclination to draw conclusions about a situation or person based on your personal desires, beliefs and prejudices rather than on unbiased merit.\n\nIn hiring, confirmation bias often plays a detrimental role at the very beginning of the process when you first review a resume and form an initial opinion of the candidate based on inconsequential attributes like their name, where they’re from, where they went to school and so forth. This opinion can follow you into the interview process and consequently steer questions to confirm the initial opinion of the candidate.\n\nHow to Avoid Confirmation Bias\n\nWhile every interview will lend itself to a unique conversation based on the individual’s background, it’s important to ask standardized, skills-based questions that provide each candidate with a fair chance to stand out. This will help prevent your team from asking too many off-the-cuff questions that may lead to confirmation bias.\n\n8. Conformity Bias\n\nConformity bias, more commonly known as peer pressure, is the tendency people have to act similar to the people around them regardless of their own personal beliefs or idiosyncrasies.\n\nWhen your hiring team gets together to review a candidate’s application materials and conduct the interview, conformity bias can cause individuals to sway their opinion of a candidate to match the opinion of the majority. The problem is the majority is not always right, which may cause your team to miss out on an excellent candidate because individual opinions become muddled in a group setting.\n\nHow to Avoid Conformity Bias\n\nBefore you get your hiring team together to review a candidate, have them all write down and submit their individual opinions separate from one another immediately after the interview ends. Then have your team come together and review what everyone wrote down so you can hear their impartial opinions and avoid conformity bias in the process.\n\n9. Contrast Effect\n\nThe contrast effect is when you compare two or more things that you have come into contact with — either simultaneously or one after another — causing you to exaggerate the performance of one in contrast to the other.\n\nThis one is a bit of a mind-bender, but it’s also one of the most common types of bias in the recruiting industry. When you’re reviewing loads of candidates, it can be easy to compare one application to the next in the stack and determine which one is better than the other. An exceptionally good interview with one candidate may make the next one seem terrible.\n\nHow to Avoid the Contrast Effect\n\nTo avoid the contrast effect, create a structured applicant review and interview process so that your team will be able to compare applications and interview answers as apples-to-apples rather than apples-to-oranges. This also goes for performance reviews and rewards for individual employees.\n\n10. Gender Bias\n\nGender bias is the tendency to prefer one gender over another gender.\n\nToo often men are given preferential treatment over women in the workplace. According to Lean In’s Women in the Workplace study, women only occupy about 25 percent of C-suite executive positions, and for every 100 men promoted from entry-level to manager roles, only 87 women are promoted.\n\nHow to Avoid Gender Bias\n\nAvoid gender bias by conducting anonymous screenings of applications that exclude aspects of a candidate that may reveal their assumed gender, like name and interests. Set diversity hiring goals to ensure your company holds itself accountable to equitable hiring practices. And again, make sure to compare candidates based on skill and merit rather than traits that can cloud your judgment of them.\n\n11. Halo Effect\n\nThe halo effect is the tendency people have to place another person on a pedestal after learning something impressive about them.\n\nThe halo effect can come into play at any stage of the hiring process. You may see a candidate worked at a highly regarded company or graduated from an elite school, but if there’s anything we’ve learned about the 2019 college admissions scandal, it’s to not judge a candidate on the merit of their name-brand education.\n\nHow to Avoid the Halo Effect\n\nThe halo effect can be dangerously blinding when it comes to reviewing candidates, but it can be avoided. When reviewing a stack of applications, you are probably looking for something unique that makes a candidate stand out from the rest. When you do this, also consider the candidate without that one gleaming attribute and see how their experiences, skills and personalities compare to other candidates who may not have had the same privileges or opportunities.\n\n12. Height Bias\n\nHeight bias or heightism is the tendency to judge a person who is significantly short or tall.\n\nThis may seem a bit far-fetched, but one study found that one’s annual earnings can increase up to 13 percent with an additional centimeter in height. Another study found that tall candidates are perceived as more competent, employable and healthy, which may explain why 58 percent of male CEOs at major companies are over six feet tall.\n\nHow to Avoid Height Bias\n\nConducting anonymous interviews, phone interviews or video interviews will reduce your susceptibility to judge a person based on their height. Also, simply knowing that this bias is a common social behavior will help you identify your bias against candidates.\n\n13. Horn Effect\n\nThe horn effect is the tendency people have to view another person negatively after learning something unpleasant or negative about them.\n\nThe direct opposite of the halo effect, the horn effect can cause hiring teams to weed out candidates based on a trait that is averse to the team’s preferences. This could be something as trivial as the candidate working with a company you personally dislike or the candidate displaying a particular quirk or mannerism during the interview. Such traits may alter your perception of the candidate entirely even though it’s a small factor that may not even be relevant.\n\nHow to Avoid the Horn Effect\n\nIf you have a negative feeling about a candidate, take the time to figure out exactly where that gut feeling is coming from. It may be something superficial or insignificant that shouldn’t affect their chance at the role. You may also want to check with the rest of the interviewing team to understand the root of their opinions and preferences about a candidate.\n\n14. Name Bias\n\nName bias is the tendency people have to judge and prefer people with certain types of names — typically names that are of Anglo origin.\n\nThis is one of the most pervasive examples of unconscious bias in the hiring process, and the numbers bear it out.One study found that white names receive significantly more callbacks for interviews than Black names. Another study found that Asian last names are 28 percent less likely to receive a callback for an interview compared to Anglo last names.\n\nHow to Avoid Name Bias\n\nName bias can be avoided if you omit the candidate’s name and personal information — like email, phone number and address — from their application materials. You can either do this by assigning candidates a number or have an unbiased third-party team member omit this information for the hiring team until they bring a candidate in to interview. This will ensure that hiring teams are selecting candidates based on their skills and experiences without the influence of irrelevant personal information.\n\n15. Nonverbal Bias\n\nNonverbal bias is analyzing nonverbal communication attributes such as body language and letting it affect a decision or opinion.\n\nWhen you meet a candidate for an interview, nonverbal bias can creep in. Whether it’s a weak handshake, folded arms or difficulty holding eye contact, it’s easy to take these cues as disinterest, overconfidence or an overall negative attitude. It’s important to remember that the way a person moves through the world is not indicative of their true intentions or whether they will be a successful addition to your team or not.\n\nHow to Avoid Nonverbal Bias\n\nRemember that everyone is different — this includes their mannerisms and ways of communicating physically. For example, if a candidate keeps their arms crossed in an interview, perhaps it’s simply a nervous response. You can teach someone to uncross their arms, but that doesn’t mean they will bring the necessary skills to their position.\n\n16. Overconfidence Bias\n\nThe overconfidence bias refers to a person’s tendency to be more confident in their capabilities than they should be.\n\nOverconfidence bias may not lead to the kinds of hiring and recruiting issues other biases cause, but it can create conflict within an organization and cause a company to not live up to its potential. When overconfidence bias is allowed to flow freely, companies or employees with this bias do not believe they need to make improvements, thus affecting their own growth as well as the company’s growth.\n\nHow to Avoid Overconfidence Bias\n\nOne way to avoid overconfidence bias is to continue your work on affinity bias and hire a diverse team that doesn’t fall into the groupthink trap. It will be more difficult for overconfidence to take over if you foster a diverse and challenging environment.\n\n17. Status Quo Bias\n\nStatus quo bias is a preference for things to remain the way they are and a resistance to change.\n\nFor example, employees who are used to working with a specific software platform may object to the company’s decision to implement a more advanced platform with simpler workflows. If companies don’t establish a culture that accepts change, it only becomes harder to adopt new technologies and stay ahead of the competition.\n\nHow to Avoid Status Quo Bias\n\nDeveloping a culture of innovation can help you avoid status quo bias. In this environment, employees can feel more comfortable experimenting with different ideas and new tools and workflows. If larger organizational changes are occurring, company leaders can emphasize the benefits of the change to frame it in a more positive way for employees.\n\n18. Illusory Correlation\n\nIllusory correlation refers to thinking there’s a connection between two variables when there’s no evidence to back up this claim.\n\nThis kind of bias can go hand-in-hand with stereotyping employees in the workplace. For example, say a manager has a negative experience with an employee of a particular ethnic background. That manager may then make an illusory correlation and falsely assume they’ll have a negative experience with employees of the same ethnic background.\n\nHow to Avoid Illusory Correlation\n\nEducate employees on this type of bias and how it can fuel false assumptions. DEI and bias training focused on stereotypes can be an effective method to help workers become more aware of this bias.\n\nHow to Reduce and Prevent Unconscious Bias\n\nTo seriously address unconscious biases, commit to some long-term strategies. The following ideas enable businesses to cultivate more welcoming workplaces that a wider range of candidates will want to join.\n\n1. Unconscious Bias Training\n\nEducation is an important step in becoming more aware of unconscious biases. Conduct unconscious bias training programs to teach employees how factors like language can alienate candidates and coworkers. Training sessions are also an excellent opportunity to set expectations for how leaders should enforce diverse, equitable and inclusive practices going forward.\n\n2. Diversity Hiring Goals\n\nSeek out diverse sources of talent by opening up positions to remote candidates, which broadens the candidate pool to include people of varying life experiences, and targeting historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs).\n\n3. Talent Assessments and Candidate Scorecards\n\nDevelop objective interview and hiring methods. Talent assessments and interview scorecards create a common structure for grading all candidates, which ensures interviews stay the course and don’t dive too deep into candidates’ personal backgrounds.\n\n4. Different Interview Techniques and Formats\n\nDiversify your interview tactics and formats to make your interview process less prone to bias. Phone interviews are a great way to prevent beauty bias from influencing recruiting decisions. A common set of pre-interview questions is another interview technique that creates a more standard, less biased interview setup.\n\n5. Diverse and Inclusive Culture\n\nAddressing unconscious biases is just one of the many DEI initiatives companies should be investing in. Leaders should collaborate with HR to develop guidelines and policies that serve as the foundation for a diverse and inclusive culture. This is a more holistic approach that proves DEI is a permanent part of a company’s identity, not just a catchphrase.\n\nImportance of Addressing Unconscious Biases\n\nAcknowledging and resolving unconscious biases can help improve many aspects of an organization, from recruiting to retention.\n\nStronger Recruiting\n\nAccording to a 2023 Pew Research survey, 78 percent of Black workers and 61 percent of workers who are women believe focusing on DEI in the workplace is a good thing. If a company has a good track record when it comes to DEI initiatives, job seekers of marginalized groups may want to join.\n\nMore Career Advancement\n\nFor every 100 men promoted from an entry-level position to a manager role, 87 women received a promotion, and this number falls to 73 for women of color. Giving employees of various backgrounds the support they need to thrive in the workplace may lead them to stick around longer.\n\nInnovation and Productivity\n\nA 2023 McKinsey report found that companies with the most women representation and ethnic diversity were 39 percent more likely to outperform companies with the least women representation and ethnic diversity. Diverse teams often display a range of perspectives, leading to the exchange of more ideas and creative solutions that give a business a competitive edge.\n\nHealthy Work Environment\n\nLetting unconscious biases fester can lead to outright discrimination and create a hostile workplace, potentially pushing employees of marginalized identities out of the company. By contrast, a healthy work environment is one where workers have awareness of — and ultimately address — their unconscious biases.\n\nIncreased Employee Engagement\n\nA bias-filled workplace can become a toxic workplace, where employees are exposed to bullying and harassment. This can have devastating consequences for employees’ mental health. Companies that take steps to address unconscious biases can protect employees and show them they’re appreciated. In return, employees will feel more motivated to work hard, contributing to higher levels of employee engagement.\n\nImproved Retention\n\nIf company leadership lets unconscious biases drive harmful behavior, employees may decide a change of scenery is needed. A 2023 INTOO study found that over a third of workers would take a pay cut to leave a toxic work environment for a less toxic one. Organizations that proactively tackle unconscious biases and negative actions can cultivate safer and more positive work environments, making it easier to retain employees.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

      "# [AI in Healthcare: Uses, Examples & Benefits by Sam Daley on 2022-06-10](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-healthcare)\nArtificial intelligence simplifies the lives of patients, doctors and hospital administrators by performing tasks that are typically done by humans, but in less time and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nAI in healthcare shows up in a number of ways, such as finding new links between genetic codes, powering surgery-assisting robots, automating administrative tasks, personalizing treatment options and much more.\n\nPut simply, AI is reinventing — and reinvigorating — modern healthcare through machines that can predict, comprehend, learn and act.\n\nWhat Is AI in Healthcare?\n\nAI in healthcare refers to the use of machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning and other AI technologies to enhance the experiences of both healthcare professionals and patients. The data-processing and predictive capabilities of AI enable health professionals to better manage their resources and take a more proactive approach to various aspects of healthcare.\n\nWith these technologies, doctors can then make quicker and more accurate diagnoses, health administrators can locate electronic health records faster and patients can receive more timely and personalized treatments.\n\nExamples of AI in Healthcare\n\nTo give you a better understanding of the rapidly evolving field, we rounded up some examples and use cases of AI in healthcare.\n\nAI in Medical Diagnosis\n\nEvery year, roughly 400,000 hospitalized patients suffer preventable harm, with 100,000 deaths. In light of that, the promise of improving the diagnostic process is one of AI’s most exciting healthcare applications. Incomplete medical histories and large caseloads can lead to deadly human errors. Immune to those variables, AI can predict and diagnose disease at a faster rate than most medical professionals.\n\nAI in Drug Discovery\n\nThe drug development industry is bogged down by skyrocketing development costs and research that takes thousands of human hours. Putting each drug through clinical trials costs an estimated average of $1.3 billion, and only 10 percent of those drugs are successfully brought to market. Due to breakthroughs in technology, AI is speeding up this process by helping design drugs, predicting any side effects and identifying ideal candidates for clinical trials.\n\nAI in Patient Experience\n\nAI can be used to support digital communications, offering schedule reminders, tailored health tips and suggested next steps to patients. The ability of AI to aid in health diagnoses also improves the speed and accuracy of patient visits, leading to faster and more personalized care. And efficiently providing a seamless patient experience allows hospitals, clinics and physicians to treat more patients on a daily basis.\n\nAI in Healthcare Data Management\n\nHighly valuable information can sometimes get lost among the forest of trillions of data points. Additionally, the inability to connect important data points slows the development of new drugs, preventative medicine and proper diagnosis. Because of its ability to handle massive volumes of data, AI breaks down data silos and connects in minutes information that used to take years to process. This can reduce the time and costs of healthcare administrative processes, contributing to more efficient daily operations and patient experiences.\n\nAI in Robotic Surgery\n\nHospitals use AI and robots to help with everything from minimally invasive procedures to open heart surgery. Surgeons can control a robot’s mechanical arms while seated at a computer console as the robot gives the doctor a three-dimensional, magnified view of the surgical site. The surgeon then leads other team members who work closely with the robot through the entire operation. Robot-assisted surgeries have led to fewer surgery-related complications, less pain and a quicker recovery time.\n\nCompanies Using AI in Healthcare\n\nThese are some of the companies paving the way for healthcare innovation by applying AI technology.\n\nLocation: New York, New York\n\nEliseAI specializes in conversational AI solutions.

      "# [What Does Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Mean in the Workplace? by Kate Heinz on 2023-02-08](https://builtin.com/diversity-inclusion/what-does-dei-mean-in-the-workplace)\nDiversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) refers to practices and policies intended to support people who come from varying backgrounds and give them the resources they need to thrive in the workplace. DEI frameworks take into account factors like race, gender and sexual orientation, so teams can find ways to help employees from marginalized groups succeed.\n\nWhat Is Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)?\n\nDEI (sometimes referred to DE&I or IE&D) stands for diversity, equity and inclusion. As a discipline, DEI is any policy or set of initiatives designed to make people of various backgrounds feel welcome and ensure they have support to perform to the fullest of their abilities in the workplace.\n\n“We as employers need to make sure we’re including these individuals and that we’re giving them equity,” said Catalina Colman, former director of HR and inclusion at Built In. “We need to make sure that, not only do they have a job, but they have the same ability to get promoted, to contribute and have the same impact — in the world and in the workplace — as their peers.”\n\nThis kind of environment is created by following all three aspects of DEI:\n\nDiversity\n\nDiversity is the presence of differences within a given setting. In the workplace, that can mean differences in race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age and socioeconomic class. It can also refer to differences in physical ability, veteran status, whether or not you have kids — all of those are components of diversity.\n\nWhy Diversity Matters\n\nDiversity in the workplace is important because with different backgrounds come different points of view, which ultimately leads to better ideas and solutions.\n\n“From a business standpoint, different perspectives directly influence a product — how it’s made, who it serves, how it functions and so on,” Colman said. “More perspectives make for a better product.” People from different backgrounds with varying life experiences will be able to provide new perspectives that help refine and enhance processes.\n\n“The more diverse voices there are in your organization, the better your outcomes will be, purely from a business standpoint,” Colman said.\n\nEven so, Colman urges employers to look beyond the business case: “I believe that if we give people the equitable opportunity to not only be employed, but to have employment with purpose and passion, our society can and will do great things. It’s a measurable good for everyone.”\n\nEquity\n\nEquity is the process of ensuring that practices and programs are impartial, fair and provide equal possible outcomes for every individual.\n\nWhy Equity Matters\n\nIn order to ensure equal circumstances for all individuals across the organization, equity requires that employers recognize barriers and advantages. This is the crucial difference between “equity” and “equality.”\n\n“Equity takes into account the fact that not everybody is starting at the same level,” explained Colman. “Take home ownership, for example. A bank can make the statement that the loan application process is equal and that they will not discriminate based on race, gender or ethnicity. That doesn’t take into account student loans, familial debt, socioeconomic status.”\n\nThese limitations are what define barriers and give rise to advantages, ultimately leading to an inequitable process. Inequity permeates every aspect of your business, requiring vigilance and swift action. “You’re not going to be able to build diversity if you’re not taking the steps to be more equitable,” Colman said.\n\nCompanies that establish equitable environments not only support diverse workforces, but also incentivize employees to invest more energy and passion into their positions. “Equity is why we go to work,” explained Colman. “We want to get compensated fairly for our work, we want to be challenged, to learn and to contribute. People often choose an employer based on those things, which boil down to equity.”\n\nInclusion\n\nInclusion is the practice of ensuring that people feel a sense of belonging in the workplace. This means that every employee feels comfortable and supported by the organization when it comes to being their authentic selves.\n\nWhy Inclusion Matters\n\nWhile the workplace does require professionalism and etiquette, an inclusive culture should not bar individuals from being themselves.\n\n“Employees should not worry about code-switching or shielding part of their identity,” Colman said. “They should be able to walk through the door without feeling like something about them has to change.”\n\nInclusion is what maintains diversity. Without it, employees will simply leave the organization. “If a candidate walks into a workplace and they’re the only woman or BIPOC employee, they’re going to question the employer’s authenticity and values,” Colman said.\n\n“People want to belong, plain and simple,” she added. “And marginalized individuals want to know that they’re not going to be the token person to represent a demographic. They shouldn’t have to worry about that in the workplace; they should be focused on how they’re going to have an impact within the company.”\n\nWhy DEI Is Important: Benefits of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nDEI is vital to creating and maintaining a successful workplace, one founded on the principle that all people can thrive personally and professionally. Bringing together people of various backgrounds leads to new and creative ideas. More importantly, a DEI strategy contributes to a space where all employees feel they have intrinsic worth, not in spite of their differences but because of their differences.\n\nBelow are a few more benefits businesses can enjoy upon embracing a DEI approach.\n\n1. Strengthened Recruitment\n\nDEI has grown in popularity among candidates and employees. In fact, three-fourths of job seekers and employees treat DEI as a major factor when weighing job offers and companies. Candidates recognize the positive effects of an environment that welcomes a range of backgrounds and want to join this kind of space.\n\nHowever, employees aren’t the only ones who should be pushing for more diverse and inclusive cultures. Company leaders must also make the effort to implement DEI policies, and there are plenty of incentives for businesses to get started as soon as possible.\n\n2. Higher Employee Retention\n\nOnce candidates join an organization, DEI can also play a role in convincing them to stick around. Feelings of inclusion make up as much as 35 percent of an employee’s emotional connection to their work and 20 percent of their wanting to remain with their current employer. Companies that take steps to cultivate a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace can then reduce employee turnover and enjoy a more stable workforce through the years.\n\n3. More Innovation\n\nA Harvard Business Review survey of 79 large companies found that a 0.1-point increase in a company’s DEI ratings correlates to a 13-percent increase in that company’s ability to change. When companies construct inclusive teams, employees from diverse backgrounds can offer different ideas and perspectives. This makes it easier to solve problems, develop unorthodox approaches and craft creative solutions to help companies adapt on the fly.\n\n4. Deeper Trust\n\nTrust hinges on leadership building genuine relationships with employees, and DEI is a key component of this process. When companies make DEI commitments and don’t follow through, 40 percent of workers would think about leaving and 56 percent would no longer recommend their employer as a place to work.\n\nOrganizations that recruit diverse talent must execute DEI initiatives to make employees of different backgrounds feel respected and safe in the workplace. If businesses neglect their DEI commitments, employees of marginalized backgrounds may believe the company doesn’t care about them and lose the trust they once had in organizational leadership.\n\n5. Improved Business Outcomes\n\nCompanies that listen to DEI advocates’ demands and make changes can benefit from a diverse and inclusive culture as well.\n\nAccording to Forbes, increasing female partners’ shares by 10 percent often leads to a 10 percent rise in revenue. In addition, firms that display culturally and ethnically diverse executive teams are 33 percent more likely to lead their industries in profitability. When people feel welcomed for who they are, they perform at a higher level. It’s a win-win situation for everyone when companies take steps to diversify their workforces.\n\nIf your industry is ever going to be a place where innovation and ingenuity thrive, diversity, equity and inclusion have to take center stage. Employers must actively work to create meaningful change in spite of the history of injustice that has marginalized underrepresented groups within the workplace. This work is often spearheaded by HR departments.\n\nMore on DEIWhat Is Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB)?\n\nHR’s Role in Implementing a DEI Strategy and Culture\n\nFor employers and people management professionals alike, the biggest challenge is knowing where to start.\n\n“There’s no quick fix,” Colman said. “A lot of people immediately jump to figure out how they can make their company more diverse, but you can’t underestimate the importance of inclusion and equity. Without those two pieces, you’re not going to achieve true diversity.”\n\nUnderstanding how each element of DEI builds upon the others is important to creating a work environment that is equitable and inclusive of all individuals. Just like DEI is a multifaceted process, Colman encourages employers to lean on each other.\n\n“It’s not going to be a single HR person that addresses the issue of DEI for a company,” she added. “Lean on your professional community. You’re not going to be able to have all the answers because you don’t have all the perspectives.”\n\nThe focus on DEI has prompted a huge shift for HR. “I think the mindset has always been to avoid talking about these things,” Colman said. “We typically put them in the handbook and address them in training maybe once a year. We didn’t want to make people uncomfortable. I think right now, the call to action is about understanding how to navigate that discomfort and how to use that to elevate your workforce. It’s about doing the important work that is long overdue and becoming inclusive and equitable.”\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",
      "# [The True Costs of Employee Turnover by Kate Heinz on 2022-01-12](https://builtin.com/recruiting/cost-of-turnover)\nHigh employee turnover can have a big impact on your organization’s bottom line. But more than that, it’s a sign that your company is not empowering your team to show up to work each day. Tackling high turnover should be about more than just saving money — it should also be about helping your company reach its full potential. That all comes down to building trust and rapport with your employees.\n\nRead on to learn the true cost of employee turnover — and how to reduce it.\n\nWhat Is Employee Turnover?\n\nEmployee turnover is the percentage of employees that leave a company over a given period of time. It’s closely related to employee retention rate, though the two are not always the inverse of each other. Turnover may be a part of business, but high turnover is largely indicative of deeper issues.\n\nTurnover is split into two categories: voluntary and involuntary. Voluntary turnover refers to an employee’s decision to leave the organization, whereas involuntary turnover occurs when an employee is terminated by the employer. Ideally, you’re only hiring people you want to keep around, so involuntary turnover is kept to a minimum. Voluntary turnover, on the other hand, is more difficult to control and has unforeseen consequences that can be harmful to a business.\n\nThe True Cost of Employee Turnover\n\nThe costs of turnover are extremely high: it’s estimated that losing an employee can cost a company one-half to two times the employee’s salary. Depending on the individual’s level of seniority, the financial burden fluctuates. For hourly workers, it costs an average of $1,500 per employee. For technical positions, the cost jumps to 100 to 150 percent of salary. At the high end, C-suite turnover can cost 213 percent of salary.\n\nNichole Viviani, chief people officer at Xplor Technologies, notes that some of the obvious costs of turnover include ad spending for newly open positions and the extra time commitment of training new employees – but that isn’t the whole picture.\n\n“There’s the less visible, but equally impactful, costs,” she said. “Things like missed or delayed revenue, or the risk of losing long-standing customers when customer-facing colleagues leave.”\n\nNot only are you forced to dedicate time and resources to recruiting, onboarding and training a new hire after an employee leaves; your business simultaneously takes a hit internally while the role remains unfilled. These expenses are known as the cost per hire and cost of vacancy, respectively. It’s estimated that two thirds of all sunk costs due to turnover are intangible, including lost productivity and knowledge, which are part of the cost-of-vacancy calculation.\n\n“It takes a while for new employees to ramp and fully onboard into a new role and a new company,” said Shirley Grill-Rachman, COO of Skai. “Turnover can have dual implications of opportunity cost, while that role is backfilled, [and] the cost of that ramp time for a replacement hire.”\n\nHowever, the most substantial impact of turnover is not a financial cost, but the damage done to your remaining team. Your people are absolutely essential to your business’s success. Without them, current employees need to take on additional responsibilities, and your company may have to abandon or postpone plans to scale. In short, a high turnover rate cuts much deeper than meets the eye, but these are some of the factors you should be aware of.\n\nLost Productivity\n\nWhen an employee leaves, their workload has to go somewhere. Either projects are halted altogether while the role remains vacant, or colleagues are forced to pick up the slack and spread themselves thin across multiple roles.\n\n“When talented and knowledgeable employees leave, you run the risk of missing targets and seeing a negative impact on customer service while a replacement is recruited and trained,” Viviani said.\n\nStalled projects lead to delayed releases and lost revenue, so a reduction in turnover can spell the difference between meeting your quarterly goals or missing them entirely.\n\nDepleted Employee Morale\n\nA team member’s departure can be a significant blow to employee morale, as losing a friend and colleague leaves a hole in the team dynamic. On top of that, employees may begin to look for problems; if someone they trust and respect decided to leave, should they consider it, too?\n\n“For some employees, [losing a teammate] leads to frustration, resentment and burnout, and can prompt them to question whether they, too, should be looking for a new opportunity,” said Viviani.\n\nDiminished Employer Brand\n\nThe reputation of being a revolving-door employer won’t attract job seekers. If anything, your open roles will draw in low-quality candidates — individuals who aren’t interested in a long-term position or who don’t care about making a significant impact. These employees can demotivate others and drive more new hires out the door shortly after they arrive.\n\nMore Turnover\n\nTurnover is cyclical. As mentioned above, an employee’s departure impacts the company culture and the workload of their teammates. Overworked, unengaged employees are more susceptible to burnout which generally leads to additional turnover. Regardless of industry and company, some turnover will always be par for the course, but preventing subsequent employee separations is crucial.\n\n“For better or worse, turnover tends to happen in waves,” said Grill-Rachman. “Obviously, when one of those waves hits, morale can be impacted as more employees reevaluate their individual relationships to their workplaces.”\n\nRelated38 Employee Turnover Statistics to Know\n\nHow to Calculate Employee Turnover Rate\n\nTo calculate employee turnover rate, you’ll need to know, within a given time period, the number of employee separations and the average number of employees present. The average number of employees can be determined by adding together the number of employees on the first day and the last day of the time period, then dividing that sum total by two.\n\nThen, plug the above values into the following turnover rate formula:\n\nTurnover rate = [(# of employee separations) / (average # of employees)] x 100\n\nFactors of High Employee Turnover\n\nIn order to evaluate the true cost of turnover at your company, you need to understand the aspects of your business that are likely contributing to your high rate of turnover. In extremely volatile times, the factors of turnover are exacerbated. Especially then, the following common causes of turnover cannot be overlooked.\n\nCompany Culture\n\nEmployees can recognize a toxic company culture from a mile away, and they won’t be loyal to an employer that neglects to make improvements. In addition to role responsibilities, organizational culture is the bedrock of the employee experience. In fact, 34 percent of new hires who quit within the first 90 days from a job do so because of company culture not meeting expectations.\n\n“While some periods of turnover are natural, chronically high turnover can be symptomatic of a company culture that leadership needs to act quickly to remedy,” Grill-Rachman said.\n\nManagers and Leadership\n\nManagers interact with their direct reports regularly, so it makes sense that they have a significant impact on employees’ overall engagement.\n\n“In today’s work environment, managers are the biggest drivers of culture,” Grill-Rachman said. “Employees have expectations of their managers, and they are rightfully more scrutinized for the kind of environments they create.”\n\nIn order for a business to be successful, every member of the team must have confidence in the leadership team and feel valued. Otherwise, employees will look elsewhere.\n\nLack of Growth Opportunities\n\nA career plateau is a driving force of voluntary employee turnover. It’s widely understood that professional growth is not limited to upward mobility. However, if there aren’t opportunities for continual learning or employee development, you’ll quickly lose top performers who are eager to advance. Of employees looking to quit, 66 percent cite a lack of career advancement opportunities as their reason for leaving.\n\n“Leaders are contributing to high turnover when they’re doing things like not helping employees play to their strengths, or not providing regular feedback and development opportunities,” said Viviani.\n\nOne-Way Communication\n\nEmployees want (and deserve) to have their voices heard. Two-way communication between team members and senior leaders is vital to creating a positive work culture. A lack of transparency when it comes to company performance and team strategy can cause employees to lose faith in their leaders and question whether their ideas are taken into consideration.\n\nNeglecting to ask employees for their ideas and opinions will drive them to look for a new company; companies implementing regular employee feedback see 14.9 percent lower turnover rates.\n\nLack of Employee Recognition\n\nFailing to recognize employee achievements and celebrate successes will make your people feel undervalued. If they believe that their contributions to the company aren’t appreciated, they’ll begin to disengage from their work and seek employment elsewhere. Research shows that companies that have formal employee recognition programs see 31 percent less voluntary turnover than companies without.\n\nHow to Reduce Employee Turnover\n\nThe good news: turnover is preventable. One thing to keep in mind when striving to reduce employee turnover is that the little things at a company matter, and can result in a significant uptick in engagement. And as we know, engaged employees stick around.\n\nUse these following tips as a guide for how to improve retention.\n\n1. Recognize Employees\n\nImplementing an employee recognition program is a low-lift strategy to increase engagement and reduce turnover, as employees who feel more appreciated by employers are less likely to leave. Recognition can be seamlessly integrated into feedback sessions between managers and their direct reports.\n\nStill, go above and beyond by establishing a formal employee recognition program complete with employee spotlights and peer-to-peer recognition opportunities. Leverage your communication platforms to encourage employees to give shoutouts to and thank their colleagues for a job well done. Rewards are another great way to recognize employees for their accomplishments, and they don’t have to be limited solely to monetary prizes.\n\n2. Establish a Feedback Process\n\nAssuming employees are engaged and happy is the first mistake most employers make. Give your people the opportunity to raise concerns and address issues before they become deal-breakers.\n\n“Don’t only focus on ‘flight risks’ but rather, keep a pulse check on how your current employees are feeling by setting up a check-in on a regular basis,” Grill-Rachman said.\n\nThanks to software developments, it’s never been easier to implement regular employee engagement surveys for collecting anonymous feedback. Conduct stay interviews to keep tabs on what keeps great employees around. You can further automate your feedback process by implementing one of these top employee engagement tools.\n\n3. Promote Your Core Values\n\nCore values are the backbone of a strong company culture. When done correctly, core values guide business decisions, give purpose to your mission statement and inform how employees interact with one another. Furthermore, having an agreed-upon, public-facing list of core values ensures you hire the right people and continue to cultivate a positive work culture as your business scales.\n\nTake the time to carefully consider your list of core values. Engage the leadership team, members of the HR department and some of your most-tenured employees to be a part of the conversation. Keep your list of values concise so as to be intentional and actionable. Once the list is finalized, instruct your team in the new core values and make value training a part of your onboarding process.\n\n4. Implement Your Company Mission\n\nIn addition to being able to see the impact of their own work on the organization’s success, employees want to work for a company that’s making a difference. Finalize your company mission so every individual is working toward a common goal beyond just profit margins.\n\n“Understand what motivates your people, and how to get the best out of them,” said Viviani. “Show your people the future they can have with your company by expanding their skills and experiences while staying with you.”\n\n5. Enhance Your Benefits Package\n\nThe benefits and perks you offer are an integral part of your employee value proposition (EVP) and a direct reflection of your company culture.\n\n“While it’s true that many companies are offering sky-high salaries and bonuses to win talent, that won’t keep them in the long run,” Grill-Rachman said. “Invest in your employees, not just new hires, by providing perks programs, strong healthcare benefits and generous PTO.”\n\nUse information collected during exit and stay interviews to refine your employer offerings with benefits that employees want. Showing you care about your people as human beings, not just employees, will help you earn their trust and respect as an empathetic employer. This reputation will also help you attract and retain great talent; 88 percent of employees feel that empathetic leadership creates loyalty among employees toward their company.\n\n6. Conduct Exit Interviews\n\nOne of the most effective, yet frequently overlooked, solutions to turnover is an exit interview process. Don’t squander the opportunity to learn from your mistakes as an employer by dismissing a great employee without asking them where you went wrong. When they’re headed out the door, employees are more likely to be candid about their grievances and provide honest feedback.

      "# [The Future of AI: How AI Is Changing the World by Mike Thomas on 2022-08-10](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-future)\nInnovations in the field of artificial intelligence continue to shape the future of humanity across nearly every industry. AI is already the main driver of emerging technologies like big data, robotics and IoT, and generative AI has further expanded the possibilities and popularity of AI.\n\nAccording to a 2023 IBM survey, 42 percent of enterprise-scale businesses integrated AI into their operations, and 40 percent are considering AI for their organizations. In addition, 38 percent of organizations have implemented generative AI into their workflows while 42 percent are considering doing so.\n\nWith so many changes coming at such a rapid pace, here’s what shifts in AI could mean for various industries and society at large.\n\nMore on the Future of AICan AI Make Art More Human?\n\nThe Evolution of AI\n\nAI has come a long way since 1951, when the first documented success of an AI computer program was written by Christopher Strachey, whose checkers program completed a whole game on the Ferranti Mark I computer at the University of Manchester. Thanks to developments in machine learning and deep learning, IBM’s Deep Blue defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, and the company’s IBM Watson won Jeopardy! in 2011.\n\nSince then, generative AI has spearheaded the latest chapter in AI’s evolution, with OpenAI releasing its first GPT models in 2018. This has culminated in OpenAI developing its GPT-4 model and ChatGPT, leading to a proliferation of AI generators that can process queries to produce relevant text, audio, images and other types of content.\n\nAI has also been used to help sequence RNA for vaccines and model human speech, technologies that rely on model- and algorithm-based machine learning and increasingly focus on perception, reasoning and generalization.\n\nHow AI Will Impact the Future\n\nImproved Business Automation\n\nAbout 55 percent of organizations have adopted AI to varying degrees, suggesting increased automation for many businesses in the near future. With the rise of chatbots and digital assistants, companies can rely on AI to handle simple conversations with customers and answer basic queries from employees.\n\nAI’s ability to analyze massive amounts of data and convert its findings into convenient visual formats can also accelerate the decision-making process. Company leaders don’t have to spend time parsing through the data themselves, instead using instant insights to make informed decisions.\n\n“If [developers] understand what the technology is capable of and they understand the domain very well, they start to make connections and say, ‘Maybe this is an AI problem, maybe that’s an AI problem,’” said Mike Mendelson, a learner experience designer for NVIDIA. “That’s more often the case than, ‘I have a specific problem I want to solve.’”\n\nMore on AI75 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Companies to Know\n\nJob Disruption\n\nBusiness automation has naturally led to fears over job losses. In fact, employees believe almost one-third of their tasks could be performed by AI. Although AI has made gains in the workplace, it’s had an unequal impact on different industries and professions. For example, manual jobs like secretaries are at risk of being automated, but the demand for other jobs like machine learning specialists and information security analysts has risen.\n\nWorkers in more skilled or creative positions are more likely to have their jobs augmented by AI, rather than be replaced. Whether forcing employees to learn new tools or taking over their roles, AI is set to spur upskilling efforts at both the individual and company level.\n\n“One of the absolute prerequisites for AI to be successful in many [areas] is that we invest tremendously in education to retrain people for new jobs,” said Klara Nahrstedt, a computer science professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and director of the school’s Coordinated Science Laboratory.\n\nData Privacy Issues\n\nCompanies require large volumes of data to train the models that power generative AI tools, and this process has come under intense scrutiny. Concerns over companies collecting consumers’ personal data have led the FTC to open an investigation into whether OpenAI has negatively impacted consumers through its data collection methods after the company potentially violated European data protection laws.\n\nIn response, the Biden-Harris administration developed an AI Bill of Rights that lists data privacy as one of its core principles. Although this legislation doesn’t carry much legal weight, it reflects the growing push to prioritize data privacy and compel AI companies to be more transparent and cautious about how they compile training data.\n\nIncreased Regulation\n\nAI could shift the perspective on certain legal questions, depending on how generative AI lawsuits unfold in 2024. For example, the issue of intellectual property has come to the forefront in light of copyright lawsuits filed against OpenAI by writers, musicians and companies like The New York Times. These lawsuits affect how the U.S. legal system interprets what is private and public property, and a loss could spell major setbacks for OpenAI and its competitors.\n\nEthical issues that have surfaced in connection to generative AI have placed more pressure on the U.S. government to take a stronger stance. The Biden-Harris administration has maintained its moderate position with its latest executive order, creating rough guidelines around data privacy, civil liberties, responsible AI and other aspects of AI. However, the government could lean toward stricter regulations, depending on changes in the political climate.\n\nClimate Change Concerns\n\nOn a far grander scale, AI is poised to have a major effect on sustainability, climate change and environmental issues. Optimists can view AI as a way to make supply chains more efficient, carrying out predictive maintenance and other procedures to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nAt the same time, AI could be seen as a key culprit in climate change. The energy and resources required to create and maintain AI models could raise carbon emissions by as much as 80 percent, dealing a devastating blow to any sustainability efforts within tech. Even if AI is applied to climate-conscious technology, the costs of building and training models could leave society in a worse environmental situation than before.\n\nAccelerated Speed of Innovation\n\nIn an essay about the future potential of AI, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei hypothesizes that powerful AI technology could speed up research in the biological sciences as much as tenfold, bringing about a phenomenon he coins “the compressed 21st century,” in which 50 to 100 years of innovation might happen in the span of five to 10 years. This theory builds on the idea that truly revolutionary discoveries are made at a rate of maybe once per year, with the core limitation being a shortage of talented researchers. By increasing the cognitive power devoted to developing hypotheses and testing them out, Amodei suggests, we might close the time gap between important discoveries like the 25-year delay between CRISPR’s discovery in the ‘80s and its application to gene editing.\n\nWhat Industries Will AI Impact the Most?\n\nThere’s virtually no major industry that modern AI hasn’t already affected. Here are a few of the industries undergoing the greatest changes as a result of AI.\n\nAI in Manufacturing\n\nManufacturing has been benefiting from AI for years. With AI-enabled robotic arms and other manufacturing bots dating back to the 1960s and 1970s, the industry has adapted well to the powers of AI. These industrial robots typically work alongside humans to perform a limited range of tasks like assembly and stacking, and predictive analysis sensors keep equipment running smoothly.\n\nAI in Healthcare\n\nIt may seem unlikely, but AI healthcare is already changing the way humans interact with medical providers. Thanks to its big data analysis capabilities, AI helps identify diseases more quickly and accurately, speed up and streamline drug discovery and even monitor patients through virtual nursing assistants.\n\nAI in Finance\n\nBanks, insurers and financial institutions leverage AI for a range of applications like detecting fraud, conducting audits and evaluating customers for loans. Traders have also used machine learning’s ability to assess millions of data points at once, so they can quickly gauge risk and make smart investing decisions.\n\nAI in Education\n\nAI in education will change the way humans of all ages learn. AI’s use of machine learning, natural language processing and facial recognition help digitize textbooks, detect plagiarism and gauge the emotions of students to help determine who’s struggling or bored. Both presently and in the future, AI tailors the experience of learning to student’s individual needs.\n\nAI in Media\n\nJournalism is harnessing AI too, and will continue to benefit from it. One example can be seen in The Associated Press’ use of Automated Insights, which produces thousands of earning reports stories per year. But as generative AI writing tools, such as ChatGPT, enter the market, questions about their use in journalism abound.\n\nAI in Customer Service\n\nMost people dread getting a robocall, but AI in customer service can provide the industry with data-driven tools that bring meaningful insights to both the customer and the provider. AI tools powering the customer service industry come in the form of chatbots and virtual assistants.\n\nAI in Transportation\n\nTransportation is one industry that is certainly teed up to be drastically changed by AI. Self-driving cars and AI travel planners are just a couple of facets of how we get from point A to point B that will be influenced by AI. Even though autonomous vehicles are far from perfect, they will one day ferry us from place to place.\n\nRisks and Dangers of AI\n\nDespite reshaping numerous industries in positive ways, AI still has flaws that leave room for concern. Here are a few potential risks of artificial intelligence.\n\nJob Losses\n\nBetween 2023 and 2028, 44 percent of workers’ skills will be disrupted. Not all workers will be affected equally — women are more likely than men to be exposed to AI in their jobs. Combine this with the fact that there is a gaping AI skills gap between men and women, and women seem much more susceptible to losing their jobs. If companies don’t have steps in place to upskill their workforces, the proliferation of AI could result in higher unemployment and decreased opportunities for those of marginalized backgrounds to break into tech.\n\nHuman Biases\n\nThe reputation of AI has been tainted with a habit of reflecting the biases of the people who train the algorithmic models. For example, facial recognition technology has been known to favor lighter-skinned individuals, discriminating against people of color with darker complexions. If researchers aren’t careful in rooting out these biases early on, AI tools could reinforce these biases in the minds of users and perpetuate social inequalities.\n\nDeepfakes and Misinformation\n\nThe spread of deepfakes threatens to blur the lines between fiction and reality, leading the general public to question what’s real and what isn’t. And if people are unable to identify deepfakes, the impact of misinformation could be dangerous to individuals and entire countries alike. Deepfakes have been used to promote political propaganda, commit financial fraud and place students in compromising positions, among other use cases.\n\nData Privacy\n\nTraining AI models on public data increases the chances of data security breaches that could expose consumers’ personal information. Companies contribute to these risks by adding their own data as well. A 2024 Cisco survey found that 48 percent of businesses have entered non-public company information into generative AI tools and 69 percent are worried these tools could damage their intellectual property and legal rights. A single breach could expose the information of millions of consumers and leave organizations vulnerable as a result.\n\nAutomated Weapons\n\nThe use of AI in automated weapons poses a major threat to countries and their general populations. While automated weapons systems are already deadly, they also fail to discriminate between soldiers and civilians. Letting artificial intelligence fall into the wrong hands could lead to irresponsible use and the deployment of weapons that put larger groups of people at risk.\n\nSuperior Intelligence\n\nNightmare scenarios depict what’s known as the technological singularity, where superintelligent machines take over and permanently alter human existence through enslavement or eradication. Even if AI systems never reach this level, they can become more complex to the point where it’s difficult to determine how AI makes decisions at times. This can lead to a lack of transparency around how to fix algorithms when mistakes or unintended behaviors occur.\n\n“I don’t think the methods we use currently in these areas will lead to machines that decide to kill us,” said Marc Gyongyosi, founder of Onetrack.AI. “I think that maybe five or 10 years from now, I’ll have to reevaluate that statement because we’ll have different methods available and different ways to go about these things.”\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

      "# [3D-Printed Organs: Are We Close? by Brooke Becher on 2023-09-29](https://builtin.com/articles/3d-printed-organs)\n3D-printed organs are replicas of organs produced by a three-dimensional printer or other computer-aided design software. Referencing a digital file, the software program uses biological materials, including human tissue, to construct a 3D-printed organ one layer at a time. The ultimate goal is to supply organs for much-needed transplants and a range of other use cases in the healthcare industry.\n\nWhile this sounds like futuristic technology, 3D-printed organs are actually old news. The first 3D-printed organ that was transplanted into a human was a bladder in 1999 by scientists at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. And it’s still fully functioning more than a couple of decades later.\n\nOther medical milestones — like a woman receiving the world’s first 3D-printed ear implant, or the mobile bioprinters that can print skin directly onto a wound from a patient’s bedside — have made their mark. In addition, a recovering thyroid cancer patient received a 3D-printed windpipe transplant. Although this transplant is biodegradable and will only last five years, it offers further hope for the future of 3D-printed organs.\n\nBelow we cover what 3D-printed organs are, how they work, what they’re made from, their benefits and drawbacks, and what the future holds.\n\nWhat Are 3D-Printed Organs?\n\n3D-printed organs are replicas of organs created by additively manufacturing living human tissues. Additive manufacturing refers to using software and digital files to build a three-dimensional physical object, layer by layer. In this case, layers of human tissue and other biological materials are added one at a time to complete a 3D-printed organ. Despite this being a younger field, the use cases are growing quickly.\n\nWhat Are 3D-Printed Organs Made of?\n\n3D-printed organs are made out of a cellular mixture known as bio-ink. Typically bio-ink consists of cultured cells that are paired with biopolymer hydrogels, like gelatin or alginate, which help construct structures, or scaffold, of an organ and protect living cells during the printing process.\n\nNiina Matthews, a PhD Candidate working out of the Gentile Lab at University of Technology Sydney, explained it like this: Think of a 3D bioprinter as an inkjet printer and bio-ink as the ink inside of a cartridge. Instead of each cartridge being able to produce a different color, though, they extrude biomaterials that can replicate different organs.\n\nWhen creating a bio-ink, researchers must first consider which organ they are trying to artificially replicate. From there, scientists harvest stem cells, or “blank” cells without any specialized function, from the patient. Through a process known as cell differentiation, these cells become specialized to carry out a specific function.\n\n“Since all the organs in the body consist of several cell and tissue types, a specific bio-ink must be developed to suit their exact requirements,” Matthews explained. “Cells organize into different types of tissues, and when tissues are assembled together, the end result is an organ.”\n\nRelated ReadingHow VR and AR Are Used in Surgery: 13 Examples\n\nAre 3D-Printed Organs Available?\n\nCurrently, 3D printing with human tissue is a process that’s secluded to research labs in clinical trials. 3DBio Therapeutics’ clinical trial, for instance, is building ear prosthetics out of the patient’s own cells. The study (currently the only one of its kind) is a promising step for hollow bioprinted structures — like skin, cartilage and bladders — with simple geometry and architecture.\n\n“The ongoing clinical trial will be very helpful to understand what are the different tests that need to be done for new therapies, as there is still no clear regulatory pathway established yet,” said Didarul Bhuiyan, a biomaterial and tissue engineering scientist at West Pharmaceutical Services.\n\nPrinting an ear isn’t the same thing as printing a lung or a heart, though. Bhuiyan said we are “far away” from transplanting complex, life-sized 3D-printed organs into humans, and the general consensus sees this as a reality in about 20 to 30 years.\n\nWhat’s also got researchers excited about 3D-printed organs these days are so-called organoids. Nicknamed “mini-organs,” these are small-scale, functional replicas of naturally occurring body parts made up of self-organizing cells that are produced in vitro.\n\nToday, brains, kidneys and hearts have all been duplicated in petri dishes. The idea is that, one day, we’ll be able to scale them up to regular size and print viable donors on demand.\n\nRelated ReadingStereolithography (SLA): What It Is, How It Works\n\nBenefits of 3D-Printed Organs\n\nAbility to Customize Organs Specific to Patients\n\n3D-printed organs are constructed out of stem cells taken from the patient. Through a process known as cell differentiation, these cells are instructed to carry out very specific tasks in the body, which enables researchers to deliver organ-specific and patient-specific treatments faster and at scale.\n\nShorter Wait Times for Organ Donation\n\nEvery day, 17 people die waiting for an organ transplant. And every eight minutes, another candidate is added to the waiting list. If 3D bioprinting were available en masse, in theory, access to these in-demand organs would be a matter of hours, days or a few weeks versus the current reality of spending years on standby.\n\nReduced Organ Rejection\n\nSince 3D-printed organs are sourced from the patient’s own DNA, the likelihood for a patient’s immune system to recognize a 3D-printed organ as its own rather than a foreign object would theoretically increase. This would result in significantly fewer cases of organ rejection.\n\nLower Healthcare Costs\n\nThe average cost for a kidney transplant (one of the more common transplant procedures), lands at about $442,500 before insurance kicks in. For surgeries that require a longer hospital stay, like hearts, charges skyrocket to $1.6 million. Meanwhile, professional-grade bioprinters used to generate 3D-printed organs and live human tissues are available on the commercial market for as low as $25,000. While this does not include operating and hospital room and board costs, 3-D printed organ transplants could be a cost-effective alternative to the current system.\n\nLess Animal Testing\n\nMedications, therapies and procedures are commonly tested for safety and effectiveness on animals before they can make it to market, due to similarities found between our DNA. Enter bioprinting: the perfect simulation of human tissues engineered from human cells. In 2015, cosmetics conglomerate L’oreal partnered with San Diego-based bioprinting startup Organovo to 3D-print skin sample swatches used to test their products. The company has actually been farming derma since the 1980s — producing 100,000 skin samples per year — and claims on its website to have completely given up on animal testing altogether.\n\nChallenges of 3D-Printed Organs\n\nCell Damage During Production\n\nCells undergo a considerable amount of stress during the 3D-printing process — from undersized nozzles to highly pressurized, nutrient-deficient environments. Poor conditions may result in cell damage or even cell death, and can compromise the overall functionality of the artificial organ. Keeping living cells alive becomes even more of a challenge when building structures at scale, as more resources are required to “feed” a living organism.\n\nLow-Quality Printers\n\n3D printing was originally invented to fabricate plastic and metal parts for the sake of rapid prototyping. In this way, bioprinting has always been a matter of reverse engineering, repurposing the tech to create objects out of human tissue. Today’s machines lack the ability to print at both high resolution and ideal viscosity to recreate complex structures that can hold their shape.\n\nLimited Availability of Biomaterials\n\nOne reason why traditional tissue engineering has yet to fully reproduce biomimetic tissues is due to the lack of biomaterials available. While researchers find workarounds using different techniques, researchers note that there is only a limited number of bio-inks that fulfill the physicochemical requirements to successfully survive the 3D-printing process. Most recently, hydrogel additives have fostered more biocompatible, printable and mechanically viable feedstocks.\n\nCan 3D-Printed Organs Be Rejected?\n\nYes — and that has more to do with the body’s natural immune response than the technology itself. The main reason why about 10 to 30 percent of transplant patients experience organ rejection is because their immune system mistakes the transplanted organ as a foreign body, and attacks it. Despite immunosuppressive medications, this bodily phenomenon remains a threat — whether the organ comes 3D-printed or not.\n\nThe hope, however, is that bioprinting organs that are tailor-made from the patient’s own cells may greatly reduce this risk.\n\n“3D bioprinting offers a potential solution to the problem of transplant rejection,” said Matthews, who is currently studying how to biofabricate cardiac patches to treat heart failure. “Since the transplant wouldn’t look like a foreign body to the immune system, it would not trigger a rejection response.”\n\nThe Future of 3D-Printed Organs\n\nThere is still a lot of ground to cover in the bioprinted corner of health tech before donors become obsolete. And it starts with better hardware.\n\nManufacturing 3D bioprinters that can incorporate several bio-inks in a single print design is imperative to the next wave of 3D-printed treatments, Matthews said. They need to perform faster and at higher resolutions. Only then can bio-inks level up. Improved printability and durability mean precise patterns that can better maintain their structure over time. One study described the advancements in both bioprinters and the software behind them as an “inevitable trend” to come.\n\nThe next major breakthrough in bioprinting will likely involve generating microscopic vascular networks built into the artificial organs as they print, according to Ryan Creek, a certified physician associate researching regenerative medicine at biotech startups. This needle-moving development would allow 3D-printed organs to establish circulation via tiny blood vessels, allowing them to transport nutrients, blood cells, oxygen and waste products on their own.\n\nSo while there are several boundary conditions boxing researchers into operating on a smaller, organoid scale, one of the main obstacles is connecting these mini-organs to a sufficient blood supply, such as that found in the human body, before its cells die off.\n\n“It’s not a significant leap to scale [organoids] up to larger sizes,” Creek said, “But as the organoid gets larger, we reach a point where these structures can no longer survive off of the simple diffusion of nutrients.”\n\nAll of these technical difficulties are small hurdles along the way to a much bigger goal — treating the over 103,000 applicants on the national transplant list.\n\n“Many patients die before they can get an organ transplant,” Creek said. “A new organ generated from the patient’s own cells would be a game changer.”\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

      "# [39 Types of Diversity in the Workplace to Know by Bailey Reiners on 2022-06-15](https://builtin.com/diversity-inclusion/types-of-diversity-in-the-workplace)\nDiversity encompasses the qualities and characteristics that distinguish individuals from one another. Some common characteristics that signify diversity in the workplace might include gender identity, race and sexuality — but there are many more characteristics and experiences that people can bring to their work that employers and HR teams should be aware of.\n\nThe number of factors that define diversity is truly unlimited. Throughout an individual’s life, the unique biological and genetic predispositions, experiences and education alter who they are as a person. These experiences are what diversify and evolve communities, allowing individuals to connect and learn from each other.\n\nBenefits of Diversity in the Workplace\n\nWhy prioritize a diverse workplace? For starters, it’s good for employees. Diverse teams add a richness to the workplace experience; employees like collaborating with people from a range of backgrounds and experiences. Diverse teams work better together, which fosters workplace satisfaction and the feeling of team unity.\n\nSecondly, it’s good for business. Diverse employees bring different skills, talents and lived experience to their work, boosting creativity and innovation and increasing the likelihood of reaping financial rewards.\n\nWith how diversity can be fostered and reshape organizations in mind, let’s take a deeper dive into the distinct characteristics that make us unique from one another.\n\nRelatedWhat Is Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB)?\n\nTypes of Internal Diversity\n\nInternal diversity includes traits or characteristics that an individual is born with and often can’t be changed. Characteristics associated with internal diversity are a core part of one’s identity.\n\n1. RACE\n\nRace is a social construct used to group individuals, largely based on certain physical appearances and social factors. Some examples of race include white, Black or African American, Indian or Alaska Native as well as Asian and Pacific Islander.\n\n2. ETHNICITY\n\nEthnicity is different from race, as it groups individuals based on shared culture, learned behaviors and other regional similarities beyond physical appearance. Ethnicity is associated with cultural experiences, history, upbringing, nationality, language, customs, geographical background and more. Common examples of ethnicity include Hispanic or Latine, Irish, Jewish or Cambodian.\n\n3. GENDER\n\nGender is a social construct that varies by different cultures, and is assigned to individuals at birth based on their biological sex — often as female or male. Though this gender binary is widely recognized, gender may or may not correspond to an individual’s sex assigned at birth, and can exist within a spectrum of different identities.\n\nIndividuals may identify as transgender, meaning they identify with a gender that is different from the one they were assigned at birth. This can include transitioning to another binary gender, such as woman or man, or even a gender completely outside of this binary. Gender identities outside of woman or man can include non-binary, genderqueer, genderfluid and more. There are also non-gendered identities, such as agender, genderless and gender-free.\n\nGender identities are defined by the individual and how they view and expect others to view themself. Keep in mind that individuals may identify differently from how you perceive their identity, so it’s courteous to ask for people’s preferred pronouns as well as share your own.\n\n4. GENDER EXPRESSION\n\nGender expression, which may differ from an individual’s sex or gender identity, refers to the external appearance of an individual’s gender identity. Gender expression may be interpreted through clothing, hair, makeup, voice, behavior, mannerisms, interests and pronouns. Again, because you can not assume an individual’s gender even based on their gender expression, it’s important to ask for their pronouns. For more information on how to become an inclusive workplace for all gender identities and expressions, check out the Human Rights Campaign’s guide to gender identity and gender expression in the workplace.\n\nRelatedWhat Is Gender Bias in the Workplace?\n\n5. SEX\n\nUnlike gender identity and gender expression, sex refers to the biological and genetic differences between female-assigned and male-assigned bodies. More specifically, those assigned female at birth have two X chromosomes, and those assigned male at birth have one X and one Y chromosome. Typically, based on these chromosomes and other physical characteristics, people are grouped as either female or male.\n\nHowever, contrary to popular belief, the biology of sex has a spectrum of differences that cannot be classified simply as woman and man. Some people born with a combination of sex characteristics and reproductive organs are classified on the genetic sex spectrum as intersex.\n\n6. SEXUAL ORIENTATION\n\nSexual orientation is also different from gender identity, gender expression and biological sex. Sexual orientation is defined by the Human Rights Campaign as “an inherent or immutable enduring emotional, romantic or sexual attraction to other people.” Common sexual orientations include heterosexual, gay, lesbian, bisexual, asexual, pansexual and questioning.\n\nLess than half of U.S. states have laws in place that protect employees from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. As such, employers should take the initiative to create an inclusive workplace for LGBTQ individuals.\n\n7. AGE\n\nAt any given time, several generations are employed in the workforce. Each has its own distinct differences defined by the time people were born and the unique social, political and economic changes that occurred during their upbringing.\n\nIn the workforce, such differences can pose challenges for individuals among generations. These challenges can turn into an unconscious bias known as ageism. Ageism in the workplace is defined as the tendency to have negative feelings about another person based on their age.\n\nStereotypes of different generations contribute to this bias. For example, Baby Boomers are seen as workaholics, Generation Xers are risk takers, Millennials care about meaningful work and Generation Zers ghost employers and seek job security. Such stereotypes can lead employers and colleagues to believe there are skill gaps and life milestones — like having children or retiring — may affect certain age groups from excelling at their company.\n\nWhile ageism can affect any member of the workforce, 64 percent of workers over the age of 50 believe they face age discrimination and 90 percent think ageism is common in the workplace.\n\n8. PHYSICAL ABILITIES AND DISABILITIES\n\nHiring individuals with varying disabilities and experiences will help your team build a more diverse and inclusive environment and bring unique perspectives and ideas to help your company reach a wider market of customers and clients.\n\nStart by checking how your company stands against the national Disability Equality Index. Also, consider ways to boost disability inclusivity at your office and throughout your hiring process, including establishing an employee resource group, partnering with advocacy groups and designing your application process with accessibility in mind.\n\nAdditionally, ensure your office is ADA compliant and make available ramps, automated doors, visual aids, telephone headsets, screen readers as well as accommodations for service animals, so if a job seeker or employee requires an aid of some sort, you are prepared to support their needs.\n\n9. COGNITIVE DISABILITIES\n\nCognitive disabilities, also known as intellectual functioning, are recognized by the EEOC when an individual meets these criteria:\n\nIntellectual functioning level (IQ) below 70-75\n\nSignificant limitations in adaptive skills — the basic conceptual, social and practical skills needed for everyday life\n\nDisability began before age 18\n\nDifferent functioning may affect an individual’s memory, problem-solving abilities, attention, communication, linguistics, as well as verbal, reading, math and visual comprehension. However, having an intellectual disability does not mean the person is not capable of great success as an employee.\n\nIntellectual functioning can be difficult to notice, understand and communicate for both employees and employers, so it’s important to provide employees with a variety of tools and resources that can help them function optimally at their job. The Job Accommodation Network provides a list of possible accommodations employers can provide to support employees of all abilities.\n\n10. NEURODIVERSITY\n\nNeurodiversity, as defined by the National Symposium on Neurodiversity, “is a concept where neurological differences are to be recognized and respected as any other human variation. These differences can include those labeled with dyspraxia, dyslexia, ADHD, dyscalculia, autism spectrum, Tourette syndrome, and others.”\n\nWhile certain stereotypes and stigmas might surround neurodiverse individuals, research shows that some conditions, like autism and dyslexia, enhance an individual’s ability to recognize patterns, retain information and excel in certain subjects — all critical skills for any job.\n\nRelated5 Companies That Hire Adults With Autism\n\n11. NATIONAL ORIGIN\n\nNo matter where your company is headquartered or how many remote employees your company has on staff, it is likely that you will work and interact with people who were born in a different country than yourself.\n\nRegardless of where a person may currently be located, the country where one is born within can provide a set of cultural traits that one may carry with them for their entire life. From religious beliefs to personal ethos and much more, a person’s national origin can define many things about them that they may carry with them for life.\n\n12. CULTURAL BACKGROUND\n\nA number of factors, including food, language, religion and customs, make up different cultures.\n\nWhile many people enjoy learning about other cultures, it’s an entirely different experience to work with people who come from different cultures.\n\nCultural differences can bring a wealth of learning opportunities as well as some complicated challenges among employees unfamiliar with someone else’s culture.\n\nIt’s important to educate your team about different cultures and celebrate the differences. Additionally, creating a culture that encourages open communication will help employees explore each other’s cultural differences without creating a hostile work environment.\n\n13. FAMILY AND UPBRINGING\n\nFamily affects every individual’s life. It plays a role in a person’s upbringing and provides support throughout an individual’s life. While some families are biologically related, others are chosen.\n\nNo matter what an individual’s family situation is, as an employer, it’s important to understand that everyone has obligations outside of work to the ones they love. By providing perks and benefits such as family medical leave, flexible work hours, child and elder care benefits, you will help employees foster close relationships with their family, thus enhancing their work-life balance and satisfaction.\n\nMore on DiversityWhat Does Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Mean in the Workplace?\n\nTypes of External Diversity\n\nExternal diversity includes certain circumstances or attributes that help describe an individual’s lived experiences. These characteristics can be changed over time.\n\n14. GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION\n\nGeographic location plays a major role in the culture, language, education, social roles, socioeconomic status, beliefs and ideologies with which a person is accustomed. Keep in mind that just because an individual lives in a particular location now, doesn’t mean they’ve always lived there. It’s important to get to know your candidates’ and colleagues’ rich history to better understand their unique experiences in life prior to working with you.\n\n15. LANGUAGE, LINGUISTICS AND ACCENTS\n\nLanguage, linguistics and accents can play a significant role in an individual’s ability to get and keep a job.\n\nIf a job description or recruitment materials are available in only one language, for instance English, some job seekers might find it difficult to apply for a role or make it through an interview process. While it is not feasible for any company to translate all of their recruitment materials into hundreds of different languages, it can be helpful to provide a few additional translations for common languages in your community and workplace. You may also consider utilizing an online translation service or in-person interpreter for roles that don’t require individuals to be fluent in a language to work.\n\nAdditionally, accents — the different ways individuals pronounce certain words within a language — can lead to accent bias or perception, where people judge or discriminate against an individual’s intelligence and abilities by the way they pronounce certain words. Individuals might also have an affinity for people who have a similar accent to their own. Understanding different accent biases will help you and your team to identify your own biases and challenge them when you meet people from different language backgrounds.\n\n16. INCOME\n\nIncome plays a major role in every individual’s life starting from the day they are born and throughout their upbringing, professional career and into retirement. Income can be affected by geographical location, taxes, family, education, skills and socioeconomic background. Unconscious biases related to an individual’s age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity and privilege can also affect their income.\n\nIn 2019, the Paycheck Fairness Act, first devised in 1997, was passed. This act prohibits employers from asking candidates how much they previously made, allows employees to share their pay with work colleagues and requires employers to disclose all pay information with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\n17. EDUCATION\n\nEducation varies greatly by location, school and teacher, and can be heavily influenced by national, state and district laws and requirements. This means that no single individual will have the exact same education. Not only that, but high-level education can be extremely expensive and unattainable for a significant part of the American population, and for upper-level jobs — or even entry-level jobs — post-high school degrees are often required.\n\nThe average cost of a four-year college degree continues to rise, leaving recent grads who took out loans an average of about $37,000 in debt, as of 2024. Not surprisingly, many talented young professionals are looking for alternative career paths that don’t require such exorbitant spending.\n\nOn the flip side, employers are creating opportunities to help such professionals bypass college in exchange for applicable experiences.\n\nSome companies no longer require candidates to complete a bachelor’s or master’s degree to compete for a role. Instead, companies are focusing on experiences, as well as hard skills and soft skills to qualify candidates. Additionally, removing education requirements allows candidates with more diverse, non-traditional backgrounds to apply.\n\n18. WORK EXPERIENCES\n\nEvery workplace is different. Every company has their own unique mission, core values, policies, culture and benefits, which vary by region, industry, size and employer. Each time an employee moves into a new role, industry or company, they bring their previous work experiences and skills with them.\n\nFor employers, it’s often beneficial to attract talent with diverse work experience, even hiring out-of-market candidates. Such experiences can help your team better understand different aspects of your own industries or reach new customer markets, so don’t count candidates out just because they have different workplace experiences.\n\n19. SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS\n\nSocioeconomic status is the measurement and categorization of people based on their education, income and occupation. It is also a strong indicator of privilege, as well as the opportunities and resources an individual has access to in order to excel at school and work.\n\nAdditionally, SES is found to correlate significantly to one’s mental health, physical health, stress, performance and functioning both in the workplace and in life.\n\nTo support candidates and employees of all SES, consciously create and distribute recruitment content that will reach and resonate with individuals of varying SES. As an employer, make sure to provide adequate salaries, benefits and resources to help individuals who are impacted by their own SES.\n\n20. CITIZENSHIP STATUS\n\nThe Immigration Reform and Control Act makes it illegal for employers to discriminate against candidates and employees when recruiting, referring, hiring or firing individuals based on their citizenship or immigration status. Even with such laws in place, citizenship status alone can play a significant role in foreign-born workers’ ability to get a job or break past stereotypes related to immigrants and citizenship status.\n\n21. MARITAL STATUS\n\nMarriage is a major event for many people. Getting married, divorced, separated or losing a spouse to death can alter an individual’s beliefs, geographical location, income, parental status, family, citizenship status, socioeconomic status, privilege, family and behaviors.\n\nSimilar to gender bias, marital status bias can prevent highly qualified individuals from getting a job or excelling in their career. And while national laws prohibit employers from discriminating against an individual’s gender, sex and sexual orientation, only a few states have specific laws prohibiting marital status discrimination in the workplace.\n\nMarital status can especially affect an individual in the workplace if their partner also works in the same place. Some companies have an anti-nepotism policy in place to prevent a family member from working on the same team or in hierarchy to one another.\n\n22. PARENTAL STATUS\n\nWhile parental status can affect both mothers and fathers, pregnant people, working mothers and people of childbearing age face a motherhood penalty or maternal wall. Stereotypes related to a woman’s role and needing time off after childbirth and for childcare often place women at a disadvantage in their careers compared to men and fathers.\n\nIn addition to working mothers, mothers with children under six were less likely to work in 2022, with just 65 percent being in the labor force. Meanwhile, 92 percent of men with children under six were likely to have a job in 2022. For individuals who take a large chunk of time off to fulfill caregiving needs, it can be extremely difficult for them to explain the gaps in their resume and find employers willing to support them as they reenter their career.\n\nEmployers can support working parents by reducing unconscious bias against them and by providing benefits like flexible work hours, childcare benefits, parental leave and adoption assistance to ease the challenges that working parents face and keep top employees in its workforce.\n\nRelated6 Ways to Support New Parents at Work\n\n23. MILITARY EXPERIENCE\n\nMilitary veterans offer a wealth of skills, knowledge and experience, making them exceptional contributions to any role or company. However, many employers are unfamiliar with military culture, experiences or common military language, which may make it difficult for them to understand the value such individuals can bring to a company. A number of resources are available to help employers better understand how military skills are relevant to a specific role, such as this military skills translator and this skills matcher.\n\nRelated23 Companies That Hire Veterans\n\n24. CRIMINAL BACKGROUND\n\nIn February 2022, the unemployment rate for formerly incarcerated individuals was estimated around 60 percent, while the U.S. national average unemployment rate for that same month was 3.8 percent. These individuals are in their prime working age but struggle to find a company that will hire them with a criminal background.\n\nAnd while some states provide incentives by offering tax breaks for companies that hire candidates with felony convictions, other states allow employers to require criminal history on job applications, perpetuating issues of social bias. Today, it’s still up to employers to decide whether or not they will allow an individual’s past to prevent them from excelling in a rewarding career in the future.\n\nRelated16 Companies That Hire Felons\n\n25. BEHAVIOR AND ETHNODIVERSITY\n\nEveryone has their own unique mannerisms and behavior patterns they develop throughout their lives. Such behaviors are a result of an individual’s upbringing, family, friends, culture, and they can be interpreted in different ways. This is an important element of diversity to recognize because while a behavior may seem ordinary or unremarkable to you, to someone else it may seem rude, odd or inappropriate.\n\nBehavioral diversity or ethnodiversity can be highly specific and subtle between individuals. It’s important to remember that behavior is a result of a person’s unique experiences, and if something feels odd, rude or inappropriate, consider politely asking them about why they do what they do rather than reacting negatively or being judgmental.\n\n26. PERSONALITY AND THOUGHT-STYLE\n\nBringing a variety of different personalities and thought-styles into a workplace can create both stressful situations and genius creativity. To avoid the former, companies opt for hiring for culture fit, which consequently halts the latter. Instead, companies should hire for culture and in pursuit of diverse personalities that work well together and challenge one another’s ideas and thoughts.\n\nIt’s difficult to know someone’s personality and thought-style by their resume or even interview, which is why some organizations ask job candidates to complete personality tests. Doing so helps companies understand their strengths, weaknesses and gaps and build a company culture that supports extroverts, introverts and everyone in-between.\n\nWhile a number of companies boast about their team’s vast “diversity of thought,” it shouldn’t be the only metric by which your team measures its diversity. By hiring individuals with a wide range of diverse traits, you will naturally acquire people with diverse personalities and thought-styles.\n\n27. MENTAL HEALTH\n\nWithout the support and resources to seek and receive the help employees need, companies may see an increase in absences, work-family conflict, increased mental health and behavioral problems and even higher turnover rates.\n\nTo combat the stigma around mental health in the workplace, employers are improving resources, like insurance benefits, to cover mental health services and build a more inclusive company culture that supports mental health.\n\nRelated7 Companies With Wellness Programs\n\n28. SOCIAL ROLES\n\nSocial roles are constructs that are influenced by certain demographics of an individual, such as age, behavior, gender and culture. A common example is that of gender roles, which are assigned to individuals the moment their sex is identified and have unique precepts that vary by culture. Stereotypes are often correlated with social roles held about a particular demographic and can affect an individual’s ability to move into certain professional roles and industries and overcome barriers, which is evident between men and women with the glass ceiling.\n\nTo truly support diversity and inclusion in the workplace, it’s important to become acutely aware of social roles and stereotypes unique to your culture, community, industry and workplace. Your team can help to break down barriers and open opportunities for people regardless of perceived social roles by attracting a diverse employee base in your recruitment materials. This trucking company did just that when they launched a recruitment campaign about women truckers to attract more female candidates.\n\n29. PRIVILEGE\n\nPrivilege refers to social power that can be inhibited or compounded based on an individual’s sex, gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion, age, citizenship status, socioeconomic status, social role, cultural background and disability status. Privilege can affect a person’s ability to obtain certain levels and quality of education, jobs, higher income and opportunities throughout life.\n\nFor employers, it is important to consider an individual’s privilege and the opportunities they may or may not have access to due to their personal demographics. Let’s not forget the Varsity Blues college admissions scandal, where parents were able to influence undergraduate admission decisions, which shows how privilege and opportunity — rather than merit — can provide some individuals with more highly regarded experiences than others.\n\nRelated10 DEI Initiatives to Prioritize in the Workplace\n\nTypes of Worldview Diversity\n\nWorldview diversity refers to an individual’s personal perspectives, beliefs, historical knowledge and global experiences that affect how they view others and the world around them.\n\n30. RELIGIOUS AND SPIRITUAL BELIEFS\n\nWhether or not people discuss their religious affiliations at work, it’s important to create a workplace that is understanding and accepting of everyone’s beliefs, even if they are different from one another.\n\nEmployers can do this by offering floating holidays so that employees can take time off for religious holidays and celebrations when they need. It’s also important to respect individuals who wear religious clothing at work and ensure they are treated fairly and equally by their cohorts. Depending on your office and building layout, consider creating a space for private religious and spiritual practice so employees have a space to go during the day, and don’t have to leave work or disrupt colleagues.\n\n31. POLITICAL BELIEFS\n\nOpinions differ on how, when and if politics should be allowed in the workplace. For some, such discussions are a great way to connect with and engage in stimulating conversations unrelated to work. However, when colleagues have radically different political affiliations and views, controversy can erupt, making the workplace uncomfortable at best and unbearable at worst.\n\nNot only that, but bringing politics into the workplace can lead to issues around political affiliation discrimination. And while no national law prohibits employers from discriminating against a candidate or employee based on their political affiliation, a few states do.\n\nThat said, it can be extremely difficult to eliminate all traces of politics from the workplace. Just like every other element of diversity on this list, political diversity is also important for providing unique ideas, morals and beliefs to the workplace and fostering a truly diverse and inclusive workplace.\n\n32. IDEOLOGIES\n\nIdeologies are the conceptions an individual, group or culture have about different aspects of life. Most people have distinct economic, political and religious ideologies that are influenced by the people in their family, their upbringing, geographical location and education. Ideologies play a part in how often and comfortable employees share their opinions with colleagues. Vastly differing ideologies may make individuals more cautious to start a conversation with a coworker if they know it could lead to a heated debate.\n\n33. MORALS\n\nMorals reflect an individual’s beliefs for acceptable thoughts and behaviors. Morals tend to reflect an individual’s upbringing, family, life experiences, income, ideologies, cultural background, citizenship status, privilege, personalities, socioeconomic status, social roles, as well as social, religious, political and worldly beliefs.\n\nMost companies seek individuals whose personal morals, values and ethics align with the company’s core values. For employers, shared morals can alter how a company prioritizes its work and the impact it makes on the industry, local community and the world at large.\n\n34. LIFE EXPERIENCES\n\nLife experiences encompass all of the unique work, education, military, private and public occurrences an individual undergoes throughout their life that contributes to who they are, how they view the world and how they interact with others.\n\nRelatedHow to Make Diversity a Hiring Priority at the Startup Stage\n\nTypes of Organizational Diversity\n\nOrganizational diversity refers to how an individual is grouped as part of an organization.\n\n35. JOB FUNCTION AND DEPARTMENT\n\nRegardless of management status or seniority, job function and departmental placement are forms of organizational diversity that affect how people perform in the workplace. Different jobs place different expectations on people, meaning that experiences among employees of the same workplace, as well as the backgrounds that have brought them into the same workplace, will vary greatly.\n\nRemember that individual differences make each of your team members unique. Providing a workplace that allows for individuals to excel will only help your team grow and innovate. Individuals of all types of diversity on this list will experience different types of bias, which can affect their ability to excel in the workplace. When building out a diverse and inclusive workforce, continuously educate your team on why diversity and inclusion matters so everyone is on the same page.\n\n36. SENIORITY\n\nWorkplaces change over time; however, many employees will remain with a company for several years and gain seniority as their roles develop and new employees are welcomed into the workplace. Different levels of seniority at a company may lead to varying sets of opinions or values about how the company operates and may also be influenced by factors like age and personal beliefs.\n\nSome newer employees may carry a sense of inferiority to a senior employee, or in some cases may be asked to report to senior employees. All employees within an organization are guaranteed the same rights and are expected to complete the duties within their job description.\n\n37. MANAGEMENT STATUS\n\nSimilar to seniority, management status is a form of organizational diversity that is present in nearly every workplace. The vast majority of employees at every organization has somebody to report to and has a say in how their day-to-day time is spent at a company, as well as a set of expectations for the reportee.\n\nOrganizational hierarchy ensures that an organization is able to function appropriately and scale over time. Employees of varying management styles may have different sets of expectations applied to them but all employees are guaranteed the same rights while performing their duties.\n\n38. UNION AFFILIATION\n\nA form of both organizational and functional diversity in the workplace, union affiliation can be a hot topic in many workplaces. Employees of an organization may either choose to or may be required to join a local union based on the rules of a collective bargaining agreement between the employer and the union, dependent on if their state has a right-to-work law prohibiting labor unions and employers from entering into contracts in which only unionized employees may be hired.\n\nLabor union membership is intended as a way to protect employees from rights violations in their workplace, such as discrimination, overtime without pay, retaliation, privacy and whistleblower rights, however, many employees may be opposed to joining a labor union for a variety of reasons. Regardless of union status, all employees are still responsible for fulfilling their individual job requirements.\n\n39. SKILLS\n\nSkill set is a less obvious type of diversity, but one that is hugely important to the recruitment process. Depending on their professional history, candidates will have a particular skill set. However, based on their personal experiences and background, they’ll have a vastly different set of strengths that can benefit your business and culture. Suss out individual skills — emotional intelligence, budding leadership abilities and the like — to create a positive culture that allows employees to excel.\n\nWhile some skills are innate, others are learned. In the workplace, we tend to focus on the skills that directly apply to one’s specific role. However, other skills an individual picks up through their personal interests and experiences can make them excellent at their job. If you are able to hone these unique skills and encourage employees to bring them to work, your team will surely excel in innovation and creativity.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

We reserve, and you grant to us, the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you.\n\n7. DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\nExcept where prohibited by applicable law, this section addresses how any legal dispute between you and Built In will proceed in the unlikely event that such an event should occur.\n\n7.1 INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS\n\nIf you are you are dissatisfied with our Services for any reason, please contact us by email at customer[email protected] so that we can try to resolve your concerns without the need of outside assistance. If you choose to pursue a dispute, claim or controversy against Built In, these Terms will apply. For purposes of this dispute resolution process, Built In shall include our affiliates, employees, licensors, and service providers.\n\nBefore formally pursuing a Dispute (as defined below) in arbitration or small claims court, you agree to first send a detailed notice (\"Notice\") to Built In, Inc., by email at [email protected] or by mail at 222 Merchandise Mart Plaza Suite 2010, Chicago, Illinois 60654. Should Built In have a Dispute with you, Built In agrees to first send a Notice to you at your most recent email address on file with us, or if no email address is on file, using other contact information associated with your account. Any such Notice you provide must contain all of the following information: (1) your full name; (2) additional information that enables Built In to identify you, including your address, mobile phone number, and email address; and (3) a detailed description of your Dispute, including the nature and factual basis of your claim(s) and the relief you are seeking with a corresponding calculation of your alleged damages (if any). Built In’s Notice must likewise set forth a detailed description of its Dispute, which shall include the nature and factual basis of its claim(s) and the relief it is seeking, with a corresponding calculation of our damages (if any).\n\nYou and Built In agree to then negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve the Dispute. As part of these good faith negotiations, if Built In requests a telephone conference with you to discuss your Dispute, you agree to personally participate, with your attorney if you are represented by counsel. Likewise, if you request a telephone conference to discuss Built In’s Dispute with you, Built In agrees to have one representative participate. This informal process should lead to a resolution of the Dispute. However, if the Dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of a fully completed Notice and the Parties have not otherwise mutually agreed to an extension of this informal dispute resolution time period, you or Built In may initiate an arbitration (subject to a Party’s right to elect small claims court as provided below).\n\nCompletion of this informal dispute resolution is a condition precedent to filing any demand for arbitration or small claims court action. Failure to do so is a breach of this agreement. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines will be tolled while you and Built In engage in this informal dispute resolution process. Unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration provider, the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration and shall administratively close any arbitration unless the Party bringing such demand for arbitration can certify in writing that the terms and conditions of this informal dispute resolution process were fully satisfied. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this provision and to enjoin any arbitration proceeding or small claims court action.\n\n7.2 INDIVIDUAL RELIEF: CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER\n\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, YOU AND BUILT IN EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES IN COURT IN FAVOR OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PROVIDED ABOVE). YOU AND BUILT IN EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO FILE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER OR OTHERWISE TO SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS, INCLUDING ANY CURRENTLY PENDING ACTIONS AGAINST YOU OR BUILT IN. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, CONSOLIDATED, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS. THE ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THE SAME RELIEF AVAILABLE IN COURT PROVIDED THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY ONLY AWARD FINAL RELIEF (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE OR DECLARATORY RELIEF) IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE FINAL RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD FINAL RELIEF FOR, AGAINST, OR ON BEHALF OF ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS. IF A COURT DETERMINES THAT ANY OF THESE PROHIBITIONS IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE UNENFORCEABLE AS TO A PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF (SUCH AS A REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF), AND ALL APPEALS OF THAT DECISION ARE EXHAUSTED OR THE DECISION IS OTHERWISE FINAL, THEN YOU AND BUILT IN AGREE THAT THAT PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF SHALL PROCEED IN COURT BUT SHALL BE STAYED PENDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION OF THE REMAINING CLAIMS FOR RELIEF THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT. IF THIS SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION (EXCEPT FOR THE JURY TRIAL WAIVER AND THE INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS) SHALL BE NULL AND VOID. THIS PARAGRAPH IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.\n\n7.3 DISPUTE RESOLUTION THROUGH ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT\n\nAny dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Built In that is not resolved informally by Built In CustomerService or through the informal dispute resolution process that arises from or relates in any way to this agreement (including any alleged breach of this agreement), the Services, or our relationship with you (collectively, “Dispute”), shall be exclusively resolved through BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION except as specifically provided otherwise in this Dispute Resolution Section 7. “Dispute” as used in this agreement shall have the broadest possible meaning and include claims that arose before the existence of this or any prior agreement and claims that arise during the term of this agreement or after the termination of this agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Built In may elect to have an individual claim heard in small claims court. If the request to proceed in small claims court is made after an arbitration has been initiated but before an arbitrator has been appointed, such arbitration shall be administratively closed. Any controversy over the small claims court’s jurisdiction shall be determined by the small claims court. All other issues (except as otherwise provided herein) are exclusively for the Arbitrator to decide, including but not limited to scope and enforceability of this Dispute Resolution Section 7, as well as any request to proceed in small claims court that is made after an arbitrator has been appointed. If you or Built In challenges the small claims court election in your Dispute, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the small claims court election is unenforceable, then such election shall be severed from this agreement as to your Dispute. However, such court determination shall not be considered or deemed binding with respect to Built In’s other contracting parties.\n\nAny court proceeding to enforce this Dispute Resolution Section, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, must be commenced in accordance with the Jurisdiction section of these Terms. In the event this Dispute Resolution Section is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against Built In (except for small claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Delaware. You hereby irrevocably consent to those courts’ exercise of personal jurisdiction over you for such purposes and waive any claim that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.\n\n7.4 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ARBITRATION PROTOCOL\n\nThis subsection applies to Disputes that are submitted to AAA after fully completing the informal Notice and Dispute resolution process described above and when no small claims court election is made by either Party. Any arbitration between you and Built In shall be administered by AAA in accordance with the operative AAA Arbitration Rules (the \"AAA Rules\") in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with AAA, such as the Consumer Arbitration Rules or the Consumer Mass Arbitration Rules, as may be appropriate in the context of the dispute and as modified by this Dispute Resolution Section. For a copy of the AAA Rules, please visit https://www.adr.org/Rules or contact AAA [email protected]. If AAA is unable or unwilling to perform its duties under this agreement, the Parties shall mutually agree on an alternative administrator that will replace AAA and assume AAA’s role consistent with this agreement. If the Parties are unable to agree, they will petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an administrator that will assume AAA’s duties under this agreement.\n\nThe Parties agree that the following procedures will apply to any Arbitrations initiated under this Dispute Resolution Section:\n\nCommencing an Arbitration - To initiate an arbitration, you or Built In shall send to AAA a demand for arbitration (\"Demand for Arbitration\") that describes the claim(s) and request for relief in detail, consistent with the requirements in this agreement and AAA Rules. If you send a Demand for Arbitration, you shall also send it to Built In at Built In, Inc., 222 Merchandise Mart Plaza Suite 2010, Chicago, Illinois 60654, within 10 days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration to AAA. If Built In sends a Demand for Arbitration, we will also send it to your mailing address on file with us within the same 10-day period. If your mailing address is unavailable, we will send it to your email address on file, or if no email address is on file, other contact information associated with your account. The arbitration provider shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration and shall administratively close any such demand for arbitration that fails to certify in writing that the Party meets the requirements of this Dispute Resolution Section or if either Party elects small claims court as set forth above.\n\nFees – The payment of all fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules, except to the extent that the case is a part of a Mass Filing (as defined below) or the AAA fees and costs (including Arbitrator fees) paid by either Party are reallocated upon order of the Arbitrator following a determination that (a) either Party breached Dispute Resolution section of this agreement, (b) such reallocation is called for under this agreement, or (c) reallocation is otherwise permitted under applicable law. Upon a showing to Built In of your financial hardship we will consider a good faith request made by you to pay your portion of the applicable consumer portion of the filing fee. Built In is committed to ensuring that arbitration costs to consumers do not serve as a barrier to the adjudication of disputes. If Built In initiates an arbitration against you, we shall pay all fees.\n\nThe Arbitrator – The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral (the \"Claim Arbitrator\"), as assisted by any Process Arbitrator appointed under AAA Rules. (The term \"Arbitrator\" applies to both the Claim Arbitrator and the Process Arbitrator). If a hearing is elected by either Party, the Arbitrator shall be in or close to the location in which you reside. The Arbitrator is bound by and shall adhere to this agreement. In the event AAA Rules conflict with this agreement, the terms of this agreement shall control. If the Arbitrator determines that strict application of any term of this Dispute Resolution section of this agreement (except for the small claims election, which shall be determined by the small claims court) would result in a fundamentally unfair arbitration (the \"Unfair Term\"), then the Arbitrator shall have authority to modify the Unfair Term to the extent necessary to ensure a fundamentally fair arbitration that is consistent with the Terms of Use (the \"Modified Term\"). In determining the substance of a Modified Term, the Arbitrator shall select a term that comes closest to expressing the intention of the Unfair Term.\n\nDispositive Motions– The Parties agree that the Claim Arbitrator shall have the authority to consider dispositive motions without an oral evidentiary hearing. Dispositive motions may be requested under the following circumstances: (a) within 30 days after the Claim Arbitrator’s appointment, a Party may request to file a dispositive motion based upon the pleadings; and (b) no later than 30 days prior to the evidentiary hearing, a Party may request to file a dispositive motion for summary judgment based upon the Parties’ pleadings and the evidence submitted.\n\nDiscovery – Each Party may (a) serve up to five requests for relevant, non-privileged documents from the other Party; and (b) request that the other Party provide verified responses to no more than 5 relevant interrogatories (including subparts). Unless both Parties agree otherwise, no other forms of discovery (including depositions) may be utilized. Any such discovery requests must be served on the other Party within 21 days after the Claim Arbitrator’s appointment. The responding Party shall provide the requesting Party with all responsive, non-privileged documents, responses signed by the Party themselves to the requested interrogatories, and/or any objections to the requests within 30 days after receipt of the requests, or, in the event of an objection to any discovery request, 30 days after the Claim Arbitrator resolves the dispute. In the event either Party requests that the Claim Arbitrator consider a dispositive motion on the pleadings, such written discovery response deadlines shall be extended until 30 days following the Claim Arbitrator’s final decision on such dispositive motion. Any disputes about discovery or requests for extensions shall be submitted promptly to the Claim Arbitrator for resolution. In ruling on any discovery dispute or extension request, the Claim Arbitrator shall take into consideration the nature, amount, and scope of the underlying arbitration claim, the cost and other effort that would be involved in providing the requested discovery, the case schedule, and whether the requested discovery is necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim or defense.\n\nConfidentiality – Upon either Party’s request, the Arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either Party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal.\n\nArbitration Hearing – You and Built In are entitled to a fair evidentiary hearing (i.e. trial) before the Claim Arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings are usually simpler, less costly, and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. The Parties agree to waive all oral hearings and instead submit all disputes to the Claim Arbitrator for an award based on written submissions and other evidence as the Parties may agree, unless a Party requests an oral hearing within 10 days after the Respondent files a response. If an oral evidentiary hearing is requested, both Parties must be personally present at the hearing, regardless of whether either Party has retained counsel. Both Parties must personally attend the hearing. Either Party’s failure to personally attend the hearing, without a continuance ordered by the Claim Arbitrator for good cause, will result in a default judgment taken against that Party.\n\nArbitration Award – Regardless of the format of the arbitration, the Claim Arbitrator shall provide a reasoned decision, in writing within 30 days after the hearing or, if no hearing is held, within 30 days after any rebuttal or supplemental statements are due. The decision must clearly specify the relief, if any, awarded and contain a brief statement of the reasons for the award. The arbitration award is binding only between you and Built In and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different Party. The Claim Arbitrator may, however, choose to consider rulings from other arbitrations involving a different Party. The Arbitrator may award fees and costs as provided by the AAA Rules or to the extent such fees and costs could be awarded in court. This includes but is not limited to the ability of the Arbitrator to award fees and costs if the Arbitrator determines that a claim or defense is frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose, for the purpose of harassment, or in bad faith.\n\nOffer of Settlement – The Respondent may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer to the opposing Party any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the Claim Arbitrator until after the Claim Arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the opposing Party’s favor and is less than the Respondent’s settlement offer or if the award is in the Respondent’s favor, the opposing Party must pay the Respondent’s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney’s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the flipping of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs that claimant may be entitled to for the cause of action under which it is suing.\n\nMass Filing – If, at any time, 25 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against Built In or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities (\"Mass Filing\"), consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings set forth in the AAA’s Mass Arbitration supplemental rules and procedures (\"AAA’s Mass Filing Rules\", available at https://www.adr.org/Rules), the additional protocols set forth below shall apply.\n\nIf you or your counsel file a Demand for Arbitration that fits within the definition of Mass Filing referred to above, then you agree that your Demand for Arbitration shall be subject to the additional protocols set forth in this Mass Filing subsection. You also acknowledge that the adjudication of your Dispute might be delayed and that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled from the time at which the first cases are chosen to proceed until your case is chosen for a bellwether proceeding.\n\nAAA’s Mass Filing Rules shall apply if your Dispute is deemed by AAA, in its sole discretion pursuant to its Rules and this Dispute Resolution Section, to be part of a Mass Filing. Such election for AAA’s Mass Filing Rules and related fee schedule must be made by either you or Built In in writing and submitted to AAA’s and all Parties.\n\nBellwether Proceedings. Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by courts and arbitration administrators when there are multiple disputes involving similar claims against the same or related parties. Counsel for the Mass Filings claimants (including you) and counsel for Built In shall each select 15 Demands for Arbitration (30 total), and no more than 30 arbitrations shall be filed, processed, adjudicated, or pending at the same time, with each of the 30 individual arbitrations presided over by a different Claim Arbitrator, in a first set of bellwether proceedings. During this time, no other Demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed, adjudicated, or pending. If the Parties are unable to resolve the remaining Demands for Arbitration after the first set of bellwether proceedings are arbitrated or otherwise resolved, then counsel for the Claimants and counsel for Built In shall each select an additional 15 Demands for Arbitration (30 total) to be filed, processed, and adjudicated as individual arbitrations, with each of the 30 arbitrations presided over by a different Claim Arbitrator, in a second set of bellwether proceedings. During this time, no other Demands for Arbitration that are part of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed, or adjudicated. This staged process of bellwether proceedings, with each set including 30 Demands for Arbitration adjudicated on an individual basis, shall continue until each Demand included in the Mass Filings (including your Demand for Arbitration) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Fees associated with a Demand for Arbitration included in the Mass Filings, including fees owed by Built In and the claimants (including you), shall only be due after your Demand for Arbitration is chosen as part of a set of bellwether proceedings and therefore properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication. Any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning when you initiate the informal dispute resolution process set forth in subsection 7.1, and if the first Mass Filings’ Demands for Arbitration are chosen for the initial set of bellwether proceedings have been filed, your claims will remain tolled until your Demand for Arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled. A court of competent jurisdiction located in a venue allowed under Section 8 of the agreement shall have the power to enforce this subsection.\n\nYou and Built In agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of the arbitration and small claims court process and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Built In acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the fair resolution of genuine and sincere Disputes. The Parties further agree that application of these Mass Filings procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.\n\n7.5 FUTURE CHANGES AND RETROACTIVE APPLICATION\n\nThis Dispute Resolution Section 7 applies to all Disputes between the Parties, including for any claims that accrued against you or Built In prior to the time of your consent to this agreement and to any claims that accrue against you or Built In after your consent to this agreement. Notwithstanding any provision in this agreement to the contrary, you may elect to opt out of the retroactive application of this Dispute Resolution Section 7 as to claims that have accrued against you or against Built In prior to the time of your consent to this agreement in accordance with the opt-out instructions below.\n\n7.6 ARBITRATION OPT-OUT PROCEDURE\n\nYou may opt-out of this Dispute Resolution Section 7by sending us written notice, within 30 days of the time you consent to this agreement, to the following email address: [email protected]. Please do not direct any customer support inquiries to this address, as they will not be addressed; such inquiries should be directed to customer[email protected].

Please note: if you opt out of the application of this Dispute Resolution Section 7, you will still be subject to and bound by any Dispute Resolution Sections and Arbitration Procedures you may have previously agreed to, including any arbitration provisions, class action waivers, and retroactive application sections.\n\n8. JURISDICTION\n\nTo the fullest extent allowable by law, these Terms, and any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms or related in any way to the Services, including but not limited to the validity, construction, and performance of these Terms, will be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent.\n\n11.6 Our waiver of any breach of these Terms will not be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach thereof.\n\n11.7 If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. If such modification is not permitted under law, that provision will be struck and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. However, any clauses so struck shall serve as evidence of the intent of the Parties in entering into this agreement and this intent shall inform the interpretation of the remaining portions of this agreement.\n\n11.8 Built In is based in the United States. As such, any information made available to Built In may be transferred to and processed in jurisdictions including the United States.",
      "# [Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Explained by Zakaria Jaadi on 2021-04-01](https://builtin.com/data-science/step-step-explanation-principal-component-analysis)\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is a widely covered machine learning method on the web. And while there are some great articles about it, many go into too much detail. Below we cover how principal component analysis works in a simple step-by-step way, so everyone can understand it and make use of it — even those without a strong mathematical background.\n\nPrincipal component analysis can be broken down into five steps. I’ll go through each step, providing logical explanations of what PCA is doing and simplifying mathematical concepts such as standardization, covariance, eigenvectors and eigenvalues without focusing on how to compute them.\n\nFirst, some basic (and brief) background is necessary for context.\n\nWhat Is Principal Component Analysis?\n\nPrincipal component analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.\n\nReducing the number of variables of a data set naturally comes at the expense of accuracy, but the trick in dimensionality reduction is to trade a little accuracy for simplicity. Because smaller data sets are easier to explore and visualize, and thus make analyzing data points much easier and faster for machine learning algorithms without extraneous variables to process.\n\nSo, to sum up, the idea of PCA is simple: reduce the number of variables of a data set, while preserving as much information as possible.\n\nWhat Are Principal Components?\n\nPrincipal components are new variables that are constructed as linear combinations or mixtures of the initial variables. These combinations are done in such a way that the new variables (i.e., principal components) are uncorrelated and most of the information within the initial variables is squeezed or compressed into the first components. So, the idea is 10-dimensional data gives you 10 principal components, but PCA tries to put maximum possible information in the first component, then maximum remaining information in the second and so on, until having something like shown in the scree plot below.\n\nOrganizing information in principal components this way will allow you to reduce dimensionality without losing much information, and this by discarding the components with low information and considering the remaining components as your new variables.\n\nAn important thing to realize here is that the principal components are less interpretable and don’t have any real meaning since they are constructed as linear combinations of the initial variables.\n\nGeometrically speaking, principal components represent the directions of the data that explain a maximal amount of variance, that is to say, the lines that capture most information of the data. The relationship between variance and information here, is that, the larger the variance carried by a line, the larger the dispersion of the data points along it, and the larger the dispersion along a line, the more information it has. To put all this simply, just think of principal components as new axes that provide the best angle to see and evaluate the data, so that the differences between the observations are better visible.\n\nHow PCA Constructs the Principal Components\n\nAs there are as many principal components as there are variables in the data, principal components are constructed in such a manner that the first principal component accounts for the largest possible variance in the data set. For example, let’s assume that the scatter plot of our data set is as shown below, can we guess the first principal component ? Yes, it’s approximately the line that matches the purple marks because it goes through the origin and it’s the line in which the projection of the points (red dots) is the most spread out. Or mathematically speaking, it’s the line that maximizes the variance (the average of the squared distances from the projected points (red dots) to the origin).\n\nThe second principal component is calculated in the same way, with the condition that it is uncorrelated with (i.e., perpendicular to) the first principal component and that it accounts for the next highest variance.\n\nThis continues until a total of p principal components have been calculated, equal to the original number of variables.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation of PCA\n\nStep 1: Standardization\n\nThe aim of this step is to standardize the range of the continuous initial variables so that each one of them contributes equally to the analysis.\n\nMore specifically, the reason why it is critical to perform standardization prior to PCA, is that the latter is quite sensitive regarding the variances of the initial variables. That is, if there are large differences between the ranges of initial variables, those variables with larger ranges will dominate over those with small ranges (for example, a variable that ranges between 0 and 100 will dominate over a variable that ranges between 0 and 1), which will lead to biased results. So, transforming the data to comparable scales can prevent this problem.\n\nMathematically, this can be done by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each value of each variable.\n\nOnce the standardization is done, all the variables will be transformed to the same scale.\n\nStep 2: Covariance Matrix Computation\n\nThe aim of this step is to understand how the variables of the input data set are varying from the mean with respect to each other, or in other words, to see if there is any relationship between them. Because sometimes, variables are highly correlated in such a way that they contain redundant information. So, in order to identify these correlations, we compute the covariance matrix.\n\nThe covariance matrix is a p × p symmetric matrix (where p is the number of dimensions) that has as entries the covariances associated with all possible pairs of the initial variables. For example, for a 3-dimensional data set with 3 variables x, y, and z, the covariance matrix is a 3×3 data matrix of this from:\n\nSince the covariance of a variable with itself is its variance (Cov(a,a)=Var(a)), in the main diagonal (Top left to bottom right) we actually have the variances of each initial variable. And since the covariance is commutative (Cov(a,b)=Cov(b,a)), the entries of the covariance matrix are symmetric with respect to the main diagonal, which means that the upper and the lower triangular portions are equal.\n\nWhat do the covariances that we have as entries of the matrix tell us about the correlations between the variables?\n\nIt’s actually the sign of the covariance that matters:\n\nIf positive then: the two variables increase or decrease together (correlated)\n\nIf negative then: one increases when the other decreases (Inversely correlated)\n\nNow that we know that the covariance matrix is not more than a table that summarizes the correlations between all the possible pairs of variables, let’s move to the next step.\n\nStep 3: Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix to identify the principal components\n\nEigenvectors and eigenvalues are the linear algebra concepts that we need to compute from the covariance matrix in order to determine the principal components of the data.\n\nWhat you first need to know about eigenvectors and eigenvalues is that they always come in pairs, so that every eigenvector has an eigenvalue. Also, their number is equal to the number of dimensions of the data. For example, for a 3-dimensional data set, there are 3 variables, therefore there are 3 eigenvectors with 3 corresponding eigenvalues.\n\nIt is eigenvectors and eigenvalues who are behind all the magic of principal components because the eigenvectors of the Covariance matrix are actually the directions of the axes where there is the most variance (most information) and that we call Principal Components. And eigenvalues are simply the coefficients attached to eigenvectors, which give the amount of variance carried in each Principal Component.\n\nBy ranking your eigenvectors in order of their eigenvalues, highest to lowest, you get the principal components in order of significance.\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis Example:\n\nLet’s suppose that our data set is 2-dimensional with 2 variables x,y and that the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are as follows:\n\nIf we rank the eigenvalues in descending order, we get λ1>λ2, which means that the eigenvector that corresponds to the first principal component (PC1) is v1 and the one that corresponds to the second principal component (PC2) is v2.\n\nAfter having the principal components, to compute the percentage of variance (information) accounted for by each component, we divide the eigenvalue of each component by the sum of eigenvalues. If we apply this on the example above, we find that PC1 and PC2 carry respectively 96 percent and 4 percent of the variance of the data.\n\nStep 4: Create a Feature Vector\n\nAs we saw in the previous step, computing the eigenvectors and ordering them by their eigenvalues in descending order, allow us to find the principal components in order of significance. In this step, what we do is, to choose whether to keep all these components or discard those of lesser significance (of low eigenvalues), and form with the remaining ones a matrix of vectors that we call Feature vector.\n\nSo, the feature vector is simply a matrix that has as columns the eigenvectors of the components that we decide to keep. This makes it the first step towards dimensionality reduction, because if we choose to keep only p eigenvectors (components) out of n, the final data set will have only p dimensions.\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis Example:\n\nContinuing with the example from the previous step, we can either form a feature vector with both of the eigenvectors v1 and v2:\n\nOr discard the eigenvector v2, which is the one of lesser significance, and form a feature vector with v1 only:\n\nDiscarding the eigenvector v2 will reduce dimensionality by 1, and will consequently cause a loss of information in the final data set. But given that v2 was carrying only 4 percent of the information, the loss will be therefore not important and we will still have 96 percent of the information that is carried by v1.\n\nSo, as we saw in the example, it’s up to you to choose whether to keep all the components or discard the ones of lesser significance, depending on what you are looking for. Because if you just want to describe your data in terms of new variables (principal components) that are uncorrelated without seeking to reduce dimensionality, leaving out lesser significant components is not needed.\n\nStep 5: Recast the Data Along the Principal Components Axes\n\nIn the previous steps, apart from standardization, you do not make any changes on the data, you just select the principal components and form the feature vector, but the input data set remains always in terms of the original axes (i.e, in terms of the initial variables).\n\nIn this step, which is the last one, the aim is to use the feature vector formed using the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, to reorient the data from the original axes to the ones represented by the principal components (hence the name Principal Components Analysis). This can be done by multiplying the transpose of the original data set by the transpose of the feature vector.\n\nReferences:\n\n[Steven M.

      "# [Strong AI vs. Weak AI: What's the Difference? by Ellen Glover on 2022-09-29](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/strong-ai-weak-ai)\nAs artificial intelligence continues to grow more advanced, the threshold of what can be considered true intelligence continues to get more complicated to define.\n\nExperts insist that these machines aren’t as intelligent as humans — at least not yet. The existence of strong AI, or artificial intelligence that is capable of learning and thinking like humans do, remains theoretical for now.\n\nUntil then, we will have to settle for the type of artificial intelligence that exists today: weak AI, which focuses and excels in completing very specific tasks.\n\nBelow we dive deep into how strong AI and weak AI compare — and what we can expect from these technologies going forward.\n\nWhat Is Strong AI?\n\nStrong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence or AGI, is capable of behaving and performing actions in the same ways human beings can. AGI mimics human intelligence, and is able to solve problems and learn news skills in ways similar to our own.\n\n“The more an AI system approaches the abilities of a human being, with all the intelligence, emotion, and broad applicability of knowledge, the more ‘strong’ the AI system is considered,” Kathleen Walch, a managing partner at Cognilytica’s Cognitive Project Management for AI certification and co-host of the AI Today podcast, told Built In.\n\nStrong AI can generalize knowledge and apply that knowledge from one task to another, plan ahead according to current knowledge and adapt to an environment as changes occur, she added. “Once a system is able to do all of this, it would be considered AGI.”\n\nMore on AIThe Future of AI: How Artificial Intelligence Will Change the World\n\nExamples of Strong AI\n\nBecause it doesn’t actually exist yet, the only true examples of AGI are found in works of science fiction like Star Trek: The Next Generation, Wall-E and Her.\n\nIn practice, strong AI would be a game-changer for humanity. A computer with artificial general intelligence could scan all the world’s knowledge housed on the internet to solve some of the world’s most pressing problems, or even predict and address them before they come into existence in the first place.\n\n“The dream of strong AI,” said James Rolfsen, the global head of data analytics at Rappi, “is this idea of building an intelligent system which is capable of mastering not just a prespecified skill or prespecified objective, but of actually engineering a system that can dynamically adapt to any decision-making environment.”\n\nAs for a timeline, Rolfsen added, “I think we’re a lot closer than everybody knows.”\n\nThe Promise and Perils of Strong AI\n\nThe prospect of strong AI becoming so advanced that it surpasses human intelligence and capabilities breeds quite a bit of fear. Some of these fears include AGI taking over the world, or that all our data and privacy will be lost to AI.\n\nWalch insists that many of the fears people have regarding AI are “emotional more than [they are] rational.” However, she added, there are some valid concerns about AI that need to be dealt with, including lack of transparency (especially regarding deep learning), people misusing AI for nefarious purposes, bias, lack of security, and governments’ general ignorance when it comes to dealing with this technology legislatively.\n\nGoing forward, if people continue to feel threatened by increasingly sophisticated AI systems, there will be “major resistance,” according to Walch.\n\nAre We Close to Having Strong AI?\n\nWhile AI that is fully capable of learning, thinking and behaving like a real person doesn’t exist, there are some remarkably sophisticated systems out there approaching the AGI benchmark.\n\nOne of them is GPT-4, a multimodal large language model designed by OpenAI that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. GPT-4 and is not intelligent, per se, but it has been used to perform some extraordinary feats, including passing the bar exam, understanding image-based jokes and coding playable video games in seconds.\n\nAnother is MuZero, a computer program created by Google DeepMind that has managed to master games it has not even been taught how to play, including chess and an entire suite of Atari games, through sheer brute force in re-playing games millions of times.\n\nAt This Point You May Be WonderingWhat Can’t AI Do?\n\nWhat Is Weak AI?\n\nWeak AI is also known as specialized AI or narrow AI. It has the ability to perform very specialized tasks — much of the time even more successfully than humans.\n\nWeak AI is easily the most successful realization of AI to date. Two of the four functionality-based types of artificial intelligence fall under its umbrella: reactive machines and limited memory machines. Reactive machines are the most fundamental kind of AI in that they can respond to immediate requests and tasks, but aren’t capable of storing memory or learning from past experiences. Limited memory is the next step in AI’s evolution, which allows machines to store knowledge and use it to learn and train for future tasks.\n\nWeak AI’s limited functionality allows it to automate that specific task with ease, and its narrow focus has allowed it to power many technological breakthroughs in just the last few years.\n\nMore on AIAI Ethics: A Guide to Ethical AI\n\nExamples of Weak AI\n\nOne of the first, most famous examples of weak AI is Deep Blue, a computer created by IBM that beat world chess champion Gary Kasparov in a six-game match in 1997. Deep Blue was able to choose from hundreds of millions of moves, and managed to “see” 20 moves ahead of its opponent — a feat no human to date has been able to achieve.\n\nWe see examples of weak AI all around us: Smart assistants like Siri and Alexa are able to set reminders, search for online information and control the lights in people’s homes thanks to its ability to collect users’ information, learn their preferences and improve their experiences based on prior interactions. Self-driving cars use weak AI’s deep neural networks to detect objects around them, determine their distance from other cars, identify traffic signals and much more. Every time you go to Amazon to shop, or scroll through your feed on Facebook, everything you see on a page is personalized so you take the actions the company wants you to, with the help of data and AI.\n\n“People have no idea how much of their lives is actually governed by weak AI,” Rolfsen said.\n\nMore on AIWill We Ever See a Real-Life ‘Star Trek’ Universal Translator?\n\nStrong AI vs. Weak AI vs. Superintelligence\n\nIf weak AI automates specific tasks better than humans, and strong AI thinks and behaves with the same agility of humans, you may be wondering where artificial intelligence can go from there. And the answer is: superintelligence.\n\nA superintelligent machine would be completely self-aware, and surpass the likes of human intelligence in practically every way. And, like artificial general intelligence, it is complete science fiction (for now).\n\nNick Bostrom, a founding professor and leader of Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute, appears to have coined the term back in 1998, and predicted that we will have achieved superhuman artificial intelligence within the first third of the 21st century. In some ways, Rolfsen said, it is already among us in the form of weak AI.\n\nDeep Blue, for example, can play chess better than any human, making it a form of very specific superintelligence. But it’s still not generalized intelligence. Therefore, “we know that Deep Blue is not going to take over the world and enslave humans. We know that’s not going to happen because all Deep Blue knows how to do is play chess,” Rolfsen said.\n\nBut once we accomplish generalized superintelligence, then we’re getting into the possibility of computers potentially outwitting humans in every way — something truly nightmarish or incredibly exciting, depending on how you look at it. Either way, “it’s definitely going to happen,” according to Rolfsen.\n\nMore on AIWhat Is Transhumanism?\n\nHow Will We Know When We’ve Achieved Strong AI and Superintelligence?\n\nIf and when superintelligence — or even true artificial general intelligence — is achieved, how will we know when we’ve encountered an example of it? The answer is more complicated than you might think.\n\nFor a long time, a machine’s intelligence was evaluated with the Turing Test. Developed by Alan Turing in 1950, the test puts a human, a computer and an interrogator in a conversational setting. If the interrogator can’t distinguish between the human and the computer, then the computer has managed to convince the interrogator of its “humanness,” Rolfsen explained, thus rendering its intelligence indistinguishable from that of a human’s.\n\nNowadays, some very advanced chatbots can seemingly pass the Turing Test, despite being pieces of weak AI and, therefore, not as intelligent as humans. Walch said some experts believe that “once an AI system is able to really tell a joke, then you’ll know that it’s crossed over to AGI territory.”\n\n“The immense flexibility of the human mind is what captivates us and makes us believe that humans are different from machines.”\n\nFor Rolfsen, the standards are a bit higher. Generalized intelligence — our ability to adapt in unfamiliar environments using context and previous knowledge — is “one of the things that makes humans magical beings,” he said. We’re not going to just hand that out to any old machine.\n\n“The immense flexibility of the human mind is what captivates us and makes us believe that humans are different from machines,” Rolfsen said. “We’re holding all of these AI systems to a much higher standard than we even realize because we’re holding them to our highest standards [of ourselves].”\n\nFor instance, before Deep Blue, many other AI systems had managed to beat most humans at chess. But the general public wasn’t ready to call those other computers intelligent because, “most humans kind of suck at chess,” as Rolfsen put it. It took Deep Blue beating Gary Kasparov in that 1997 chess match for people to acknowledge that these systems could be considered intelligent in any sense.\n\nNow, as we continue to attempt to capture and digitize all the complexities of human intelligence, we’re not only pushing the limits of what it means to be artificially intelligent, but also what it means to truly be human.\n\n“I’ve actually learned more, a lot more, about humanity and what it means to be a human being by going through the process and attempting to replicate human decision making and human interaction,” Rolfsen said. “By working so intensely and advancing so quickly in our technology around AI, we’re actually learning so much more about what makes us human.”"
