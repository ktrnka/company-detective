      "# [Robotics: What Are Robots? by Sam Daley on 2019-04-12](https://builtin.com/robotics)\nRobotics is an interdisciplinary sector of science and engineering dedicated to the design, construction and use of mechanical robots. Our guide will give you a concrete grasp of robotics, including different types of robots and how they’re being applied across industries.\n\nWhat Is Robotics?\n\nRobotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that produces machines, called robots, that replicate or substitute for human actions. Robots perform basic and repetitive tasks with greater efficiency and accuracy than humans, making them ideal for industries like manufacturing. However, the introduction of artificial intelligence in robotics has given robots the ability to handle increasingly complex situations in various industries.\n\nWhat Is a Robot?\n\nA robot is a programmable machine that can complete a task, while the term robotics describes the field of study focused on developing robots and automation. Each robot has a different level of autonomy. These levels range from human-controlled bots that carry out tasks to fully-autonomous bots that perform tasks without any external influences.\n\nIn terms of etymology, the word ‘robot’ is derived from the Czech word robota, which means “forced labor.” The word first appeared in the 1920 play R.U.R., in reference to the play’s characters who were mass-produced workers incapable of creative thinking.\n\nRobotics Aspects\n\nMechanical Construction\n\nThe mechanical aspect of a robot helps it complete tasks in the environment for which it’s designed. For example, the Mars 2020 Rover’s wheels are individually motorized and made of titanium tubing that help it firmly grip the harsh terrain of the red planet.\n\nElectrical Components\n\nRobots need electrical components that control and power the machinery. Essentially, an electric current — a battery, for example — is needed to power a large majority of robots.\n\nSoftware Program\n\nRobots contain at least some level of computer programming. Without a set of code telling it what to do, a robot would just be another piece of simple machinery. Inserting a program into a robot gives it the ability to know when and how to carry out a task.\n\nWhat Are the Main Components of a Robot?\n\nControl System\n\nComputation includes all of the components that make up a robot’s central processing unit, often referred to as its control system. Control systems are programmed to tell a robot how to utilize its specific components, similar in some ways to how the human brain sends signals throughout the body, in order to complete a specific task. These robotic tasks could comprise anything from minimally invasive surgery to assembly line packing.\n\nSensors\n\nSensors provide a robot with stimuli in the form of electrical signals that are processed by the controller and allow the robot to interact with the outside world. Common sensors found within robots include video cameras that function as eyes, photoresistors that react to light and microphones that operate like ears. These sensors allow the robot to capture its surroundings and process the most logical conclusion based on the current moment and allows the controller to relay commands to the additional components.\n\nActuators\n\nA device can only be considered to be a robot if it has a movable frame or body. Actuators are the components that are responsible for this movement. These components are made up of motors that receive signals from the control system and move in tandem to carry out the movement necessary to complete the assigned task. Actuators can be made of a variety of materials, such as metal or elastic, and are commonly operated by use of compressed air (pneumatic actuators) or oil (hydraulic actuators) but come in a variety of formats to best fulfill their specialized roles.\n\nPower Supply\n\nLike the human body requires food in order to function, robots require power. Stationary robots, such as those found in a factory, may run on AC power through a wall outlet but more commonly, robots operate via an internal battery. Most robots utilize lead-acid batteries for their safe qualities and long shelf life while others may utilize the more compact but also more expensive silver-cadmium variety. Safety, weight, replaceability and lifecycle are all important factors to consider when designing a robot’s power supply.\n\nSome potential power sources for future robotic development also include pneumatic power from compressed gasses, solar power, hydraulic power, flywheel energy storage organic garbage through anaerobic digestion and nuclear power.\n\nEnd Effectors\n\nEnd effectors are the physical, typically external components that allow robots to finish carrying out their tasks. Robots in factories often have interchangeable tools like paint sprayers and drills, surgical robots may be equipped with scalpels and other kinds of robots can be built with gripping claws or even hands for tasks like deliveries, packing, bomb diffusion and much more.\n\nHow Do Robots Work?\n\nSome robots are pre-programmed to perform specific functions, meaning they operate in a controlled environment where they do simple, monotonous tasks — like a mechanical arm on an automotive assembly line.\n\nOther robots are autonomous, operating independently of human operators to carry out tasks in open environments. In order to work, they use sensors to perceive the world around them, and then employ decision-making structures (usually a computer) to take the optimal next step based on their data and mission.\n\nRobots may also work by using wireless networks to enable human control from a safe distance. These teleoperated robots usually work in extreme geographical conditions, weather and circumstances. Examples of teleoperated robots are the human-controlled submarines used to fix underwater pipe leaks during the BP oil spill or drones used to detect landmines on a battlefield.\n\nTypes of Robotics\n\nHumanoid Robots\n\nHumanoid robots are robots that look like or mimic human behavior. These robots usually perform human-like activities (like running, jumping and carrying objects), and are sometimes designed to look like us, even having human faces and expressions. Two of the most prominent examples of humanoid robots are Hanson Robotics’ Sophia and Boston Dynamics’ Atlas.\n\nCobots\n\nCobots, or collaborative robots, are robots designed to work alongside humans. These robots prioritize safety by using sensors to remain aware of their surroundings, executing slow movements and ceasing actions when their movements are obstructed. Cobots typically perform simple tasks, freeing up humans to address more complex work.\n\nIndustrial Robots\n\nIndustrial robots automate processes in manufacturing environments like factories and warehouses. Possessing at least one robotic arm, these robots are made to handle heavy objects while moving with speed and precision. As a result, industrial robots often work in assembly lines to boost productivity.\n\nMedical Robots\n\nMedical robots assist healthcare professionals in various scenarios and support the physical and mental health of humans. These robots rely on AI and sensors to navigate healthcare facilities, interact with humans and execute precise movements. Some medical robots can even converse with humans, encouraging people’s social and emotional growth.\n\nAgricultural Robots\n\nAgricultural robots handle repetitive and labor-intensive tasks, allowing farmers to use their time and energy more efficiently. These robots also operate in greenhouses, where they monitor crops and help with harvests. Agricultural robots come in many forms, ranging from autonomous tractors to drones that collect data for farmers to analyze.\n\nMicrorobotics\n\nMicrorobotics is the study and development of robots on a miniature scale. Often no bigger than a millimeter, microrobots can vary in size, depending on the situation. Biotech researchers typically use microrobotics to monitor and treat diseases, with the goal of improving diagnostic tools and creating more targeted solutions.\n\nAugmenting Robots\n\nAugmenting robots, also known as VR robots, either enhance current human capabilities or replace the capabilities a human may have lost. The field of robotics for human augmentation is a field where science fiction could become reality very soon, with bots that have the ability to redefine the definition of humanity by making humans faster and stronger. Some examples of current augmenting robots are robotic prosthetic limbs or exoskeletons used to lift hefty weights.\n\nSoftware Bots\n\nSoftware bots, or simply ‘bots,’ are computer programs which carry out tasks autonomously. They are not technically considered robots. One common use case of software robots is a chatbot, which is a computer program that simulates conversation both online and over the phone and is often used in customer service scenarios. Chatbots can either be simple services that answer questions with an automated response or more complex digital assistants that learn from user information.\n\nRobotics Applications\n\nBeginning as a major boon for manufacturers, robotics has become a mainstay technology for a growing number of industries.\n\nManufacturing\n\nIndustrial robots can assemble products, sort items, perform welds and paint objects. They may even be used to fix and maintain other machines in a factory or warehouse.\n\nHealthcare\n\nMedical robots transport medical supplies, perform surgical procedures and offer emotional support to those going through rehabilitation.\n\nCompanionship\n\nSocial robots can support children with learning disabilities and act as a therapeutic tool for people with dementia. They also have business applications like providing in-person customer service in hotels and moving products around warehouses.\n\nHome Use\n\nConsumers may be most familiar with the Roomba and other robot vacuum cleaners. However, other home robots include lawn-mowing robots and personal robot assistants that can play music, engage with children and help with household chores.\n\nSearch and Rescue\n\nSearch and rescue robots can save those stuck in flood waters, deliver supplies to those stranded in remote areas and put out fires when conditions become too extreme for firefighters.\n\nPros and Cons of Robotics\n\nRobotics comes with a number of benefits and drawbacks.\n\nPros of Robotics\n\nIncreased accuracy. Robots can perform movements and actions with greater precision and accuracy than humans.\n\nEnhanced productivity. Robots can work at a faster pace than humans and don’t get tired, leading to more consistent and higher-volume production.\n\nImproved safety. Robots can take on tasks and operate in environments unsafe for humans, protecting workers from injuries.\n\nRapid innovation. Many robots are equipped with sensors and cameras that collect data, so teams can quickly refine processes.\n\nGreater cost-efficiency. Gains in productivity may make robots a more cost-efficient option for businesses compared to hiring more human workers.\n\nCons of Robotics\n\nJob losses. Robotic process automation may put human employees out of work, especially those who don’t have the skills to adapt to a changing workplace.\n\nLimited creativity. Robots may not react well to unexpected situations since they don’t have the same problem-solving skills as humans.\n\nData security risks. Robots can be hit with cyber attacks, potentially exposing large amounts of data if they’re connected to the Internet of Things.\n\nMaintenance costs. Robots can be expensive to repair and maintain, and faulty equipment can lead to disruptions in production and revenue losses.\n\nEnvironmental waste. Extracting raw materials to build robots and having to discard disposable parts can lead to more environmental waste and pollution.\n\nFuture of Robotics\n\nThe evolution of AI has major implications for the future of robotics. In factories, AI can be combined with robotics to produce digital twins and design simulations to help companies improve their workflows. Advanced AI also gives robots increased autonomy. For example, drones could deliver packages to customers without any human intervention. In addition, robots could be outfitted with generative AI tools like ChatGPT, resulting in more complex human-robot conversations.\n\nAs robots’ intelligence has shifted, so too have their appearances. Humanoid robots are designed to visually appeal to humans in various settings while understanding and responding to emotions, carrying objects and navigating environments. With these forms and abilities, robots can become major contributors in customer service, manufacturing, logistics and healthcare, among other industries.\n\nWhile the spread of robotics has stoked fears over job losses due to automation, robots could simply change the nature of human jobs. Humans may find themselves collaborating with robots, letting their robotic counterparts handle repetitive tasks while they focus on more difficult problems. Either way, humans will need to adapt to the presence of robots as robotics continues to progress alongside other technologies like AI and deep learning.\n\nHistory of Robotics\n\nRobotics as a concept goes back to ancient times. The ancient Greeks combined automation and engineering to create the Antikythera, a handheld device that predicted eclipses. Centuries later, Leonardo Da Vinci designed a mechanical knight now known as “Leonardo’s Robot.” But it was the rise of manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution that highlighted the need for widespread automation.\n\nFollowing William Grey Walter’s development of the first autonomous robots in 1948, George Devol created the first industrial robotic arm known as Unimate. It began operating at a GM facility in 1959. In 1972, the Stanford Research Institute designed Shakey — the first AI-powered robot. Shakey used cameras and sensors to collect data from its surroundings and inform its next moves.\n\nThe ability of robots to perceive their surroundings led researchers to explore whether they could also perceive human emotions. In the late 1990s, MIT’s Dr. Cynthia Breazeal built Kismet, a robotic head that used facial features to express and respond to human emotions. This predecessor to social robots opened the door for future robots like Roomba and consumer-centric inventions like Alexa and other voice assistants.\n\nRobots took another leap forward in 2012 due to a breakthrough in deep learning. Armed with volumes of digital images, British AI expert Geoffrey Hinton and his team successfully trained a system of neural networks to sort over one million images while making few errors. Since then, companies have incorporated deep learning into their technologies, promising more possibilities for robotics.\n\n1700s\n\n(1737) Jacques de Vaucanson builds the first biomechanical automaton on record.

      "# [What Is Logistics? Logistics Definition and Examples.](https://builtin.com/logistics)\nWhat Is Logistics?\n\nLogistics is the process of coordinating how goods and products are obtained, stored and distributed. Manufacturers rely on logistics while overseeing complex operations in order to maintain efficiency, reduce costs and ensure that consumers’ needs are met.\n\nDue to the prominence of e-commerce companies, like Amazon, logistics embodies more than the actual movement of products from one place to another.\n\nLogistics Definition\n\nLogistics refers to the process of managing resources, including how they are transported, stored and received. Logistics often goes hand in hand with the global supply chain.\n\nAn important part of logistics is the steps taken in order to maximize customer satisfaction. This includes elements such as demand planning, order fulfillment, inventory management and customer service operations. These elements ensure that the goods consumers need are stocked and orders are fulfilled in a timely manner.\n\nLogistics management software has aided the expansion of what the logistics industry entails and how goods are brought to consumers. Some examples of software for the logistics industry include transportation management systems, enterprise resource planning software, yard management systems and warehouse management systems. The growth of this technology has created a need for specialized roles and companies focused on building and implementing logistics software.\n\nAs technology continues to transform our world, its influence on the logistics industry will only become greater, prompting a shift in how companies quickly and efficiently deliver their products to consumers.\n\nSupply Chain Management vs. Logistics\n\nSupply chain management and logistics are often thought of as one in the same, but the terms actually capture two distinct parts of what it means to move resources.\n\nSupply chain management is the larger network that connects global vendors, transportation companies, distributors and warehouses. This network functions as the framework that logistics works under.\n\nLogistics is the process companies undertake to deliver goods to consumers. This process involves purchasing and delivering materials, packaging and shipping goods as well as transporting goods and products to distributors.\n\nWhy Logistics Is Important\n\nLogistics may not be the first thing that comes to mind when a purchase is made online or in a brick-and-mortar store, but it is undeniably intertwined with everything we buy. Logistical considerations affect global supply chains, what items are in stock and when as well as where manufacturers chose to build their facilities. These influences are just one way that logistics displays importance in our global economy.\n\nUtilizing logistics properly is essential to the function of businesses across the globe — and effectively managed logistics typically leads to positive business outcomes. With the growing complexity of the global supply chain, properly implemented and managed logistics are more important than ever.\n\nThe importance of logistics also stretches to simplifying communication and reducing costs. Effective logistics help foster relationships between suppliers, shipping services and warehousers through automated systems. The connectivity of logistics improves delivery and fulfillment of orders, which in turn reduces overhead costs. Costs are also reduced by the ability to use logistical systems to purchase goods based on supply forecasts and improved inventory management.\n\nBest Logistics Companies Hiring for Open RolesView Top Logistics Companies Hiring Now\n\nTypes of Logistics\n\nThe logistics industry has transformed over the past century. During the 1960s, the supply chain was indelibly changed when IBM developed the world’s first computerized inventory management and forecasting system, which made it simpler to track orders, inventory and distribution. Since then, the industry has been propelled even further into the future, bringing with it an entirely new perspective on how we exchange goods across the globe.\n\nTypes of Logistics Companies\n\ne-Commerce logistics\n\nFreight logistics\n\nThird-party logistics\n\nCarrier logistics\n\nFreight forwarders\n\nToday, the logistics realm is heavily influenced by AI and machine learning, which many logistics companies use to offer more accurate forecasting and enhanced order management. With these technological advances and more, the supply chain has been given the chance to prosper worldwide.\n\nLogistics in e-Commerce\n\nGiven the rise of e-commerce and the rapid growth of the online ordering space, logistics has become one of the world’s fastest-growing industries. Many organizations have emerged in response to logistics’ continuous transformation, dedicated to optimizing the supply chain in unimaginable ways. Perhaps the most well-known logistics leader to have emerged over the past few decades is e-commerce giant Amazon. While Amazon was initially founded as an online marketplace for books, the company has become a household name across the globe, altering the way in which products are transported and delivered to consumers.\n\nAmazon has become famous for its logistics strategy, which is made possible by the company’s global network of distribution, sortation and fulfillment centers. Amazon’s same-day and next-day delivery model rests on a complex logistics framework. Products are delivered to the company’s fulfillment centers before being moved to sortation centers. Once goods have made it through Amazon’s sortation centers, they are loaded onto a wide range of transportation modes, which can include the company’s own fleet of delivery trucks and airplanes.\n\nThird-Party Logistics\n\nAmazon has entirely redefined the logistics landscape, yet it’s not the only major third party logistics (3PL) provider making waves. Companies like UPS and FedEx have played a significant role in the transformation of logistics. These companies are capable of transporting goods from their point of origin, warehousing products and packaging them. Working with 3PL providers offers numerous advantages for both small and large businesses including the ability to obtain better rates, easily expand into new markets and improve customer service.\n\nLogistics in Freight Shipping\n\nWhile 3PL providers are capable of handling the entirety of a company’s supply chain operations, the different components of the logistics process can be carried out by individual players. For instance, freight companies solely handle the physical transportation of goods, while freight forwarders are dedicated to optimizing transport solutions and handling necessary documentation. In this sense, logistics could be seen as a complex web of moving parts, which operate in tandem with one another in order to boost efficiency and reduce costs within the supply chain.\n\nBy way of example, Flexport has developed an operating model designed to simplify global freight forwarding, while Transfix has created a marketplace that connects shippers with a national network of carriers.\n\nRead NextFragmented Tech Is the Way Forward in Hospitality\n\nLogistic Tech Developments\n\nGiven the logistics industry’s seemingly endless transformation, logistics management is naturally made up of many different elements. These components include the planning, procurement and coordination of manufacturing materials, strategizing the development of a product and reclaiming materials and supplies involved in the manufacturing of a product. For logistics managers, keeping track of the many different aspects of a supply chain can be nearly impossible. Luckily, logistics tech has successfully reshaped the industry, turning it into a robust sector fueled by the rise of innovative new technologies.\n\nTop Logistics Tech Companies\n\nFourKites\n\nproject44\n\nMotive\n\nZipline\n\nFlexport\n\nTransfix\n\nArrive Logistics\n\nAI and Optimization in Logistics\n\nAs the demand for online delivery grows and consumers’ expectations become larger, the need to optimize logistics has never been greater. As a result, software developers have set to work creating platforms designed to make the supply chain more manageable. Real-time visibility software providers such as FourKites, project44 and FreightVerify empower supply chain operators to simply identify issues and quickly resolve them, saving organizations huge amounts of time during which they can focus on other aspects of the logistics process. Likewise, fleet management company Motive has made it easier to track cargo and drivers while improving efficiency and safety along the supply chain.\n\nConsidering all of the work that goes into Amazon’s e-commerce services, it may come as no surprise that the company relies heavily on the latest technology in order to accomplish its consumer delivery goals. Amazon has been using AI to power its product recommendations for years. The company has also adopted machine learning to build the handheld virtual assistant, Amazon Echo.\n\nWarehouse Automation in Logistics\n\nAmazon doesn’t solely use technology to maximize the customer experience. In fact, the company’s technological expertise extends to its packaging and delivery services. The e-commerce company made headlines in 2012 when it introduced automation into its supply chain upon acquiring Kiva Systems. Today, Amazon’s warehouses are filled with thousands of robots built to optimize the picking and packing process.\n\nAmazon isn’t the only logistics leader that has unlocked the potential of robotics. In fact, the warehouse automation space has grown tremendously over the past several years and is expected to become increasingly more valuable over time. The growth of this sector is attributed largely to the steady rise of e-commerce, which has ignited the need to send products out quickly while lowering operating costs. The popularity of online grocery shopping in particular has bolstered the growth of warehouse automation, as online grocery retailers have been forced to meet consumers’ ever-increasing demands while competing with brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles in Logistics\n\nAs warehouse automation continues to infiltrate the logistics industry, autonomous vehicles are becoming a supply chain essential. For companies like Amazon, self-driving vehicles are not only profitable within the warehouse, as they harbor the potential to make on-road delivery faster and more efficient. Companies like Starship Technologies are developing revolutionary new ways to autonomously transport goods, thus unleashing new possibilities within the logistics realm.\n\nDrones in Logistics\n\nAlongside the emergence of autonomous vehicles, the commercial use of drones has opened up new avenues for supply chain management. Within a warehouse setting, drones can be used for aerial inspection and can even carry out maintenance requests, all of which can save manufacturers vast amounts of time.\n\nGiven drones’ ability to quickly transport small items, many tech companies are trying their hand at developing aerial transportation modes. For instance, logistics startup Zipline has created unmanned drones designed to quickly deliver goods, reduce emissions and integrate with existing operations.\n\n3D Printing in Logistics\n\nWhile there are many options when it comes to packaging and delivering goods quickly, supply chain experts are still searching for ways to manufacture products at a speed that meet consumers’ growing expectations. For this reason, 3D printing has entered the logistics space as a possible solution. The process of gathering supplies and producing a product often requires the most time and effort within the supply chain setting.\n\nIf 3D printing were applied to the production process, consumers would have greater control over the supply chain. Potentially, a consumer could place an order for a product and then a local 3D printer shop would quickly create the product before sending it out for delivery. 3D printing could ultimately disrupt the logistics industry, as it offers manufacturers the opportunity to produce complex and customized goods faster than ever before.",

      "# [What Is Wearable Technology? Examples of Wearables](https://builtin.com/wearables)\nWhat Is Wearable Technology?\n\nIt seems like everything nowadays is a smart device. Smart toasters. Smart dog collars. Smart homes. In the age of smart, there is nothing more intelligent or more innovative than the devices being produced by the wearables industry.\n\nWearable devices help collect and analyze real-time personal data that informs us on everything from our health to our workouts. They’ve become extremely popular tools to help us stay informed and in touch with ourselves to the point that almost a quarter of people in the U.S. now sport a wearable device.\n\nWhat Are Wearables?\n\nWearables make up a broad category that includes any device worn or attached to a user’s body. Smart watches, VR headsets and wearable electrocardiograms are a few examples. These devices support purposes related to areas like health and fitness, entertainment and everyday use.\n\nWhat exactly is a wearable? Wearables are electronic devices that are worn on a person — usually close to the skin — in order to accurately relay important medical, biological and exercise data to a database.\n\nWearables have helped make the IoT industry the $594 billion dollar behemoth it is today (the wearables industry itself is expected to balloon to $111 billion by 2027). Apple Watches and Fitbits are classic examples of wearable technology, but those aren’t the only devices being developed today. In addition to smart watches, VR and AR technology, smart jackets and a wide variety of other gadgets are leading us towards a better-connected lifestyle. Each device’s main job is to collect millions of data points that range from how many steps you take to your heart rate.\n\nBenefits of Wearables\n\nThe advancement of wearables has been a welcomed tool for the insurance, healthcare and sports industries for a number of reasons. From encouraging healthier habits to optimizing physical performance, industries have reaped numerous rewards that come with wearable tech.\n\nWearables Improve Healthcare\n\nThe healthcare industry is probably seeing the biggest benefit from wearable technology. Patients who wear these smart devices can measure information ranging from body temperature to blood pressure, which is then relayed to their medical team in real-time. If something looks off, doctors have a quicker way to accurately diagnose and treat a patient. The entire treatment process is now quicker thanks to the data collected by a wearable device because doctors no longer have to run a gamut of tests to determine an illness or disease. They can reference the data collected by a wearable to quickly figure out the cause of the medical mishap.\n\nBest Wearables Companies Hiring NowView the Top Wearables Companies With Open Jobs\n\nWearables Provide More Insights Into Sports and Fitness Performance\n\nHaving all of this health data in real-time is, of course, helping the sports and fitness industries push the boundaries of training. Professional athletes from all over the world maximize their training regimes thanks to the biometric data captured through wearable technology. Elite athletes, from marathon runners to the Golden State Warriors and Liverpool FC, are using smart compression shirts to maximize every move an athlete makes. These smart shirts use a combination of GPS, accelerometers and biomedical sensors to constantly measure the performance of each athlete. Is Liverpool superstar Mo Salah taking the optimal route to a ball? Is NBA all-star Steph Curry maximizing his hydration levels to perform at his peak ability? How can MLB players, like Mike Trout or Kris Bryant, maximize their acceleration out of the batter’s box? Wearable technology is the key to answering these questions and unlocking the optimal potential of world-class athletes.\n\nWearables Increase the Productivity and Health of Workforces\n\nThe business world has benefited from the introduction of wearables to its workforce. Seventy-nine percent of employees who wear a smart device in the office report that the devices are instrumental to their work. Equipping a workforce with wearable devices makes sense for employers. These devices enhance communication, track employee activity, boost job site safety measures and can actually improve the health and quality of life for a workforce. A healthier, happier workforce will then lead to higher rates of employee retention, saving companies thousands, if not millions, of dollars annually.\n\nExamples of Wearable Technologies\n\nHealth and Fitness Wearables\n\nWearables are often associated with the health and wellness sectors. Smart watches, like a Fitbit or Apple Watch, have pioneered the way we track everything from heart rates to our daily steps. Constantly checking in with them has become part of a daily routine for many.\n\nThese watches inherently encourage healthier lifestyles because of the data they collect. Knowing how far you run encourages you to push yourself further to beat your old record. Seeing that you’re almost to your daily 10,000-step goal encourages you to go for a walk around the block. Even tracking your current sleep habits could lead to changes that help you sleep more soundly at night. In a sense, wearable tech is one of the best ways to gamify the health and wellness journey.\n\nLife Insurance Wearables\n\nIn order to promote healthier lifestyles, life insurance companies issue wearables to their customers, who then track their health data. Devices like smart watches and fitness trackers provide details on someone’s activity levels, heart rate and other important health data points. The data collected informs premium prices and can paint a more accurate picture about the overall health of life insurance customers. It’s a much more concrete method rather than relying on a vague metric, such as one’s age, when creating an individual policy.\n\nGaming Wearables\n\nGaming is one of the biggest frontiers for wearable technology. Virtual reality (VR) headsets are the most common form of wearable devices in the industry. VR headsets, like the Oculus Rift or the Playstation VR, instantly immerse gamers in other-worldly experiences from the second they strap in. Do you want to know how it would feel to fight with Lightsabers? Maybe you really want to live out your adrenaline junky dreams of racing in the Indianapolis 500? VR wearables are bringing awe-inspiring experiences like these to gamers all over the world.\n\nWearable technologies taking off in the gaming industry are haptic devices. These smart wearables provide tactile feedback to a gamer in real time. This means that a device takes advantage of a gamer’s sense of touch by providing force or vibrations to a user. To put it simply, haptic vests, gloves or suits make gaming more realistic — a gamer can now feel actual recoil after shooting their virtual weapon or can even experience real feedback of what it feels like to dribble a virtual basketball. Though still in its infancy, haptic technology is poised to make the future of gaming, and wearables, more entertaining and realistic.\n\nFashion Wearables\n\nIt only makes sense that wearable tech has started to permeate fashion culture. Athletes wear full-body suits, equipped with hundreds of little IoT sensors, to measure their every move. The data gathered will help them to better optimize their swing, shot or kick. The consumer wearable technology clothing industry is still relatively new, albeit already intriguing. Smart jackets are being made to automatically cool or warm the body based on body temperatures taken from sensors throughout the jacket. Smart rings are giving people a stylish way to track their steps or measure their sleep habits. Our pants might one day become smart enough to use the thermal energy our bodies naturally produce to charge our cell phones. Wearable devices in fashion demonstrate that tech can be smart and sophisticated all at once.\n\nTravel Wearables\n\nThe ability of smart wearables to immerse users in virtual environments has made them a vital tool for the travel industry. With VR technology, companies can provide in-depth virtual tours of hotel rooms, local landmarks and other potential destinations. People can then make more informed decisions about where they choose to stay and visit, resulting in a higher-quality travel experience for customers.\n\nMany airlines also cater to wearable devices, allowing customers to store tickets and boarding passes in a digital wallet like Apple Wallet. If someone is wearing a smart watch, they can pull up any necessary passes for a faster entry and boarding process.\n\nEducation Wearables\n\nEducation has had to adapt to the digital age, and wearable tech has helped the industry catch up with the latest developments. Smart glasses and VR headsets enable organizations to train students and employees through simulations and virtual environments. Users are immersed in a real-life scenario, allowing them to spend more time learning by doing rather than listening to a lecture or presentation.\n\nIn addition, brain sensor headbands track when someone’s mind is stressed and relaxed. Educators can leverage this device to learn when students are pushing their minds too much and teach them how to remain calm while taking in new experiences and knowledge.\n\nLogistics Wearables\n\nAnother beneficiary of wearables is the logistics industry, which relies on wearable tech to develop more efficient operations. Smart glasses like Google Glass enable warehouse workers to quickly scan barcodes, pull up information from a database and make updates along the way. This process eliminates the need for workers to keep going back to a physical computer, saving them time as they organize packages and items.\n\nSome VR glasses go as far as to help workers determine their location in a large warehouse, mapping out the optimal route to travel between two points. These glasses can also reveal the best ways to organize packages for maximized storage without crushing lighter items. All these abilities make wearable devices a must-have for logistics companies.",
      "# [A Look Into the Gaming Industry: Types of Video Games and Gaming Jobs](https://builtin.com/gaming)\nGaming Industry Overview\n\nThe gaming industry, a current $200 billion behemoth, is arguably one of the most important and innovative sectors in tech today. Its importance to culture, social networking and entertainment cannot be understated. The term “entertainment industry” is no longer reserved for Hollywood and the movie industry because gaming is now providing one of the most immersive and awe-inspiring forms of entertainment to more than three billion people around the globe.\n\nNobody could imagine what the gaming industry would blossom into when they were messing around with Pong joysticks in their basements and competing against their friends for the highest Pac-Man scores in the 1970s and ‘80s. These simple games would turn out to be the bedrock of today’s gaming industry and instant cultural phenomena.\n\nPioneered by evergrowing gaming companies, the current gaming industry is pushing the boundaries of technology to create cutting-edge and highly immersive entertainment experiences. Not only do we have the continuous advent of new consoles, PCs and devices that are putting us right into the game, but we also have the opportunity to watch some of the best gamers in the world compete in the esports arena and online through streaming platforms like Twitch and Mixer.\n\nGaming Platforms\n\nThe gaming wars of today are just heating up. The battle over console gaming is being waged by Microsoft (Xbox), Sony (Playstation) and Nintendo (Switch). These platforms are pushing the absolute boundaries of technology by offering gamers state-of-the-art graphics, speeds and processing powers.\n\nTraditional console makers, like Microsoft, will likely have to compete with cloud gaming platforms whose games available to those anywhere with any decent internet connection. Even Netflix is getting in on the gaming action. Additionally, PC gaming has opened up a world of opportunities for gamers who are looking for extra ease-of-use and dexterity when casually playing (or competing in) their favorite games.\n\nBest Gaming Companies With Open JobsView Top Gaming Companies Hiring Now\n\nEsports\n\nPicture your favorite sport. All sports, whether it’s soccer, basketball or baseball, have many things in common: passionate fans, sold-out stadiums, engaging commentators and world-class athletes. The same thing is true in the world of esports. esports athletes are essentially the Michael Jordans of their profession, but instead of dunking on opponents on a court, they’re outwitting, outmaneuvering and outplaying their opponents in virtual worlds. Thousands of screaming fans pack the arena to root on their teams who are sitting on stage clicking away for a chance at a title, while millions more watch online around the world.\n\nBy 2025, esports is projected to garner more than 640 million viewers worldwide, with about 318 million of those viewers specifically falling into the category of esports enthusiasts. With a growing fanbase that may rival any professional sport on earth, it’s no wonder that cultural icons and savvy investors, like basketball legend Michael Jordan, rapper Drake and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, all own at least partial stakes in esports teams.\n\nVideo Game Streaming\n\nStreaming has also been a massive success for the gaming industry and gamers alike. Platforms that support streaming like Twitch and Youtube Gaming give individual gamers the opportunity to livestream their in-game play to subscribers all over the world.\n\nThis innovation has allowed millions of streamers to gain a fanbase, interact with one another and monetize their gaming skills. Streaming has become uber-popular to the point where Twitch alone, the most-watched game streaming platform, garnered almost 1.5 billion minutes of watchtime in 2021. Breakout successes in the streaming industry, like Tyler “Ninja” Blevins, have been able to make upwards of $10 million a year just through the fans and endorsement deals that come with running a popular streaming profile.\n\nThe meteoric rise of the gaming industry is just getting started. Born from humble beginnings, today’s gaming sector is ready to take on any other in tech for the title of the most innovative industry. What makes gaming so special is that it’s not only immersive and entertaining, but it’s inclusive and expansive as well. There is a game and a way to play for almost every human, which makes gaming one of the most beloved industries in the world.\n\nGaming Equipment and Technology\n\nConsole Gaming\n\nConsole gaming is the original (and probably most well-known) form of digital gaming. In the early days, Nintendo and Sega dominated the market for consoles. Today, Xbox and Playstation have become the two most popular consoles, offering millions of players the ability to experience the latest in gaming technology.\n\nConsoles have been a good indicator of the tech market as a whole. In the beginning, consoles were simple joysticks just technologically-ept enough to run simple games like Pong. Now, consoles, like the new Xbox Series X, have specially designed microchips that process images and power as efficiently as possible, all the while, being designed for 8K television screens. Gaming consoles are truly pushing the limits of consumer entertainment technology.\n\nPC Gaming\n\nPCs have had a meteoric rise in gameplay with almost 1.8 billion people using computers as their gaming tool of choice by the end of 2022. Gaming computers are all about efficiency. Gaming PCs have their own dedicated RAM space, GPUs and cooling systems that help to efficiently run games in real-time. These bulked-up computers can handle graphically demanding games and can even make it easier for streamers who need a reliable system to manage gaming at a high level and livestreaming their gameplay at the same time. Games like Fortnite, League of Legends and Minecraft have made gaming one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world today.\n\nQuantum computing is a sector to look out for when it comes to gaming. Still in its infancy, quantum computing has the ability to completely upend the gaming industry (and world) as we know it. These computers dwarf anything that computers can do now, and this technology is primed to make an impact in the gaming industry. Because quantum computers have unfathomable amounts of power and information storage, they’re able to render the best graphics imaginable in real time. These computers also fix a huge problem currently plaguing the gaming industry; predictability. Who wants to play a game where they know exactly what happens? A quantum computer’s massive storage of algorithms could actually make gaming unpredictable and unique for each gamer.\n\nBest E-Sports Companies With Open RolesView Top E-Sports Companies Hiring Now\n\nCloud Gaming\n\nCloud gaming is the newest type of video game technology making headlines. Imagine Netflix, but for gaming. You scroll through a library of games, choose which game you want and automatically start playing the game. No discs and no load times. Play on your phone, iPad or console. Cloud-based gaming platforms aim to make the whole gaming experience seamless and easy to play from anywhere at any time.\n\nCloud gaming is such a threat to traditional console gaming that Microsoft’s head of gaming, Phil Spencer, stated that Xbox is no longer concerned about competition from Nintendo or Playstation in 2020. Rather, they’re more focused on competing with the ultra-fast cloud platforms being hosted by companies like Amazon and Google. It is worth noting, however, that Google’s cloud-based gaming platform, Stadia, is shutting down in 2023.\n\nVR/AR Gaming\n\nVirtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are meant to put you right in the middle of the action. Instead of playing from a third person point-of-view, VR drops people into computer-generated environments to make them feel like they’re actually part of the game. VR offers gamers the ability to step into magical worlds and do everything from kick around a soccer ball to fight off hordes of monsters (like in the video above). Additionally, being directly a part of these kinds of digital worlds has made the draw to the metaverse that more appealing.\n\nAugmented reality, on-the-other-hand, adds digital influences to real life. A popular example of AR in gaming is the mobile game Pokémon Go, in which smartphone cameras are used to find and capture virtual creatures in the real world. Gamers might come across a Pikachu in the park or even find a Wartortle on their walk to work.\n\nWhether our reality is augmented or virtual, it’s clear to see that technology is ushering in a completely new way to participate in, and enjoy, video games.\n\nMobile Gaming\n\nMobile gaming makes up about 45 percent of the total market share of the gaming industry with over half of the worldwide population projected to play a mobile game by 2027.\n\nWhy is mobile gaming so popular? It’s easily accessible and has games for every type of gamer. Instead of having to strap on a headset or pop a disc into a console, mobile gaming allows us to play wherever we go and whenever we want. In 2020, it took over television as the preferred choice of leisure activity with people spending more than 6.5 hours per week on mobile games.\n\nThe mobile gaming industry is poised for continual growth as investments in mobile gaming startups have skyrocketed, and creativity opens up avenues for more gamers to enjoy different types of exciting games.\n\nMore On GamingWhat Does the Future of Gaming Look Like?\n\nPopular Gaming Jobs\n\nTypes of Gaming Jobs\n\nVideo game designer\n\nVideo game programmer\n\nVideo game animator\n\nVideo game quality assurance (QA) tester\n\nVideo Game Designer\n\nThat incredibly intricate, expansive and beautifully designed game you’re playing didn’t just appear out of thin air. It took a team of extraordinarily talented video game designers months, even years, to create all the dimensions that a user encounters when playing a game. These designers go through several prototypes of the game before rendering the final, customer-facing version. This requires an ability to be focused and resilient, as well as, an extensive background knowledge of game design techniques, tools and skills.\n\nGame design, especially at the highest level, usually requires a bachelor’s or master’s degree with a vast knowledge in everything from 3D animation to graphic design and even physics. The job outlook for game design looks really steady because of the enormous rise in console, PC and mobile gaming. Cities like Los angeles, New York and Chicago employ the most designers, and a video game designer can make an average of $42,900 a year.\n\nMore On Game Design18 Video Game Design Courses to Know\n\nVideo Game Programmer\n\nVideo game programmers are some of the most sought-after individuals in the gaming industry. They’re the people who bring a designer’s work to life through code. A good video game would be nothing without the hard work of a programmer, who ensures that characters, missions and environments are supposed to interact the way they were intended. Most game programmers usually have at least a bachelor’s degree, but all need a vast competence of C++ (and other languages) in order to thrive.\n\nGaming’s popularity has caused a boom in industry hiring for programmers and it’s not projected to slow down. Job growth isn’t the only positive aspect about being a game programmer. The salary is too.\n\nThe median salary for software developers, which can encompass computer programming and digital design, is more than $109,000 annually. This puts programmers up there with some of the most well-paid positions in the U.S.\n\nVideo Game Animator\n\nYou can’t have a high quality game without video game animators. Game animators combine technology and art to create the interactive images and sequences that help tell the story of the game. Animators work closely with designers and programmers to make sure that a game’s environment interacts in a way that is natural, fun and helps to progress the game. Animators start every project with a basic storyboard, then help bring that story to life through a series of intricate animations. Animators usually have an extensive background in multimedia knowledge, as well as a degree in a field like computer graphics or animation.\n\nThe video game animation field is projected to grow by about 16 percent until 2030, meaning animators can expect to see a healthy salary. On a median salary, animators can expect a value of around $79,000.\n\nVideo Game Testing and Quality Assurance (QA)\n\nGetting paid to play video games might be the ultimate dream job. Luckily, video game testers (better known as video game quality assurance testers) get paid to play, but more importantly, break, video games. Game QA testers push the work of designers, programmers and animators to the limits to ensure that games are free of bugs and allow for gamers to have the freedom to explore in these virtual environments. Testers usually run through what is called matrix testing, where they have to test every permutation and combination of events that could possibly happen in a game to ensure that nothing can break it.\n\nThere are really no essential educational credentials to have when it comes to QA testing video games. However, these testers need to have an eye for details, a tolerance for repetition and an intense passion for the gaming industry. Video game testers are in demand right now (especially in mobile gaming) due to the rapid increase of games being produced. Game and QA testers on average make around $55,000 annually.",
      "# [What Is Marketing? Basics of Marketing & Types](https://builtin.com/marketing)\nWhat Is Marketing?\n\nMarketing is one of, if not the, most important aspects of a business. What good is selling a life-changing product if customers have never heard of it and don’t know anything about it? That’s where capable marketers come in handy. Marketers help companies identify consumer and industry trends, formulate campaigns and captivate audiences by showing how their products shine over others.\n\nWhat, exactly, is marketing? Simply put, marketing is the activity of getting people aware of and interested in a brand and its products, often by promoting its offerings so that customers perceive them as valuable or desirable.\n\nWhat Do Marketers Do?\n\nMarketing is the process of designing, positioning, promoting and distributing a product or service in such a way that consumers see value in it. The role of marketers is often to increase brand awareness and loyalty, attract new customers and retain existing ones, ultimately driving more sales revenue for their company.\n\nWhether we’re conscious of it or not, marketing is all around us. Billboards along a highway, commercials on TV, advertisements in magazines, brand posts on social media and optimized content on a website are all everyday examples of marketing.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of marketing is Nike’s slogan “Just Do It.” Pairing “Just Do It” with world-class athlete spokespeople has proven to be one of the most effective marketing campaigns of the last 30 years. The phrase resonates with competitive athletes and fosters a sense of pushing yourself to be a better athlete (in your Nike gear, of course).\n\nOne of the reasons why marketing is so heavily emphasized is that it often helps inform other aspects of the business. Product, sales and advertising teams are all affected by the efforts of a marketing team. Marketers are responsible for guiding the decisions of these teams with valuable insights, so they compile data in the form of market research.\n\nMarket research entails gathering information about a business’ key demographics, their affinity toward a company’s current products and what other competitors are doing. A marketing team’s in-depth market research informs product and engineering teams on what to create, sales teams on what to sell and advertising teams on what to communicate.\n\nWhy Is Marketing Important?\n\nMarketing is a core component of business success because it impacts a company’s ability to reach customers, develop a brand and generate revenue.\n\nBenefits of Marketing\n\nEstablish a customer base\n\nDevelop a trustworthy brand\n\nAdd value to company products\n\nGenerate higher sales profits\n\nMarketing serves as a lifeline that connects brands to potential customers. Market research enables teams to determine who their target audience is and tailor their messaging and communications accordingly. Businesses can then generate positive perception within consumers who are most likely to find value in and buy their products.\n\nOver time, a well-planned marketing strategy solidifies a company’s brand and messaging. This is crucial because consistent branding tells consumers what to expect from a company and leads to a reputation. If a business can continue to meet these expectations and live up to its reputation, it can create trust among loyal customers and add value to its brand in the eyes of consumers.\n\nThe ultimate reward for these efforts is higher sales, and some of the most effective brands have become synonymous with winning and success. For example, many customers will pay more for a Nike shoe than an anonymous brand’s shoe based on the reputation of the Nike brand alone. An ideal brand highlights what makes a company unique, setting it apart from competitors and transforming its products into coveted items among consumers.\n\nThe 4 Ps of Marketing\n\nThe 4 Ps of marketing is a popular framework for understanding the areas involved in marketing strategy. Sometimes known as the marketing mix, the four Ps of marketing — product, price, place and promotion — are vital to every good marketing campaign.\n\n1. Product\n\nProduct is the good or service that the company is offering. Quality products should be able to satisfy customer needs, while also being able to satisfy customer demand. To effectively market a product, marketers need to pinpoint the value it brings to the customer and why customers would want it. The marketing team can start working on campaigns once these, and many other, questions are answered.\n\n2. Price\n\nPrice is obviously a large factor into whether a consumer buys your product or goes to a competitor. Good marketing teams rely on industry research to appropriately price their products so they boost their market share and reach more happy customers.\n\n3. Place\n\nIt’s critical that marketing professionals take place — both digital and physical — into account when marketing a product. Is a certain product more marketable in-store or online? Should you sell a certain product internationally? How do you market to certain geographical locations? How much does a location’s culture affect your marketing abilities? Marketing teams need to be hyper-aware of where they’re marketing to truly optimize their efforts.\n\n4. Promotion\n\nWhat good is a marketing effort if there isn’t some excitement and build-up around a product? Promotion includes the advertising, promotional strategy and public relations surrounding a product. “Should we create a commercial?” “Should we sponsor a podcast?” “Should we just run a Google Adwords campaign?” With some help from market research, marketing executives should be able to know when to target their audience and through which medium. Executing the promotion step of the marketing mix is vital because it helps to build fervor for a product and brand awareness.\n\nTypes of Marketing\n\nMarketing isn’t just a one-size-fits-all effort. There are different types of marketing campaigns depending on where an organization’s customers spend their time and how they prefer to be reached. Below are eight popular types of marketing:\n\nTypes of Digital Marketing\n\nSocial Media Marketing\n\nSocial media marketing involves the use of social media channels (like Instagram, Twitter and YouTube) to build a brand, connect with customers, drive website traffic and increase sales. These platforms have proven to be excellent marketing tools because they have the ability to educate customers on products, individualize consumer social media experiences and engage with an audience in a way that wasn’t possible before. Marketers rely on data analytics tools to develop targeted ads and timely posts that increase social media engagement with brands and boost revenue.\n\nContent Marketing\n\nContent marketing focuses on creating relevant, interesting and valuable content that attracts an audience and converts them into customers. Marketers are turning to this form of content because it boosts SEO traffic and increases both the quantity and quality of customers. A clever content marketing example is Coca Cola’s “Share a Coke” campaign. The company labeled its iconic bottles and cans with popular names to build stronger bonds with customers. The experiment was such a resounding success in Australia that it ended up being implemented in 80 countries worldwide.\n\nInfluencer Marketing\n\nInfluencer marketing is a type of social media marketing that relies on the virality and popularity of social media influencers, who are paid to promote and endorse products. Essentially, companies pay social media accounts with a large following to include their product in an Instagram, Snapchat or even Facebook post. Influencer marketing has proven profitable for both the company and the influencer. The company potentially gets millions of views of their product and the influencer gets paid. For example, to reach Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s 340 million Instagram followers, companies need to pay about $1 million per post.\n\nSEO Marketing\n\nHave you ever wondered how a search engine picks its search results for your specific query? How does it know what to choose at the top option? Much of that has to do with search engine optimization (SEO). SEO is the practice of increasing unpaid (known as organic) traffic through a variety of technical and content-related practices that make it easier for a search engine to read, understand and rank a site. Optimizing a site’s content, photos or backend procedures provides an uncluttered and efficient experience for both a user and a search engine, resulting in higher rankings. The higher rankings provided by this free method of marketing boosts traffic and converts a casual audience into loyal customers.\n\nTypes of Traditional Marketing\n\nPrint Marketing\n\nPrint marketing involves marketers reaching out to target audiences through offline formats. Brochures, informative flyers and mail advertisements are a few examples of print marketing that marketers hand out or deliver to the homes of consumers. Businesses may also try to reach wider audiences by placing ads in magazines, newspapers and other publications. While marketing teams focus on producing concise written content, they must also determine how to pair text with visuals. The most effective print marketing materials complement engaging writing with relevant images, branded color schemes and other eye-catching elements.\n\nBillboard Marketing\n\nBillboard marketing is another way to expose more consumers to a brand and features content on larger physical surfaces. Consumers can find these kinds of advertisements in crowded areas like Times Square, along popular highways or on the walls of buildings. Some companies may pay for mobile billboards, placing ads on the sides of trucks or public transportation vehicles. All billboards follow the same principles of print marketing, combining written content with coordinated color schemes, images and other visuals. Marketing teams need to get creative with billboards, such as applying bold colors or humorous content, since drivers and passersby may only have a few moments to take in a message.\n\nEvent Marketing\n\nEvent marketing relies on both company-sponsored and public events where a business can have conversations with customers and spread its brand through physical materials. Examples of company-sponsored events include hosting a conference or learning convention. Organizations may also join public events, such as setting up a booth at a local community arts fest. Companies should supply marketing teams with materials like tents, banners and flyers for interested individuals. If possible, it’s also helpful to have a sample of a product for consumers to view. Each event provides an opportunity for marketers to share information with consumers and answer any questions, spreading their company’s brand and earning new customers.\n\nProduct Marketing\n\nProduct marketing is vital to the success of a new product launch and is applicable across many industries. Even before the product is built, these marketers are doing intense market research to ensure that the product is the right fit for a company’s customers and that it serves a useful purpose. Then, the product team will use the product marketer’s insights as a guide on what to include in the new product. As the product is being built, the marketer will arm the sales team with the necessary knowledge and materials that will help them sell the product to current customers and reach out to new audiences. After a launch, the product marketer will ensure that customers aren’t having adoption issues and will craft marketing materials to make sure that the product stays relevant as time goes on.\n\nHow to Get Into Marketing\n\nMarketing is a unique field, filled with people who are analytical, yet have an in-depth understanding of human psychology and storytelling. Companies all over the world need competent marketers as more and more products are developed. Who best to evangelize a product other than the people who have the most knowledge about the industry? If you think that mixing analytics with storytelling sounds intriguing, then a career path in marketing might be for you.\n\nThis is the perfect time to get into a marketing role. It’s expected that the advertising and marketing industry will eclipse $786 billion by 2026. Digital marketing has taken on a larger role, with click-and-display ads becoming popular tools for marketers.\n\nMarketing Education Requirements\n\nMost marketing jobs require at least a bachelor’s degree in marketing, journalism, graphic design or a similar major. This shows hiring managers that you have a firm marketing background right away. Of course, having a degree isn’t the only way to break into the industry. There are plenty of reputable courses and bootcamps that can help you become a quality job candidate (or to learn more if you’re already in the industry).\n\nMarketing Career Path\n\nThere are a few career paths that can be taken. In a more traditional marketing sense, newcomers normally start out as marketing coordinators and then work their way up to marketing manager, marketing director and then CMO.\n\nDigital marketers have more options when it comes to roles and paths to take. These marketers usually start out as coordinators and can then experience roles like marketing specialist, search engine marketing manager, social media manager, or marketing director on their way to a CMO or VP of Marketing role. New job titles and responsibilities have been constantly popping up over the last few years due to the advent of new, groundbreaking technologies in the marketing field.\n\nMarketing Career Paths\n\nThere are many important roles that make up a marketing team because of the sector’s importance to the overall goals of a company.

      "# [What Is Consumer Technology? A Guide](https://builtin.com/consumer-tech)\nA Brief History of Consumer Tech\n\nConsumer technology is the umbrella term for any type of technology created with the general public’s use in mind. Think TVs, toaster ovens, smartphones and fitness apps.\n\nConsumer tech can be traced back to the 19th century, when early tech pioneers like David Edward Hughes, Heinrich Rudolph Hertz, Nikola Tesla and Jagadish Edward Bose manipulated electricity for widespread use throughout the world. Indeed, much of the consumer tech we still interact with daily was invented during this period of innovation set between the end of the 19th century and the mid-20th century, including computers (first developed between 1940-45), transistor radios (introduced in 1954) and the microwave oven (1946).\n\nTechnology has continued to develop over time, improving and creating products that are thousands of times more capable than predecessors while enabling form factors to shrink and prices to decrease — creating a technological revolution with the power to reshape our world. Computers, for instance, were once an exclusive product and would require an entire room to store just a few megabytes. Today, powerful computers exist in the pockets of 85 percent of Americans in the form of smartphones, capable of housing hundreds of gigabytes of data with unlimited amounts of cloud space available at all times.\n\nIn another few decades, the advances in consumer tech might be unfathomable to us today.\n\nConsumer Tech Companies\n\nAlphabet (Google)\n\nApple\n\nIntel\n\nSamsung\n\nSony\n\nTesla\n\nWhirlpool\n\nYamaha\n\nConsumer Tech Vs. High Tech\n\nWhile consumer tech typically refers to general-audience-oriented technology like lightbulbs, calculators, cell phones or televisions, high-tech products are slightly different. High tech, or advanced technology, can be thought of as the most cutting-edge forms of technology available, and sometimes refers to the newest type of technology on the market.\n\nOne example of high technology is autonomous mobile robotsthat help package goods. High-tech products such as autonomous vehicles can be used by the general public but are less common than consumer technology products like a microwave or bluetooth sound system.\n\nRead NextBye, Middleman: These Are the Trends Shaping E-Commerce Right Now\n\nTechnology has evolved to better meet and fulfill the needs of people, and as a result, people are now constantly interacting with consumer technology products. Several categories and subcategories of customer technology exist, with plenty of overlap.\n\nTypes of Consumer Technology\n\nAppliances\n\nSmart devices\n\nFitness wearables\n\nSelf-driving cars\n\nVideo game consoles and devices\n\nDrones\n\nComputer software\n\nAs more products are introduced at conferences like the Consumer Electronics Show, these categories will inevitably expand. There are hundreds of categories that could be listed here and products will continue to hit the market as technology evolves. Some of today’s most notable consumer tech categories include:\n\n5G Devices\n\nDevices connected to 5G networks — or 4G, LTE or any other form of cellular network — are able to receive network signals from cellular towers and provide users with online connectivity. Many of the most common forms of consumer electronics fall into this category, including smartphones, tablets and portable hotspots.\n\nIoT Devices\n\nInternet of Things, or IoT, devices connect to specific applications via the internet or other forms of wireless networks for unparalleled user visibility and control. Some common consumer tech products in the IoT devices category included smart home appliances, such as app-controlled thermostats, locks and lights, sensor-based products like doorbells with cameras set to alert users to movement, and various Bluetooth devices.\n\nComputers\n\nIn recent years, computers’ capabilities have increased while their costs have decreased. And everyday people use them for all sorts of reasons — work, gaming, video streaming, internet browsing and more. Laptops, desktops, tablets, gaming computers, video game consoles, smartphones, hard drives and several other types of devices fall into this consumer tech category.\n\nSelf-Driving and Electric Vehicle Consumer Tech\n\nSince their emergence in the early 20th century, cars and motor vehicles of all kinds have grown to become one of the most critical forms of consumer tech to most societies around the world. As technology has improved, so have cars, with vehicles now commonly possessing high-tech features such as built-in GPS, self-driving capabilities, automatic braking, lane sensors, rearview cameras, power steering, and a bevy of additional online and offline capabilities that enhance both safety and comfort. Electric vehicles have eliminated the need for wasteful natural gas resources and self-driving cars are on the rise.\n\nTelevisions and Smart Screens\n\nTelevision became a cultural phenomenon in the mid-20th century and its status has since become cemented as a focal point of modern society. The average American adult watches three hours of television per day, as of 2022. TV and smart screens have been bolstered by the many advancements that the near-century old medium has undergone. Today’s top-end “smart TVs” come loaded with WiFi/5G capabilities, built-in applications, internet search capabilities, built-in gaming features, computer monitoring and more.\n\nSmart Speakers\n\nLeading consumer tech companies like Amazon and Google have introduced a variety of home speakers with built-in virtual assistant technology. These speakers possess internet connectivity and can play music, look up information, place orders and complete a variety of additional tasks by linking to existing accounts. Three of the most popular smart speakers are the Amazon Echo, Apple HomePod and Google Home.\n\nAppliances\n\nHome appliances are a form of consumer tech products that allow people to live easier, more fulfilling lives. From microwave ovens and various kitchen appliances to laundry machines, space heaters and more, appliances of some kind can be found in a majority of homes worldwide.\n\nFitness and Wearables\n\nFitness and consumer tech have merged in seamless fashion, with people embracing devices that track their daily fitness goals and keep them engaged in their activities and workouts. Wearables expand beyond fitness, however, with devices and technology hitting the market that filter air, keep users temperate, alert the proper parties when in danger or in need of help, and much more. Wearable consumer tech includes smartwatches, fitness trackers, heart rate monitors, 911-alerting devices and tech-enabled clothing.\n\nGaming\n\nThe video gaming industry has exploded since its rise through the late 1970s and the 1980s. Today’s systems possess the processing capabilities that would have been unfathomable to game designers back in those days, such as 5K graphics, online gameplay and lightning-fast processor speeds. Video gaming consoles, games, software, VR devices, gaming computers, handheld consoles, add-ons, and accessories are all included in this category.\n\nDrones and Robotics\n\nDrones have been in military use since the 20th century, with commercial and consumer drones hitting the market in the early 21st century. Consumer drones have the ability to take photos, record videos and deliver packages at previously unreachable heights and distances, produced in a variety of form factors and with many accessories for customizing personal drone experiences.\n\nAudio and Music Consumer Tech\n\nSome consumers, whether audiophiles or musicians, take sound very seriously. This category is meant to address that, creating technologically advanced solutions that help them dial in the perfect sound response to their ears, in real time. Multi-room sound systems, Bluetooth speakers, amplifiers, interfaces, microphones, instruments and software all fall into this category of consumer tech.\n\nPhotography\n\nThe first cameras emerged in the late 19th century, since then, photography equipment has embraced digital and technological advancements to unlock capabilities like faster shutter speeds, faster lens speeds, 5K video capturing, low-light shooting and much more. Photography consumer tech includes camera bodies, lenses, sensors, hard drives, memory cards, flash units and additional accessories.\n\nDelivery Consumer Tech\n\nDelivery apps and food delivery platforms have become an integral part of people’s lives. Delivery services use several facets of technology to bring products right to our doors. This industry could not exist without the right software, mobile technology and vehicles.\n\nSoftware\n\nMuch of the consumer tech that people interact with is not a physical product but software that writes the rules to allow hardware to function. Software is responsible for enabling nearly all forms of consumer tech products to work and interact, from menu screens to full-on computer programs.\n\nRelated ReadingProptech: Everything You Need to Know (With 25 Examples)",
      "# [What Is Cryptanalysis? (Definition, Types, Goals) by Anthony Corbo on 2023-01-03](https://builtin.com/articles/cryptanalysis)\nCryptanalysis is the study and discovery of vulnerabilities within cryptographic algorithms that can be used to decrypt ciphertext without knowledge of the secret key. Several forms of cryptanalysis can be used to attack cryptographic messages, ranging from the interception of messages within unsecured communication channels to the matching of plaintext based on the same algorithm techniques. Cryptanalysis also includes measures taken to stop attackers from decoding cryptographic algorithms.\n\nMore From Built In ExpertsHow to Break Into Cybersecurity\n\nTypes of Cryptanalysis\n\nThere are three generic forms of cryptanalysis: ciphertext-only, known ciphertext/plaintext pairs and chosen plaintext or chosen ciphertext.\n\nIn ciphertext-only cryptanalysis, the attacker has the ciphertext available to them for decoding. In known ciphertext/plaintext pair cryptanalysis, attackers will know some element of the plaintext and will be able to match likely elements of the ciphertext to the known plaintext. For example, a computer session may begin with “LOG IN.”\n\nDeciphering this string of text will also allow the attacker to decrypt plaintext that matches the deciphered ciphertext throughout the message. Chosen plaintext or chosen ciphertext cryptanalysis occurs when the attacker unwittingly causes either the transmitter to encrypt plaintext or the receiver to decrypt ciphertext. This provides the attacker with an abundance of knowledge, possibly even knowledge of the entire message’s contents.\n\nWhat Is the Primary Goal of Cryptanalysis?\n\nCryptanalysis is used to understand the contents of protected or encrypted messages and data in order to gain access to either in-transit or at-rest data. Attackers using cryptanalysis may have several goals for doing so, but the ultimate goal is always some degree of cryptographic decryption through either the ciphertext or plain text.\n\nSome specific goals associated with cryptanalysis include a total break (the locating of the secret key), global deduction (the locating of a functionally equivalent algorithm for encryption and decryption without knowledge of the secret key), information deduction (the acquiring of a portion of information about the plaintext or ciphertext that was not previously known), and the distinguishing of the algorithm (giving the attacker the ability to determine the encryption’s output from a random selection of plaintext).\n\nMore From the Built In Tech DictionaryWhat Is a DDoS Attack?\n\nWhat Does a Cryptanalyst Do?\n\nCryptanalysts can be hired to find security weaknesses, potential data leak causes, discover evidence from encrypted messages and more.\n\nCryptanalysts are often associated with government agencies or law enforcement, hired to ensure agency encryption methods are up to par with the current standards in cybersecurity and engage in the deciphering of encrypted messages. Cryptanalysts do this by purposefully exploiting weaknesses so fixes can be applied. As mentioned, government organizations often employ cryptanalysts to decipher encrypted communications and law enforcement agencies will hire cryptanalysts to decode encrypted messages within evidence or testify as experts on a case.\n\nRegardless of their industry or ethics, cryptanalysts must have a strong understanding of mathematics, ciphers, codes, and encryption systems, with daily responsibilities including analyzing intelligence information, diagnosing weaknesses within cryptographic algorithms, developing new cryptanalysis tools and more.",

We do have an Indeed account and LinkedIn, but I am also looking for cheap (read as cheap as possible) avenues to post jobs. \n\n\n\n## Comment ID k87w4xz with +103 score by [(If-By-Whisky, Reddit, 2023-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/17pu8l3/other_than_indeed_where_do_yall_find_jobs_from/k87w4xz/) (in reply to ID 17pu8l3):\nIt could be specific to my industry, but I had way more luck networking than with applying to posted jobs. I got my current job by finding a company I wanted to work for, cold-emailing someone at the company who went to my same undergrad, and basically asked him for career advice. Did that like 10-15 times before it worked though.\n\nEdit: just wanted to add a couple of related pointers: (1) Any connection with the person will work. Doesn’t need to be that you went to the same college. Could be same hometown, etc. LinkedIn, Google (using the advanced search function), and company bios are your friends here. (2) Some jobs are posted even though the company already has a candidate in mind. Might be for DEI reasons, or maybe they want to say “we had 100 applicants apply for this one job!” This is where networking really helps out, because they might consider you before the job is even posted. (3) Job hunting is a numbers game. I literally applied to 84 jobs during my first search. Keep a spreadsheet to organize your search.\n\n### Comment ID k883u3z with +5 score by [(throwaway2929839392, Reddit, 2023-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/17pu8l3/other_than_indeed_where_do_yall_find_jobs_from/k883u3z/) (in reply to ID k87w4xz):\nWhat’s your industry?

Frame it like “I’m interested in what you do and would like to learn more. Do you have a few minutes for a zoom chat/coffee/etc?” They’ll know what’s up and even if they’re not hiring, maybe they will be in the future and the person might remember you.\n\n#### Comment ID k883yvp with +7 score by [(ennuiui, Reddit, 2023-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/17pu8l3/other_than_indeed_where_do_yall_find_jobs_from/k883yvp/) (in reply to ID k87w88k):\nThe takeaway here might be to look for industry specific meetup groups as an avenue to reach potential applicants (assuming that in-person meetups are still a thing in the post-covid world).  Contact the organizer and ask if you can give a 2 minute plug for your job listings.  Or step up the game and offer to host a meet up for a more captive audience.\n\n### Comment ID k88850r with +8 score by [(8dtfk, Reddit, 2023-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/17pu8l3/other_than_indeed_where_do_yall_find_jobs_from/k88850r/) (in reply to ID k87w4xz):\nThis … is what networking done properly looks like\n\n#### Comment ID k8droof with +1 score by [(AmigoDelDiabla, Reddit, 2023-11-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/17pu8l3/other_than_indeed_where_do_yall_find_jobs_from/k8droof/) (in reply to ID k88850r):\nIt's so funny to hear `average redditor` shit on networking as being disingenuous, fake, or something only the privileged have access to.\n\nYou're absolutely right:  this is how networking can be done effectively by anyone.

Or so I thought.\n\nThen, when I got hired at that company, my hiring manager explained to me that he hired me not because of my perceived understanding of their products, but because my skills and experience aligned with what they were looking for in that junior role. He then went on to explain to me that the applicant-facing product I had studied was just the tip of the iceberg because:\n\n1. **I only saw/experienced about 15% of this product.** The version of it I used appeared relatively static to me, as the user. But in reality, there was a lot of conditional logic on the back end that determined which questions I saw and which materials were required/optional/not asked based on things in my profile, the way I answered questions in other parts of the application, based on which type of device I accessed the application on, etc.\n2. **Though the most well-known product from this company was their applicant-facing product, there were about 6 other products that this UX role would be working on that were either B2B or strictly internal.** Things like configuration software, administration software, client support software, software for managing client implementations and integrations of our products, etc. etc. **There was essentially no (legal) way for me to have known that, nor to have accessed those products if I did somehow know that.**\n\nMy whole point with this lengthy comment is that you should be focusing (as the other commenters said) on how well your skill and experience align with what is being asked on the job description, and understand/expect that no matter how much time and work you put into getting to know a company's products, the reality of the situation is that you can never fully know until you work there how well you actually know their products.\n\n### Comment ID hqi12b6 with +1 score by [(Internet-Citizen, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqi12b6/) (in reply to ID hqhycbm):\nAnything for the UK?\n\n#### Comment ID hqi2sdi with +1 score by [(UXette, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqi2sdi/) (in reply to ID hqi12b6):\nDon't have anything, unfortunately\n\n#### Comment ID hqpn1jv with +1 score by [(UXette, Reddit, 2021-12-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqpn1jv/) (in reply to ID hqi12b6):\nThis site has a few UK postings: https://www.ideatelabs.co/job-board\n\n### Comment ID hqjqzpe with +1 score by [(Designflystretwerguy, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqjqzpe/) (in reply to ID hqhycbm):\nMdeng is a solid resource I would also follow him\nOn LinkedIn he promotes many internship and entry level roles.\n\n#### Comment ID i9djf1z with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/i9djf1z/) (in reply to ID hqjqzpe):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID hqixx6w with +10 score by [(TheComicSansKiller, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqixx6w/) (in reply to ID rroldx):\nFollow UXers on LinkedIn, leaders, managers, directors and so on.

Spamming resumes and applying to everything isn't a good general rule.  It isn't a good use of your time and it really gets you nowhere.  As someone who led a large design team and did over 70 interviews one year from hundreds of resumes, the carpet bombing approach might work for smaller startups but not for larger orgs.  You'll get lost in the noise.\n\nThat said, building connections is critical.  Make connections.  I don't mean spamming the connect button on LinkedIn, I mean sending a meaningful message - it will make you stand out.   You won't get a ton of replies but it makes you memorable.  Ideally not half assed but even half assed can be ok. So for instance sending a LinkedIn connection with the stock message = bad.  Sending one with a personal, unique but half-assed message = better.  Sending one with a hand tailored message that showed you researched the individual and their company = golden.\n\nSo for example, sending one that says \"hey, would love to connect, your experience with  doing UX for APIs is really interesting.\" is good.  Better is saying something like, \"Hey, would love to connect, your creation of a design system at YOURCOMPANY sounds really challenging, I've been studying how to improve communication of design tokens to designers and would love to chat about it with you some time.\"  This is why spamming doesn't work - start to get interested in specific things, take a deep dive - you don't have to commit to it for life but showing interest in a subject area makes you interesting to other people as well. Then find people who resonate with that subject.\n\n#### Comment ID hqkrxnl with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqkrxnl/) (in reply to ID hqjmu6k):\nYeah if you want to PM me go for it!!\n\n#### Comment ID hqksfeh with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqksfeh/) (in reply to ID hqjmu6k):\nBtw when I say apply, apply, apply,  I don’t mean spam. what I mean is, if it’s a job you want, a company you’re interested in, etc. apply, don’t be afraid.

So I don't know about the process of applying, but I can say that working for one has been very useful for learning. A government agency isn't driven by profit, so deadlines are lenient. They are also bound by their budget so they often can't afford the expensive senior designers, so I don't think it's uncommon for them to look for juniors, at least not in my country. Not all of them know about the benefits of UX though and might not be looking for one for that reason alone. However, having responsive and accessible websites is becoming more important for governments since excluding people with disabilities from a public service isn't legal. So it's not crazy to assume that some of them might be in dire need of some UX! Might be worth looking into.\n\n### Comment ID hqjnnqu with +2 score by [(DevelopMatt, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqjnnqu/) (in reply to ID hqj7fv8):\nNoted.

What I would emphasise is focus on creating a body of good work, and on top of that, networking, instead of cold applying  \n\n\nAll I had when I started was 1 *very good school project* that I worked my ass off on. When I say good I mean in the sense that \"client loved it, it got the highest possible grade, the professor wanted my group to write a paper about it\" - I made it the centerpiece of my portfolio when applied for an internship.  \n\n\nEnd of my first semester I saw a tweet from the head of a studio in my city while my exams were going on at my university, where I was studying my Master’s in Design. I was interested, so I looked a bit more at their website, and saw that they were a design studio that seemed working on some really cool problems!  \n\n\nI reached out to him with a sample of some work that I did and we had a call, where I wanted to learn more about the opportunities that were available.As I had my end of semester break, I realised that maybe I could come for 10 days as a quick “preview” and work on a small aspect of a problem. It would be a win-win situation. They would get some work that was of value to them, while I would gain experience and some stuff that would go on my portfolio (and be paid too)!  \n\n\nI proposed this over the call, and to my surprise and delight, he was interested. He discussed some projects they was working on, and later that day I sent a proposal outlining my various ideas for things that I could contribute to. I worked hard on the proposal, made a case for xyz thing and explained the different ideas I had.  \n\n\nI joined and impressed them enough that they called me back in the summer after my first year, and they offered me a job once my master's got over. I would have probably had zero luck had I waited till my master's was over and applied through their careers page, like everyone else.  \n\n\nI worked for a year there then they got battered by the pandemic so I went in-house at the ad-tech division of a tech company.\n\n### Comment ID hqplp60 with +1 score by [(DevelopMatt, Reddit, 2021-12-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqplp60/) (in reply to ID hqnf8ms):\nGreat story!

Until you have some experience under your belt all you can do is convey what you know and who you are as a person. I believe the best way to do that is still in person. I got my first few jobs in the industry by impressing people at meetups who then told their teams they should hire me. \n\nUnfortunately, the global pandemic makes that a lot harder these days but I would recommend looking up local meetup groups / industry happy hours and local chapters of of groups like IxDA, UXPA, etc. My local groups still do online events about once a month and occasionally do in person during the better Covid times. If there aren’t any in your area I would look into UX discord or slack channels.\n\n### Comment ID hqk7cnc with +1 score by [(DevelopMatt, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqk7cnc/) (in reply to ID hqk4osy):\nGreat points!

Then you could personally pick up a hardcopy or they would give me a code to access the content online.  \n\nAll of that information is available to the public.

As someone who's been a fractional CEO for several startups, I've got some insider tips for finding the right opportunities. While the usual job boards are good, here's what actually works better:\n\n\n\n1. Check out startup accelarators in your area - they often have portfolio companies looking for talent but don't advertise widely\n\n2. Join local startup slack communities - lots of founders hang out there and post opportunities before they go public\n\n3. Look up recent seed funding announcements on TechCrunch or Crunchbase - these companies usually hire aggressively right after funding\n\n4. Network at startup-focused coworking spaces - many early-stage companies work from these spots\n\n\n\nThe key is to focus on companies that raised money in the last 3-6 months. They've got cash to hire but haven't fully built their teams yet. This stage is perfect for getting real hands-on experience.\n\n\n\nAlso, quick tip: smaller startups (like 5-15 people) usually give you way more responsibility than bigger ones. You'll learn tons because you'll wear multiple hats. Just make sure they have enough funding to keep running for at least 18 months.",

Make a list of companies you want to work for, regardless of whether they currently have an appropriate job opening for you. Consult your network to see if you know anyone who works there, or who might know someone who works there. Conduct informational interviews with these people. Bookmark the company website career pages and subscribe to updates, if available. Apply directly to hiring managers instead of through the ATS.

You can even add which technologies you’ve utilized at roles the way LinkedIn is currently trying to add skills. Not all the jobs are technical, like programming or product management, but if you’re in the tech industry, that’s the niche the job board is in. \n\nSomething really nice about Otta is that they include the Glassdoor ratings for companies as well, which is great because sometimes startups, especially the earlier stage or ones with <500 employees, can be a bit dicey around inexperienced management and claiming work/life balance while in reality push the “hustle” mentality. \n\nThey’re great for finding Remote-based work as well, since a lot of startups/fast-paced growing companies don’t care yet about HR laws and regulations across different states, they care about the talent. Once companies get bigger and older, they typically only hire remotely from states where they have established entities because of all the paperwork and the need to stay up-to-date with individual state compliance.\n\n- Edited for clarity around tech industry/companies versus tech positions like programming.\n\n#### Comment ID ivb743n with +2 score by [(that_writer_dream, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/ivb743n/) (in reply to ID ivb0vfu):\nThey actually work with a pretty even amount of start-ups and large companies (Deliveroo, Bumble, Spotify, the Financial Times).

When you find a job posting you like on LinkedIn, go to the actual companies website, go to their “careers” section, find the job, and apply directly there.\n\n### Comment ID ivap0ti with +24 score by [(weightcantwait, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/ivap0ti/) (in reply to ID iva7h7u):\nApplying to LinkedIn Easy Apply can actually be good. It's helped me land several interviews whereas on the company website you can easily get screened out. Apply on BOTH LinkedIn and the company website.\n\nThe benefit of LinkedIn easy apply is that for several companies (not all) let you just send in a resume without any additional info unlike the company site where you have to waste time copying your resume. Also, if you are getting screened out, recruiters can see your resume more easily through LinkedIn especially if you are one of the first applications. You often get notified if your resume gets read or downloaded, which doesn't mean anything, but gives you additional data on what types of roles and companies are interested.\n\nI've landed two solid jobs through LinkedIn easy apply. One called me the same day.\n\n#### Comment ID ivas495 with +7 score by [(Rusty_James, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/ivas495/) (in reply to ID ivap0ti):\nLinkedIn Easy can work, but you’ll often be in a larger applicant pool.

If an offer sounds too good to be true, if the wording feels awkward and overly vague, etc.\n\nMuch of this knowledge just comes from being in an industry for a while and recognizing the normal way roles are talked about. \n\nThat said, here’s the steps I would recommend for everyone:\n\n1. Do enough research into your industry to recognize the standard job title naming conventions and job scope for your level. For example, an entry level marketing role is typically going to be called something like “marketing associate” or “marketing coordinator”, or more specific depending on branch of marketing, so “content marketing associate” etc. For job scope, there will be a few things in your industry that you’ll learn are red flags. For marketing, if they talk about outbound calling, prospecting, sales, etc. then it’s likely a sales role pretending to be a marketing role. If you don’t know what these red flags are in your industry, reach out to a more senior member of this industry through LinkedIn and ask them directly, “what red flags should I watch out for in job postings?”\n\n2. Assuming you find a role that passes the job title and job scope test, start Googling the company. Search for things like “ X company reviews” and “X company scam”. Then visit 1. The companies Glassdoor page 2. The company’s LinkedIn page 3. The company’s website\n\n2a. Does there Glassdoor have multiple positive reviews, salaries listed, etc? (If the company is a small startup, they may have limited info here but still be legit).\n\n2b. Is the company findable on LinkedIn? Do they have many people who say they work there?  Click into these people and make sure they all seem legit. To they have previous experience at different companies? Do they seem to be active profiles?\n\n2c. Finally, visit their website. Does it seem to be a full website? (Not just one or two pages). Does the branding seem trustworthy? Then find the internal job listings page on the website. Is the job listing you saw also listed on their website? If not, there’s a chance that the company is legit, but scammers are pretending to be from the company when they’re not.\n\nIf after all of this, the company still seems legitimate, than apply! When interviewing, make sure you:\n 1. Meet the interviewers face-to-face or on a video chat sometime in the interview process (most start with a phone screen, that’s okay as long as you video chat later). \n2. Only communicate with email addresses that are linked to the company. Example: john@amazon.com. \n3. Don’t give any personal banking or social security # information until contracts have been signed and finalized and you feel 200% sure they are for real.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n### Comment ID ivbjona with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/ivbjona/) (in reply to ID iva7h7u):\nkey word.  \"Depending on industries\".  lol\n\n## Comment ID ivadsk1 with +11 score by [(bryanhernc, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/ivadsk1/) (in reply to ID ynpo8w):\nI’ve had good experiences with indeed and ZipRecruiter.

I wanted to essentially create something that would check my CV, and find the most relevant jobs on the internet to return them back to me in seconds. Better than spending hours on LinkedIn reading irrelevant long job postings (even skimming them was boring)\n\nThe apps i found would use ai to apply to jobs for you and I found some scary reviews. Apparently they just send applications made with AI absolutely everywhere hoping you land one. They are playing a number game basically. \n\nI knew the tool had to be an assistant. not an automation. The only automation id allow would be the one that finds the relevant jobs for me. the cv and cover letter writing can be supported by AI but not fully generated by AI. Something like a draft at most.\n\nAnyways... long story short. I took matter into my own hands and created [wizapply.app](http://wizapply.app) .

When a new role gets approved we immediately post the role to our own website, indeed and LinkedIn.\n\nIf the role is posted for a few weeks and we don't get any suitable candidates, that's when we start looking at internal, we never intend to mislead candidates, and we never post a job if an internal candidate is already suggested.\n\nIn terms of other places to look..

Zip recruiter is nice where employers can “like” your resume or application, rate it, give feedback, and even contact you through it to say “you look qualified for our position.

But I was told about the opening by someone at the company a couple of hours before it was posted and was one of the first applicants, the first interviewee, and the first to go through the hiring process for the position, which gave me a deciding advantage it seems. But the only reason I knew about it was because someone told me about the position opening up and I was able to saw \"I heard about this position from Bob\" on the application and the screening call. Didn't say he referred me and I know he didn't have any internal referral but being able to say he told me about the position at least got me an interview.\n\nAs much as linked in sucks and is full of low quality guru crap, networking in it is the way to go.\n\n## Comment ID hm27esf with +8 score by [(btw_i_use_ubuntu, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm27esf/) (in reply to ID r1ynlc):\nIf you just search up \"[title] jobs [area]\" on Google, it will compile results from a bunch of different job posting sites.\n\n## Comment ID hm2ecfb with +7 score by [(justsomeguycmh, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm2ecfb/) (in reply to ID r1ynlc):\nClearancejobs is great if considering federal contractor positions.\n\n### Comment ID hm2g3as with +6 score by [(Meglamar, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm2g3as/) (in reply to ID hm2ecfb):\nThis.

Full time.  Last year during full on covid.\n\nLinkedIn, Indeed, and a network of recruiters I have come to know from many contracts I have done.  \n\nIndeed was the worst, and normally was just cross posts and never used the Indeed built in system\n\nLinkedIn was actually pretty awesome with the open to work feature and their revamped job searching. \n\nMy recruiter network got me a handful of interviews  and an offer.\n\nLinkedIn recruiter who got in touch with me actually got me the position, so a huge win for LinkedIn. I used the offer I had to knock my pay up even more.  Thanks job I was never going to take!\n\nThese recruiters use tools to search LinkedIn profiles for keywords, so your profile can literally make or break you.  These recruiters don't understand what x buzzword is. They spend seconds on your profile to see if you are a possible match and move on, so your profile should be as complete as possible..  Have some project work to give them an idea of what kind of work you can do.\n\nThe better my profile was, the more I got random recruiters  to contact me, and about better jobs.\n\nThis is the way now.  Learn it and get a better job.\n\n### Comment ID hmuxmau with +1 score by [(nicepersondonthate, Reddit, 2021-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hmuxmau/) (in reply to ID hm2lnfx):\nenjoy being replaced soon, since you used the \"i got another job offer card\", can only use that once then you are on their shit list.

That wasn't the point of the comment, though I guess I could have worded it better.  It was meant to be a quick response for OP's question.\n\nWhat actually happened in my case was that I received an offer for a higher paying job at a larger company.  At the same time I actually really liked the team and hit it off with the CIO at a smaller company, offering less.  I negotiated informing the smaller company that I really wanted the position, but that I had another offer at a higher pay.  The smaller company came back that if we wrapped the deal up immediately they would come up and match.\n\nIt wasn't that they didn't value me, they had a price they offered for the position.  On the contrary...They liked me, I liked them, but I informed them I had a higher offer.  They thought I was worth it and went above their original salary offer.\n\nAlmost two years in, I still love the position, love the team, have a much better work/life balance than had I taken the first offer, and so wouldn't change a thing.\n\nInforming a prospective employer that you have an existing offer, and negotiating to get yourself better pay/benefits/etc. seems is pretty standard.  Was it risky?  Sure, it had elevated risk that the job I really wanted to get would leave the table, but it was something I took a chance on, and it instead validated my belief that they did value me.  Also, I had no duty to the first company, and simply informed them I would be taking another offer.  No bridges burnt, so cards used, no shit list necessary.  It's just business.  \n\nI don't really think \"the proper amount\" exists.  We negotiate with what employers feel we are worth from a multitude of reasons and what that is can be different for the same person at the same positions at various companies.\n\n## Comment ID hm27j7q with +4 score by [(Zengaroni, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm27j7q/) (in reply to ID r1ynlc):\nI have always used LinkedIn.

Check out their websites. Apply to the gigs. Contact their recruiters on linkedin asking about the gig and if they are still hiring (e.g. get noticed.) Sometimes this can help you rise to the top.\n\nUltimately the job posting sites typically have lots of applicants. Often recruiting at places is poor and doesn't list in the right way or doesn't list anywhere but their own website, or they go through 3rd parties which don't tell you who you are working for up front.\n\nYou can get a job from many ways, just trying to offer an alternative method i've seen work. :)\n\n## Comment ID hm3iprg with +2 score by [(Big-Sploosh, Reddit, 2021-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm3iprg/) (in reply to ID r1ynlc):\nSpeaking as someone based in the US:\n\nLinkedIn and just applying directly on the company website.

There is also USAJobs if you are looking into 2210 series jobs for federal agencies, some hiring more frequently than others (Bureau of Land Management, Indian Health Service, EPA, and in the worst case scenario; the Bureau of Prisons...)

I've use multiple websites (e.g. LinkedIn, Indeed, the job websites themselves), networking, cold calling, none seen to work. Even the jobs / people I hear back from or do second round interviews with, seem to be fruitless. So far I've probably applied to 400 + jobs since January, and have only 1 new interview coming up, and worried I might not get the job.\n\nEven though I get compliments on my resume and worth ethic, seems like its never good enough.\n\nIs there something I am missing? I've tried fixing and perfecting my resume, attaching recommendation letters, doing certifications in hopes of boosting my application / status. I'm willing to try anything at this point to make sure I am able to make a living wage.\n\nEdit: location: NYC\n\nMajor: English.\n\nBackground: \n\nI've been a legal assistant, an uncertifed paralegal for a combination of 2 years (and doing side work currently). \n\nWas a administrative (data) analyst doing work for the city for almost 3 years, heavily using numerous program including excel.

Companies like to go through them bc the  the vetting is done.\n\nAlso, reach out to people, but never ask someone directly for a job. Look on linkedin for hiring managers or if you have friends, ask for their hr managers and email them short, direct emails.\n\nAlso, even in good job markets, I sent out hundreds of resumes before I got a job.\n\nI know this sounds silly, but always say that youre doing something, even side-hustles, helping people with anything, even dog walking. Companies always find candidates who are in a doing-mode rather than sitting at home. It makes you sound positive, busy, and desirable. It also makes you sound like you have something going on but looked at their company and saw something more interesting. If you have nothing going on, they know people r just desperate and send resumes everywhere.\n\n#### Comment ID l20kuya with +1 score by [(DatFickShawn, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l20kuya/) (in reply to ID l1vg48s):\nYou can always move\n\n### Comment ID l1vzilm with +34 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1vzilm/) (in reply to ID l1vfsfo):\n[removed]\n\n#### Comment ID l1x2mts with +5 score by [(deviltalk, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1x2mts/) (in reply to ID l1vzilm):\nHave you used that website before?

Even if it’s well below your skill level. Bring integrity to the profession. For example, I worked as a dishwasher and learned how people do not care about thoroughly washing dishes. They were able to improve their process through my suggestions. I saw it as if the employer benefits then we do not get sued which means more money for the employer and sometimes means bonuses for us.\n\n#### Comment ID l20opyf with +3 score by [(No_Window644, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l20opyf/) (in reply to ID l1wjqeh):\nLol yes.

First, it’s so unbelievably easier to get a job when you have a job. But I also got a new job back in October after getting blindsided by layoffs at the company I was at - wasn’t just me but everyone on US payroll. \n\nHere are my suggestions. \n\nUse every platform, regardless. I never expected Indeed to work but that’s where I found the October job. Talk to recruiters even if it’s just to practice talking about yourself and learn about what’s going on out there in the world.\n\nInterviewing is like exercising, it gets easier and you get better at it if you do it all the time. Apply for everything. See it as a game to get interviews, even if you suspect it’s a bad fit. You never know, plus it’s great practice. You get to learn about the industry you’re applying to this way.\n\nRealize that luck plays a huge role. I got my job now because I interviewed for another company, got to a third round, then while having a really nice conversation with the interviewer we both realized I wasn’t what they were looking for. However, the interviewer knew of an opportunity at a related company (same source of startup funds) and said he’d forward my name since he thought I’d make a good colleague despite not being suited skills-wise for the role they were interviewing for. When he said that, I had zero expectations, thought maybe he was just letting me down gently (that definitely happens!). But lo and behold, he was true to his word and fast forward a few weeks and I’m at my new job. \n\nIn the meantime, work on the skills you need for this job. Even if it’s as general as reading books about “getting shit done” or how to communicate professionally. These are things people in the world of work are interested in learning about and make for things to talk about in interviews.\n\nThis job hunt shit is like trying to measure a piece of paper in the dark by throwing tiny stones at it. You need to throw as many stones as quickly as possible to get a sense of where you’re at. \n\nDid I want to give up? Did some people make me feel like an imposter? Was I having to regulate myself in good ways and bad throughout? Yes, yes, yes. \n\nYou got to just keep going while taking care of yourself.\n\n## Comment ID l1w1rzl with +27 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1w1rzl/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nOkay, so there’s 2 things you need to understand. \n\n1. The job market is shit right now. You’re applying at the same time as *thousands? Tens of thousands?* of college students who are fresh out of college and looking for jobs. That will become less saturated soon. \n\n2. You’re likely looking for jobs that have the requirements you want. Be willing to take a job that seems “beneath you”. I applied as a bank teller 9 months ago earning $17.25, 6 months later I was earning $19. That may not seem like a ton, but it is steady income and with having roommates, only working 23 hours a week, I still earn $1600 a month and pay $400 in rent and utilities. You just need to make some adjustments and maybe even make some sacrifices, but also be willing to take a variety of different jobs while you search for something more suited to you.\n\n### Comment ID l1x034y with +13 score by [(polishrocket, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1x034y/) (in reply to ID l1w1rzl):\nThat’s great for your situation but when you got a $2,700 mortgage it’s but tougher to take a lower level job like that\n\n### Comment ID l1xoeki with +8 score by [(mushy_orange, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1xoeki/) (in reply to ID l1w1rzl):\nMost people don’t have access to $400 a month rent (and utilities combined no less lol!)

I work in talent acquisition and I am still hiring applicants myself. I hire in a large tech company and hire passive and applicant type of candidates. \n\nI am not saying this is a ground breaking but when my family and friends ask this is what I say. Pull the description of the job you are applying to and review the qualifications. Then the preferred qualifications. Then seriously take a look at your skills and experiences and consider objectively are they aligned and have you portrayed those skills with the bullet points and data to show the impact? If yes, then it is a resume issue. If not, you need to think about the employers perspective. \n\nI hate to put it simply, but a job is just about ROI for the company. They aren’t just hiring people for fun, they need to invest into you and they expect to get more value back. Show them how you provide value. It could be automating manual work, cost savings, revenue growth, operational efficiency, etc. \n\nThen I would apply to the job, reach out to the job poster / hiring manager, and I would message people doing the role now and see if they are open to chatting for ten minutes about their role and get a feel if you would even like it. If you’re sure you’d love it I would write a proposal / create a project or showcase of your work that is needed for the role and share it with the team or manager. \n\n\nThe market is tough right now, but businesses are growing and hiring.\n\n#### Comment ID l20a21j with +2 score by [(2boysmomOH, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l20a21j/) (in reply to ID l1yu27n):\nThis is exceptional advice. I look at resumes every single day and can’t tell you how often I have asked myself “why in the world is this person applying to this job?”. 3 key things I see all the time. 1) Pay attention to the posting and pull those details out in your resume. 2) Don’t leave an objective on there that says “to gain an entry level position as a llama groomer” if the job you are applying for has nothing to do with llamas 3) Have someone else proofread your resume.

You mentioned analytics but have an English degree, finish up those certifications, get more, and make sure you market yourself accordingly.

I realize this is Reddit not a job application or networking email but I hope you are reviewing your professional communications for spelling, grammar, and syntax before sending.

I was still working at my last job so I was only open to clear steps up in career/pay, otherwise the time it took to get my new job would have been much less. I also had the benefit of recruiters calling me and messaging me on LinkedIn. \n\nI wanted to tell you a few things I noticed in my search that might help you: \n\nMany corporations seemed to be hiring for experienced legal assistants, contract admins, and project managers (that were actually legal assistants with odd titles) when I was looking. \n\nGet creative about searching LinkedIn titles that might apply to your skill set. Message recruiters if you can after you apply online. \n\nSearch “corporate governance” on LinkedIn, it seemed like this legal department across many orgs needed good help when I was looking. \n\nLook into contract admin roles. These jobs would be good for your skill set and usually pay well. \n\nGo to company websites (focusing on the F100 companies first, and then work your way through the F500 list) and manually scroll through their legal/admin/analyst/(insert whatever else your interested in) openings. There might be roles you’re missing on job boards due to weird new titles. \n\nMake sure your resume is tweaked to include as many terms from the job description as possible.\n\n## Comment ID l1ybafv with +3 score by [(yeahyeahyeah_okay, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1ybafv/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nIt took me months to get a call center job.

He has done a couple of interviews and got one job offer with a salary of $1700 a month before taxes. A total smack in the face to his qualifications. We obviously are not that desperate and found it wasn’t even worth the cost in gas to drive into work 5 days a week. We live in Miami too so for an employer to offer that salary here is an absolute joke! The job market right now is so competitive, more people are working than ever before. We need the older generation to retire asap and open up some positions. But with the way Medicare is and the lack of companies that offer pensions, those generations are working longer than previous generations. We feel your pain, friend.

The job market has turned into a platform akin to Tinder, except the employer is the drop dead gorgeous blonde that gets 100+ messages an hour, and we are all the neckbeard \"nice guys\" lamenting how no one recognizes them and they deserve a date.\n\n  \nWhile I don't mean that we are all whiny, self-entitled, adult-children it is true that employers are seeing an increase in interest because we have made jobs excessively more accessible.  The traditional 40 hour work week is antiquated, we value showing up more than production in the workplace.  Why is this a problem?  With WFH becoming an increasingly viable option, people are able to take on 2, 3, and sometimes 4 jobs while still maintaining a high level of production while appearing to be \"at work\" 40 hours at all those jobs.\n\n  \nWith your current situation, WFH might not be the culprit but rather talent pool available in the area.  In a city as large as NYC, there is likely several hundred applicants to every job.  While you might think this puts you in a poor position, the truth is you will eventually find the right fit for you.  Consider this difficulty as a screening process on both ends.  It took me several hundred applications, multiple final interviews where I was ghosted, being told I was over and under qualified at the same time... but eventually I found the right fit for myself, my family, and my career.  Looking back, I was excited about a change not the company I was applying to.\n\n  \nThe hack is simple, keep applying and change your mindset from these being interviews to them being dates.  It is two sided, you need to like them as much as they like you.  Rejection is just one side or both realizing it isn't the best fit.  Don't take it personally, the same as having a date or two and realizing you don't find the person physically attractive or emotionally/intellectually stimulating enough to make them your long term relationship.\n\n## Comment ID l1xhbie with +2 score by [(gilgobeachslayer, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1xhbie/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nNetworking\n\n## Comment ID l1xinbu with +2 score by [(3Maltese, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1xinbu/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nHave Reddit take a look at your resume [https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/)\n\n## Comment ID l1xk8nd with +2 score by [(KriWee, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1xk8nd/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nI used to get people begging me for interviews on LinkedIn (I’ve gotten laid off a lot…) now it’s radio silence, even with a recruiter who my boss connected me with and sang my praises to personally.

The best way to do that is let them know it's there. Submit the application, then send a message on LinkedIn, \"Hey, I wanted to let you know that I have submitted an application for 'XXX' It sounds like a great opportunity, let me know if we can connect for a chat'\n\n  \nSecond - stand out in the interview - small talk, make a joke, a unique perspective on something, connect with the recruiter\n\nThird - Follow up, 24-48 hours after the interview send an email, 'thanks for taking the time to chat with me, I really loved learning about x, y and z, I am even more excited about this opportunity now! I hope to hear back from you soon regarding next steps, have a great day!'\n\n  \nYou need to realise it's a numbers game, a recruiter will look at probably 1000 resumes per week, they will screen or interview 40-50+ people per week for a dozen different roles, these steps make sure the recruiter doesn't forget who you are.\n\n## Comment ID l1y84ev with +2 score by [(Truncated_Rhythm, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1y84ev/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nNetwork.

I believe the idea is that the process is so much more automated now and tracks down candidates by keywords, but there is a complete human element missing. I've hired tons of people in the past and a fair amount of them I would not have had I only gone by their resume with no interaction. I understand that companies are short-staffed these days but I do believe these same companies are missing out on true talent by relying on the automation to identify their candidates. Having been on the hiring side of things, I have found that there are some pretty underwhelming recruiters out there.

All of my positions since my first entry-level, cattle-call job were placed with a recruiter. I had two similar experiences over the last two years working for smaller tech companies that had financing failures leading to large layoffs, and both times I took months trying and failing to find myself a new role, only to connect with a recruiter and end up with two offers within a few weeks. I know this is not going to be a possibility for every type of job, but searching and applying independently felt like shouting into a void and kept me ignored.\n\n## Comment ID l1yw4xx with +2 score by [(jmcreynolds2001, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1yw4xx/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nI apologize ahead of time for this.

I have found it can help to 1) focus on applying to small local businesses that are imho less likely to post fake openings and 2) work with a recruiter. My current and previous job are both jobs with local businesses, and the previous one was found through a recruiter. I applied to a LOT of jobs before getting each of those. \n\nIf times are tight and you just need a little bit of money to tide you over, jobs in the restaurant industry and retail are in my experience way less likely to be fake than corporate jobs.

Don’t say “I was assisting my boss with correspondence,” it’s “Facilitated management of 387 client.”\n\n## Comment ID l20q5g2 with +1 score by [(rightyrip, Reddit, 2024-05-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l20q5g2/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nReferral honestly\n\n## Comment ID l20qxlt with +1 score by [(armymdic00, Reddit, 2024-05-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l20qxlt/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nHonestly you’re competing against grads with relevant majors for their field.

I spent a week trying to decide if I wanted to continue my career or just phone it in at Home Depot. Tuned up my resume, reset my website, and started the hunt. Applied to 130 or so targeted positions between Indeed, LinkedIn, and Glassdoor. Interviewed with three places over about five weeks, got offers at two, accepted one. \n\nStarted in February. Here we are, nearly May, and I’m still getting callbacks from places I applied to in November. \n\nThe job market sucks bad. I’m lucky enough to have a weird skill set and a literal stack of degrees, but my former employer still thought I was easily replaced. They are still struggling to replace me- I took my institutional knowledge with me and I had been doing nearly pure process improvement and change management. \n\nI quadrupled their business and made it easier for them to handle the growth- one of the owners thought I made it easy enough to manage that they could take over and keep my salary. They choked on the growth and have burned through two hires since I left. \n\nI’m not a manager anymore, and I’ve only done two process improvement projects at the new gig, but it’s low key, I do far less work, it’s 100% remote, and the pay is literally identical. \n\nIf you’re good at what you do and you’re likable, then you’ll be fine.

It's unfortunately, not just you. It's the market. I also think that the types of jobs that you are applying for and the industries may be in a bit a lull at the moment. \n\nA few comments on what you've mentioned below:\n\n*\"Is there something I am missing? I've tried fixing and perfecting my resume, attaching recommendation letters, doing certifications in hopes of boosting my application / status. I'm willing to try anything at this point to make sure I am able to make a living wage.\"*\n\n1. I recommend continuously updating your resume and trying and target it as closely as you can to the jobs you are applying for. If you've applied for over 400 jobs and you're not getting many interviews you may be missing some keywords in your resume that are not resonating with AI or ATS.\n\n2. Attaching recommendation letters at this point wont really help you if your resume isn't able to first make it past recruiters and hiring managers. Recruiters take about 6 seconds to review a resume and if they don't like what they see, they won't read anything else (cover letters, recommendation letters etc.).\n\n3. Certifications - same thought as above. A few questions here: Would it help to get a certification as a paralegal? Are the positions that you are applying for asking for specific certifications? Are you attaching the certifications that are relevant to the specific role you are applying for or attaching everything that you have to all of the postings?\n\n4. \"Willing to try everything\" - you have the non-profit experience. Have you considered volunteering at an organization to gain some experience and keep your resume fresh? I can appreciate that this isn't paid work, and of course isn't ideal or the end goal here. However, this may be an opportunity for you may be able to gain some connections and this could possibly open to the door to some opportunities for you. I think at this stage, building relationships even if there is no job in sight right away, can be a ++ in your situation. \n\nFinally, a suggestion: I think you may have to create two types of resumes: one for the legal/admin field and the other for data analytics. At first glance reading what you wrote, as a recruiter I would have some questions about the type of positions you'd be a fit for. However, I am not sure if this the case as I've not seen your resume. Gut feeling though is telling me that your resume may need a bit more focus.\n\nQuestion for you and maybe something to think about :): Do you want to go into the legal field or data? Keep us posted on how you do please and good luck.\n\n## Comment ID l215uwc with +1 score by [(Smashingly_Awesome, Reddit, 2024-05-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l215uwc/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nI think Ai can do all the paralegal work now.

Here’s all of my advice I have that exists: \n\n1. Sell or sublet your home, stay with family or friends in a cheaper neighborhood. You’re in an extremely expensive market. Subletting, even on Airbnb, can turn your liability into an income source, especially if you can manage to live for free while doing so. \n\n2. Use your City Privilege. Because you have existed in a notoriously tough job market, it will be relatively easy for you to find work, as long as you go literally anywhere else. \n\n3. Look for people who look like you. Employers these days are relatively narcissistic. Look at group photos of staff, or industry convention photos. Find the companies where people look like you, physically or otherwise. \n\n4. Consider your brand strategy. These days we aren’t people. We’re a brand. Ensure you use consistent color schemes, messaging, and promotional content across platforms. Fill in the blank in one of these sentences: “I am the [blank] person”. “I am the person who [blank]” I am the go-to guy for [blank]”. \n\nI am a lawyer (meh)\nI am a criminal lawyer (who isn’t) \n\nI am the go-to criminal lawyer in New York City because of my honesty, integrity, and my 80% non-conviction rate. (Someone like this will tailor their other posts to talk about house arrest, lighter sentences, the importance of admitting guilt, as opposed to the next person:) \n\nI was the go-to criminal lawyer in New York City until I realized that some people think they’re above the law: that’s when I became a torts lawyer! (This person will post/talk about recidivism rates, punishment rates for white collar crime, the importance of advocacy, and class action suits). \n\nAnother example: Julia completed medical school but she wasn’t able to pass the exam or land an internship. She’s looking for work that uses the skills she has, but doesnt want to talk about the licensing issue. \n\nHer brand would be “I am a biology person who has studied health, wellness, and anatomy. I understand the human body very well, and I want to help others to understand theirs.” \n\n5. Create more than one resume, one per hat you wear, that emphasizes those skills. Julia might have one resume for consulting, another one for medical careers in the periphery, like lab technician, and another for retail jobs if that’s what ends up paying the rent. \n\n6. Make your resume look more professional by giving your title a spit shine. Use full sentences and not point form. Use direct measurables. Wow them, but be honest. Focus on skills that will matter to the new employer. \n\nEg \n\nParalegal at Wocket, Pocket, and Sprocket \n•Pushed papers\n•Researched Cases\n•Everyone’s scapegoat \n\nbecomes \n\nAt WSC I had the opportunity to broaden my understanding of legal terminology, syntax and database systems as utililized in the (type of law) field. As a legal professional with (years of experience, specialized training, great hair, etc) I will be an asset to the (company name) because (thing you do that directly aligns with the employment ad). \n\n7. Hack the AI. Copypaste the employment ad itself into an AI. Copypaste your resume into the same AI. Ask the AI to align your resume with the employment ad. Use that as an outline for your cover letter. Basically, use a translator. You can’t talk to computers as well as they can. \n\n8. Hack the human. To build interview skills, I suggest volunteering. Not in your industry. At a hospital. Or a soup kitchen. Or a daycare. Because once you can convince a 4 year old or crackhead that underpants are not hats, convincing a law firm that you are the best paralegal ever to float on a cloud directly to the 44th floor wearing a halo of statutes and regulations will be the easiest thing you have ever done. \n\nGood luck, and Godspeed!\n\n## Comment ID mhhfi8y with +1 score by [(QueenTiti_Mua, Reddit, 2025-03-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/mhhfi8y/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nI haven’t been able to get a job or find clients as a make up artist and I got a coffee bus that I’m unable to run bc I ran out of money.

Was about to get a 5th but called them to let them know I accepted another before they got a chance to send it.\n\nHere’s what helped me:\n* Tailoring resume to each skill set I have and having combo resumes if the job I’m applying to requires multiple disciplines. Ex: One PR resume, one social media resume, one PR and social media resume, so on and so forth.\n* Making sure most bullets on my resume are quantifying my work. You won’t look as legit without numbers.\n* Having down pact my elevator pitch for the famous “tell me about yourself” question.\n* Applying to mostly jobs in my area. I found out of state roles came with more rejections. No one wants to cover relocation expenses anymore and don’t want to hear that you will pay for them yourself.\n* This is optional but I kept a spreadsheet of every single interview I did with the job title, salary, location, etc., to see where I stand and what jobs I am getting the most traction with. This informed what roles I applied to the most. It showed a nice pattern.\n* For interviews, I had my big accomplishments ready. These were things not on my resume as they are more specific. These accomplishments are big project that I created from scratch or any big deal campaign I had a large role in. Whatever questions they asked, I was able to show I have done that before by leaning on the actions that led to those accomplishments.\n\nGood luck!\n\n## Comment ID l1wygtp with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1cgfl6h/how_are_people_getting_jobs_nowadays/l1wygtp/) (in reply to ID 1cgfl6h):\nTrades.

Toxic culture lead by toxic higher ups. 4 layoffs (maybe 5 now with a new one January 2024 that I saw...) and each time there was zero sympathy or explanation. Instead, each layoff added pressure to current employees who then had to triple their work load for no additional pay. One time I heard the CEO tell people in the office that they should get back to work, when they were talking about an INTERNAL committee they were on and tasked with. The office is a graveyard with a requirement to come in even though 90% of the desks are empty and one half of the office doesn't even have the lights on anymore. I hate office days because it is eerily quiet and the days are depressing. CEO and VPs are the definition of toxic. They are always on expensive vacations abroad while everyone else is worked to the bone, and the \"unlimited PTO/ half day Fridays\" are a joke. I never get to take a half day on a Friday because of the added work load, and hands get slapped if you take a day off even if it is for mental health. \n\nDEI is nonexistent.\n\nI do not see the culture or anything about the company improving because the same VPs and higher ups are always safe, who are truly causing the issues. They should be embarrassed but their egos are too big to ever feel that way. \n\nAlso base pay is a joke compared to any other company.",

We are glad to hear that during your time at Built In you experienced the passion and drive of the leadership team, while also having fun! \r\n\r\nAlmost all companies, including Built In, have been impacted by the unpredictable market dynamics. This has caused us to take a close look at our own organization.  It is our responsibility to ensure that our company continues to stay strong. Like most companies, we re-forecasted and our Sales reps have a clear path to attainment. \r\n \r\nWith that goal in mind, we were faced with challenging decisions. In October, we made the difficult decision to implement a workforce reduction that impacted 23% of our employees. \r\n \r\nThis was an incredibly hard decision and one that we hoped we would never need to make.  When looking at the impact on the business as a result of this economic downturn, we needed to evaluate current staffing levels and bring them into alignment with the reality of our business needs. Our goal is to make the transition for affected employees as smooth as possible. To do that, every affected employee was offered severance pay, continuation coverage under our health insurance and Modern Health benefits through the end of November, and the ability to keep their company-issued laptop for their job search.",

We’ve responded by making it easier than ever for our users to find companies they love, and our clients to hire talent directly from Built In. We understand the importance of providing a strong work life balance for our employees and have taken many steps to make sure we strike the right balance, including the following: 1) Quarterly Wellness Days; 2) Introduced a recommended minimum of 15 PTO days per year; 3) A company-wide week off for employees to recharge and disconnect in addition to normal PTO. We’ve seen great results from these initiatives and during our Annual Engagement Survey this summer, 94% of employees reported that they are able to arrange time out from work when needed.",

We also provide a forum for employees to submit questions that get answered during each of those meetings. In our latest Engagement Survey, 80% of employees reported that the leaders at Built In keep people informed about what is happening. \n\nAs for pay transparency, the People Team has committed to it as a strategic roadmap item and we are in progress and on track for our pay transparency project. This is a major project that requires a lot of data analysis, auditing, process building and stakeholder participation on the backend. We want to make sure that we are building a scalable program that clearly defines our compensation philosophy and provides employees and candidates with the insight they need for their roles. The beginning of the salary band rollout will take place at the end of Q4 and likely be finalized early in Q1.",

Like most tech companies, we were impacted by the most recent market downturn and experienced the need to downsize some of our sales team members. We are in an economic climate that demands constant change of organizations, and our leadership team is dedicated to the success of our people as we emerge stronger than ever before. We continue to invest in developing as people-leaders, as the success of any organization is deeply rooted in the satisfaction and well-being of its employees. \n\nWe take pride in our offerings, and we are disappointed to hear that you found them subpar. We are constantly working to enhance our products and services, and have invested heavily in these by bringing in a Chief Technology Officer and doubling down on R&amp;D to get us to a spot to go international in the near future. We are pleased to say that our products will continue to be enhanced in our pursuit of delivering top results to our tech visitors and customers. \n\nIf you are open to it, we would appreciate the opportunity to discuss your concerns in more detail and gather additional insights that can help us address specific issues. You can reach out directly to our CEO or to our Head of People at any time.  We take all feedback seriously, and your insights are invaluable as we continuously strive to improve our organization.",

Last year we introduced an annual Inclusion Survey, dedicated to gathering employee feedback that would shape our annual DEI roadmap. We had over 60% of our employees participate in the survey, and we presented the results during a company-wide meeting including highlighting both our areas of strengths and areas of opportunity. While we are proud of our gender diversity (&gt;50% of our employees identify as women), we recognize we still have work to do to increase our intersectional representation across the business and have initiatives in place within our roadmap to accomplish this goal. \r\n\r\nRegarding our Leadership team, we care deeply about career development at Built In and are grateful that 3 of our 12 (25%) leaders have begun their careers with us as individual contributors and over their tenure have grown into VPs. That said, 75% of our leadership team have 10-15+ years of external experience across Growth, Enterprise, and Fortune 500 companies. \r\n\r\nCommitment to transparent communications is one of the top priorities of our leadership team, which is why we conduct a monthly company-wide meeting to ensure our employees are looped in to our top strategic initiatives and happenings across the business. We encourage employees to submit questions for our Q&amp;A portion of that meeting to ensure they have answers to any outstanding questions and are informed on the topics that are important to them. In addition, we have invested in training for all managers focused on feedback and coaching - it is our expectation that feedback is continuous and based on observable behaviors. We’ll continue to work on driving transparency across all levels of the business and appreciate you taking the time to flag this opportunity for improvement to us.",

We’re so glad that you felt connected to your teammates and the people around you. \r\n\r\nAs a recruitment marketing platform, our customers often reside in HR &amp; Talent positions. We have seen great success in hiring folks from the staffing world as they deeply understand our buyer persona and our industry as a whole! That said, Built In has always been committed to hiring top talent, and prioritizes both diversity of thought and experience - especially for roles that manage people.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to build long lasting teams with inspired leaders, and we are proud to share that our employees have an overall average tenure of 3.1 years, with Management at an average tenure of 4.4 Years. Specifically on our Account Management team the average employee tenure is 3.4 years, with a management tenure of 4.9 years. This is well above the industry average, which is something we are incredibly proud of.\r\n\r\nRegarding our Revenue infrastructure, we endeavor to set our teams up for optimal success, and recognize there are always areas for improvement. While we absolutely make mistakes, we make what we believe to be the best decisions based on the information we had at that time. Most importantly, those decisions and changes are always well-intentioned with the Account Manager and customer as the priority. However, what worked years ago, does not always continue to be the best approach. The past 12 months forced us to move swiftly related to territories/books, commission structure and we’re proud of the changes we’ve made in the positive direction the past 6 months to allow for a more equitable and predictable environment.\r\n\r\nThanks again for sharing your thoughts.

          "cons": "I witnessed deceptive and unprincipled practices by upper management and HR on numerous occasions. In particular, Built In's regular practice of bribing people who are leaving to sign a non-disparagement agreement in order to get severance pay should stop you—a person reading Glassdoor reviews—in your tracks. I refused to sign, even though they offered me a month's salary to do so, which is why I am legally able to leave this review. Think about all the people who got laid off (1/4 of their workforce in fall 2022 alone) who needed that money and decided to sign. You're not hearing from them here, which radically juices the company's ratings as an employer. Core values are not taken seriously by leadership. I regularly tried to lead with solutions by \"poking holes and offering ideas to patch them up,\" as they like to say, and was told to put my head down and keep these thoughts to myself. Even easy-to-implement fixes that everyone could agree on were regularly sidelined due politics or personalities. People who don't take the hint here are asked to resign or laid off at the first opportunity. Content leaders don't believe in the expertise of content creators and do not want them to \"do more.\" Despite being told when I was hired that they were looking for someone who would bring new ideas, strategies and processes to the team, they really wanted a cog in a machine who would shovel content through the mill, not someone interested in raising—or even maintaining—quality or standards. DEI at Built In is all talk and no action. As a hiring manager, I struggled to diversify our very homogeneous team, but the candidate pool was very white and male in every one of the 9 or so hires I was directly involved in. I asked HR for help in expanding this pool and they refused, telling me I needed to come up with my own strategies to expand the applicant pool because they were too busy to offer support. Several candidates of color made it to the final round, only to be denied by leaders or HR for not passing the personality test they make candidates take or not having the right disposition, look or \"culture fit.\" In fact, it was an open secret (on my team, at least) that HR is pretty much useless after you're onboarded. Every time I reached out with a \"people team\" issue, HR would take days or weeks to even respond. I repeatedly had to follow up on my own emails just to get a response! The eventual reply was usually to cut and paste sections of the handbook (that I'd obviously already read) or send URLs to outside advice articles (that they'd already asked managers to read). Then they would schedule follow-up meetings with me to see what I had done to fix the issue on my own, filling up my already stuffed calendar with garbage check-ins to clear themselves of accountability. I've literally never had to deal with a less valuable HR group in my nearly two decades in the professional workforce. I witnessed first-hand multiple occasions of the content studio team being undermined or stabbed in the back by petty managers and leaders on the news team and thrown under the bus by a leaderless sales team. I personally tried to create bonds between these teams to create some empathy between them, but eventually gave up in disgust.",

While we can’t address each of your comments effectively in this forum, we do want to touch on a few of them. \r\n \r\nFirst, we echo your kudos for our writers – we agree wholeheartedly that they are talented, passionate, and hardworking!  We are also pleased to hear that you feel you were able to achieve a healthy work-life balance during your time with us.  This is critically important to the leaders of our organization at every level. We were also glad to hear that you found value in the manager training options provided by the People Team, ranging from our Manager CORE training from LifeLabs to our introduction of Paradigm Reach, an on-demand DEI learning tool. \r\n \r\nWe do take exception to your comment that requesting a non-disparagement covenant as a condition of receiving severance pay is somehow inappropriate. Please know that it’s standard practice to include a severance pay offer in a standard separation agreement containing customary terms and conditions, including a non-disparagement covenant.  \r\nWe acknowledge your concern regarding our lack of diversity.  We recognize that we still have work to do and we are working on strategies to diversify the applicant pool so that we can continue our initiative to improve DEI at Built In.\r\n \r\nFinally, we are proud of our managers (especially the individual who managed you during your employment with us), who encourage a variety of opinions and discourse, as well as our HR team for being responsive to the questions and viewpoints of our team. We are disappointed to learn that you feel your ideas were not given appropriate attention. It’s important to us that everyone feels valued for the contributions they bring to work every day!\r\n \r\nWe would like the opportunity to further explore your concerns now that we are aware of them, and we encourage you to reach out any time to our People Team.

          "cons": "While working here as a senior team member, I discovered I was paid less than new hires in junior roles, despite consistently being recognized as a top performer. I was also “quiet hired” to take on additional responsibilities without a raise or promotion. It was very discouraging to discover that Built In is engaged in the very practices it publicly preaches against. \n\nThe work-life balance was terrible. I worked until 10 or 11 most nights and most weekends, too. This was common on my team. We had to keep up with unreasonable KPIs while leaders resisted our attempts to improve processes. \n\nMany of the perks are mostly performative. If you want to use a wellness day to recover from burnout, you have to scramble twice as hard to get set up for your absence. Half-day Fridays are cool in theory, except the majority of my team worked Friday afternoons anyway to keep up with unreasonable workloads. Unlimited PTO apparently does have limits, a colleague was once told that they shouldn’t take more than ~13 days, and it is possible to get written up for “excessive PTO.” \n\nSo the company loves to dangle these perks as differentiators when they lack meaning in practice.\n\nThere have been four layoffs since October 2022. Two public RIFs, a quiet restructuring, and a more recent silent layoff where remaining employees only found out through LinkedIn posts from their impacted colleagues. Despite the writing on the wall, the leadership remains toxically positive, bordering on delusion. At all-hands meetings, the CEO espouses a hustle mentality, insinuating that the grind and a positive attitude will pay off for everyone (except those who were laid off, obviously) and that the company is winning. I’ll never forget when – a few days after the second RIF – the company kicked off the next all-hands with upbeat pop music and the CEO telling the remaining staff to stay off LinkedIn because it was too depressing.\n\nI’m sure there will be a careful response to this review, as there is on all of the others. So I'll proactively say, in regards to pay transparency that would have addressed my pay disparity, the company said \"they were working on it\" for 2 years and eventually rolled out a disappointing, opaque process. And ultimately, they can’t say anything to change my experience – but I’m one of the few who got off easy. Many others are afraid to post their honest accounts of working at Built In out of concern for the NDA signed in exchange for severance during the many layoffs. \n\nMy advice to jobseekers considering a job here? Do NOT buy into the gospel or sacrifice yourself. Negotiate the heck out of your job offer and always remember: you are disposable.",

Employee success, culture, wellness, and actual happiness are at the forefront of how Built In treats their employees regardless of the market. I can honestly say I ENJOY working each day, and so do those around me. Keeping a good attitude and drive during a rough market is hard to do and not for everyone, but I am surrounded by people who genuinely care which is so cool.

The CEO is convinced that the product is an enterprise offering, but it cannot support large companies. There is also a push to move internationally before the product provides value in US markets.\r\n\r\nExperienced leaders turn over quickly and then they are blamed for the failings of the company. It's a burnout factory where the CEO can't stand it if someone else's ideas are successful. Once you challenge, you are pushed out.\r\n\r\nThe senior sales team is comprised of some of inexperienced sales people who are friends with leadership. \r\n\r\nThe product is old technology and poorly integrated across sites. There is enough technical debt to cripple the platform, but it is never addressed because they are always pursuing shiny objects with no proof that there is market need for the solution.\r\n\r\nPoor planning, lack of strategy and, copycat mentality have resulted in four layoffs over the past 2 years. Even when they promise that it will be the last.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of talk about the company being people first and valuing diversity. It's lip service.\r\n\r\nIf you want to just show up and agree with the leadership, you'll do fine. If you want to get anything done or make an impact, look elsewhere.",

Since 2019 there have been at least, count ‘em, 5+ exec (VP and above, including C level ) positions that have left within ~1 year of their start date. Not even counting the numerous 'Director' level positions that have come and gone. Look into median (instead of average) tenure of leadership positions. -Siloed functions. Teams don't work together within their functions, nor do they collaborate across functions. What is product working on? No idea because a product roadmap is not communicated broadly. -Culture. Toxic, plain and simple. Watch out for the most tenured employees, especially in sales and up to the founder and cofounder. Either get in line or prepare to be ostracized. Leading with solutions is a value, but only if it jives with the CEO's agenda. Otherwise, speaking up will mark you for a PIP or for layoffs. -Career progression. Ask HR, there has been a plan for career laddering the last 3 years with no implementation. DE&amp;I is a facade and the team should spend more time focusing on improving culture, community, and investigating employee concerns rather than vanity metrics or responding to these reviews.",

Please know that we do read these, share with leadership, and work collaboratively to make appropriate improvements based on these insights.\r\n\r\nBuilt In has always operated with a people-first mindset, and we agree that there are great, hard working, caring employees who make Built In what it is.\r\n\r\nLike many others, Built In has been impacted by today’s market and the macro economics surrounding the industry. To those employees who were impacted by layoffs, we offered competitive packages, provided resume and interviewing coaching, and offered personal introductions to companies who are hiring. \r\n\r\nWe are doing our best to navigate this new normal and make decisions in the best interest of our people as well as the business.For example, we encourage all of our leaders to manage their teams independently, while cohesively operating under unified values and business practices. What works for one team may not work for another. Which is why we’ve introduced a Flex Work Policy for all of our employees. We offer both Flex Mode and Remote Mode, where you may have the opportunity to work remotely based on your role and function - or enjoy the perks of being in the office on a hybrid schedule. Some departments may choose to designate additional in-office days, but our philosophy is to encourage flexibility to support personal work styles while balancing business needs.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to our leadership, we are proud to have a leadership team with an average tenure of 7.75 years. When you have a group of individuals who work together for that long, it’s natural that friendships form and we’re proud of the deep trust this team has in each other. It allows us to move fast, be innovative, and have deep alignment with our strategic initiatives. The leaders who we’ve brought on board over the last 1-2 years came in for growth and those leaders are not always the type of leaders who can operate in market downturns.  We’re proud of the leaders we have in place and their commitment to supporting and empowering our people is unwavering. \r\n\r\nIf you have additional questions or other concerns you’d like us to address - please feel free to get in touch directly!",

Expect to be on 8-10 hours of meetings per week just doing “ice breakers” and being forced to share personal information with your work colleagues. And if you happen to want to go off camera, or ask for any form of work/life balance?

ZERO people of color in any department I came in contact with, yet preaching about diversity) is the worst I’ve ever experienced.",

Individuals who identify as women account for 58% of our employee population, 55% of all managers and 53% of our leadership team. \r\n\r\nWe conducted our first annual anonymous DEI survey in Q4 of 2021 and across the board, women rated our company more favorably than their peers. For example, participants who identified as women gave the following ratings:\r\n- 96% favorability for “I feel respected at Built In,” \r\n- 91% favorability for “I feel like I belong at Built In,”\r\n- 87% favorability for “At Built In there is open and honest two-way communication” \r\n- 81% favorable for “I can voice a contrary opinion without fear of negative consequences” \r\nWe’re disappointed that you don’t feel you had a similar experience while you were employed with us.\r\n\r\nWe take the safety and wellbeing of our employees very seriously. We conduct annual harassment prevention training for all employees and recently invested in a platform that is trauma-informed, trigger free, and provides the most marginalized individuals with additional resources. \r\n\r\nWe have a longstanding written anti-harassment policy that provides multiple reporting avenues.  Again, we wish you had utilized our policy and brought your concerns to our attention during your employment with us, as we would have followed our outlined protocol by asking you to provide the facts underlying your concerns and promptly investigating those concerns. \r\n\r\nWe would like the opportunity to investigate your concerns now that you have made us aware of them, so we encourage you to reach out directly to any member of our People Team so that we can obtain the additional information we need in order to do so.  Thank you again.\r\n\r\nWe’re surprised to hear your comment about a lack of diversity.

In particular, Built In's regular practice of bribing people who are leaving to sign a non-disparagement agreement in order to get severance pay should stop you—a person reading Glassdoor reviews—in your tracks. I refused to sign, even though they offered me a month's salary to do so, which is why I am legally able to leave this review. Think about all the people who got laid off (1/4 of their workforce in fall 2022 alone) who needed that money and decided to sign. You're not hearing from them here, which radically juices the company's ratings as an employer. Core values are not taken seriously by leadership. I regularly tried to lead with solutions by \"poking holes and offering ideas to patch them up,\" as they like to say, and was told to put my head down and keep these thoughts to myself. Even easy-to-implement fixes that everyone could agree on were regularly sidelined due politics or personalities. People who don't take the hint here are asked to resign or laid off at the first opportunity. Content leaders don't believe in the expertise of content creators and do not want them to \"do more.\" Despite being told when I was hired that they were looking for someone who would bring new ideas, strategies and processes to the team, they really wanted a cog in a machine who would shovel content through the mill, not someone interested in raising—or even maintaining—quality or standards. DEI at Built In is all talk and no action. As a hiring manager, I struggled to diversify our very homogeneous team, but the candidate pool was very white and male in every one of the 9 or so hires I was directly involved in. I asked HR for help in expanding this pool and they refused, telling me I needed to come up with my own strategies to expand the applicant pool because they were too busy to offer support. Several candidates of color made it to the final round, only to be denied by leaders or HR for not passing the personality test they make candidates take or not having the right disposition, look or \"culture fit.\" In fact, it was an open secret (on my team, at least) that HR is pretty much useless after you're onboarded. Every time I reached out with a \"people team\" issue, HR would take days or weeks to even respond. I repeatedly had to follow up on my own emails just to get a response! The eventual reply was usually to cut and paste sections of the handbook (that I'd obviously already read) or send URLs to outside advice articles (that they'd already asked managers to read). Then they would schedule follow-up meetings with me to see what I had done to fix the issue on my own, filling up my already stuffed calendar with garbage check-ins to clear themselves of accountability. I've literally never had to deal with a less valuable HR group in my nearly two decades in the professional workforce. I witnessed first-hand multiple occasions of the content studio team being undermined or stabbed in the back by petty managers and leaders on the news team and thrown under the bus by a leaderless sales team. I personally tried to create bonds between these teams to create some empathy between them, but eventually gave up in disgust.",

Not even counting the numerous 'Director' level positions that have come and gone. Look into median (instead of average) tenure of leadership positions. -Siloed functions. Teams don't work together within their functions, nor do they collaborate across functions. What is product working on? No idea because a product roadmap is not communicated broadly. -Culture. Toxic, plain and simple. Watch out for the most tenured employees, especially in sales and up to the founder and cofounder. Either get in line or prepare to be ostracized. Leading with solutions is a value, but only if it jives with the CEO's agenda. Otherwise, speaking up will mark you for a PIP or for layoffs. -Career progression. Ask HR, there has been a plan for career laddering the last 3 years with no implementation. DE&amp;I is a facade and the team should spend more time focusing on improving culture, community, and investigating employee concerns rather than vanity metrics or responding to these reviews.",

I was also “quiet hired” to take on additional responsibilities without a raise or promotion. It was very discouraging to discover that Built In is engaged in the very practices it publicly preaches against. \n\nThe work-life balance was terrible. I worked until 10 or 11 most nights and most weekends, too. This was common on my team. We had to keep up with unreasonable KPIs while leaders resisted our attempts to improve processes. \n\nMany of the perks are mostly performative. If you want to use a wellness day to recover from burnout, you have to scramble twice as hard to get set up for your absence. Half-day Fridays are cool in theory, except the majority of my team worked Friday afternoons anyway to keep up with unreasonable workloads. Unlimited PTO apparently does have limits, a colleague was once told that they shouldn’t take more than ~13 days, and it is possible to get written up for “excessive PTO.” \n\nSo the company loves to dangle these perks as differentiators when they lack meaning in practice.\n\nThere have been four layoffs since October 2022. Two public RIFs, a quiet restructuring, and a more recent silent layoff where remaining employees only found out through LinkedIn posts from their impacted colleagues. Despite the writing on the wall, the leadership remains toxically positive, bordering on delusion. At all-hands meetings, the CEO espouses a hustle mentality, insinuating that the grind and a positive attitude will pay off for everyone (except those who were laid off, obviously) and that the company is winning. I’ll never forget when – a few days after the second RIF – the company kicked off the next all-hands with upbeat pop music and the CEO telling the remaining staff to stay off LinkedIn because it was too depressing.\n\nI’m sure there will be a careful response to this review, as there is on all of the others. So I'll proactively say, in regards to pay transparency that would have addressed my pay disparity, the company said \"they were working on it\" for 2 years and eventually rolled out a disappointing, opaque process. And ultimately, they can’t say anything to change my experience – but I’m one of the few who got off easy. Many others are afraid to post their honest accounts of working at Built In out of concern for the NDA signed in exchange for severance during the many layoffs. \n\nMy advice to jobseekers considering a job here?

Instead, each layoff added pressure to current employees who then had to triple their work load for no additional pay. One time I heard the CEO tell people in the office that they should get back to work, when they were talking about an INTERNAL committee they were on and tasked with. The office is a graveyard with a requirement to come in even though 90% of the desks are empty and one half of the office doesn't even have the lights on anymore. I hate office days because it is eerily quiet and the days are depressing. CEO and VPs are the definition of toxic. They are always on expensive vacations abroad while everyone else is worked to the bone, and the \"unlimited PTO/ half day Fridays\" are a joke. I never get to take a half day on a Friday because of the added work load, and hands get slapped if you take a day off even if it is for mental health. \n\nDEI is nonexistent.\n\nI do not see the culture or anything about the company improving because the same VPs and higher ups are always safe, who are truly causing the issues.

      "# [14 Dangers of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by Mike Thomas on 2023-02-08](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/risks-of-artificial-intelligence)\nAs AI grows more sophisticated and widespread, the voices warning against the potential dangers of artificial intelligence grow louder.\n\n“These things could get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over, and we need to worry now about how we prevent that happening,” said Geoffrey Hinton, known as the “Godfather of AI” for his foundational work on machine learning and neural network algorithms. In 2023, Hinton left his position at Google so that he could “talk about the dangers of AI,” noting a part of him even regrets his life’s work.\n\nThe renowned computer scientist isn’t alone in his concerns.\n\nTesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, along with over 1,000 other tech leaders, urged in a 2023 open letter to put a pause on large AI experiments, citing that the technology can “pose profound risks to society and humanity.”\n\nWhether it’s the increasing automation of certain jobs, gender and racially biased algorithms or autonomous weapons that operate without human oversight (to name just a few), unease abounds on a number of fronts. And we’re still in the very early stages of what AI is really capable of.\n\n14 Dangers of AI\n\nQuestions about who’s developing AI and for what purposes make it all the more essential to understand its potential downsides. Below we take a closer look at the possible dangers of artificial intelligence and explore how to manage its risks.\n\n1. Lack of AI Transparency and Explainability\n\nAI and deep learning models can be difficult to understand, even for those who work directly with the technology. This leads to a lack of transparency for how and why AI comes to its conclusions, creating a lack of explanation for what data AI algorithms use, or why they may make biased or unsafe decisions. These concerns have given rise to the use of explainable AI, but there’s still a long way before transparent AI systems become common practice.\n\nTo make matters worse, AI companies continue to remain tight-lipped about their products. Former employees of OpenAI and Google DeepMind have accused both companies of concealing the potential dangers of their AI tools. This secrecy leaves the general public unaware of possible threats and makes it difficult for lawmakers to take proactive measures ensuring AI is developed responsibly.\n\n2. Job Losses Due to AI Automation\n\nAI-powered job automation is a pressing concern as the technology is adopted in industries like marketing, manufacturing and healthcare. By 2030, tasks that account for up to 30 percent of hours currently being worked in the U.S. economy could be automated — with Black and Hispanic employees left especially vulnerable to the change — according to McKinsey. Goldman Sachs even states 300 million full-time jobs could be lost to AI automation.\n\n“The reason we have a low unemployment rate, which doesn’t actually capture people that aren’t looking for work, is largely that lower-wage service sector jobs have been pretty robustly created by this economy,” futurist Martin Ford told Built In. With AI on the rise, though, “I don’t think that’s going to continue.”\n\nAs AI robots become smarter and more dexterous, the same tasks will require fewer humans. And while AI is estimated to create 97 million new jobs by 2025, many employees won’t have the skills needed for these technical roles and could get left behind if companies don’t upskill their workforces.\n\n“If you’re flipping burgers at McDonald’s and more automation comes in, is one of these new jobs going to be a good match for you?” Ford said. “Or is it likely that the new job requires lots of education or training or maybe even intrinsic talents — really strong interpersonal skills or creativity — that you might not have? Because those are the things that, at least so far, computers are not very good at.”\n\nAs technology strategist Chris Messina has pointed out, fields like law and accounting are primed for an AI takeover as well. In fact, Messina said, some of them may well be decimated. AI already is having a significant impact on medicine. Law and accounting are next, Messina said, the former being poised for “a massive shakeup.”\n\n“It’s a lot of attorneys reading through a lot of information — hundreds or thousands of pages of data and documents. It’s really easy to miss things,” Messina said. “So AI that has the ability to comb through and comprehensively deliver the best possible contract for the outcome you’re trying to achieve is probably going to replace a lot of corporate attorneys.”\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceAI Copywriting: Why Writing Jobs Are Safe\n\n3. Social Manipulation Through AI Algorithms\n\nSocial manipulation also stands as a danger of artificial intelligence. This fear has become a reality as politicians rely on platforms to promote their viewpoints, with one example being Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., wielding a TikTok troll army to capture the votes of younger Filipinos during the Philippines’ 2022 election.\n\nTikTok, which is just one example of a social media platform that relies on AI algorithms, fills a user’s feed with content related to previous media they’ve viewed on the platform. Criticism of the app targets this process and the algorithm’s failure to filter out harmful and inaccurate content, raising concerns over TikTok’s ability to protect its users from misleading information.\n\nOnline media and news have become even murkier in light of AI-generated images and videos, AI voice changers as well as deepfakes infiltrating political and social spheres. These technologies make it easy to create realistic photos, videos, audio clips or replace the image of one figure with another in an existing picture or video. As a result, bad actors have another avenue for sharing misinformation and war propaganda, creating a nightmare scenario where it can be nearly impossible to distinguish between credible and faulty news.\n\n“No one knows what’s real and what’s not,” Ford said. “You literally cannot believe your own eyes and ears; you can’t rely on what, historically, we’ve considered to be the best possible evidence ... That’s going to be a huge issue.”\n\n4. Social Surveillance With AI Technology\n\nIn addition to its more existential threat, Ford is focused on the way AI will adversely affect privacy and security. A prime example is China’s use of facial recognition technology in offices, schools and other venues. Besides tracking a person’s movements, the Chinese government may be able to gather enough data to monitor a person’s activities, relationships and political views.\n\nAnother example is U.S. police departments embracing predictive policing algorithms to anticipate where crimes will occur. The problem is that these algorithms are influenced by arrest rates, which disproportionately impact Black communities. Police departments then double down on these communities, leading to over-policing and questions over whether self-proclaimed democracies can resist turning AI into an authoritarian weapon.\n\n“Authoritarian regimes use or are going to use it,” Ford said. “The question is, ‘How much does it invade Western countries, democracies, and what constraints do we put on it?’”\n\nRelatedAre Police Robots the Future of Law Enforcement?\n\n5. Lack of Data Privacy Using AI Tools\n\nA 2024 AvePoint survey found that the top concern among companies is data privacy and security. And businesses may have good reason to be hesitant, considering the large amounts of data concentrated in AI tools and the lack of regulation regarding this information.\n\nAI systems often collect personal data to customize user experiences or to help train the AI models you’re using (especially if the AI tool is free). Data may not even be considered secure from other users when given to an AI system, as one bug incident that occurred with ChatGPT in 2023 “allowed some users to see titles from another active user’s chat history.” While there are laws present to protect personal information in some cases in the United States, there is no explicit federal law that protects citizens from data privacy harm caused by AI.\n\nRelated ReadingAI-Generated Content and Copyright Law: What We Know\n\n6. Biases Due to AI\n\nVarious forms of AI bias are detrimental too. Speaking to the New York Times, Princeton computer science professor Olga Russakovsky said AI bias goes well beyond gender and race. In addition to data and algorithmic bias (the latter of which can “amplify” the former), AI is developed by humans — and humans are inherently biased.\n\n“A.I. researchers are primarily people who are male, who come from certain racial demographics, who grew up in high socioeconomic areas, primarily people without disabilities,” Russakovsky said. “We’re a fairly homogeneous population, so it’s a challenge to think broadly about world issues.”\n\nThe narrow views of individuals have culminated in an AI industry that leaves out a range of perspectives. According to UNESCO, only 100 of the world’s 7,000 natural languages have been used to train top chatbots. It doesn’t help that 90 percent of online higher education materials are already produced by European Union and North American countries, further restricting AI’s training data to mostly Western sources.\n\nThe limited experiences of AI creators may explain why speech-recognition AI often fails to understand certain dialects and accents, or why companies fail to consider the consequences of a chatbot impersonating historical figures. If businesses and legislators don’t exercise greater care to avoid recreating powerful prejudices, AI biases could spread beyond corporate contexts and exacerbate societal issues like housing discrimination.\n\n7. Socioeconomic Inequality as a Result of AI\n\nIf companies refuse to acknowledge the inherent biases baked into AI algorithms, they may compromise their DEI initiatives through AI-powered recruiting. The idea that AI can measure the traits of a candidate through facial and voice analyses is still tainted by racial biases, reproducing the same discriminatory hiring practices businesses claim to be eliminating.\n\nWidening socioeconomic inequality sparked by AI-driven job loss is another cause for concern, revealing the class biases of how AI is applied. Workers who perform more manual, repetitive tasks have experienced wage declines as high as 70 percent because of automation, with office and desk workers remaining largely untouched in AI’s early stages. However, the increase in generative AI use is already affecting office jobs, making for a wide range of roles that may be more vulnerable to wage or job loss than others.\n\n8. Weakening Ethics and Goodwill Because of AI\n\nAlong with technologists, journalists and political figures, even religious leaders are sounding the alarm on AI’s potential pitfalls. In a 2023 Vatican meeting and in his message for the 2024 World Day of Peace, Pope Francis called for nations to create and adopt a binding international treaty that regulates the development and use of AI.\n\nPope Francis warned against AI’s ability to be misused, and “create statements that at first glance appear plausible but are unfounded or betray biases.” He stressed how this could bolster campaigns of disinformation, distrust in communications media, interference in elections and more — ultimately increasing the risk of “fueling conflicts and hindering peace.”\n\nThe rapid rise of generative AI tools gives these concerns more substance. Many users have applied the technology to get out of writing assignments, threatening academic integrity and creativity. Plus, biased AI could be used to determine whether an individual is suitable for a job, mortgage, social assistance or political asylum, producing possible injustices and discrimination, noted Pope Francis.\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceWhat Are AI Ethics?\n\n9. Autonomous Weapons Powered By AI\n\nAs is too often the case, technological advancements have been harnessed for warfare. When it comes to AI, some are keen to do something about it before it’s too late: In a 2016 open letter, over 30,000 individuals, including AI and robotics researchers, pushed back against the investment in AI-fueled autonomous weapons.\n\n“The key question for humanity today is whether to start a global AI arms race or to prevent it from starting,” they wrote. “If any major military power pushes ahead with AI weapon development, a global arms race is virtually inevitable, and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious: autonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow.”\n\nThis prediction has come to fruition in the form of Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems, which locate and destroy targets on their own while abiding by few regulations. Because of the proliferation of potent and complex weapons, some of the world’s most powerful nations have given in to anxieties and contributed to a tech cold war.\n\nMany of these new weapons pose major risks to civilians on the ground, but the danger becomes amplified when autonomous weapons fall into the wrong hands. Hackers have mastered various types of cyber attacks, so it’s not hard to imagine a malicious actor infiltrating autonomous weapons and instigating absolute armageddon.\n\nIf political rivalries and warmongering tendencies are not kept in check, artificial intelligence could end up being applied with the worst intentions. Some fear that, no matter how many powerful figures point out the dangers of artificial intelligence, we’re going to keep pushing the envelope with it if there’s money to be made.\n\n“The mentality is, ‘If we can do it, we should try it; let’s see what happens,” Messina said. “‘And if we can make money off it, we’ll do a whole bunch of it.’ But that’s not unique to technology. That’s been happening forever.’”\n\n10. Financial Crises Brought About By AI Algorithms\n\nThe financial industry has become more receptive to AI technology’s involvement in everyday finance and trading processes. As a result, algorithmic trading could be responsible for our next major financial crisis in the markets.\n\nWhile AI algorithms aren’t clouded by human judgment or emotions, they also don’t take into account contexts, the interconnectedness of markets and factors like human trust and fear. These algorithms then make thousands of trades at a blistering pace with the goal of selling a few seconds later for small profits. Selling off thousands of trades could scare investors into doing the same thing, leading to sudden crashes and extreme market volatility.\n\nInstances like the 2010 Flash Crash and the Knight Capital Flash Crash serve as reminders of what could happen when trade-happy algorithms go berserk, regardless of whether rapid and massive trading is intentional.\n\nThis isn’t to say that AI has nothing to offer to the finance world. In fact, AI algorithms can help investors make smarter and more informed decisions on the market. But finance organizations need to make sure they understand their AI algorithms and how those algorithms make decisions. Companies should consider whether AI raises or lowers their confidence before introducing the technology to avoid stoking fears among investors and creating financial chaos.\n\n11. Loss of Human Influence\n\nAn overreliance on AI technology could result in the loss of human influence — and a lack in human functioning — in some parts of society. Using AI in healthcare could result in reduced human empathy and reasoning, for instance. And applying generative AI for creative endeavors could diminish human creativity and emotional expression. Interacting with AI systems too much could even cause reduced peer communication and social skills. So while AI can be very helpful for automating daily tasks, some question if it might hold back overall human intelligence, abilities and need for community.\n\n12. Uncontrollable Self-Aware AI\n\nThere also comes a worry that AI will progress in intelligence so rapidly that it will become sentient, and act beyond humans’ control — possibly in a malicious manner. Alleged reports of this sentience have already been occurring, with one popular account being from a former Google engineer who stated the AI chatbot LaMDA was sentient and speaking to him just as a person would. As AI’s next big milestones involve making systems with artificial general intelligence, and eventually artificial superintelligence, cries to completely stop these developments continue to rise.\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceWhat Is the Eliza Effect?\n\n13. Increased Criminal Activity\n\nAs AI technology has become more accessible, the number of people using it for criminal activity has risen. Online predators can now generate images of children, making it difficult for law enforcement to determine actual cases of child abuse. And even in cases where children aren’t physically harmed, the use of children’s faces in AI-generated images presents new challenges for protecting children’s online privacy and digital safety.\n\nVoice cloning has also become an issue, with criminals leveraging AI-generated voices to impersonate other people and commit phone scams. These examples merely scratch the surface of AI’s capabilities, so it will only become harder for local and national government agencies to adjust and keep the public informed of the latest AI-driven threats.\n\n14. Broader Economic and Political Instability\n\nOverinvesting in a specific material or sector can put economies in a precarious position. Like steel, AI could run the risk of drawing so much attention and financial resources that governments fail to develop other technologies and industries. Plus, overproducing AI technology could result in dumping the excess materials, which could potentially fall into the hands of hackers and other malicious actors.\n\nHow to Mitigate the Risks of AI\n\nAI still has numerous benefits, like organizing health data and powering self-driving cars. To get the most out of this promising technology, though, some argue that plenty of regulation is necessary.\n\n“There’s a serious danger that we’ll get [AI systems] smarter than us fairly soon and that these things might get bad motives and take control,” Hinton told NPR. “This isn’t just a science fiction problem. This is a serious problem that’s probably going to arrive fairly soon, and politicians need to be thinking about what to do about it now.”\n\nDevelop Legal Regulations\n\nAI regulation has been a main focus for dozens of countries, and now the U.S. and European Union are creating more clear-cut measures to manage the rising sophistication of artificial intelligence. In fact, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) published the AI Bill of Rights in 2022, a document outlining to help responsibly guide AI use and development. Additionally, President Joe Biden issued an executive order in 2023 requiring federal agencies to develop new rules and guidelines for AI safety and security.\n\nAlthough legal regulations mean certain AI technologies could eventually be banned, it doesn’t prevent societies from exploring the field.\n\nFord argues that AI is essential for countries looking to innovate and keep up with the rest of the world.\n\n“You regulate the way AI is used, but you don’t hold back progress in basic technology. I think that would be wrong-headed and potentially dangerous,” Ford said. “We decide where we want AI and where we don’t; where it’s acceptable and where it’s not. And different countries are going to make different choices.”\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceWill This Election Year Be a Turning Point for AI Regulation?\n\nEstablish Organizational AI Standards and Discussions\n\nOn a company level, there are many steps businesses can take when integrating AI into their operations. Organizations can develop processes for monitoring algorithms, compiling high-quality data and explaining the findings of AI algorithms. Leaders could even make AI a part of their company culture and routine business discussions, establishing standards to determine acceptable AI technologies.\n\nGuide Tech With Humanities Perspectives\n\nThough when it comes to society as a whole, there should be a greater push for tech to embrace the diverse perspectives of the humanities. Stanford University AI researchers Fei-Fei Li and John Etchemendy make this argument in a 2019 blog post that calls for national and global leadership in regulating artificial intelligence:\n\n“The creators of AI must seek the insights, experiences and concerns of people across ethnicities, genders, cultures and socio-economic groups, as well as those from other fields, such as economics, law, medicine, philosophy, history, sociology, communications, human-computer-interaction, psychology, and Science and Technology Studies (STS).”\n\nBalancing high-tech innovation with human-centered thinking is an ideal method for producing responsible AI technology and ensuring the future of AI remains hopeful for the next generation. The dangers of artificial intelligence should always be a topic of discussion, so leaders can figure out ways to wield the technology for noble purposes.\n\n“I think we can talk about all these risks, and they’re very real,” Ford said. “But AI is also going to be the most important tool in our toolbox for solving the biggest challenges we face.”\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

In a jurisdiction that does not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for certain damages, the liability of Built In and the Contractors will be limited in accordance with these Terms to the extent permitted by law.\n\n5.3 Without limiting any of the foregoing, if Built In or any of the Contractors are found liable to you or to any third party as a result of any claims or other matters arising under or in connection with these Terms, the Site, or your use of the Site, the maximum liability for all such claims and other matters will not exceed $100 in any calendar year.\n\n6.INDEMNIFICATION\n\nYou agree to defend and indemnify Built In, and our officers, directors, managers, members, employees, representatives, and agents, against all claims, demands, suits, or other proceedings, and all resulting loss, damage, liability, cost, and expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), made by any third party arising out of: (a) the Content; (b) your violation of these Terms; (c) your violation of laws; (d) your violation of any rights of any third party; and (e) any unauthorized use of a username, password, or account number. We reserve, and you grant to us, the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you.\n\n7. DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\nExcept where prohibited by applicable law, this section addresses how any legal dispute between you and Built In will proceed in the unlikely event that such an event should occur.\n\n7.1 INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS\n\nIf you are you are dissatisfied with our Services for any reason, please contact us by email at customer[email protected] so that we can try to resolve your concerns without the need of outside assistance. If you choose to pursue a dispute, claim or controversy against Built In, these Terms will apply. For purposes of this dispute resolution process, Built In shall include our affiliates, employees, licensors, and service providers.\n\nBefore formally pursuing a Dispute (as defined below) in arbitration or small claims court, you agree to first send a detailed notice (\"Notice\") to Built In, Inc., by email at [email protected] or by mail at 222 Merchandise Mart Plaza Suite 2010, Chicago, Illinois 60654. Should Built In have a Dispute with you, Built In agrees to first send a Notice to you at your most recent email address on file with us, or if no email address is on file, using other contact information associated with your account. Any such Notice you provide must contain all of the following information: (1) your full name; (2) additional information that enables Built In to identify you, including your address, mobile phone number, and email address; and (3) a detailed description of your Dispute, including the nature and factual basis of your claim(s) and the relief you are seeking with a corresponding calculation of your alleged damages (if any). Built In’s Notice must likewise set forth a detailed description of its Dispute, which shall include the nature and factual basis of its claim(s) and the relief it is seeking, with a corresponding calculation of our damages (if any).\n\nYou and Built In agree to then negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve the Dispute. As part of these good faith negotiations, if Built In requests a telephone conference with you to discuss your Dispute, you agree to personally participate, with your attorney if you are represented by counsel. Likewise, if you request a telephone conference to discuss Built In’s Dispute with you, Built In agrees to have one representative participate. This informal process should lead to a resolution of the Dispute. However, if the Dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of a fully completed Notice and the Parties have not otherwise mutually agreed to an extension of this informal dispute resolution time period, you or Built In may initiate an arbitration (subject to a Party’s right to elect small claims court as provided below).\n\nCompletion of this informal dispute resolution is a condition precedent to filing any demand for arbitration or small claims court action. Failure to do so is a breach of this agreement. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines will be tolled while you and Built In engage in this informal dispute resolution process. Unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration provider, the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration and shall administratively close any arbitration unless the Party bringing such demand for arbitration can certify in writing that the terms and conditions of this informal dispute resolution process were fully satisfied. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this provision and to enjoin any arbitration proceeding or small claims court action.\n\n7.2 INDIVIDUAL RELIEF: CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER\n\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, YOU AND BUILT IN EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES IN COURT IN FAVOR OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PROVIDED ABOVE). YOU AND BUILT IN EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO FILE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER OR OTHERWISE TO SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS, INCLUDING ANY CURRENTLY PENDING ACTIONS AGAINST YOU OR BUILT IN. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, CONSOLIDATED, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS. THE ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THE SAME RELIEF AVAILABLE IN COURT PROVIDED THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY ONLY AWARD FINAL RELIEF (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE OR DECLARATORY RELIEF) IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE FINAL RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD FINAL RELIEF FOR, AGAINST, OR ON BEHALF OF ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS. IF A COURT DETERMINES THAT ANY OF THESE PROHIBITIONS IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE UNENFORCEABLE AS TO A PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF (SUCH AS A REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF), AND ALL APPEALS OF THAT DECISION ARE EXHAUSTED OR THE DECISION IS OTHERWISE FINAL, THEN YOU AND BUILT IN AGREE THAT THAT PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF SHALL PROCEED IN COURT BUT SHALL BE STAYED PENDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION OF THE REMAINING CLAIMS FOR RELIEF THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT. IF THIS SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION (EXCEPT FOR THE JURY TRIAL WAIVER AND THE INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS) SHALL BE NULL AND VOID. THIS PARAGRAPH IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.\n\n7.3 DISPUTE RESOLUTION THROUGH ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT\n\nAny dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Built In that is not resolved informally by Built In CustomerService or through the informal dispute resolution process that arises from or relates in any way to this agreement (including any alleged breach of this agreement), the Services, or our relationship with you (collectively, “Dispute”), shall be exclusively resolved through BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION except as specifically provided otherwise in this Dispute Resolution Section 7. “Dispute” as used in this agreement shall have the broadest possible meaning and include claims that arose before the existence of this or any prior agreement and claims that arise during the term of this agreement or after the termination of this agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Built In may elect to have an individual claim heard in small claims court. If the request to proceed in small claims court is made after an arbitration has been initiated but before an arbitrator has been appointed, such arbitration shall be administratively closed. Any controversy over the small claims court’s jurisdiction shall be determined by the small claims court. All other issues (except as otherwise provided herein) are exclusively for the Arbitrator to decide, including but not limited to scope and enforceability of this Dispute Resolution Section 7, as well as any request to proceed in small claims court that is made after an arbitrator has been appointed. If you or Built In challenges the small claims court election in your Dispute, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the small claims court election is unenforceable, then such election shall be severed from this agreement as to your Dispute. However, such court determination shall not be considered or deemed binding with respect to Built In’s other contracting parties.\n\nAny court proceeding to enforce this Dispute Resolution Section, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, must be commenced in accordance with the Jurisdiction section of these Terms. In the event this Dispute Resolution Section is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against Built In (except for small claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Delaware. You hereby irrevocably consent to those courts’ exercise of personal jurisdiction over you for such purposes and waive any claim that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.\n\n7.4 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ARBITRATION PROTOCOL\n\nThis subsection applies to Disputes that are submitted to AAA after fully completing the informal Notice and Dispute resolution process described above and when no small claims court election is made by either Party. Any arbitration between you and Built In shall be administered by AAA in accordance with the operative AAA Arbitration Rules (the \"AAA Rules\") in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with AAA, such as the Consumer Arbitration Rules or the Consumer Mass Arbitration Rules, as may be appropriate in the context of the dispute and as modified by this Dispute Resolution Section. For a copy of the AAA Rules, please visit https://www.adr.org/Rules or contact AAA [email protected]. If AAA is unable or unwilling to perform its duties under this agreement, the Parties shall mutually agree on an alternative administrator that will replace AAA and assume AAA’s role consistent with this agreement. If the Parties are unable to agree, they will petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an administrator that will assume AAA’s duties under this agreement.\n\nThe Parties agree that the following procedures will apply to any Arbitrations initiated under this Dispute Resolution Section:\n\nCommencing an Arbitration - To initiate an arbitration, you or Built In shall send to AAA a demand for arbitration (\"Demand for Arbitration\") that describes the claim(s) and request for relief in detail, consistent with the requirements in this agreement and AAA Rules. If you send a Demand for Arbitration, you shall also send it to Built In at Built In, Inc., 222 Merchandise Mart Plaza Suite 2010, Chicago, Illinois 60654, within 10 days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration to AAA. If Built In sends a Demand for Arbitration, we will also send it to your mailing address on file with us within the same 10-day period. If your mailing address is unavailable, we will send it to your email address on file, or if no email address is on file, other contact information associated with your account. The arbitration provider shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration and shall administratively close any such demand for arbitration that fails to certify in writing that the Party meets the requirements of this Dispute Resolution Section or if either Party elects small claims court as set forth above.\n\nFees – The payment of all fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules, except to the extent that the case is a part of a Mass Filing (as defined below) or the AAA fees and costs (including Arbitrator fees) paid by either Party are reallocated upon order of the Arbitrator following a determination that (a) either Party breached Dispute Resolution section of this agreement, (b) such reallocation is called for under this agreement, or (c) reallocation is otherwise permitted under applicable law. Upon a showing to Built In of your financial hardship we will consider a good faith request made by you to pay your portion of the applicable consumer portion of the filing fee. Built In is committed to ensuring that arbitration costs to consumers do not serve as a barrier to the adjudication of disputes. If Built In initiates an arbitration against you, we shall pay all fees.\n\nThe Arbitrator – The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral (the \"Claim Arbitrator\"), as assisted by any Process Arbitrator appointed under AAA Rules. (The term \"Arbitrator\" applies to both the Claim Arbitrator and the Process Arbitrator). If a hearing is elected by either Party, the Arbitrator shall be in or close to the location in which you reside. The Arbitrator is bound by and shall adhere to this agreement. In the event AAA Rules conflict with this agreement, the terms of this agreement shall control. If the Arbitrator determines that strict application of any term of this Dispute Resolution section of this agreement (except for the small claims election, which shall be determined by the small claims court) would result in a fundamentally unfair arbitration (the \"Unfair Term\"), then the Arbitrator shall have authority to modify the Unfair Term to the extent necessary to ensure a fundamentally fair arbitration that is consistent with the Terms of Use (the \"Modified Term\"). In determining the substance of a Modified Term, the Arbitrator shall select a term that comes closest to expressing the intention of the Unfair Term.\n\nDispositive Motions– The Parties agree that the Claim Arbitrator shall have the authority to consider dispositive motions without an oral evidentiary hearing. Dispositive motions may be requested under the following circumstances: (a) within 30 days after the Claim Arbitrator’s appointment, a Party may request to file a dispositive motion based upon the pleadings; and (b) no later than 30 days prior to the evidentiary hearing, a Party may request to file a dispositive motion for summary judgment based upon the Parties’ pleadings and the evidence submitted.\n\nDiscovery – Each Party may (a) serve up to five requests for relevant, non-privileged documents from the other Party; and (b) request that the other Party provide verified responses to no more than 5 relevant interrogatories (including subparts). Unless both Parties agree otherwise, no other forms of discovery (including depositions) may be utilized. Any such discovery requests must be served on the other Party within 21 days after the Claim Arbitrator’s appointment. The responding Party shall provide the requesting Party with all responsive, non-privileged documents, responses signed by the Party themselves to the requested interrogatories, and/or any objections to the requests within 30 days after receipt of the requests, or, in the event of an objection to any discovery request, 30 days after the Claim Arbitrator resolves the dispute. In the event either Party requests that the Claim Arbitrator consider a dispositive motion on the pleadings, such written discovery response deadlines shall be extended until 30 days following the Claim Arbitrator’s final decision on such dispositive motion. Any disputes about discovery or requests for extensions shall be submitted promptly to the Claim Arbitrator for resolution. In ruling on any discovery dispute or extension request, the Claim Arbitrator shall take into consideration the nature, amount, and scope of the underlying arbitration claim, the cost and other effort that would be involved in providing the requested discovery, the case schedule, and whether the requested discovery is necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim or defense.\n\nConfidentiality – Upon either Party’s request, the Arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either Party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal.\n\nArbitration Hearing – You and Built In are entitled to a fair evidentiary hearing (i.e. trial) before the Claim Arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings are usually simpler, less costly, and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. The Parties agree to waive all oral hearings and instead submit all disputes to the Claim Arbitrator for an award based on written submissions and other evidence as the Parties may agree, unless a Party requests an oral hearing within 10 days after the Respondent files a response. If an oral evidentiary hearing is requested, both Parties must be personally present at the hearing, regardless of whether either Party has retained counsel. Both Parties must personally attend the hearing. Either Party’s failure to personally attend the hearing, without a continuance ordered by the Claim Arbitrator for good cause, will result in a default judgment taken against that Party.\n\nArbitration Award – Regardless of the format of the arbitration, the Claim Arbitrator shall provide a reasoned decision, in writing within 30 days after the hearing or, if no hearing is held, within 30 days after any rebuttal or supplemental statements are due. The decision must clearly specify the relief, if any, awarded and contain a brief statement of the reasons for the award. The arbitration award is binding only between you and Built In and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different Party. The Claim Arbitrator may, however, choose to consider rulings from other arbitrations involving a different Party. The Arbitrator may award fees and costs as provided by the AAA Rules or to the extent such fees and costs could be awarded in court. This includes but is not limited to the ability of the Arbitrator to award fees and costs if the Arbitrator determines that a claim or defense is frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose, for the purpose of harassment, or in bad faith.\n\nOffer of Settlement – The Respondent may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer to the opposing Party any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the Claim Arbitrator until after the Claim Arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the opposing Party’s favor and is less than the Respondent’s settlement offer or if the award is in the Respondent’s favor, the opposing Party must pay the Respondent’s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney’s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the flipping of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs that claimant may be entitled to for the cause of action under which it is suing.\n\nMass Filing – If, at any time, 25 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against Built In or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities (\"Mass Filing\"), consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings set forth in the AAA’s Mass Arbitration supplemental rules and procedures (\"AAA’s Mass Filing Rules\", available at https://www.adr.org/Rules), the additional protocols set forth below shall apply.\n\nIf you or your counsel file a Demand for Arbitration that fits within the definition of Mass Filing referred to above, then you agree that your Demand for Arbitration shall be subject to the additional protocols set forth in this Mass Filing subsection. You also acknowledge that the adjudication of your Dispute might be delayed and that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled from the time at which the first cases are chosen to proceed until your case is chosen for a bellwether proceeding.\n\nAAA’s Mass Filing Rules shall apply if your Dispute is deemed by AAA, in its sole discretion pursuant to its Rules and this Dispute Resolution Section, to be part of a Mass Filing. Such election for AAA’s Mass Filing Rules and related fee schedule must be made by either you or Built In in writing and submitted to AAA’s and all Parties.\n\nBellwether Proceedings. Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by courts and arbitration administrators when there are multiple disputes involving similar claims against the same or related parties. Counsel for the Mass Filings claimants (including you) and counsel for Built In shall each select 15 Demands for Arbitration (30 total), and no more than 30 arbitrations shall be filed, processed, adjudicated, or pending at the same time, with each of the 30 individual arbitrations presided over by a different Claim Arbitrator, in a first set of bellwether proceedings. During this time, no other Demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed, adjudicated, or pending. If the Parties are unable to resolve the remaining Demands for Arbitration after the first set of bellwether proceedings are arbitrated or otherwise resolved, then counsel for the Claimants and counsel for Built In shall each select an additional 15 Demands for Arbitration (30 total) to be filed, processed, and adjudicated as individual arbitrations, with each of the 30 arbitrations presided over by a different Claim Arbitrator, in a second set of bellwether proceedings. During this time, no other Demands for Arbitration that are part of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed, or adjudicated. This staged process of bellwether proceedings, with each set including 30 Demands for Arbitration adjudicated on an individual basis, shall continue until each Demand included in the Mass Filings (including your Demand for Arbitration) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Fees associated with a Demand for Arbitration included in the Mass Filings, including fees owed by Built In and the claimants (including you), shall only be due after your Demand for Arbitration is chosen as part of a set of bellwether proceedings and therefore properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication. Any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning when you initiate the informal dispute resolution process set forth in subsection 7.1, and if the first Mass Filings’ Demands for Arbitration are chosen for the initial set of bellwether proceedings have been filed, your claims will remain tolled until your Demand for Arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled. A court of competent jurisdiction located in a venue allowed under Section 8 of the agreement shall have the power to enforce this subsection.\n\nYou and Built In agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of the arbitration and small claims court process and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Built In acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the fair resolution of genuine and sincere Disputes. The Parties further agree that application of these Mass Filings procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.\n\n7.5 FUTURE CHANGES AND RETROACTIVE APPLICATION\n\nThis Dispute Resolution Section 7 applies to all Disputes between the Parties, including for any claims that accrued against you or Built In prior to the time of your consent to this agreement and to any claims that accrue against you or Built In after your consent to this agreement. Notwithstanding any provision in this agreement to the contrary, you may elect to opt out of the retroactive application of this Dispute Resolution Section 7 as to claims that have accrued against you or against Built In prior to the time of your consent to this agreement in accordance with the opt-out instructions below.\n\n7.6 ARBITRATION OPT-OUT PROCEDURE\n\nYou may opt-out of this Dispute Resolution Section 7by sending us written notice, within 30 days of the time you consent to this agreement, to the following email address: [email protected]. Please do not direct any customer support inquiries to this address, as they will not be addressed; such inquiries should be directed to customer[email protected].

      "# [What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? by Ellen Glover on 2024-10-21](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence)\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to build machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI enables machines to simulate human abilities, such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making and comprehension. Common applications of AI include speech recognition, image recognition, content generation, recommendation systems and self-driving cars.\n\nWhile AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, advancements in machine learning and deep learning in particular are changing virtually every industry, making AI an increasingly integral part of everyday life.\n\nWhat Is Artificial Intelligence?\n\nArtificial intelligence refers to computer systems that are capable of performing tasks traditionally associated with human intelligence — such as making predictions, identifying objects, interpreting speech and generating natural language. AI systems learn how to do so by processing massive amounts of data and looking for patterns to model in their own decision-making. In many cases, humans will supervise an AI’s learning process, reinforcing good decisions and discouraging bad ones, but some AI systems are designed to learn without supervision.\n\nOver time, AI systems improve on their performance of specific tasks, allowing them to adapt to new inputs and make decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. In essence, artificial intelligence is about teaching machines to think and learn like humans, with the goal of automating work and solving problems more efficiently.\n\nHow Does AI Work?\n\nArtificial intelligence systems work by using algorithms and data. First, a massive amount of data is collected and applied to mathematical models, or algorithms, which use the information to recognize patterns and make predictions in a process known as training. Once algorithms have been trained, they are deployed within various applications, where they continuously learn from and adapt to new data. This allows AI systems to perform complex tasks like image recognition, language processing and data analysis with greater accuracy and efficiency over time.\n\nMachine Learning\n\nThe primary approach to building AI systems is through machine learning (ML), where computers learn from large datasets by identifying patterns and relationships within the data. A machine learning algorithm uses statistical techniques to help it “learn” how to get progressively better at a task, without necessarily having been programmed for that certain task. It uses historical data as input to predict new output values. Machine learning consists of both supervised learning (where the expected output for the input is known thanks to labeled data sets) and unsupervised learning (where the expected outputs are unknown due to the use of unlabeled data sets).\n\nNeural Networks\n\nMachine learning is typically done using neural networks, a series of algorithms that process data by mimicking the structure of the human brain. These networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or “neurons,” that process information and pass it between each other. By adjusting the strength of connections between these neurons, the network can learn to recognize complex patterns within data, make predictions based on new inputs and even learn from mistakes. This makes neural networks useful for recognizing images, understanding human speech and translating words between languages.\n\nDeep Learning\n\nDeep learning is an important subset of machine learning. It uses a type of artificial neural network known as deep neural networks, which contain a number of hidden layers through which data is processed, allowing a machine to go “deep” in its learning and recognize increasingly complex patterns, making connections and weighting input for the best results. Deep learning is particularly effective at tasks like image and speech recognition and natural language processing, making it a crucial component in the development and advancement of AI systems.\n\nNatural Language Processing\n\nNatural language processing (NLP) involves teaching computers to understand and produce written and spoken language in a similar manner as humans. NLP combines computer science, linguistics, machine learning and deep learning concepts to help computers analyze unstructured text or voice data and extract relevant information from it. NLP mainly tackles speech recognition and natural language generation, and it’s leveraged for use cases like spam detection and virtual assistants.\n\nComputer Vision\n\nComputer vision is another prevalent application of machine learning techniques, where machines process raw images, videos and visual media, and extract useful insights from them. Deep learning and convolutional neural networks are used to break down images into pixels and tag them accordingly, which helps computers discern the difference between visual shapes and patterns. Computer vision is used for image recognition, image classification and object detection, and completes tasks like facial recognition and detection in self-driving cars and robots.\n\nWhy Is Artificial Intelligence Important?\n\nArtificial intelligence aims to provide machines with similar processing and analysis capabilities as humans, making AI a useful counterpart to people in everyday life. AI is able to interpret and sort data at scale, solve complicated problems and automate various tasks simultaneously, which can save time and fill in operational gaps missed by humans.\n\nAI serves as the foundation for computer learning and is used in almost every industry — from healthcare and finance to manufacturing and education — helping to make data-driven decisions and carry out repetitive or computationally intensive tasks.\n\nMany existing technologies use artificial intelligence to enhance capabilities. We see it in smartphones with AI assistants, e-commerce platforms with recommendation systems and vehicles with autonomous driving abilities. AI also helps protect people by piloting fraud detection systems online and robots for dangerous jobs, as well as leading research in healthcare and climate initiatives.\n\nTypes of Artificial Intelligence\n\nArtificial intelligence can be classified in several different ways.\n\nStrong AI vs. Weak AI\n\nAI can be organized into two broad categories: weak AI and strong AI.\n\nWeak AI (or narrow AI) refers to AI that automates specific tasks. It typically outperforms humans, but it operates within a limited context and is applied to a narrowly defined problem. For now, all AI systems are examples of weak AI, ranging from email inbox spam filters to recommendation engines to chatbots.\n\nStrong AI, often referred to as artificial general intelligence (AGI), is a hypothetical benchmark at which AI could possess human-like intelligence and adaptability, solving problems it’s never been trained to work on. AGI does not actually exist yet, and it is unclear whether it ever will.\n\nThe 4 Kinds of AI\n\nAI can then be further categorized into four main types: reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind and self-awareness.\n\nReactive machines perceive the world in front of them and react. They can carry out specific commands and requests, but they cannot store memory or rely on past experiences to inform their decision making in real time. This makes reactive machines useful for completing a limited number of specialized duties. Examples include Netflix’s recommendation engine and IBM’s Deep Blue (used to play chess).\n\nLimited memory AI has the ability to store previous data and predictions when gathering information and making decisions. Essentially, it looks into the past for clues to predict what may come next. Limited memory AI is created when a team continuously trains a model in how to analyze and utilize new data, or an AI environment is built so models can be automatically trained and renewed. Examples include ChatGPT and self-driving cars.\n\nTheory of mind is a type of AI that does not actually exist yet, but it describes the idea of an AI system that can perceive and understand human emotions, and then use that information to predict future actions and make decisions on its own.\n\nSelf-aware AI refers to artificial intelligence that has self-awareness, or a sense of self. This type of AI does not currently exist. In theory, though, self-aware AI possesses human-like consciousness and understands its own existence in the world, as well as the emotional state of others.\n\nBenefits of AI\n\nAI is beneficial for automating repetitive tasks, solving complex problems, reducing human error and much more.\n\nAutomating Repetitive Tasks\n\nRepetitive tasks such as data entry and factory work, as well as customer service conversations, can all be automated using AI technology.

They can also derive patterns from a patient’s prior medical data and use that to anticipate any future health conditions.\n\nVisual Filters\n\nFilters used on social media platforms like TikTok and Snapchat rely on algorithms to distinguish between an image’s subject and the background, track facial movements and adjust the image on the screen based on what the user is doing.\n\nThe Rise of Generative AI\n\nGenerative AI describes artificial intelligence systems that can create new content — such as text, images, video or audio — based on a given user prompt. To work, a generative AI model is fed massive data sets and trained to identify patterns within them, then subsequently generates outputs that resemble this training data.\n\nGenerative AI has gained massive popularity in the past few years, especially with chatbots and image generators arriving on the scene. These kinds of tools are often used to create written copy, code, digital art and object designs, and they are leveraged in industries like marketing, entertainment, consumer goods and manufacturing.\n\nGenerative AI comes with challenges though. For instance, it can be used to create fake content and deepfakes, which could spread disinformation and erode social trust. And some AI-generated material could potentially infringe on people’s copyright and intellectual property rights.\n\nAI Regulation\n\nAs AI grows more complex and powerful, lawmakers around the world are seeking to regulate its use and development.\n\nThe first major step to regulate AI occurred in 2024 in the European Union with the passing of its sweeping Artificial Intelligence Act, which aims to ensure that AI systems deployed there are “safe, transparent, traceable, non-discriminatory and environmentally friendly.” Countries like China and Brazil have also taken steps to govern artificial intelligence.\n\nMeanwhile, AI regulation in the United States is still a work in progress. The Biden-Harris administration introduced a non-enforceable AI Bill of Rights in 2022, and then The Executive Order on Safe, Secure and Trustworthy AI in 2023, which aims to regulate the AI industry while maintaining the country’s status as a leader in the industry. Congress has made several attempts to establish more robust legislation, but it has largely failed, leaving no laws in place that specifically limit the use of AI or regulate its risks. For now, all AI legislation in the United States exists only on the state level.\n\nFuture of Artificial Intelligence\n\nThe future of artificial intelligence holds immense promise, with the potential to revolutionize industries, enhance human capabilities and solve complex challenges. It can be used to develop new drugs, optimize global supply chains and power advanced robots — transforming the way we live and work.\n\nLooking ahead, one of the next big steps for artificial intelligence is to progress beyond weak or narrow AI and achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI). With AGI, machines will be able to think, learn and act the same way as humans do, blurring the line between organic and machine intelligence. This could pave the way for increased automation and problem-solving capabilities in medicine, manufacturing, transportation and more — as well as sentient AI down the line. In a 2024 essay about the promises of the technology, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei speculates that powerful AI might accelerate innovation in the biological sciences as much as tenfold by enabling a larger number of experiments to be conducted at any given time, and by shortening the gap between new discoveries and subsequent research building on those discoveries.\n\nOn the other hand, the increasing sophistication of AI also raises concerns about heightened job loss, widespread disinformation and loss of privacy. And questions persist about the potential for AI to outpace human understanding and intelligence — a phenomenon known as technological singularity that could lead to unforeseeable risks and possible moral dilemmas.\n\nFor now, society is largely looking toward federal and business-level AI regulations to help guide the technology’s future.\n\nHistory of AI\n\nArtificial intelligence as a concept began to take off in the 1950s when computer scientist Alan Turing released the 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” which questioned if machines could think and how one would test a machine’s intelligence. This paper set the stage for AI research and development, and was the first proposal of the Turing test, a method used to assess machine intelligence. The term “artificial intelligence” was coined in 1956 by computer scientists John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester and Claude E. Shannon at a Dartmouth College academic conference.\n\nFollowing the Dartmouth College conference and throughout the 1970s, interest in AI research grew from academic institutions and U.S. government funding. Innovations in computing allowed several AI foundations to be established during this time, including machine learning, neural networks and natural language processing.\n\nDespite its advances, AI technologies eventually became more difficult to scale than expected and declined in interest and funding, resulting in the first AI winter until the 1980s.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, AI interest reawakened as computers became more powerful, deep learning became popularized and AI-powered “expert systems” were introduced. However, due to the complication of new systems and an inability of existing technologies to keep up, the second AI winter occurred and lasted until the mid-1990s.\n\nBy the mid-2000s, innovations in processing power, big data and advanced deep learning techniques resolved AI’s previous roadblocks, allowing further AI breakthroughs. Modern AI technologies like virtual assistants, driverless cars and generative AI began entering the mainstream in the 2010s, making AI what it is today.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

      "# [List of built by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2021-01-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_built-in_iOS_apps)\nApps pre-installed on the Apple iOS operating system\n\nApple Inc. develops many apps for iOS that come bundled by default or installed through system updates. Several of the default apps found on iOS have counterparts on Apple's other operating systems such as macOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS, which are often modified versions of or similar to the iOS application. As each app is integrated into the operating system itself, they often feature greater support for system features than third-party alternatives and are quick to adapt new features of iOS.\n\nApple has also included versions of iWork, iMovie, and GarageBand for free with new device activations since the release of iOS 7; however, these apps are maintained independently from the operating system, with updates instead released through the App Store.[1] Since iOS 10, most pre-installed apps have been removable.[2] With iOS 14 or later, as well as iPadOS 15 or later, users can hide pre-installed apps in the newly introduced App Library, as well as change their default web browser and email client to a third-party alternative. And with iOS 18.2 or later, Apple expanded the default apps that users can change to include apps such as messaging apps, password managers, and more.[3]\n\nApplications are listed below based on Apple's App Store developer page.\n\nApplications\n\n[edit]\n\nApp Store\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: App Store (Apple)\n\nThe App Store is a digital distribution platform which allows users to browse and download apps developed with Apple's iOS Software Development Kit.
