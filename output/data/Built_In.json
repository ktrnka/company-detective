      "# [Sales Industry Perspectives and Job Outlook](https://builtin.com/sales)\nWhat Is Sales?\n\nThe term “sales” usually encompasses any activities that assist in selling a product or service to a business or consumer. This term is intentionally broad and generalized. As with most industries today, sales is constantly growing and evolving in its scope and range. No longer are sales teams relying on cold calling for their next big sale. Today, salespeople learn skills, like marketing and data extrapolation, to target customers who are truly interested in their product or company. This method is proving to be much more efficient in forecasting and creating revenue for businesses, while being timesaving for salespeople.\n\nHow exactly does sales work? Every organization has its own method when it comes to selling. The sales branch of an organization is usually broken up into different teams that prospect, reach out to and converse with different groups of businesses (depending on the product and organizational structure). These teams can be grouped based on the size of the business they’re selling to (small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) or enterprises), the products they’re selling or even based on geographic region. No matter the case, sales teams are constantly meeting with customers either face-to-face (known as outside sales) or virtually through video or phone calls (referred to as inside sales) to build their sales pipelines.\n\nThe Sales Pipeline\n\nMost sales teams rely on sales pipelines to track the progress of their deals. The pipeline is essentially a set of stages that a prospect moves through on their journey to becoming a customer. The structure of a pipeline can differ from company to company, but they all track the same thing.\n\n1. Prospecting: The sales representative uses outside tools and digs deeper into a prospect’s background to determine if an individual or business had the need or budget to purchase what the salesperson is selling.\n\n2. Qualification: This is the step in which the salesperson determines if a prospect has the means to turn into a viable sales lead.\n\n3. Meeting: If determined to be a quality lead, a salesperson (or multiple salespeople) will reach out to the prospect to educate them on their products and meet with them to make business cases for why the prospect should purchase their product.\n\n4. Decision: The prospect either becomes a buyer or declines the offer. If they decide to buy, the sales team works tirelessly at identifying barriers that could potentially derail the deal: “Are any other competitors going to offer a better deal?” “Does the potential buyer have authority to make this purchase?” “Can this deal be thrown off by shifting priorities within the prospect’s organization?” These questions (and more) must be answered to get the sale across the finish line.\n\n5. Closing: The final terms are agreed to and the contract is signed. This is known as a “closed-won.”\n\nSales Skills\n\nWhat makes a great salesperson? Successful sales reps, engineers and managers are all highly-talented in both soft and hard skills. This means that high-performing salespeople have both “people skills” and the technical knowledge to provide a high value to potential customers. Below are just a few of many skills salespeople must have to be successful.\n\nRelationship Building\n\nA vital part of the whole sales process is building genuine relationships with customers. After all, you want to get to know who you’re working with and if their goals align with your products. Excelling at relationship building means you have superior active listening and conflict resolution abilities, as well as, the authentic ability to be empathetic towards a customer’s needs. This soft skill is vitally important in establishing the base of a fruitful relationship.\n\nProduct Knowledge\n\nLet’s face it, nobody is going to buy something from a person who doesn’t know the product they’re selling inside and out. Having the confidence to speak about your product, answer questions and dive into technical details will put a potential customer’s mind at ease. Knowing everything from pricing structure to how the product can fit into the customer’s roadmap will boost enthusiasm with prospects and turn more leads into sales.\n\nGoal-Oriented\n\nAll sales professionals must have a bit of a competitive drive in them so they can reach goals and drive revenue for their team. Successful salespeople establish themselves by setting tough, but attainable goals that help keep them focused, collaborative and hungry. You can set individual personal growth goals, like “participate in a sales workshop” or “expand my network by attending two events a month.” Or, you can set data-driven goals like “increase my quarter-over-quarter revenue by 20 percent.”\n\nProblem-Solving\n\nSales is a constant game of problem-solving and critical thinking. In one day, a salesperson might ask, “how do I interpret this sales data?”or “why is my high-priority customer saying they aren’t renewing our services?” Sales teams tackle these tough questions on a daily basis. It’s up to individual sales reps and managers to think quickly to ensure that revenue or customer relationships aren’t sacrificed.\n\nBest Sales Jobs Hiring Immediately NationwideView the Top Sales Jobs Hiring Now\n\nGetting Into a Sales Role\n\nSales is a diverse field, full of professionals who are motivated, focused and goal-oriented. The sector is diverse in job titles, responsibilities, specialties and career paths. It’s safe to say that there isn’t one way to get into sales, but past experience and a variety of both hard and soft skills will get you far.\n\nNowadays, most salespeople start out as sales development representatives and work their way up the ladder. These reps get a fantastic understanding of sales by researching quality leads, getting in touch with potential clients and preparing AEs for their sales pitches. SDRs are constantly digging into the data on CRMs, like Salesforce, or scouring other sources to find customers who are the right fit for a sales pitch. The outbound prospecting an SDR does is not only vital to the immediate success of a sales team, but to the SDR’s personal future in sales.\n\nIt’s also not unheard of for sales rookies to jump right into inside sales roles. Because the tech industry is booming, inside sales is actually the fastest-growing segment of the sales industry. Tech companies are always on the lookout for energetic and focused individuals who want to enhance their sales skills through this challenging position.\n\nNo matter what role you hop into in sales, it’s clear that in order to be successful, you have to sharpen your hard and soft skills. Not only do you need to keep up with the latest sales and marketing tools, but you have to also hone your abilities to come across as a “people person.” Having the ability to empathize with your prospect’s needs and then offer them a technical solution will take you far in the sales world.\n\nBest Sales Jobs Hiring Immediately NationwideView the Top Sales Jobs Hiring Now",
      "# [What Is Fintech?](https://builtin.com/fintech)\nFintech, short for financial technology, is a term used to describe the integration of technology into a financial service or process, with the goal of enhancing or automating it.\n\nMore broadly, the term fintech also encompasses a rapidly growing industry that serves the interests of both consumers and businesses in multiple ways. From mobile banking and insurance to cryptocurrency and investment apps, fintech has a seemingly endless array of applications.\n\nWhat Is the Importance and Impact of Fintech?\n\nThe rapid digitization, automation and enhancement of financial services has led to greater convenience for consumers.\n\nFor instance, neobanks — banks that operate exclusively online — enable customers to complete actions like ordering credit cards and opening savings accounts online without charging the same fees as traditional institutions. Other fintech products, like digital wallets and peer-to-peer payment apps, have made it easy for people to simplify payment processes.\n\nFewer fees and online access have made fintech a viable alternative for communities that have been traditionally underserved by the finance industry. Over 90 percent of Hispanic consumers use some kind of fintech, followed by 88 percent of Black consumers and 79 percent of Asian consumers.\n\nBusinesses have also embraced fintech and contributed to its growth. Financial institutions provide 24/7 customer service with chatbots and robo-advisors, insurers use AI-driven fintech products to assess risk and offer accurate premiums and businesses connect to investors and other sources of capital through lending platforms.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2023, the number of fintech unicorns ballooned from 39 to 272, and the market capitalization of fintech companies doubled.\n\nHow Does Fintech Work?\n\nFintech works by simplifying financial processes for consumers and businesses. When it comes to fintech apps, this is typically done through application programming interfaces (APIs), which enable communication between two applications to facilitate data sharing. This makes it possible for fintech products to automate fund transfers, analyze spending data and perform other tasks.\n\nFintech apps can then leverage users’ data in different ways, depending on their purpose. Insurance apps can access policy details to provide personalized advice, banking apps can connect to checking accounts to send digital payments and personal finance apps can monitor credit histories to track financial health.\n\nIn addition to standalone apps, fintech companies partner with other organizations to provide embedded financial services. Embedded finance integrates financial services into non-financial apps. Take Apple Wallet, for example. Through the collaboration of Apple with different companies, iPhones store information like credit card details for users to access digitally.\n\nFintech Industry Overview\n\nThe global fintech market continues to show promise and is set to surpass $882 billion by 2030. However, there have been plenty of growing pains along the way, most notably the FTX crypto exchange scandal and the Silicon Valley Bank collapse. Amid recent tensions and fears, fintech funding has slowed. But there’s reason to believe a rebound is on the horizon.\n\nDespite setbacks in 2023, customer growth rates have exceeded 50 percent across various industries and regions within the global fintech industry. The prospect of further combining fintech with artificial intelligence has produced even more excitement, expanding the possibilities for what fintech could look like in the years to come.\n\nTypes of Fintech\n\nFintech is reshaping every aspect of the traditional finance industry, including the following areas.\n\nBanking\n\nMobile banking is the central focus of many fintech companies. In the world of personal finance, consumers have increasingly demanded easy access to their bank accounts, especially on a mobile device. Most major banks now offer some kind of mobile banking feature, especially with the rise of digital-first banks, or neobanks. Neobanks are essentially banks without any physical branch locations, serving customers with checking, savings, payment services and loans on completely mobile and digital infrastructure. Some banks also allow third-party software applications to access a user’s financial information, which is called open banking. Some examples of fintech banks or neobanks are Chime, Current, Aspiration and Varo.\n\nPayments\n\nMoving money around is something fintech is very good at. The phrase “I’ll Venmo you” or “I’ll CashApp you” is now a replacement for “I’ll pay you later.” These are, of course, go-to mobile payment platforms. Payment companies have changed the way we all do business. It’s easier than ever to send money digitally anywhere in the world. In addition to Venmo and Cash App, popular payment companies include Zelle, Paypal, Stripe and Square.\n\nE-Commerce\n\nConsumers can break up payments through a ‘buy now, pay later’ setup supported by companies like Klarna and Affirm. In this scenario, customers pay off products by making smaller, interest-free payments. On the business side, companies can compile purchasing data to understand their customers and send them targeted ads and deals.\n\nStock Trading\n\nFintech companies have made stock trading and investing more affordable. For example, Robinhood doesn’t charge fees for opening and maintaining brokerage accounts while Public.com lets investors purchase portions of shares — known as fractional shares — to avoid hefty stock prices. With AI’s ability to process massive amounts of data, investment tools can also track and organize trading data based on user requests. Users can then filter stocks based on their preferences for faster purchasing.\n\nWealth Management\n\nAutomation simplifies the investing process for less-experienced individuals. Many companies employ robo-advisors that provide recommendations and even select stocks after users answer questions about their financial interests and risk tolerance. If users prefer to build their own portfolios, robo-advisors can still analyze a user’s stocks to offer feedback on managing risk. Companies that provide robo-advisors and automated investing include Wealthfront, Stash and Acorns.\n\nFintech Lenders\n\nFintech is also overhauling credit by streamlining risk assessment, speeding up approval processes and making access easier. Billions of people around the world can now apply for a loan on their mobile devices, and new data points and risk modeling capabilities are expanding credit to underserved populations. Additionally, consumers can request credit reports multiple times a year without dinging their score, making the entire backend of the lending world more transparent for everyone. Within the fintech lending space, some companies worth noting include SoFi, Funding Circle and Prosper Marketplace.\n\nInsurtech\n\nInsurance is a somewhat slow adopter of technology, and many fintech startups are partnering with traditional insurance companies to help automate processes and expand coverage. From mobile car insurance to wearables for health insurance, the industry is staring down tons of innovation. Some insurtech companies to keep an eye on include Lemonade, Kin and NEXT Insurance.\n\nRegtech\n\nRegulation technology (regtech) tools track and analyze transactions to alert companies of suspicious online activities. Coordinating with regtech companies, institutions can then quickly identify issues and take steps to counteract fraud, cyber attacks and other problems. Regtech companies can also assess an institution’s data to determine the risk of failure and make relevant suggestions. Big names in this space include ComplyAdvantage, Forter and Chainalysis.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency and blockchain intersect with fintech in a number of ways. For starters, several crypto trading platforms have emerged that allow users to trade different kinds of cryptocurrencies and take advantage of decentralized exchanges. And to keep people’s digital currency safe, a number of crypto wallets have sprung up as well. In addition, several fintech companies use blockchain technology for payment processing, money transfer and secure digital identity management. Some examples of cryptocurrency fintech companies include Coinbase, Blockfi and Circle.\n\nFintech Company Examples\n\nHere are a few more examples of fintech companies improving upon traditional finance with the help of technology:\n\nIntuit automates the tax process with individual-based products like TurboTax and small business-based products like QuickBooks.\n\nShopify makes e-commerce more convenient for business owners with Magic, an AI assistant that can generate product photos, write product descriptions and more.\n\nWealthsimple simplifies the investment process with its robo-advisor, which gathers input from users to match them with diversified portfolios that meet their criteria.\n\nUpstart enhances the loan process by using AI to pair lenders with borrowers who satisfy their requirements while also helping borrowers secure low-cost, fixed-rate loans.\n\nClearcover speeds up the claims process with AI technology and introduces a generative AI tool to further improve the claims experience.\n\nOnfido builds trust between institutions and customers with its AI-driven platform, which uses biometrics, customer information and other data to prevent fraud.\n\nInteractions between fintech companies and traditional financial players will continue to evolve as fintech regulations adapt to the latest technologies and strategies.",
      "# [What Is Aerospace? Aerospace Industry & Engineering.](https://builtin.com/aerospace)\nWhat Is Aerospace Engineering?\n\nAerospace engineering is the branch of engineering that works in the design, development, testing and production of airborne objects such as aircraft, missiles, spacecraft, rocket propulsion systems and other related systems. Aerospace engineering can either fall into the categories of aeronautical engineering or astronautical engineering.\n\nHistory of Aerospace Engineering\n\nEarly aerospace engineering and its concepts can be traced back to the late 19th century. The true birth of the aerospace industry, however, took place in 1903, when Wilbur and Orville Wright demonstrated the first example of an airplane capable of sustained flight. The brothers conducted extensive research and development, which led to a breakthrough in developing an onboard system that would allow pilots to control the warping of the plane’s wings for altitude control. The Wright brothers began licensing their technology to governments and military contractors, and by 1909, they were able to develop the first plane capable of flying faster than 40 miles per hour.\n\nFast forward through several years of development — bolstered by the emergence of both World War I and World War II, plus the introduction of commercial airliners in the 1930s — and the aerospace industry would continue to take shape well into the 1950s. Along the way, superpowered jets were produced as well as missile defense systems that would further revolutionize combat. During the late 1950s, a new goal of reaching yet another frontier — space — became increasingly realistic.\n\nThe Space Age was marked by fierce competition between the Americans and the Soviets, both aspiring to become the first to explore beyond the sky. The Soviets were the first to succeed with the launch of a small satellite, Sputnik, first entering orbit in 1957. Sputnik’s achievement was a result of the evolution of missile systems and used rockets of similar construction to boost small payloads past the atmosphere. The United States completed its first successful launch in 1958 with Project SCORE, successfully placing the first low-orbit communications satellite into orbit.\n\nSeveral additional satellites were launched and followed by the launch of the first successful human-piloted spacecraft to enter orbit, accomplished by Yury A. Gagarin aboard the Soviet Union’s Vostok 1. Since Gagarin’s orbit, there have been hundreds of successful missions to space completed by both manned and autonomous aircraft.\n\nModern successes of the aerospace industry include manned missions to the moon, the exploration of Mars by rovers, an intricate system of navigational satellites launched into space and the permanent installation of an International Space Station in orbit.\n\nModern aerospace developments and breakthroughs often fall into one of two categories: Aeronautical Engineering and Astronautical Engineering.\n\nAerospace Engineering Fields\n\nEnabling flight both above and below the atmosphere requires the cooperation and collaboration of engineering experts across multiple fields. Organizations within these fields are responsible for designing systems that are both compatible with existing technology and sustainable enough to remain in use without the need for constant redesigns. These systems are designed through rigorous research and development and built around several key aerospace engineering concepts. By studying these concepts, aerospace engineers can choose the field that they would most like to specialize in and take on a role in some of the most critical jobs.\n\nAerodynamics\n\nAerodynamics refer to how air moves and the interaction between the air and any solid masses passing through it. This is the foundation of aerospace engineering and provides a baseline for sustained flight.\n\nThermodynamics\n\nThermodynamics is the science of the relationship between heat, temperature, energy and output. This concept is key to mechanical engineering as it defines how heat is transformed into energy and creates mechanical output.\n\nRead MoreWhat Is a Drone? Drone Definition and Uses.\n\nCelestial Mechanics\n\nCelestial mechanics applies principles of physics to astronomical objects, including stars, planets, asteroids, and other organic material in order to project the motion of objects throughout outer space. Astronautical engineering relies on celestial mechanics to propel engines and avoid contact with objects in orbit.\n\nFlight Mechanics\n\nThere are four forces that play into successful flight: thrust, drag, weight and lift. All of these forces must be balanced and react to changes in any of the other forces to sustain flight. Thrust is the result of propulsion and is controlled by engines, propellers, or rockets; drag slows a flying object down; weight is the effect gravity has on an object; and lift suspends flying objects in the air, often through the use of wings.\n\nPropulsion\n\nPropulsion is the use of a system to drive or push an object forward. Thrust is a result of propulsion, crucial to acceleration and maintaining speed in any craft.\n\nAcoustics\n\nAcoustics principles within aerospace are applied when evaluating and addressing aeroacoustic noise in spacecraft, launch environments, engines, and propulsion systems due to aerodynamic flow. Proper acoustics are crucial to maintaining a safe and manageable environment for those near a flying craft and require careful consideration due to changing pressures that can create catastrophic failure.\n\nGuidance and Control Systems\n\nAll aerospace engineering concepts come into play when designing guidance and control systems, allowing pilots and controllers to adjust systems as needed to maintain flight. Guidance and control systems also utilize GPS navigation to ensure safe travel through low visibility environments.\n\nBest Aerospace CompaniesView Top Aerospace Companies Hiring Now\n\nAerospace Engineering Skills\n\nAerospace engineers should possess a deep understanding of several elements crucial to success in any aerospace field. These concepts, plus several others, are imperative to building successful systems and playing a role in the future of aerospace capabilities:",
      "# [Robotics: What Are Robots? Robotics Definition & Uses.](https://builtin.com/robotics)\nWhat Is Robotics?\n\nRobotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that produces machines, called robots, that replicate or substitute for human actions. Robots perform basic and repetitive tasks with greater efficiency and accuracy than humans, making them ideal for industries like manufacturing. However, the introduction of artificial intelligence in robotics has given robots the ability to handle increasingly complex situations in various industries.\n\nWhat Is a Robot?\n\nA robot is a programmable machine that can complete a task, while the term robotics describes the field of study focused on developing robots and automation. Each robot has a different level of autonomy. These levels range from human-controlled bots that carry out tasks to fully-autonomous bots that perform tasks without any external influences.\n\nIn terms of etymology, the word ‘robot’ is derived from the Czech word robota, which means “forced labor.” The word first appeared in the 1920 play R.U.R., in reference to the play’s characters who were mass-produced workers incapable of creative thinking.\n\nRobotics Aspects\n\nMechanical Construction\n\nThe mechanical aspect of a robot helps it complete tasks in the environment for which it’s designed. For example, the Mars 2020 Rover’s wheels are individually motorized and made of titanium tubing that help it firmly grip the harsh terrain of the red planet.\n\nElectrical Components\n\nRobots need electrical components that control and power the machinery. Essentially, an electric current — a battery, for example — is needed to power a large majority of robots.\n\nSoftware Program\n\nRobots contain at least some level of computer programming. Without a set of code telling it what to do, a robot would just be another piece of simple machinery. Inserting a program into a robot gives it the ability to know when and how to carry out a task.\n\nWhat Are the Main Components of a Robot?\n\nControl System\n\nComputation includes all of the components that make up a robot’s central processing unit, often referred to as its control system. Control systems are programmed to tell a robot how to utilize its specific components, similar in some ways to how the human brain sends signals throughout the body, in order to complete a specific task. These robotic tasks could comprise anything from minimally invasive surgery to assembly line packing.\n\nSensors\n\nSensors provide a robot with stimuli in the form of electrical signals that are processed by the controller and allow the robot to interact with the outside world. Common sensors found within robots include video cameras that function as eyes, photoresistors that react to light and microphones that operate like ears. These sensors allow the robot to capture its surroundings and process the most logical conclusion based on the current moment and allows the controller to relay commands to the additional components.\n\nActuators\n\nA device can only be considered to be a robot if it has a movable frame or body. Actuators are the components that are responsible for this movement. These components are made up of motors that receive signals from the control system and move in tandem to carry out the movement necessary to complete the assigned task. Actuators can be made of a variety of materials, such as metal or elastic, and are commonly operated by use of compressed air (pneumatic actuators) or oil (hydraulic actuators) but come in a variety of formats to best fulfill their specialized roles.\n\nPower Supply\n\nLike the human body requires food in order to function, robots require power. Stationary robots, such as those found in a factory, may run on AC power through a wall outlet but more commonly, robots operate via an internal battery. Most robots utilize lead-acid batteries for their safe qualities and long shelf life while others may utilize the more compact but also more expensive silver-cadmium variety. Safety, weight, replaceability and lifecycle are all important factors to consider when designing a robot’s power supply.\n\nSome potential power sources for future robotic development also include pneumatic power from compressed gasses, solar power, hydraulic power, flywheel energy storage organic garbage through anaerobic digestion and nuclear power.\n\nEnd Effectors\n\nEnd effectors are the physical, typically external components that allow robots to finish carrying out their tasks. Robots in factories often have interchangeable tools like paint sprayers and drills, surgical robots may be equipped with scalpels and other kinds of robots can be built with gripping claws or even hands for tasks like deliveries, packing, bomb diffusion and much more.\n\nHow Do Robots Work?\n\nSome robots are pre-programmed to perform specific functions, meaning they operate in a controlled environment where they do simple, monotonous tasks — like a mechanical arm on an automotive assembly line.\n\nOther robots are autonomous, operating independently of human operators to carry out tasks in open environments. In order to work, they use sensors to perceive the world around them, and then employ decision-making structures (usually a computer) to take the optimal next step based on their data and mission.\n\nRobots may also work by using wireless networks to enable human control from a safe distance. These teleoperated robots usually work in extreme geographical conditions, weather and circumstances. Examples of teleoperated robots are the human-controlled submarines used to fix underwater pipe leaks during the BP oil spill or drones used to detect landmines on a battlefield.\n\nTypes of Robotics\n\nHumanoid Robots\n\nHumanoid robots are robots that look like or mimic human behavior. These robots usually perform human-like activities (like running, jumping and carrying objects), and are sometimes designed to look like us, even having human faces and expressions. Two of the most prominent examples of humanoid robots are Hanson Robotics’ Sophia and Boston Dynamics’ Atlas.\n\nCobots\n\nCobots, or collaborative robots, are robots designed to work alongside humans. These robots prioritize safety by using sensors to remain aware of their surroundings, executing slow movements and ceasing actions when their movements are obstructed. Cobots typically perform simple tasks, freeing up humans to address more complex work.\n\nIndustrial Robots\n\nIndustrial robots automate processes in manufacturing environments like factories and warehouses. Possessing at least one robotic arm, these robots are made to handle heavy objects while moving with speed and precision. As a result, industrial robots often work in assembly lines to boost productivity.\n\nMedical Robots\n\nMedical robots assist healthcare professionals in various scenarios and support the physical and mental health of humans. These robots rely on AI and sensors to navigate healthcare facilities, interact with humans and execute precise movements. Some medical robots can even converse with humans, encouraging people’s social and emotional growth.\n\nAgricultural Robots\n\nAgricultural robots handle repetitive and labor-intensive tasks, allowing farmers to use their time and energy more efficiently. These robots also operate in greenhouses, where they monitor crops and help with harvests. Agricultural robots come in many forms, ranging from autonomous tractors to drones that collect data for farmers to analyze.\n\nMicrorobotics\n\nMicrorobotics is the study and development of robots on a miniature scale. Often no bigger than a millimeter, microrobots can vary in size, depending on the situation. Biotech researchers typically use microrobotics to monitor and treat diseases, with the goal of improving diagnostic tools and creating more targeted solutions.\n\nAugmenting Robots\n\nAugmenting robots, also known as VR robots, either enhance current human capabilities or replace the capabilities a human may have lost. The field of robotics for human augmentation is a field where science fiction could become reality very soon, with bots that have the ability to redefine the definition of humanity by making humans faster and stronger. Some examples of current augmenting robots are robotic prosthetic limbs or exoskeletons used to lift hefty weights.\n\nSoftware Bots\n\nSoftware bots, or simply ‘bots,’ are computer programs which carry out tasks autonomously. They are not technically considered robots. One common use case of software robots is a chatbot, which is a computer program that simulates conversation both online and over the phone and is often used in customer service scenarios. Chatbots can either be simple services that answer questions with an automated response or more complex digital assistants that learn from user information.\n\nRobotics Applications\n\nBeginning as a major boon for manufacturers, robotics has become a mainstay technology for a growing number of industries.\n\nManufacturing\n\nIndustrial robots can assemble products, sort items, perform welds and paint objects. They may even be used to fix and maintain other machines in a factory or warehouse.\n\nHealthcare\n\nMedical robots transport medical supplies, perform surgical procedures and offer emotional support to those going through rehabilitation.\n\nCompanionship\n\nSocial robots can support children with learning disabilities and act as a therapeutic tool for people with dementia. They also have business applications like providing in-person customer service in hotels and moving products around warehouses.\n\nHome Use\n\nConsumers may be most familiar with the Roomba and other robot vacuum cleaners. However, other home robots include lawn-mowing robots and personal robot assistants that can play music, engage with children and help with household chores.\n\nSearch and Rescue\n\nSearch and rescue robots can save those stuck in flood waters, deliver supplies to those stranded in remote areas and put out fires when conditions become too extreme for firefighters.\n\nPros and Cons of Robotics\n\nRobotics comes with a number of benefits and drawbacks.\n\nPros of Robotics\n\nIncreased accuracy. Robots can perform movements and actions with greater precision and accuracy than humans.\n\nEnhanced productivity. Robots can work at a faster pace than humans and don’t get tired, leading to more consistent and higher-volume production.\n\nImproved safety. Robots can take on tasks and operate in environments unsafe for humans, protecting workers from injuries.\n\nRapid innovation. Many robots are equipped with sensors and cameras that collect data, so teams can quickly refine processes.\n\nGreater cost-efficiency. Gains in productivity may make robots a more cost-efficient option for businesses compared to hiring more human workers.\n\nCons of Robotics\n\nJob losses. Robotic process automation may put human employees out of work, especially those who don’t have the skills to adapt to a changing workplace.\n\nLimited creativity. Robots may not react well to unexpected situations since they don’t have the same problem-solving skills as humans.\n\nData security risks. Robots can be hit with cyber attacks, potentially exposing large amounts of data if they’re connected to the Internet of Things.\n\nMaintenance costs. Robots can be expensive to repair and maintain, and faulty equipment can lead to disruptions in production and revenue losses.\n\nEnvironmental waste. Extracting raw materials to build robots and having to discard disposable parts can lead to more environmental waste and pollution.\n\nHistory of Robotics\n\nRobotics as a concept goes back to ancient times. The ancient Greeks combined automation and engineering to create the Antikythera, a handheld device that predicted eclipses. Centuries later, Leonardo Da Vinci designed a mechanical knight now known as “Leonardo’s Robot.” But it was the rise of manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution that highlighted the need for widespread automation.\n\nFollowing William Grey Walter’s development of the first autonomous robots in 1948, George Devol created the first industrial robotic arm known as Unimate. It began operating at a GM facility in 1959. In 1972, the Stanford Research Institute designed Shakey — the first AI-powered robot. Shakey used cameras and sensors to collect data from its surroundings and inform its next moves.\n\nThe ability of robots to perceive their surroundings led researchers to explore whether they could also perceive human emotions. In the late 1990s, MIT’s Dr. Cynthia Breazeal built Kismet, a robotic head that used facial features to express and respond to human emotions. This predecessor to social robots opened the door for future robots like Roomba and consumer-centric inventions like Alexa and other voice assistants.\n\nRobots took another leap forward in 2012 due to a breakthrough in deep learning. Armed with volumes of digital images, British AI expert Geoffrey Hinton and his team successfully trained a system of neural networks to sort over one million images while making few errors. Since then, companies have incorporated deep learning into their technologies, promising more possibilities for robotics.\n\n1700s\n\n(1737) Jacques de Vaucanson builds the first biomechanical automaton on record.

      "# [What Is Logistics? Logistics Definition and Examples.](https://builtin.com/logistics)\nWhat Is Logistics?\n\nLogistics is the process of coordinating how goods and products are obtained, stored and distributed. Manufacturers rely on logistics while overseeing complex operations in order to maintain efficiency, reduce costs and ensure that consumers’ needs are met.\n\nDue to the prominence of e-commerce companies, like Amazon, logistics embodies more than the actual movement of products from one place to another.\n\nLogistics Definition\n\nLogistics refers to the process of managing resources, including how they are transported, stored and received. Logistics often goes hand in hand with the global supply chain.\n\nAn important part of logistics is the steps taken in order to maximize customer satisfaction. This includes elements such as demand planning, order fulfillment, inventory management and customer service operations. These elements ensure that the goods consumers need are stocked and orders are fulfilled in a timely manner.\n\nLogistics management software has aided the expansion of what the logistics industry entails and how goods are brought to consumers. Some examples of software for the logistics industry include transportation management systems, enterprise resource planning software, yard management systems and warehouse management systems. The growth of this technology has created a need for specialized roles and companies focused on building and implementing logistics software.\n\nAs technology continues to transform our world, its influence on the logistics industry will only become greater, prompting a shift in how companies quickly and efficiently deliver their products to consumers.\n\nSupply Chain Management vs. Logistics\n\nSupply chain management and logistics are often thought of as one in the same, but the terms actually capture two distinct parts of what it means to move resources.\n\nSupply chain management is the larger network that connects global vendors, transportation companies, distributors and warehouses. This network functions as the framework that logistics works under.\n\nLogistics is the process companies undertake to deliver goods to consumers. This process involves purchasing and delivering materials, packaging and shipping goods as well as transporting goods and products to distributors.\n\nWhy Logistics Is Important\n\nLogistics may not be the first thing that comes to mind when a purchase is made online or in a brick-and-mortar store, but it is undeniably intertwined with everything we buy. Logistical considerations affect global supply chains, what items are in stock and when as well as where manufacturers chose to build their facilities. These influences are just one way that logistics displays importance in our global economy.\n\nUtilizing logistics properly is essential to the function of businesses across the globe — and effectively managed logistics typically leads to positive business outcomes. With the growing complexity of the global supply chain, properly implemented and managed logistics are more important than ever.\n\nThe importance of logistics also stretches to simplifying communication and reducing costs. Effective logistics help foster relationships between suppliers, shipping services and warehousers through automated systems. The connectivity of logistics improves delivery and fulfillment of orders, which in turn reduces overhead costs. Costs are also reduced by the ability to use logistical systems to purchase goods based on supply forecasts and improved inventory management.\n\nBest Logistics Companies Hiring for Open RolesView Top Logistics Companies Hiring Now\n\nTypes of Logistics\n\nThe logistics industry has transformed over the past century. During the 1960s, the supply chain was indelibly changed when IBM developed the world’s first computerized inventory management and forecasting system, which made it simpler to track orders, inventory and distribution. Since then, the industry has been propelled even further into the future, bringing with it an entirely new perspective on how we exchange goods across the globe.\n\nTypes of Logistics Companies\n\ne-Commerce logistics\n\nFreight logistics\n\nThird-party logistics\n\nCarrier logistics\n\nFreight forwarders\n\nToday, the logistics realm is heavily influenced by AI and machine learning, which many logistics companies use to offer more accurate forecasting and enhanced order management. With these technological advances and more, the supply chain has been given the chance to prosper worldwide.\n\nLogistics in e-Commerce\n\nGiven the rise of e-commerce and the rapid growth of the online ordering space, logistics has become one of the world’s fastest-growing industries. Many organizations have emerged in response to logistics’ continuous transformation, dedicated to optimizing the supply chain in unimaginable ways. Perhaps the most well-known logistics leader to have emerged over the past few decades is e-commerce giant Amazon. While Amazon was initially founded as an online marketplace for books, the company has become a household name across the globe, altering the way in which products are transported and delivered to consumers.\n\nAmazon has become famous for its logistics strategy, which is made possible by the company’s global network of distribution, sortation and fulfillment centers. Amazon’s same-day and next-day delivery model rests on a complex logistics framework. Products are delivered to the company’s fulfillment centers before being moved to sortation centers. Once goods have made it through Amazon’s sortation centers, they are loaded onto a wide range of transportation modes, which can include the company’s own fleet of delivery trucks and airplanes.\n\nThird-Party Logistics\n\nAmazon has entirely redefined the logistics landscape, yet it’s not the only major third party logistics (3PL) provider making waves. Companies like UPS and FedEx have played a significant role in the transformation of logistics. These companies are capable of transporting goods from their point of origin, warehousing products and packaging them. Working with 3PL providers offers numerous advantages for both small and large businesses including the ability to obtain better rates, easily expand into new markets and improve customer service.\n\nLogistics in Freight Shipping\n\nWhile 3PL providers are capable of handling the entirety of a company’s supply chain operations, the different components of the logistics process can be carried out by individual players. For instance, freight companies solely handle the physical transportation of goods, while freight forwarders are dedicated to optimizing transport solutions and handling necessary documentation. In this sense, logistics could be seen as a complex web of moving parts, which operate in tandem with one another in order to boost efficiency and reduce costs within the supply chain.\n\nBy way of example, Flexport has developed an operating model designed to simplify global freight forwarding, while Transfix has created a marketplace that connects shippers with a national network of carriers.\n\nRead NextFragmented Tech Is the Way Forward in Hospitality\n\nLogistic Tech Developments\n\nGiven the logistics industry’s seemingly endless transformation, logistics management is naturally made up of many different elements. These components include the planning, procurement and coordination of manufacturing materials, strategizing the development of a product and reclaiming materials and supplies involved in the manufacturing of a product. For logistics managers, keeping track of the many different aspects of a supply chain can be nearly impossible. Luckily, logistics tech has successfully reshaped the industry, turning it into a robust sector fueled by the rise of innovative new technologies.\n\nTop Logistics Tech Companies\n\nFourKites\n\nproject44\n\nMotive\n\nZipline\n\nFlexport\n\nTransfix\n\nArrive Logistics\n\nAI and Optimization in Logistics\n\nAs the demand for online delivery grows and consumers’ expectations become larger, the need to optimize logistics has never been greater. As a result, software developers have set to work creating platforms designed to make the supply chain more manageable. Real-time visibility software providers such as FourKites, project44 and FreightVerify empower supply chain operators to simply identify issues and quickly resolve them, saving organizations huge amounts of time during which they can focus on other aspects of the logistics process. Likewise, fleet management company Motive has made it easier to track cargo and drivers while improving efficiency and safety along the supply chain.\n\nConsidering all of the work that goes into Amazon’s e-commerce services, it may come as no surprise that the company relies heavily on the latest technology in order to accomplish its consumer delivery goals. Amazon has been using AI to power its product recommendations for years. The company has also adopted machine learning to build the handheld virtual assistant, Amazon Echo.\n\nWarehouse Automation in Logistics\n\nAmazon doesn’t solely use technology to maximize the customer experience. In fact, the company’s technological expertise extends to its packaging and delivery services. The e-commerce company made headlines in 2012 when it introduced automation into its supply chain upon acquiring Kiva Systems. Today, Amazon’s warehouses are filled with thousands of robots built to optimize the picking and packing process.\n\nAmazon isn’t the only logistics leader that has unlocked the potential of robotics. In fact, the warehouse automation space has grown tremendously over the past several years and is expected to become increasingly more valuable over time. The growth of this sector is attributed largely to the steady rise of e-commerce, which has ignited the need to send products out quickly while lowering operating costs. The popularity of online grocery shopping in particular has bolstered the growth of warehouse automation, as online grocery retailers have been forced to meet consumers’ ever-increasing demands while competing with brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles in Logistics\n\nAs warehouse automation continues to infiltrate the logistics industry, autonomous vehicles are becoming a supply chain essential. For companies like Amazon, self-driving vehicles are not only profitable within the warehouse, as they harbor the potential to make on-road delivery faster and more efficient. Companies like Starship Technologies are developing revolutionary new ways to autonomously transport goods, thus unleashing new possibilities within the logistics realm.\n\nDrones in Logistics\n\nAlongside the emergence of autonomous vehicles, the commercial use of drones has opened up new avenues for supply chain management. Within a warehouse setting, drones can be used for aerial inspection and can even carry out maintenance requests, all of which can save manufacturers vast amounts of time.\n\nGiven drones’ ability to quickly transport small items, many tech companies are trying their hand at developing aerial transportation modes. For instance, logistics startup Zipline has created unmanned drones designed to quickly deliver goods, reduce emissions and integrate with existing operations.\n\n3D Printing in Logistics\n\nWhile there are many options when it comes to packaging and delivering goods quickly, supply chain experts are still searching for ways to manufacture products at a speed that meet consumers’ growing expectations. For this reason, 3D printing has entered the logistics space as a possible solution. The process of gathering supplies and producing a product often requires the most time and effort within the supply chain setting.\n\nIf 3D printing were applied to the production process, consumers would have greater control over the supply chain. Potentially, a consumer could place an order for a product and then a local 3D printer shop would quickly create the product before sending it out for delivery. 3D printing could ultimately disrupt the logistics industry, as it offers manufacturers the opportunity to produce complex and customized goods faster than ever before.",

      "# [What Is Wearable Technology? Examples of Wearables](https://builtin.com/wearables)\nWhat Is Wearable Technology?\n\nIt seems like everything nowadays is a smart device. Smart toasters. Smart dog collars. Smart homes. In the age of smart, there is nothing more intelligent or more innovative than the devices being produced by the wearables industry.\n\nWearable devices help collect and analyze real-time personal data that informs us on everything from our health to our workouts. They’ve become extremely popular tools to help us stay informed and in touch with ourselves to the point that almost a quarter of people in the U.S. now sport a wearable device.\n\nWhat Are Wearables?\n\nWearables make up a broad category that includes any device worn or attached to a user’s body. Smart watches, VR headsets and wearable electrocardiograms are a few examples. These devices support purposes related to areas like health and fitness, entertainment and everyday use.\n\nWhat exactly is a wearable? Wearables are electronic devices that are worn on a person — usually close to the skin — in order to accurately relay important medical, biological and exercise data to a database.\n\nWearables have helped make the IoT industry the $594 billion dollar behemoth it is today (the wearables industry itself is expected to balloon to $111 billion by 2027). Apple Watches and Fitbits are classic examples of wearable technology, but those aren’t the only devices being developed today. In addition to smart watches, VR and AR technology, smart jackets and a wide variety of other gadgets are leading us towards a better-connected lifestyle. Each device’s main job is to collect millions of data points that range from how many steps you take to your heart rate.\n\nBenefits of Wearables\n\nThe advancement of wearables has been a welcomed tool for the insurance, healthcare and sports industries for a number of reasons. From encouraging healthier habits to optimizing physical performance, industries have reaped numerous rewards that come with wearable tech.\n\nWearables Improve Healthcare\n\nThe healthcare industry is probably seeing the biggest benefit from wearable technology. Patients who wear these smart devices can measure information ranging from body temperature to blood pressure, which is then relayed to their medical team in real-time. If something looks off, doctors have a quicker way to accurately diagnose and treat a patient. The entire treatment process is now quicker thanks to the data collected by a wearable device because doctors no longer have to run a gamut of tests to determine an illness or disease. They can reference the data collected by a wearable to quickly figure out the cause of the medical mishap.\n\nBest Wearables Companies Hiring NowView the Top Wearables Companies With Open Jobs\n\nWearables Provide More Insights Into Sports and Fitness Performance\n\nHaving all of this health data in real-time is, of course, helping the sports and fitness industries push the boundaries of training. Professional athletes from all over the world maximize their training regimes thanks to the biometric data captured through wearable technology. Elite athletes, from marathon runners to the Golden State Warriors and Liverpool FC, are using smart compression shirts to maximize every move an athlete makes. These smart shirts use a combination of GPS, accelerometers and biomedical sensors to constantly measure the performance of each athlete. Is Liverpool superstar Mo Salah taking the optimal route to a ball? Is NBA all-star Steph Curry maximizing his hydration levels to perform at his peak ability? How can MLB players, like Mike Trout or Kris Bryant, maximize their acceleration out of the batter’s box? Wearable technology is the key to answering these questions and unlocking the optimal potential of world-class athletes.\n\nWearables Increase the Productivity and Health of Workforces\n\nThe business world has benefited from the introduction of wearables to its workforce. Seventy-nine percent of employees who wear a smart device in the office report that the devices are instrumental to their work. Equipping a workforce with wearable devices makes sense for employers. These devices enhance communication, track employee activity, boost job site safety measures and can actually improve the health and quality of life for a workforce. A healthier, happier workforce will then lead to higher rates of employee retention, saving companies thousands, if not millions, of dollars annually.\n\nExamples of Wearable Technologies\n\nHealth and Fitness Wearables\n\nWearables are often associated with the health and wellness sectors. Smart watches, like a Fitbit or Apple Watch, have pioneered the way we track everything from heart rates to our daily steps. Constantly checking in with them has become part of a daily routine for many.\n\nThese watches inherently encourage healthier lifestyles because of the data they collect. Knowing how far you run encourages you to push yourself further to beat your old record. Seeing that you’re almost to your daily 10,000-step goal encourages you to go for a walk around the block. Even tracking your current sleep habits could lead to changes that help you sleep more soundly at night. In a sense, wearable tech is one of the best ways to gamify the health and wellness journey.\n\nLife Insurance Wearables\n\nIn order to promote healthier lifestyles, life insurance companies issue wearables to their customers, who then track their health data. Devices like smart watches and fitness trackers provide details on someone’s activity levels, heart rate and other important health data points. The data collected informs premium prices and can paint a more accurate picture about the overall health of life insurance customers. It’s a much more concrete method rather than relying on a vague metric, such as one’s age, when creating an individual policy.\n\nGaming Wearables\n\nGaming is one of the biggest frontiers for wearable technology. Virtual reality (VR) headsets are the most common form of wearable devices in the industry. VR headsets, like the Oculus Rift or the Playstation VR, instantly immerse gamers in other-worldly experiences from the second they strap in. Do you want to know how it would feel to fight with Lightsabers? Maybe you really want to live out your adrenaline junky dreams of racing in the Indianapolis 500? VR wearables are bringing awe-inspiring experiences like these to gamers all over the world.\n\nWearable technologies taking off in the gaming industry are haptic devices. These smart wearables provide tactile feedback to a gamer in real time. This means that a device takes advantage of a gamer’s sense of touch by providing force or vibrations to a user. To put it simply, haptic vests, gloves or suits make gaming more realistic — a gamer can now feel actual recoil after shooting their virtual weapon or can even experience real feedback of what it feels like to dribble a virtual basketball. Though still in its infancy, haptic technology is poised to make the future of gaming, and wearables, more entertaining and realistic.\n\nFashion Wearables\n\nIt only makes sense that wearable tech has started to permeate fashion culture. Athletes wear full-body suits, equipped with hundreds of little IoT sensors, to measure their every move. The data gathered will help them to better optimize their swing, shot or kick. The consumer wearable technology clothing industry is still relatively new, albeit already intriguing. Smart jackets are being made to automatically cool or warm the body based on body temperatures taken from sensors throughout the jacket. Smart rings are giving people a stylish way to track their steps or measure their sleep habits. Our pants might one day become smart enough to use the thermal energy our bodies naturally produce to charge our cell phones. Wearable devices in fashion demonstrate that tech can be smart and sophisticated all at once.\n\nTravel Wearables\n\nThe ability of smart wearables to immerse users in virtual environments has made them a vital tool for the travel industry. With VR technology, companies can provide in-depth virtual tours of hotel rooms, local landmarks and other potential destinations. People can then make more informed decisions about where they choose to stay and visit, resulting in a higher-quality travel experience for customers.\n\nMany airlines also cater to wearable devices, allowing customers to store tickets and boarding passes in a digital wallet like Apple Wallet. If someone is wearing a smart watch, they can pull up any necessary passes for a faster entry and boarding process.\n\nEducation Wearables\n\nEducation has had to adapt to the digital age, and wearable tech has helped the industry catch up with the latest developments. Smart glasses and VR headsets enable organizations to train students and employees through simulations and virtual environments. Users are immersed in a real-life scenario, allowing them to spend more time learning by doing rather than listening to a lecture or presentation.\n\nIn addition, brain sensor headbands track when someone’s mind is stressed and relaxed. Educators can leverage this device to learn when students are pushing their minds too much and teach them how to remain calm while taking in new experiences and knowledge.\n\nLogistics Wearables\n\nAnother beneficiary of wearables is the logistics industry, which relies on wearable tech to develop more efficient operations. Smart glasses like Google Glass enable warehouse workers to quickly scan barcodes, pull up information from a database and make updates along the way. This process eliminates the need for workers to keep going back to a physical computer, saving them time as they organize packages and items.\n\nSome VR glasses go as far as to help workers determine their location in a large warehouse, mapping out the optimal route to travel between two points. These glasses can also reveal the best ways to organize packages for maximized storage without crushing lighter items. All these abilities make wearable devices a must-have for logistics companies.",
      "# [Finance Definition: Finance Industry, Skills & Jobs](https://builtin.com/finance)\nWhat Is Finance?\n\nFinance is a term that describes the business of managing money. It can refer to lending, investing, forecasting and any range of other activities related to the distribution and trading of financial assets. The business of finance can be separated into three categories: personal finance, corporate finance, and public finance.\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nPersonal finance describes anything relating to individual or family financial planning — mortgage borrowing, estate planning and retirement investing can all be grouped together as personal finance.\n\nCorporate Finance\n\nCorporate finance refers to how businesses and large enterprises maintain control over their spend, investments and shareholder value.\n\nPublic Finance\n\nPublic or government finance is characterized as the analysis of how funds can be allocated toward public interests, with which government entities can make decisions about trade regulations, taxes, and public expenditures.\n\nAs long as currency is exchanged, the financial industry will continue to flourish. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts overall employment for business and financial occupations will grow by roughly 7 percent between 2021 and 2031, resulting in an estimated 715,100 new jobs. The financial research organization Opimas discovered that around 35 percent of new job postings are for tech professionals and data scientists.\n\nCompetition for finding and keeping the best talent in finance has been heating up. Among hiring managers working to fill accounting and financial positions, more than 80 percent at public companies and roughly 69 percent at private companies said they’ll have to work hard to attract and retain employees. They identified the top three drivers of this urgency to be increasing workloads, the need for technological skills and attrition as a result of the Great Resignation.\n\nThe exponential growth in tech-related finance positions can be attributed to the growth of global capital as a whole. It has been estimated that there are over 3 million e-commerce companies headquartered across the globe, but that number doesn't begin to represent the innumerable ways that businesses, organizations and individuals exchange money digitally. As more players in the global economy move online, financial institutions need to be able to manage and transfer massive amounts of money both online and in person.\n\nNoteworthy Fintech Companies\n\nChime\n\nRiskified\n\nPaxful\n\nADP\n\nVerifi\n\nSpotOn\n\nSupernova Technology\n\nTech professionals, especially those skilled in computer programming and data science, enjoy a desirable status among finance world recruiters. It’s become second nature for banks to turn to automated technology for help processing vast data sets, and leaders in finance are constantly looking for new ways to employ AI and machine learning for maintaining security and forecasting market shifts.\n\nBest Finance Jobs NationwideView Top Finance Jobs Hiring Now\n\nHaving a bachelor’s degree in finance is among the top 15 college majors with the highest median earnings for degree-holders from 22 to 27 years old. Salary information collected by Built In shows the average yearly earnings for people working in the finance sector hover around $122,000. Common entry-level finance positions include junior accountant, budget analyst, financial analyst, personal financial advisor, financial auditor and credit analyst.\n\nTake a job like financial analyst, for example, and you’ll see the median annual wages sit at $95,570, while the median for all U.S. occupations is $45,760, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Earnings for financial and investment analysts can range from less than $60,000 to more than $166,000.\n\nA big factor in determining the average salary for a finance professional can be demand. For instance, in a city as bustling and competitive as New York, a higher-level job such as senior financial analyst can enjoy an average base salary of $108,313, compared to an overall national base salary average of $102,570.\n\nSkills Needed for a Job in Finance\n\nGreat Skills for Jobs in Fintech\n\nAccounting skills\n\nUnderstanding of forecasting and reporting\n\nKnowledge of finance software like QuickBooks\n\nData science programming languages like Python\n\nStrong attention to detail\n\nAbility to perform under pressure\n\nLike any other profession, a successful career in finance requires a combination of both soft and hard skills. Any aspiring finance professional must begin with a strong set of basic accounting skills. Since finance is primarily a numbers game, those looking to succeed in the industry have to have strong mathematics skills in order to understand cash flow, budgeting, and cost analysis. The need for market trend and spend forecasting makes a well-developed understanding of data science another essential hard skill. Additionally, today’s aspiring financial analysts are expected to have a level of comfort with programming and software, as more and more organizations employ platforms like QuickBooks and Python to conduct prediction models and develop future strategies.\n\nAs for soft skills, strong communication and stress management capabilities are key to building a good reputation in the finance world. Any top finance professional needs to be able to convey pertinent financial information to clients or managers through financial reports or presentations, and as such must be able to effectively articulate big trends or potential directions as succinctly and accurately as possible. Like any other job, finance professionals need to be able to perform under pressure and feel comfortable working with certain amounts of risk. In addition to this, due to the nature of finance and working with money, it's also important to maintain strong attention to detail and demonstrate high organizational skills.",
      "# [A Look Into the Gaming Industry: Types of Video Games and Gaming Jobs](https://builtin.com/gaming)\nGaming Industry Overview\n\nThe gaming industry, a current $200 billion behemoth, is arguably one of the most important and innovative sectors in tech today. Its importance to culture, social networking and entertainment cannot be understated. The term “entertainment industry” is no longer reserved for Hollywood and the movie industry because gaming is now providing one of the most immersive and awe-inspiring forms of entertainment to more than three billion people around the globe.\n\nNobody could imagine what the gaming industry would blossom into when they were messing around with Pong joysticks in their basements and competing against their friends for the highest Pac-Man scores in the 1970s and ‘80s. These simple games would turn out to be the bedrock of today’s gaming industry and instant cultural phenomena.\n\nPioneered by evergrowing gaming companies, the current gaming industry is pushing the boundaries of technology to create cutting-edge and highly immersive entertainment experiences. Not only do we have the continuous advent of new consoles, PCs and devices that are putting us right into the game, but we also have the opportunity to watch some of the best gamers in the world compete in the esports arena and online through streaming platforms like Twitch and Mixer.\n\nGaming Platforms\n\nThe gaming wars of today are just heating up. The battle over console gaming is being waged by Microsoft (Xbox), Sony (Playstation) and Nintendo (Switch). These platforms are pushing the absolute boundaries of technology by offering gamers state-of-the-art graphics, speeds and processing powers.\n\nTraditional console makers, like Microsoft, will likely have to compete with cloud gaming platforms whose games available to those anywhere with any decent internet connection. Even Netflix is getting in on the gaming action. Additionally, PC gaming has opened up a world of opportunities for gamers who are looking for extra ease-of-use and dexterity when casually playing (or competing in) their favorite games.\n\nBest Gaming Companies With Open JobsView Top Gaming Companies Hiring Now\n\nEsports\n\nPicture your favorite sport. All sports, whether it’s soccer, basketball or baseball, have many things in common: passionate fans, sold-out stadiums, engaging commentators and world-class athletes. The same thing is true in the world of esports. esports athletes are essentially the Michael Jordans of their profession, but instead of dunking on opponents on a court, they’re outwitting, outmaneuvering and outplaying their opponents in virtual worlds. Thousands of screaming fans pack the arena to root on their teams who are sitting on stage clicking away for a chance at a title, while millions more watch online around the world.\n\nBy 2025, esports is projected to garner more than 640 million viewers worldwide, with about 318 million of those viewers specifically falling into the category of esports enthusiasts. With a growing fanbase that may rival any professional sport on earth, it’s no wonder that cultural icons and savvy investors, like basketball legend Michael Jordan, rapper Drake and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, all own at least partial stakes in esports teams.\n\nVideo Game Streaming\n\nStreaming has also been a massive success for the gaming industry and gamers alike. Platforms that support streaming like Twitch and Youtube Gaming give individual gamers the opportunity to livestream their in-game play to subscribers all over the world.\n\nThis innovation has allowed millions of streamers to gain a fanbase, interact with one another and monetize their gaming skills. Streaming has become uber-popular to the point where Twitch alone, the most-watched game streaming platform, garnered almost 1.5 billion minutes of watchtime in 2021. Breakout successes in the streaming industry, like Tyler “Ninja” Blevins, have been able to make upwards of $10 million a year just through the fans and endorsement deals that come with running a popular streaming profile.\n\nThe meteoric rise of the gaming industry is just getting started. Born from humble beginnings, today’s gaming sector is ready to take on any other in tech for the title of the most innovative industry. What makes gaming so special is that it’s not only immersive and entertaining, but it’s inclusive and expansive as well. There is a game and a way to play for almost every human, which makes gaming one of the most beloved industries in the world.\n\nGaming Equipment and Technology\n\nConsole Gaming\n\nConsole gaming is the original (and probably most well-known) form of digital gaming. In the early days, Nintendo and Sega dominated the market for consoles. Today, Xbox and Playstation have become the two most popular consoles, offering millions of players the ability to experience the latest in gaming technology.\n\nConsoles have been a good indicator of the tech market as a whole. In the beginning, consoles were simple joysticks just technologically-ept enough to run simple games like Pong. Now, consoles, like the new Xbox Series X, have specially designed microchips that process images and power as efficiently as possible, all the while, being designed for 8K television screens. Gaming consoles are truly pushing the limits of consumer entertainment technology.\n\nPC Gaming\n\nPCs have had a meteoric rise in gameplay with almost 1.8 billion people using computers as their gaming tool of choice by the end of 2022. Gaming computers are all about efficiency. Gaming PCs have their own dedicated RAM space, GPUs and cooling systems that help to efficiently run games in real-time. These bulked-up computers can handle graphically demanding games and can even make it easier for streamers who need a reliable system to manage gaming at a high level and livestreaming their gameplay at the same time. Games like Fortnite, League of Legends and Minecraft have made gaming one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world today.\n\nQuantum computing is a sector to look out for when it comes to gaming. Still in its infancy, quantum computing has the ability to completely upend the gaming industry (and world) as we know it. These computers dwarf anything that computers can do now, and this technology is primed to make an impact in the gaming industry. Because quantum computers have unfathomable amounts of power and information storage, they’re able to render the best graphics imaginable in real time. These computers also fix a huge problem currently plaguing the gaming industry; predictability. Who wants to play a game where they know exactly what happens? A quantum computer’s massive storage of algorithms could actually make gaming unpredictable and unique for each gamer.\n\nBest E-Sports Companies With Open RolesView Top E-Sports Companies Hiring Now\n\nCloud Gaming\n\nCloud gaming is the newest type of video game technology making headlines. Imagine Netflix, but for gaming. You scroll through a library of games, choose which game you want and automatically start playing the game. No discs and no load times. Play on your phone, iPad or console. Cloud-based gaming platforms aim to make the whole gaming experience seamless and easy to play from anywhere at any time.\n\nCloud gaming is such a threat to traditional console gaming that Microsoft’s head of gaming, Phil Spencer, stated that Xbox is no longer concerned about competition from Nintendo or Playstation in 2020. Rather, they’re more focused on competing with the ultra-fast cloud platforms being hosted by companies like Amazon and Google. It is worth noting, however, that Google’s cloud-based gaming platform, Stadia, is shutting down in 2023.\n\nVR/AR Gaming\n\nVirtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are meant to put you right in the middle of the action. Instead of playing from a third person point-of-view, VR drops people into computer-generated environments to make them feel like they’re actually part of the game. VR offers gamers the ability to step into magical worlds and do everything from kick around a soccer ball to fight off hordes of monsters (like in the video above). Additionally, being directly a part of these kinds of digital worlds has made the draw to the metaverse that more appealing.\n\nAugmented reality, on-the-other-hand, adds digital influences to real life. A popular example of AR in gaming is the mobile game Pokémon Go, in which smartphone cameras are used to find and capture virtual creatures in the real world. Gamers might come across a Pikachu in the park or even find a Wartortle on their walk to work.\n\nWhether our reality is augmented or virtual, it’s clear to see that technology is ushering in a completely new way to participate in, and enjoy, video games.\n\nMobile Gaming\n\nMobile gaming makes up about 45 percent of the total market share of the gaming industry with over half of the worldwide population projected to play a mobile game by 2027.\n\nWhy is mobile gaming so popular? It’s easily accessible and has games for every type of gamer. Instead of having to strap on a headset or pop a disc into a console, mobile gaming allows us to play wherever we go and whenever we want. In 2020, it took over television as the preferred choice of leisure activity with people spending more than 6.5 hours per week on mobile games.\n\nThe mobile gaming industry is poised for continual growth as investments in mobile gaming startups have skyrocketed, and creativity opens up avenues for more gamers to enjoy different types of exciting games.\n\nMore On GamingWhat Does the Future of Gaming Look Like?\n\nPopular Gaming Jobs\n\nTypes of Gaming Jobs\n\nVideo game designer\n\nVideo game programmer\n\nVideo game animator\n\nVideo game quality assurance (QA) tester\n\nVideo Game Designer\n\nThat incredibly intricate, expansive and beautifully designed game you’re playing didn’t just appear out of thin air. It took a team of extraordinarily talented video game designers months, even years, to create all the dimensions that a user encounters when playing a game. These designers go through several prototypes of the game before rendering the final, customer-facing version. This requires an ability to be focused and resilient, as well as, an extensive background knowledge of game design techniques, tools and skills.\n\nGame design, especially at the highest level, usually requires a bachelor’s or master’s degree with a vast knowledge in everything from 3D animation to graphic design and even physics. The job outlook for game design looks really steady because of the enormous rise in console, PC and mobile gaming. Cities like Los angeles, New York and Chicago employ the most designers, and a video game designer can make an average of $42,900 a year.\n\nMore On Game Design18 Video Game Design Courses to Know\n\nVideo Game Programmer\n\nVideo game programmers are some of the most sought-after individuals in the gaming industry. They’re the people who bring a designer’s work to life through code. A good video game would be nothing without the hard work of a programmer, who ensures that characters, missions and environments are supposed to interact the way they were intended. Most game programmers usually have at least a bachelor’s degree, but all need a vast competence of C++ (and other languages) in order to thrive.\n\nGaming’s popularity has caused a boom in industry hiring for programmers and it’s not projected to slow down. Job growth isn’t the only positive aspect about being a game programmer. The salary is too.\n\nThe median salary for software developers, which can encompass computer programming and digital design, is more than $109,000 annually. This puts programmers up there with some of the most well-paid positions in the U.S.\n\nVideo Game Animator\n\nYou can’t have a high quality game without video game animators. Game animators combine technology and art to create the interactive images and sequences that help tell the story of the game. Animators work closely with designers and programmers to make sure that a game’s environment interacts in a way that is natural, fun and helps to progress the game. Animators start every project with a basic storyboard, then help bring that story to life through a series of intricate animations. Animators usually have an extensive background in multimedia knowledge, as well as a degree in a field like computer graphics or animation.\n\nThe video game animation field is projected to grow by about 16 percent until 2030, meaning animators can expect to see a healthy salary. On a median salary, animators can expect a value of around $79,000.\n\nVideo Game Testing and Quality Assurance (QA)\n\nGetting paid to play video games might be the ultimate dream job. Luckily, video game testers (better known as video game quality assurance testers) get paid to play, but more importantly, break, video games. Game QA testers push the work of designers, programmers and animators to the limits to ensure that games are free of bugs and allow for gamers to have the freedom to explore in these virtual environments. Testers usually run through what is called matrix testing, where they have to test every permutation and combination of events that could possibly happen in a game to ensure that nothing can break it.\n\nThere are really no essential educational credentials to have when it comes to QA testing video games. However, these testers need to have an eye for details, a tolerance for repetition and an intense passion for the gaming industry. Video game testers are in demand right now (especially in mobile gaming) due to the rapid increase of games being produced. Game and QA testers on average make around $55,000 annually.",
      "# [What Is Recruiting? Definition, Process and Types.](https://builtin.com/recruiting)\nHow Does Recruiting Work?\n\nRecruiting typically follows this process: sourcing, recruiter screen, hiring team assessment and finally, the offer stage.\n\nSourcing\n\nSourcing begins the process of recruiting, and can be classified as either passive or active. Generally, recruiters will utilize both ways of sourcing.\n\nPassive sourcing is when a recruiter sources by posting open positions on the company’s career site and various job sites in order to collect applicants.\n\nActive sourcing is when a recruiter directly reaches out to prospective candidates who closely match job requirements for an open position. Recruiters do this outreach over various online networking platforms and social media, as well as during in-person events.\n\nRecruiter Screen\n\nOnce a recruiter successfully sources a candidate, they’ll follow up with a recruiter screen with the candidate. This initial screening phase allows the recruiter to get a sense of the candidate’s background and skills in order to identify if they should move forward in the process. This also allows the candidate to get more information about the role and the company, as well as ask questions that are important to their decision making.\n\nHiring Team Assessment\n\nCandidates that pass their initial screens will make their way to the hiring team interview phase where there is a greater focus on assessing the candidate’s skills. Depending on the role’s required skills, these assessments can vary and include coding assessments, writing challenges, Q&As and more.\n\nJob Offer\n\nCandidates who are identified to be the best fit for the role based on the hiring team’s needs are extended an offer. In this stage of the process, the recruiter’s goal is to close the candidate and get them to join the team. Recruiters will usually go over the total compensation for the role, including salary, performance bonus, benefits, perks and additional forms of compensation such as stock options.\n\nWhat Are 3 Types of Recruiting?\n\nInternal Recruiting is the act of recruiting by promoting job openings to existing employees as a way to provide career development opportunities and help with employee retention.\n\nTechnical Recruiting focuses on recruiting candidates for technical positions, such as engineering and product roles. Some of these roles may include software engineers, network architects, product managers and QA specialists.\n\nExecutive Recruiting focuses on recruiting candidates to fill executive level positions, such as CFO, CTO, and CEO. Executive recruiters may also work on other senior management roles that may not be at C-level.\n\nWhy Is Recruiting Important?\n\nAs a key part of the HR team, the recruiting function enables the company to compete for and acquire talent that is essential to the success and growth of the organization. An effective recruiting team is able to attract and recruit a diverse pool of candidates for the hiring teams with whom they partner. Being one of the first experiences of the employee life cycle, recruiting is critical to providing an excellent experience for potential employees, while building talent brand awareness for a company.\n\nWhat Is Recruitment 3.0?\n\nRecruitment 3.0 is a blend of strategic employer branding and inbound recruiting designed to capture the attention of passive candidates.\n\nIt combines aspects of traditional recruiting with modern digital and content marketing methodologies to connect with candidates in an organic and meaningful way. It allows recruiters to sidestep traditional recruiting platforms and professional networks and take their message directly to candidates.\n\nSimply put, Recruitment 3.0 reflects two core challenges of modern recruiting:\n\nThe most in-demand candidates aren’t browsing traditional job boards for their next opportunity — Traditional job boards are losing their appeal to top talent, especially those with a tech background. Fewer than 14 percent of software engineers reported using a job board to find their current job.\n\nCandidates are doing more research than ever before applying — If you are lucky enough to capture the attention of an elite candidate, you better hope your online presence tells a good story. Modern candidates use an average of 16 research tools during the job hunt, so there’s no hiding your dirty laundry.\n\nTo address these challenges, recruiters must leverage new platforms and techniques to fulfill their obligations. Enter Recruitment 3.0.\n\nThe Case For Recruitment 3.0\n\nWe’ve covered a few statistics already, but let’s take a deeper dive into the modern recruiting landscape.\n\n76 percent of decision makers believe candidates have grown wary of traditional job boards. Traditional job boards certainly still have their place, but these days they shouldn’t be the core of your recruitment strategy.\n\n88 percent of recruiters believe that informed candidates are preferable to uninformed candidates. This makes sense, but ask yourself this: are you providing candidates with the information they need in order to be informed?\n\n63 percent of recruiters report an inability to find qualified candidates as their primary challenge. Looks like those informed candidates are hard to come by after all.\n\n62 percent of software developers — the most in-demand talent out there — are open to new opportunities, but only 13 percent of them are actively looking. Just one more example of the opportunity that’s out there for recruiters that can find a way to connect with passive candidates.\n\nThe average time to hire is 23.8 days, while the average cost per hire is $4,129. If nothing else can convince management to make recruiting a priority, perhaps the bottom line will.\n\nJob seekers consider recruiters to be the fifth most trusted source of information about career opportunities. Yikes. The average candidate considers your career page to be more trustworthy than a recruiter.\n\n69 percent of candidates would reject an offer from a company with a bad employer brand, even if they were unemployed. For nearly three quarters of the workforce, even the fear of unemployment isn’t enough to overcome a negative employer brand.\n\nThe average candidate will read six reviews about your company before deciding if they’ll apply. Job seekers are getting better and better at doing their research. Will they like what they find out about your company?\n\nRecruiters claim they can’t find qualified candidates, while candidates claim they can’t trust recruiters. Plenty of passive candidates are open to new opportunities, but recruiters can’t find a way to connect with them. Traditional job boards are disdained by most candidates, but recruiters continue to use them because they have no better option.\n\nAnd in the midst of this, candidates have become more savvy than ever. From employer reviews to your employer brand, they have access to vast amounts of information, and they’re using it to their advantage.\n\nWe could go on, but it’s clear that the recruiting industry is ripe for change.",
      "# [What Is Marketing? Basics of Marketing & Types](https://builtin.com/marketing)\nWhat Is Marketing?\n\nMarketing is one of, if not the, most important aspects of a business. What good is selling a life-changing product if customers have never heard of it and don’t know anything about it? That’s where capable marketers come in handy. Marketers help companies identify consumer and industry trends, formulate campaigns and captivate audiences by showing how their products shine over others.\n\nWhat, exactly, is marketing? Simply put, marketing is the activity of getting people aware of and interested in a brand and its products, often by promoting its offerings so that customers perceive them as valuable or desirable.\n\nWhat Do Marketers Do?\n\nMarketing is the process of designing, positioning, promoting and distributing a product or service in such a way that consumers see value in it. The role of marketers is often to increase brand awareness and loyalty, attract new customers and retain existing ones, ultimately driving more sales revenue for their company.\n\nWhether we’re conscious of it or not, marketing is all around us. Billboards along a highway, commercials on TV, advertisements in magazines, brand posts on social media and optimized content on a website are all everyday examples of marketing.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of marketing is Nike’s slogan “Just Do It.” Pairing “Just Do It” with world-class athlete spokespeople has proven to be one of the most effective marketing campaigns of the last 30 years. The phrase resonates with competitive athletes and fosters a sense of pushing yourself to be a better athlete (in your Nike gear, of course).\n\nOne of the reasons why marketing is so heavily emphasized is that it often helps inform other aspects of the business. Product, sales and advertising teams are all affected by the efforts of a marketing team. Marketers are responsible for guiding the decisions of these teams with valuable insights, so they compile data in the form of market research.\n\nMarket research entails gathering information about a business’ key demographics, their affinity toward a company’s current products and what other competitors are doing. A marketing team’s in-depth market research informs product and engineering teams on what to create, sales teams on what to sell and advertising teams on what to communicate.\n\nWhy Is Marketing Important?\n\nMarketing is a core component of business success because it impacts a company’s ability to reach customers, develop a brand and generate revenue.\n\nBenefits of Marketing\n\nEstablish a customer base\n\nDevelop a trustworthy brand\n\nAdd value to company products\n\nGenerate higher sales profits\n\nMarketing serves as a lifeline that connects brands to potential customers. Market research enables teams to determine who their target audience is and tailor their messaging and communications accordingly. Businesses can then generate positive perception within consumers who are most likely to find value in and buy their products.\n\nOver time, a well-planned marketing strategy solidifies a company’s brand and messaging. This is crucial because consistent branding tells consumers what to expect from a company and leads to a reputation. If a business can continue to meet these expectations and live up to its reputation, it can create trust among loyal customers and add value to its brand in the eyes of consumers.\n\nThe ultimate reward for these efforts is higher sales, and some of the most effective brands have become synonymous with winning and success. For example, many customers will pay more for a Nike shoe than an anonymous brand’s shoe based on the reputation of the Nike brand alone. An ideal brand highlights what makes a company unique, setting it apart from competitors and transforming its products into coveted items among consumers.\n\nThe 4 Ps of Marketing\n\nThe 4 Ps of marketing is a popular framework for understanding the areas involved in marketing strategy. Sometimes known as the marketing mix, the four Ps of marketing — product, price, place and promotion — are vital to every good marketing campaign.\n\n1. Product\n\nProduct is the good or service that the company is offering. Quality products should be able to satisfy customer needs, while also being able to satisfy customer demand. To effectively market a product, marketers need to pinpoint the value it brings to the customer and why customers would want it. The marketing team can start working on campaigns once these, and many other, questions are answered.\n\n2. Price\n\nPrice is obviously a large factor into whether a consumer buys your product or goes to a competitor. Good marketing teams rely on industry research to appropriately price their products so they boost their market share and reach more happy customers.\n\n3. Place\n\nIt’s critical that marketing professionals take place — both digital and physical — into account when marketing a product. Is a certain product more marketable in-store or online? Should you sell a certain product internationally? How do you market to certain geographical locations? How much does a location’s culture affect your marketing abilities? Marketing teams need to be hyper-aware of where they’re marketing to truly optimize their efforts.\n\n4. Promotion\n\nWhat good is a marketing effort if there isn’t some excitement and build-up around a product? Promotion includes the advertising, promotional strategy and public relations surrounding a product. “Should we create a commercial?” “Should we sponsor a podcast?” “Should we just run a Google Adwords campaign?” With some help from market research, marketing executives should be able to know when to target their audience and through which medium. Executing the promotion step of the marketing mix is vital because it helps to build fervor for a product and brand awareness.\n\nTypes of Marketing\n\nMarketing isn’t just a one-size-fits-all effort. There are different types of marketing campaigns depending on where an organization’s customers spend their time and how they prefer to be reached. Below are eight popular types of marketing:\n\nTypes of Digital Marketing\n\nSocial Media Marketing\n\nSocial media marketing involves the use of social media channels (like Instagram, Twitter and YouTube) to build a brand, connect with customers, drive website traffic and increase sales. These platforms have proven to be excellent marketing tools because they have the ability to educate customers on products, individualize consumer social media experiences and engage with an audience in a way that wasn’t possible before. Marketers rely on data analytics tools to develop targeted ads and timely posts that increase social media engagement with brands and boost revenue.\n\nContent Marketing\n\nContent marketing focuses on creating relevant, interesting and valuable content that attracts an audience and converts them into customers. Marketers are turning to this form of content because it boosts SEO traffic and increases both the quantity and quality of customers. A clever content marketing example is Coca Cola’s “Share a Coke” campaign. The company labeled its iconic bottles and cans with popular names to build stronger bonds with customers. The experiment was such a resounding success in Australia that it ended up being implemented in 80 countries worldwide.\n\nInfluencer Marketing\n\nInfluencer marketing is a type of social media marketing that relies on the virality and popularity of social media influencers, who are paid to promote and endorse products. Essentially, companies pay social media accounts with a large following to include their product in an Instagram, Snapchat or even Facebook post. Influencer marketing has proven profitable for both the company and the influencer. The company potentially gets millions of views of their product and the influencer gets paid. For example, to reach Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s 340 million Instagram followers, companies need to pay about $1 million per post.\n\nSEO Marketing\n\nHave you ever wondered how a search engine picks its search results for your specific query? How does it know what to choose at the top option? Much of that has to do with search engine optimization (SEO). SEO is the practice of increasing unpaid (known as organic) traffic through a variety of technical and content-related practices that make it easier for a search engine to read, understand and rank a site. Optimizing a site’s content, photos or backend procedures provides an uncluttered and efficient experience for both a user and a search engine, resulting in higher rankings. The higher rankings provided by this free method of marketing boosts traffic and converts a casual audience into loyal customers.\n\nTypes of Traditional Marketing\n\nPrint Marketing\n\nPrint marketing involves marketers reaching out to target audiences through offline formats. Brochures, informative flyers and mail advertisements are a few examples of print marketing that marketers hand out or deliver to the homes of consumers. Businesses may also try to reach wider audiences by placing ads in magazines, newspapers and other publications. While marketing teams focus on producing concise written content, they must also determine how to pair text with visuals. The most effective print marketing materials complement engaging writing with relevant images, branded color schemes and other eye-catching elements.\n\nBillboard Marketing\n\nBillboard marketing is another way to expose more consumers to a brand and features content on larger physical surfaces. Consumers can find these kinds of advertisements in crowded areas like Times Square, along popular highways or on the walls of buildings. Some companies may pay for mobile billboards, placing ads on the sides of trucks or public transportation vehicles. All billboards follow the same principles of print marketing, combining written content with coordinated color schemes, images and other visuals. Marketing teams need to get creative with billboards, such as applying bold colors or humorous content, since drivers and passersby may only have a few moments to take in a message.\n\nEvent Marketing\n\nEvent marketing relies on both company-sponsored and public events where a business can have conversations with customers and spread its brand through physical materials. Examples of company-sponsored events include hosting a conference or learning convention. Organizations may also join public events, such as setting up a booth at a local community arts fest. Companies should supply marketing teams with materials like tents, banners and flyers for interested individuals. If possible, it’s also helpful to have a sample of a product for consumers to view. Each event provides an opportunity for marketers to share information with consumers and answer any questions, spreading their company’s brand and earning new customers.\n\nProduct Marketing\n\nProduct marketing is vital to the success of a new product launch and is applicable across many industries. Even before the product is built, these marketers are doing intense market research to ensure that the product is the right fit for a company’s customers and that it serves a useful purpose. Then, the product team will use the product marketer’s insights as a guide on what to include in the new product. As the product is being built, the marketer will arm the sales team with the necessary knowledge and materials that will help them sell the product to current customers and reach out to new audiences. After a launch, the product marketer will ensure that customers aren’t having adoption issues and will craft marketing materials to make sure that the product stays relevant as time goes on.\n\nHow to Get Into Marketing\n\nMarketing is a unique field, filled with people who are analytical, yet have an in-depth understanding of human psychology and storytelling. Companies all over the world need competent marketers as more and more products are developed. Who best to evangelize a product other than the people who have the most knowledge about the industry? If you think that mixing analytics with storytelling sounds intriguing, then a career path in marketing might be for you.\n\nThis is the perfect time to get into a marketing role. It’s expected that the advertising and marketing industry will eclipse $786 billion by 2026. Digital marketing has taken on a larger role, with click-and-display ads becoming popular tools for marketers.\n\nMarketing Education Requirements\n\nMost marketing jobs require at least a bachelor’s degree in marketing, journalism, graphic design or a similar major. This shows hiring managers that you have a firm marketing background right away. Of course, having a degree isn’t the only way to break into the industry. There are plenty of reputable courses and bootcamps that can help you become a quality job candidate (or to learn more if you’re already in the industry).\n\nMarketing Career Path\n\nThere are a few career paths that can be taken. In a more traditional marketing sense, newcomers normally start out as marketing coordinators and then work their way up to marketing manager, marketing director and then CMO.\n\nDigital marketers have more options when it comes to roles and paths to take. These marketers usually start out as coordinators and can then experience roles like marketing specialist, search engine marketing manager, social media manager, or marketing director on their way to a CMO or VP of Marketing role. New job titles and responsibilities have been constantly popping up over the last few years due to the advent of new, groundbreaking technologies in the marketing field.\n\nMarketing Career Paths\n\nThere are many important roles that make up a marketing team because of the sector’s importance to the overall goals of a company.

      "# [What Is Consumer Technology? A Guide](https://builtin.com/consumer-tech)\nA Brief History of Consumer Tech\n\nConsumer technology is the umbrella term for any type of technology created with the general public’s use in mind. Think TVs, toaster ovens, smartphones and fitness apps.\n\nConsumer tech can be traced back to the 19th century, when early tech pioneers like David Edward Hughes, Heinrich Rudolph Hertz, Nikola Tesla and Jagadish Edward Bose manipulated electricity for widespread use throughout the world. Indeed, much of the consumer tech we still interact with daily was invented during this period of innovation set between the end of the 19th century and the mid-20th century, including computers (first developed between 1940-45), transistor radios (introduced in 1954) and the microwave oven (1946).\n\nTechnology has continued to develop over time, improving and creating products that are thousands of times more capable than predecessors while enabling form factors to shrink and prices to decrease — creating a technological revolution with the power to reshape our world. Computers, for instance, were once an exclusive product and would require an entire room to store just a few megabytes. Today, powerful computers exist in the pockets of 85 percent of Americans in the form of smartphones, capable of housing hundreds of gigabytes of data with unlimited amounts of cloud space available at all times.\n\nIn another few decades, the advances in consumer tech might be unfathomable to us today.\n\nConsumer Tech Companies\n\nAlphabet (Google)\n\nApple\n\nIntel\n\nSamsung\n\nSony\n\nTesla\n\nWhirlpool\n\nYamaha\n\nConsumer Tech Vs. High Tech\n\nWhile consumer tech typically refers to general-audience-oriented technology like lightbulbs, calculators, cell phones or televisions, high-tech products are slightly different. High tech, or advanced technology, can be thought of as the most cutting-edge forms of technology available, and sometimes refers to the newest type of technology on the market.\n\nOne example of high technology is autonomous mobile robotsthat help package goods. High-tech products such as autonomous vehicles can be used by the general public but are less common than consumer technology products like a microwave or bluetooth sound system.\n\nRead NextBye, Middleman: These Are the Trends Shaping E-Commerce Right Now\n\nTechnology has evolved to better meet and fulfill the needs of people, and as a result, people are now constantly interacting with consumer technology products. Several categories and subcategories of customer technology exist, with plenty of overlap.\n\nTypes of Consumer Technology\n\nAppliances\n\nSmart devices\n\nFitness wearables\n\nSelf-driving cars\n\nVideo game consoles and devices\n\nDrones\n\nComputer software\n\nAs more products are introduced at conferences like the Consumer Electronics Show, these categories will inevitably expand. There are hundreds of categories that could be listed here and products will continue to hit the market as technology evolves. Some of today’s most notable consumer tech categories include:\n\n5G Devices\n\nDevices connected to 5G networks — or 4G, LTE or any other form of cellular network — are able to receive network signals from cellular towers and provide users with online connectivity. Many of the most common forms of consumer electronics fall into this category, including smartphones, tablets and portable hotspots.\n\nIoT Devices\n\nInternet of Things, or IoT, devices connect to specific applications via the internet or other forms of wireless networks for unparalleled user visibility and control. Some common consumer tech products in the IoT devices category included smart home appliances, such as app-controlled thermostats, locks and lights, sensor-based products like doorbells with cameras set to alert users to movement, and various Bluetooth devices.\n\nComputers\n\nIn recent years, computers’ capabilities have increased while their costs have decreased. And everyday people use them for all sorts of reasons — work, gaming, video streaming, internet browsing and more. Laptops, desktops, tablets, gaming computers, video game consoles, smartphones, hard drives and several other types of devices fall into this consumer tech category.\n\nSelf-Driving and Electric Vehicle Consumer Tech\n\nSince their emergence in the early 20th century, cars and motor vehicles of all kinds have grown to become one of the most critical forms of consumer tech to most societies around the world. As technology has improved, so have cars, with vehicles now commonly possessing high-tech features such as built-in GPS, self-driving capabilities, automatic braking, lane sensors, rearview cameras, power steering, and a bevy of additional online and offline capabilities that enhance both safety and comfort. Electric vehicles have eliminated the need for wasteful natural gas resources and self-driving cars are on the rise.\n\nTelevisions and Smart Screens\n\nTelevision became a cultural phenomenon in the mid-20th century and its status has since become cemented as a focal point of modern society. The average American adult watches three hours of television per day, as of 2022. TV and smart screens have been bolstered by the many advancements that the near-century old medium has undergone. Today’s top-end “smart TVs” come loaded with WiFi/5G capabilities, built-in applications, internet search capabilities, built-in gaming features, computer monitoring and more.\n\nSmart Speakers\n\nLeading consumer tech companies like Amazon and Google have introduced a variety of home speakers with built-in virtual assistant technology. These speakers possess internet connectivity and can play music, look up information, place orders and complete a variety of additional tasks by linking to existing accounts. Three of the most popular smart speakers are the Amazon Echo, Apple HomePod and Google Home.\n\nAppliances\n\nHome appliances are a form of consumer tech products that allow people to live easier, more fulfilling lives. From microwave ovens and various kitchen appliances to laundry machines, space heaters and more, appliances of some kind can be found in a majority of homes worldwide.\n\nFitness and Wearables\n\nFitness and consumer tech have merged in seamless fashion, with people embracing devices that track their daily fitness goals and keep them engaged in their activities and workouts. Wearables expand beyond fitness, however, with devices and technology hitting the market that filter air, keep users temperate, alert the proper parties when in danger or in need of help, and much more. Wearable consumer tech includes smartwatches, fitness trackers, heart rate monitors, 911-alerting devices and tech-enabled clothing.\n\nGaming\n\nThe video gaming industry has exploded since its rise through the late 1970s and the 1980s. Today’s systems possess the processing capabilities that would have been unfathomable to game designers back in those days, such as 5K graphics, online gameplay and lightning-fast processor speeds. Video gaming consoles, games, software, VR devices, gaming computers, handheld consoles, add-ons, and accessories are all included in this category.\n\nDrones and Robotics\n\nDrones have been in military use since the 20th century, with commercial and consumer drones hitting the market in the early 21st century. Consumer drones have the ability to take photos, record videos and deliver packages at previously unreachable heights and distances, produced in a variety of form factors and with many accessories for customizing personal drone experiences.\n\nAudio and Music Consumer Tech\n\nSome consumers, whether audiophiles or musicians, take sound very seriously. This category is meant to address that, creating technologically advanced solutions that help them dial in the perfect sound response to their ears, in real time. Multi-room sound systems, Bluetooth speakers, amplifiers, interfaces, microphones, instruments and software all fall into this category of consumer tech.\n\nPhotography\n\nThe first cameras emerged in the late 19th century, since then, photography equipment has embraced digital and technological advancements to unlock capabilities like faster shutter speeds, faster lens speeds, 5K video capturing, low-light shooting and much more. Photography consumer tech includes camera bodies, lenses, sensors, hard drives, memory cards, flash units and additional accessories.\n\nDelivery Consumer Tech\n\nDelivery apps and food delivery platforms have become an integral part of people’s lives. Delivery services use several facets of technology to bring products right to our doors. This industry could not exist without the right software, mobile technology and vehicles.\n\nSoftware\n\nMuch of the consumer tech that people interact with is not a physical product but software that writes the rules to allow hardware to function. Software is responsible for enabling nearly all forms of consumer tech products to work and interact, from menu screens to full-on computer programs.\n\nRelated ReadingProptech: Everything You Need to Know (With 25 Examples)",
      "# [What Is Cryptanalysis? (Definition, Types, Goals) by Anthony Corbo on 2023-01-03](https://builtin.com/articles/cryptanalysis)\nCryptanalysis is the study and discovery of vulnerabilities within cryptographic algorithms that can be used to decrypt ciphertext without knowledge of the secret key. Several forms of cryptanalysis can be used to attack cryptographic messages, ranging from the interception of messages within unsecured communication channels to the matching of plaintext based on the same algorithm techniques. Cryptanalysis also includes measures taken to stop attackers from decoding cryptographic algorithms.\n\nMore From Built In ExpertsHow to Break Into Cybersecurity\n\nTypes of Cryptanalysis\n\nThere are three generic forms of cryptanalysis: ciphertext-only, known ciphertext/plaintext pairs and chosen plaintext or chosen ciphertext.\n\nIn ciphertext-only cryptanalysis, the attacker has the ciphertext available to them for decoding. In known ciphertext/plaintext pair cryptanalysis, attackers will know some element of the plaintext and will be able to match likely elements of the ciphertext to the known plaintext. For example, a computer session may begin with “LOG IN.”\n\nDeciphering this string of text will also allow the attacker to decrypt plaintext that matches the deciphered ciphertext throughout the message. Chosen plaintext or chosen ciphertext cryptanalysis occurs when the attacker unwittingly causes either the transmitter to encrypt plaintext or the receiver to decrypt ciphertext. This provides the attacker with an abundance of knowledge, possibly even knowledge of the entire message’s contents.\n\nWhat Is the Primary Goal of Cryptanalysis?\n\nCryptanalysis is used to understand the contents of protected or encrypted messages and data in order to gain access to either in-transit or at-rest data. Attackers using cryptanalysis may have several goals for doing so, but the ultimate goal is always some degree of cryptographic decryption through either the ciphertext or plain text.\n\nSome specific goals associated with cryptanalysis include a total break (the locating of the secret key), global deduction (the locating of a functionally equivalent algorithm for encryption and decryption without knowledge of the secret key), information deduction (the acquiring of a portion of information about the plaintext or ciphertext that was not previously known), and the distinguishing of the algorithm (giving the attacker the ability to determine the encryption’s output from a random selection of plaintext).\n\nMore From the Built In Tech DictionaryWhat Is a DDoS Attack?\n\nWhat Does a Cryptanalyst Do?\n\nCryptanalysts can be hired to find security weaknesses, potential data leak causes, discover evidence from encrypted messages and more.\n\nCryptanalysts are often associated with government agencies or law enforcement, hired to ensure agency encryption methods are up to par with the current standards in cybersecurity and engage in the deciphering of encrypted messages. Cryptanalysts do this by purposefully exploiting weaknesses so fixes can be applied. As mentioned, government organizations often employ cryptanalysts to decipher encrypted communications and law enforcement agencies will hire cryptanalysts to decode encrypted messages within evidence or testify as experts on a case.\n\nRegardless of their industry or ethics, cryptanalysts must have a strong understanding of mathematics, ciphers, codes, and encryption systems, with daily responsibilities including analyzing intelligence information, diagnosing weaknesses within cryptographic algorithms, developing new cryptanalysis tools and more.",

      "# [Cyberloafing: What Is It and How To Prevent It by Dawn Kawamoto on 2022-11-28](https://builtin.com/articles/cyberloafing)\nCyberloafing in the workplace is a bad thing, right?\n\nAfter all, this habit of employees engaging in non-work-related internet surfing costs U.S. employers a whopping $85 billion a year, according to a University of Nevada report cited by the BBC.\n\nAnd 36 percent of millennials and Gen Z said they spend two or more hours per workday looking at their phones for personal activities, according to over 1,000 full-time U.S. workers surveyed in the 2018 Workplace Distraction Report by online learning company Udemy.\n\nWhat Is Cyberloafing?\n\nCyberloafing is when employees use their work time to engage in non-work-related internet activities from checking social media and personal email to web browsing and more.\n\nAnd with more people working from home following the pandemic, cyberloafing is only increasing.\n\nThe initial reaction often is to stomp out cyberloafing because of its adverse impact on productivity, but research is emerging that raises questions about its potential benefits (like addressing burnout), too.\n\nMore on Work CultureWhat Does Hybrid Work Culture Look Like?\n\nFree Guide: What Does it Take to Retain a Remote Workforce?\n\nHow to reduce turnover while increasing engagement and inclusion for remote employees.\n\nWhat Is Cyberloafing?\n\nCyberloafing is a term to describe employees who use work time to engage in non-work-related activities on the internet, such as web browsing, using social media, or checking and responding to personal email.\n\nAnd while its definition is relatively simple to describe, the way it can manifest makes it a complex matter. Some workers may turn to cyberloafing to relieve stress on the job and browse the internet as a coping mechanism, according to a study titled “Unraveling Cyberloafing Paradox: Towards a Targeted Approach for Managing Cyberloafing.”\n\nEmployees spending time browsing the internet on their phone, or emailing friends and looking at social media when they are supposed to be working on a report is a blatant example of cyberloafing, Bright Frimpong, a research assistant at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley and co-author of the “Unraveling Cyberloafing Paradox” study, told Built In.\n\nBut there are also a lot of gray areas when it comes to cyberloafing, Frimpong added. For example, he said, if there is a lull in your work while you wait for another team to finish a project to hand over to you, are you really cyberloafing if you use the time to check your personal email, look up sports scores or watch a YouTube video?\n\n“It’s very difficult to pinpoint these as cyberloafing behaviors because even though they are not productive, the employee has really nothing to do at that time,” Frimpong added. “I think it’s just a matter of being productive at the right time.”\n\nThe term was coined in 1995 but grew in popularity in 2002 after a research paper was published in the Organizational Behavior Journal on the topic. Initially, early research focused on the unproductive and harmful effects a company faced when its employees engaged in cyberloafing. But as study into this area matured, researchers began exploring other fringe areas of cyberloafing and the discovery of potential benefits began to emerge, Frimpong said.\n\nFind out who's hiring.\n\nSee all HR jobs at top tech companies & startups\n\nView Jobs\n\nWhat Causes Cyberloafing?\n\nTo understand the causes of cyberloafing, you need to understand what employees are trying to achieve by it. In some instances, there are tangible benefits like learning new skills. In others, the employee might use it for a much-needed break for their mental health or well-being.\n\nFor example, loneliness and workplace ostracism can prompt some employees to turn to social media to offset the lack of interaction with co-workers and others, said Natalie Mason, a PhD candidate at Aston University who is researching the use of cyberloafing as a coping mechanism and authored a report on the topic published in Nature Reviews Psychology.\n\nThese employees may find the emotional support they need to power through the rest of the day via social media, Mason said.\n\nWhat Causes Cyberloafing?\n\nLoneliness and workplace ostracism\n\nStress\n\nBurnout\n\nWorkplace aggression\n\nEmotional or physical pain\n\nBoredom\n\nDesire to find resources that make work and life better\n\nIn other cases, employees are using cyberloafing as a release valve for their stress, whether it’s from feeling burned out or because of workplace aggression from others, Mason said. It can provide a mental distraction that can help employees jump back into work once their cyberloafing break is over.\n\nCyberloafing can also help momentarily offset workplace boredom, allowing employees to take a mental break from their tasks and return refreshed.\n\nEmployees who lack adequate resources at work, such as an ergonomic office chair, may jump on the internet to learn of alternative resources they could use, like browsing for one. That internet activity, however, is considered a form of cyberloafing since it is not directly involved with the task at hand and is considered developing new non-work-related skills or abilities while on the job, Frimpong said.\n\nEmployer policies around allowing workers to bring their own electronic devices, such as smartphones, tablets or even laptops, into the workplace can also contribute to cyberloafing, since employees may feel it’s perfectly fine to use them anytime, despite being on the clock.\n\nMore on Mental HealthHow to Avoid Employee Burnout\n\nHow to Prevent Cyberloafing\n\nTo start, develop clear and equitable cyberloafing HR policies. Set expectations on the amount of time or circumstances where non-work-related internet activities would be allowed either on an employee’s personal device or the company’s equipment. Be sure to clearly note the websites and social media that would be prohibited.\n\nAnd rather than just address an employee’s actual cyberloafing behavior, try digging deeper into the “why” with them.\n\n“Managers need to be more understanding of why someone might go to their phone or use the internet during a time they should be productive at work.”\n\n“There are so many motivations that go into cyberloafing. So, to really understand how to stop it or manage it, you need to know the motivations behind it,” Frimpong said.\n\nIn some cases, for example, employees may lack the self-awareness to know they are using social media at work because they feel ostracized by their teammates, but in other cases, they might be aware of this reason. In either situation, the issue should be discussed with the employee’s manager, Mason said.\n\nWays to Prevent Cyberloafing\n\nSet expectations on when non-work-related internet activities are allowed, and on which devices.\n\nClearly note websites and social media that are prohibited.\n\nIdentify triggers for employees who might be engaging in non-work-related internet activities to reduce emotional or physical issues.\n\nHave open conversations with employees to understand why they may be resorting to cyberloafing.\n\n“Managers need to be more understanding of why someone might go to their phone or use the internet during a time they should be productive at work,” Mason told Built In. “There should be open communication between you and your employees to understand why they are doing these actions.”\n\nFor employees who turn to cyberloafing to improve their well-being or to reduce emotional or physical discomfort, it comes down to identifying the triggers for those behaviors and then addressing them through conversations with the employee in question.\n\nIn cases where cyberloafing is excessive and interfering with meeting deadlines or completing projects, it can be useful to explore the problem through another lens.\n\n“You have to look at cyberloafing as the same way you would diagnose mental illness,” Mason said. “If it gets in the way of your everyday life, then it’s excessive. If it’s stopping you from meeting your deadlines and doing your everyday job, it’s excessive.”",
      "# [Startup Founders & Entrepreneurs: What’s the Difference?](https://builtin.com/founders-entrepreneurship)\nDifferences Between Startup Founders and Entrepreneurship\n\nGenerally speaking, entrepreneurs engage in business to accumulate profits, whether for personal gain, to grow a business, to benefit a non-profit organization or for philanthropic reasons. Entrepreneurs can acquire profits in several different ways, such as creating products, starting or investing in companies, purchasing resources, or facilitating an acquisition.\n\nA founder is someone behind the creation of a startup company that begins with an idea of how to fundamentally improve a product or service, or fill a need within an industry. A startup founder takes the first steps towards turning the idea into a reality, building a company based on the most efficient way to bring a product to the marketplace. Many startups are created with the intention to one day be acquired by a larger company while others are able to leverage their success and become a stable, singular entity.\n\nWhat Is a Founder?\n\nStartup Founder\n\nA startup founder takes the first steps in turning an idea into a business. Startup founders recognize a need for a particular item or service and try to find ways to fill these gaps. Most startups require heavy lifting and tireless hours, especially early in their development, so founders do not generally create startups to acquire wealth. Rather, founders believe that their ideas can change the way people interact with their world and each other in a fundamental way.\n\nCofounders\n\nFrom deciding upon the logistics of how to launch an entirely new idea into a marketplace to the daily needs of running any business, startup founders often work around the clock to make their business a reality. Many startups are able to succeed despite these demands by splitting up the workload among cofounders. Bringing on a cofounder in the early stage of a startup allows a company to become more nimble — one founder may be devoted to researching and developing a product while another may focus only on networking and acquiring funding. In exchange for a percentage of a company, cofounders have the potential to significantly reduce the amount of time required for a product to hit the market.\n\nCEO vs. Founder\n\nAs a startup transitions into a company and products hit the market, the role of CEO must be established. While a founder will often take on the CEO title, that is not always the case. A founder may instead opt into taking a more hands-on position and leave it to a more experienced person to lead their company. A CEO is responsible for overseeing the work of other top-level executives throughout the organization, ensuring the startup remains vigilant in its goals and realistic about expectations.\n\nSuccessful Startup Founders\n\nBrian Chesky & Joe Gebbia – AirBnB\n\nJack Dorsey – Twitter\n\nLeah Busque – TaskRabbit\n\nSteve Jobs – Apple\n\nMasayoshi Son – SoftBank\n\nEmily Weiss – Glossier\n\nWhitney Wolfe Herd – Bumble\n\nLarry Page & Sergey Brin – Google\n\nJeff Bezos – Amazon\n\nWhat Is an Entrepreneur?\n\nTypes of Business Entrepreneurship\n\nThere are many different forms of business entrepreneurship one can pursue, each possessing a variety of benefits and costs of entry. Entrepreneurship requires a great amount of discipline, foresight, and focus, so pursuing the right form is crucial to success. Entrepreneurship can be categorized based on markets and entrepreneurial goals. Here are some of the most common forms of entrepreneurship.\n\nSocial Entrepreneurship\n\nWhat separates social entrepreneurship from others is the end goal — social entrepreneurs don’t seek to make profits or accumulate wealth. Instead, social entrepreneurs build nonprofits and organizations that work toward facilitating societal change.\n\nSmall Business Entrepreneurship\n\nSmall business entrepreneurship is the most common form of entrepreneurship and provides multiple entry points for entrepreneurs to begin exploring and finding a niche. Most entrepreneurs starting small businesses seek to build a sustainable lifestyle for themselves and their families on their own terms, with independence being a primary driving factor. Most small businesses do not seek funding from venture capitalists.\n\nLarge Company Entrepreneurship\n\nAll companies, particularly large companies, must continue a cycle of innovation to maintain relevance amongst their customer base. Entrepreneurs at large companies are focused on the design of new products and services to keep up with market demands. Large companies can also acquire smaller companies to keep their products and services fresh.\n\nStartup Entrepreneurship\n\nStartup entrepreneurs seek funding from venture capitalists to bridge gaps in markets and create products that fulfill a clear need in the world. Startup entrepreneurs work to develop a product and company over time and are dedicated to successfully bringing products to market over maximum profitability.\n\nEntrepreneur vs. Investor\n\nOften, entrepreneurs are owners of their companies or are heavily involved in the operation of the business. Entrepreneurs keep tabs on what a company aspires to achieve and the means necessary to achieve its goals. However, entrepreneurs can also be investors who are independent of companies, offering direct avenues to funding in exchange for a stake in the organization. Investors in large companies are often given a Board of Directors spot to remain up-to-date on a company’s opportunities, threats, and current operational status.\n\nRead Next:23 Mission Statement Examples That Define Companies and Inspire Customers\n\nTraits of Successful Founders\n\nStartups are created to meet a variety of needs and come in several different forms. While every founder has a unique goal they are setting out to accomplish with their business, many have similar characteristics that steer them towards success.\n\nTraits of Founders\n\nVision\n\nPassion\n\nFocus\n\nInstinctual thinking\n\nPersistence\n\nNetworking and entrepreneurial thinking\n\nForesight\n\nSome of the traits that are most necessary to succeed as a startup founder include:\n\n1. Vision\n\nThe first step in every startup’s story is solidifying the idea that will bring a company into the public eye. By ensuring they have a well-rounded perspective on what a company’s growth and path to market looks like, founders can set their startup on a successful path.\n\n2. Passion\n\nFor a startup to succeed, it must produce products or services that fulfill a specific need within a market or industry. Founders must be dedicated and passionate about unlocking a solution to this need while continuing to grow their company and compete in crowded markets.\n\n3. Focus\n\nAlong with the drive to keep refining their product, startup founders must keep a company’s goals in mind with every decision they make. Without focus, startups can get caught up in pursuing ideas that distract them from bringing their big idea to market. Co-founders help each other remain focused on a company’s overall goals through a sense of accountability and checks and balances.\n\n4. Instinctual Thinking\n\nWhile focus and vision are top priorities for any startup founder, the most successful founders know when to follow their instincts and go with their gut. Market changes and new challenges inevitably emerge while laying a company’s groundwork, so startup founders must be able to process information quickly and make swift decisions.\n\n5. Persistence\n\nEvery startup requires a tremendous amount of time to succeed, and along the way, many challenges may threaten a product’s ability to hit the market and a company’s ability to be profitable. Startup founders must be able to see these challenges through and keep a level head to lead teams to success.\n\n6. Networking and Entrepreneurial Thinking\n\nOne commonality among all startups is funding. Founders must be able to seek out and receive funding from investors to truly build a robust organization. This means that attending networking events, getting to know key industry investors, and having a well-thought-out pitch are all crucial parts of growth.\n\n7. Foresight\n\nNo founder can see the future but every founder must be able to analyze data and have strong insights into their industry to keep up with ever-changing consumer needs.\n\nRelated Reading: 3 Questions Every Data-Driven Company Needs to Ask\n\nTraits of Successful Entrepreneurs\n\nMany of the traits required for a startup founder also apply to successful entrepreneurs. Regardless of the type of entrepreneurship one is pursuing, maintaining a sense of instinctual thinking, passion about a market, and foresight into how consumer needs may develop is essential to entrepreneurial success. Additionally, there are a few other traits that benefit any entrepreneur or investor.\n\nTraits of Entrepreneurs\n\nRisk tolerance\n\nFlexibility\n\nCollaboration\n\n1. Risk Tolerance\n\nWhether starting an organization or investing in a startup, the risk of failure always carries a high probability for entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs must ensure they have the security and wherewithal to withstand an investment gone wrong and move on to their next pursuit. No successful entrepreneur will have a perfect investment record.\n\n2. Flexibility\n\nBecoming an entrepreneur means working with a variety of people with a variety of ideas. Entrepreneurship requires the flexibility to acknowledge others’ ideas and find the compromise that works best for a product and company, regardless of personal feelings.\n\n3. Collaboration\n\nIn addition to being able to compromise in business, entrepreneurs need to be able to collaborate with their partners to get the most out of a company. Great products are developed by combining the expertise of multiple stakeholders with insight over a product’s place in the marketplace, so entrepreneurs must come prepared with their best ideas to help a company grow.\n\nThere isn’t one set path to becoming an entrepreneur or founder, rather it is a combination of experiences and skills that lead individuals to create new products, services or business opportunities. Founders and entrepreneurs can range from people with minimal work experience to seasoned professionals. The driving force behind becoming an entrepreneur or a founder are ideas that shake up a market or industry.\n\nOnce founders and entrepreneurs have a business idea, the next steps are to develop and test the product or service, create a business plan, secure funding and then finally launch the business and continuously manage it.\n\nSkills for Startup Founders\n\nSince founders are typically responsible for taking their ideas and turning them into tangible products, they need to have a combination of technical skills and soft skills.\n\nSkills for Startup Founders\n\nComputer and coding skills\n\nData analysis skills\n\nCommunication skills\n\nLeadership skills\n\nComputer and Coding Skills\n\nFounders, especially those in the tech industry, often benefit from having basic computer skills and knowledge of coding and programming languages to successfully build software products. These technical skills allow founders to build their product as well as understand the hiring needs for highly technical roles in the future.\n\nData Analysis Skills\n\nBeing able to conduct data analysis helps founders understand and monitor their market and competitors, test their products and better understand the developments and features their products need.\n\nCommunication Skills\n\nCommunication is crucial for almost every job and founders are no different. The ability to articulate their product or service’s function and importance is essential to getting investors to participate. As your company and team grows, communication between leaders and employees will establish the company’s mission, culture and values.\n\nLeadership Skills\n\nFounders that plan on having a hand in the day-to-day operations of their company need to have strong leadership skills. Founders that become CEOs will be responsible for making strategic business decisions and establishing people management processes and best practices.\n\nSkills for Entrepreneurs\n\nThere are many points of crossover between the skills needed to be a founder vs. an entrepreneur. However, since entrepreneurs are typically driven by a product or company’s profitability, having in depth financial knowledge and networking skills are essential.\n\nSkills for Entrepreneurs\n\nNetworking skills\n\nFinancial analysis skills\n\nBusiness acumen\n\nCommunication skills\n\nNetworking Skills\n\nAs entrepreneurs look for business opportunities, understanding how to network will help them establish a pool of people to lean on as resources. Strong people networks can help entrepreneurs learn of new investment opportunities and up and coming products as well as connect with potential customers or investors for their own business.\n\nFinancial Skills\n\nSince entrepreneurs can be both investors and those seeking investment, having a thorough understanding of financial markets and analysis is crucial. Basic math and accounting skills can go a long way for entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs will also need the financial know-how to understand revenue models, acquisitions costs, overhead cost and gross and net margins.\n\nBusiness Acumen\n\nHaving strong business acumen allows entrepreneurs to take a big-picture view of their investments or help solve operational issues that arise. Developing business acumen means that entrepreneurs should have an understanding of several key areas: how a company earns a profit, the drive behind business decisions, how to create budgets, how to prioritize projects and how to attract and work with investors.\n\nCommunication Skills\n\nSimilar to founders, entrepreneurs need to have strong communication skills to build their network and establish trust with investors.",
      "# [Big Data: What It Is, Why It Matters, How It Works](https://builtin.com/big-data)\nWhat Is Big Data?\n\nBig data refers to large, diverse data sets made up of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data. This data is generated continuously and always growing in size, which makes it too high in volume, complexity and speed to be processed by traditional data management systems. Big data is used across almost every industry to draw insights, perform analytics, train artificial intelligence and machine learning models, as well as help make data-driven business decisions.\n\nWhy Is Big Data Important?\n\nData is generated anytime we open an app, use a search engine or simply travel place to place with our mobile devices. The result? Massive collections of valuable information that companies and organizations manage, store, visualize and analyze.\n\nTraditional data tools aren’t equipped to handle this kind of complexity and volume, which has led to a slew of specialized big data software platforms designed to manage the load.\n\nThough the large-scale nature of big data can be overwhelming, this amount of data provides a heap of information for organizations to use to their advantage. Big data sets can be mined to deduce patterns about their original sources, creating insights for improving business efficiency or predicting future business outcomes.\n\nAs a result, big data analytics is used in nearly every industry to identify patterns and trends, answer questions, gain insights into customers and tackle complex problems. Companies and organizations use the information for a multitude of reasons like automating processes, optimizing costs, understanding customer behavior, making forecasts and targeting key audiences for advertising.\n\nThe 3 V’s of Big Data\n\nBig data is commonly characterized by three V’s:\n\nVolume\n\nVolume refers to the huge amount of data that’s generated and stored. While traditional data is measured in familiar sizes like megabytes, gigabytes and terabytes, big data is stored in petabytes and zettabytes.\n\nVariety\n\nVariety refers to the different types of data being collected from various sources, including text, video, images and audio. Most data is unstructured, meaning it’s unorganized and difficult for conventional data tools to analyze. Everything from emails and videos to scientific and meteorological data can constitute a big data stream, each with their own unique attributes.\n\nVelocity\n\nBig data is generated, processed and analyzed at high speeds. Companies and organizations must have the capabilities to harness this data and generate insights from it in real-time, otherwise it’s not very useful. Real-time processing allows decision makers to act quickly.\n\nHow Big Data Works\n\nBig data is produced from multiple data sources like mobile apps, social media, emails, transactions or Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, resulting in a continuous stream of varied digital material. The diversity and constant growth of big data makes it inherently difficult to extract tangible value from it in its raw state. This results in the need to use specialized big data tools and systems, which help collect, store and ultimately translate this data into usable information. These systems make big data work by applying three main actions — integration, management and analysis.\n\n1. Integration\n\nBig data first needs to be gathered from its various sources. This can be done in the form of web scraping or by accessing databases, data warehouses, APIs and other data logs. Once collected, this data can be ingested into a big data pipeline architecture, where it is prepared for processing.\n\nBig data is often raw upon collection, meaning it is in its original, unprocessed state. Processing big data involves cleaning, transforming and aggregating this raw data to prepare it for storage and analysis.\n\n2. Management\n\nOnce processed, big data is stored and managed within the cloud or on-premises storage servers (or both). In general, big data typically requires NoSQL databases that can store the data in a scalable way, and that doesn’t require strict adherence to a particular model. This provides the flexibility needed to cohesively analyze disparate sources of data and gain a holistic view of what is happening, how to act and when to act on data.\n\n3. Analysis\n\nAnalysis is one the final steps of the big data lifecycle, where the data is explored and analyzed to find applicable insights, trends and patterns. This is frequently carried out using big data analytics tools and software. Once useful information is found, it can be applied to make business decisions and communicated to stakeholders in the form of data visualizations.\n\nUses of Big Data\n\nHere are a few examples of industries where the big data revolution is already underway:\n\nFinance\n\nFinance and insurance industries utilize big data and predictive analytics for fraud detection, risk assessments, credit rankings, brokerage services and blockchain technology, among other uses. Financial institutions also use big data to enhance their cybersecurity efforts and personalize financial decisions for customers.\n\nHealthcare\n\nHospitals, researchers and pharmaceutical companies adopt big data solutions to improve and advance healthcare. With access to vast amounts of patient and population data, healthcare is enhancing treatments, performing more effective research on diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s, developing new drugs, and gaining critical insights on patterns within population health.\n\nEducation\n\nUsing big data in education allows educational institutions and professionals to better understand student patterns and create relevant educational programs. This can help in personalizing lesson plans, predicting learning outcomes and tracking school resources to reduce operational costs.\n\nRetail\n\nRetail utilizes big data by collecting large amounts of customer data through purchase and transaction histories. Information from this data is used to predict future consumer behavior and personalize the shopping experience.\n\nGovernment\n\nBig data in government can work to gather insights on citizens from public financial, health and demographic data and adjust government actions accordingly. Certain legislation, financial procedures or crisis response plans can be enacted based on these big data insights.\n\nMarketing\n\nBig data in marketing helps provide an overview of user and consumer behavior for businesses. Data gathered from these parties can reveal insights on market trends or buyer behavior, which can be used to direct marketing campaigns and optimize marketing strategies.\n\nMedia\n\nIf you’ve ever used Netflix, Hulu or any other streaming services that provide recommendations, you’ve witnessed big data at work. Media companies analyze our reading, viewing and listening habits to build individualized experiences. Netflix even uses data on graphics, titles and colors to make decisions about customer preferences.\n\nBig Data Challenges\n\n1. Volume and Complexity of Data\n\nBig data is massive, complicated and ever growing. This makes it difficult in nature to capture, organize and understand, especially as time goes on. In order to manage big data, new technologies have to be developed indefinitely and organizational big data strategies have to continually adapt.\n\n2. Integration and Processing Requirements\n\nAside from storage challenges, big data also has to be properly processed, cleaned and formatted to make it useful for analysis. This can take a considerable amount of time and effort due to big data’s size, multiple data sources and combinations of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data. Processing efforts and identifying what information is useful can also be compounded in the case of excess noisy data or data corruption.\n\n3. Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks\n\nBig data systems can sometimes handle sensitive or personal user information, making them vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks or privacy breaches. As more personal data resides in big data storage, and at such massive scales, this raises the difficulty and costs of safeguarding this data from criminals. Additionally, how businesses collect personal data through big data systems may not comply with regional data collection laws or regulations, leading to a breach of privacy for affected users.\n\nBig Data Technologies\n\nBig data technologies describe the tools used to handle and manage data at enormous scales. These technologies include those used for big data analytics, collection, mining, storage and visualization.\n\nData Analysis Tools\n\nData analysis tools involve software that can be used for big data analytics, where relevant insights, correlations and patterns are identified within given data.\n\nBig Data Tools\n\nBig data tools refer to any data platform, database, business intelligence tool or application where large data sets are stored, processed or analyzed.\n\nData Visualization Tools\n\nData visualization tools help to display the findings extracted from big data analytics in the form of charts, graphs or dashboards.",

      "# [Nanorobotics: Theory, Applications, How Does It Work? by Artem Oppermann on 2023-03-03](https://builtin.com/robotics/nanorobotics)\nNanorobotics refers to the emerging field of science and technology that deals with the design, development and control of robots at the nanoscale.\n\nThe nanoscale includes the size range of 1 to 100 nanometers, where one nanometer (nm) is equal to one billionth of a meter.\n\nSince nanorobots are robots built to operate at the nanoscale, they could perform tasks that are beyond the capabilities of conventional macro-scale robots. Nanorobots would have unique properties and capabilities that allow them to control and manipulate materials at the nanoscale, which would make them highly valuable for a wide range of applications and industries.\n\nUsing nanorobots can also lead to cost savings and improved efficiency. For example, in healthcare, nanorobots could be used for targeted drug delivery, which can reduce the amount of medication a patient needs and minimize side effects, thereby resulting in cost savings for patients and healthcare providers. Nanorobots could also be used for non-invasive surgeries to reduce the need for lengthy hospital stays and recovery times. It’s clear the field of nanorobotics has the potential to bring significant, positive changes and benefit society in numerous ways.\n\nRelated Reading From This ExpertWhat Is Nanotechnology?\n\nHow Do Nanorobotics Work?\n\nNanorobotics work by using robots at nanoscale, which are also known as nanorobots. The design and operation of nanorobots can vary depending on their intended use. In general, nanorobots would work by using various technologies like nanoscale sensors, control systems and nanoscale actuators.\n\nThe sensors in nanorobots could detect specific signals or conditions like the presence of a certain type of molecule or material, and then transmit this information to the control system. The control system could then use this information to decide on the proper action for the nanorobot. We could use the nanorobots’ actuators to perform a wide range of actions including movement, releasing of drugs in the human body or the manipulation of structures and materials (more on this below).\n\nIn order to perform their intended tasks, nanorobots need to be able to navigate and interact with their environment. This can be accomplished by a variety of methods like self-propulsion, remote control, or through chemical or biological means.\n\nWhat Are the Challenges of Nanorobotics?\n\nThe development and implementation of nanorobotics faces several challenges, including:\n\nTechnical Complexity: Designing and operating nanorobots is a complicated process that involves many technical difficulties like development of nanoscale components, controlling the movement of the nanorobots and ensuring their stability.\n\nSafety Concerns: The potential for nanorobots in medical applications and the environment raises concerns about their safety. For example, nanorobots, designed for medical treatments, could harm patients in the case of a malfunction.\n\nRegulatory Issues: There are currently few regulations in place to govern the development and use of nanorobots, which may slow their widespread adoption by public and private sector entities.\n\nFunding and Resources: The development of nanorobotics is quite expensive and requires significant funding and resources, as well as specialized equipment and human expertise.\n\nScalability: The development and production of large numbers of nanorobots can be challenging due to the complex and time-consuming nature of the manufacturing process.\n\nFind out who's hiring.\n\nSee all Developer + Engineer jobs at top tech companies & startups\n\nView 10000+ Jobs\n\nAre Nanorobotics Dangerous?\n\nIf not properly designed and controlled, nanobots could cause harm to a living organism or the environment. Let’s say, hypothetically, that nanobots are designed and programmed to target and remove a specific type of cellular debris in a human body. Instead, the nanobots could end up attacking healthy cells or tissues, which will cause harm to the patient. This situation could occur if the nanobots cannot properly distinguish between the targeted debris and healthy cells, or in the case of the nanobots malfunction. Another risk would involve the potential for the harmful use of nanorobots. For example, nanorobots could be used as weapons or for industrial espionage.\n\nDue to these mentioned challenges, the development of nanorobotics has been slow so far and commercial use seems far away. However, we’ve seen progress and it’s likely that these challenges will be overcome in the coming decades.\n\nMore in Nanotechnology10 Nanotechnology Examples Making a Big Impact\n\nApplications of Nanorobotics\n\nThe field of nanorobotics has a wide range of potential applications across various industries. It’s important to note that many of these applications are still theoretical.",

      "# [Microrobotics: Tiny Robots and Their Many Uses by Jacob Biba on 2022-09-07](https://builtin.com/robotics/microrobotics)\nThis journey began in the stomach of a mouse.\n\nMore than seven years ago, a team of researchers led by Joseph Wang, a professor of nanoengineering at the University of California San Diego, deployed a small, zinc-based robotic motor inside a mouse’s stomach. The motor — which measured less than the width of a human hair and was propelled by the mouse’s own gastric acid — delivered a payload of gold nanoparticles before self-destructing.\n\nIt’s believed to be the first in vivo use of a micromotor inside a living creature, Wang told Built In, drawing comparisons to Fantastic Voyage, a science-fiction film released more than half a century ago. In the film, a nuclear submarine and its human crew are shrunk down and sent on a life-saving mission — inside a human.\n\nFollowing the success of Wang’s experiment, more gastric acid-fueled and treatment-focused voyages inside mice and larger animals, like pigs, have commenced, paving the way for potential human trials. It’s possible, in the future, a wave of targeted treatment and therapeutic applications for the biotech industry will be developed, all likely starting with a simple swallow of an encapsulated microrobot.\n\n“You’ll take your pill,” Wang said. “But the robot will do the job.”\n\nMore on RoboticsXenobots: The Self-Replicating Living Robots\n\nWhat Is Microrobotics?\n\nMicrorobotics is basically an all-encompassing term covering the development of small robots. Microrobots typically measure less than 1 millimeter, though sizing can vary based on researcher and use case.\n\nToday, microrobots are mainly used in the biotech industry, aiding in the development of diagnostic and targeted therapeutic tools to monitor and treat disease. They’ve also been developed to aid in environmental monitoring and remediation, search and rescue, engine inspection, and for agricultural research.\n\nResearchers are currently exploring how these tiny robots could potentially respond to chemicals or other biological signals they may encounter in the human body, as well as work together and communicate with one another in swarms during environmental remediation applications.\n\nMore on Medical Robotics11 Medical and Surgical Robots Transforming the Healthcare Industry\n\nMicrorobotics in Biotech\n\nAdvances in robotics are typically spurred by the innate desire to eliminate those mundane chores, like vacuuming, we no longer want to do. But with microrobotics, it’s different. The jobs these robots are designed for could save our lives.\n\n“If you look at the main motivation of tiny robots, even from the beginning, it’s always been medical,” Metin Sitti, director of the Physical Intelligence Department at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart, Germany, told Built In. It’s where the greatest scientific and societal impact can be made, he said, the dream being that one day robots would be miniaturized and put inside the human body to monitor and treat disease.\n\n“If you look at the main motivation of tiny robots, even from the beginning, it’s always been medical.”\n\nSitti’s first project inspired by this dream was a soft robotic capsule targeting the GI tract. To create it, Sitti and his team turned existing capsule camera technology being used commercially in healthcare into a small robot that could potentially deliver drugs and perform biopsies and other treatments.\n\n“We started with pill-size robots that could be put inside the body,” Sitti said. “And then we miniaturized [them] down to microscale.”\n\nOver the last 10 years, Sitti and his team in Germany have developed untethered microrobots measuring as large as the diameter of a catheter down to cell size for applications targeting certain diseases where limited access poses a high risk, like pancreatic and brain cancers, cardiac diseases, blood clots, strokes and aneurysms.\n\n“We are trying to identify such critical diseases where wireless microrobots can make a big difference,” Sitti said.\n\nMore on RoboticsWhat Are Shape-Shifting Robots?\n\nMicrorobotics Outside the Human Body\n\nOf course, developments in the field are poised to have an impact outside the human body, too.\n\nSearch and Rescue Operations\n\nImagine being buried under rubble, or trapped in some other confined space after a natural disaster when suddenly, from the nookiest of crannies, a tiny, cockroach-like robot comes to your rescue. While it won’t physically pull you out from wreckage, this bio-inspired microrobot would work in concert with search and rescue teams, potentially providing communication capabilities while relaying location and other vital information that could aid in your rescue.\n\nDeveloped by researchers at Harvard University’s Wyss Institute, the Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot, known as HAMR, has more than 60 joints and can move at four body lengths per second. New developments like electroadhesive foot pads and origami-based ankle joints in HAMR-E, a more recent iteration of the microrobot, allow it to traverse more challenging surfaces that are curved or inverted, giving them the potential to work in those hard-to-reach places and navigate confines like jet engines for safety inspections.\n\nPlant Pollination\n\nNoah Jafferis, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, is also working on a bio-inspired microrobot — a robotic bee capable of shaking pollen from flowering plants with “high frequency” vibrations emanating from the device’s “artificial muscles.”\n\nThe microrobot’s vibrating muscles would enable researchers to mimic the vibration of a buzz-pollinating bee, Jafferis told Built in, and ultimately help them learn more about the buzz pollination process.\n\nJafferis and research partner Mario Vallejo-Marin, an associate professor of biological and environmental sciences at the University of Stirling in Scotland, were awarded an $840,000 grant from the Human Frontier Science Program, a French non-profit that funds collaborative life science research, to support their project over the next three years. “Potential benefits of our research, down the line, include understanding better what kind of bee vibrations are best to pollinate different types of flowers, including perhaps even crop species like tomato,” Vallejo-Marin told the Boston Globe in April.\n\nBiodefense and Environmental Remediation\n\nTiny robots also prove useful when it comes to biodefense and environmental remediation. According to Wang, special receptors can be added to microrobots which can then be released to capture, transport, isolate or destroy nerve agents, other biological weapons like Ricin and Anthrax and even viruses.\n\nIn response to the pandemic, Wang worked on a microrobotic model based on algae capable of removing the COVID-19 virus from wastewater. Like other environmental remediation tools, this bio-inspired microrobot, which is paired with an antibody of the virus’ spike protein, works as a swimming sponge to detoxify its surrounding environment.\n\nBut there’s only so much a single microrobot can do when it comes to remediation. That’s why researchers like Sitti believe swarms of microrobots, with onboard sensing capabilities, will one day be deployed to monitor sensitive environments, quickly detecting toxic and other dangerous chemicals if some sort of spill or accident were to occur.\n\n“I think rather than these passive techniques that we typically use right now with some chemicals, we’d like to change it with active microrobotic collectors or swarms doing that, which will be much smarter, effective and faster,” Sitti said. “As an autonomous system, if we can build and leave them in the environment, they can do this continuously without human intervention.”\n\nMore on Robotic Innovation35 Robotics Companies on the Forefront of Innovation\n\nThe Future of Microrobotics\n\nLike Wang and Sitti, Jinxing Li, an assistant professor in the department of bioengineering and the Institute for Qualitative Health Science and Engineering at Michigan State University, is also working to unlock the health benefits of microrobotics. Li is especially focused on the targeted therapeutic potential of microrobotics, like tiny robots that could enter the human body to detect and kill cancer cells with thermal ablation, or extreme heat.\n\nAnd for Wang, his team’s in vivo microrobotic motor experiments are an exciting step toward detecting, treating and managing diseases like diabetes. One day he envisions humans taking a daily multi-segment microrobotic pill — one with multiple targets that releases drugs sequentially all at the appropriate time.\n\nBut for this to be realized, a number of barriers will have to be overcome.\n\n“Are they powerful enough to move in your body, and if so, how am I going to see them?”\n\nIn the last 10 years, questions around how to power microrobots have been solved: They’re typically powered either with magnets, acoustic or light, or self-propelled through chemical reaction, like Wang’s micromotor. But Li told Built In it gets more complicated as you look to the future.\n\n“Are they powerful enough to move in your body, and if so, how am I going to see them?,” he said. “I think imaging and navigation are going to be the next challenges for medical applications.”\n\nThen regulators, doctors and the general public have to see, and believe, that these devices can operate safely. There’s also a psychological barrier to overcome, according to Sitti, like the belief, promoted by books and films, that these devices could prove dangerous. “In that sense, we need to educate the public on the positive uses of these tiny devices for medical and other environmental applications,” Sitti said.\n\nAnother challenge lies in commercialization, and whether companies can bring these technologies to market, which may prove difficult until investors are convinced that these tiny robots can be used to effectively treat disease. Though one startup, Bionaut Labs, is planning clinical trials within the next two years for its robots — microrobotic devices that can be injected into the human body and guided to the brain with magnets to treat brain disorders like the congenital brain malformation known as Dandy-Walker syndrome and certain brain tumors, Agence France-Presse reports.\n\nBut much of the future of microrobotics will likely rest in the ability to manufacture these devices at scale. “Manufacturing is a key for any technology improvement,” Li said.\n\nThree-dimensional printing is one promising technique, according to Sitti, though he cautions that while it could prove effective for medical applications where costs can be high, lower-cost options — like roll-to-roll systems and molding-based approaches — are needed to scale manufacturing for uses outside biomedical, in areas like environmental monitoring.\n\nManufacturing, cost and other barriers aside, the potential benefits of microrobotics to change how we respond to disease and our environment will fuel even greater advances in the field.\n\n“With some successful results, then hopefully, the whole field will even speed up more,” Sitti said.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",
      "# [What Is Caching? (Definition, How It Works, Types) by Mamta Singh on 2024-04-08](https://builtin.com/articles/caching)\nIn computing, the term caching refers to storing frequently accessed data temporarily in a faster memory or storage. This process improves performance by reducing the time and resources needed to fetch data from its main source. When data is cached, users can access the data faster than if it needed to come from slower storage, such as a disk or over the network.\n\nMore in Software EngineeringWhat Should You Look for When Hiring a Prompt Engineer?\n\nHow Does Caching Work?\n\nWhen a program needs to access particular data, it first checks the cache memory to see if it’s available. If the program finds the data there, that’s called a cache hit, and it retrieves the data quickly. If the data is not there, that’s called a cache miss, and the program then fetches the data from the main storage, such as a file or a web page, and adds it in the cache for future use.\n\nWeb browsers, for example, cache information such as images and scripts. When you revisit a website, the browser quickly loads the cached data instead of downloading it again, resulting in faster page load times.\n\nCache has limited storage space. If there is no room for the new data, the program uses cache replacement policy to remove older data from the cache to make room for the new data. For example, least recently accessed or least frequently used data may be removed. In some cases, cached data may need to be invalidated if it’s no longer relevant to ensure cache accuracy.\n\nCaching Benefits\n\nCaching comes with a number of other upsides:\n\nFaster Data Access: Caching can significantly reduce response time to access frequently requested data.\n\nImproved Performance: Lower data access latency improves overall computing performance by allowing applications to execute tasks quickly.\n\nResource Usage and Scalability: By reducing the load on the main data source, caching helps reduce resource usage, including lower CPU usage, disk I/O and network traffic. This makes the system more efficient and scalable.\n\nOffline Access: In some cases, caching allows users to access data or content offline, such as cached web page elements. This improves the user experience for those with limited connectivity.\n\nCost Savings: Due to lower resource usage and higher scalability, caching saves the cost of maintaining the main data source.\n\nTypes of Caching\n\nThere are several different types of cache used in computer systems. Here are some examples:\n\nBrowser Cache\n\nWeb browsers store images, scripts and style sheets locally. When a user returns to a web page they’ve previously browsed, the website can quickly retrieve content stored in browser cache and rearrange it without having to load everything all over again. This results in faster load times and a smoother online user experience.\n\nDisk Cache\n\nThis buffer cache is used in hard drives and solid-state drives to temporarily store recently accessed data from the disk while also improving read and write performance.\n\nDNS Cache\n\nDomain Name System, or DNS, servers maintain cache of domain name to IP addresses mapping. For example, if the domain name is Dropbox.com, it’s translated to an IP address like 162.125.1.18. This mapping from domainname<>ipaddress gets stored in DNS cache. When the next hit comes, the program won’t need to go to the main server to find the IP address for a domain.\n\nApplication Cache\n\nSome applications, such as database systems and web servers, implement custom caching to store frequently accessed data or query results to improve application responsiveness.\n\nCPU Cache\n\nCaching was initially invented to speed up code and data access by the CPU, or computer processing unit. The L1 cache, located on the CPU chip, is useful for frequently used code instructions and data to stop programs constantly fetching from the slower memory. The larger L2 cache serves as secondary storage, and is located closer to the CPU than the main memory. Finally, an even larger L3 cache can be shared among multiple CPU cores for frequently accessed data across those cores.\n\nCaching Use Cases\n\nBesides the types of caching described above, there are many other use cases that demonstrate the benefits of caching.\n\nCDNs\n\nContent Delivery Networks, or CDNs, cache static content such as images, videos and installation files across distributed edge servers located closer to users. This process reduces latency, improves speed and saves on costs for data access across geographically distributed audiences.\n\nSession Caching\n\nSession caching stores session data, including user authentication tokens during user sessions. This speeds up user interactions in web applications.\n\nOperating Systems\n\nOperating systems and file systems use caching to store recently accessed files or file metadata. This accelerates file read/write performance and reduces disk access to improve speed.\n\nSearch Engines\n\nSearch engines cache search results and indexed web pages to deliver faster search query responses.\n\nResources for Software EngineersCompanies Hiring AI Engineers\n\nCaching Best Practices\n\nCaching plays a significant role in optimizing system performance and improving user experience. The following suggestions will help you create an efficient caching strategy.\n\n1. Develop a Clear Goal\n\nEstablish goals that caching needs to accomplish, whether it be faster web page loading or an improved search engine experience. Take into account multiple audience segments as well to design a caching strategy that benefits the most users possible.\n\n2. Select a Cache Storage\n\nChoose a cache storage type that fulfills your goals and user needs. Depending on the application, in-memory caches like Redis or Memcached may work best. Otherwise, it might make more sense to use disk-based or distributed caches like Hazelcast or Apache Ignite.\n\n3. Prepare Your Data\n\nIdentify the data to cache in your application. Data that’s frequently accessed and does not change often is usually a good choice. Consider pre-loading this data into the cache on startup or during low-traffic periods.\n\n4. Develop Caching Strategies\n\nUse cache invalidation strategy to keep the cached data accurate. For instance, you might use time or event-based invalidation to invalidate state data. Implement cache-backing strategies, such as read-through and write-through, to ensure data consistency between the cache and main data source. Design cache keys to ensure efficient data retrieval and utilization. When applicable, implement tiered or layered cache to further optimize latency and performance.\n\n5. Protect Your Cache\n\nTake steps to secure cached data. Set up end-to-end encryption, strict access controls and other safeguards to defend against cyber attacks. To limit opportunities for hackers to strike, implement error handling and fallback to handle failures and timeouts gracefully.\n\n6. Evaluate Cache Performance\n\nMonitor cache performance including usage, hit rates and eviction rates. Adjust your strategy accordingly based on the results. Pick a shorter cache expiration period for volatile data and a longer expiration period for relatively static data. Stay aware of this timeline while observing cache to make sure it’s followed.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

Predator removing his mask still doesn’t work. Haven’t checked my Dragon Ball skins yet but I bet they won’t cycle between saiyan forms either. If Epic Games won’t fix the built-in transformation emotes then at least give us the alternate forms as locker selectable outfits. At least the DB skins you can already choose which variant of saiyan you want to main. But for Neymar and Predator, the only way you can play as their alternate outfits is if you transform in-game, so those styles are gone completely for the time being.

There is more info in the initial PR comment and [help entry](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/73de98256cf3932dca156fbfd0c82c1cc10d487e/runtime/doc/various.txt#L561-L597), but for the lazy:\n\n- All it does is out of the box mappings:\n    - `gc` operator (Normal and Visual mode) to toggle comments.\n    - `gc` textobject (Operator-pending mode) as operator target.\n    - `gcc` for toggling comments in current line (basically a convenient `gc_` remap).\n\n    Also, of course, dot-repeat, `[count]` support, etc.\n\n- This is basically a simplified version of ['mini.commment'](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-comment.md) with *mostly* default config.\n\n  The `pad_comment_parts` is `false` meaning that 'commentstring' option is taken as is, without forcing single space padding. This is planned to be addressed by adjusting default 'commentstring' values some time later (at least after 0.10.0 release) or can be done by users themselves in their configs.\n\n- On the surface it is quite close to 'tpope/vim-commentary', but with some difference in how it handles blank lines: blank lines are commented but do not affect the toggle action decision. See example in [this comment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/28176#issuecomment-2039299762).\n\nSo if you are using only basics of 'mini.comment' (no custom hooks, options, or callable 'commentstring's) or 'tpope/vim-commentary', you might find the new built-in commenting on Nightly to be enough.\n\n### Comment ID kyfvsyi with +4 score by [(Vorrnth, Reddit, 2024-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1bwlvrt/neovim_now_has_builtin_commenting/kyfvsyi/) (in reply to ID ky6u01s):\nWill that support block comments?\n\n#### Comment ID kyfwse3 with +4 score by [(echasnovski, Reddit, 2024-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1bwlvrt/neovim_now_has_builtin_commenting/kyfwse3/) (in reply to ID kyfvsyi):\nNot yet.

For a few reasons\n\n1. It looks like the implementation of comment/uncomment is with treesitter. Though heavily encouraged, parsers are an optional dependency. So that means gc will work inconsistently if you don't have the right language installed. I can't think of any other Vim feature with inconsistent UX like this\n\n2. Usually moving X feature into core is done because either A. lower level interactivity with Neovim's code base (the C language) is needed for some reason. It could be because the Lua APIs don't exist or for performance reasons, whatever. B. The release cycle of X feature tracks closely with Neovim's own release schedule so having the code be a separate plugin wasn't useful. It might as well be in the core if it isn't updating often. FWIW I think commenting only satisfies B if you decouple the language support, which is what this PR ended up doing. But then you get problem #1. As a commenter plugin though, the logic and language queries were bundled so these separate parts were closer together.\n\n3. gc as a mapping - Historically I think gc as a default plugin mapping had an uncomfortable truce with it an other builtin mappings like gd, gD, g\\* and other actual \"goto\" mappings. When commenting was an optional plugin, gc was then an opt-in mapping that people could change to something else if they wanted to. Now it's part of the editor and you can't opt-in, it's opt out. So we have a new inconsistent mapping in the editor.\n\nBtw I love your plugins. targets.vim has been broken in macro recordings for forever and mini.ai saved the day. I just think this made more sense as a plugin.\n\n### Comment ID ky74vn9 with +58 score by [(echasnovski, Reddit, 2024-04-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1bwlvrt/neovim_now_has_builtin_commenting/ky74vn9/) (in reply to ID ky72oce):\n> It looks like the implementation of comment/uncomment is with treesitter.\n\nIt uses buffer's `'commentstring'`. **Only** if there is a tree-sitter managed node under cursor and **only** it is for language with a proper `'commentstring'` option, then that option is used.

I redact #1 since you've handled this concern well!\n\nMy point about gc is this is another inconsistent mapping, not there are no inconsistent g mappings. gd is close to gc on a qwerty keyboard which is why I mentioned it. We can find some g examples to the contrary but there's already many many more goto mappings like gd, gf, gg, G, gm, gn, gN, g\\^, g0, g\\_, g# etc.\n\nIMO though your C for #2 is a bit subjective. vim-fugitive is incredibly useful and the source code comparable in size to this PR.

No vfx graph.\n\nURP: some things are still not implemented, for example there is no eye adaptation post processing effect.\n\nHDRP: it's too heavy for lower end devices or vr.\n\n**Now, for the main pros:**\n\nBuilt-in: you are not limiting yourself to any platform, either with performance or quality. PC, VR, mobile - anything goes. \n\nURP: you can squeeze more performance for low-end devices, while being able to use fancy new features shared with HDRP.\n\nHDRP: you can aim for AAA graphics.\n\n**Afterthoughts:**\n\nSince built-in also got shadergraph, I see not too much reason to go with URP. Personally, I prefer jabbing at hlsl, as this allows me to build on standard shader, which I use a lot. You can't modify standard shader via shadergraph (until you pay for someone's attempt to emulate it).\n\nIt's a question whether the additional things you need, like ocean and clouds, have a good enough representation on asset store.

This is great for indie games because you can change the material color to change how objects look, allowing you to get more out of your assets, and you don't waste so much time on texture atlases.\n\nI would say anyone starting a new project should use one of the new pipelines.\n\n### Comment ID kiho5vb with +2 score by [(McDev02, Reddit, 2024-01-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1235qtz/builtin_vs_urp_in_2023/kiho5vb/) (in reply to ID jduuaj0):\nCan you explain, why is URP better in that regard of multiple materials?

[https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SRPBatcher.html](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SRPBatcher.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I doubt that the use of texture atlasses (saving materials) woun't boost performance in URP too. \n\nIt does boost performance, it is just not as necessary. You see the [BiRP](https://i.imgur.com/tq5mVJ5.png) only gets 14% - 27% of max performance without an atlas. However [URP](https://i.imgur.com/tSYPDqN.png) gets 73% of max performance without any atlas. However both have the same max performance.\n\nSo while using atlases will still allow you to squeeze out that last 27%, it is not something you have to focus on. When you do focus on atlases, URP also gives you better performance if you can't fit all your models on one atlas.\n\nMeaning in most cases URP outshines BiRP.",

Instead, each layoff added pressure to current employees who then had to triple their work load for no additional pay. One time I heard the CEO tell people in the office that they should get back to work, when they were talking about an INTERNAL committee they were on and tasked with. The office is a graveyard with a requirement to come in even though 90% of the desks are empty and one half of the office doesn't even have the lights on anymore. I hate office days because it is eerily quiet and the days are depressing. CEO and VPs are the definition of toxic. They are always on expensive vacations abroad while everyone else is worked to the bone, and the \"unlimited PTO/ half day Fridays\" are a joke. I never get to take a half day on a Friday because of the added work load, and hands get slapped if you take a day off even if it is for mental health. \n\nDEI is nonexistent.\n\nI do not see the culture or anything about the company improving because the same VPs and higher ups are always safe, who are truly causing the issues. They should be embarrassed but their egos are too big to ever feel that way. \n\nAlso base pay is a joke compared to any other company.",

I was also “quiet hired” to take on additional responsibilities without a raise or promotion. It was very discouraging to discover that Built In is engaged in the very practices it publicly preaches against. \n\nThe work-life balance was terrible. I worked until 10 or 11 most nights and most weekends, too. This was common on my team. We had to keep up with unreasonable KPIs while leaders resisted our attempts to improve processes. \n\nMany of the perks are mostly performative. If you want to use a wellness day to recover from burnout, you have to scramble twice as hard to get set up for your absence. Half-day Fridays are cool in theory, except the majority of my team worked Friday afternoons anyway to keep up with unreasonable workloads. Unlimited PTO apparently does have limits, a colleague was once told that they shouldn’t take more than ~13 days, and it is possible to get written up for “excessive PTO.” \n\nSo the company loves to dangle these perks as differentiators when they lack meaning in practice.\n\nThere have been four layoffs since October 2022. Two public RIFs, a quiet restructuring, and a more recent silent layoff where remaining employees only found out through LinkedIn posts from their impacted colleagues. Despite the writing on the wall, the leadership remains toxically positive, bordering on delusion. At all-hands meetings, the CEO espouses a hustle mentality, insinuating that the grind and a positive attitude will pay off for everyone (except those who were laid off, obviously) and that the company is winning. I’ll never forget when – a few days after the second RIF – the company kicked off the next all-hands with upbeat pop music and the CEO telling the remaining staff to stay off LinkedIn because it was too depressing.\n\nI’m sure there will be a careful response to this review, as there is on all of the others. So I'll proactively say, in regards to pay transparency that would have addressed my pay disparity, the company said \"they were working on it\" for 2 years and eventually rolled out a disappointing, opaque process. And ultimately, they can’t say anything to change my experience – but I’m one of the few who got off easy. Many others are afraid to post their honest accounts of working at Built In out of concern for the NDA signed in exchange for severance during the many layoffs. \n\nMy advice to jobseekers considering a job here? Do NOT buy into the gospel or sacrifice yourself. Negotiate the heck out of your job offer and always remember: you are disposable.",

In Q1 of this year, we shared our DEI roadmap with the entire company which included our current demographic breakdown and our strategies for the year. In addition to other initiatives, we are highly focused on attracting a more diverse workforce this year. For example, we’ve launched partnerships with networks of diverse professionals and we’re also providing training and resources to our hiring teams to mitigate bias. We will share updates on our progress in Q3 and we also will welcome feedback through our annual Inclusion Survey and other channels. We also encourage you to reach out to our Senior Director, DEI to share any recommendations you may have.",

It's for people who are hungry, and that's probably the biggest pro we've got.\r\n\r\nThe team at Built In, regardless of department, is a fervent entrepreneurial set. That makes sense, since our primary goal is to help companies grow and prosper. But it's also good news internally: We're growing like crazy and have sky-high goals, and we come in each and every day eager to build, rather than celebrate yesterday’s successes (and there are plenty). Every player on the team is passionate, forward-thinking, collaborative, humble — and working first and foremost toward what’s best for the company. \r\n\r\nEven still, that mentality unlocks plenty of professional growth. In my three-plus years at Built In, I have watched my peers grow into outstanding leaders of the company. I’ve cheered them on as they’ve chased new opportunities and tackled increasingly larger challenges, and they’ve done the same for me. And every new member of every single team has just as much opportunity to step up in a similar fashion. \r\n\r\nSo, yeah, Built In isn’t for everybody. But for those of us who prefer to keep those sleeves rolled up, you couldn’t ask for a more fulfilling place to work — or a better team to do it with.",

We will continue to work with managers to evolve the paths and welcome employee feedback on how they can be improved over time. Also, we introduced manager training this year. Our goal is to give managers the tools to help grow and develop their teams. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to diversity, we are proud to report that over 57% of our population identify as women, which is a rare achievement in Tech. Moreover, over 55% of all managers identify as women, too. \r\n\r\nThat said, we recognize we have work to do but we are committed to improving DEI at Built In. This year, we made additional investments towards recruiting folks from historically underrepresented groups in tech. Also, we now have a dedicated Senior Director, DEI who is responsible for the creation and delivery of our DEI Roadmap. The DEI Roadmap is shared with both our Board and our employees, to increase transparency and accountability. We encourage you to reach out to our Senior Director, DEI with any recommendations on how you think we can make improvements and we look forward to sharing results from 2022 in Q4 and unveiling our 2023 roadmap early next year.",

In regards to the state of the business and performance in the market, we conduct monthly company-wide meetings to review business priorities and status of goals and performance. We also provide a forum for employees to submit questions that get answered during each of those meetings. In our latest Engagement Survey, 80% of employees reported that the leaders at Built In keep people informed about what is happening. \n\nAs for pay transparency, the People Team has committed to it as a strategic roadmap item and we are in progress and on track for our pay transparency project. This is a major project that requires a lot of data analysis, auditing, process building and stakeholder participation on the backend. We want to make sure that we are building a scalable program that clearly defines our compensation philosophy and provides employees and candidates with the insight they need for their roles. The beginning of the salary band rollout will take place at the end of Q4 and likely be finalized early in Q1.",

Last year we introduced an annual Inclusion Survey, dedicated to gathering employee feedback that would shape our annual DEI roadmap. We had over 60% of our employees participate in the survey, and we presented the results during a company-wide meeting including highlighting both our areas of strengths and areas of opportunity. While we are proud of our gender diversity (&gt;50% of our employees identify as women), we recognize we still have work to do to increase our intersectional representation across the business and have initiatives in place within our roadmap to accomplish this goal. \r\n\r\nRegarding our Leadership team, we care deeply about career development at Built In and are grateful that 3 of our 12 (25%) leaders have begun their careers with us as individual contributors and over their tenure have grown into VPs. That said, 75% of our leadership team have 10-15+ years of external experience across Growth, Enterprise, and Fortune 500 companies. \r\n\r\nCommitment to transparent communications is one of the top priorities of our leadership team, which is why we conduct a monthly company-wide meeting to ensure our employees are looped in to our top strategic initiatives and happenings across the business. We encourage employees to submit questions for our Q&amp;A portion of that meeting to ensure they have answers to any outstanding questions and are informed on the topics that are important to them. In addition, we have invested in training for all managers focused on feedback and coaching - it is our expectation that feedback is continuous and based on observable behaviors. We’ll continue to work on driving transparency across all levels of the business and appreciate you taking the time to flag this opportunity for improvement to us.",

In particular, Built In's regular practice of bribing people who are leaving to sign a non-disparagement agreement in order to get severance pay should stop you—a person reading Glassdoor reviews—in your tracks. I refused to sign, even though they offered me a month's salary to do so, which is why I am legally able to leave this review. Think about all the people who got laid off (1/4 of their workforce in fall 2022 alone) who needed that money and decided to sign. You're not hearing from them here, which radically juices the company's ratings as an employer. Core values are not taken seriously by leadership. I regularly tried to lead with solutions by \"poking holes and offering ideas to patch them up,\" as they like to say, and was told to put my head down and keep these thoughts to myself. Even easy-to-implement fixes that everyone could agree on were regularly sidelined due politics or personalities. People who don't take the hint here are asked to resign or laid off at the first opportunity. Content leaders don't believe in the expertise of content creators and do not want them to \"do more.\" Despite being told when I was hired that they were looking for someone who would bring new ideas, strategies and processes to the team, they really wanted a cog in a machine who would shovel content through the mill, not someone interested in raising—or even maintaining—quality or standards. DEI at Built In is all talk and no action. As a hiring manager, I struggled to diversify our very homogeneous team, but the candidate pool was very white and male in every one of the 9 or so hires I was directly involved in. I asked HR for help in expanding this pool and they refused, telling me I needed to come up with my own strategies to expand the applicant pool because they were too busy to offer support. Several candidates of color made it to the final round, only to be denied by leaders or HR for not passing the personality test they make candidates take or not having the right disposition, look or \"culture fit.\" In fact, it was an open secret (on my team, at least) that HR is pretty much useless after you're onboarded. Every time I reached out with a \"people team\" issue, HR would take days or weeks to even respond. I repeatedly had to follow up on my own emails just to get a response! The eventual reply was usually to cut and paste sections of the handbook (that I'd obviously already read) or send URLs to outside advice articles (that they'd already asked managers to read). Then they would schedule follow-up meetings with me to see what I had done to fix the issue on my own, filling up my already stuffed calendar with garbage check-ins to clear themselves of accountability. I've literally never had to deal with a less valuable HR group in my nearly two decades in the professional workforce. I witnessed first-hand multiple occasions of the content studio team being undermined or stabbed in the back by petty managers and leaders on the news team and thrown under the bus by a leaderless sales team. I personally tried to create bonds between these teams to create some empathy between them, but eventually gave up in disgust.",

While we can’t address each of your comments effectively in this forum, we do want to touch on a few of them. \r\n \r\nFirst, we echo your kudos for our writers – we agree wholeheartedly that they are talented, passionate, and hardworking!  We are also pleased to hear that you feel you were able to achieve a healthy work-life balance during your time with us.  This is critically important to the leaders of our organization at every level. We were also glad to hear that you found value in the manager training options provided by the People Team, ranging from our Manager CORE training from LifeLabs to our introduction of Paradigm Reach, an on-demand DEI learning tool. \r\n \r\nWe do take exception to your comment that requesting a non-disparagement covenant as a condition of receiving severance pay is somehow inappropriate. Please know that it’s standard practice to include a severance pay offer in a standard separation agreement containing customary terms and conditions, including a non-disparagement covenant.  \r\nWe acknowledge your concern regarding our lack of diversity.  We recognize that we still have work to do and we are working on strategies to diversify the applicant pool so that we can continue our initiative to improve DEI at Built In.\r\n \r\nFinally, we are proud of our managers (especially the individual who managed you during your employment with us), who encourage a variety of opinions and discourse, as well as our HR team for being responsive to the questions and viewpoints of our team. We are disappointed to learn that you feel your ideas were not given appropriate attention. It’s important to us that everyone feels valued for the contributions they bring to work every day!\r\n \r\nWe would like the opportunity to further explore your concerns now that we are aware of them, and we encourage you to reach out any time to our People Team. Thank you again.",

Like most companies, we re-forecasted and our Sales reps have a clear path to attainment. \r\n \r\nWith that goal in mind, we were faced with challenging decisions. In October, we made the difficult decision to implement a workforce reduction that impacted 23% of our employees. \r\n \r\nThis was an incredibly hard decision and one that we hoped we would never need to make.  When looking at the impact on the business as a result of this economic downturn, we needed to evaluate current staffing levels and bring them into alignment with the reality of our business needs. Our goal is to make the transition for affected employees as smooth as possible. To do that, every affected employee was offered severance pay, continuation coverage under our health insurance and Modern Health benefits through the end of November, and the ability to keep their company-issued laptop for their job search.",

The CEO is convinced that the product is an enterprise offering, but it cannot support large companies. There is also a push to move internationally before the product provides value in US markets.\r\n\r\nExperienced leaders turn over quickly and then they are blamed for the failings of the company. It's a burnout factory where the CEO can't stand it if someone else's ideas are successful. Once you challenge, you are pushed out.\r\n\r\nThe senior sales team is comprised of some of inexperienced sales people who are friends with leadership. \r\n\r\nThe product is old technology and poorly integrated across sites. There is enough technical debt to cripple the platform, but it is never addressed because they are always pursuing shiny objects with no proof that there is market need for the solution.\r\n\r\nPoor planning, lack of strategy and, copycat mentality have resulted in four layoffs over the past 2 years. Even when they promise that it will be the last.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of talk about the company being people first and valuing diversity. It's lip service.\r\n\r\nIf you want to just show up and agree with the leadership, you'll do fine. If you want to get anything done or make an impact, look elsewhere.",

Employee success, culture, wellness, and actual happiness are at the forefront of how Built In treats their employees regardless of the market. I can honestly say I ENJOY working each day, and so do those around me.

Please know that we do read these, share with leadership, and work collaboratively to make appropriate improvements based on these insights.\r\n\r\nBuilt In has always operated with a people-first mindset, and we agree that there are great, hard working, caring employees who make Built In what it is.\r\n\r\nLike many others, Built In has been impacted by today’s market and the macro economics surrounding the industry. To those employees who were impacted by layoffs, we offered competitive packages, provided resume and interviewing coaching, and offered personal introductions to companies who are hiring. \r\n\r\nWe are doing our best to navigate this new normal and make decisions in the best interest of our people as well as the business.For example, we encourage all of our leaders to manage their teams independently, while cohesively operating under unified values and business practices. What works for one team may not work for another. Which is why we’ve introduced a Flex Work Policy for all of our employees. We offer both Flex Mode and Remote Mode, where you may have the opportunity to work remotely based on your role and function - or enjoy the perks of being in the office on a hybrid schedule. Some departments may choose to designate additional in-office days, but our philosophy is to encourage flexibility to support personal work styles while balancing business needs.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to our leadership, we are proud to have a leadership team with an average tenure of 7.75 years. When you have a group of individuals who work together for that long, it’s natural that friendships form and we’re proud of the deep trust this team has in each other. It allows us to move fast, be innovative, and have deep alignment with our strategic initiatives. The leaders who we’ve brought on board over the last 1-2 years came in for growth and those leaders are not always the type of leaders who can operate in market downturns.  We’re proud of the leaders we have in place and their commitment to supporting and empowering our people is unwavering. \r\n\r\nIf you have additional questions or other concerns you’d like us to address - please feel free to get in touch directly!",

Priorities are constantly changing because there is not a pulse on macro conditions, nor around company or applicant needs. -Rotating leadership positions. Since 2019 there have been at least, count ‘em, 5+ exec (VP and above, including C level ) positions that have left within ~1 year of their start date. Not even counting the numerous 'Director' level positions that have come and gone. Look into median (instead of average) tenure of leadership positions. -Siloed functions. Teams don't work together within their functions, nor do they collaborate across functions. What is product working on? No idea because a product roadmap is not communicated broadly. -Culture. Toxic, plain and simple. Watch out for the most tenured employees, especially in sales and up to the founder and cofounder. Either get in line or prepare to be ostracized. Leading with solutions is a value, but only if it jives with the CEO's agenda. Otherwise, speaking up will mark you for a PIP or for layoffs. -Career progression. Ask HR, there has been a plan for career laddering the last 3 years with no implementation. DE&amp;I is a facade and the team should spend more time focusing on improving culture, community, and investigating employee concerns rather than vanity metrics or responding to these reviews.",

We genuinely appreciate your honesty and openness about your experience with Built In, and are glad to hear you’re enjoying the benefit of our ½ day Fridays. \n\nWe are sorry to hear about your negative experiences, particularly with our senior sales team and leadership. Like most tech companies, we were impacted by the most recent market downturn and experienced the need to downsize some of our sales team members. We are in an economic climate that demands constant change of organizations, and our leadership team is dedicated to the success of our people as we emerge stronger than ever before. We continue to invest in developing as people-leaders, as the success of any organization is deeply rooted in the satisfaction and well-being of its employees. \n\nWe take pride in our offerings, and we are disappointed to hear that you found them subpar. We are constantly working to enhance our products and services, and have invested heavily in these by bringing in a Chief Technology Officer and doubling down on R&amp;D to get us to a spot to go international in the near future. We are pleased to say that our products will continue to be enhanced in our pursuit of delivering top results to our tech visitors and customers. \n\nIf you are open to it, we would appreciate the opportunity to discuss your concerns in more detail and gather additional insights that can help us address specific issues. You can reach out directly to our CEO or to our Head of People at any time.  We take all feedback seriously, and your insights are invaluable as we continuously strive to improve our organization.",

We only wish you would have done so while you were employed with us, as we would have appreciated the opportunity to address these issues directly with you.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to be an organization built and led by women. Individuals who identify as women account for 58% of our employee population, 55% of all managers and 53% of our leadership team. \r\n\r\nWe conducted our first annual anonymous DEI survey in Q4 of 2021 and across the board, women rated our company more favorably than their peers. For example, participants who identified as women gave the following ratings:\r\n- 96% favorability for “I feel respected at Built In,” \r\n- 91% favorability for “I feel like I belong at Built In,”\r\n- 87% favorability for “At Built In there is open and honest two-way communication” \r\n- 81% favorable for “I can voice a contrary opinion without fear of negative consequences” \r\nWe’re disappointed that you don’t feel you had a similar experience while you were employed with us.\r\n\r\nWe take the safety and wellbeing of our employees very seriously. We conduct annual harassment prevention training for all employees and recently invested in a platform that is trauma-informed, trigger free, and provides the most marginalized individuals with additional resources. \r\n\r\nWe have a longstanding written anti-harassment policy that provides multiple reporting avenues.  Again, we wish you had utilized our policy and brought your concerns to our attention during your employment with us, as we would have followed our outlined protocol by asking you to provide the facts underlying your concerns and promptly investigating those concerns. \r\n\r\nWe would like the opportunity to investigate your concerns now that you have made us aware of them, so we encourage you to reach out directly to any member of our People Team so that we can obtain the additional information we need in order to do so.  Thank you again.\r\n\r\nWe’re surprised to hear your comment about a lack of diversity. While we recognize that we have work to do and we are committed to fulfilling the commitments of our annual DEI roadmap, we can confirm that every department in our company has diverse representation.",

We’re so glad that you felt connected to your teammates and the people around you. \r\n\r\nAs a recruitment marketing platform, our customers often reside in HR &amp; Talent positions. We have seen great success in hiring folks from the staffing world as they deeply understand our buyer persona and our industry as a whole! That said, Built In has always been committed to hiring top talent, and prioritizes both diversity of thought and experience - especially for roles that manage people.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to build long lasting teams with inspired leaders, and we are proud to share that our employees have an overall average tenure of 3.1 years, with Management at an average tenure of 4.4 Years. Specifically on our Account Management team the average employee tenure is 3.4 years, with a management tenure of 4.9 years. This is well above the industry average, which is something we are incredibly proud of.\r\n\r\nRegarding our Revenue infrastructure, we endeavor to set our teams up for optimal success, and recognize there are always areas for improvement. While we absolutely make mistakes, we make what we believe to be the best decisions based on the information we had at that time. Most importantly, those decisions and changes are always well-intentioned with the Account Manager and customer as the priority. However, what worked years ago, does not always continue to be the best approach. The past 12 months forced us to move swiftly related to territories/books, commission structure and we’re proud of the changes we’ve made in the positive direction the past 6 months to allow for a more equitable and predictable environment.\r\n\r\nThanks again for sharing your thoughts.

In my three-plus years at Built In, I have watched my peers grow into outstanding leaders of the company. I’ve cheered them on as they’ve chased new opportunities and tackled increasingly larger challenges, and they’ve done the same for me. And every new member of every single team has just as much opportunity to step up in a similar fashion. \r\n\r\nSo, yeah, Built In isn’t for everybody.

In particular, Built In's regular practice of bribing people who are leaving to sign a non-disparagement agreement in order to get severance pay should stop you—a person reading Glassdoor reviews—in your tracks. I refused to sign, even though they offered me a month's salary to do so, which is why I am legally able to leave this review. Think about all the people who got laid off (1/4 of their workforce in fall 2022 alone) who needed that money and decided to sign. You're not hearing from them here, which radically juices the company's ratings as an employer. Core values are not taken seriously by leadership. I regularly tried to lead with solutions by \"poking holes and offering ideas to patch them up,\" as they like to say, and was told to put my head down and keep these thoughts to myself. Even easy-to-implement fixes that everyone could agree on were regularly sidelined due politics or personalities. People who don't take the hint here are asked to resign or laid off at the first opportunity. Content leaders don't believe in the expertise of content creators and do not want them to \"do more.\" Despite being told when I was hired that they were looking for someone who would bring new ideas, strategies and processes to the team, they really wanted a cog in a machine who would shovel content through the mill, not someone interested in raising—or even maintaining—quality or standards. DEI at Built In is all talk and no action. As a hiring manager, I struggled to diversify our very homogeneous team, but the candidate pool was very white and male in every one of the 9 or so hires I was directly involved in. I asked HR for help in expanding this pool and they refused, telling me I needed to come up with my own strategies to expand the applicant pool because they were too busy to offer support. Several candidates of color made it to the final round, only to be denied by leaders or HR for not passing the personality test they make candidates take or not having the right disposition, look or \"culture fit.\" In fact, it was an open secret (on my team, at least) that HR is pretty much useless after you're onboarded. Every time I reached out with a \"people team\" issue, HR would take days or weeks to even respond. I repeatedly had to follow up on my own emails just to get a response! The eventual reply was usually to cut and paste sections of the handbook (that I'd obviously already read) or send URLs to outside advice articles (that they'd already asked managers to read). Then they would schedule follow-up meetings with me to see what I had done to fix the issue on my own, filling up my already stuffed calendar with garbage check-ins to clear themselves of accountability. I've literally never had to deal with a less valuable HR group in my nearly two decades in the professional workforce. I witnessed first-hand multiple occasions of the content studio team being undermined or stabbed in the back by petty managers and leaders on the news team and thrown under the bus by a leaderless sales team. I personally tried to create bonds between these teams to create some empathy between them, but eventually gave up in disgust.",

Not even counting the numerous 'Director' level positions that have come and gone. Look into median (instead of average) tenure of leadership positions. -Siloed functions. Teams don't work together within their functions, nor do they collaborate across functions. What is product working on? No idea because a product roadmap is not communicated broadly. -Culture. Toxic, plain and simple. Watch out for the most tenured employees, especially in sales and up to the founder and cofounder. Either get in line or prepare to be ostracized. Leading with solutions is a value, but only if it jives with the CEO's agenda. Otherwise, speaking up will mark you for a PIP or for layoffs. -Career progression. Ask HR, there has been a plan for career laddering the last 3 years with no implementation.

        "cons": "While working here as a senior team member, I discovered I was paid less than new hires in junior roles, despite consistently being recognized as a top performer. I was also “quiet hired” to take on additional responsibilities without a raise or promotion. It was very discouraging to discover that Built In is engaged in the very practices it publicly preaches against. \n\nThe work-life balance was terrible. I worked until 10 or 11 most nights and most weekends, too. This was common on my team. We had to keep up with unreasonable KPIs while leaders resisted our attempts to improve processes. \n\nMany of the perks are mostly performative. If you want to use a wellness day to recover from burnout, you have to scramble twice as hard to get set up for your absence. Half-day Fridays are cool in theory, except the majority of my team worked Friday afternoons anyway to keep up with unreasonable workloads. Unlimited PTO apparently does have limits, a colleague was once told that they shouldn’t take more than ~13 days, and it is possible to get written up for “excessive PTO.” \n\nSo the company loves to dangle these perks as differentiators when they lack meaning in practice.\n\nThere have been four layoffs since October 2022. Two public RIFs, a quiet restructuring, and a more recent silent layoff where remaining employees only found out through LinkedIn posts from their impacted colleagues. Despite the writing on the wall, the leadership remains toxically positive, bordering on delusion. At all-hands meetings, the CEO espouses a hustle mentality, insinuating that the grind and a positive attitude will pay off for everyone (except those who were laid off, obviously) and that the company is winning. I’ll never forget when – a few days after the second RIF – the company kicked off the next all-hands with upbeat pop music and the CEO telling the remaining staff to stay off LinkedIn because it was too depressing.\n\nI’m sure there will be a careful response to this review, as there is on all of the others. So I'll proactively say, in regards to pay transparency that would have addressed my pay disparity, the company said \"they were working on it\" for 2 years and eventually rolled out a disappointing, opaque process. And ultimately, they can’t say anything to change my experience – but I’m one of the few who got off easy. Many others are afraid to post their honest accounts of working at Built In out of concern for the NDA signed in exchange for severance during the many layoffs. \n\nMy advice to jobseekers considering a job here?

Instead, each layoff added pressure to current employees who then had to triple their work load for no additional pay. One time I heard the CEO tell people in the office that they should get back to work, when they were talking about an INTERNAL committee they were on and tasked with. The office is a graveyard with a requirement to come in even though 90% of the desks are empty and one half of the office doesn't even have the lights on anymore. I hate office days because it is eerily quiet and the days are depressing. CEO and VPs are the definition of toxic. They are always on expensive vacations abroad while everyone else is worked to the bone, and the \"unlimited PTO/ half day Fridays\" are a joke. I never get to take a half day on a Friday because of the added work load, and hands get slapped if you take a day off even if it is for mental health. \n\nDEI is nonexistent.\n\nI do not see the culture or anything about the company improving because the same VPs and higher ups are always safe, who are truly causing the issues.

      "# [Introducing Instagram Teen Accounts: Built-In Protections for Teens, Peace of Mind for Parents by Meta, Facebook company on 2024-09-17](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/instagram-teen-accounts/)\nToday, we’re introducing Instagram Teen Accounts, a new experience for teens, guided by parents. Teen Accounts have built-in protections which limit who can contact them and the content they see, and also provide new ways for teens to explore their interests. We’ll automatically place teens into Teen Accounts, and teens under 16 will need a parent’s permission to change any of these settings to be less strict.\n\nReimagining Teens’ Experiences on Instagram\n\nWe know parents want to feel confident that their teens can use social media to connect with their friends and explore their interests, without having to worry about unsafe or inappropriate experiences. We understand parents’ concerns, and that’s why we’re reimagining our apps for teens with new Teen Accounts. This new experience is designed to better support parents, and give them peace of mind that their teens are safe with the right protections in place. Teens will also get access to a new feature, made just for them, that lets them select topics they want to see more of in Explore and their recommendations so they can focus on the fun, positive content they love.\n\nBuilt-In Protections To Address Parents’ Top Concerns\n\nWe developed Teen Accounts with parents and teens in mind. The new Teen Account protections are designed to address parents’ biggest concerns, including who their teens are talking to online, the content they’re seeing and whether their time is being well spent. These protections are turned on automatically, and parents decide if teens under 16 can change any of these settings to be less strict:\n\nPrivate accounts: With default private accounts, teens need to accept new followers and people who don’t follow them can’t see their content or interact with them. This applies to all teens under 16 (including those already on Instagram and those signing up) and teens under 18 when they sign up for the app. (Updated on September 17 at 11:18 AM PT to clarify how private accounts are applied)\n\nMessaging restrictions: Teens will be placed in the strictest messaging settings, so they can only be messaged by people they follow or are already connected to.\n\nSensitive content restrictions: Teens will automatically be placed into the most restrictive setting of our sensitive content control, which limits the type of sensitive content (such as content that shows people fighting or promotes cosmetic procedures) teens see in places like Explore and Reels.\n\nLimited interactions: Teens can only be tagged or mentioned by people they follow. We’ll also automatically turn on the most restrictive version of our anti-bullying feature, Hidden Words, so that offensive words and phrases will be filtered out of teens’ comments and DM requests.\n\nTime limit reminders: Teens will get notifications telling them to leave the app after 60 minutes each day.\n\nSleep mode enabled: Sleep mode will be turned on between 10 PM and 7 AM, which will mute notifications overnight and send auto-replies to DMs.\n\n“Given that parents today are grappling with the benefits and challenges of the internet and digital media for their teens, our association applauds Meta for launching Instagram Teen Accounts. With teens automatically placed in Teen Accounts and certain privacy settings turned on by default, this update demonstrates that Meta is taking steps to empower parents and deliver safer, more age-appropriate experiences on the platform.”\n\n– Yvonne Johnson, President, National PTA\n\nHow To Approve Changes To a Teen’s Settings\n\nTeens under 16 will need their parent’s permission to use less protective settings. To get permission, teens will need to set up parental supervision on Instagram. If parents want more oversight over their older teen’s (16+) experiences, they simply have to turn on parental supervision. Then, they can approve any changes to these settings, irrespective of their teen’s age.\n\nOnce supervision is established, parents can approve and deny their teens’ requests to change settings or allow teens to manage their settings themselves. Soon, parents will also be able to change these settings directly to be more protective. Learn more about how to manage Teen Accounts.\n\n“Instagram Teen Accounts reflect the importance of tailoring teens’ online experiences to their developmental stages, and implementing appropriate protections. Younger adolescents are more vulnerable as their skills are still emerging and require additional safeguards and protection. Overall, the settings are age-specific, with younger and older teens being offered different protections.”\n\n– Rachel Rodgers, PhD Associate Professor of Applied Psychology, Northeastern University\n\nMore Ways for Parents To Get Involved, If They Want\n\nWhile Teen Accounts put new protections in place automatically, many parents want to be even more involved in their teen’s experiences, so we’re also adding to our supervision feature. Updates include ways to:\n\nGet insights into who their teens are chatting with: While parents can’t read their teen’s messages, now they will be able to see who their teen has messaged in the past seven days.\n\nSet total daily time limits for teens’ Instagram usage: Parents can decide how much time their teen can spend on Instagram each day. Once a teen hits that limit, they’ll no longer be able to access the app.\n\nBlock teens from using Instagram for specific time periods: Parents can choose to block their teens from using Instagram at night, or specific time periods, with one easy button.\n\nSee topics your teen is looking at: Parents can view the age-appropriate topics their teen has chosen to see content from, based on their interests.\n\nHow We’re Enforcing Teen Accounts\n\nTeens may lie about their age and that’s why we’re requiring them to verify their age in more places, like if they attempt to use a new account with an adult birthday. We’re also building technology to proactively find accounts belonging to teens, even if the account lists an adult birthday. This technology will allow us to proactively find these teens and place them in the same protections offered by Teen Account settings. We’ll start testing this change in the US early next year. You can read more about those details here.\n\nHelping Ensure Teens See Age-Appropriate Content\n\nWe recognize parents are concerned that their teens might see mature or inappropriate content online, which is why we have stricter rules around the kinds of content teens see on our apps. We remove content that breaks our rules and avoid recommending potentially sensitive content – such as sexually suggestive content or content discussing suicide or self-harm. With Instagram Teen Accounts, teens will be placed into the strictest setting of our sensitive content control, so they’re even less likely to be recommended sensitive content, and in many cases we hide this content altogether from teens, even if it’s shared by someone they follow.\n\n“It’s important that safety and privacy protections are the default settings, both to improve teens’ online experience and to reduce some of the burden that has fallen to parents. We look forward to hearing from teens about their experience of these new Teen Accounts and associated features and settings.”\n\n– Dr. Megan Moreno, Co-Medical Director of the SAMHSA-Funded AAP Center of Excellence on Social Media and Youth Mental Health\n\nWhen To Expect These Changes\n\nToday, we’ll start placing teens who sign up for Instagram into Teen Accounts, and we’ll notify teens already using Instagram about these changes so we can begin moving them into Teen Accounts next week.\n\nWe plan to place teens into Teen Accounts within 60 days in the US, UK, Canada and Australia, and to start placing them in Teen Accounts in the European Union later this year. Teens around the world will start to get Teen Accounts in January. We’ll also bring Teen Accounts to other Meta platforms next year. These are big updates that will change the Instagram experience for millions of teens, and we need to make sure they work correctly.\n\n“These updates to Instagram’s Teen Accounts offer a balanced approach, empowering parents with essential oversight while respecting teens’ right to participate and explore. In an ever-evolving online world, this update ensures that young people can engage meaningfully and safely, fostering positive connections while still providing the protection they need.”\n\n– Lucy Thomas OAM, CEO & Co-Founder, Project Rockit",

      "# [Font with Built-In Syntax Highlighting](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41245159)\nWhat a fun hack!\n\nOne small note: the post seems slightly confused about the use of OpenType features, as it calls for:\n\nfont-feature-settings: \"colr\", \"calt\";\n\nbut there's no 'colr' feature tag in the font's OpenType layout tables, so that's meaningless here.\n\nI suppose this was intended to \"activate\" the color glyph table (COLR) in the font; but that isn't an OpenType layout feature that would be controlled by font-feature-settings, and doesn't need to be \"turned on\" like this.\n\n(In addition, the 'calt' feature is (according to the spec[1]) supposed to be active by default, so it shouldn't be necessary to explicitly set it either. And indeed, the font works for me in both Firefox and Chrome without this rule; sadly Safari doesn't seem to handle it.)\n\n[1] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/typography/opentype/spec/f...\n\nKudos * 1000 ! ! !\n\nImpossible before. It can't be less invasive: _original text stays intact_ - no wrapping tags.. no JS.. just works with userContent.css.. - simply another dimension.\n\n> I'm also not an OpenType expert, so I'm sure the substitution logics could be improved upon. I'm open to sharing the modified source file to anyone interested. If you have any ideas, suggestions or feedback, let me know. You can reach me at hlotvonen@gmail.com.\n\n- so, how far can it be improved then ?!\n\n- what other font editors moreover to Glyph (mac only) have good support for advanced contextual alternates ?\n\nThank you! (I'm the author) I'm also very curious to know if there's some nifty way of improving the lookup logic. What I did was kind of a brute force method, but on the other hand, the CALT \"language\" is very limited.\n\nFor font editors, Glyphs is the industry standard, and, as far as I know, there are not many good alternatives. There's FontForge, but its contextual alternate editing seems even more confusing: https://fontforge.org/docs/ui/dialogs/contextchain.html\n\nJust today I found out about a new browser based font editor, fontra, but it looks like editing OpenType features is still on its roadmap. Maybe something to keep an eye on though. https://fontra.xyz/\n\nYou should invent a new font type.\n\nYou asked what it takes to make a blog.\n\nI have a html front page, tag pages and posts. All static.\n\nThere is a pretty short php page that takes an existing post or the dummy, chops off everything in front and behind the text.\n\nThe tag cloud sits under it. Clicking a tag injects it under the text.\n\nWhen saved the top and bottom html are reatached and the title <h2> is copied into the <title> tag.\n\nIt then creates or overwrites the static html document.\n\nIt finds tags in the html and inserts a link to the new article into the tag and index pages.\n\nLoad, split, join and save is actually less complicated than sql and faster:)\n\nDeleting tags and blogpostings is done manually.\n\nBesides editpost.php there is a bookmarklet to inject quotes with links and youtube embeds.\n\nI am using 11ty for the blog, and it works great, for now. But there's two reasons I don't like it:\n\n1. I need to have two different versions of my site, dev and prod, which I find very restricting and fragile.\n\n2. I don't like to rely on other people updating their npm packages just so I could publish static content. I've been burned too many times by abandoned npm packages or breaking changes.\n\nIt's definitely going to be significantly slower as a result of all the contextual lookups.\n\nTo get an idea, I repeatedly duplicated the CSS in the \"tiny sandbox\" until there were nearly 20,000 lines there, and then profiled the operation of changing the font-size by 1px in Firefox. Reflowing the textbox took about 1.6 seconds.\n\nWith `font-feature-settings: \"calt\" off` applied, so that the contextual lookups aren't being run, a font-size change for that same textbox content reflows in about 100 milliseconds.\n\n(I don't have actual timings for the same example in Chrome, but subjectively, with \"calt\" disabled, the resize is near-instant, whereas with it enabled, it's quite laggy, similar to Firefox.)\n\nIn Firefox, 4000 lines of CSS: editing last lines is fast and instant, editing first lines is a bit jumpy refreshing every few edits in 0.2s-1.2s - however undo/redo is quite fast - but not so fast as with last lines, and.. from the first impression, guesses:\n\n-= the highlight is always there, instantly =- (or.. it doesn't a look like a reason for jumpy lines because of redo) - definintly less cycles and memory overhead and I don't see that possible with DOM and JS - the delays could be there only because of inefficient editing operations with no impact of coloring.. and maybe with.. smaller textfragments (or ?) there could be no such delays at all - but simple* coloring coud be always so instant (and easy) ? (yes, I know, so far it may be also limiting and exclusive)\n\nAnother issue you'd run into, I suspect, is that in practice text engines/editors/etc will often repaint only fragments of the content, and so the syntax highlighter would not necessarily see all the context it needs.\n\nE.g. if you have a comment that starts with \"/*\" and ends several lines later with \"*/\", but the editor decides to just redraw a line in the middle, the highlighter won't \"know\" to use the comment color as the text-drawing operation won't include the delimiters.\n\n(This issue already exists in a small way, as mentioned in https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41251114, but it'd only get worse as the syntax highlighter becomes more sophisticated.)\n\nAs an experiment, it is awesome. We should strive to push the limits of technology and try new things. Kudos. I tip my hat to the creativity.\n\nAs something practical, the author started with the wrong tool for the job (JavaScript), and then used an even more wrong tool for the same job (The font itself!)\n\nJust use a code editor with Syntax Highlighting! Vim solved this decades ago!\n\nVery interesting read, but don't try this at home.\n\nEdit: Pandora's box is opened, I can see Jira and GitHub rushing to add support for this on their websites starting tomorrow =)\n\n> Just use a code editor with Syntax Highlighting! Vim solved this decades ago!\n\nYou are aware that this blog post is about displaying syntax highlighted code on the web? This is literally explained in the first paragraphs of the blog post..\n\nAs of now there were four ways of doing that:\n\n1. using an image (which sucks)\n\n2. manually setting the colors (good luck)\n\n3. Generating the syntax highlighting server-side (preferred, but you need a backend that can do it)\n\n4. Generating it client side using JS (waste of energy, takes a time to finish)\n\nAnd now a font. Depending on the use case this could be a feasible option, although I am just waiting for this to be exploited in some fashion.\n\nI still think computing once styling later is preferable.",
      "# [Apple will start selling AirPods with built-in hearing aids by Rob Wile, Angela Yang on 2024-09-09](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/apple-will-start-selling-airpods-built-hearing-aids-rcna170293)\nApple said Monday that a version of its latest AirPods earbuds will come with built-in hearing aids, which it says would help more than 1 billion people globally.\n\nThe feature on the AirPods Pro, which Apple describes as equivalent to an over-the-counter hearing aid, is designed for users with mild to moderate hearing loss. After users take hearing tests on iPhones or iPads running iOS 18, their AirPods will make \"personalized dynamic adjustments\" to allow them to properly hear their immediate listening environments, with sounds boosted to prescribed levels in real time.\n\n\"This helps them better engage in conversation, and keeps them connected to the people and environment around them,\" Apple said.\n\nThe settings are also automatically applied to any media a user is listening to.\n\nThe hearing test takes about five minutes. Results, including audiograms, will be stored privately within the Health app.\n\nThe AirPods Pro will use the personalized hearing profile to inform how its hearing aid feature adjusts sounds in real time, including phone calls, music and other types of media.\n\nThe AirPods upgrade also includes a passive noise-reduction hearing loss \"prevention\" feature that automatically dampens ambient loud noises — while retaining audio integrity — which Apple says would come in handy at live concerts.\n\nApple noted that according to the World Health Organization, about 1.5 billion people around the world live with hearing loss.\n\n“For decades, Apple has led the way in designing products for everyone and supporting users with a broad spectrum of hearing abilities,” Sarah Herrlinger, Apple’s senior director of global accessibility policy and initiatives, said in a statement. “These features on AirPods Pro will make an impact on so many people by driving more awareness around hearing health and empowering individuals with new customizable tools to help them stay connected.”\n\nThe company also announced new Apple Watch features to detect sleep apnea. The device will use a “Breathing Disturbances” metric to trigger sleep apnea notifications, a feature that is expected to roll out this month after it is approved by global health authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",

      "# [Our Editorial Standards by Editorial Staff on 2023-05-17](https://builtin.com/editorial-standards)\nBuilt In’s editorial team publishes a range of journalistic content to help our audience of tech professionals keep up with emerging trends, deepen their understanding of technical concepts and develop skills that advance their careers. Our readers rely on our coverage in making important professional decisions, and we do not take this responsibility lightly.\n\nTo maintain the integrity and high quality of our coverage — and live up to the trust our readers put in us — we have detailed standards guiding our reporting and editing process as well as our interactions with sources and the companies we cover. This document provides an overview of these editorial standards, which are regularly updated to reflect journalistic best practices.\n\nReporting Process\n\nOur coverage builds on interviews with subject matter experts across the tech industry and academia as well as published research, reporting by other outlets and other publicly available information. When we rely on the work of others in our coverage, our practice is to always disclose where the information is coming from and link to the original material if it is available online.\n\nExpert Contributors\n\nOur expert columns are written by subject matter experts external to Built In’s editorial team; they can be easily identified by their prominent Expert Contributor Network badges. Expert columns are edited by our staff, and columnists are held to the same standards on plagiarism and proper attribution as our reporters. Note, however, that because presenting a broad range of perspectives is an important aim of our contributor program, expert columnists enjoy a wider latitude to express personal opinions than our reporters do. Views expressed by expert contributors do not necessarily reflect the views of Built In or its editorial staff.\n\nStory Updates\n\nMany Built In articles are intended to serve readers for years past their original publish dates. However, due to the fast-moving nature of the tech industry, parts of an article may become outdated even as its core takeaways remain useful. To ensure that our evergreen coverage remains relevant and accurate, Built In’s editorial team makes regular updates to published features, guides or explainers.\n\nThe extent of these updates can vary. In some cases, an added section will suffice to add new context, explain new developments surrounding a topic or provide relevant examples. In other cases, we may determine that an explainer would serve readers better if it were restructured, or that it might benefit from taking a broader view of the topic.\n\nWhen a story is updated by someone other than the original author, our editors will credit the new reporter. In certain cases, where updates constitute a majority of the current version of an article, editors may change a story’s byline and credit the original author for creating the first version of the story.\n\nCorrections\n\nWe strive for accuracy in all our coverage and our policy is to correct factual inaccuracies whenever they make it to publication. Such corrections are limited to facts that were inaccurate at the time of publication.\n\nExamples of factual inaccuracies that might warrant correction include:\n\nMisspelled names or titles\n\nIncorrect dates\n\nOutdated company statistics\n\nIncorrect biographical information\n\nDescriptions that misidentify a company’s core industry, product or services\n\nPlease note, however, that in the interest of space and readability for our broad audience of tech professionals, company descriptions may not incorporate the same level of nuance or detail that one might see in a trade publication.\n\nCorrections are only issued when a story contains factual errors. Common examples of change requests that cannot be accommodated include:\n\nAdding superlatives such as “top,” “best” or “industry-leading”\n\nPurely stylistic changes\n\nAdding bespoke terminology\n\nSubstituting factually correct terminology for preferred synonyms\n\nExpanding a story with non-essential supplemental details\n\n>Any edits that do not address a specific factual inaccuracy\n\nIn accordance with editorial industry best practices, our team cannot accept line edits or pass off copy provided by third parties as its own. Instead, we will work independently to understand the nature of the mistake and the best way to correct it.\n\nExpert Reviews\n\nSome Built In articles are reviewed for accuracy by external researchers and practitioners. These articles list the reviewer’s name in addition to an author byline and publish date. Expert reviews supplement our standard editing process and allow us to identify and address nuanced details that may not be apparent to lay readers. We strive to make assignments as specific to the reviewer’s area of specialty as possible; however, to avoid conflicts of interest, expert reviewers are not assigned stories covering their employers or their employers’ direct competitors.\n\nGenerative AI\n\nBuilt In uses generative AI to produce certain forms of news coverage. These articles are labeled on our site through the byline, author bio and an on-page disclaimer. AI-generated articles are created using information from press releases, company blogs and company websites, and they are always fact-checked and edited by a Built In editor to ensure accuracy.\n\nBranded Content\n\nTech companies partner with Built In to connect with talent, and they may be featured in branded content created by Built In’s Brand Studio as part of these partnerships. This content is labeled with a Brand Studio badge. Built In’s editorial staff does not participate in the creation of branded content. However, our editorial team does write about Built In clients from time to time as part of its regular tech coverage. All our editorial standards and policies remain in effect when covering Built In clients.\n\nContent Types\n\nBuilt In has several teams publishing a wide range of content — some paid, but most of it editorially independent. To maintain full transparency with our readers, this page outlines our different content types, how they are labeled and which content team is responsible for each.\n\nEditorial Content\n\nBuilt In employs reporters and editors to produce articles — features, news, explainers and more — that are designed to instruct, inform and inspire both established and aspiring technology professionals. We cover industry challenges with an eye toward solutions, highlighting how tech leaders and individual contributors alike can make a difference. We do not cover negative news stories about individual companies — like scandals, layoffs or shutdowns — irrespective of whether the company partners with Built In.\n\nOur editorial team, which operates independently from Built In’s other content teams, embraces industry-leading journalistic standards and best practices for all of the stories that we choose to pursue. Editors maintain complete control of all editorial content, including publishing date and status; headline and promotional copy; article text and hyperlinks; and all accompanying art, photography and other multimedia elements.\n\nTypes of editorial content you’ll find on BuiltIn.com and across our market sites includes but is not limited to:\n\nExpert Contributor Content\n\nBuilt In’s expert contributor program publishes thoughtful, solutions-oriented stories, commentary and dispatches written by innovative tech professionals in the trenches at businesses — from local startups to multinational corporations — across the nation. This detailed, insider section aims to inform and entertain an engaged tech audience by combining competitive insights with artful storytelling. It aspires to be the industry’s definitive destination for sharing compelling, first-person stories about overcoming challenges on the road to innovation.\n\nContributors to this section are selected by our editors. Expert columns are labeled with a badge indicating the author is a member of the Built In Expert Contributor Network.\n\nFeatures, Guides & Explainers\n\nBuilt In’s features, guides and explainers seek to tell compelling stories about technology and the workplace through original reporting. Our features range from big-picture overviews of industry and workplace trends, to deep dives into specific technologies, tools and best practices. Some of our features are written for tech professionals within a specialization or industry while others are written with a broader audience in mind. What all our features have in common is that they seek to help our readers become more informed and better at what they do. Built In’s features, guides and explainers do not carry any specific labeling on our sites.\n\nNews & Local Coverage\n\nBuilt In’s news coverage focuses on funding announcements, new office openings, product launches, IPOs and other trending stories in major tech hubs across the U.S. The aim of our news reporting is to consistently deliver engaging, timely and accurate information that keeps our audience up to date on the innovative companies and thought leaders worth knowing in every city and region we cover. Stories and sources are selected by our reporters and editors. Some of our news coverage is produced with the help of generative AI. These stories are clearly labeled and always fact checked and edited by a member of our editorial staff.\n\nContent Newsletters\n\nBuilt In regularly sends a curated content newsletter that is designed to provide a selection of high-quality, engaging stories to our users based on location and area/s of expertise. As a subscriber, you will not see everything we publish; you’ll only see the stories we feel are most relevant to you and your work. All of the stories included in Built In’s newsletters are produced by one of our in-house content teams.\n\nBrand Studio\n\nThrough Brand Studio’s branded content, employers work with Brand Studio writers and editors to highlight their culture, values and job openings to potential candidates. Employers who have purchased the content below can opt into stories and manage their participation through our Content Studio product. Built In’s Brand Studio maintains editorial control and decides publishing date and status, headline, text, company placement and photography.\n\nStories produced by this team are labeled with a Brand Studio badge. Story types produced by Brand Studio include:\n\nEmployer Roundups\n\nEmployer Roundups are list-format articles positioning companies among other employers of choice. Each story features multiple Q&As from companies specific to a Built In market/site surrounding a specific topic (e.g. “How These Chicago Engineering Teams Avoid Burnout” or “Top NYC Companies Hiring in May”). Paid inclusion is designated by a “Brand Studio” badge.\n\nEmployer Snapshots\n\nEmployer Snapshots are Q&A-style articles dedicated to one company, focusing on one key employee. Companies select topics from as list of options provided by Brand Studio. These stories are approximately 750 words, but can be longer.\n\nInsider Spotlights\n\nInsider Spotlights are feature-length articles including insights from one to three employees from one company. Usually in fully narrative form, these in-depth, long-form stories are sometimes broken into segments, and include multiple photos and rich elements like sidebars and pull quotes.\n\nInsider Videos\n\nThese documentary-style videos (can be onsite or virtual) capture an employer’s company culture through a behind-the-scenes look at the employees who work there.",
      "# [Dell's New XPS Lineup: Futuristic Design, with Built-in AI by Dell Technologies on 2024-01-04](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dells-new-xps-lineup-futuristic-design-with-built-in-ai-302025638.html)\nThis bold design has forever changed the ID of the XPS brand. Now, we are unifying the design across our XPS portfolio, introducing new screen sizes with the XPS 16 and XPS 14 and revamping the XPS 13 Plus to XPS 13. This trio of laptops share elements that eliminate distractions and place the focus on productivity.\n\nThe new XPS designs take a minimalistic approach that elevates the brand. The portfolio is made of CNC machined aluminum and Gorilla Glass 3, and tone-on-tone colors (available in Graphite and Platinum). The striking, unconventional look has key components that amplify the laptop experience. They feature a touch function row to switch between media and function keys easily, a seamless glass touchpad with haptic feedback and larger keycaps that provide a comfortable and smooth typing experience with every keystroke.\n\nStyle Meets Performance\n\nEach new XPS laptop features InfinityEdge panels with OLED touch options, variable refresh rates, high-resolution options, stunning color and Dolby Vision® for rich detail. The new portfolio boasts an exceptional audio experience starting with a quad speaker design, support for Dolby Atmos® immersive audio and 3D stereo surround from MaxxAudio® Pro by Waves. Plus, the new intelligent FHD 1080p webcam provides crystal clear video calls.\n\nThe lineup also brings new AI-enabled features, with AI acceleration built into the device thanks to Intel Core Ultra processors and experiences brought to life by Windows 11. These experiences enhance creativity and productivity while also providing better performance and longer battery life.1 (If this sounds too good to be true, read more about the efficiencies created from on-device AI here.) And speaking of battery life, all XPS laptops feature ExpressCharge to recharge 80% of battery life in just 60 minutes, so you can keep your creative flow going.\n\nIntroducing the New XPS Portfolio\n\nDell pioneered the art of engineering narrow bezels to minimize the device's footprint and maximize screen size. Now you can say hello to our new immersive 16- and 14-inch screens. The new XPS 16 and XPS 14 bring more portability to our XPS laptops and place the focus on performance and design.\n\nThe XPS 16 is the frontrunner of the portfolio, with supercharged performance for complex workloads. Featuring the latest Intel Core Ultra processors and NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs (up to the GeForce RTX 4070 GPU), the XPS 16 is our most powerful XPS laptop with up to 80W of sustained performance. Whether editing videos or testing the latest AI software, it's ideal for those running demanding apps, providing a smooth and fast experience.\n\nCombining performance, design and portability, the XPS 14 is a great option for those who need the freedom of working from anywhere. The XPS 14 is 21% lighter than the XPS 162 but still delivers powerful performance to complete challenging tasks with ease. With optional NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs (up to the GeForce RTX 4050 GPU), you can edit and play high-resolution videos effortlessly. And with long battery life, it's a refined laptop made to move with you.\n\nBoth XPS 16 and XPS 14 are NVIDIA Studio-validated systems, 3 meaning they deliver industry-leading performance for demanding creative tasks such as 3D rendering, video editing and live streaming, while offering exclusive access to the Studio AI-powered suite of tools and enhanced stability with NVIDIA Studio Drivers.\n\nXPS 13 started our design revolution and set our vision of the future with its iconic design. Starting at just 2.6 pounds, it's our thinnest and lightest XPS, so you can carry the device wherever you're headed. The renewed laptop has three new display options to choose from (including FHD+, QHD+ touch and 3K+ OLED touch) to provide you with a versatile visual experience, suitable for everyday productivity to high-resolution content creation. The XPS 13 is the ideal multitasking machine to balance school, work, personal projects or entertainment.\n\nXPS 16, XPS 14, XPS 13 Fact Sheet and Spec Sheet\n\nAI, Your New Best Friend\n\nAI and generative AI (GenAI) are driving the latest wave of innovation and unlocking new possibilities on the PC. It's exciting to see PCs built with AI acceleration into the device—something we touched on earlier, but let's take this a step further.\n\nThe new XPS portfolio, powered by Intel Core Ultra processors, features a built-in AI acceleration engine with the addition of a neural processing unit (NPU). This means the PC no longer needs to rely solely on the CPU or GPU for processing and performance. Imagine you are a creator who is always on the go and editing photos in Adobe Lightroom. The addition of the NPU automatically leverages the right compute engine for your workload—in this case letting you edit images faster than before while preserving battery life.\n\nThe laptops all come with Copilot in Windows 11, harnessing the capabilities of AI to make the things you do every day easier, faster and effortless. The portfolio also features a Copilot key designed to make it even easier to get things done and stay in the flow of work.

      "# [Samsung debuts Galaxy S24 smartphones with built-in AI tools by Elizabeth Napolitano on 2024-01-17](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s24-smartphone-ai-tools/)\nSamsung on Wednesday unveiled its latest lineup of Galaxy smartphones featuring a suite of baked-in AI tools, as it aims to widen the appeal of its Android devices and win back its spot as the world's biggest phone seller from Apple.\n\nThe company debuted the devices during its annual product launch in San Jose, California, emphasizing the new AI integrations, including smart translation and interpretation services and in-app image searches. The focus on AI marks a shift in the tech giant's previous hardware-heavy approach to developing and marketing its smartphones.\n\nThe next-generation lineup includes three phones:\n\nThe Galaxy S24, which retails for $799.99\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Plus, which costs $999.99\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is priced at $1,299.99\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra's price represents a price hike of $100, or an 8% increase, from last year's comparable model. The increase mirrors what Apple did with its fanciest model, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, released in September.\n\nCustomers can preorder the devices starting Wednesday. The new phones will begin shipping on January 31.\n\nHere's what to expect from Samsung's next-generation Galaxy smartphones.\n\nLive foreign language interpretations\n\nThe new phone will allow users to access a function that enables foreign language interpretation during calls. The feature will support 13 languages and 17 dialects, and it will be accessible for calls to and from any type of smartphones as well as landlines.\n\nThe feature saves users' preferred language settings, in addition to collecting data on which languages are used on each of the users' phone calls.\n\nIn-app image searches\n\nGoogle will offer \"Circle To Search\" on the newest Galaxy smartphones, allowing users to circle snippets of text, parts of photos or videos to get instant search results about whatever has been highlighted.\n\nThe new Galaxy phones will also enable quick and easy ways to manipulate the appearance and placement of specific parts of pictures taken on the devices' camera. It's a feature that could help people refine their photos, but could also make it easier to create misleading images.\n\nAI-powered photo editing tools\n\nThe new smartphones will come with a range of AI-powered photo editing tools. With the generative edit tool, users can erase or modify the position of objects in their images, in addition to filling in images' borders to correct a crooked photo frame.\n\nGalaxy's AI will also offer an edit suggestion option, allowing users to receive automated feedback on how to optimize and tweak their photos.\n\nHow does this compare with Apple's iPhones?\n\nApple is expected to put more AI into its next generation of iPhones in September, but now Samsung has a head start toward gaining the upper hand in making the technology more ubiquitous, Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson said.\n\nIt's a competitive edge that Samsung could use, having ceded its longstanding mantle as the world's largest seller of smartphones to Apple last year, according to the market research firm International Data Corp.\n\n\"Samsung's marketing challenge is precisely to make the technology transparent to impress consumers with magic and invisible experiences,\" Husson said.\n\n—With reporting by the Associated Press.",

      "# [14 Dangers of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by Mike Thomas on 2023-02-08](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/risks-of-artificial-intelligence)\nAs AI grows more sophisticated and widespread, the voices warning against the potential dangers of artificial intelligence grow louder.\n\n“These things could get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over, and we need to worry now about how we prevent that happening,” said Geoffrey Hinton, known as the “Godfather of AI” for his foundational work on machine learning and neural network algorithms. In 2023, Hinton left his position at Google so that he could “talk about the dangers of AI,” noting a part of him even regrets his life’s work.\n\nThe renowned computer scientist isn’t alone in his concerns.\n\nTesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, along with over 1,000 other tech leaders, urged in a 2023 open letter to put a pause on large AI experiments, citing that the technology can “pose profound risks to society and humanity.”\n\nWhether it’s the increasing automation of certain jobs, gender and racially biased algorithms or autonomous weapons that operate without human oversight (to name just a few), unease abounds on a number of fronts. And we’re still in the very early stages of what AI is really capable of.\n\n14 Dangers of AI\n\nQuestions about who’s developing AI and for what purposes make it all the more essential to understand its potential downsides. Below we take a closer look at the possible dangers of artificial intelligence and explore how to manage its risks.\n\n1. Lack of AI Transparency and Explainability\n\nAI and deep learning models can be difficult to understand, even for those who work directly with the technology. This leads to a lack of transparency for how and why AI comes to its conclusions, creating a lack of explanation for what data AI algorithms use, or why they may make biased or unsafe decisions. These concerns have given rise to the use of explainable AI, but there’s still a long way before transparent AI systems become common practice.\n\nTo make matters worse, AI companies continue to remain tight-lipped about their products. Former employees of OpenAI and Google DeepMind have accused both companies of concealing the potential dangers of their AI tools. This secrecy leaves the general public unaware of possible threats and makes it difficult for lawmakers to take proactive measures ensuring AI is developed responsibly.\n\n2. Job Losses Due to AI Automation\n\nAI-powered job automation is a pressing concern as the technology is adopted in industries like marketing, manufacturing and healthcare. By 2030, tasks that account for up to 30 percent of hours currently being worked in the U.S. economy could be automated — with Black and Hispanic employees left especially vulnerable to the change — according to McKinsey. Goldman Sachs even states 300 million full-time jobs could be lost to AI automation.\n\n“The reason we have a low unemployment rate, which doesn’t actually capture people that aren’t looking for work, is largely that lower-wage service sector jobs have been pretty robustly created by this economy,” futurist Martin Ford told Built In. With AI on the rise, though, “I don’t think that’s going to continue.”\n\nAs AI robots become smarter and more dexterous, the same tasks will require fewer humans. And while AI is estimated to create 97 million new jobs by 2025, many employees won’t have the skills needed for these technical roles and could get left behind if companies don’t upskill their workforces.\n\n“If you’re flipping burgers at McDonald’s and more automation comes in, is one of these new jobs going to be a good match for you?” Ford said. “Or is it likely that the new job requires lots of education or training or maybe even intrinsic talents — really strong interpersonal skills or creativity — that you might not have? Because those are the things that, at least so far, computers are not very good at.”\n\nAs technology strategist Chris Messina has pointed out, fields like law and accounting are primed for an AI takeover as well. In fact, Messina said, some of them may well be decimated. AI already is having a significant impact on medicine. Law and accounting are next, Messina said, the former being poised for “a massive shakeup.”\n\n“It’s a lot of attorneys reading through a lot of information — hundreds or thousands of pages of data and documents. It’s really easy to miss things,” Messina said. “So AI that has the ability to comb through and comprehensively deliver the best possible contract for the outcome you’re trying to achieve is probably going to replace a lot of corporate attorneys.”\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceAI Copywriting: Why Writing Jobs Are Safe\n\n3. Social Manipulation Through AI Algorithms\n\nSocial manipulation also stands as a danger of artificial intelligence. This fear has become a reality as politicians rely on platforms to promote their viewpoints, with one example being Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., wielding a TikTok troll army to capture the votes of younger Filipinos during the Philippines’ 2022 election.\n\nTikTok, which is just one example of a social media platform that relies on AI algorithms, fills a user’s feed with content related to previous media they’ve viewed on the platform. Criticism of the app targets this process and the algorithm’s failure to filter out harmful and inaccurate content, raising concerns over TikTok’s ability to protect its users from misleading information.\n\nOnline media and news have become even murkier in light of AI-generated images and videos, AI voice changers as well as deepfakes infiltrating political and social spheres. These technologies make it easy to create realistic photos, videos, audio clips or replace the image of one figure with another in an existing picture or video. As a result, bad actors have another avenue for sharing misinformation and war propaganda, creating a nightmare scenario where it can be nearly impossible to distinguish between credible and faulty news.\n\n“No one knows what’s real and what’s not,” Ford said. “You literally cannot believe your own eyes and ears; you can’t rely on what, historically, we’ve considered to be the best possible evidence ... That’s going to be a huge issue.”\n\n4. Social Surveillance With AI Technology\n\nIn addition to its more existential threat, Ford is focused on the way AI will adversely affect privacy and security. A prime example is China’s use of facial recognition technology in offices, schools and other venues. Besides tracking a person’s movements, the Chinese government may be able to gather enough data to monitor a person’s activities, relationships and political views.\n\nAnother example is U.S. police departments embracing predictive policing algorithms to anticipate where crimes will occur. The problem is that these algorithms are influenced by arrest rates, which disproportionately impact Black communities. Police departments then double down on these communities, leading to over-policing and questions over whether self-proclaimed democracies can resist turning AI into an authoritarian weapon.\n\n“Authoritarian regimes use or are going to use it,” Ford said. “The question is, ‘How much does it invade Western countries, democracies, and what constraints do we put on it?’”\n\nRelatedAre Police Robots the Future of Law Enforcement?\n\n5. Lack of Data Privacy Using AI Tools\n\nA 2024 AvePoint survey found that the top concern among companies is data privacy and security. And businesses may have good reason to be hesitant, considering the large amounts of data concentrated in AI tools and the lack of regulation regarding this information.\n\nAI systems often collect personal data to customize user experiences or to help train the AI models you’re using (especially if the AI tool is free). Data may not even be considered secure from other users when given to an AI system, as one bug incident that occurred with ChatGPT in 2023 “allowed some users to see titles from another active user’s chat history.” While there are laws present to protect personal information in some cases in the United States, there is no explicit federal law that protects citizens from data privacy harm caused by AI.\n\nRelated ReadingAI-Generated Content and Copyright Law: What We Know\n\n6. Biases Due to AI\n\nVarious forms of AI bias are detrimental too. Speaking to the New York Times, Princeton computer science professor Olga Russakovsky said AI bias goes well beyond gender and race. In addition to data and algorithmic bias (the latter of which can “amplify” the former), AI is developed by humans — and humans are inherently biased.\n\n“A.I. researchers are primarily people who are male, who come from certain racial demographics, who grew up in high socioeconomic areas, primarily people without disabilities,” Russakovsky said. “We’re a fairly homogeneous population, so it’s a challenge to think broadly about world issues.”\n\nThe narrow views of individuals have culminated in an AI industry that leaves out a range of perspectives. According to UNESCO, only 100 of the world’s 7,000 natural languages have been used to train top chatbots. It doesn’t help that 90 percent of online higher education materials are already produced by European Union and North American countries, further restricting AI’s training data to mostly Western sources.\n\nThe limited experiences of AI creators may explain why speech-recognition AI often fails to understand certain dialects and accents, or why companies fail to consider the consequences of a chatbot impersonating historical figures. If businesses and legislators don’t exercise greater care to avoid recreating powerful prejudices, AI biases could spread beyond corporate contexts and exacerbate societal issues like housing discrimination.\n\n7. Socioeconomic Inequality as a Result of AI\n\nIf companies refuse to acknowledge the inherent biases baked into AI algorithms, they may compromise their DEI initiatives through AI-powered recruiting. The idea that AI can measure the traits of a candidate through facial and voice analyses is still tainted by racial biases, reproducing the same discriminatory hiring practices businesses claim to be eliminating.\n\nWidening socioeconomic inequality sparked by AI-driven job loss is another cause for concern, revealing the class biases of how AI is applied. Workers who perform more manual, repetitive tasks have experienced wage declines as high as 70 percent because of automation, with office and desk workers remaining largely untouched in AI’s early stages. However, the increase in generative AI use is already affecting office jobs, making for a wide range of roles that may be more vulnerable to wage or job loss than others.\n\n8. Weakening Ethics and Goodwill Because of AI\n\nAlong with technologists, journalists and political figures, even religious leaders are sounding the alarm on AI’s potential pitfalls. In a 2023 Vatican meeting and in his message for the 2024 World Day of Peace, Pope Francis called for nations to create and adopt a binding international treaty that regulates the development and use of AI.\n\nPope Francis warned against AI’s ability to be misused, and “create statements that at first glance appear plausible but are unfounded or betray biases.” He stressed how this could bolster campaigns of disinformation, distrust in communications media, interference in elections and more — ultimately increasing the risk of “fueling conflicts and hindering peace.”\n\nThe rapid rise of generative AI tools gives these concerns more substance. Many users have applied the technology to get out of writing assignments, threatening academic integrity and creativity. Plus, biased AI could be used to determine whether an individual is suitable for a job, mortgage, social assistance or political asylum, producing possible injustices and discrimination, noted Pope Francis.\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceWhat Are AI Ethics?\n\n9. Autonomous Weapons Powered By AI\n\nAs is too often the case, technological advancements have been harnessed for warfare. When it comes to AI, some are keen to do something about it before it’s too late: In a 2016 open letter, over 30,000 individuals, including AI and robotics researchers, pushed back against the investment in AI-fueled autonomous weapons.\n\n“The key question for humanity today is whether to start a global AI arms race or to prevent it from starting,” they wrote. “If any major military power pushes ahead with AI weapon development, a global arms race is virtually inevitable, and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious: autonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow.”\n\nThis prediction has come to fruition in the form of Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems, which locate and destroy targets on their own while abiding by few regulations. Because of the proliferation of potent and complex weapons, some of the world’s most powerful nations have given in to anxieties and contributed to a tech cold war.\n\nMany of these new weapons pose major risks to civilians on the ground, but the danger becomes amplified when autonomous weapons fall into the wrong hands. Hackers have mastered various types of cyber attacks, so it’s not hard to imagine a malicious actor infiltrating autonomous weapons and instigating absolute armageddon.\n\nIf political rivalries and warmongering tendencies are not kept in check, artificial intelligence could end up being applied with the worst intentions. Some fear that, no matter how many powerful figures point out the dangers of artificial intelligence, we’re going to keep pushing the envelope with it if there’s money to be made.\n\n“The mentality is, ‘If we can do it, we should try it; let’s see what happens,” Messina said. “‘And if we can make money off it, we’ll do a whole bunch of it.’ But that’s not unique to technology. That’s been happening forever.’”\n\n10. Financial Crises Brought About By AI Algorithms\n\nThe financial industry has become more receptive to AI technology’s involvement in everyday finance and trading processes. As a result, algorithmic trading could be responsible for our next major financial crisis in the markets.\n\nWhile AI algorithms aren’t clouded by human judgment or emotions, they also don’t take into account contexts, the interconnectedness of markets and factors like human trust and fear. These algorithms then make thousands of trades at a blistering pace with the goal of selling a few seconds later for small profits. Selling off thousands of trades could scare investors into doing the same thing, leading to sudden crashes and extreme market volatility.\n\nInstances like the 2010 Flash Crash and the Knight Capital Flash Crash serve as reminders of what could happen when trade-happy algorithms go berserk, regardless of whether rapid and massive trading is intentional.\n\nThis isn’t to say that AI has nothing to offer to the finance world. In fact, AI algorithms can help investors make smarter and more informed decisions on the market. But finance organizations need to make sure they understand their AI algorithms and how those algorithms make decisions. Companies should consider whether AI raises or lowers their confidence before introducing the technology to avoid stoking fears among investors and creating financial chaos.\n\n11. Loss of Human Influence\n\nAn overreliance on AI technology could result in the loss of human influence — and a lack in human functioning — in some parts of society. Using AI in healthcare could result in reduced human empathy and reasoning, for instance. And applying generative AI for creative endeavors could diminish human creativity and emotional expression. Interacting with AI systems too much could even cause reduced peer communication and social skills. So while AI can be very helpful for automating daily tasks, some question if it might hold back overall human intelligence, abilities and need for community.\n\n12. Uncontrollable Self-Aware AI\n\nThere also comes a worry that AI will progress in intelligence so rapidly that it will become sentient, and act beyond humans’ control — possibly in a malicious manner. Alleged reports of this sentience have already been occurring, with one popular account being from a former Google engineer who stated the AI chatbot LaMDA was sentient and speaking to him just as a person would. As AI’s next big milestones involve making systems with artificial general intelligence, and eventually artificial superintelligence, cries to completely stop these developments continue to rise.\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceWhat Is the Eliza Effect?\n\n13. Increased Criminal Activity\n\nAs AI technology has become more accessible, the number of people using it for criminal activity has risen. Online predators can now generate images of children, making it difficult for law enforcement to determine actual cases of child abuse. And even in cases where children aren’t physically harmed, the use of children’s faces in AI-generated images presents new challenges for protecting children’s online privacy and digital safety.\n\nVoice cloning has also become an issue, with criminals leveraging AI-generated voices to impersonate other people and commit phone scams. These examples merely scratch the surface of AI’s capabilities, so it will only become harder for local and national government agencies to adjust and keep the public informed of the latest AI-driven threats.\n\n14. Broader Economic and Political Instability\n\nOverinvesting in a specific material or sector can put economies in a precarious position. Like steel, AI could run the risk of drawing so much attention and financial resources that governments fail to develop other technologies and industries. Plus, overproducing AI technology could result in dumping the excess materials, which could potentially fall into the hands of hackers and other malicious actors.\n\nHow to Mitigate the Risks of AI\n\nAI still has numerous benefits, like organizing health data and powering self-driving cars. To get the most out of this promising technology, though, some argue that plenty of regulation is necessary.\n\n“There’s a serious danger that we’ll get [AI systems] smarter than us fairly soon and that these things might get bad motives and take control,” Hinton told NPR. “This isn’t just a science fiction problem. This is a serious problem that’s probably going to arrive fairly soon, and politicians need to be thinking about what to do about it now.”\n\nDevelop Legal Regulations\n\nAI regulation has been a main focus for dozens of countries, and now the U.S. and European Union are creating more clear-cut measures to manage the rising sophistication of artificial intelligence. In fact, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) published the AI Bill of Rights in 2022, a document outlining to help responsibly guide AI use and development. Additionally, President Joe Biden issued an executive order in 2023 requiring federal agencies to develop new rules and guidelines for AI safety and security.\n\nAlthough legal regulations mean certain AI technologies could eventually be banned, it doesn’t prevent societies from exploring the field.\n\nFord argues that AI is essential for countries looking to innovate and keep up with the rest of the world.\n\n“You regulate the way AI is used, but you don’t hold back progress in basic technology. I think that would be wrong-headed and potentially dangerous,” Ford said. “We decide where we want AI and where we don’t; where it’s acceptable and where it’s not. And different countries are going to make different choices.”\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceWill This Election Year Be a Turning Point for AI Regulation?\n\nEstablish Organizational AI Standards and Discussions\n\nOn a company level, there are many steps businesses can take when integrating AI into their operations. Organizations can develop processes for monitoring algorithms, compiling high-quality data and explaining the findings of AI algorithms. Leaders could even make AI a part of their company culture and routine business discussions, establishing standards to determine acceptable AI technologies.\n\nGuide Tech With Humanities Perspectives\n\nThough when it comes to society as a whole, there should be a greater push for tech to embrace the diverse perspectives of the humanities. Stanford University AI researchers Fei-Fei Li and John Etchemendy make this argument in a 2019 blog post that calls for national and global leadership in regulating artificial intelligence:\n\n“The creators of AI must seek the insights, experiences and concerns of people across ethnicities, genders, cultures and socio-economic groups, as well as those from other fields, such as economics, law, medicine, philosophy, history, sociology, communications, human-computer-interaction, psychology, and Science and Technology Studies (STS).”\n\nBalancing high-tech innovation with human-centered thinking is an ideal method for producing responsible AI technology and ensuring the future of AI remains hopeful for the next generation. The dangers of artificial intelligence should always be a topic of discussion, so leaders can figure out ways to wield the technology for noble purposes.\n\n“I think we can talk about all these risks, and they’re very real,” Ford said. “But AI is also going to be the most important tool in our toolbox for solving the biggest challenges we face.”\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

      "# [Large data center to be built in BE on 2024-07-21](https://www.faribaultcountyregister.com/news/local-news/2024/07/21/large-data-center-to-be-built-in-be/)\nA new business is soon going to locate in Blue Earth and they will be a large consumer of electricity.\n\nAAIM Data Centers, headquartered in Delaware, will begin construction of one of their new data centers in Blue Earth very soon.\n\nThe data center will be located on Highway 169, between the new Blue Earth Light and Water substation and Cabin Coffee.\n\nThe building will be approximately 100 feet by 100 feet and will be filled with a lot of computer servers, according to AAIM’s chief executive officer (CEO) Anthony Levesque.\n\n“We expect to start construction very soon,” Levesque says. “It may be ambitious but we hope to get it done by September, or by the end of the year at the latest.”\n\nHe adds that they plan to use local contractors as much as they can on this project. That would be for ground work, building construction, electrical work and more.\n\nHe says his company chose to locate in Blue Earth because electricity is less expensive here, and because of the availability of space. He also mentioned the fact that Bevcomm has fiber optic high speed internet service here.\n\n“We also talked to Blue Earth officials at the city and at Blue Earth Light and Water and they were very receptive,” Levesque says. “It was incredible to see they were willing to work with us and fast track this project.”\n\nHe also calls it a win-win situation, for both his business and the local governments who will get taxes and for BELW who will furnish the electricity.\n\nThe CEO also says they will have some employees at the facility.\n\n“We have one open position to start,” Levesque explains. “In fact, we have that position posted online and I believe we are already conducting some interviews.”\n\nHe explained that the people they hire to be technicians do not need a lot of previous knowledge and do not necessarily need a degree from a university. They will be trained by the company for the work they need to do.\n\nLevesque says he and the company both want to have an open door policy when it comes to questions.\n\n“We want to be open about what we are doing,” he says. “People can send questions to us, or they can also contact Tim Stoner at Blue Earth Light and Water.”\n\nAAIM can be contacted by email at info@aaimdc.com or by phone at 573-935-7831.\n\nLevesque, who is from Montreal, Canada, says he is planning to be in Blue Earth around the end of July to check things out.\n\n“From Blue Earth Light and Water’s standpoint we are very excited about working together with AAIM on this project,” says Tim Stoner of BELW. “And the potential of additional business in the near future.”\n\n“I am excited that Blue Earth can welcome another business,” Blue Earth mayor Rick Scholtes says. “Because of the investments in infrastructure that our community has made we are able to accommodate economic growth and development.”",

      "# [A built-in pocket protector keeps sawfish from ‘sword fighting’ in the womb by ccrockett, Natalie van Hoose on 2024-05-30](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stops-sawfish-from-sword-fighting-womb)\nSmalltooth sawfish develop their signature, long, tooth-lined snout while still in the womb. The needle-sharp teeth are encased in a specialized sheath that prevents the rays from cutting up their mother and siblings during gestation and birth. Now, scientists have gotten their first close-up look at this built-in pocket protector.\n\n“It’s a cool thing Mother Nature figured out to protect mom from those calcified teeth and protect siblings from sword fighting in the uterus,” says fish biologist Gregg Poulakis of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission in Charlotte Harbor.\n\nObservations of baby sawfish and laboratory analysis of tissue samples have revealed that the sheath is a tough, multilayered “second skin” that sheds within about four days after birth, Poulakis and colleagues report May 28 in Fishery Bulletin. The finding overturns a long-held assumption that the sheath was a fragile, gelatinous membrane.\n\n“I think a lot of the descriptions historically are based on the fact that people have just seen them in pictures,” says Dean Grubbs, a fish ecologist at Florida State University’s Coastal and Marine Laboratory in St. Teresa who was not involved in the work. “It’s a significant structure … as you would expect it to be if it is going to essentially shield those really sharp points.”\n\nThe species, Pristis pectinata, is found primarily in waters off South Florida and the western Bahamas. The ray is so rare that it took Poulakis and colleagues 18 years of near-monthly research trips to collect a handful of sheath tissue samples.\n\nThe sheath feels like paraffin wax, Poulakis says: firm, but with a slight give. “You can’t peel it off.”\n\nA combination of histology, scanning electron microscopy, micro-CT and elemental analysis of the samples show the sheath has two tissue layers that resemble an epidermis and a dermis, as well as proteins that look like keratin, reticulin and collagen. This suggests the sheath is a second skin, but the researchers emphasize more work is needed to confirm that’s what they’re seeing.\n\nThe research provides more insight into the life history of the smalltooth sawfish, which is critically endangered due to habitat loss and accidental entanglement in fishing nets (SN: 6/5/15). Scientists had begun to be cautiously optimistic that smalltooth sawfish were on the brink of a comeback, Poulakis says. But that burgeoning recovery is now threatened by an ongoing, mysterious die-off in Florida’s Lower Keys. Dozens of sawfish have died, and Poulakis and others are racing to determine why.\n\n“It’s discouraging when something like this happens and makes us take a step or two back,” Poulakis says. “We’re taking a lot of samples that will help us learn about the species beyond this mortality event.”",
      "# [Instagram introduces mandatory 'Teen Accounts' with built-in limits, parental controls by Katie Kindelan, ABC News on 2024-09-17](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Family/instagram-introduces-teen-accounts/story?id=113734038)\nFor the first time in its history, Instagram on Tuesday announced the launch of accounts designed specifically for teenage users with built-in privacy protections.\n\nThe new accounts, called \"Teen Accounts,\" will be automatic for all Instagram users under the age of 18, both for teens already using the app and for those signing up.\n\nBy default, Instagram users younger than 16 will need a parent's permission to change their account settings.\n\nThe changes -- expected to impact tens of millions of users -- were announced by Instagram head Adam Mosseri in a live interview on \"Good Morning America.\"\n\n\"They're an automatic set of protections for teens that try to proactively address the top concerns that we've heard from parents about teens online,\" Mosseri said on \"GMA.\" \"Things like who can contact them, what content they see and how much time they spend on their device ... all without requiring any involvement from the parent.\"\n\nMosseri said the rollout of Teen Accounts starts Tuesday with new users signing up for the app, while existing teen users will see their accounts switch to the new Teen Accounts model within 60 days.\n\nAmong the changes put in place by Instagram include a new privacy setting that, by default, places all teen users in private accounts. In order to switch to a public account, teens under age 16 will need a parent's permission.\n\nUnder the private account setting, teens will need to accept new followers and only people whom they accept as followers can see their content and interact with them.\n\nIn addition, teen users will now automatically only be able to message with people they follow, or are already connected to, and parents will have a new tool in their settings that allows them to see with whom their teen has recently been messaging.\n\nWith the new accounts, teens will have the power to choose the age-appropriate topics they want to see more of on Instagram, like sports or art, and parents will also be able to see the topics their teens choose.\n\nIn order to limit the amount of time spent on Instagram, all Teen Accounts will be placed in \"sleep mode\" between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., while parents can also adjust their child's time settings -- including limiting access completely overnight -- in the parental supervision tool.\n\nAnother change for Teen Accounts is that they will automatically be placed in more restrictive content settings, which will limit the content they see in search functions like Reels or Explore from accounts they don't follow, according to Instagram.\n\nMosseri said Instagram has protections in place to block teens from lying about their age, including requiring teens to verify their age if they try to change their birthday and not allowing new accounts with different birthdays from the same device.\n\nAntigone Davis, vice president and global head of safety for Meta, the parent company of Instagram, told \"GMA\" the company is also implementing new ways to verify users' ages.\n\n\"We are building technology to try to identify if you've lied about your age and then move you into those stricter settings,\" Davis said. \"This is a challenging area for industry, which is why, on top of building that technology that will try to identify age liars and put them into those protective settings, we also will have moments where, if we get a strong signal, we will ask you to age verify.\"\n\nDavis said that parents will be able to monitor their teens' account and adjust their settings from their own Instagram accounts.\n\n'The idea is to really make it simpler, so they [parents] have their own center that they can go and look and see what the privacy setting is for their teen,\" she said.\n\nChanges spurred by parents and teens\n\nThe changes for teen Instagram users come amid mounting evidence showing the dangers of social media for young users.\n\nSocial media use is linked with symptoms of depression and anxiety, body image issues, and lower life satisfaction for some teens and adolescents, research shows. Heavy social media use around the time adolescents go through puberty is linked with lower life satisfaction one year later, one large study found.\n\nU.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who previously issued an advisory highlighting a crisis in youth mental health, has said he believes being on social media \"does a disservice\" to kids early in their teen years. Noting the crisis among kids, the American Psychological Association last year issued the first guidance of its kind to help teens use social media safely.\n\nIn January, while testifying at a Senate hearing, Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, publicly apologized to parents, caregivers and loved ones of young people who they say were harmed due to social media use, telling them, \"It's terrible. No one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.\"\n\nIn his apology, Zuckerberg also emphasized Meta's efforts on safety, adding, \"This is why we invest so much and are going to continue doing industry-leading efforts to make sure that no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer.\"\n\nBoth Mosseri and Davis said the newly-announced changes to Instagram for teen users came after conversations with parents and teenagers around the world.\n\n\"I think we have a responsibility to make sure that Instagram is a safe place for teens to explore their interests and connect with their friends,\" Mosseri said. \"But this change is really focused not on any litigations, but on parental concerns.\"\n\nMosseri added that Instagram views parents as the company's \"north star.\"\n\n\"They've been clear and what they're most concerned about, and we're trying to proactively address those concerns without requiring their involvement,\" he said of parents. \"But if a parent wants to get involved, we've also built some robust tools to allow them to shape the experience into what's most appropriate for their teen, because at the end of the day, a parent always knows what's best for their child.\""
