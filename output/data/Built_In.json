      "# [Sales Industry Perspectives and Job Outlook](https://builtin.com/sales)\nWhat Is Sales?\n\nThe term “sales” usually encompasses any activities that assist in selling a product or service to a business or consumer. This term is intentionally broad and generalized. As with most industries today, sales is constantly growing and evolving in its scope and range. No longer are sales teams relying on cold calling for their next big sale. Today, salespeople learn skills, like marketing and data extrapolation, to target customers who are truly interested in their product or company. This method is proving to be much more efficient in forecasting and creating revenue for businesses, while being timesaving for salespeople.\n\nHow exactly does sales work? Every organization has its own method when it comes to selling. The sales branch of an organization is usually broken up into different teams that prospect, reach out to and converse with different groups of businesses (depending on the product and organizational structure). These teams can be grouped based on the size of the business they’re selling to (small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) or enterprises), the products they’re selling or even based on geographic region. No matter the case, sales teams are constantly meeting with customers either face-to-face (known as outside sales) or virtually through video or phone calls (referred to as inside sales) to build their sales pipelines.\n\nThe Sales Pipeline\n\nMost sales teams rely on sales pipelines to track the progress of their deals. The pipeline is essentially a set of stages that a prospect moves through on their journey to becoming a customer. The structure of a pipeline can differ from company to company, but they all track the same thing.\n\n1. Prospecting: The sales representative uses outside tools and digs deeper into a prospect’s background to determine if an individual or business had the need or budget to purchase what the salesperson is selling.\n\n2. Qualification: This is the step in which the salesperson determines if a prospect has the means to turn into a viable sales lead.\n\n3. Meeting: If determined to be a quality lead, a salesperson (or multiple salespeople) will reach out to the prospect to educate them on their products and meet with them to make business cases for why the prospect should purchase their product.\n\n4. Decision: The prospect either becomes a buyer or declines the offer. If they decide to buy, the sales team works tirelessly at identifying barriers that could potentially derail the deal: “Are any other competitors going to offer a better deal?” “Does the potential buyer have authority to make this purchase?” “Can this deal be thrown off by shifting priorities within the prospect’s organization?” These questions (and more) must be answered to get the sale across the finish line.\n\n5. Closing: The final terms are agreed to and the contract is signed. This is known as a “closed-won.”\n\nSales Skills\n\nWhat makes a great salesperson? Successful sales reps, engineers and managers are all highly-talented in both soft and hard skills. This means that high-performing salespeople have both “people skills” and the technical knowledge to provide a high value to potential customers. Below are just a few of many skills salespeople must have to be successful.\n\nRelationship Building\n\nA vital part of the whole sales process is building genuine relationships with customers. After all, you want to get to know who you’re working with and if their goals align with your products. Excelling at relationship building means you have superior active listening and conflict resolution abilities, as well as, the authentic ability to be empathetic towards a customer’s needs. This soft skill is vitally important in establishing the base of a fruitful relationship.\n\nProduct Knowledge\n\nLet’s face it, nobody is going to buy something from a person who doesn’t know the product they’re selling inside and out. Having the confidence to speak about your product, answer questions and dive into technical details will put a potential customer’s mind at ease. Knowing everything from pricing structure to how the product can fit into the customer’s roadmap will boost enthusiasm with prospects and turn more leads into sales.\n\nGoal-Oriented\n\nAll sales professionals must have a bit of a competitive drive in them so they can reach goals and drive revenue for their team. Successful salespeople establish themselves by setting tough, but attainable goals that help keep them focused, collaborative and hungry. You can set individual personal growth goals, like “participate in a sales workshop” or “expand my network by attending two events a month.” Or, you can set data-driven goals like “increase my quarter-over-quarter revenue by 20 percent.”\n\nProblem-Solving\n\nSales is a constant game of problem-solving and critical thinking. In one day, a salesperson might ask, “how do I interpret this sales data?”or “why is my high-priority customer saying they aren’t renewing our services?” Sales teams tackle these tough questions on a daily basis. It’s up to individual sales reps and managers to think quickly to ensure that revenue or customer relationships aren’t sacrificed.\n\nBest Sales Jobs Hiring Immediately NationwideView the Top Sales Jobs Hiring Now\n\nGetting Into a Sales Role\n\nSales is a diverse field, full of professionals who are motivated, focused and goal-oriented. The sector is diverse in job titles, responsibilities, specialties and career paths. It’s safe to say that there isn’t one way to get into sales, but past experience and a variety of both hard and soft skills will get you far.\n\nNowadays, most salespeople start out as sales development representatives and work their way up the ladder. These reps get a fantastic understanding of sales by researching quality leads, getting in touch with potential clients and preparing AEs for their sales pitches. SDRs are constantly digging into the data on CRMs, like Salesforce, or scouring other sources to find customers who are the right fit for a sales pitch. The outbound prospecting an SDR does is not only vital to the immediate success of a sales team, but to the SDR’s personal future in sales.\n\nIt’s also not unheard of for sales rookies to jump right into inside sales roles. Because the tech industry is booming, inside sales is actually the fastest-growing segment of the sales industry. Tech companies are always on the lookout for energetic and focused individuals who want to enhance their sales skills through this challenging position.\n\nNo matter what role you hop into in sales, it’s clear that in order to be successful, you have to sharpen your hard and soft skills. Not only do you need to keep up with the latest sales and marketing tools, but you have to also hone your abilities to come across as a “people person.” Having the ability to empathize with your prospect’s needs and then offer them a technical solution will take you far in the sales world.\n\nBest Sales Jobs Hiring Immediately NationwideView the Top Sales Jobs Hiring Now",
      "# [What Is Fintech? by Sam Daley on 2020-04-26](https://builtin.com/fintech)\nFintech, a combination of the words “financial” and “technology,” refers to software that seeks to make financial services and processes easier, faster and more secure. The fintech industry includes everything from payment processing solutions to mobile banking apps, all of which are designed to improve the financial lives of consumers and automate the financial operations of businesses.\n\nWhat Is Fintech?\n\nFintech, short for financial technology, is a term used to describe the integration of technology into a financial service or process, with the goal of enhancing or automating it.\n\nMore broadly, the term fintech also encompasses a rapidly growing industry that serves the interests of both consumers and businesses in multiple ways. From mobile banking and insurance to cryptocurrency and investment apps, fintech has a seemingly endless array of applications.\n\nWhat Is the Importance and Impact of Fintech?\n\nThe rapid digitization, automation and enhancement of financial services has led to greater convenience for consumers.\n\nFor instance, neobanks — banks that operate exclusively online — enable customers to complete actions like ordering credit cards and opening savings accounts online without charging the same fees as traditional institutions. Other fintech products, like digital wallets and peer-to-peer payment apps, have made it easy for people to simplify payment processes.\n\nFewer fees and online access have made fintech a viable alternative for communities that have been traditionally underserved by the finance industry. Over 90 percent of Hispanic consumers use some kind of fintech, followed by 88 percent of Black consumers and 79 percent of Asian consumers.\n\nBusinesses have also embraced fintech and contributed to its growth. Financial institutions provide 24/7 customer service with chatbots and robo-advisors, insurers use AI-driven fintech products to assess risk and offer accurate premiums and businesses connect to investors and other sources of capital through lending platforms.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2023, the number of fintech unicorns ballooned from 39 to 272, and the market capitalization of fintech companies doubled.\n\nHow Does Fintech Work?\n\nFintech works by simplifying financial processes for consumers and businesses. When it comes to fintech apps, this is typically done through application programming interfaces (APIs), which enable communication between two applications to facilitate data sharing. This makes it possible for fintech products to automate fund transfers, analyze spending data and perform other tasks.\n\nFintech apps can then leverage users’ data in different ways, depending on their purpose. Insurance apps can access policy details to provide personalized advice, banking apps can connect to checking accounts to send digital payments and personal finance apps can monitor credit histories to track financial health.\n\nIn addition to standalone apps, fintech companies partner with other organizations to provide embedded financial services. Embedded finance integrates financial services into non-financial apps. Take Apple Wallet, for example. Through the collaboration of Apple with different companies, iPhones store information like credit card details for users to access digitally.\n\nFintech Industry Overview\n\nThe global fintech market continues to show promise and is set to surpass $882 billion by 2030. However, there have been plenty of growing pains along the way, most notably the FTX crypto exchange scandal and the Silicon Valley Bank collapse. Amid recent tensions and fears, fintech funding has slowed. But there’s reason to believe a rebound is on the horizon.\n\nDespite setbacks in 2023, customer growth rates have exceeded 50 percent across various industries and regions within the global fintech industry. The prospect of further combining fintech with artificial intelligence has produced even more excitement, expanding the possibilities for what fintech could look like in the years to come.\n\nTypes of Fintech\n\nFintech is reshaping every aspect of the traditional finance industry, including the following areas.\n\nBanking\n\nMobile banking is the central focus of many fintech companies. In the world of personal finance, consumers have increasingly demanded easy access to their bank accounts, especially on a mobile device. Most major banks now offer some kind of mobile banking feature, especially with the rise of digital-first banks, or neobanks. Neobanks are essentially banks without any physical branch locations, serving customers with checking, savings, payment services and loans on completely mobile and digital infrastructure. Some banks also allow third-party software applications to access a user’s financial information, which is called open banking. Some examples of fintech banks or neobanks are Chime, Current, Aspiration and Varo.\n\nPayments\n\nMoving money around is something fintech is very good at. The phrase “I’ll Venmo you” or “I’ll CashApp you” is now a replacement for “I’ll pay you later.” These are, of course, go-to mobile payment platforms. Payment companies have changed the way we all do business. It’s easier than ever to send money digitally anywhere in the world. In addition to Venmo and Cash App, popular payment companies include Zelle, Paypal, Stripe and Square.\n\nE-Commerce\n\nConsumers can break up payments through a ‘buy now, pay later’ setup supported by companies like Klarna and Affirm. In this scenario, customers pay off products by making smaller, interest-free payments. On the business side, companies can compile purchasing data to understand their customers and send them targeted ads and deals.\n\nStock Trading\n\nFintech companies have made stock trading and investing more affordable. For example, Robinhood doesn’t charge fees for opening and maintaining brokerage accounts while Public.com lets investors purchase portions of shares — known as fractional shares — to avoid hefty stock prices. With AI’s ability to process massive amounts of data, investment tools can also track and organize trading data based on user requests. Users can then filter stocks based on their preferences for faster purchasing.\n\nWealth Management\n\nAutomation simplifies the investing process for less-experienced individuals. Many companies employ robo-advisors that provide recommendations and even select stocks after users answer questions about their financial interests and risk tolerance. If users prefer to build their own portfolios, robo-advisors can still analyze a user’s stocks to offer feedback on managing risk. Companies that provide robo-advisors and automated investing include Wealthfront, Stash and Acorns.\n\nFintech Lenders\n\nFintech is also overhauling credit by streamlining risk assessment, speeding up approval processes and making access easier. Billions of people around the world can now apply for a loan on their mobile devices, and new data points and risk modeling capabilities are expanding credit to underserved populations. Additionally, consumers can request credit reports multiple times a year without dinging their score, making the entire backend of the lending world more transparent for everyone. Within the fintech lending space, some companies worth noting include SoFi, Funding Circle and Prosper Marketplace.\n\nInsurtech\n\nInsurance is a somewhat slow adopter of technology, and many fintech startups are partnering with traditional insurance companies to help automate processes and expand coverage. From mobile car insurance to wearables for health insurance, the industry is staring down tons of innovation. Some insurtech companies to keep an eye on include Lemonade, Kin and NEXT Insurance.\n\nRegtech\n\nRegulation technology (regtech) tools track and analyze transactions to alert companies of suspicious online activities. Coordinating with regtech companies, institutions can then quickly identify issues and take steps to counteract fraud, cyber attacks and other problems. Regtech companies can also assess an institution’s data to determine the risk of failure and make relevant suggestions. Big names in this space include ComplyAdvantage, Forter and Chainalysis.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency and blockchain intersect with fintech in a number of ways. For starters, several crypto trading platforms have emerged that allow users to trade different kinds of cryptocurrencies and take advantage of decentralized exchanges. And to keep people’s digital currency safe, a number of crypto wallets have sprung up as well. In addition, several fintech companies use blockchain technology for payment processing, money transfer and secure digital identity management. Some examples of cryptocurrency fintech companies include Coinbase, Blockfi and Circle.\n\nFintech Company Examples\n\nHere are a few more examples of fintech companies improving upon traditional finance with the help of technology:\n\nIntuit automates the tax process with individual-based products like TurboTax and small business-based products like QuickBooks.\n\nShopify makes e-commerce more convenient for business owners with Magic, an AI assistant that can generate product photos, write product descriptions and more.\n\nWealthsimple simplifies the investment process with its robo-advisor, which gathers input from users to match them with diversified portfolios that meet their criteria.\n\nUpstart enhances the loan process by using AI to pair lenders with borrowers who satisfy their requirements while also helping borrowers secure low-cost, fixed-rate loans.\n\nClearcover speeds up the claims process with AI technology and introduces a generative AI tool to further improve the claims experience.\n\nOnfido builds trust between institutions and customers with its AI-driven platform, which uses biometrics, customer information and other data to prevent fraud.\n\nInteractions between fintech companies and traditional financial players will continue to evolve as fintech regulations adapt to the latest technologies and strategies.\n\nFintech Regulation\n\nThe U.S. fintech regulation ecosystem consists of both state and federal laws. While different entities help develop regulations, the main federal bodies are the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Other notable groups include the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Security and Exchanges Commission. Fintech companies must remain compliant with laws established by federal groups, as well as any laws in states where they operate.",
      "# [What Is Aerospace? Aerospace Industry & Engineering.](https://builtin.com/aerospace)\nWhat Is Aerospace Engineering?\n\nAerospace engineering is the branch of engineering that works in the design, development, testing and production of airborne objects such as aircraft, missiles, spacecraft, rocket propulsion systems and other related systems. Aerospace engineering can either fall into the categories of aeronautical engineering or astronautical engineering.\n\nHistory of Aerospace Engineering\n\nEarly aerospace engineering and its concepts can be traced back to the late 19th century. The true birth of the aerospace industry, however, took place in 1903, when Wilbur and Orville Wright demonstrated the first example of an airplane capable of sustained flight. The brothers conducted extensive research and development, which led to a breakthrough in developing an onboard system that would allow pilots to control the warping of the plane’s wings for altitude control. The Wright brothers began licensing their technology to governments and military contractors, and by 1909, they were able to develop the first plane capable of flying faster than 40 miles per hour.\n\nFast forward through several years of development — bolstered by the emergence of both World War I and World War II, plus the introduction of commercial airliners in the 1930s — and the aerospace industry would continue to take shape well into the 1950s. Along the way, superpowered jets were produced as well as missile defense systems that would further revolutionize combat. During the late 1950s, a new goal of reaching yet another frontier — space — became increasingly realistic.\n\nThe Space Age was marked by fierce competition between the Americans and the Soviets, both aspiring to become the first to explore beyond the sky. The Soviets were the first to succeed with the launch of a small satellite, Sputnik, first entering orbit in 1957. Sputnik’s achievement was a result of the evolution of missile systems and used rockets of similar construction to boost small payloads past the atmosphere. The United States completed its first successful launch in 1958 with Project SCORE, successfully placing the first low-orbit communications satellite into orbit.\n\nSeveral additional satellites were launched and followed by the launch of the first successful human-piloted spacecraft to enter orbit, accomplished by Yury A. Gagarin aboard the Soviet Union’s Vostok 1. Since Gagarin’s orbit, there have been hundreds of successful missions to space completed by both manned and autonomous aircraft.\n\nModern successes of the aerospace industry include manned missions to the moon, the exploration of Mars by rovers, an intricate system of navigational satellites launched into space and the permanent installation of an International Space Station in orbit.\n\nModern aerospace developments and breakthroughs often fall into one of two categories: Aeronautical Engineering and Astronautical Engineering.\n\nAerospace Engineering Fields\n\nEnabling flight both above and below the atmosphere requires the cooperation and collaboration of engineering experts across multiple fields. Organizations within these fields are responsible for designing systems that are both compatible with existing technology and sustainable enough to remain in use without the need for constant redesigns. These systems are designed through rigorous research and development and built around several key aerospace engineering concepts. By studying these concepts, aerospace engineers can choose the field that they would most like to specialize in and take on a role in some of the most critical jobs.\n\nAerodynamics\n\nAerodynamics refer to how air moves and the interaction between the air and any solid masses passing through it. This is the foundation of aerospace engineering and provides a baseline for sustained flight.\n\nThermodynamics\n\nThermodynamics is the science of the relationship between heat, temperature, energy and output. This concept is key to mechanical engineering as it defines how heat is transformed into energy and creates mechanical output.\n\nRead MoreWhat Is a Drone? Drone Definition and Uses.\n\nCelestial Mechanics\n\nCelestial mechanics applies principles of physics to astronomical objects, including stars, planets, asteroids, and other organic material in order to project the motion of objects throughout outer space. Astronautical engineering relies on celestial mechanics to propel engines and avoid contact with objects in orbit.\n\nFlight Mechanics\n\nThere are four forces that play into successful flight: thrust, drag, weight and lift. All of these forces must be balanced and react to changes in any of the other forces to sustain flight. Thrust is the result of propulsion and is controlled by engines, propellers, or rockets; drag slows a flying object down; weight is the effect gravity has on an object; and lift suspends flying objects in the air, often through the use of wings.\n\nPropulsion\n\nPropulsion is the use of a system to drive or push an object forward. Thrust is a result of propulsion, crucial to acceleration and maintaining speed in any craft.\n\nAcoustics\n\nAcoustics principles within aerospace are applied when evaluating and addressing aeroacoustic noise in spacecraft, launch environments, engines, and propulsion systems due to aerodynamic flow. Proper acoustics are crucial to maintaining a safe and manageable environment for those near a flying craft and require careful consideration due to changing pressures that can create catastrophic failure.\n\nGuidance and Control Systems\n\nAll aerospace engineering concepts come into play when designing guidance and control systems, allowing pilots and controllers to adjust systems as needed to maintain flight. Guidance and control systems also utilize GPS navigation to ensure safe travel through low visibility environments.\n\nBest Aerospace CompaniesView Top Aerospace Companies Hiring Now\n\nAerospace Engineering Skills\n\nAerospace engineers should possess a deep understanding of several elements crucial to success in any aerospace field.

      "# [Robotics: What Are Robots? by Sam Daley on 2019-04-12](https://builtin.com/robotics)\nRobotics is an interdisciplinary sector of science and engineering dedicated to the design, construction and use of mechanical robots. Our guide will give you a concrete grasp of robotics, including different types of robots and how they’re being applied across industries.\n\nWhat Is Robotics?\n\nRobotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that produces machines, called robots, that replicate or substitute for human actions. Robots perform basic and repetitive tasks with greater efficiency and accuracy than humans, making them ideal for industries like manufacturing. However, the introduction of artificial intelligence in robotics has given robots the ability to handle increasingly complex situations in various industries.\n\nWhat Is a Robot?\n\nA robot is a programmable machine that can complete a task, while the term robotics describes the field of study focused on developing robots and automation. Each robot has a different level of autonomy. These levels range from human-controlled bots that carry out tasks to fully-autonomous bots that perform tasks without any external influences.\n\nIn terms of etymology, the word ‘robot’ is derived from the Czech word robota, which means “forced labor.” The word first appeared in the 1920 play R.U.R., in reference to the play’s characters who were mass-produced workers incapable of creative thinking.\n\nRobotics Aspects\n\nMechanical Construction\n\nThe mechanical aspect of a robot helps it complete tasks in the environment for which it’s designed. For example, the Mars 2020 Rover’s wheels are individually motorized and made of titanium tubing that help it firmly grip the harsh terrain of the red planet.\n\nElectrical Components\n\nRobots need electrical components that control and power the machinery. Essentially, an electric current — a battery, for example — is needed to power a large majority of robots.\n\nSoftware Program\n\nRobots contain at least some level of computer programming. Without a set of code telling it what to do, a robot would just be another piece of simple machinery. Inserting a program into a robot gives it the ability to know when and how to carry out a task.\n\nWhat Are the Main Components of a Robot?\n\nControl System\n\nComputation includes all of the components that make up a robot’s central processing unit, often referred to as its control system. Control systems are programmed to tell a robot how to utilize its specific components, similar in some ways to how the human brain sends signals throughout the body, in order to complete a specific task. These robotic tasks could comprise anything from minimally invasive surgery to assembly line packing.\n\nSensors\n\nSensors provide a robot with stimuli in the form of electrical signals that are processed by the controller and allow the robot to interact with the outside world. Common sensors found within robots include video cameras that function as eyes, photoresistors that react to light and microphones that operate like ears. These sensors allow the robot to capture its surroundings and process the most logical conclusion based on the current moment and allows the controller to relay commands to the additional components.\n\nActuators\n\nA device can only be considered to be a robot if it has a movable frame or body. Actuators are the components that are responsible for this movement. These components are made up of motors that receive signals from the control system and move in tandem to carry out the movement necessary to complete the assigned task. Actuators can be made of a variety of materials, such as metal or elastic, and are commonly operated by use of compressed air (pneumatic actuators) or oil (hydraulic actuators) but come in a variety of formats to best fulfill their specialized roles.\n\nPower Supply\n\nLike the human body requires food in order to function, robots require power. Stationary robots, such as those found in a factory, may run on AC power through a wall outlet but more commonly, robots operate via an internal battery. Most robots utilize lead-acid batteries for their safe qualities and long shelf life while others may utilize the more compact but also more expensive silver-cadmium variety. Safety, weight, replaceability and lifecycle are all important factors to consider when designing a robot’s power supply.\n\nSome potential power sources for future robotic development also include pneumatic power from compressed gasses, solar power, hydraulic power, flywheel energy storage organic garbage through anaerobic digestion and nuclear power.\n\nEnd Effectors\n\nEnd effectors are the physical, typically external components that allow robots to finish carrying out their tasks. Robots in factories often have interchangeable tools like paint sprayers and drills, surgical robots may be equipped with scalpels and other kinds of robots can be built with gripping claws or even hands for tasks like deliveries, packing, bomb diffusion and much more.\n\nHow Do Robots Work?\n\nSome robots are pre-programmed to perform specific functions, meaning they operate in a controlled environment where they do simple, monotonous tasks — like a mechanical arm on an automotive assembly line.\n\nOther robots are autonomous, operating independently of human operators to carry out tasks in open environments. In order to work, they use sensors to perceive the world around them, and then employ decision-making structures (usually a computer) to take the optimal next step based on their data and mission.\n\nRobots may also work by using wireless networks to enable human control from a safe distance. These teleoperated robots usually work in extreme geographical conditions, weather and circumstances. Examples of teleoperated robots are the human-controlled submarines used to fix underwater pipe leaks during the BP oil spill or drones used to detect landmines on a battlefield.\n\nTypes of Robotics\n\nHumanoid Robots\n\nHumanoid robots are robots that look like or mimic human behavior. These robots usually perform human-like activities (like running, jumping and carrying objects), and are sometimes designed to look like us, even having human faces and expressions. Two of the most prominent examples of humanoid robots are Hanson Robotics’ Sophia and Boston Dynamics’ Atlas.\n\nCobots\n\nCobots, or collaborative robots, are robots designed to work alongside humans. These robots prioritize safety by using sensors to remain aware of their surroundings, executing slow movements and ceasing actions when their movements are obstructed. Cobots typically perform simple tasks, freeing up humans to address more complex work.\n\nIndustrial Robots\n\nIndustrial robots automate processes in manufacturing environments like factories and warehouses. Possessing at least one robotic arm, these robots are made to handle heavy objects while moving with speed and precision. As a result, industrial robots often work in assembly lines to boost productivity.\n\nMedical Robots\n\nMedical robots assist healthcare professionals in various scenarios and support the physical and mental health of humans. These robots rely on AI and sensors to navigate healthcare facilities, interact with humans and execute precise movements. Some medical robots can even converse with humans, encouraging people’s social and emotional growth.\n\nAgricultural Robots\n\nAgricultural robots handle repetitive and labor-intensive tasks, allowing farmers to use their time and energy more efficiently. These robots also operate in greenhouses, where they monitor crops and help with harvests. Agricultural robots come in many forms, ranging from autonomous tractors to drones that collect data for farmers to analyze.\n\nMicrorobotics\n\nMicrorobotics is the study and development of robots on a miniature scale. Often no bigger than a millimeter, microrobots can vary in size, depending on the situation. Biotech researchers typically use microrobotics to monitor and treat diseases, with the goal of improving diagnostic tools and creating more targeted solutions.\n\nAugmenting Robots\n\nAugmenting robots, also known as VR robots, either enhance current human capabilities or replace the capabilities a human may have lost. The field of robotics for human augmentation is a field where science fiction could become reality very soon, with bots that have the ability to redefine the definition of humanity by making humans faster and stronger. Some examples of current augmenting robots are robotic prosthetic limbs or exoskeletons used to lift hefty weights.\n\nSoftware Bots\n\nSoftware bots, or simply ‘bots,’ are computer programs which carry out tasks autonomously. They are not technically considered robots. One common use case of software robots is a chatbot, which is a computer program that simulates conversation both online and over the phone and is often used in customer service scenarios. Chatbots can either be simple services that answer questions with an automated response or more complex digital assistants that learn from user information.\n\nRobotics Applications\n\nBeginning as a major boon for manufacturers, robotics has become a mainstay technology for a growing number of industries.\n\nManufacturing\n\nIndustrial robots can assemble products, sort items, perform welds and paint objects. They may even be used to fix and maintain other machines in a factory or warehouse.\n\nHealthcare\n\nMedical robots transport medical supplies, perform surgical procedures and offer emotional support to those going through rehabilitation.\n\nCompanionship\n\nSocial robots can support children with learning disabilities and act as a therapeutic tool for people with dementia. They also have business applications like providing in-person customer service in hotels and moving products around warehouses.\n\nHome Use\n\nConsumers may be most familiar with the Roomba and other robot vacuum cleaners. However, other home robots include lawn-mowing robots and personal robot assistants that can play music, engage with children and help with household chores.\n\nSearch and Rescue\n\nSearch and rescue robots can save those stuck in flood waters, deliver supplies to those stranded in remote areas and put out fires when conditions become too extreme for firefighters.\n\nPros and Cons of Robotics\n\nRobotics comes with a number of benefits and drawbacks.\n\nPros of Robotics\n\nIncreased accuracy. Robots can perform movements and actions with greater precision and accuracy than humans.\n\nEnhanced productivity. Robots can work at a faster pace than humans and don’t get tired, leading to more consistent and higher-volume production.\n\nImproved safety. Robots can take on tasks and operate in environments unsafe for humans, protecting workers from injuries.\n\nRapid innovation. Many robots are equipped with sensors and cameras that collect data, so teams can quickly refine processes.\n\nGreater cost-efficiency. Gains in productivity may make robots a more cost-efficient option for businesses compared to hiring more human workers.\n\nCons of Robotics\n\nJob losses. Robotic process automation may put human employees out of work, especially those who don’t have the skills to adapt to a changing workplace.\n\nLimited creativity. Robots may not react well to unexpected situations since they don’t have the same problem-solving skills as humans.\n\nData security risks. Robots can be hit with cyber attacks, potentially exposing large amounts of data if they’re connected to the Internet of Things.\n\nMaintenance costs. Robots can be expensive to repair and maintain, and faulty equipment can lead to disruptions in production and revenue losses.\n\nEnvironmental waste. Extracting raw materials to build robots and having to discard disposable parts can lead to more environmental waste and pollution.\n\nFuture of Robotics\n\nThe evolution of AI has major implications for the future of robotics. In factories, AI can be combined with robotics to produce digital twins and design simulations to help companies improve their workflows. Advanced AI also gives robots increased autonomy. For example, drones could deliver packages to customers without any human intervention. In addition, robots could be outfitted with generative AI tools like ChatGPT, resulting in more complex human-robot conversations.\n\nAs robots’ intelligence has shifted, so too have their appearances. Humanoid robots are designed to visually appeal to humans in various settings while understanding and responding to emotions, carrying objects and navigating environments. With these forms and abilities, robots can become major contributors in customer service, manufacturing, logistics and healthcare, among other industries.\n\nWhile the spread of robotics has stoked fears over job losses due to automation, robots could simply change the nature of human jobs. Humans may find themselves collaborating with robots, letting their robotic counterparts handle repetitive tasks while they focus on more difficult problems. Either way, humans will need to adapt to the presence of robots as robotics continues to progress alongside other technologies like AI and deep learning.\n\nHistory of Robotics\n\nRobotics as a concept goes back to ancient times. The ancient Greeks combined automation and engineering to create the Antikythera, a handheld device that predicted eclipses. Centuries later, Leonardo Da Vinci designed a mechanical knight now known as “Leonardo’s Robot.” But it was the rise of manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution that highlighted the need for widespread automation.\n\nFollowing William Grey Walter’s development of the first autonomous robots in 1948, George Devol created the first industrial robotic arm known as Unimate. It began operating at a GM facility in 1959. In 1972, the Stanford Research Institute designed Shakey — the first AI-powered robot. Shakey used cameras and sensors to collect data from its surroundings and inform its next moves.\n\nThe ability of robots to perceive their surroundings led researchers to explore whether they could also perceive human emotions. In the late 1990s, MIT’s Dr. Cynthia Breazeal built Kismet, a robotic head that used facial features to express and respond to human emotions. This predecessor to social robots opened the door for future robots like Roomba and consumer-centric inventions like Alexa and other voice assistants.\n\nRobots took another leap forward in 2012 due to a breakthrough in deep learning. Armed with volumes of digital images, British AI expert Geoffrey Hinton and his team successfully trained a system of neural networks to sort over one million images while making few errors. Since then, companies have incorporated deep learning into their technologies, promising more possibilities for robotics.\n\n1700s\n\n(1737) Jacques de Vaucanson builds the first biomechanical automaton on record.

      "# [What Is Logistics? Logistics Definition and Examples.](https://builtin.com/logistics)\nWhat Is Logistics?\n\nLogistics is the process of coordinating how goods and products are obtained, stored and distributed. Manufacturers rely on logistics while overseeing complex operations in order to maintain efficiency, reduce costs and ensure that consumers’ needs are met.\n\nDue to the prominence of e-commerce companies, like Amazon, logistics embodies more than the actual movement of products from one place to another.\n\nLogistics Definition\n\nLogistics refers to the process of managing resources, including how they are transported, stored and received. Logistics often goes hand in hand with the global supply chain.\n\nAn important part of logistics is the steps taken in order to maximize customer satisfaction. This includes elements such as demand planning, order fulfillment, inventory management and customer service operations. These elements ensure that the goods consumers need are stocked and orders are fulfilled in a timely manner.\n\nLogistics management software has aided the expansion of what the logistics industry entails and how goods are brought to consumers. Some examples of software for the logistics industry include transportation management systems, enterprise resource planning software, yard management systems and warehouse management systems. The growth of this technology has created a need for specialized roles and companies focused on building and implementing logistics software.\n\nAs technology continues to transform our world, its influence on the logistics industry will only become greater, prompting a shift in how companies quickly and efficiently deliver their products to consumers.\n\nSupply Chain Management vs. Logistics\n\nSupply chain management and logistics are often thought of as one in the same, but the terms actually capture two distinct parts of what it means to move resources.\n\nSupply chain management is the larger network that connects global vendors, transportation companies, distributors and warehouses. This network functions as the framework that logistics works under.\n\nLogistics is the process companies undertake to deliver goods to consumers. This process involves purchasing and delivering materials, packaging and shipping goods as well as transporting goods and products to distributors.\n\nWhy Logistics Is Important\n\nLogistics may not be the first thing that comes to mind when a purchase is made online or in a brick-and-mortar store, but it is undeniably intertwined with everything we buy. Logistical considerations affect global supply chains, what items are in stock and when as well as where manufacturers chose to build their facilities. These influences are just one way that logistics displays importance in our global economy.\n\nUtilizing logistics properly is essential to the function of businesses across the globe — and effectively managed logistics typically leads to positive business outcomes. With the growing complexity of the global supply chain, properly implemented and managed logistics are more important than ever.\n\nThe importance of logistics also stretches to simplifying communication and reducing costs. Effective logistics help foster relationships between suppliers, shipping services and warehousers through automated systems. The connectivity of logistics improves delivery and fulfillment of orders, which in turn reduces overhead costs. Costs are also reduced by the ability to use logistical systems to purchase goods based on supply forecasts and improved inventory management.\n\nBest Logistics Companies Hiring for Open RolesView Top Logistics Companies Hiring Now\n\nTypes of Logistics\n\nThe logistics industry has transformed over the past century. During the 1960s, the supply chain was indelibly changed when IBM developed the world’s first computerized inventory management and forecasting system, which made it simpler to track orders, inventory and distribution. Since then, the industry has been propelled even further into the future, bringing with it an entirely new perspective on how we exchange goods across the globe.\n\nTypes of Logistics Companies\n\ne-Commerce logistics\n\nFreight logistics\n\nThird-party logistics\n\nCarrier logistics\n\nFreight forwarders\n\nToday, the logistics realm is heavily influenced by AI and machine learning, which many logistics companies use to offer more accurate forecasting and enhanced order management. With these technological advances and more, the supply chain has been given the chance to prosper worldwide.\n\nLogistics in e-Commerce\n\nGiven the rise of e-commerce and the rapid growth of the online ordering space, logistics has become one of the world’s fastest-growing industries. Many organizations have emerged in response to logistics’ continuous transformation, dedicated to optimizing the supply chain in unimaginable ways. Perhaps the most well-known logistics leader to have emerged over the past few decades is e-commerce giant Amazon. While Amazon was initially founded as an online marketplace for books, the company has become a household name across the globe, altering the way in which products are transported and delivered to consumers.\n\nAmazon has become famous for its logistics strategy, which is made possible by the company’s global network of distribution, sortation and fulfillment centers. Amazon’s same-day and next-day delivery model rests on a complex logistics framework. Products are delivered to the company’s fulfillment centers before being moved to sortation centers. Once goods have made it through Amazon’s sortation centers, they are loaded onto a wide range of transportation modes, which can include the company’s own fleet of delivery trucks and airplanes.\n\nThird-Party Logistics\n\nAmazon has entirely redefined the logistics landscape, yet it’s not the only major third party logistics (3PL) provider making waves. Companies like UPS and FedEx have played a significant role in the transformation of logistics. These companies are capable of transporting goods from their point of origin, warehousing products and packaging them. Working with 3PL providers offers numerous advantages for both small and large businesses including the ability to obtain better rates, easily expand into new markets and improve customer service.\n\nLogistics in Freight Shipping\n\nWhile 3PL providers are capable of handling the entirety of a company’s supply chain operations, the different components of the logistics process can be carried out by individual players. For instance, freight companies solely handle the physical transportation of goods, while freight forwarders are dedicated to optimizing transport solutions and handling necessary documentation. In this sense, logistics could be seen as a complex web of moving parts, which operate in tandem with one another in order to boost efficiency and reduce costs within the supply chain.\n\nBy way of example, Flexport has developed an operating model designed to simplify global freight forwarding, while Transfix has created a marketplace that connects shippers with a national network of carriers.\n\nRead NextFragmented Tech Is the Way Forward in Hospitality\n\nLogistic Tech Developments\n\nGiven the logistics industry’s seemingly endless transformation, logistics management is naturally made up of many different elements. These components include the planning, procurement and coordination of manufacturing materials, strategizing the development of a product and reclaiming materials and supplies involved in the manufacturing of a product. For logistics managers, keeping track of the many different aspects of a supply chain can be nearly impossible. Luckily, logistics tech has successfully reshaped the industry, turning it into a robust sector fueled by the rise of innovative new technologies.\n\nTop Logistics Tech Companies\n\nFourKites\n\nproject44\n\nMotive\n\nZipline\n\nFlexport\n\nTransfix\n\nArrive Logistics\n\nAI and Optimization in Logistics\n\nAs the demand for online delivery grows and consumers’ expectations become larger, the need to optimize logistics has never been greater. As a result, software developers have set to work creating platforms designed to make the supply chain more manageable. Real-time visibility software providers such as FourKites, project44 and FreightVerify empower supply chain operators to simply identify issues and quickly resolve them, saving organizations huge amounts of time during which they can focus on other aspects of the logistics process. Likewise, fleet management company Motive has made it easier to track cargo and drivers while improving efficiency and safety along the supply chain.\n\nConsidering all of the work that goes into Amazon’s e-commerce services, it may come as no surprise that the company relies heavily on the latest technology in order to accomplish its consumer delivery goals. Amazon has been using AI to power its product recommendations for years. The company has also adopted machine learning to build the handheld virtual assistant, Amazon Echo.\n\nWarehouse Automation in Logistics\n\nAmazon doesn’t solely use technology to maximize the customer experience. In fact, the company’s technological expertise extends to its packaging and delivery services. The e-commerce company made headlines in 2012 when it introduced automation into its supply chain upon acquiring Kiva Systems. Today, Amazon’s warehouses are filled with thousands of robots built to optimize the picking and packing process.\n\nAmazon isn’t the only logistics leader that has unlocked the potential of robotics. In fact, the warehouse automation space has grown tremendously over the past several years and is expected to become increasingly more valuable over time. The growth of this sector is attributed largely to the steady rise of e-commerce, which has ignited the need to send products out quickly while lowering operating costs. The popularity of online grocery shopping in particular has bolstered the growth of warehouse automation, as online grocery retailers have been forced to meet consumers’ ever-increasing demands while competing with brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles in Logistics\n\nAs warehouse automation continues to infiltrate the logistics industry, autonomous vehicles are becoming a supply chain essential. For companies like Amazon, self-driving vehicles are not only profitable within the warehouse, as they harbor the potential to make on-road delivery faster and more efficient. Companies like Starship Technologies are developing revolutionary new ways to autonomously transport goods, thus unleashing new possibilities within the logistics realm.\n\nDrones in Logistics\n\nAlongside the emergence of autonomous vehicles, the commercial use of drones has opened up new avenues for supply chain management. Within a warehouse setting, drones can be used for aerial inspection and can even carry out maintenance requests, all of which can save manufacturers vast amounts of time.\n\nGiven drones’ ability to quickly transport small items, many tech companies are trying their hand at developing aerial transportation modes. For instance, logistics startup Zipline has created unmanned drones designed to quickly deliver goods, reduce emissions and integrate with existing operations.\n\n3D Printing in Logistics\n\nWhile there are many options when it comes to packaging and delivering goods quickly, supply chain experts are still searching for ways to manufacture products at a speed that meet consumers’ growing expectations. For this reason, 3D printing has entered the logistics space as a possible solution. The process of gathering supplies and producing a product often requires the most time and effort within the supply chain setting.\n\nIf 3D printing were applied to the production process, consumers would have greater control over the supply chain. Potentially, a consumer could place an order for a product and then a local 3D printer shop would quickly create the product before sending it out for delivery. 3D printing could ultimately disrupt the logistics industry, as it offers manufacturers the opportunity to produce complex and customized goods faster than ever before.",

      "# [What Is Wearable Technology? Examples of Wearables](https://builtin.com/wearables)\nWhat Is Wearable Technology?\n\nIt seems like everything nowadays is a smart device. Smart toasters. Smart dog collars. Smart homes. In the age of smart, there is nothing more intelligent or more innovative than the devices being produced by the wearables industry.\n\nWearable devices help collect and analyze real-time personal data that informs us on everything from our health to our workouts. They’ve become extremely popular tools to help us stay informed and in touch with ourselves to the point that almost a quarter of people in the U.S. now sport a wearable device.\n\nWhat Are Wearables?\n\nWearables make up a broad category that includes any device worn or attached to a user’s body. Smart watches, VR headsets and wearable electrocardiograms are a few examples. These devices support purposes related to areas like health and fitness, entertainment and everyday use.\n\nWhat exactly is a wearable? Wearables are electronic devices that are worn on a person — usually close to the skin — in order to accurately relay important medical, biological and exercise data to a database.\n\nWearables have helped make the IoT industry the $594 billion dollar behemoth it is today (the wearables industry itself is expected to balloon to $111 billion by 2027). Apple Watches and Fitbits are classic examples of wearable technology, but those aren’t the only devices being developed today. In addition to smart watches, VR and AR technology, smart jackets and a wide variety of other gadgets are leading us towards a better-connected lifestyle. Each device’s main job is to collect millions of data points that range from how many steps you take to your heart rate.\n\nBenefits of Wearables\n\nThe advancement of wearables has been a welcomed tool for the insurance, healthcare and sports industries for a number of reasons. From encouraging healthier habits to optimizing physical performance, industries have reaped numerous rewards that come with wearable tech.\n\nWearables Improve Healthcare\n\nThe healthcare industry is probably seeing the biggest benefit from wearable technology. Patients who wear these smart devices can measure information ranging from body temperature to blood pressure, which is then relayed to their medical team in real-time. If something looks off, doctors have a quicker way to accurately diagnose and treat a patient. The entire treatment process is now quicker thanks to the data collected by a wearable device because doctors no longer have to run a gamut of tests to determine an illness or disease. They can reference the data collected by a wearable to quickly figure out the cause of the medical mishap.\n\nBest Wearables Companies Hiring NowView the Top Wearables Companies With Open Jobs\n\nWearables Provide More Insights Into Sports and Fitness Performance\n\nHaving all of this health data in real-time is, of course, helping the sports and fitness industries push the boundaries of training. Professional athletes from all over the world maximize their training regimes thanks to the biometric data captured through wearable technology. Elite athletes, from marathon runners to the Golden State Warriors and Liverpool FC, are using smart compression shirts to maximize every move an athlete makes. These smart shirts use a combination of GPS, accelerometers and biomedical sensors to constantly measure the performance of each athlete. Is Liverpool superstar Mo Salah taking the optimal route to a ball? Is NBA all-star Steph Curry maximizing his hydration levels to perform at his peak ability? How can MLB players, like Mike Trout or Kris Bryant, maximize their acceleration out of the batter’s box? Wearable technology is the key to answering these questions and unlocking the optimal potential of world-class athletes.\n\nWearables Increase the Productivity and Health of Workforces\n\nThe business world has benefited from the introduction of wearables to its workforce. Seventy-nine percent of employees who wear a smart device in the office report that the devices are instrumental to their work. Equipping a workforce with wearable devices makes sense for employers. These devices enhance communication, track employee activity, boost job site safety measures and can actually improve the health and quality of life for a workforce. A healthier, happier workforce will then lead to higher rates of employee retention, saving companies thousands, if not millions, of dollars annually.\n\nExamples of Wearable Technologies\n\nHealth and Fitness Wearables\n\nWearables are often associated with the health and wellness sectors. Smart watches, like a Fitbit or Apple Watch, have pioneered the way we track everything from heart rates to our daily steps. Constantly checking in with them has become part of a daily routine for many.\n\nThese watches inherently encourage healthier lifestyles because of the data they collect. Knowing how far you run encourages you to push yourself further to beat your old record. Seeing that you’re almost to your daily 10,000-step goal encourages you to go for a walk around the block. Even tracking your current sleep habits could lead to changes that help you sleep more soundly at night. In a sense, wearable tech is one of the best ways to gamify the health and wellness journey.\n\nLife Insurance Wearables\n\nIn order to promote healthier lifestyles, life insurance companies issue wearables to their customers, who then track their health data. Devices like smart watches and fitness trackers provide details on someone’s activity levels, heart rate and other important health data points. The data collected informs premium prices and can paint a more accurate picture about the overall health of life insurance customers. It’s a much more concrete method rather than relying on a vague metric, such as one’s age, when creating an individual policy.\n\nGaming Wearables\n\nGaming is one of the biggest frontiers for wearable technology. Virtual reality (VR) headsets are the most common form of wearable devices in the industry. VR headsets, like the Oculus Rift or the Playstation VR, instantly immerse gamers in other-worldly experiences from the second they strap in. Do you want to know how it would feel to fight with Lightsabers? Maybe you really want to live out your adrenaline junky dreams of racing in the Indianapolis 500? VR wearables are bringing awe-inspiring experiences like these to gamers all over the world.\n\nWearable technologies taking off in the gaming industry are haptic devices. These smart wearables provide tactile feedback to a gamer in real time. This means that a device takes advantage of a gamer’s sense of touch by providing force or vibrations to a user. To put it simply, haptic vests, gloves or suits make gaming more realistic — a gamer can now feel actual recoil after shooting their virtual weapon or can even experience real feedback of what it feels like to dribble a virtual basketball. Though still in its infancy, haptic technology is poised to make the future of gaming, and wearables, more entertaining and realistic.\n\nFashion Wearables\n\nIt only makes sense that wearable tech has started to permeate fashion culture. Athletes wear full-body suits, equipped with hundreds of little IoT sensors, to measure their every move. The data gathered will help them to better optimize their swing, shot or kick. The consumer wearable technology clothing industry is still relatively new, albeit already intriguing. Smart jackets are being made to automatically cool or warm the body based on body temperatures taken from sensors throughout the jacket. Smart rings are giving people a stylish way to track their steps or measure their sleep habits. Our pants might one day become smart enough to use the thermal energy our bodies naturally produce to charge our cell phones. Wearable devices in fashion demonstrate that tech can be smart and sophisticated all at once.\n\nTravel Wearables\n\nThe ability of smart wearables to immerse users in virtual environments has made them a vital tool for the travel industry. With VR technology, companies can provide in-depth virtual tours of hotel rooms, local landmarks and other potential destinations. People can then make more informed decisions about where they choose to stay and visit, resulting in a higher-quality travel experience for customers.\n\nMany airlines also cater to wearable devices, allowing customers to store tickets and boarding passes in a digital wallet like Apple Wallet. If someone is wearing a smart watch, they can pull up any necessary passes for a faster entry and boarding process.\n\nEducation Wearables\n\nEducation has had to adapt to the digital age, and wearable tech has helped the industry catch up with the latest developments. Smart glasses and VR headsets enable organizations to train students and employees through simulations and virtual environments. Users are immersed in a real-life scenario, allowing them to spend more time learning by doing rather than listening to a lecture or presentation.\n\nIn addition, brain sensor headbands track when someone’s mind is stressed and relaxed. Educators can leverage this device to learn when students are pushing their minds too much and teach them how to remain calm while taking in new experiences and knowledge.\n\nLogistics Wearables\n\nAnother beneficiary of wearables is the logistics industry, which relies on wearable tech to develop more efficient operations. Smart glasses like Google Glass enable warehouse workers to quickly scan barcodes, pull up information from a database and make updates along the way. This process eliminates the need for workers to keep going back to a physical computer, saving them time as they organize packages and items.\n\nSome VR glasses go as far as to help workers determine their location in a large warehouse, mapping out the optimal route to travel between two points. These glasses can also reveal the best ways to organize packages for maximized storage without crushing lighter items. All these abilities make wearable devices a must-have for logistics companies.",
      "# [Finance Definition: Finance Industry, Skills & Jobs](https://builtin.com/finance)\nWhat Is Finance?\n\nFinance is a term that describes the business of managing money. It can refer to lending, investing, forecasting and any range of other activities related to the distribution and trading of financial assets. The business of finance can be separated into three categories: personal finance, corporate finance, and public finance.\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nPersonal finance describes anything relating to individual or family financial planning — mortgage borrowing, estate planning and retirement investing can all be grouped together as personal finance.\n\nCorporate Finance\n\nCorporate finance refers to how businesses and large enterprises maintain control over their spend, investments and shareholder value.\n\nPublic Finance\n\nPublic or government finance is characterized as the analysis of how funds can be allocated toward public interests, with which government entities can make decisions about trade regulations, taxes, and public expenditures.\n\nAs long as currency is exchanged, the financial industry will continue to flourish. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts overall employment for business and financial occupations will grow by roughly 7 percent between 2021 and 2031, resulting in an estimated 715,100 new jobs. The financial research organization Opimas discovered that around 35 percent of new job postings are for tech professionals and data scientists.\n\nCompetition for finding and keeping the best talent in finance has been heating up. Among hiring managers working to fill accounting and financial positions, more than 80 percent at public companies and roughly 69 percent at private companies said they’ll have to work hard to attract and retain employees. They identified the top three drivers of this urgency to be increasing workloads, the need for technological skills and attrition as a result of the Great Resignation.\n\nThe exponential growth in tech-related finance positions can be attributed to the growth of global capital as a whole. It has been estimated that there are over 3 million e-commerce companies headquartered across the globe, but that number doesn't begin to represent the innumerable ways that businesses, organizations and individuals exchange money digitally. As more players in the global economy move online, financial institutions need to be able to manage and transfer massive amounts of money both online and in person.\n\nNoteworthy Fintech Companies\n\nChime\n\nRiskified\n\nPaxful\n\nADP\n\nVerifi\n\nSpotOn\n\nSupernova Technology\n\nTech professionals, especially those skilled in computer programming and data science, enjoy a desirable status among finance world recruiters.

Common entry-level finance positions include junior accountant, budget analyst, financial analyst, personal financial advisor, financial auditor and credit analyst.\n\nTake a job like financial analyst, for example, and you’ll see the median annual wages sit at $95,570, while the median for all U.S. occupations is $45,760, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Earnings for financial and investment analysts can range from less than $60,000 to more than $166,000.\n\nA big factor in determining the average salary for a finance professional can be demand. For instance, in a city as bustling and competitive as New York, a higher-level job such as senior financial analyst can enjoy an average base salary of $108,313, compared to an overall national base salary average of $102,570.\n\nSkills Needed for a Job in Finance\n\nGreat Skills for Jobs in Fintech\n\nAccounting skills\n\nUnderstanding of forecasting and reporting\n\nKnowledge of finance software like QuickBooks\n\nData science programming languages like Python\n\nStrong attention to detail\n\nAbility to perform under pressure\n\nLike any other profession, a successful career in finance requires a combination of both soft and hard skills. Any aspiring finance professional must begin with a strong set of basic accounting skills. Since finance is primarily a numbers game, those looking to succeed in the industry have to have strong mathematics skills in order to understand cash flow, budgeting, and cost analysis. The need for market trend and spend forecasting makes a well-developed understanding of data science another essential hard skill. Additionally, today’s aspiring financial analysts are expected to have a level of comfort with programming and software, as more and more organizations employ platforms like QuickBooks and Python to conduct prediction models and develop future strategies.\n\nAs for soft skills, strong communication and stress management capabilities are key to building a good reputation in the finance world. Any top finance professional needs to be able to convey pertinent financial information to clients or managers through financial reports or presentations, and as such must be able to effectively articulate big trends or potential directions as succinctly and accurately as possible. Like any other job, finance professionals need to be able to perform under pressure and feel comfortable working with certain amounts of risk. In addition to this, due to the nature of finance and working with money, it's also important to maintain strong attention to detail and demonstrate high organizational skills.",
      "# [A Look Into the Gaming Industry: Types of Video Games and Gaming Jobs](https://builtin.com/gaming)\nGaming Industry Overview\n\nThe gaming industry, a current $200 billion behemoth, is arguably one of the most important and innovative sectors in tech today. Its importance to culture, social networking and entertainment cannot be understated. The term “entertainment industry” is no longer reserved for Hollywood and the movie industry because gaming is now providing one of the most immersive and awe-inspiring forms of entertainment to more than three billion people around the globe.\n\nNobody could imagine what the gaming industry would blossom into when they were messing around with Pong joysticks in their basements and competing against their friends for the highest Pac-Man scores in the 1970s and ‘80s. These simple games would turn out to be the bedrock of today’s gaming industry and instant cultural phenomena.\n\nPioneered by evergrowing gaming companies, the current gaming industry is pushing the boundaries of technology to create cutting-edge and highly immersive entertainment experiences. Not only do we have the continuous advent of new consoles, PCs and devices that are putting us right into the game, but we also have the opportunity to watch some of the best gamers in the world compete in the esports arena and online through streaming platforms like Twitch and Mixer.\n\nGaming Platforms\n\nThe gaming wars of today are just heating up. The battle over console gaming is being waged by Microsoft (Xbox), Sony (Playstation) and Nintendo (Switch). These platforms are pushing the absolute boundaries of technology by offering gamers state-of-the-art graphics, speeds and processing powers.\n\nTraditional console makers, like Microsoft, will likely have to compete with cloud gaming platforms whose games available to those anywhere with any decent internet connection. Even Netflix is getting in on the gaming action. Additionally, PC gaming has opened up a world of opportunities for gamers who are looking for extra ease-of-use and dexterity when casually playing (or competing in) their favorite games.\n\nBest Gaming Companies With Open JobsView Top Gaming Companies Hiring Now\n\nEsports\n\nPicture your favorite sport. All sports, whether it’s soccer, basketball or baseball, have many things in common: passionate fans, sold-out stadiums, engaging commentators and world-class athletes. The same thing is true in the world of esports. esports athletes are essentially the Michael Jordans of their profession, but instead of dunking on opponents on a court, they’re outwitting, outmaneuvering and outplaying their opponents in virtual worlds. Thousands of screaming fans pack the arena to root on their teams who are sitting on stage clicking away for a chance at a title, while millions more watch online around the world.\n\nBy 2025, esports is projected to garner more than 640 million viewers worldwide, with about 318 million of those viewers specifically falling into the category of esports enthusiasts. With a growing fanbase that may rival any professional sport on earth, it’s no wonder that cultural icons and savvy investors, like basketball legend Michael Jordan, rapper Drake and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, all own at least partial stakes in esports teams.\n\nVideo Game Streaming\n\nStreaming has also been a massive success for the gaming industry and gamers alike. Platforms that support streaming like Twitch and Youtube Gaming give individual gamers the opportunity to livestream their in-game play to subscribers all over the world.\n\nThis innovation has allowed millions of streamers to gain a fanbase, interact with one another and monetize their gaming skills. Streaming has become uber-popular to the point where Twitch alone, the most-watched game streaming platform, garnered almost 1.5 billion minutes of watchtime in 2021. Breakout successes in the streaming industry, like Tyler “Ninja” Blevins, have been able to make upwards of $10 million a year just through the fans and endorsement deals that come with running a popular streaming profile.\n\nThe meteoric rise of the gaming industry is just getting started. Born from humble beginnings, today’s gaming sector is ready to take on any other in tech for the title of the most innovative industry. What makes gaming so special is that it’s not only immersive and entertaining, but it’s inclusive and expansive as well. There is a game and a way to play for almost every human, which makes gaming one of the most beloved industries in the world.\n\nGaming Equipment and Technology\n\nConsole Gaming\n\nConsole gaming is the original (and probably most well-known) form of digital gaming. In the early days, Nintendo and Sega dominated the market for consoles. Today, Xbox and Playstation have become the two most popular consoles, offering millions of players the ability to experience the latest in gaming technology.\n\nConsoles have been a good indicator of the tech market as a whole. In the beginning, consoles were simple joysticks just technologically-ept enough to run simple games like Pong. Now, consoles, like the new Xbox Series X, have specially designed microchips that process images and power as efficiently as possible, all the while, being designed for 8K television screens. Gaming consoles are truly pushing the limits of consumer entertainment technology.\n\nPC Gaming\n\nPCs have had a meteoric rise in gameplay with almost 1.8 billion people using computers as their gaming tool of choice by the end of 2022. Gaming computers are all about efficiency. Gaming PCs have their own dedicated RAM space, GPUs and cooling systems that help to efficiently run games in real-time. These bulked-up computers can handle graphically demanding games and can even make it easier for streamers who need a reliable system to manage gaming at a high level and livestreaming their gameplay at the same time. Games like Fortnite, League of Legends and Minecraft have made gaming one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world today.\n\nQuantum computing is a sector to look out for when it comes to gaming. Still in its infancy, quantum computing has the ability to completely upend the gaming industry (and world) as we know it. These computers dwarf anything that computers can do now, and this technology is primed to make an impact in the gaming industry. Because quantum computers have unfathomable amounts of power and information storage, they’re able to render the best graphics imaginable in real time. These computers also fix a huge problem currently plaguing the gaming industry; predictability. Who wants to play a game where they know exactly what happens? A quantum computer’s massive storage of algorithms could actually make gaming unpredictable and unique for each gamer.\n\nBest E-Sports Companies With Open RolesView Top E-Sports Companies Hiring Now\n\nCloud Gaming\n\nCloud gaming is the newest type of video game technology making headlines. Imagine Netflix, but for gaming. You scroll through a library of games, choose which game you want and automatically start playing the game. No discs and no load times. Play on your phone, iPad or console. Cloud-based gaming platforms aim to make the whole gaming experience seamless and easy to play from anywhere at any time.\n\nCloud gaming is such a threat to traditional console gaming that Microsoft’s head of gaming, Phil Spencer, stated that Xbox is no longer concerned about competition from Nintendo or Playstation in 2020. Rather, they’re more focused on competing with the ultra-fast cloud platforms being hosted by companies like Amazon and Google. It is worth noting, however, that Google’s cloud-based gaming platform, Stadia, is shutting down in 2023.\n\nVR/AR Gaming\n\nVirtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are meant to put you right in the middle of the action. Instead of playing from a third person point-of-view, VR drops people into computer-generated environments to make them feel like they’re actually part of the game. VR offers gamers the ability to step into magical worlds and do everything from kick around a soccer ball to fight off hordes of monsters (like in the video above). Additionally, being directly a part of these kinds of digital worlds has made the draw to the metaverse that more appealing.\n\nAugmented reality, on-the-other-hand, adds digital influences to real life. A popular example of AR in gaming is the mobile game Pokémon Go, in which smartphone cameras are used to find and capture virtual creatures in the real world. Gamers might come across a Pikachu in the park or even find a Wartortle on their walk to work.\n\nWhether our reality is augmented or virtual, it’s clear to see that technology is ushering in a completely new way to participate in, and enjoy, video games.\n\nMobile Gaming\n\nMobile gaming makes up about 45 percent of the total market share of the gaming industry with over half of the worldwide population projected to play a mobile game by 2027.\n\nWhy is mobile gaming so popular? It’s easily accessible and has games for every type of gamer. Instead of having to strap on a headset or pop a disc into a console, mobile gaming allows us to play wherever we go and whenever we want. In 2020, it took over television as the preferred choice of leisure activity with people spending more than 6.5 hours per week on mobile games.\n\nThe mobile gaming industry is poised for continual growth as investments in mobile gaming startups have skyrocketed, and creativity opens up avenues for more gamers to enjoy different types of exciting games.\n\nMore On GamingWhat Does the Future of Gaming Look Like?\n\nPopular Gaming Jobs\n\nTypes of Gaming Jobs\n\nVideo game designer\n\nVideo game programmer\n\nVideo game animator\n\nVideo game quality assurance (QA) tester\n\nVideo Game Designer\n\nThat incredibly intricate, expansive and beautifully designed game you’re playing didn’t just appear out of thin air. It took a team of extraordinarily talented video game designers months, even years, to create all the dimensions that a user encounters when playing a game. These designers go through several prototypes of the game before rendering the final, customer-facing version. This requires an ability to be focused and resilient, as well as, an extensive background knowledge of game design techniques, tools and skills.\n\nGame design, especially at the highest level, usually requires a bachelor’s or master’s degree with a vast knowledge in everything from 3D animation to graphic design and even physics. The job outlook for game design looks really steady because of the enormous rise in console, PC and mobile gaming. Cities like Los angeles, New York and Chicago employ the most designers, and a video game designer can make an average of $42,900 a year.\n\nMore On Game Design18 Video Game Design Courses to Know\n\nVideo Game Programmer\n\nVideo game programmers are some of the most sought-after individuals in the gaming industry. They’re the people who bring a designer’s work to life through code. A good video game would be nothing without the hard work of a programmer, who ensures that characters, missions and environments are supposed to interact the way they were intended. Most game programmers usually have at least a bachelor’s degree, but all need a vast competence of C++ (and other languages) in order to thrive.\n\nGaming’s popularity has caused a boom in industry hiring for programmers and it’s not projected to slow down. Job growth isn’t the only positive aspect about being a game programmer. The salary is too.\n\nThe median salary for software developers, which can encompass computer programming and digital design, is more than $109,000 annually. This puts programmers up there with some of the most well-paid positions in the U.S.\n\nVideo Game Animator\n\nYou can’t have a high quality game without video game animators. Game animators combine technology and art to create the interactive images and sequences that help tell the story of the game. Animators work closely with designers and programmers to make sure that a game’s environment interacts in a way that is natural, fun and helps to progress the game. Animators start every project with a basic storyboard, then help bring that story to life through a series of intricate animations. Animators usually have an extensive background in multimedia knowledge, as well as a degree in a field like computer graphics or animation.\n\nThe video game animation field is projected to grow by about 16 percent until 2030, meaning animators can expect to see a healthy salary. On a median salary, animators can expect a value of around $79,000.\n\nVideo Game Testing and Quality Assurance (QA)\n\nGetting paid to play video games might be the ultimate dream job. Luckily, video game testers (better known as video game quality assurance testers) get paid to play, but more importantly, break, video games. Game QA testers push the work of designers, programmers and animators to the limits to ensure that games are free of bugs and allow for gamers to have the freedom to explore in these virtual environments. Testers usually run through what is called matrix testing, where they have to test every permutation and combination of events that could possibly happen in a game to ensure that nothing can break it.\n\nThere are really no essential educational credentials to have when it comes to QA testing video games. However, these testers need to have an eye for details, a tolerance for repetition and an intense passion for the gaming industry. Video game testers are in demand right now (especially in mobile gaming) due to the rapid increase of games being produced. Game and QA testers on average make around $55,000 annually.",
      "# [Recruiting: Definition, Process, Types by Andy Santos on 2019-04-12](https://builtin.com/recruiting)\nRecruiting is the stage of the employee life cycle in which prospective candidates are sourced, interviewed and assessed to identify the best fit for a job opening. This process of identifying who will be hired is typically based on required skills, relevant background and whether or not the person is culturally additive to the organization. In other words, is the person a great fit based on their qualifications and alignment with the company’s values?\n\nHow Does Recruiting Work?\n\nRecruiting typically follows this process: sourcing, recruiter screen, hiring team assessment and finally, the offer stage.\n\nSourcing\n\nSourcing begins the process of recruiting, and can be classified as either passive or active. Generally, recruiters will utilize both ways of sourcing.\n\nPassive sourcing is when a recruiter sources by posting open positions on the company’s career site and various job sites to collect applicants.\n\nActive sourcing is when a recruiter directly reaches out to prospective candidates who closely match job requirements for an open position. Recruiters do this outreach over various online networking platforms and social media, as well as during in-person events.\n\nRecruiter Screen\n\nOnce a recruiter successfully sources a candidate, they’ll follow up with a recruiter screen with the candidate. This initial screening phase allows the recruiter to get a sense of the candidate’s background and skills to identify if they should move forward in the process. This also allows the candidate to get more information about the role and the company, as well as ask questions that are important to their decision-making.\n\nHiring Team Assessment\n\nCandidates that pass their initial screens will make their way to the hiring team interview phase where there is a greater focus on assessing the candidate’s skills. Depending on the role’s required skills, these assessments can vary and include coding assessments, writing challenges, Q&As and more.\n\nJob Offer\n\nCandidates who are identified to be the best fit for the role based on the hiring team’s needs are extended an offer. In this stage of the process, the recruiter’s goal is to close the candidate and get them to join the team. Recruiters will usually go over the total compensation for the role, including salary, performance bonus, benefits, perks and additional forms of compensation such as stock options.\n\nWhy Is Recruiting Important?\n\nAs a key part of the HR team, the recruiting function enables the company to compete for and acquire talent that is essential to the success and growth of the organization. An effective recruiting team is able to attract and recruit a diverse pool of candidates for the hiring teams with whom they partner. Being one of the first experiences of the employee life cycle, recruiting is critical to providing an excellent experience for potential employees, while building talent brand awareness for a company.\n\nTypes of Recruiting\n\nInternal recruiting is the act of recruiting by promoting job openings to existing employees as a way to provide career development opportunities and help with employee retention.\n\nTechnical recruiting focuses on recruiting candidates for technical positions, such as engineering and product roles. Some of these roles may include software engineers, network architects, product managers and QA specialists.\n\nExecutive recruiting focuses on recruiting candidates to fill executive-level positions, such as CFO, CTO and CEO. Executive recruiters may also work on other senior management roles that may not be at C-level.\n\nFull cycle recruiting, sometimes called end-to-end recruiting, describes the holistic recruiting process in which a recruiter is not only responsible for sourcing and hiring new employees, but also for onboarding them into the company.\n\nRecruiting Benefits\n\nEffective recruiting can boost positive brand awareness as a recruiting team’s outreach extends to more people.\n\nAs candidates consistently experience a great interview process, it is more likely for them to engage with the company’s brand and refer others.\n\nRecruiting Risks\n\nWhen ineffective, recruiting can negatively affect a company’s talent brand.\n\nIn cases where candidates go through a bad interview experience, it’s possible those candidates may speak negatively about the company, whether by leaving a review online or through word-of-mouth.\n\nWhat Is Recruitment 3.0?\n\nRecruitment 3.0 is a blend of strategic employer branding and inbound recruiting designed to capture the attention of passive candidates. It blends traditional recruiting with modern digital and content marketing strategies, enabling recruiters to sidestep conventional platforms and professional networks to connect directly with candidates in a more organic and meaningful way.\n\nSimply put, Recruitment 3.0 reflects two core challenges of modern recruiting:\n\nThe most in-demand candidates aren’t browsing traditional job boards for their next opportunity — Traditional job boards are losing their appeal to top talent, with 80 percent of job seekers using social media and 73 percent of job seekers between 18-34 years old finding their last job through social media. Even then, as much as 80 percent of jobs are found through professional networking and personal connections rather than searching online.\n\nCandidates are doing more research than ever before applying — If you are lucky enough to capture the attention of an elite candidate, you better hope your online presence tells a good story. According to an Indeed survey, 54 percent of candidates research every company before applying and 56 percent reference employee reviews found on job sites like Indeed.\n\nTo address these challenges, recruiters must leverage new platforms and techniques to fulfill their obligations. Enter Recruitment 3.0.\n\nThe Case For Recruitment 3.0\n\nWe’ve covered a few statistics already, but let’s take a deeper dive into the modern recruiting landscape.\n\nThe ratio of hires per job posting fell below 0.5 hires per job posting in 2023, meaning one out of every two job postings fails to result in a hire. While trends like ghost jobs could contribute to this drop, these days traditional job boards shouldn’t be the core of your recruitment strategy.\n\n39 percent of job candidates said employers and recruiters gave them misleading information, and 51 percent abandoned the recruitment process due to poor communication. Ask yourself this: Are you providing candidates with the information they need to be informed about the job and the company?\n\n63 percent of employers report an inability to find qualified candidates as the main obstacle to their hiring efforts. Looks like those informed candidates are hard to come by after all.\n\n79 percent of software developers — the most in-demand talent out there — are open to new opportunities. Just one more example of the opportunity that’s out there for recruiters who can find a way to connect with passive candidates.\n\nThe average time to hire is 44 days, while the average cost per hire is nearly $4,700. If nothing else can convince management to make recruiting a priority, perhaps the bottom line will.\n\nCandidates trust recruiters less than hiring managers and other employees as sources of information, with 40 percent of entry-level candidates preferring to ask other employees about the culture of the team they’re applying to. Yikes. The average candidate will likely doubt your recruiting team’s credibility.\n\nJob seekers are 15 times more likely to choose a company that’s been certified as a great workplace by its own employees. Candidates care about a company’s reputation, and they want to hear what employees themselves think about the workplace.\n\nNegative information about a company’s culture would strongly discourage 28 percent of U.S. job seekers from applying and make 42 percent less likely to apply. Job seekers are getting better and better at doing their research. Will they like what they find out about your company?\n\nEmployers claim they can’t find qualified candidates, while candidates seem to distrust recruiters. Plenty of passive candidates are open to new opportunities, but recruiters can’t find a way to connect with them. Traditional job boards are disdained by many candidates, but recruiters continue to use them.\n\nAnd in the midst of this, candidates have become more savvy than ever. From employer reviews to your employer brand, they have access to vast amounts of information, and they’re using it to their advantage.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

Make a list of companies you want to work for, regardless of whether they currently have an appropriate job opening for you. Consult your network to see if you know anyone who works there, or who might know someone who works there. Conduct informational interviews with these people. Bookmark the company website career pages and subscribe to updates, if available. Apply directly to hiring managers instead of through the ATS. It's a lot more legwork than hitting the Apply button on a job listing, but it gives you more control over the process.\n\n#### Comment ID kspn1ll with +11 score by [(Keep-Moving-789, Reddit, 2024-02-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/kspn1ll/) (in reply to ID ivan0wk):\nHow do u go about finding who the hiring manager is and how to contact them?\n\n#### Comment ID lhpf73q with +17 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/lhpf73q/) (in reply to ID ivan0wk):\n[removed]\n\n#### Comment ID l9g41l4 with +2 score by [(PipeOk1634, Reddit, 2024-06-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/l9g41l4/) (in reply to ID ivan0wk):\nHow do you find the companies you can work for?

Reach out to friends, former colleagues, or acquaintances who may have connections at these companies. Ask if they can introduce you to someone who works there or if they can provide insights about the company culture and potential opportunities.

You can even add which technologies you’ve utilized at roles the way LinkedIn is currently trying to add skills. Not all the jobs are technical, like programming or product management, but if you’re in the tech industry, that’s the niche the job board is in. \n\nSomething really nice about Otta is that they include the Glassdoor ratings for companies as well, which is great because sometimes startups, especially the earlier stage or ones with <500 employees, can be a bit dicey around inexperienced management and claiming work/life balance while in reality push the “hustle” mentality. \n\nThey’re great for finding Remote-based work as well, since a lot of startups/fast-paced growing companies don’t care yet about HR laws and regulations across different states, they care about the talent. Once companies get bigger and older, they typically only hire remotely from states where they have established entities because of all the paperwork and the need to stay up-to-date with individual state compliance.\n\n- Edited for clarity around tech industry/companies versus tech positions like programming.\n\n#### Comment ID ivb743n with +2 score by [(that_writer_dream, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/ivb743n/) (in reply to ID ivb0vfu):\nThey actually work with a pretty even amount of start-ups and large companies (Deliveroo, Bumble, Spotify, the Financial Times).

It's helped me land several interviews whereas on the company website you can easily get screened out. Apply on BOTH LinkedIn and the company website.\n\nThe benefit of LinkedIn easy apply is that for several companies (not all) let you just send in a resume without any additional info unlike the company site where you have to waste time copying your resume. Also, if you are getting screened out, recruiters can see your resume more easily through LinkedIn especially if you are one of the first applications. You often get notified if your resume gets read or downloaded, which doesn't mean anything, but gives you additional data on what types of roles and companies are interested.\n\nI've landed two solid jobs through LinkedIn easy apply.

If an offer sounds too good to be true, if the wording feels awkward and overly vague, etc.\n\nMuch of this knowledge just comes from being in an industry for a while and recognizing the normal way roles are talked about. \n\nThat said, here’s the steps I would recommend for everyone:\n\n1. Do enough research into your industry to recognize the standard job title naming conventions and job scope for your level. For example, an entry level marketing role is typically going to be called something like “marketing associate” or “marketing coordinator”, or more specific depending on branch of marketing, so “content marketing associate” etc. For job scope, there will be a few things in your industry that you’ll learn are red flags. For marketing, if they talk about outbound calling, prospecting, sales, etc. then it’s likely a sales role pretending to be a marketing role. If you don’t know what these red flags are in your industry, reach out to a more senior member of this industry through LinkedIn and ask them directly, “what red flags should I watch out for in job postings?”\n\n2. Assuming you find a role that passes the job title and job scope test, start Googling the company. Search for things like “ X company reviews” and “X company scam”. Then visit 1. The companies Glassdoor page 2. The company’s LinkedIn page 3. The company’s website\n\n2a. Does there Glassdoor have multiple positive reviews, salaries listed, etc? (If the company is a small startup, they may have limited info here but still be legit).\n\n2b. Is the company findable on LinkedIn? Do they have many people who say they work there?  Click into these people and make sure they all seem legit. To they have previous experience at different companies? Do they seem to be active profiles?\n\n2c. Finally, visit their website. Does it seem to be a full website? (Not just one or two pages). Does the branding seem trustworthy? Then find the internal job listings page on the website. Is the job listing you saw also listed on their website? If not, there’s a chance that the company is legit, but scammers are pretending to be from the company when they’re not.\n\nIf after all of this, the company still seems legitimate, than apply! When interviewing, make sure you:\n 1. Meet the interviewers face-to-face or on a video chat sometime in the interview process (most start with a phone screen, that’s okay as long as you video chat later). \n2. Only communicate with email addresses that are linked to the company. Example: john@amazon.com. \n3. Don’t give any personal banking or social security # information until contracts have been signed and finalized and you feel 200% sure they are for real.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n### Comment ID ivbjona with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/ivbjona/) (in reply to ID iva7h7u):\nkey word.  \"Depending on industries\".  lol\n\n## Comment ID ivadsk1 with +11 score by [(bryanhernc, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/ivadsk1/) (in reply to ID ynpo8w):\nI’ve had good experiences with indeed and ZipRecruiter.

I wanted to essentially create something that would check my CV, and find the most relevant jobs on the internet to return them back to me in seconds. Better than spending hours on LinkedIn reading irrelevant long job postings (even skimming them was boring)\n\nThe apps i found would use ai to apply to jobs for you and I found some scary reviews. Apparently they just send applications made with AI absolutely everywhere hoping you land one. They are playing a number game basically. \n\nI knew the tool had to be an assistant. not an automation. The only automation id allow would be the one that finds the relevant jobs for me. the cv and cover letter writing can be supported by AI but not fully generated by AI. Something like a draft at most.\n\nAnyways... long story short. I took matter into my own hands and created [wizapply.app](http://wizapply.app) .

Word of mouth can be good as well if you know someone or just choose where you want your work and make an appointment with Human resources.\n\n### Comment ID l2ivf6r with +1 score by [(Comprehensive_Sale69, Reddit, 2024-05-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/l2ivf6r/) (in reply to ID kw9qpsf):\ndo you have any head hunter services or employment agencies you can refer? i have reached out to a few companies myself and nothing is working out. i am also in a leadership position and don't seem to get any traction\n\n## Comment ID lfkth8v with +1 score by [(AcademicGanache6322, Reddit, 2024-07-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/lfkth8v/) (in reply to ID ynpo8w):\nhey\n\n## Comment ID lgmb740 with +1 score by [(Artistic_Ladder9570, Reddit, 2024-08-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/lgmb740/) (in reply to ID ynpo8w):\ni have no idea, i'm currently trying to find one myself\n\n## Comment ID ivav7u4 with +1 score by [(T2Squad3, Reddit, 2022-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ynpo8w/what_are_the_best_places_to_search_for_jobs/ivav7u4/) (in reply to ID ynpo8w):\nYour network.

Full time.  Last year during full on covid.\n\nLinkedIn, Indeed, and a network of recruiters I have come to know from many contracts I have done.  \n\nIndeed was the worst, and normally was just cross posts and never used the Indeed built in system\n\nLinkedIn was actually pretty awesome with the open to work feature and their revamped job searching. \n\nMy recruiter network got me a handful of interviews  and an offer.\n\nLinkedIn recruiter who got in touch with me actually got me the position, so a huge win for LinkedIn. I used the offer I had to knock my pay up even more.  Thanks job I was never going to take!\n\nThese recruiters use tools to search LinkedIn profiles for keywords, so your profile can literally make or break you.  These recruiters don't understand what x buzzword is. They spend seconds on your profile to see if you are a possible match and move on, so your profile should be as complete as possible..  Have some project work to give them an idea of what kind of work you can do.\n\nThe better my profile was, the more I got random recruiters  to contact me, and about better jobs.\n\nThis is the way now.  Learn it and get a better job.\n\n### Comment ID hmuxmau with +1 score by [(nicepersondonthate, Reddit, 2021-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hmuxmau/) (in reply to ID hm2lnfx):\nenjoy being replaced soon, since you used the \"i got another job offer card\", can only use that once then you are on their shit list.

That wasn't the point of the comment, though I guess I could have worded it better.  It was meant to be a quick response for OP's question.\n\nWhat actually happened in my case was that I received an offer for a higher paying job at a larger company.  At the same time I actually really liked the team and hit it off with the CIO at a smaller company, offering less.  I negotiated informing the smaller company that I really wanted the position, but that I had another offer at a higher pay.  The smaller company came back that if we wrapped the deal up immediately they would come up and match.\n\nIt wasn't that they didn't value me, they had a price they offered for the position.  On the contrary...They liked me, I liked them, but I informed them I had a higher offer.  They thought I was worth it and went above their original salary offer.\n\nAlmost two years in, I still love the position, love the team, have a much better work/life balance than had I taken the first offer, and so wouldn't change a thing.\n\nInforming a prospective employer that you have an existing offer, and negotiating to get yourself better pay/benefits/etc. seems is pretty standard.  Was it risky?  Sure, it had elevated risk that the job I really wanted to get would leave the table, but it was something I took a chance on, and it instead validated my belief that they did value me.  Also, I had no duty to the first company, and simply informed them I would be taking another offer.  No bridges burnt, so cards used, no shit list necessary.  It's just business.  \n\nI don't really think \"the proper amount\" exists.  We negotiate with what employers feel we are worth from a multitude of reasons and what that is can be different for the same person at the same positions at various companies.\n\n## Comment ID hm27j7q with +5 score by [(Zengaroni, Reddit, 2021-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm27j7q/) (in reply to ID r1ynlc):\nI have always used LinkedIn.

Check out their websites. Apply to the gigs. Contact their recruiters on linkedin asking about the gig and if they are still hiring (e.g. get noticed.) Sometimes this can help you rise to the top.\n\nUltimately the job posting sites typically have lots of applicants. Often recruiting at places is poor and doesn't list in the right way or doesn't list anywhere but their own website, or they go through 3rd parties which don't tell you who you are working for up front.\n\nYou can get a job from many ways, just trying to offer an alternative method i've seen work. :)\n\n## Comment ID hm3iprg with +2 score by [(Big-Sploosh, Reddit, 2021-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r1ynlc/what_sites_does_everyone_use_to_job_hunt_for_it/hm3iprg/) (in reply to ID r1ynlc):\nSpeaking as someone based in the US:\n\nLinkedIn and just applying directly on the company website.  Occasionally I'll use Indeed, but a lot of times it will just take you to the company career page anyway, use Indeed to find companies rather than single job postings.  There is also USAJobs if you are looking into 2210 series jobs for federal agencies, some hiring more frequently than others (Bureau of Land Management, Indian Health Service, EPA, and in the worst case scenario; the Bureau of Prisons...)

I got my current job by finding a company I wanted to work for, cold-emailing someone at the company who went to my same undergrad, and basically asked him for career advice. Did that like 10-15 times before it worked though.\n\nEdit: just wanted to add a couple of related pointers: (1) Any connection with the person will work. Doesn’t need to be that you went to the same college. Could be same hometown, etc. LinkedIn, Google (using the advanced search function), and company bios are your friends here. (2) Some jobs are posted even though the company already has a candidate in mind. Might be for DEI reasons, or maybe they want to say “we had 100 applicants apply for this one job!” This is where networking really helps out, because they might consider you before the job is even posted. (3) Job hunting is a numbers game. I literally applied to 84 jobs during my first search.

Or so I thought.\n\nThen, when I got hired at that company, my hiring manager explained to me that he hired me not because of my perceived understanding of their products, but because my skills and experience aligned with what they were looking for in that junior role. He then went on to explain to me that the applicant-facing product I had studied was just the tip of the iceberg because:\n\n1. **I only saw/experienced about 15% of this product.** The version of it I used appeared relatively static to me, as the user. But in reality, there was a lot of conditional logic on the back end that determined which questions I saw and which materials were required/optional/not asked based on things in my profile, the way I answered questions in other parts of the application, based on which type of device I accessed the application on, etc.\n2. **Though the most well-known product from this company was their applicant-facing product, there were about 6 other products that this UX role would be working on that were either B2B or strictly internal.** Things like configuration software, administration software, client support software, software for managing client implementations and integrations of our products, etc. etc. **There was essentially no (legal) way for me to have known that, nor to have accessed those products if I did somehow know that.**\n\nMy whole point with this lengthy comment is that you should be focusing (as the other commenters said) on how well your skill and experience align with what is being asked on the job description, and understand/expect that no matter how much time and work you put into getting to know a company's products, the reality of the situation is that you can never fully know until you work there how well you actually know their products.\n\n### Comment ID hqi12b6 with +1 score by [(Internet-Citizen, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqi12b6/) (in reply to ID hqhycbm):\nAnything for the UK?\n\n#### Comment ID hqi2sdi with +1 score by [(UXette, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqi2sdi/) (in reply to ID hqi12b6):\nDon't have anything, unfortunately\n\n#### Comment ID hqpn1jv with +1 score by [(UXette, Reddit, 2021-12-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqpn1jv/) (in reply to ID hqi12b6):\nThis site has a few UK postings: https://www.ideatelabs.co/job-board\n\n### Comment ID hqjqzpe with +1 score by [(Designflystretwerguy, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqjqzpe/) (in reply to ID hqhycbm):\nMdeng is a solid resource I would also follow him\nOn LinkedIn he promotes many internship and entry level roles.\n\n#### Comment ID i9djf1z with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/i9djf1z/) (in reply to ID hqjqzpe):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID hqixx6w with +9 score by [(TheComicSansKiller, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqixx6w/) (in reply to ID rroldx):\nFollow UXers on LinkedIn, leaders, managers, directors and so on.

It took a long time for me to get good interviews, and my first job years ago. LinkedIn! Get active, like, comment, post, share articles you find interesting. Connect with EVERYONE. See if there are local design groups in your area, where I live in Utah has quite a few. Apply, apply, apply, don’t stop applying for jobs even senior ones. Just getting your resume out there is huge. People will save your resume, and call you back, make sure you’re open to new opportunities on LinkedIn too. Good luck!\n\nEdit: saying this as someone who interviews and hires designers I don’t mind people lacking experience. If they’re willing to learn, grow, and work on team I’d consider them for a position.\n\n### Comment ID hqjmu6k with +2 score by [(DevelopMatt, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqjmu6k/) (in reply to ID hqj0blz):\nGreat points, though I don’t want to spam applications.

Spamming resumes and applying to everything isn't a good general rule.  It isn't a good use of your time and it really gets you nowhere.  As someone who led a large design team and did over 70 interviews one year from hundreds of resumes, the carpet bombing approach might work for smaller startups but not for larger orgs.  You'll get lost in the noise.\n\nThat said, building connections is critical.  Make connections.  I don't mean spamming the connect button on LinkedIn, I mean sending a meaningful message - it will make you stand out.   You won't get a ton of replies but it makes you memorable.  Ideally not half assed but even half assed can be ok. So for instance sending a LinkedIn connection with the stock message = bad.  Sending one with a personal, unique but half-assed message = better.  Sending one with a hand tailored message that showed you researched the individual and their company = golden.\n\nSo for example, sending one that says \"hey, would love to connect, your experience with  doing UX for APIs is really interesting.\" is good.  Better is saying something like, \"Hey, would love to connect, your creation of a design system at YOURCOMPANY sounds really challenging, I've been studying how to improve communication of design tokens to designers and would love to chat about it with you some time.\"  This is why spamming doesn't work - start to get interested in specific things, take a deep dive - you don't have to commit to it for life but showing interest in a subject area makes you interesting to other people as well. Then find people who resonate with that subject.\n\n#### Comment ID hqkrxnl with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqkrxnl/) (in reply to ID hqjmu6k):\nYeah if you want to PM me go for it!!\n\n#### Comment ID hqksfeh with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqksfeh/) (in reply to ID hqjmu6k):\nBtw when I say apply, apply, apply,  I don’t mean spam. what I mean is, if it’s a job you want, a company you’re interested in, etc. apply, don’t be afraid.

So I don't know about the process of applying, but I can say that working for one has been very useful for learning. A government agency isn't driven by profit, so deadlines are lenient. They are also bound by their budget so they often can't afford the expensive senior designers, so I don't think it's uncommon for them to look for juniors, at least not in my country. Not all of them know about the benefits of UX though and might not be looking for one for that reason alone. However, having responsive and accessible websites is becoming more important for governments since excluding people with disabilities from a public service isn't legal. So it's not crazy to assume that some of them might be in dire need of some UX! Might be worth looking into.\n\n### Comment ID hqjnnqu with +2 score by [(DevelopMatt, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqjnnqu/) (in reply to ID hqj7fv8):\nNoted.

What I would emphasise is focus on creating a body of good work, and on top of that, networking, instead of cold applying  \n\n\nAll I had when I started was 1 *very good school project* that I worked my ass off on. When I say good I mean in the sense that \"client loved it, it got the highest possible grade, the professor wanted my group to write a paper about it\" - I made it the centerpiece of my portfolio when applied for an internship.  \n\n\nEnd of my first semester I saw a tweet from the head of a studio in my city while my exams were going on at my university, where I was studying my Master’s in Design. I was interested, so I looked a bit more at their website, and saw that they were a design studio that seemed working on some really cool problems!  \n\n\nI reached out to him with a sample of some work that I did and we had a call, where I wanted to learn more about the opportunities that were available.As I had my end of semester break, I realised that maybe I could come for 10 days as a quick “preview” and work on a small aspect of a problem. It would be a win-win situation. They would get some work that was of value to them, while I would gain experience and some stuff that would go on my portfolio (and be paid too)!  \n\n\nI proposed this over the call, and to my surprise and delight, he was interested. He discussed some projects they was working on, and later that day I sent a proposal outlining my various ideas for things that I could contribute to. I worked hard on the proposal, made a case for xyz thing and explained the different ideas I had.  \n\n\nI joined and impressed them enough that they called me back in the summer after my first year, and they offered me a job once my master's got over. I would have probably had zero luck had I waited till my master's was over and applied through their careers page, like everyone else.  \n\n\nI worked for a year there then they got battered by the pandemic so I went in-house at the ad-tech division of a tech company.\n\n### Comment ID hqplp60 with +1 score by [(DevelopMatt, Reddit, 2021-12-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqplp60/) (in reply to ID hqnf8ms):\nGreat story!

Until you have some experience under your belt all you can do is convey what you know and who you are as a person. I believe the best way to do that is still in person. I got my first few jobs in the industry by impressing people at meetups who then told their teams they should hire me. \n\nUnfortunately, the global pandemic makes that a lot harder these days but I would recommend looking up local meetup groups / industry happy hours and local chapters of of groups like IxDA, UXPA, etc. My local groups still do online events about once a month and occasionally do in person during the better Covid times. If there aren’t any in your area I would look into UX discord or slack channels.\n\n### Comment ID hqk7cnc with +1 score by [(DevelopMatt, Reddit, 2021-12-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/rroldx/looking_for_junior_ux_designer_job_where_do_i_look/hqk7cnc/) (in reply to ID hqk4osy):\nGreat points!

Another example was being approached for a copywriter position when the only thing close to that on my resume was that I had InDesign experience.  It's like, really?  You didn't even read the damn thing.  What really puts a recruiter above their peers though is when they spend time asking about my background and career objectives - it's really about building a relationship.  Sadly, too few get this.  I've gone out for coffee with a recruiter I knew nothing about, but they invited me, and the half hour with them was way more productive than any other phone call I've had otherwise.  In a way, it's like finding a normal personal/romantic relationship - you want someone who can adapt to your strengths and weaknesses.  Oh, and the other thing is how well they know the industry they are recruiting for.  I do give some leeway for IT though - understanding that if they were really good enough to completely know, let's say server administration, they probably wouldn't be a recruiter.

I don't listen to regular terrestrial radio anymore, but when I did tune in recently (Q101 maybe?), I was surprised to hear ads for mass recruitment (pyramid schemes, etc.) where anyone with any kind of sense would avoid like the plague.

      "# Post ID 16c0b6p: I used GPT to fetch 40,918 remote jobs with +6199 score by [(alimir1, Reddit, 2023-09-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16c0b6p/i_used_gpt_to_fetch_40918_remote_jobs/)\nI hate job boards. I usually just apply for jobs via company websites. Before GPT, I tried creating a script to fetch jobs and structure them but results were very mediocre because every site has different structure.\n\nWhen I discovered GPT, I was mind blown. Especially now that GPT has native JSON output built in the API.\n\nSo I sat down on a few weekends and created a spreadsheet of 14k companies who are hiring remotely. Then I used GPT API to grab listings and summarize job descriptions.\n\nAfter lots and lots of iterations, I was finally able to create an engine that works great. It’s available for free to job seekers: https://hiring.cafe\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.

Every Internet user is used to them at this point so I don't think there's anything wrong with that. \n\nIt could just be an in-feed ad every 5-10 listings.

You can fetch the user's location and get their city or state, and also get their role from an input. Then you can use Google custom search engine to search for 'role jobs near me', go through all the results HTML and add them to your data, and if it's not a careers or job page, you can check if the page has a link to any of these common career page names: ['career', 'job',...]. That way, you can find more opportunities for the user.\n- And don't forget to take feedback from the community if the job is still available. If not, they can mark it as not available. That will help keep your data up-to-date and accurate.\n- And last but not least, you can also give an option to the user to add an HTML link of their choice, or maybe create a chrome extension that will parse the current careers page of any website and feed more data to your server.\n\nGreat job BTW. 👏🫡\n\n### Comment ID jzh8e50 with +3 score by [(alimir1, Reddit, 2023-09-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16c0b6p/i_used_gpt_to_fetch_40918_remote_jobs/jzh8e50/) (in reply to ID jzgyowp):\nThis is excellent advice. \n\nEspecially re taking feedback from job seekers to keep data fresh.\n\nThank you!\n\n### Comment ID jzjpjfs with +1 score by [(sumethreuaweiei, Reddit, 2023-09-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16c0b6p/i_used_gpt_to_fetch_40918_remote_jobs/jzjpjfs/) (in reply to ID jzgyowp):\nhow do parse the job postings especially when they’re not uniform across websites?\n\n#### Comment ID jzjuag0 with +2 score by [(sherlocksingh, Reddit, 2023-09-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16c0b6p/i_used_gpt_to_fetch_40918_remote_jobs/jzjuag0/) (in reply to ID jzjpjfs):\nI added all my ideas to ChatGPT and it formatted it for me. Here:\n\n1. **Avoid Headers and Footers**: They usually don't have job details.\n2. **Check Specific HTML Tags**: Jobs might be in `<li>`, `<div>`, etc. Titles in `<h1>`, `<h2>`.\n3. **Look at Button/Link Texts**: Words like \"Apply Now\" or \"See Open Positions\" can be hints.\n4. **Meta Info**: Meta tags can give hints about page content.\n5. **Follow Job Links**: If links say \"careers\" or \"open roles\", check them out. They might lead to job pages.\n6. **Sitemaps**: See if the site has a sitemap. It might have direct links to job pages.\n7. **URL Patterns**: Look for patterns like `/jobs/developer`. It can help find job pages faster.\n8. **Job Portal Patterns**: Some sites use platforms like lever, LinkedIn, Greenhouse. Knowing their structure can help.\n9. **Use NLP**: Words like \"requirements\" can indicate job descriptions.\n10. **Google Search Snippets**: From search results, find the snippet text on the page. It can help locate job sections.\n\n## Comment ID jzh70s7 with +5 score by [(im_not, Reddit, 2023-09-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16c0b6p/i_used_gpt_to_fetch_40918_remote_jobs/jzh70s7/) (in reply to ID 16c0b6p):\nthe world needs more people like you.

Where does it lead?\n\nA: When you click the \"Apply Now\" button, you'll be directed to the job application form that the company is using to manage applications. Since many tech companies use similar software to manage applications, you'll notice a similar pattern in the application forms. We make sure that every Apply Now button links to the appropriate application page.\n\nQ: Does HiringCafe collect application data?\n\nA: No, absolutely not! When you apply for a job, your resume and personal information that you input on the job application form are never collected by us. Once you click the \"Apply Now\" button, you will be directed to the company's job application page. We do not have control over what happens after.\n\n## Comment ID jzhp1nx with +1 score by [(rezzort, Reddit, 2023-09-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16c0b6p/i_used_gpt_to_fetch_40918_remote_jobs/jzhp1nx/) (in reply to ID 16c0b6p):\nThat’s amazing.\n\n## Comment ID jzhp3po with +1 score by [(katatondzsentri, Reddit, 2023-09-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16c0b6p/i_used_gpt_to_fetch_40918_remote_jobs/jzhp3po/) (in reply to ID 16c0b6p):\nIs it open source?

My system in the past was to find a job on a board, and then look up that company's website and apply there. I will tell you or anyone that I was getting better results. At least I would get rejections so I know where I stood. \n\nI'll never forget an HR person telling me that a lot of companies treat those job boards as a backup option. Meaning if they have a good number of resumes coming in through their company's website, they won't even look at the resumes that came through those job boards. I have been spreading that word to everyone because it shows how many people are basically wasting their time on these boards beyond just looking for leads. \n\nI will definitely give your site a try should I ever be in the market for a new job. While we can trash on the idea of companies using AI to replace human workers, I like the idea of AI being used in this sense to crawl and find jobs or content, which would take a human much longer to do. \n\nI'm sure we are one day going to see a company try to replace tons of workers with AI, or other companies and content creators take significant steps to prevent AI from using their material as any kind of model or learning item, but it's always the hope that we are also going to see some amazing tools come up to enhance our lives and it won't be at the expense of people losing their livelihood.\n\n## Comment ID jzj478u with +1 score by [(princeajax, Reddit, 2023-09-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16c0b6p/i_used_gpt_to_fetch_40918_remote_jobs/jzj478u/) (in reply to ID 16c0b6p):\nWould love to contribute to this.

I tried LinkedIn, but most jobs posted over 24 hours ago have 200+ applicants. It’s frustrating. I am interviewing with one company, but I am very much a special case with them: they found one of my personal projects and reached out because they are doing the same thing — though they were hiring for a senior position for a framework with which I don’t have experience. They want to see if I can fit on another team, but I’ve been waiting for a while (almost a month) and this is somewhat time sensitive.

Connect with as many people as possible. Having a wider network makes it easier for you to come up in recruiter searches.\n2. Make sure you profile is properly filled in with all the info. More keywords in job descriptions and the \"about me\" section help you come up in recruiter searches.\n3. Make sure you're \"open to work\".\n4. Reply to every recruiter message, even if it's to say \"I don't think this is for me, but if you have xyz I'd be interested in hearing about it\". Replying more puts you higher up in the recruiter searches.\n5. Use the title feature to go with your name for things like \"software dev | framework | yoe\" etc. so people can quickly see what you do (though obviously you can only put a small amount of info here).\n6. I assume that getting skill badges helps. Same with if you can get friends/colleagues to validate your skills too.\n\nObviously there are no guarantees, but this is what I understand to be the things that helps ensure you come up higher in recruiter searches.\n\nIt's\n\n### Comment ID j6iqug5 with +1 score by [(SeeJaneCode, Reddit, 2023-01-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/10oi5sk/where_do_you_all_go_to_find_jobs/j6iqug5/) (in reply to ID j6f3noe):\nThis is the way.

They didn’t even reply then. But two or three years later they all started emailing me at an address that I stopped putting on my resume shortly after applying.

Job posting sites do work, but as you've noted, it can be a serious uphill battle considering how many people use those sites. The numbers are just not in your favor. Through networking, though, you can potentially find positions that aren't easily findable by the public as well as stand out from the crowd through your reference.\n\nYou've even seen this first hand:\n\n>I am interviewing with one company, but I am very much a special case with them: they found one of my personal projects and reached out because they are doing the same thing — though they were hiring for a senior position for a framework with which I don’t have experience.\n\nYou getting that interview was effectively the result of your (passive) networking. Those kinds of opportunities exist all the time, the problem is finding them. By communicating with relevant people, you're searching for these kinds of opportunities more actively. Even if this specific interview doesn't work out for you, they're going to know who you are and what you can do, meaning if they later find a position for you (either with them or for someone else), you're name will be on the top of their list.\n\nThere's a lot to be said about how to effectively network, but I think it's just important to be aware that it's not just an answer, but it's *the* answer. Even using job posting sites can be thought of as a really cheap, but ineffective, way to network. The thing about it is that it takes effort, and you get out what you put in. So if you just go set yourself to \"looking for work\" on LinkedIn and casual check out Indeed, you're not gonna get as many leads as someone who's trying to talk with people, understand what others are looking for, and generally putting themselves out there.\n\nAs far as things being time-sensitive, that's tough. Networking inherently builds on itself and takes time, so the best time to do it is before you need it. Regardless, I'd say finding another contract may be the quickest solution to at least buy more time, although it's not like it's *much* easier. My advice about networking still applies, but I suppose you'd have to be pretty aggressive with your approach if you're trying to get a job ASAP. Reach out to people you know, search for companies that may want to hire you and contact someone relevant directly, and keep trying to expose yourself (and your credentials) to as many people as possible.

My last two jobs came from a recruiter that messaged me on LinkedIn. You can turn on “looking for work” and pay for the LinkedIn premium membership for the duration you are looking for a job.

That is, recruiters employed by the company instead of an agency.  If they are employed by a company, they are actively looking to fill roles.  Reach out on LinkedIn and update your status.

Toxic culture lead by toxic higher ups. 4 layoffs (maybe 5 now with a new one January 2024 that I saw...) and each time there was zero sympathy or explanation. Instead, each layoff added pressure to current employees who then had to triple their work load for no additional pay. One time I heard the CEO tell people in the office that they should get back to work, when they were talking about an INTERNAL committee they were on and tasked with. The office is a graveyard with a requirement to come in even though 90% of the desks are empty and one half of the office doesn't even have the lights on anymore. I hate office days because it is eerily quiet and the days are depressing. CEO and VPs are the definition of toxic. They are always on expensive vacations abroad while everyone else is worked to the bone, and the \"unlimited PTO/ half day Fridays\" are a joke. I never get to take a half day on a Friday because of the added work load, and hands get slapped if you take a day off even if it is for mental health. \n\nDEI is nonexistent.\n\nI do not see the culture or anything about the company improving because the same VPs and higher ups are always safe, who are truly causing the issues. They should be embarrassed but their egos are too big to ever feel that way. \n\nAlso base pay is a joke compared to any other company.",

I was also “quiet hired” to take on additional responsibilities without a raise or promotion. It was very discouraging to discover that Built In is engaged in the very practices it publicly preaches against. \n\nThe work-life balance was terrible. I worked until 10 or 11 most nights and most weekends, too. This was common on my team. We had to keep up with unreasonable KPIs while leaders resisted our attempts to improve processes. \n\nMany of the perks are mostly performative. If you want to use a wellness day to recover from burnout, you have to scramble twice as hard to get set up for your absence. Half-day Fridays are cool in theory, except the majority of my team worked Friday afternoons anyway to keep up with unreasonable workloads. Unlimited PTO apparently does have limits, a colleague was once told that they shouldn’t take more than ~13 days, and it is possible to get written up for “excessive PTO.” \n\nSo the company loves to dangle these perks as differentiators when they lack meaning in practice.\n\nThere have been four layoffs since October 2022. Two public RIFs, a quiet restructuring, and a more recent silent layoff where remaining employees only found out through LinkedIn posts from their impacted colleagues. Despite the writing on the wall, the leadership remains toxically positive, bordering on delusion. At all-hands meetings, the CEO espouses a hustle mentality, insinuating that the grind and a positive attitude will pay off for everyone (except those who were laid off, obviously) and that the company is winning. I’ll never forget when – a few days after the second RIF – the company kicked off the next all-hands with upbeat pop music and the CEO telling the remaining staff to stay off LinkedIn because it was too depressing.\n\nI’m sure there will be a careful response to this review, as there is on all of the others. So I'll proactively say, in regards to pay transparency that would have addressed my pay disparity, the company said \"they were working on it\" for 2 years and eventually rolled out a disappointing, opaque process. And ultimately, they can’t say anything to change my experience – but I’m one of the few who got off easy. Many others are afraid to post their honest accounts of working at Built In out of concern for the NDA signed in exchange for severance during the many layoffs. \n\nMy advice to jobseekers considering a job here? Do NOT buy into the gospel or sacrifice yourself. Negotiate the heck out of your job offer and always remember: you are disposable.",

We’re so glad that you felt connected to your teammates and the people around you. \r\n\r\nAs a recruitment marketing platform, our customers often reside in HR &amp; Talent positions. We have seen great success in hiring folks from the staffing world as they deeply understand our buyer persona and our industry as a whole! That said, Built In has always been committed to hiring top talent, and prioritizes both diversity of thought and experience - especially for roles that manage people.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to build long lasting teams with inspired leaders, and we are proud to share that our employees have an overall average tenure of 3.1 years, with Management at an average tenure of 4.4 Years. Specifically on our Account Management team the average employee tenure is 3.4 years, with a management tenure of 4.9 years. This is well above the industry average, which is something we are incredibly proud of.\r\n\r\nRegarding our Revenue infrastructure, we endeavor to set our teams up for optimal success, and recognize there are always areas for improvement. While we absolutely make mistakes, we make what we believe to be the best decisions based on the information we had at that time. Most importantly, those decisions and changes are always well-intentioned with the Account Manager and customer as the priority. However, what worked years ago, does not always continue to be the best approach. The past 12 months forced us to move swiftly related to territories/books, commission structure and we’re proud of the changes we’ve made in the positive direction the past 6 months to allow for a more equitable and predictable environment.\r\n\r\nThanks again for sharing your thoughts. If you have any additional feedback or suggestions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.",

Last year we introduced an annual Inclusion Survey, dedicated to gathering employee feedback that would shape our annual DEI roadmap. We had over 60% of our employees participate in the survey, and we presented the results during a company-wide meeting including highlighting both our areas of strengths and areas of opportunity. While we are proud of our gender diversity (&gt;50% of our employees identify as women), we recognize we still have work to do to increase our intersectional representation across the business and have initiatives in place within our roadmap to accomplish this goal. \r\n\r\nRegarding our Leadership team, we care deeply about career development at Built In and are grateful that 3 of our 12 (25%) leaders have begun their careers with us as individual contributors and over their tenure have grown into VPs. That said, 75% of our leadership team have 10-15+ years of external experience across Growth, Enterprise, and Fortune 500 companies. \r\n\r\nCommitment to transparent communications is one of the top priorities of our leadership team, which is why we conduct a monthly company-wide meeting to ensure our employees are looped in to our top strategic initiatives and happenings across the business. We encourage employees to submit questions for our Q&amp;A portion of that meeting to ensure they have answers to any outstanding questions and are informed on the topics that are important to them. In addition, we have invested in training for all managers focused on feedback and coaching - it is our expectation that feedback is continuous and based on observable behaviors. We’ll continue to work on driving transparency across all levels of the business and appreciate you taking the time to flag this opportunity for improvement to us.",

          "cons": "I witnessed deceptive and unprincipled practices by upper management and HR on numerous occasions. In particular, Built In's regular practice of bribing people who are leaving to sign a non-disparagement agreement in order to get severance pay should stop you—a person reading Glassdoor reviews—in your tracks. I refused to sign, even though they offered me a month's salary to do so, which is why I am legally able to leave this review. Think about all the people who got laid off (1/4 of their workforce in fall 2022 alone) who needed that money and decided to sign. You're not hearing from them here, which radically juices the company's ratings as an employer. Core values are not taken seriously by leadership. I regularly tried to lead with solutions by \"poking holes and offering ideas to patch them up,\" as they like to say, and was told to put my head down and keep these thoughts to myself. Even easy-to-implement fixes that everyone could agree on were regularly sidelined due politics or personalities. People who don't take the hint here are asked to resign or laid off at the first opportunity. Content leaders don't believe in the expertise of content creators and do not want them to \"do more.\" Despite being told when I was hired that they were looking for someone who would bring new ideas, strategies and processes to the team, they really wanted a cog in a machine who would shovel content through the mill, not someone interested in raising—or even maintaining—quality or standards. DEI at Built In is all talk and no action. As a hiring manager, I struggled to diversify our very homogeneous team, but the candidate pool was very white and male in every one of the 9 or so hires I was directly involved in. I asked HR for help in expanding this pool and they refused, telling me I needed to come up with my own strategies to expand the applicant pool because they were too busy to offer support. Several candidates of color made it to the final round, only to be denied by leaders or HR for not passing the personality test they make candidates take or not having the right disposition, look or \"culture fit.\" In fact, it was an open secret (on my team, at least) that HR is pretty much useless after you're onboarded. Every time I reached out with a \"people team\" issue, HR would take days or weeks to even respond. I repeatedly had to follow up on my own emails just to get a response! The eventual reply was usually to cut and paste sections of the handbook (that I'd obviously already read) or send URLs to outside advice articles (that they'd already asked managers to read). Then they would schedule follow-up meetings with me to see what I had done to fix the issue on my own, filling up my already stuffed calendar with garbage check-ins to clear themselves of accountability. I've literally never had to deal with a less valuable HR group in my nearly two decades in the professional workforce. I witnessed first-hand multiple occasions of the content studio team being undermined or stabbed in the back by petty managers and leaders on the news team and thrown under the bus by a leaderless sales team. I personally tried to create bonds between these teams to create some empathy between them, but eventually gave up in disgust.",

While we can’t address each of your comments effectively in this forum, we do want to touch on a few of them. \r\n \r\nFirst, we echo your kudos for our writers – we agree wholeheartedly that they are talented, passionate, and hardworking!  We are also pleased to hear that you feel you were able to achieve a healthy work-life balance during your time with us.  This is critically important to the leaders of our organization at every level. We were also glad to hear that you found value in the manager training options provided by the People Team, ranging from our Manager CORE training from LifeLabs to our introduction of Paradigm Reach, an on-demand DEI learning tool. \r\n \r\nWe do take exception to your comment that requesting a non-disparagement covenant as a condition of receiving severance pay is somehow inappropriate. Please know that it’s standard practice to include a severance pay offer in a standard separation agreement containing customary terms and conditions, including a non-disparagement covenant.  \r\nWe acknowledge your concern regarding our lack of diversity.  We recognize that we still have work to do and we are working on strategies to diversify the applicant pool so that we can continue our initiative to improve DEI at Built In.\r\n \r\nFinally, we are proud of our managers (especially the individual who managed you during your employment with us), who encourage a variety of opinions and discourse, as well as our HR team for being responsive to the questions and viewpoints of our team. We are disappointed to learn that you feel your ideas were not given appropriate attention. It’s important to us that everyone feels valued for the contributions they bring to work every day!\r\n \r\nWe would like the opportunity to further explore your concerns now that we are aware of them, and we encourage you to reach out any time to our People Team.

This has caused us to take a close look at our own organization.  It is our responsibility to ensure that our company continues to stay strong. Like most companies, we re-forecasted and our Sales reps have a clear path to attainment. \r\n \r\nWith that goal in mind, we were faced with challenging decisions. In October, we made the difficult decision to implement a workforce reduction that impacted 23% of our employees. \r\n \r\nThis was an incredibly hard decision and one that we hoped we would never need to make.  When looking at the impact on the business as a result of this economic downturn, we needed to evaluate current staffing levels and bring them into alignment with the reality of our business needs. Our goal is to make the transition for affected employees as smooth as possible. To do that, every affected employee was offered severance pay, continuation coverage under our health insurance and Modern Health benefits through the end of November, and the ability to keep their company-issued laptop for their job search.",

In the past I have worked for some bad (and I mean bad) companies who truly do not care about their employees. When joining Built In I saw a whole different world than what I was used to. Employee success, culture, wellness, and actual happiness are at the forefront of how Built In treats their employees regardless of the market. I can honestly say I ENJOY working each day, and so do those around me. Keeping a good attitude and drive during a rough market is hard to do and not for everyone, but I am surrounded by people who genuinely care which is so cool.

There is a mean girls, tribe mentality that forces out anyone with real experience. This results in a chaotic strategy and magical thinking. The CEO is convinced that the product is an enterprise offering, but it cannot support large companies. There is also a push to move internationally before the product provides value in US markets.\r\n\r\nExperienced leaders turn over quickly and then they are blamed for the failings of the company. It's a burnout factory where the CEO can't stand it if someone else's ideas are successful. Once you challenge, you are pushed out.\r\n\r\nThe senior sales team is comprised of some of inexperienced sales people who are friends with leadership. \r\n\r\nThe product is old technology and poorly integrated across sites. There is enough technical debt to cripple the platform, but it is never addressed because they are always pursuing shiny objects with no proof that there is market need for the solution.\r\n\r\nPoor planning, lack of strategy and, copycat mentality have resulted in four layoffs over the past 2 years. Even when they promise that it will be the last.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of talk about the company being people first and valuing diversity. It's lip service.\r\n\r\nIf you want to just show up and agree with the leadership, you'll do fine. If you want to get anything done or make an impact, look elsewhere.",

Priorities are constantly changing because there is not a pulse on macro conditions, nor around company or applicant needs. -Rotating leadership positions. Since 2019 there have been at least, count ‘em, 5+ exec (VP and above, including C level ) positions that have left within ~1 year of their start date. Not even counting the numerous 'Director' level positions that have come and gone. Look into median (instead of average) tenure of leadership positions. -Siloed functions. Teams don't work together within their functions, nor do they collaborate across functions. What is product working on? No idea because a product roadmap is not communicated broadly. -Culture. Toxic, plain and simple. Watch out for the most tenured employees, especially in sales and up to the founder and cofounder. Either get in line or prepare to be ostracized. Leading with solutions is a value, but only if it jives with the CEO's agenda. Otherwise, speaking up will mark you for a PIP or for layoffs. -Career progression. Ask HR, there has been a plan for career laddering the last 3 years with no implementation. DE&amp;I is a facade and the team should spend more time focusing on improving culture, community, and investigating employee concerns rather than vanity metrics or responding to these reviews.",

Please know that we do read these, share with leadership, and work collaboratively to make appropriate improvements based on these insights.\r\n\r\nBuilt In has always operated with a people-first mindset, and we agree that there are great, hard working, caring employees who make Built In what it is.\r\n\r\nLike many others, Built In has been impacted by today’s market and the macro economics surrounding the industry. To those employees who were impacted by layoffs, we offered competitive packages, provided resume and interviewing coaching, and offered personal introductions to companies who are hiring. \r\n\r\nWe are doing our best to navigate this new normal and make decisions in the best interest of our people as well as the business.For example, we encourage all of our leaders to manage their teams independently, while cohesively operating under unified values and business practices. What works for one team may not work for another. Which is why we’ve introduced a Flex Work Policy for all of our employees. We offer both Flex Mode and Remote Mode, where you may have the opportunity to work remotely based on your role and function - or enjoy the perks of being in the office on a hybrid schedule. Some departments may choose to designate additional in-office days, but our philosophy is to encourage flexibility to support personal work styles while balancing business needs.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to our leadership, we are proud to have a leadership team with an average tenure of 7.75 years. When you have a group of individuals who work together for that long, it’s natural that friendships form and we’re proud of the deep trust this team has in each other. It allows us to move fast, be innovative, and have deep alignment with our strategic initiatives. The leaders who we’ve brought on board over the last 1-2 years came in for growth and those leaders are not always the type of leaders who can operate in market downturns.  We’re proud of the leaders we have in place and their commitment to supporting and empowering our people is unwavering. \r\n\r\nIf you have additional questions or other concerns you’d like us to address - please feel free to get in touch directly!",

We only wish you would have done so while you were employed with us, as we would have appreciated the opportunity to address these issues directly with you.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to be an organization built and led by women. Individuals who identify as women account for 58% of our employee population, 55% of all managers and 53% of our leadership team. \r\n\r\nWe conducted our first annual anonymous DEI survey in Q4 of 2021 and across the board, women rated our company more favorably than their peers. For example, participants who identified as women gave the following ratings:\r\n- 96% favorability for “I feel respected at Built In,” \r\n- 91% favorability for “I feel like I belong at Built In,”\r\n- 87% favorability for “At Built In there is open and honest two-way communication” \r\n- 81% favorable for “I can voice a contrary opinion without fear of negative consequences” \r\nWe’re disappointed that you don’t feel you had a similar experience while you were employed with us.\r\n\r\nWe take the safety and wellbeing of our employees very seriously. We conduct annual harassment prevention training for all employees and recently invested in a platform that is trauma-informed, trigger free, and provides the most marginalized individuals with additional resources. \r\n\r\nWe have a longstanding written anti-harassment policy that provides multiple reporting avenues.  Again, we wish you had utilized our policy and brought your concerns to our attention during your employment with us, as we would have followed our outlined protocol by asking you to provide the facts underlying your concerns and promptly investigating those concerns. \r\n\r\nWe would like the opportunity to investigate your concerns now that you have made us aware of them, so we encourage you to reach out directly to any member of our People Team so that we can obtain the additional information we need in order to do so.  Thank you again.\r\n\r\nWe’re surprised to hear your comment about a lack of diversity. While we recognize that we have work to do and we are committed to fulfilling the commitments of our annual DEI roadmap, we can confirm that every department in our company has diverse representation.",

Like most tech companies, we were impacted by the most recent market downturn and experienced the need to downsize some of our sales team members. We are in an economic climate that demands constant change of organizations, and our leadership team is dedicated to the success of our people as we emerge stronger than ever before. We continue to invest in developing as people-leaders, as the success of any organization is deeply rooted in the satisfaction and well-being of its employees. \n\nWe take pride in our offerings, and we are disappointed to hear that you found them subpar. We are constantly working to enhance our products and services, and have invested heavily in these by bringing in a Chief Technology Officer and doubling down on R&amp;D to get us to a spot to go international in the near future. We are pleased to say that our products will continue to be enhanced in our pursuit of delivering top results to our tech visitors and customers. \n\nIf you are open to it, we would appreciate the opportunity to discuss your concerns in more detail and gather additional insights that can help us address specific issues. You can reach out directly to our CEO or to our Head of People at any time.  We take all feedback seriously, and your insights are invaluable as we continuously strive to improve our organization.",

In particular, Built In's regular practice of bribing people who are leaving to sign a non-disparagement agreement in order to get severance pay should stop you—a person reading Glassdoor reviews—in your tracks. I refused to sign, even though they offered me a month's salary to do so, which is why I am legally able to leave this review. Think about all the people who got laid off (1/4 of their workforce in fall 2022 alone) who needed that money and decided to sign. You're not hearing from them here, which radically juices the company's ratings as an employer. Core values are not taken seriously by leadership. I regularly tried to lead with solutions by \"poking holes and offering ideas to patch them up,\" as they like to say, and was told to put my head down and keep these thoughts to myself. Even easy-to-implement fixes that everyone could agree on were regularly sidelined due politics or personalities. People who don't take the hint here are asked to resign or laid off at the first opportunity. Content leaders don't believe in the expertise of content creators and do not want them to \"do more.\" Despite being told when I was hired that they were looking for someone who would bring new ideas, strategies and processes to the team, they really wanted a cog in a machine who would shovel content through the mill, not someone interested in raising—or even maintaining—quality or standards. DEI at Built In is all talk and no action. As a hiring manager, I struggled to diversify our very homogeneous team, but the candidate pool was very white and male in every one of the 9 or so hires I was directly involved in. I asked HR for help in expanding this pool and they refused, telling me I needed to come up with my own strategies to expand the applicant pool because they were too busy to offer support. Several candidates of color made it to the final round, only to be denied by leaders or HR for not passing the personality test they make candidates take or not having the right disposition, look or \"culture fit.\" In fact, it was an open secret (on my team, at least) that HR is pretty much useless after you're onboarded. Every time I reached out with a \"people team\" issue, HR would take days or weeks to even respond. I repeatedly had to follow up on my own emails just to get a response! The eventual reply was usually to cut and paste sections of the handbook (that I'd obviously already read) or send URLs to outside advice articles (that they'd already asked managers to read). Then they would schedule follow-up meetings with me to see what I had done to fix the issue on my own, filling up my already stuffed calendar with garbage check-ins to clear themselves of accountability. I've literally never had to deal with a less valuable HR group in my nearly two decades in the professional workforce. I witnessed first-hand multiple occasions of the content studio team being undermined or stabbed in the back by petty managers and leaders on the news team and thrown under the bus by a leaderless sales team. I personally tried to create bonds between these teams to create some empathy between them, but eventually gave up in disgust.",

I was also “quiet hired” to take on additional responsibilities without a raise or promotion. It was very discouraging to discover that Built In is engaged in the very practices it publicly preaches against. \n\nThe work-life balance was terrible. I worked until 10 or 11 most nights and most weekends, too. This was common on my team. We had to keep up with unreasonable KPIs while leaders resisted our attempts to improve processes. \n\nMany of the perks are mostly performative. If you want to use a wellness day to recover from burnout, you have to scramble twice as hard to get set up for your absence. Half-day Fridays are cool in theory, except the majority of my team worked Friday afternoons anyway to keep up with unreasonable workloads. Unlimited PTO apparently does have limits, a colleague was once told that they shouldn’t take more than ~13 days, and it is possible to get written up for “excessive PTO.” \n\nSo the company loves to dangle these perks as differentiators when they lack meaning in practice.\n\nThere have been four layoffs since October 2022. Two public RIFs, a quiet restructuring, and a more recent silent layoff where remaining employees only found out through LinkedIn posts from their impacted colleagues. Despite the writing on the wall, the leadership remains toxically positive, bordering on delusion. At all-hands meetings, the CEO espouses a hustle mentality, insinuating that the grind and a positive attitude will pay off for everyone (except those who were laid off, obviously) and that the company is winning. I’ll never forget when – a few days after the second RIF – the company kicked off the next all-hands with upbeat pop music and the CEO telling the remaining staff to stay off LinkedIn because it was too depressing.\n\nI’m sure there will be a careful response to this review, as there is on all of the others. So I'll proactively say, in regards to pay transparency that would have addressed my pay disparity, the company said \"they were working on it\" for 2 years and eventually rolled out a disappointing, opaque process. And ultimately, they can’t say anything to change my experience – but I’m one of the few who got off easy. Many others are afraid to post their honest accounts of working at Built In out of concern for the NDA signed in exchange for severance during the many layoffs. \n\nMy advice to jobseekers considering a job here?

Once you challenge, you are pushed out.\r\n\r\nThe senior sales team is comprised of some of inexperienced sales people who are friends with leadership. \r\n\r\nThe product is old technology and poorly integrated across sites. There is enough technical debt to cripple the platform, but it is never addressed because they are always pursuing shiny objects with no proof that there is market need for the solution.\r\n\r\nPoor planning, lack of strategy and, copycat mentality have resulted in four layoffs over the past 2 years. Even when they promise that it will be the last.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of talk about the company being people first and valuing diversity. It's lip service.\r\n\r\nIf you want to just show up and agree with the leadership, you'll do fine. If you want to get anything done or make an impact, look elsewhere.",

      "# [14 Dangers of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by Mike Thomas on 2023-02-08](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/risks-of-artificial-intelligence)\nAs AI grows more sophisticated and widespread, the voices warning against the potential dangers of artificial intelligence grow louder.\n\n“These things could get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over, and we need to worry now about how we prevent that happening,” said Geoffrey Hinton, known as the “Godfather of AI” for his foundational work on machine learning and neural network algorithms. In 2023, Hinton left his position at Google so that he could “talk about the dangers of AI,” noting a part of him even regrets his life’s work.\n\nThe renowned computer scientist isn’t alone in his concerns.\n\nTesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, along with over 1,000 other tech leaders, urged in a 2023 open letter to put a pause on large AI experiments, citing that the technology can “pose profound risks to society and humanity.”\n\nWhether it’s the increasing automation of certain jobs, gender and racially biased algorithms or autonomous weapons that operate without human oversight (to name just a few), unease abounds on a number of fronts. And we’re still in the very early stages of what AI is really capable of.\n\n14 Dangers of AI\n\nQuestions about who’s developing AI and for what purposes make it all the more essential to understand its potential downsides. Below we take a closer look at the possible dangers of artificial intelligence and explore how to manage its risks.\n\n1. Lack of AI Transparency and Explainability\n\nAI and deep learning models can be difficult to understand, even for those who work directly with the technology. This leads to a lack of transparency for how and why AI comes to its conclusions, creating a lack of explanation for what data AI algorithms use, or why they may make biased or unsafe decisions. These concerns have given rise to the use of explainable AI, but there’s still a long way before transparent AI systems become common practice.\n\nTo make matters worse, AI companies continue to remain tight-lipped about their products. Former employees of OpenAI and Google DeepMind have accused both companies of concealing the potential dangers of their AI tools. This secrecy leaves the general public unaware of possible threats and makes it difficult for lawmakers to take proactive measures ensuring AI is developed responsibly.\n\n2. Job Losses Due to AI Automation\n\nAI-powered job automation is a pressing concern as the technology is adopted in industries like marketing, manufacturing and healthcare. By 2030, tasks that account for up to 30 percent of hours currently being worked in the U.S. economy could be automated — with Black and Hispanic employees left especially vulnerable to the change — according to McKinsey. Goldman Sachs even states 300 million full-time jobs could be lost to AI automation.\n\n“The reason we have a low unemployment rate, which doesn’t actually capture people that aren’t looking for work, is largely that lower-wage service sector jobs have been pretty robustly created by this economy,” futurist Martin Ford told Built In. With AI on the rise, though, “I don’t think that’s going to continue.”\n\nAs AI robots become smarter and more dexterous, the same tasks will require fewer humans. And while AI is estimated to create 97 million new jobs by 2025, many employees won’t have the skills needed for these technical roles and could get left behind if companies don’t upskill their workforces.\n\n“If you’re flipping burgers at McDonald’s and more automation comes in, is one of these new jobs going to be a good match for you?” Ford said. “Or is it likely that the new job requires lots of education or training or maybe even intrinsic talents — really strong interpersonal skills or creativity — that you might not have? Because those are the things that, at least so far, computers are not very good at.”\n\nAs technology strategist Chris Messina has pointed out, fields like law and accounting are primed for an AI takeover as well. In fact, Messina said, some of them may well be decimated. AI already is having a significant impact on medicine. Law and accounting are next, Messina said, the former being poised for “a massive shakeup.”\n\n“It’s a lot of attorneys reading through a lot of information — hundreds or thousands of pages of data and documents. It’s really easy to miss things,” Messina said. “So AI that has the ability to comb through and comprehensively deliver the best possible contract for the outcome you’re trying to achieve is probably going to replace a lot of corporate attorneys.”\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceAI Copywriting: Why Writing Jobs Are Safe\n\n3. Social Manipulation Through AI Algorithms\n\nSocial manipulation also stands as a danger of artificial intelligence. This fear has become a reality as politicians rely on platforms to promote their viewpoints, with one example being Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., wielding a TikTok troll army to capture the votes of younger Filipinos during the Philippines’ 2022 election.\n\nTikTok, which is just one example of a social media platform that relies on AI algorithms, fills a user’s feed with content related to previous media they’ve viewed on the platform. Criticism of the app targets this process and the algorithm’s failure to filter out harmful and inaccurate content, raising concerns over TikTok’s ability to protect its users from misleading information.\n\nOnline media and news have become even murkier in light of AI-generated images and videos, AI voice changers as well as deepfakes infiltrating political and social spheres. These technologies make it easy to create realistic photos, videos, audio clips or replace the image of one figure with another in an existing picture or video. As a result, bad actors have another avenue for sharing misinformation and war propaganda, creating a nightmare scenario where it can be nearly impossible to distinguish between credible and faulty news.\n\n“No one knows what’s real and what’s not,” Ford said. “You literally cannot believe your own eyes and ears; you can’t rely on what, historically, we’ve considered to be the best possible evidence ... That’s going to be a huge issue.”\n\n4. Social Surveillance With AI Technology\n\nIn addition to its more existential threat, Ford is focused on the way AI will adversely affect privacy and security. A prime example is China’s use of facial recognition technology in offices, schools and other venues. Besides tracking a person’s movements, the Chinese government may be able to gather enough data to monitor a person’s activities, relationships and political views.\n\nAnother example is U.S. police departments embracing predictive policing algorithms to anticipate where crimes will occur. The problem is that these algorithms are influenced by arrest rates, which disproportionately impact Black communities. Police departments then double down on these communities, leading to over-policing and questions over whether self-proclaimed democracies can resist turning AI into an authoritarian weapon.\n\n“Authoritarian regimes use or are going to use it,” Ford said. “The question is, ‘How much does it invade Western countries, democracies, and what constraints do we put on it?’”\n\nRelatedAre Police Robots the Future of Law Enforcement?\n\n5. Lack of Data Privacy Using AI Tools\n\nA 2024 AvePoint survey found that the top concern among companies is data privacy and security. And businesses may have good reason to be hesitant, considering the large amounts of data concentrated in AI tools and the lack of regulation regarding this information.\n\nAI systems often collect personal data to customize user experiences or to help train the AI models you’re using (especially if the AI tool is free). Data may not even be considered secure from other users when given to an AI system, as one bug incident that occurred with ChatGPT in 2023 “allowed some users to see titles from another active user’s chat history.” While there are laws present to protect personal information in some cases in the United States, there is no explicit federal law that protects citizens from data privacy harm caused by AI.\n\nRelated ReadingAI-Generated Content and Copyright Law: What We Know\n\n6. Biases Due to AI\n\nVarious forms of AI bias are detrimental too. Speaking to the New York Times, Princeton computer science professor Olga Russakovsky said AI bias goes well beyond gender and race. In addition to data and algorithmic bias (the latter of which can “amplify” the former), AI is developed by humans — and humans are inherently biased.\n\n“A.I. researchers are primarily people who are male, who come from certain racial demographics, who grew up in high socioeconomic areas, primarily people without disabilities,” Russakovsky said. “We’re a fairly homogeneous population, so it’s a challenge to think broadly about world issues.”\n\nThe narrow views of individuals have culminated in an AI industry that leaves out a range of perspectives. According to UNESCO, only 100 of the world’s 7,000 natural languages have been used to train top chatbots. It doesn’t help that 90 percent of online higher education materials are already produced by European Union and North American countries, further restricting AI’s training data to mostly Western sources.\n\nThe limited experiences of AI creators may explain why speech-recognition AI often fails to understand certain dialects and accents, or why companies fail to consider the consequences of a chatbot impersonating historical figures. If businesses and legislators don’t exercise greater care to avoid recreating powerful prejudices, AI biases could spread beyond corporate contexts and exacerbate societal issues like housing discrimination.\n\n7. Socioeconomic Inequality as a Result of AI\n\nIf companies refuse to acknowledge the inherent biases baked into AI algorithms, they may compromise their DEI initiatives through AI-powered recruiting. The idea that AI can measure the traits of a candidate through facial and voice analyses is still tainted by racial biases, reproducing the same discriminatory hiring practices businesses claim to be eliminating.\n\nWidening socioeconomic inequality sparked by AI-driven job loss is another cause for concern, revealing the class biases of how AI is applied. Workers who perform more manual, repetitive tasks have experienced wage declines as high as 70 percent because of automation, with office and desk workers remaining largely untouched in AI’s early stages. However, the increase in generative AI use is already affecting office jobs, making for a wide range of roles that may be more vulnerable to wage or job loss than others.\n\n8. Weakening Ethics and Goodwill Because of AI\n\nAlong with technologists, journalists and political figures, even religious leaders are sounding the alarm on AI’s potential pitfalls. In a 2023 Vatican meeting and in his message for the 2024 World Day of Peace, Pope Francis called for nations to create and adopt a binding international treaty that regulates the development and use of AI.\n\nPope Francis warned against AI’s ability to be misused, and “create statements that at first glance appear plausible but are unfounded or betray biases.” He stressed how this could bolster campaigns of disinformation, distrust in communications media, interference in elections and more — ultimately increasing the risk of “fueling conflicts and hindering peace.”\n\nThe rapid rise of generative AI tools gives these concerns more substance. Many users have applied the technology to get out of writing assignments, threatening academic integrity and creativity. Plus, biased AI could be used to determine whether an individual is suitable for a job, mortgage, social assistance or political asylum, producing possible injustices and discrimination, noted Pope Francis.\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceWhat Are AI Ethics?\n\n9. Autonomous Weapons Powered By AI\n\nAs is too often the case, technological advancements have been harnessed for warfare. When it comes to AI, some are keen to do something about it before it’s too late: In a 2016 open letter, over 30,000 individuals, including AI and robotics researchers, pushed back against the investment in AI-fueled autonomous weapons.\n\n“The key question for humanity today is whether to start a global AI arms race or to prevent it from starting,” they wrote. “If any major military power pushes ahead with AI weapon development, a global arms race is virtually inevitable, and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious: autonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow.”\n\nThis prediction has come to fruition in the form of Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems, which locate and destroy targets on their own while abiding by few regulations. Because of the proliferation of potent and complex weapons, some of the world’s most powerful nations have given in to anxieties and contributed to a tech cold war.\n\nMany of these new weapons pose major risks to civilians on the ground, but the danger becomes amplified when autonomous weapons fall into the wrong hands. Hackers have mastered various types of cyber attacks, so it’s not hard to imagine a malicious actor infiltrating autonomous weapons and instigating absolute armageddon.\n\nIf political rivalries and warmongering tendencies are not kept in check, artificial intelligence could end up being applied with the worst intentions. Some fear that, no matter how many powerful figures point out the dangers of artificial intelligence, we’re going to keep pushing the envelope with it if there’s money to be made.\n\n“The mentality is, ‘If we can do it, we should try it; let’s see what happens,” Messina said. “‘And if we can make money off it, we’ll do a whole bunch of it.’ But that’s not unique to technology. That’s been happening forever.’”\n\n10. Financial Crises Brought About By AI Algorithms\n\nThe financial industry has become more receptive to AI technology’s involvement in everyday finance and trading processes. As a result, algorithmic trading could be responsible for our next major financial crisis in the markets.\n\nWhile AI algorithms aren’t clouded by human judgment or emotions, they also don’t take into account contexts, the interconnectedness of markets and factors like human trust and fear. These algorithms then make thousands of trades at a blistering pace with the goal of selling a few seconds later for small profits. Selling off thousands of trades could scare investors into doing the same thing, leading to sudden crashes and extreme market volatility.\n\nInstances like the 2010 Flash Crash and the Knight Capital Flash Crash serve as reminders of what could happen when trade-happy algorithms go berserk, regardless of whether rapid and massive trading is intentional.\n\nThis isn’t to say that AI has nothing to offer to the finance world. In fact, AI algorithms can help investors make smarter and more informed decisions on the market. But finance organizations need to make sure they understand their AI algorithms and how those algorithms make decisions. Companies should consider whether AI raises or lowers their confidence before introducing the technology to avoid stoking fears among investors and creating financial chaos.\n\n11. Loss of Human Influence\n\nAn overreliance on AI technology could result in the loss of human influence — and a lack in human functioning — in some parts of society. Using AI in healthcare could result in reduced human empathy and reasoning, for instance. And applying generative AI for creative endeavors could diminish human creativity and emotional expression. Interacting with AI systems too much could even cause reduced peer communication and social skills. So while AI can be very helpful for automating daily tasks, some question if it might hold back overall human intelligence, abilities and need for community.\n\n12. Uncontrollable Self-Aware AI\n\nThere also comes a worry that AI will progress in intelligence so rapidly that it will become sentient, and act beyond humans’ control — possibly in a malicious manner. Alleged reports of this sentience have already been occurring, with one popular account being from a former Google engineer who stated the AI chatbot LaMDA was sentient and speaking to him just as a person would. As AI’s next big milestones involve making systems with artificial general intelligence, and eventually artificial superintelligence, cries to completely stop these developments continue to rise.\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceWhat Is the Eliza Effect?\n\n13. Increased Criminal Activity\n\nAs AI technology has become more accessible, the number of people using it for criminal activity has risen. Online predators can now generate images of children, making it difficult for law enforcement to determine actual cases of child abuse. And even in cases where children aren’t physically harmed, the use of children’s faces in AI-generated images presents new challenges for protecting children’s online privacy and digital safety.\n\nVoice cloning has also become an issue, with criminals leveraging AI-generated voices to impersonate other people and commit phone scams. These examples merely scratch the surface of AI’s capabilities, so it will only become harder for local and national government agencies to adjust and keep the public informed of the latest AI-driven threats.\n\n14. Broader Economic and Political Instability\n\nOverinvesting in a specific material or sector can put economies in a precarious position. Like steel, AI could run the risk of drawing so much attention and financial resources that governments fail to develop other technologies and industries. Plus, overproducing AI technology could result in dumping the excess materials, which could potentially fall into the hands of hackers and other malicious actors.\n\nHow to Mitigate the Risks of AI\n\nAI still has numerous benefits, like organizing health data and powering self-driving cars. To get the most out of this promising technology, though, some argue that plenty of regulation is necessary.\n\n“There’s a serious danger that we’ll get [AI systems] smarter than us fairly soon and that these things might get bad motives and take control,” Hinton told NPR. “This isn’t just a science fiction problem. This is a serious problem that’s probably going to arrive fairly soon, and politicians need to be thinking about what to do about it now.”\n\nDevelop Legal Regulations\n\nAI regulation has been a main focus for dozens of countries, and now the U.S. and European Union are creating more clear-cut measures to manage the rising sophistication of artificial intelligence. In fact, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) published the AI Bill of Rights in 2022, a document outlining to help responsibly guide AI use and development. Additionally, President Joe Biden issued an executive order in 2023 requiring federal agencies to develop new rules and guidelines for AI safety and security.\n\nAlthough legal regulations mean certain AI technologies could eventually be banned, it doesn’t prevent societies from exploring the field.\n\nFord argues that AI is essential for countries looking to innovate and keep up with the rest of the world.\n\n“You regulate the way AI is used, but you don’t hold back progress in basic technology. I think that would be wrong-headed and potentially dangerous,” Ford said. “We decide where we want AI and where we don’t; where it’s acceptable and where it’s not. And different countries are going to make different choices.”\n\nMore on Artificial IntelligenceWill This Election Year Be a Turning Point for AI Regulation?\n\nEstablish Organizational AI Standards and Discussions\n\nOn a company level, there are many steps businesses can take when integrating AI into their operations. Organizations can develop processes for monitoring algorithms, compiling high-quality data and explaining the findings of AI algorithms. Leaders could even make AI a part of their company culture and routine business discussions, establishing standards to determine acceptable AI technologies.\n\nGuide Tech With Humanities Perspectives\n\nThough when it comes to society as a whole, there should be a greater push for tech to embrace the diverse perspectives of the humanities. Stanford University AI researchers Fei-Fei Li and John Etchemendy make this argument in a 2019 blog post that calls for national and global leadership in regulating artificial intelligence:\n\n“The creators of AI must seek the insights, experiences and concerns of people across ethnicities, genders, cultures and socio-economic groups, as well as those from other fields, such as economics, law, medicine, philosophy, history, sociology, communications, human-computer-interaction, psychology, and Science and Technology Studies (STS).”\n\nBalancing high-tech innovation with human-centered thinking is an ideal method for producing responsible AI technology and ensuring the future of AI remains hopeful for the next generation. The dangers of artificial intelligence should always be a topic of discussion, so leaders can figure out ways to wield the technology for noble purposes.\n\n“I think we can talk about all these risks, and they’re very real,” Ford said. “But AI is also going to be the most important tool in our toolbox for solving the biggest challenges we face.”\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

      "# [The Future of AI: How AI Is Changing the World by Mike Thomas on 2022-08-10](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-future)\nInnovations in the field of artificial intelligence continue to shape the future of humanity across nearly every industry. AI is already the main driver of emerging technologies like big data, robotics and IoT, and generative AI has further expanded the possibilities and popularity of AI.\n\nAccording to a 2023 IBM survey, 42 percent of enterprise-scale businesses integrated AI into their operations, and 40 percent are considering AI for their organizations. In addition, 38 percent of organizations have implemented generative AI into their workflows while 42 percent are considering doing so.\n\nWith so many changes coming at such a rapid pace, here’s what shifts in AI could mean for various industries and society at large.\n\nMore on the Future of AICan AI Make Art More Human?\n\nThe Evolution of AI\n\nAI has come a long way since 1951, when the first documented success of an AI computer program was written by Christopher Strachey, whose checkers program completed a whole game on the Ferranti Mark I computer at the University of Manchester. Thanks to developments in machine learning and deep learning, IBM’s Deep Blue defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, and the company’s IBM Watson won Jeopardy! in 2011.\n\nSince then, generative AI has spearheaded the latest chapter in AI’s evolution, with OpenAI releasing its first GPT models in 2018. This has culminated in OpenAI developing its GPT-4o model and ChatGPT, leading to a proliferation of AI generators that can process queries to produce relevant text, audio, images and other types of content.\n\nOther companies have followed suit with competing models of their own, including Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude and DeepSeek’s R1 and V3 models, which made headlines in early 2025 for approaching parity with competing models at a fraction of the operational cost.\n\nAI has also been used to help sequence RNA for vaccines and model human speech, technologies that rely on model- and algorithm-based machine learning and increasingly focus on perception, reasoning and generalization.\n\nHow AI Will Impact the Future\n\nImproved Business Automation\n\nAbout 55 percent of organizations have adopted AI to varying degrees, suggesting increased automation for many businesses in the near future. With the rise of chatbots and digital assistants, companies can rely on AI to handle simple conversations with customers and answer basic queries from employees.\n\nAI’s ability to analyze massive amounts of data and convert its findings into convenient visual formats can also accelerate the decision-making process. Company leaders don’t have to spend time parsing through the data themselves, instead using instant insights to make informed decisions.\n\n“If [developers] understand what the technology is capable of and they understand the domain very well, they start to make connections and say, ‘Maybe this is an AI problem, maybe that’s an AI problem,’” said Mike Mendelson, a learner experience designer for NVIDIA. “That’s more often the case than, ‘I have a specific problem I want to solve.’”\n\nMore on AI75 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Companies to Know\n\nJob Disruption\n\nBusiness automation has naturally led to fears over job losses. In fact, employees believe almost one-third of their tasks could be performed by AI. Although AI has made gains in the workplace, it’s had an unequal impact on different industries and professions. For example, manual jobs like secretaries are at risk of being automated, but the demand for other jobs like machine learning specialists and information security analysts has risen.\n\nWorkers in more skilled or creative positions are more likely to have their jobs augmented by AI, rather than be replaced. Whether forcing employees to learn new tools or taking over their roles, AI is set to spur upskilling efforts at both the individual and company level.\n\n“One of the absolute prerequisites for AI to be successful in many [areas] is that we invest tremendously in education to retrain people for new jobs,” said Klara Nahrstedt, a computer science professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and director of the school’s Coordinated Science Laboratory.\n\nData Privacy Issues\n\nCompanies require large volumes of data to train the models that power generative AI tools, and this process has come under intense scrutiny. Concerns over companies collecting consumers’ personal data have led the FTC to open an investigation into whether OpenAI has negatively impacted consumers through its data collection methods after the company potentially violated European data protection laws.\n\nIn response, the Biden-Harris administration developed an AI Bill of Rights that lists data privacy as one of its core principles. Although this legislation doesn’t carry much legal weight, it reflects the growing push to prioritize data privacy and compel AI companies to be more transparent and cautious about how they compile training data.\n\nIncreased Regulation\n\nAI could shift the perspective on certain legal questions, depending on how generative AI lawsuits unfold in 2024. For example, the issue of intellectual property has come to the forefront in light of copyright lawsuits filed against OpenAI by writers, musicians and companies like The New York Times. These lawsuits affect how the U.S. legal system interprets what is private and public property, and a loss could spell major setbacks for OpenAI and its competitors.\n\nEthical issues that have surfaced in connection to generative AI have placed more pressure on the U.S. government to take a stronger stance. The Biden-Harris administration has maintained its moderate position with its latest executive order, creating rough guidelines around data privacy, civil liberties, responsible AI and other aspects of AI. However, the government could lean toward stricter regulations, depending on changes in the political climate.\n\nClimate Change Concerns\n\nOn a far grander scale, AI is poised to have a major effect on sustainability, climate change and environmental issues. Optimists can view AI as a way to make supply chains more efficient, carrying out predictive maintenance and other procedures to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nAt the same time, AI could be seen as a key culprit in climate change. The energy and resources required to create and maintain AI models could raise carbon emissions by as much as 80 percent, dealing a devastating blow to any sustainability efforts within tech. Even if AI is applied to climate-conscious technology, the costs of building and training models could leave society in a worse environmental situation than before.\n\nAccelerated Speed of Innovation\n\nIn an essay about the future potential of AI, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei hypothesizes that powerful AI technology could speed up research in the biological sciences as much as tenfold, bringing about a phenomenon he coins “the compressed 21st century,” in which 50 to 100 years of innovation might happen in the span of five to 10 years. This theory builds on the idea that truly revolutionary discoveries are made at a rate of maybe once per year, with the core limitation being a shortage of talented researchers. By increasing the cognitive power devoted to developing hypotheses and testing them out, Amodei suggests, we might close the time gap between important discoveries like the 25-year delay between CRISPR’s discovery in the ‘80s and its application to gene editing.\n\nWhat Industries Will AI Impact the Most?\n\nThere’s virtually no major industry that modern AI hasn’t already affected. Here are a few of the industries undergoing the greatest changes as a result of AI.\n\nAI in Manufacturing\n\nManufacturing has been benefiting from AI for years. With AI-enabled robotic arms and other manufacturing bots dating back to the 1960s and 1970s, the industry has adapted well to the powers of AI. These industrial robots typically work alongside humans to perform a limited range of tasks like assembly and stacking, and predictive analysis sensors keep equipment running smoothly.\n\nAI in Healthcare\n\nIt may seem unlikely, but AI healthcare is already changing the way humans interact with medical providers. Thanks to its big data analysis capabilities, AI helps identify diseases more quickly and accurately, speed up and streamline drug discovery and even monitor patients through virtual nursing assistants.\n\nAI in Finance\n\nBanks, insurers and financial institutions leverage AI for a range of applications like detecting fraud, conducting audits and evaluating customers for loans. Traders have also used machine learning’s ability to assess millions of data points at once, so they can quickly gauge risk and make smart investing decisions.\n\nAI in Education\n\nAI in education will change the way humans of all ages learn. AI’s use of machine learning, natural language processing and facial recognition help digitize textbooks, detect plagiarism and gauge the emotions of students to help determine who’s struggling or bored. Both presently and in the future, AI tailors the experience of learning to student’s individual needs.\n\nAI in Media\n\nJournalism is harnessing AI too, and will continue to benefit from it. One example can be seen in The Associated Press’ use of Automated Insights, which produces thousands of earning reports stories per year. But as generative AI writing tools, such as ChatGPT, enter the market, questions about their use in journalism abound.\n\nAI in Customer Service\n\nMost people dread getting a robocall, but AI in customer service can provide the industry with data-driven tools that bring meaningful insights to both the customer and the provider. AI tools powering the customer service industry come in the form of chatbots and virtual assistants.\n\nAI in Transportation\n\nTransportation is one industry that is certainly teed up to be drastically changed by AI. Self-driving cars and AI travel planners are just a couple of facets of how we get from point A to point B that will be influenced by AI. Even though autonomous vehicles are far from perfect, they will one day ferry us from place to place.\n\nRisks and Dangers of AI\n\nDespite reshaping numerous industries in positive ways, AI still has flaws that leave room for concern. Here are a few potential risks of artificial intelligence.\n\nJob Losses\n\nBetween 2023 and 2028, 44 percent of workers’ skills will be disrupted. Not all workers will be affected equally — women are more likely than men to be exposed to AI in their jobs. Combine this with the fact that there is a gaping AI skills gap between men and women, and women seem much more susceptible to losing their jobs. If companies don’t have steps in place to upskill their workforces, the proliferation of AI could result in higher unemployment and decreased opportunities for those of marginalized backgrounds to break into tech.\n\nHuman Biases\n\nThe reputation of AI has been tainted with a habit of reflecting the biases of the people who train the algorithmic models. For example, facial recognition technology has been known to favor lighter-skinned individuals, discriminating against people of color with darker complexions. If researchers aren’t careful in rooting out these biases early on, AI tools could reinforce these biases in the minds of users and perpetuate social inequalities.\n\nDeepfakes and Misinformation\n\nThe spread of deepfakes threatens to blur the lines between fiction and reality, leading the general public to question what’s real and what isn’t. And if people are unable to identify deepfakes, the impact of misinformation could be dangerous to individuals and entire countries alike. Deepfakes have been used to promote political propaganda, commit financial fraud and place students in compromising positions, among other use cases.\n\nData Privacy\n\nTraining AI models on public data increases the chances of data security breaches that could expose consumers’ personal information. Companies contribute to these risks by adding their own data as well. A 2024 Cisco survey found that 48 percent of businesses have entered non-public company information into generative AI tools and 69 percent are worried these tools could damage their intellectual property and legal rights. A single breach could expose the information of millions of consumers and leave organizations vulnerable as a result.\n\nAutomated Weapons\n\nThe use of AI in automated weapons poses a major threat to countries and their general populations. While automated weapons systems are already deadly, they also fail to discriminate between soldiers and civilians. Letting artificial intelligence fall into the wrong hands could lead to irresponsible use and the deployment of weapons that put larger groups of people at risk.\n\nSuperior Intelligence\n\nNightmare scenarios depict what’s known as the technological singularity, where superintelligent machines take over and permanently alter human existence through enslavement or eradication. Even if AI systems never reach this level, they can become more complex to the point where it’s difficult to determine how AI makes decisions at times.

      "# [AI in Healthcare: Uses, Examples & Benefits by Sam Daley on 2022-06-10](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-healthcare)\nArtificial intelligence simplifies the lives of patients, doctors and hospital administrators by performing tasks that are typically done by humans, but in less time and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nAI in healthcare shows up in a number of ways, such as finding new links between genetic codes, powering surgery-assisting robots, automating administrative tasks, personalizing treatment options and much more.\n\nPut simply, AI is reinventing — and reinvigorating — modern healthcare through machines that can predict, comprehend, learn and act.\n\nWhat Is AI in Healthcare?\n\nAI in healthcare refers to the use of machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning and other AI technologies to enhance the experiences of both healthcare professionals and patients. The data-processing and predictive capabilities of AI enable health professionals to better manage their resources and take a more proactive approach to various aspects of healthcare.\n\nWith these technologies, doctors can then make quicker and more accurate diagnoses, health administrators can locate electronic health records faster and patients can receive more timely and personalized treatments.\n\nExamples of AI in Healthcare\n\nTo give you a better understanding of the rapidly evolving field, we rounded up some examples and use cases of AI in healthcare.\n\nAI in Medical Diagnosis\n\nEvery year, roughly 400,000 hospitalized patients suffer preventable harm, with 100,000 deaths. In light of that, the promise of improving the diagnostic process is one of AI’s most exciting healthcare applications. Incomplete medical histories and large caseloads can lead to deadly human errors. Immune to those variables, AI can predict and diagnose disease at a faster rate than most medical professionals.\n\nAI in Drug Discovery\n\nThe drug development industry is bogged down by skyrocketing development costs and research that takes thousands of human hours. Putting each drug through clinical trials costs an estimated average of $1.3 billion, and only 10 percent of those drugs are successfully brought to market. Due to breakthroughs in technology, AI is speeding up this process by helping design drugs, predicting any side effects and identifying ideal candidates for clinical trials.\n\nAI in Patient Experience\n\nAI can be used to support digital communications, offering schedule reminders, tailored health tips and suggested next steps to patients. The ability of AI to aid in health diagnoses also improves the speed and accuracy of patient visits, leading to faster and more personalized care. And efficiently providing a seamless patient experience allows hospitals, clinics and physicians to treat more patients on a daily basis.\n\nAI in Healthcare Data Management\n\nHighly valuable information can sometimes get lost among the forest of trillions of data points. Additionally, the inability to connect important data points slows the development of new drugs, preventative medicine and proper diagnosis. Because of its ability to handle massive volumes of data, AI breaks down data silos and connects in minutes information that used to take years to process. This can reduce the time and costs of healthcare administrative processes, contributing to more efficient daily operations and patient experiences.\n\nAI in Robotic Surgery\n\nHospitals use AI and robots to help with everything from minimally invasive procedures to open heart surgery. Surgeons can control a robot’s mechanical arms while seated at a computer console as the robot gives the doctor a three-dimensional, magnified view of the surgical site. The surgeon then leads other team members who work closely with the robot through the entire operation. Robot-assisted surgeries have led to fewer surgery-related complications, less pain and a quicker recovery time.\n\nCompanies Using AI in Healthcare\n\nThese are some of the companies paving the way for healthcare innovation by applying AI technology.\n\nLocation: New York, New York\n\nEliseAI specializes in conversational AI solutions.

      "# [Unconscious Bias: Definition and Examples by Bailey Reiners on 2023-02-08](https://builtin.com/diversity-inclusion/unconscious-bias-examples)\nUnconscious bias, or implicit bias, describes a subconscious attitude that affects the way individuals feel and think about others around them. Subconscious attitudes aren’t necessarily as well-formed as coherent thoughts, but they can be very ingrained and impact the emotional and rational responses of individuals in everyday situations.\n\nWhat Is Unconscious Bias?\n\nUnconscious bias refers to a prejudice or stereotype an individual may hold about a particular group of people that they aren’t fully aware of. Also known as implicit bias, this bias can be directed toward people of certain races, gender identities, sexual orientations, physical abilities or even personal traits.\n\nBiases and prejudices often develop in early childhood as children begin to make assumptions based on personal experiences. They may also receive stereotypes from parents, education systems and other cultural institutions, as well as from popular forms of media such as books, movies and television. As a result, unconscious biases can be forged over many years while going undetected.\n\nSome of the most common types of unconscious biases are in how individuals regard their own thought processes and reasoning abilities, such as focusing on negative qualities of individuals that align with one’s existing attitudes — like in confirmation bias and affirmation bias.\n\nOther unconscious biases are directly related to how other people may look. These types of biases tend to rely on stereotypes and can result in discriminatory practices when people are not treated like individuals, such as racism, ageism and beauty bias.\n\n18 Examples of Unconscious Bias in the Workplace\n\nWe’ve identified 18 types of unconscious bias that commonly affect candidates and employees, and also provided some tips for how to avoid them when hiring and retaining employees.\n\n1. Affinity Bias\n\nAffinity bias, also known as similarity bias, is the tendency people have to connect with others who share similar interests, experiences and backgrounds.\n\nWhen companies hire for “culture fit,” they are likely falling prey to affinity bias. When hiring teams meet someone they like and who they know will get along with the team, it’s more often than not because that person shares similar interests, experiences and backgrounds, which is not helping your team grow and diversify. While similarities shouldn’t automatically disqualify a candidate, they should never be the deciding factor, either.\n\nHow to Avoid Affinity Bias\n\nTo avoid affinity bias, actively take note of the similarities you share with the candidate so that you can differentiate between attributes that may cloud your judgment and the concrete skills, experiences and unique qualities that would contribute to your team as a “culture add” rather than “culture fit.”\n\n2. Ageism\n\nAgeism in the workplace is the tendency to have negative feelings about another person based on their age.\n\nAgeism affects older people more often than younger people. About two-thirds of workers aged 50 and over believe older employees face discrimination because of their age. The later employees are in their careers, the more difficult it is to change careers, find a job or move up in their careers because employers tend to value younger talent — even though experience and expertise are critical skills for any successful business.\n\nHow to Avoid Ageism\n\nTo avoid ageism in the workplace, train your team members to understand the issue of ageism and debunk some of the myths about workers of different ages. Your company should also create a policy that prevents age bias along with hiring goals to keep age diversity top of mind when recruiting new talent.\n\n3. Anchor Bias\n\nAnchor bias, or expectation anchor bias, is when someone holds onto an initial, singular piece of information to make decisions.\n\nAnchor bias commonly occurs in the hiring process while comparing candidates. A recruiter may see one aspect of a candidate and then cannot “unsee” that characteristic while considering other applicants. For example, the first applicant a recruiter considers may request a significantly lower salary than the following candidates. This can create an expectation anchor bias that the latter candidates are asking for too much.\n\nHow to Avoid Anchor Bias\n\nTo avoid anchor bias, try to compare every aspect of a candidate and never rely on one singular piece of information as a deciding factor. If you find yourself coming back to one piece of information you’re comparing against, try omitting that anchoring piece of information and comparing candidates based on their other characteristics and qualifications.\n\n4. Attribution Bias\n\nAttribution bias is a phenomenon where you try to make sense of or judge a person’s behavior based on prior observations and interactions you’ve had with that individual that make up your perception of them.\n\nWhile this may seem harmless, humans are quick to judge and falsely assume things about a person without knowing their full story. When hiring, attribution bias can cause hiring managers and recruiters to determine a candidate unfit for the job because of something unusual on their resume or unexpected behavior during the interview.\n\nHow to Avoid Attribution Bias\n\nRather than assume a candidate is unfit for a job because they were late to the interview, ask them what happened — it could be totally innocent and unprecedented. If there is something on their resume or something they said during the interview that caused you to draw conclusions about the candidate, ask them further clarifying questions. Don’t forget that interviewees are often nervous and may misspeak or stumble. Give them a chance to share their full story with you before you judge.\n\n5. Authority Bias\n\nAuthority bias refers to when an idea or opinion is given more attention or thought to be more accurate because it was provided by an authority figure.\n\nAuthority bias is very easy to find in the workplace because hierarchies are already in place. Existing hierarchies make it incredibly easy to simply follow the leader, even if the leader’s ideas aren’t what is best for the company or their employees. But putting too much trust and power in leadership roles can limit employee engagement, hinder employees’ professional growth and ultimately damage a company’s ability to innovate.\n\nHow to Avoid Authority Bias\n\nAvoiding authority bias can be difficult depending on the culture of a workplace. One of the best ways to avoid this bias is to foster an environment of ideas, where others speak up and voice their own opinions and ideas.\n\n6. Beauty Bias\n\nBeauty bias is a social behavior where people believe that those they perceive as attractive are more successful, competent and qualified.\n\nWhile appearance (race aside) is not protected by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, it is a form of bias that is prominent in the workplace. Many people connect conventional beauty to higher levels of intelligence, social skills and physical health. Workers considered physically attractive can go on to earn up to 15 percent more than workers considered less physically attractive. At the same time, candidates considered physically attractive may also be discriminated against by hiring teams due to perceived entitlement.\n\nHow to Avoid Beauty Bias\n\nTo avoid beauty bias, companies should create structured recruiting and interview processes so that your team will be able to compare applications and interviews equally and reduce the risk of bias. Phone screenings (as opposed to video calls) and unbiased technologies can also help teams identify top candidates.\n\n7. Confirmation Bias\n\nConfirmation bias is the inclination to draw conclusions about a situation or person based on your personal desires, beliefs and prejudices rather than on unbiased merit.\n\nIn hiring, confirmation bias often plays a detrimental role at the very beginning of the process when you first review a resume and form an initial opinion of the candidate based on inconsequential attributes like their name, where they’re from, where they went to school and so forth. This opinion can follow you into the interview process and consequently steer questions to confirm the initial opinion of the candidate.\n\nHow to Avoid Confirmation Bias\n\nWhile every interview will lend itself to a unique conversation based on the individual’s background, it’s important to ask standardized, skills-based questions that provide each candidate with a fair chance to stand out. This will help prevent your team from asking too many off-the-cuff questions that may lead to confirmation bias.\n\n8. Conformity Bias\n\nConformity bias, more commonly known as peer pressure, is the tendency people have to act similar to the people around them regardless of their own personal beliefs or idiosyncrasies.\n\nWhen your hiring team gets together to review a candidate’s application materials and conduct the interview, conformity bias can cause individuals to sway their opinion of a candidate to match the opinion of the majority. The problem is the majority is not always right, which may cause your team to miss out on an excellent candidate because individual opinions become muddled in a group setting.\n\nHow to Avoid Conformity Bias\n\nBefore you get your hiring team together to review a candidate, have them all write down and submit their individual opinions separate from one another immediately after the interview ends. Then have your team come together and review what everyone wrote down so you can hear their impartial opinions and avoid conformity bias in the process.\n\n9. Contrast Effect\n\nThe contrast effect is when you compare two or more things that you have come into contact with — either simultaneously or one after another — causing you to exaggerate the performance of one in contrast to the other.\n\nThis one is a bit of a mind-bender, but it’s also one of the most common types of bias in the recruiting industry. When you’re reviewing loads of candidates, it can be easy to compare one application to the next in the stack and determine which one is better than the other. An exceptionally good interview with one candidate may make the next one seem terrible.\n\nHow to Avoid the Contrast Effect\n\nTo avoid the contrast effect, create a structured applicant review and interview process so that your team will be able to compare applications and interview answers as apples-to-apples rather than apples-to-oranges. This also goes for performance reviews and rewards for individual employees.\n\n10. Gender Bias\n\nGender bias is the tendency to prefer one gender over another gender.\n\nToo often men are given preferential treatment over women in the workplace. According to Lean In’s Women in the Workplace study, women only occupy about 25 percent of C-suite executive positions, and for every 100 men promoted from entry-level to manager roles, only 87 women are promoted.\n\nHow to Avoid Gender Bias\n\nAvoid gender bias by conducting anonymous screenings of applications that exclude aspects of a candidate that may reveal their assumed gender, like name and interests. Set diversity hiring goals to ensure your company holds itself accountable to equitable hiring practices. And again, make sure to compare candidates based on skill and merit rather than traits that can cloud your judgment of them.\n\n11. Halo Effect\n\nThe halo effect is the tendency people have to place another person on a pedestal after learning something impressive about them.\n\nThe halo effect can come into play at any stage of the hiring process. You may see a candidate worked at a highly regarded company or graduated from an elite school, but if there’s anything we’ve learned about the 2019 college admissions scandal, it’s to not judge a candidate on the merit of their name-brand education.\n\nHow to Avoid the Halo Effect\n\nThe halo effect can be dangerously blinding when it comes to reviewing candidates, but it can be avoided. When reviewing a stack of applications, you are probably looking for something unique that makes a candidate stand out from the rest. When you do this, also consider the candidate without that one gleaming attribute and see how their experiences, skills and personalities compare to other candidates who may not have had the same privileges or opportunities.\n\n12. Height Bias\n\nHeight bias or heightism is the tendency to judge a person who is significantly short or tall.\n\nThis may seem a bit far-fetched, but one study found that one’s annual earnings can increase up to 13 percent with an additional centimeter in height. Another study found that tall candidates are perceived as more competent, employable and healthy, which may explain why 58 percent of male CEOs at major companies are over six feet tall.\n\nHow to Avoid Height Bias\n\nConducting anonymous interviews, phone interviews or video interviews will reduce your susceptibility to judge a person based on their height. Also, simply knowing that this bias is a common social behavior will help you identify your bias against candidates.\n\n13. Horn Effect\n\nThe horn effect is the tendency people have to view another person negatively after learning something unpleasant or negative about them.\n\nThe direct opposite of the halo effect, the horn effect can cause hiring teams to weed out candidates based on a trait that is averse to the team’s preferences. This could be something as trivial as the candidate working with a company you personally dislike or the candidate displaying a particular quirk or mannerism during the interview. Such traits may alter your perception of the candidate entirely even though it’s a small factor that may not even be relevant.\n\nHow to Avoid the Horn Effect\n\nIf you have a negative feeling about a candidate, take the time to figure out exactly where that gut feeling is coming from. It may be something superficial or insignificant that shouldn’t affect their chance at the role. You may also want to check with the rest of the interviewing team to understand the root of their opinions and preferences about a candidate.\n\n14. Name Bias\n\nName bias is the tendency people have to judge and prefer people with certain types of names — typically names that are of Anglo origin.\n\nThis is one of the most pervasive examples of unconscious bias in the hiring process, and the numbers bear it out.One study found that white names receive significantly more callbacks for interviews than Black names. Another study found that Asian last names are 28 percent less likely to receive a callback for an interview compared to Anglo last names.\n\nHow to Avoid Name Bias\n\nName bias can be avoided if you omit the candidate’s name and personal information — like email, phone number and address — from their application materials. You can either do this by assigning candidates a number or have an unbiased third-party team member omit this information for the hiring team until they bring a candidate in to interview. This will ensure that hiring teams are selecting candidates based on their skills and experiences without the influence of irrelevant personal information.\n\n15. Nonverbal Bias\n\nNonverbal bias is analyzing nonverbal communication attributes such as body language and letting it affect a decision or opinion.\n\nWhen you meet a candidate for an interview, nonverbal bias can creep in. Whether it’s a weak handshake, folded arms or difficulty holding eye contact, it’s easy to take these cues as disinterest, overconfidence or an overall negative attitude. It’s important to remember that the way a person moves through the world is not indicative of their true intentions or whether they will be a successful addition to your team or not.\n\nHow to Avoid Nonverbal Bias\n\nRemember that everyone is different — this includes their mannerisms and ways of communicating physically. For example, if a candidate keeps their arms crossed in an interview, perhaps it’s simply a nervous response. You can teach someone to uncross their arms, but that doesn’t mean they will bring the necessary skills to their position.\n\n16. Overconfidence Bias\n\nThe overconfidence bias refers to a person’s tendency to be more confident in their capabilities than they should be.\n\nOverconfidence bias may not lead to the kinds of hiring and recruiting issues other biases cause, but it can create conflict within an organization and cause a company to not live up to its potential. When overconfidence bias is allowed to flow freely, companies or employees with this bias do not believe they need to make improvements, thus affecting their own growth as well as the company’s growth.\n\nHow to Avoid Overconfidence Bias\n\nOne way to avoid overconfidence bias is to continue your work on affinity bias and hire a diverse team that doesn’t fall into the groupthink trap. It will be more difficult for overconfidence to take over if you foster a diverse and challenging environment.\n\n17. Status Quo Bias\n\nStatus quo bias is a preference for things to remain the way they are and a resistance to change.\n\nFor example, employees who are used to working with a specific software platform may object to the company’s decision to implement a more advanced platform with simpler workflows. If companies don’t establish a culture that accepts change, it only becomes harder to adopt new technologies and stay ahead of the competition.\n\nHow to Avoid Status Quo Bias\n\nDeveloping a culture of innovation can help you avoid status quo bias. In this environment, employees can feel more comfortable experimenting with different ideas and new tools and workflows. If larger organizational changes are occurring, company leaders can emphasize the benefits of the change to frame it in a more positive way for employees.\n\n18. Illusory Correlation\n\nIllusory correlation refers to thinking there’s a connection between two variables when there’s no evidence to back up this claim.\n\nThis kind of bias can go hand-in-hand with stereotyping employees in the workplace. For example, say a manager has a negative experience with an employee of a particular ethnic background. That manager may then make an illusory correlation and falsely assume they’ll have a negative experience with employees of the same ethnic background.\n\nHow to Avoid Illusory Correlation\n\nEducate employees on this type of bias and how it can fuel false assumptions. DEI and bias training focused on stereotypes can be an effective method to help workers become more aware of this bias.\n\nHow to Reduce and Prevent Unconscious Bias\n\nTo seriously address unconscious biases, commit to some long-term strategies. The following ideas enable businesses to cultivate more welcoming workplaces that a wider range of candidates will want to join.\n\n1. Unconscious Bias Training\n\nEducation is an important step in becoming more aware of unconscious biases. Conduct unconscious bias training programs to teach employees how factors like language can alienate candidates and coworkers. Training sessions are also an excellent opportunity to set expectations for how leaders should enforce diverse, equitable and inclusive practices going forward.\n\n2. Diversity Hiring Goals\n\nSeek out diverse sources of talent by opening up positions to remote candidates, which broadens the candidate pool to include people of varying life experiences, and targeting historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs).\n\n3. Talent Assessments and Candidate Scorecards\n\nDevelop objective interview and hiring methods. Talent assessments and interview scorecards create a common structure for grading all candidates, which ensures interviews stay the course and don’t dive too deep into candidates’ personal backgrounds.\n\n4. Different Interview Techniques and Formats\n\nDiversify your interview tactics and formats to make your interview process less prone to bias. Phone interviews are a great way to prevent beauty bias from influencing recruiting decisions. A common set of pre-interview questions is another interview technique that creates a more standard, less biased interview setup.\n\n5. Diverse and Inclusive Culture\n\nAddressing unconscious biases is just one of the many DEI initiatives companies should be investing in. Leaders should collaborate with HR to develop guidelines and policies that serve as the foundation for a diverse and inclusive culture. This is a more holistic approach that proves DEI is a permanent part of a company’s identity, not just a catchphrase.\n\nImportance of Addressing Unconscious Biases\n\nAcknowledging and resolving unconscious biases can help improve many aspects of an organization, from recruiting to retention.\n\nStronger Recruiting\n\nAccording to a 2023 Pew Research survey, 78 percent of Black workers and 61 percent of workers who are women believe focusing on DEI in the workplace is a good thing. If a company has a good track record when it comes to DEI initiatives, job seekers of marginalized groups may want to join.\n\nMore Career Advancement\n\nFor every 100 men promoted from an entry-level position to a manager role, 87 women received a promotion, and this number falls to 73 for women of color. Giving employees of various backgrounds the support they need to thrive in the workplace may lead them to stick around longer.\n\nInnovation and Productivity\n\nA 2023 McKinsey report found that companies with the most women representation and ethnic diversity were 39 percent more likely to outperform companies with the least women representation and ethnic diversity. Diverse teams often display a range of perspectives, leading to the exchange of more ideas and creative solutions that give a business a competitive edge.\n\nHealthy Work Environment\n\nLetting unconscious biases fester can lead to outright discrimination and create a hostile workplace, potentially pushing employees of marginalized identities out of the company. By contrast, a healthy work environment is one where workers have awareness of — and ultimately address — their unconscious biases.\n\nIncreased Employee Engagement\n\nA bias-filled workplace can become a toxic workplace, where employees are exposed to bullying and harassment. This can have devastating consequences for employees’ mental health. Companies that take steps to address unconscious biases can protect employees and show them they’re appreciated. In return, employees will feel more motivated to work hard, contributing to higher levels of employee engagement.\n\nImproved Retention\n\nIf company leadership lets unconscious biases drive harmful behavior, employees may decide a change of scenery is needed. A 2023 INTOO study found that over a third of workers would take a pay cut to leave a toxic work environment for a less toxic one. Organizations that proactively tackle unconscious biases and negative actions can cultivate safer and more positive work environments, making it easier to retain employees.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",
      "# [Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Explained by Zakaria Jaadi on 2021-04-01](https://builtin.com/data-science/step-step-explanation-principal-component-analysis)\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is a widely covered machine learning method on the web. And while there are some great articles about it, many go into too much detail. Below we cover how principal component analysis works in a simple step-by-step way, so everyone can understand it and make use of it — even those without a strong mathematical background.\n\nPrincipal component analysis can be broken down into five steps. I’ll go through each step, providing logical explanations of what PCA is doing and simplifying mathematical concepts such as standardization, covariance, eigenvectors and eigenvalues without focusing on how to compute them.\n\nFirst, some basic (and brief) background is necessary for context.\n\nWhat Is Principal Component Analysis?\n\nPrincipal component analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.\n\nReducing the number of variables of a data set naturally comes at the expense of accuracy, but the trick in dimensionality reduction is to trade a little accuracy for simplicity. Because smaller data sets are easier to explore and visualize, and thus make analyzing data points much easier and faster for machine learning algorithms without extraneous variables to process.\n\nSo, to sum up, the idea of PCA is simple: reduce the number of variables of a data set, while preserving as much information as possible.\n\nWhat Are Principal Components?\n\nPrincipal components are new variables that are constructed as linear combinations or mixtures of the initial variables. These combinations are done in such a way that the new variables (i.e., principal components) are uncorrelated and most of the information within the initial variables is squeezed or compressed into the first components. So, the idea is 10-dimensional data gives you 10 principal components, but PCA tries to put maximum possible information in the first component, then maximum remaining information in the second and so on, until having something like shown in the scree plot below.\n\nOrganizing information in principal components this way will allow you to reduce dimensionality without losing much information, and this by discarding the components with low information and considering the remaining components as your new variables.\n\nAn important thing to realize here is that the principal components are less interpretable and don’t have any real meaning since they are constructed as linear combinations of the initial variables.\n\nGeometrically speaking, principal components represent the directions of the data that explain a maximal amount of variance, that is to say, the lines that capture most information of the data. The relationship between variance and information here, is that, the larger the variance carried by a line, the larger the dispersion of the data points along it, and the larger the dispersion along a line, the more information it has. To put all this simply, just think of principal components as new axes that provide the best angle to see and evaluate the data, so that the differences between the observations are better visible.\n\nHow PCA Constructs the Principal Components\n\nAs there are as many principal components as there are variables in the data, principal components are constructed in such a manner that the first principal component accounts for the largest possible variance in the data set. For example, let’s assume that the scatter plot of our data set is as shown below, can we guess the first principal component ? Yes, it’s approximately the line that matches the purple marks because it goes through the origin and it’s the line in which the projection of the points (red dots) is the most spread out. Or mathematically speaking, it’s the line that maximizes the variance (the average of the squared distances from the projected points (red dots) to the origin).\n\nThe second principal component is calculated in the same way, with the condition that it is uncorrelated with (i.e., perpendicular to) the first principal component and that it accounts for the next highest variance.\n\nThis continues until a total of p principal components have been calculated, equal to the original number of variables.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation of PCA\n\nStep 1: Standardization\n\nThe aim of this step is to standardize the range of the continuous initial variables so that each one of them contributes equally to the analysis.\n\nMore specifically, the reason why it is critical to perform standardization prior to PCA, is that the latter is quite sensitive regarding the variances of the initial variables. That is, if there are large differences between the ranges of initial variables, those variables with larger ranges will dominate over those with small ranges (for example, a variable that ranges between 0 and 100 will dominate over a variable that ranges between 0 and 1), which will lead to biased results. So, transforming the data to comparable scales can prevent this problem.\n\nMathematically, this can be done by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each value of each variable.\n\nOnce the standardization is done, all the variables will be transformed to the same scale.\n\nStep 2: Covariance Matrix Computation\n\nThe aim of this step is to understand how the variables of the input data set are varying from the mean with respect to each other, or in other words, to see if there is any relationship between them. Because sometimes, variables are highly correlated in such a way that they contain redundant information. So, in order to identify these correlations, we compute the covariance matrix.\n\nThe covariance matrix is a p × p symmetric matrix (where p is the number of dimensions) that has as entries the covariances associated with all possible pairs of the initial variables. For example, for a 3-dimensional data set with 3 variables x, y, and z, the covariance matrix is a 3×3 data matrix of this from:\n\nSince the covariance of a variable with itself is its variance (Cov(a,a)=Var(a)), in the main diagonal (Top left to bottom right) we actually have the variances of each initial variable. And since the covariance is commutative (Cov(a,b)=Cov(b,a)), the entries of the covariance matrix are symmetric with respect to the main diagonal, which means that the upper and the lower triangular portions are equal.\n\nWhat do the covariances that we have as entries of the matrix tell us about the correlations between the variables?\n\nIt’s actually the sign of the covariance that matters:\n\nIf positive then: the two variables increase or decrease together (correlated)\n\nIf negative then: one increases when the other decreases (Inversely correlated)\n\nNow that we know that the covariance matrix is not more than a table that summarizes the correlations between all the possible pairs of variables, let’s move to the next step.\n\nStep 3: Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix to identify the principal components\n\nEigenvectors and eigenvalues are the linear algebra concepts that we need to compute from the covariance matrix in order to determine the principal components of the data.\n\nWhat you first need to know about eigenvectors and eigenvalues is that they always come in pairs, so that every eigenvector has an eigenvalue. Also, their number is equal to the number of dimensions of the data. For example, for a 3-dimensional data set, there are 3 variables, therefore there are 3 eigenvectors with 3 corresponding eigenvalues.\n\nIt is eigenvectors and eigenvalues who are behind all the magic of principal components because the eigenvectors of the Covariance matrix are actually the directions of the axes where there is the most variance (most information) and that we call Principal Components. And eigenvalues are simply the coefficients attached to eigenvectors, which give the amount of variance carried in each Principal Component.\n\nBy ranking your eigenvectors in order of their eigenvalues, highest to lowest, you get the principal components in order of significance.\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis Example:\n\nLet’s suppose that our data set is 2-dimensional with 2 variables x,y and that the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are as follows:\n\nIf we rank the eigenvalues in descending order, we get λ1>λ2, which means that the eigenvector that corresponds to the first principal component (PC1) is v1 and the one that corresponds to the second principal component (PC2) is v2.\n\nAfter having the principal components, to compute the percentage of variance (information) accounted for by each component, we divide the eigenvalue of each component by the sum of eigenvalues. If we apply this on the example above, we find that PC1 and PC2 carry respectively 96 percent and 4 percent of the variance of the data.\n\nStep 4: Create a Feature Vector\n\nAs we saw in the previous step, computing the eigenvectors and ordering them by their eigenvalues in descending order, allow us to find the principal components in order of significance. In this step, what we do is, to choose whether to keep all these components or discard those of lesser significance (of low eigenvalues), and form with the remaining ones a matrix of vectors that we call Feature vector.\n\nSo, the feature vector is simply a matrix that has as columns the eigenvectors of the components that we decide to keep. This makes it the first step towards dimensionality reduction, because if we choose to keep only p eigenvectors (components) out of n, the final data set will have only p dimensions.\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis Example:\n\nContinuing with the example from the previous step, we can either form a feature vector with both of the eigenvectors v1 and v2:\n\nOr discard the eigenvector v2, which is the one of lesser significance, and form a feature vector with v1 only:\n\nDiscarding the eigenvector v2 will reduce dimensionality by 1, and will consequently cause a loss of information in the final data set. But given that v2 was carrying only 4 percent of the information, the loss will be therefore not important and we will still have 96 percent of the information that is carried by v1.\n\nSo, as we saw in the example, it’s up to you to choose whether to keep all the components or discard the ones of lesser significance, depending on what you are looking for. Because if you just want to describe your data in terms of new variables (principal components) that are uncorrelated without seeking to reduce dimensionality, leaving out lesser significant components is not needed.\n\nStep 5: Recast the Data Along the Principal Components Axes\n\nIn the previous steps, apart from standardization, you do not make any changes on the data, you just select the principal components and form the feature vector, but the input data set remains always in terms of the original axes (i.e, in terms of the initial variables).\n\nIn this step, which is the last one, the aim is to use the feature vector formed using the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, to reorient the data from the original axes to the ones represented by the principal components (hence the name Principal Components Analysis). This can be done by multiplying the transpose of the original data set by the transpose of the feature vector.\n\nReferences:\n\n[Steven M.

      "# [What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? by Ellen Glover on 2024-10-21](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence)\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to build machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI enables machines to simulate human abilities, such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making and comprehension. Common applications of AI include speech recognition, image recognition, content generation, recommendation systems and self-driving cars.\n\nWhile AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, advancements in machine learning and deep learning in particular are changing virtually every industry, making AI an increasingly integral part of everyday life.\n\nWhat Is Artificial Intelligence?\n\nArtificial intelligence refers to computer systems that are capable of performing tasks traditionally associated with human intelligence — such as making predictions, identifying objects, interpreting speech and generating natural language. AI systems learn how to do so by processing massive amounts of data and looking for patterns to model in their own decision-making. In many cases, humans will supervise an AI’s learning process, reinforcing good decisions and discouraging bad ones, but some AI systems are designed to learn without supervision.\n\nOver time, AI systems improve on their performance of specific tasks, allowing them to adapt to new inputs and make decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. In essence, artificial intelligence is about teaching machines to think and learn like humans, with the goal of automating work and solving problems more efficiently.\n\nHow Does AI Work?\n\nArtificial intelligence systems work by using algorithms and data. First, a massive amount of data is collected and applied to mathematical models, or algorithms, which use the information to recognize patterns and make predictions in a process known as training. Once algorithms have been trained, they are deployed within various applications, where they continuously learn from and adapt to new data. This allows AI systems to perform complex tasks like image recognition, language processing and data analysis with greater accuracy and efficiency over time.\n\nMachine Learning\n\nThe primary approach to building AI systems is through machine learning (ML), where computers learn from large datasets by identifying patterns and relationships within the data. A machine learning algorithm uses statistical techniques to help it “learn” how to get progressively better at a task, without necessarily having been programmed for that certain task. It uses historical data as input to predict new output values. Machine learning consists of both supervised learning (where the expected output for the input is known thanks to labeled data sets) and unsupervised learning (where the expected outputs are unknown due to the use of unlabeled data sets).\n\nNeural Networks\n\nMachine learning is typically done using neural networks, a series of algorithms that process data by mimicking the structure of the human brain. These networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or “neurons,” that process information and pass it between each other. By adjusting the strength of connections between these neurons, the network can learn to recognize complex patterns within data, make predictions based on new inputs and even learn from mistakes. This makes neural networks useful for recognizing images, understanding human speech and translating words between languages.\n\nDeep Learning\n\nDeep learning is an important subset of machine learning. It uses a type of artificial neural network known as deep neural networks, which contain a number of hidden layers through which data is processed, allowing a machine to go “deep” in its learning and recognize increasingly complex patterns, making connections and weighting input for the best results. Deep learning is particularly effective at tasks like image and speech recognition and natural language processing, making it a crucial component in the development and advancement of AI systems.\n\nNatural Language Processing\n\nNatural language processing (NLP) involves teaching computers to understand and produce written and spoken language in a similar manner as humans. NLP combines computer science, linguistics, machine learning and deep learning concepts to help computers analyze unstructured text or voice data and extract relevant information from it. NLP mainly tackles speech recognition and natural language generation, and it’s leveraged for use cases like spam detection and virtual assistants.\n\nComputer Vision\n\nComputer vision is another prevalent application of machine learning techniques, where machines process raw images, videos and visual media, and extract useful insights from them. Deep learning and convolutional neural networks are used to break down images into pixels and tag them accordingly, which helps computers discern the difference between visual shapes and patterns. Computer vision is used for image recognition, image classification and object detection, and completes tasks like facial recognition and detection in self-driving cars and robots.\n\nWhy Is Artificial Intelligence Important?\n\nArtificial intelligence aims to provide machines with similar processing and analysis capabilities as humans, making AI a useful counterpart to people in everyday life. AI is able to interpret and sort data at scale, solve complicated problems and automate various tasks simultaneously, which can save time and fill in operational gaps missed by humans.\n\nAI serves as the foundation for computer learning and is used in almost every industry — from healthcare and finance to manufacturing and education — helping to make data-driven decisions and carry out repetitive or computationally intensive tasks.\n\nMany existing technologies use artificial intelligence to enhance capabilities. We see it in smartphones with AI assistants, e-commerce platforms with recommendation systems and vehicles with autonomous driving abilities. AI also helps protect people by piloting fraud detection systems online and robots for dangerous jobs, as well as leading research in healthcare and climate initiatives.\n\nTypes of Artificial Intelligence\n\nArtificial intelligence can be classified in several different ways.\n\nStrong AI vs. Weak AI\n\nAI can be organized into two broad categories: weak AI and strong AI.\n\nWeak AI (or narrow AI) refers to AI that automates specific tasks. It typically outperforms humans, but it operates within a limited context and is applied to a narrowly defined problem. For now, all AI systems are examples of weak AI, ranging from email inbox spam filters to recommendation engines to chatbots.\n\nStrong AI, often referred to as artificial general intelligence (AGI), is a hypothetical benchmark at which AI could possess human-like intelligence and adaptability, solving problems it’s never been trained to work on. AGI does not actually exist yet, and it is unclear whether it ever will.\n\nThe 4 Kinds of AI\n\nAI can then be further categorized into four main types: reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind and self-awareness.\n\nReactive machines perceive the world in front of them and react. They can carry out specific commands and requests, but they cannot store memory or rely on past experiences to inform their decision making in real time. This makes reactive machines useful for completing a limited number of specialized duties. Examples include Netflix’s recommendation engine and IBM’s Deep Blue (used to play chess).\n\nLimited memory AI has the ability to store previous data and predictions when gathering information and making decisions. Essentially, it looks into the past for clues to predict what may come next. Limited memory AI is created when a team continuously trains a model in how to analyze and utilize new data, or an AI environment is built so models can be automatically trained and renewed. Examples include ChatGPT and self-driving cars.\n\nTheory of mind is a type of AI that does not actually exist yet, but it describes the idea of an AI system that can perceive and understand human emotions, and then use that information to predict future actions and make decisions on its own.\n\nSelf-aware AI refers to artificial intelligence that has self-awareness, or a sense of self. This type of AI does not currently exist. In theory, though, self-aware AI possesses human-like consciousness and understands its own existence in the world, as well as the emotional state of others.\n\nBenefits of AI\n\nAI is beneficial for automating repetitive tasks, solving complex problems, reducing human error and much more.\n\nAutomating Repetitive Tasks\n\nRepetitive tasks such as data entry and factory work, as well as customer service conversations, can all be automated using AI technology.

They can also derive patterns from a patient’s prior medical data and use that to anticipate any future health conditions.\n\nVisual Filters\n\nFilters used on social media platforms like TikTok and Snapchat rely on algorithms to distinguish between an image’s subject and the background, track facial movements and adjust the image on the screen based on what the user is doing.\n\nThe Rise of Generative AI\n\nGenerative AI describes artificial intelligence systems that can create new content — such as text, images, video or audio — based on a given user prompt. To work, a generative AI model is fed massive data sets and trained to identify patterns within them, then subsequently generates outputs that resemble this training data.\n\nGenerative AI has gained massive popularity in the past few years, especially with chatbots and image generators arriving on the scene. These kinds of tools are often used to create written copy, code, digital art and object designs, and they are leveraged in industries like marketing, entertainment, consumer goods and manufacturing.\n\nGenerative AI comes with challenges though. For instance, it can be used to create fake content and deepfakes, which could spread disinformation and erode social trust. And some AI-generated material could potentially infringe on people’s copyright and intellectual property rights.\n\nAI Regulation\n\nAs AI grows more complex and powerful, lawmakers around the world are seeking to regulate its use and development.\n\nThe first major step to regulate AI occurred in 2024 in the European Union with the passing of its sweeping Artificial Intelligence Act, which aims to ensure that AI systems deployed there are “safe, transparent, traceable, non-discriminatory and environmentally friendly.” Countries like China and Brazil have also taken steps to govern artificial intelligence.\n\nMeanwhile, AI regulation in the United States is still a work in progress. The Biden-Harris administration introduced a non-enforceable AI Bill of Rights in 2022, and then The Executive Order on Safe, Secure and Trustworthy AI in 2023, which aims to regulate the AI industry while maintaining the country’s status as a leader in the industry. Congress has made several attempts to establish more robust legislation, but it has largely failed, leaving no laws in place that specifically limit the use of AI or regulate its risks. For now, all AI legislation in the United States exists only on the state level.\n\nFuture of Artificial Intelligence\n\nThe future of artificial intelligence holds immense promise, with the potential to revolutionize industries, enhance human capabilities and solve complex challenges. It can be used to develop new drugs, optimize global supply chains and power advanced robots — transforming the way we live and work.\n\nLooking ahead, one of the next big steps for artificial intelligence is to progress beyond weak or narrow AI and achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI). With AGI, machines will be able to think, learn and act the same way as humans do, blurring the line between organic and machine intelligence. This could pave the way for increased automation and problem-solving capabilities in medicine, manufacturing, transportation and more — as well as sentient AI down the line. In a 2024 essay about the promises of the technology, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei speculates that powerful AI might accelerate innovation in the biological sciences as much as tenfold by enabling a larger number of experiments to be conducted at any given time, and by shortening the gap between new discoveries and subsequent research building on those discoveries.\n\nOn the other hand, the increasing sophistication of AI also raises concerns about heightened job loss, widespread disinformation and loss of privacy. And questions persist about the potential for AI to outpace human understanding and intelligence — a phenomenon known as technological singularity that could lead to unforeseeable risks and possible moral dilemmas.\n\nFor now, society is largely looking toward federal and business-level AI regulations to help guide the technology’s future.\n\nHistory of AI\n\nArtificial intelligence as a concept began to take off in the 1950s when computer scientist Alan Turing released the 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” which questioned if machines could think and how one would test a machine’s intelligence. This paper set the stage for AI research and development, and was the first proposal of the Turing test, a method used to assess machine intelligence. The term “artificial intelligence” was coined in 1956 by computer scientists John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester and Claude E. Shannon at a Dartmouth College academic conference.\n\nFollowing the Dartmouth College conference and throughout the 1970s, interest in AI research grew from academic institutions and U.S. government funding. Innovations in computing allowed several AI foundations to be established during this time, including machine learning, neural networks and natural language processing.\n\nDespite its advances, AI technologies eventually became more difficult to scale than expected and declined in interest and funding, resulting in the first AI winter until the 1980s.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, AI interest reawakened as computers became more powerful, deep learning became popularized and AI-powered “expert systems” were introduced. However, due to the complication of new systems and an inability of existing technologies to keep up, the second AI winter occurred and lasted until the mid-1990s.\n\nBy the mid-2000s, innovations in processing power, big data and advanced deep learning techniques resolved AI’s previous roadblocks, allowing further AI breakthroughs. Modern AI technologies like virtual assistants, driverless cars and generative AI began entering the mainstream in the 2010s, making AI what it is today.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\nExcept where prohibited by applicable law, this section addresses how any legal dispute between you and Built In will proceed in the unlikely event that such an event should occur.\n\n7.1 INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS\n\nIf you are you are dissatisfied with our Services for any reason, please contact us by email at customer[email protected] so that we can try to resolve your concerns without the need of outside assistance. If you choose to pursue a dispute, claim or controversy against Built In, these Terms will apply. For purposes of this dispute resolution process, Built In shall include our affiliates, employees, licensors, and service providers.\n\nBefore formally pursuing a Dispute (as defined below) in arbitration or small claims court, you agree to first send a detailed notice (\"Notice\") to Built In, Inc., by email at [email protected] or by mail at 222 Merchandise Mart Plaza Suite 2010, Chicago, Illinois 60654. Should Built In have a Dispute with you, Built In agrees to first send a Notice to you at your most recent email address on file with us, or if no email address is on file, using other contact information associated with your account. Any such Notice you provide must contain all of the following information: (1) your full name; (2) additional information that enables Built In to identify you, including your address, mobile phone number, and email address; and (3) a detailed description of your Dispute, including the nature and factual basis of your claim(s) and the relief you are seeking with a corresponding calculation of your alleged damages (if any). Built In’s Notice must likewise set forth a detailed description of its Dispute, which shall include the nature and factual basis of its claim(s) and the relief it is seeking, with a corresponding calculation of our damages (if any).\n\nYou and Built In agree to then negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve the Dispute. As part of these good faith negotiations, if Built In requests a telephone conference with you to discuss your Dispute, you agree to personally participate, with your attorney if you are represented by counsel. Likewise, if you request a telephone conference to discuss Built In’s Dispute with you, Built In agrees to have one representative participate. This informal process should lead to a resolution of the Dispute. However, if the Dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of a fully completed Notice and the Parties have not otherwise mutually agreed to an extension of this informal dispute resolution time period, you or Built In may initiate an arbitration (subject to a Party’s right to elect small claims court as provided below).\n\nCompletion of this informal dispute resolution is a condition precedent to filing any demand for arbitration or small claims court action. Failure to do so is a breach of this agreement. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines will be tolled while you and Built In engage in this informal dispute resolution process. Unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration provider, the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration and shall administratively close any arbitration unless the Party bringing such demand for arbitration can certify in writing that the terms and conditions of this informal dispute resolution process were fully satisfied. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this provision and to enjoin any arbitration proceeding or small claims court action.\n\n7.2 INDIVIDUAL RELIEF: CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER\n\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, YOU AND BUILT IN EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES IN COURT IN FAVOR OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PROVIDED ABOVE). YOU AND BUILT IN EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO FILE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER OR OTHERWISE TO SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS, INCLUDING ANY CURRENTLY PENDING ACTIONS AGAINST YOU OR BUILT IN. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, CONSOLIDATED, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS. THE ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THE SAME RELIEF AVAILABLE IN COURT PROVIDED THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY ONLY AWARD FINAL RELIEF (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE OR DECLARATORY RELIEF) IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE FINAL RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD FINAL RELIEF FOR, AGAINST, OR ON BEHALF OF ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS. IF A COURT DETERMINES THAT ANY OF THESE PROHIBITIONS IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE UNENFORCEABLE AS TO A PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF (SUCH AS A REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF), AND ALL APPEALS OF THAT DECISION ARE EXHAUSTED OR THE DECISION IS OTHERWISE FINAL, THEN YOU AND BUILT IN AGREE THAT THAT PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF SHALL PROCEED IN COURT BUT SHALL BE STAYED PENDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION OF THE REMAINING CLAIMS FOR RELIEF THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT. IF THIS SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION (EXCEPT FOR THE JURY TRIAL WAIVER AND THE INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS) SHALL BE NULL AND VOID. THIS PARAGRAPH IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.\n\n7.3 DISPUTE RESOLUTION THROUGH ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT\n\nAny dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Built In that is not resolved informally by Built In CustomerService or through the informal dispute resolution process that arises from or relates in any way to this agreement (including any alleged breach of this agreement), the Services, or our relationship with you (collectively, “Dispute”), shall be exclusively resolved through BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION except as specifically provided otherwise in this Dispute Resolution Section 7. “Dispute” as used in this agreement shall have the broadest possible meaning and include claims that arose before the existence of this or any prior agreement and claims that arise during the term of this agreement or after the termination of this agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Built In may elect to have an individual claim heard in small claims court. If the request to proceed in small claims court is made after an arbitration has been initiated but before an arbitrator has been appointed, such arbitration shall be administratively closed. Any controversy over the small claims court’s jurisdiction shall be determined by the small claims court. All other issues (except as otherwise provided herein) are exclusively for the Arbitrator to decide, including but not limited to scope and enforceability of this Dispute Resolution Section 7, as well as any request to proceed in small claims court that is made after an arbitrator has been appointed. If you or Built In challenges the small claims court election in your Dispute, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the small claims court election is unenforceable, then such election shall be severed from this agreement as to your Dispute. However, such court determination shall not be considered or deemed binding with respect to Built In’s other contracting parties.\n\nAny court proceeding to enforce this Dispute Resolution Section, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, must be commenced in accordance with the Jurisdiction section of these Terms. In the event this Dispute Resolution Section is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against Built In (except for small claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Delaware. You hereby irrevocably consent to those courts’ exercise of personal jurisdiction over you for such purposes and waive any claim that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.\n\n7.4 INDIVIDUAL AND MASS ARBITRATION PROTOCOL\n\nThis subsection applies to Disputes that are submitted to AAA after fully completing the informal Notice and Dispute resolution process described above and when no small claims court election is made by either Party. Any arbitration between you and Built In shall be administered by AAA in accordance with the operative AAA Arbitration Rules (the \"AAA Rules\") in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with AAA, such as the Consumer Arbitration Rules or the Consumer Mass Arbitration Rules, as may be appropriate in the context of the dispute and as modified by this Dispute Resolution Section. For a copy of the AAA Rules, please visit https://www.adr.org/Rules or contact AAA [email protected]. If AAA is unable or unwilling to perform its duties under this agreement, the Parties shall mutually agree on an alternative administrator that will replace AAA and assume AAA’s role consistent with this agreement. If the Parties are unable to agree, they will petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an administrator that will assume AAA’s duties under this agreement.\n\nThe Parties agree that the following procedures will apply to any Arbitrations initiated under this Dispute Resolution Section:\n\nCommencing an Arbitration - To initiate an arbitration, you or Built In shall send to AAA a demand for arbitration (\"Demand for Arbitration\") that describes the claim(s) and request for relief in detail, consistent with the requirements in this agreement and AAA Rules. If you send a Demand for Arbitration, you shall also send it to Built In at Built In, Inc., 222 Merchandise Mart Plaza Suite 2010, Chicago, Illinois 60654, within 10 days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration to AAA. If Built In sends a Demand for Arbitration, we will also send it to your mailing address on file with us within the same 10-day period. If your mailing address is unavailable, we will send it to your email address on file, or if no email address is on file, other contact information associated with your account. The arbitration provider shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration and shall administratively close any such demand for arbitration that fails to certify in writing that the Party meets the requirements of this Dispute Resolution Section or if either Party elects small claims court as set forth above.\n\nFees – The payment of all fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules, except to the extent that the case is a part of a Mass Filing (as defined below) or the AAA fees and costs (including Arbitrator fees) paid by either Party are reallocated upon order of the Arbitrator following a determination that (a) either Party breached Dispute Resolution section of this agreement, (b) such reallocation is called for under this agreement, or (c) reallocation is otherwise permitted under applicable law. Upon a showing to Built In of your financial hardship we will consider a good faith request made by you to pay your portion of the applicable consumer portion of the filing fee. Built In is committed to ensuring that arbitration costs to consumers do not serve as a barrier to the adjudication of disputes. If Built In initiates an arbitration against you, we shall pay all fees.\n\nThe Arbitrator – The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral (the \"Claim Arbitrator\"), as assisted by any Process Arbitrator appointed under AAA Rules. (The term \"Arbitrator\" applies to both the Claim Arbitrator and the Process Arbitrator). If a hearing is elected by either Party, the Arbitrator shall be in or close to the location in which you reside. The Arbitrator is bound by and shall adhere to this agreement. In the event AAA Rules conflict with this agreement, the terms of this agreement shall control. If the Arbitrator determines that strict application of any term of this Dispute Resolution section of this agreement (except for the small claims election, which shall be determined by the small claims court) would result in a fundamentally unfair arbitration (the \"Unfair Term\"), then the Arbitrator shall have authority to modify the Unfair Term to the extent necessary to ensure a fundamentally fair arbitration that is consistent with the Terms of Use (the \"Modified Term\"). In determining the substance of a Modified Term, the Arbitrator shall select a term that comes closest to expressing the intention of the Unfair Term.\n\nDispositive Motions– The Parties agree that the Claim Arbitrator shall have the authority to consider dispositive motions without an oral evidentiary hearing. Dispositive motions may be requested under the following circumstances: (a) within 30 days after the Claim Arbitrator’s appointment, a Party may request to file a dispositive motion based upon the pleadings; and (b) no later than 30 days prior to the evidentiary hearing, a Party may request to file a dispositive motion for summary judgment based upon the Parties’ pleadings and the evidence submitted.\n\nDiscovery – Each Party may (a) serve up to five requests for relevant, non-privileged documents from the other Party; and (b) request that the other Party provide verified responses to no more than 5 relevant interrogatories (including subparts). Unless both Parties agree otherwise, no other forms of discovery (including depositions) may be utilized. Any such discovery requests must be served on the other Party within 21 days after the Claim Arbitrator’s appointment. The responding Party shall provide the requesting Party with all responsive, non-privileged documents, responses signed by the Party themselves to the requested interrogatories, and/or any objections to the requests within 30 days after receipt of the requests, or, in the event of an objection to any discovery request, 30 days after the Claim Arbitrator resolves the dispute. In the event either Party requests that the Claim Arbitrator consider a dispositive motion on the pleadings, such written discovery response deadlines shall be extended until 30 days following the Claim Arbitrator’s final decision on such dispositive motion. Any disputes about discovery or requests for extensions shall be submitted promptly to the Claim Arbitrator for resolution. In ruling on any discovery dispute or extension request, the Claim Arbitrator shall take into consideration the nature, amount, and scope of the underlying arbitration claim, the cost and other effort that would be involved in providing the requested discovery, the case schedule, and whether the requested discovery is necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim or defense.\n\nConfidentiality – Upon either Party’s request, the Arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either Party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal.\n\nArbitration Hearing – You and Built In are entitled to a fair evidentiary hearing (i.e. trial) before the Claim Arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings are usually simpler, less costly, and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. The Parties agree to waive all oral hearings and instead submit all disputes to the Claim Arbitrator for an award based on written submissions and other evidence as the Parties may agree, unless a Party requests an oral hearing within 10 days after the Respondent files a response. If an oral evidentiary hearing is requested, both Parties must be personally present at the hearing, regardless of whether either Party has retained counsel. Both Parties must personally attend the hearing. Either Party’s failure to personally attend the hearing, without a continuance ordered by the Claim Arbitrator for good cause, will result in a default judgment taken against that Party.\n\nArbitration Award – Regardless of the format of the arbitration, the Claim Arbitrator shall provide a reasoned decision, in writing within 30 days after the hearing or, if no hearing is held, within 30 days after any rebuttal or supplemental statements are due. The decision must clearly specify the relief, if any, awarded and contain a brief statement of the reasons for the award. The arbitration award is binding only between you and Built In and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different Party. The Claim Arbitrator may, however, choose to consider rulings from other arbitrations involving a different Party. The Arbitrator may award fees and costs as provided by the AAA Rules or to the extent such fees and costs could be awarded in court. This includes but is not limited to the ability of the Arbitrator to award fees and costs if the Arbitrator determines that a claim or defense is frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose, for the purpose of harassment, or in bad faith.\n\nOffer of Settlement – The Respondent may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer to the opposing Party any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the Claim Arbitrator until after the Claim Arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the opposing Party’s favor and is less than the Respondent’s settlement offer or if the award is in the Respondent’s favor, the opposing Party must pay the Respondent’s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney’s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the flipping of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs that claimant may be entitled to for the cause of action under which it is suing.\n\nMass Filing – If, at any time, 25 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against Built In or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities (\"Mass Filing\"), consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings set forth in the AAA’s Mass Arbitration supplemental rules and procedures (\"AAA’s Mass Filing Rules\", available at https://www.adr.org/Rules), the additional protocols set forth below shall apply.\n\nIf you or your counsel file a Demand for Arbitration that fits within the definition of Mass Filing referred to above, then you agree that your Demand for Arbitration shall be subject to the additional protocols set forth in this Mass Filing subsection. You also acknowledge that the adjudication of your Dispute might be delayed and that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled from the time at which the first cases are chosen to proceed until your case is chosen for a bellwether proceeding.\n\nAAA’s Mass Filing Rules shall apply if your Dispute is deemed by AAA, in its sole discretion pursuant to its Rules and this Dispute Resolution Section, to be part of a Mass Filing. Such election for AAA’s Mass Filing Rules and related fee schedule must be made by either you or Built In in writing and submitted to AAA’s and all Parties.\n\nBellwether Proceedings. Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by courts and arbitration administrators when there are multiple disputes involving similar claims against the same or related parties. Counsel for the Mass Filings claimants (including you) and counsel for Built In shall each select 15 Demands for Arbitration (30 total), and no more than 30 arbitrations shall be filed, processed, adjudicated, or pending at the same time, with each of the 30 individual arbitrations presided over by a different Claim Arbitrator, in a first set of bellwether proceedings. During this time, no other Demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed, adjudicated, or pending. If the Parties are unable to resolve the remaining Demands for Arbitration after the first set of bellwether proceedings are arbitrated or otherwise resolved, then counsel for the Claimants and counsel for Built In shall each select an additional 15 Demands for Arbitration (30 total) to be filed, processed, and adjudicated as individual arbitrations, with each of the 30 arbitrations presided over by a different Claim Arbitrator, in a second set of bellwether proceedings. During this time, no other Demands for Arbitration that are part of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed, or adjudicated. This staged process of bellwether proceedings, with each set including 30 Demands for Arbitration adjudicated on an individual basis, shall continue until each Demand included in the Mass Filings (including your Demand for Arbitration) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Fees associated with a Demand for Arbitration included in the Mass Filings, including fees owed by Built In and the claimants (including you), shall only be due after your Demand for Arbitration is chosen as part of a set of bellwether proceedings and therefore properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication. Any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning when you initiate the informal dispute resolution process set forth in subsection 7.1, and if the first Mass Filings’ Demands for Arbitration are chosen for the initial set of bellwether proceedings have been filed, your claims will remain tolled until your Demand for Arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled. A court of competent jurisdiction located in a venue allowed under Section 8 of the agreement shall have the power to enforce this subsection.\n\nYou and Built In agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of the arbitration and small claims court process and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Built In acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the fair resolution of genuine and sincere Disputes. The Parties further agree that application of these Mass Filings procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.\n\n7.5 FUTURE CHANGES AND RETROACTIVE APPLICATION\n\nThis Dispute Resolution Section 7 applies to all Disputes between the Parties, including for any claims that accrued against you or Built In prior to the time of your consent to this agreement and to any claims that accrue against you or Built In after your consent to this agreement. Notwithstanding any provision in this agreement to the contrary, you may elect to opt out of the retroactive application of this Dispute Resolution Section 7 as to claims that have accrued against you or against Built In prior to the time of your consent to this agreement in accordance with the opt-out instructions below.\n\n7.6 ARBITRATION OPT-OUT PROCEDURE\n\nYou may opt-out of this Dispute Resolution Section 7by sending us written notice, within 30 days of the time you consent to this agreement, to the following email address: [email protected].
