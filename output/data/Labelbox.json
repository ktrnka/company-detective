      "# [Why Labelbox is the data factory for GenAI](https://labelbox.com/why-labelbox/)\nAt Labelbox, the security and privacy of our customers’ data is a top priority. Our privacy and security program is rooted in the principles of Privacy by Design and informed by both industry standards and customer needs.\n\nCustomers can rely on Labelbox’s enterprise-grade security to support and enable breakthroughs for their machine-learning teams and AI applications. Labelbox’s seamless cloud storage integrations means your data can be quickly accessed but will remain stored in your secure, chosen cloud storage location.",
      "# [Privacy & Security Program](https://labelbox.com/company/security/)\nLabelbox considers all customer data submitted to our offering as confidential. The Labelbox application ensures that access is administered only to authorized users through data encryption both at rest and in transit, as well as through access control management and monitoring.\n\nAll labeled data, metadata and private user information hosted by Labelbox are encrypted at rest using AES-256. Labelbox uses Google Cloud for cloud storage, which means that your data will be encrypted on the server-side using GCP’s default encryption keys. Data is automatically decrypted when read by an authorized user using KMS-based protections. To ensure that privacy-sensitive data does not get compromised, Labelbox uses Auth0 for authentication.\n\nData is encrypted via Transport Layer Security (TLSv1.2+) when in transit between customers and Labelbox servers. Once data is within Labelbox's internal network, port restrictions ensure data is transmitted over protected channels such as HTTPS and SSH. Customers have a choice for hosting their assets. Customers who elect to host their assets by uploading them to Labelbox, will find the same data protection that is applied for “labeled data” above.\n\nIn order to apply best security practices, most Labelbox customers opt to host assets themselves on their choice of cloud platform using a variety of options including signed urls or delegated access. This option provides customers a variety of options for extending their existing Cloud Platform security and access control policies through to the Labelbox platform. For more information about our Cloud Provider capabilities, please refer to our online documentation.\n\nAt Labelbox, we have implemented a variety of access controls when provisioning administrative roles and associated privileges. We approach customer data under least privilege and need-to-know bases as well as log access to environments in our cloud infrastructure for monitoring and security purposes.",
      "# [Partnerships](https://labelbox.com/company/partnerships/)\nBurberry uses thousands of images from multiple sources for its global marketing campaigns. The company must classify these valuable assets precisely so that it can use them effectively in its campaigns to drive the right action by the right audience. Burberry works with a high-volume of unstructured data sets to train their object detection and classification models. They quickly realized it wasn’t possible to identify and label all these images manually and needed their image recognition models to identify highly specific products and apparel SKUs.\n\nBurberry implemented Labelbox’s data engine within its Databricks Lakehouse Platform environment. Image annotation projects that used to take months now take just hours, and marketing team members now have access to powerful content insights without asking for help from data scientists. Databricks’ Lakehouse Platform continues to give Burberry a total lower cost of ownership than the company’s original business case projected.",
      "# [Labelbox Community](https://community.labelbox.com/faq)\nThis is a Civilized Place for Public Discussion\n\nPlease treat this discussion forum with the same respect you would a public park. We, too, are a shared community resource — a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation.\n\nThese are not hard and fast rules. They are guidelines to aid the human judgment of our community and keep this a kind, friendly place for civilized public discourse.\n\nImprove the Discussion\n\nHelp us make this a great place for discussion by always adding something positive to the discussion, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.\n\nOne way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Spend time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.\n\nThe topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.\n\nBe Agreeable, Even When You Disagree\n\nYou may wish to respond by disagreeing. That’s fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid:\n\nName-calling\n\nAd hominem attacks\n\nResponding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content\n\nKnee-jerk contradiction\n\nInstead, provide thoughtful insights that improve the conversation.\n\nYour Participation Counts\n\nThe conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be — and avoiding those that do not.\n\nDiscourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, watching, muting and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.\n\nLet’s leave our community better than we found it.\n\nIf You See a Problem, Flag It\n\nModerators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.\n\nWhen you see bad behavior, don’t reply. Replying encourages bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. Just flag it. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.\n\nIn order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.\n\nAlways Be Civil\n\nNothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:\n\nBe civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.\n\nKeep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.\n\nRespect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.\n\nRespect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.\n\nThese are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of a major news site.\n\nThis is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.\n\nKeep It Tidy\n\nMake the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:\n\nDon’t start a topic in the wrong category; please read the category definitions.\n\nDon’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.\n\nDon’t post no-content replies.\n\nDon’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.\n\nDon’t sign your posts — every post has your profile information attached to it.\n\nRather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.\n\nPost Only Your Own Stuff\n\nYou may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.\n\nPowered by You\n\nThis site is operated by your friendly local staff and you, the community. If you have any further questions about how things should work here, open a new topic in the site feedback category and let’s discuss! If there’s a critical or urgent issue that can’t be handled by a meta topic or flag, contact us via the staff page.\n\nTerms of Service",

The projects will require labeling many data with various object tags. Using an open-source tool is an option but will require an engineering effort as I will look for the following features (Mentioned in the next paragraph) to add in the future.   \n\n\nHowever, I am also looking at tools (paid versions such as label box, roboflow, superannotate, etc) that can make the labeling effort faster from day one. The tool needs to have the following features:  \n\n\n* Easy to visualize data and annotations\n* Data embedding \n* Custom labeling and review workflows \n* Model-assisted labeling  and auto-labeling tool  \n\n\nI would appreciate it if I could get some feedback from the broader computer vision community about their experiences of using the paid version tool.   \n\n\nWhat was the tool that you used for your project and why?   \n\n\nIf the opportunity is provided again, would you pick up the same tool? If not, why?  \n\n\nkeeping the cost of annotation in mind, do you have any preferences for the paid version tools?   \n\n\nThanks in advance!!!   \n\n\n## Comment ID kywu399 with +7 score by [(aloser, Reddit, 2024-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1c047cd/labeling_tool_free_vs_paid_version_any/kywu399/) (in reply to ID 1c047cd):\nI’m biased as one of the founders of Roboflow, but it does all of that and more.   \n\n* We run every image you upload through CLIP and [index it for semantic search](https://blog.roboflow.com/dataset-search/) or [by metadata](https://docs.roboflow.com/datasets/dataset-search) to help you choose which images to label,   \n* have great [collaboration tools](https://docs.roboflow.com/annotate/team-collaboration) including support for external labelers who only get access to the specific data you assign to them,   \n* are on the forefront of automatic labeling with [a hosted version](https://blog.roboflow.com/launch-auto-label/) of our [autodistill open source project](https://github.com/autodistill/autodistill) that uses foundation models to pre-annotate images,  \n* integrate our labeling tools [with SAM](https://blog.roboflow.com/automated-polygon-labeling-computer-vision/) (which we host for you on our GPUs) for automatic polygon drawing and   \n* your own [custom models for pre-annotating](https://docs.roboflow.com/annotate/use-roboflow-annotate/model-assisted-labeling) once you’ve got one trained,  \n* support [training state of the art models right in our platform](https://docs.roboflow.com/train/train) to use for labeling (or deployment),  \n* and [have extensive APIs](https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/introduction) to extend our functionality and integrate with your own systems.   \n\n~~It’s $249 for the paid version but you get tons and tons of value (the above list is only scratching the surface).

I have used it in the past. This time based on the scale of the project and volume of annotations, it makes more sense to evaluate paid version of the tools. For this project quality of the annotation will be very important so I want a tool where multiple person can collaborate and later model assisted labeling. \n\nAll my requirements can be full filled with labels studio but it will add resource allocation and more time to build/maintant the tool as per needs. \n\nI am just trying get some feedback about using paid version tools, pros and cons of using them and recommnedations of such tools from the bigger vision community.\n\n## Comment ID kywogfy with +3 score by [(ElderLurkr, Reddit, 2024-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1c047cd/labeling_tool_free_vs_paid_version_any/kywogfy/) (in reply to ID 1c047cd):\nAre you a student? Doing independent research? Side project? \n\nCVAT is always a decent free, open source option. But it won’t have custom labeling and review workflows. You can set up models for autolabeling, but they tend not to be very good or useful. This is normally true of paid tools that have similar features too.\n\nIt sounds like you want features that would be in paid tools, but I imagine your budget is small. Roboflow, V7, and Dataloop would be some possible options to look at.\n\n### Comment ID kyy23n9 with +2 score by [(mimtiaz51, Reddit, 2024-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1c047cd/labeling_tool_free_vs_paid_version_any/kyy23n9/) (in reply to ID kywogfy):\nThanks for sharing your feedback.\n\n## Comment ID kyutbjm with +3 score by [(lalamax3d, Reddit, 2024-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1c047cd/labeling_tool_free_vs_paid_version_any/kyutbjm/) (in reply to ID 1c047cd):\nI m also looking for tools to label 3d data.. 🤔\n\n### Comment ID kywprxx with +3 score by [(intellidumb, Reddit, 2024-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1c047cd/labeling_tool_free_vs_paid_version_any/kywprxx/) (in reply to ID kyutbjm):\nhttps://github.com/HumanSignal/awesome-data-labeling?tab=readme-ov-file#3d\n\n### Comment ID kywcf8g with +1 score by [(Lazygruntz, Reddit, 2024-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1c047cd/labeling_tool_free_vs_paid_version_any/kywcf8g/) (in reply to ID kyutbjm):\nI second this!\n\n## Comment ID kywpg1w with +3 score by [(intellidumb, Reddit, 2024-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1c047cd/labeling_tool_free_vs_paid_version_any/kywpg1w/) (in reply to ID 1c047cd):\nBeside labelstudio and roboflow, these might be worth a look\n\n* https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat\n* https://github.com/autodistill/autodistill\n* https://github.com/vietanhdev/anylabeling\n* or the awesome-list https://github.com/HumanSignal/awesome-data-labeling\n\n## Comment ID kywmqom with +4 score by [(mrdanibudapest, Reddit, 2024-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1c047cd/labeling_tool_free_vs_paid_version_any/kywmqom/) (in reply to ID 1c047cd):\nI wanted to recommend Roboflow because I think their tooling is quite good, I did some pet projects with them a few years back.

It boosts up the labeling effort. Instead in labeling the whole image, now the annotators will focus on making corrections and labeling mislabeled data\n\n## Comment ID l0j3nhr with +1 score by [(PuzzleheadedComb8279, Reddit, 2024-04-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1c047cd/labeling_tool_free_vs_paid_version_any/l0j3nhr/) (in reply to ID 1c047cd):\nThis is a good/free tool with a lot of features. https://github.com/stephanecharette/DarkMark this is also good but a little trickier to setup https://github.com/lordofkillz/DarkFusion\n\n## Comment ID lomr27m with +1 score by [(learnlogik, Reddit, 2024-09-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1c047cd/labeling_tool_free_vs_paid_version_any/lomr27m/) (in reply to ID 1c047cd):\nInstead going for roboflow, the easiest and better bet would be using label studio in aws marketplace.

OP trust me I went on a similar search a few months back and after bouncing around a few options decided that Label Studio is the way to go. The pricing on the paid tools like CVAT, Roboflow and cousins is insane and honestly its something that a good programmer can easily build on their own quite quickly now with GPT4.\n\nMy go to option now is to use the docker images of label studio either on a cheap instance or locally. The only thing you need to spend a little time on is to understand how to write the ML Backend for auto-labelling and ML assisted labelling - and they have very nice examples for all usual vision tasks which you can just copy paste.

      "# Post ID jjls17: [D] Annotation Tools Comparison with +92 score by [(debbydai, Reddit, 2020-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/jjls17/d_annotation_tools_comparison/)\nI am a newbie to annotation tools. After trying a few FREE annotation tools, I figured why not share my experience with others. I have tried annotation 3 tools, which are Labelbox, dLabel and supervised.\n\nMy comparison will be in sections.\n\n**1 Uploading**\n\nMy images sample were 50 frames.\n\n    dLabel ------easy to upload but a little confused to see \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zrclaxeqitv51.png?width=1124&format=png&auto=webp&s=2652e742d90bcd1d63cd5fb1dc12912f084592eb\n\nfinding where to upload your own database is easy to spot and upload. However, after uploading the selected images, it doesn’t show how many images have been uploaded. And it doesn't have a complication button to finish uploading which is a bit confusing. This could be a problem if the data is massive.\n\n    Labelbox -----easy and clear to upload  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lz89szkritv51.png?width=872&format=png&auto=webp&s=f62319f0b28f5815d42cd8bd54400d786abcc67d\n\nOnce I sign in, I can start to upload your own data and it shows how many images have been added and easily to complete uploading. Like dLabel you can see your items after uploading the dataset, set annotation tool etc.\n\n    Spervisely  -------Hard to upload for first time users \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b0v5vbusitv51.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=2220053a3a5bfaccb96d237dc005064bb6c2931f\n\nThough it has a small demonstration Gif, it still takes more time to import the images as it has too many unnecessary steps such as asking about the uploading way and you can only add the project name after uploading your dataset.\n\n**2 adding annotation objects**\n\n    dLabel     \n\nI can add annotation objects at both after uploading your dataset and whenever you want. And it has this “attribute” function” where you can define, add more information, classify the objects. But I can not edit the added annotation objects.\n\n    Labelbox \n\nLike dLabel, you can create annotation objects whenever you want. However, it is less convenient than dLabel as you need to go to the editor’s page and edit or add more annotation objects. There is “classification” function where you can classify the objects. I personally like the “attribute “ feature from dLabel more and it can contain more information about the objects.\n\n    Spervisely  \n\nAdding and modifying the annotation objects are easy and clear. There is no feature like or similar to “attribute” from dLabel or “classification” form Labelbox. One good part is that I can personalize my own hotkeys for each object, which can adapt an individual's annotation habit.\n\n**3 Annotation speed for 30 frames.**\n\nThe data set is 30images. Using bonding boxes. 2 annotation objects (hand and drink)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||uploading data time|annotation time|clicks per frame|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|dLabel|1 min|9 min|7 clicks|\n|Labelbox|1 min|11 min 10 sec|7 clicks|\n|Supervisly|2 min|11 min 30 sec|9 clicks|\n\n**4 layout of the annotation page**\n\n    dLabel  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/63kfjmluitv51.png?width=1367&format=png&auto=webp&s=d40dfe571254ff2aa118b03bb6873eabde286c72\n\nYou have the features at the left, the statues in the right and the image in the centre.\n\nOne the left side, there is one “group” feature which I found is very useful. It adds interaction between objects. Like you set the “tomato” and the “hand” into one group which indicates they have interactions. The hand is picking the tomato.\n\nThere is a history column on the right where you can also trace the annotation history on the right.\n\nOn the bottom of the centre, there’s one QA bar which can come in hand when doing quality control.\n\n    Labelbox\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fkpotowvitv51.png?width=1374&format=png&auto=webp&s=13d08cf8b70f37e80c7ff061d3295578579f124f\n\nI personally find the layout too simple. There are not many features. So There is nothing much to say.\n\n    Spervisely\n    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fm4iwqnxitv51.png?width=1425&format=png&auto=webp&s=21281956ae70f25c7d3bad64d54b5dfc27116e0d\n\nthe right side features are bit confusing...\n\nI didn't quite understand what are\"image properties\" and \"objects properties\".\n\nIt shows the annotation history which Labelbox doesn't have hotkeys easily .\n\n## Comment ID gaddbvk with +15 score by [(timmy-burton, Reddit, 2020-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/jjls17/d_annotation_tools_comparison/gaddbvk/) (in reply to ID jjls17):\nYou should probably try CVAT as well.\n\n### Comment ID gaedwx1 with +2 score by [(darknight_upenn, Reddit, 2020-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/jjls17/d_annotation_tools_comparison/gaedwx1/) (in reply to ID gaddbvk):\nCVAT is the best so far, IMO.\n\n#### Comment ID gaghk9l with +1 score by [(debbydai, Reddit, 2020-10-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/jjls17/d_annotation_tools_comparison/gaghk9l/) (in reply to ID gaedwx1):\noh. i will for sure have a try.\n\n### Comment ID gaghikx with +1 score by [(debbydai, Reddit, 2020-10-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/jjls17/d_annotation_tools_comparison/gaghikx/) (in reply to ID gaddbvk):\nyes. i have heard of CVAT . well try it later and share my thoughts as well. thanks !!!\n\n## Comment ID gadd2ol with +3 score by [(weetbix2, Reddit, 2020-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/jjls17/d_annotation_tools_comparison/gadd2ol/) (in reply to ID jjls17):\nNice!

This was my only income while I am job searching and I literally won't be able to feed my kids now.\n\n### Comment ID ldsebxm with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-07-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/outlier_ai/comments/1e6843g/looks_like_i_got_booted/ldsebxm/) (in reply to ID lds5qxo):\nDM me!\n\n### Comment ID ldsje3d with +5 score by [(WHOA_____, Reddit, 2024-07-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/outlier_ai/comments/1e6843g/looks_like_i_got_booted/ldsje3d/) (in reply to ID lds5qxo):\nI'm sorry to hear that and I feel your pain.

You send data via an API call, their system makes a guess, and a human will give the final check. So essentially, semi-supervised learning as a service (SLaaS, you're welcome). It's being used by huge companies like OpenAI, Baidu, AirBnB.\n\nI guess my question is.. why is it so valuable? They have clearly simplified the workflow for gathering training data through their platform and human outsourcing. But what makes their method special? Why can't another company replicate it- it seems like a project magnitudes cheaper than $1 billion.\n\nIs the initial estimation algorithm proprietary and does it hold a lot of their value? Is the efficiency and accuracy of their human-labelling side unmatched?\n\nNote: these are genuine questions and should not be read as if they're rhetorical.\n\n## Comment ID focowkl with +21 score by [(igorsusmelj, Reddit, 2020-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/g6r0yv/d_scale_ai_what_separates_them_and_why_are_they/focowkl/) (in reply to ID g6r0yv):\nScale is not the only company doing annotation.

Other companies such as Appen already IPOd years ago. They started with simple outsourcing tasks.\n\nThere is now a new wave of startups trying to improve the workflow and tools of such outsourcing tasks using ML. At the same time they each try to build a platform out of it. At the moment they might be replaceable but if one manages to succeed they might become some sort of standard for everyone. \nThat's at least how I would see it.

Sure, there are many \"if\"s involved, but imho there is a chance a large portion of low-sophistication, off-the-shelve \"data science\" work (collect some data in a pandas dataframe, run some default scikit learn models to make predictions, make some shiny visualizations) will eventually include fine-tuning sota models in a supervised fashion to include knowledge extracted from text (and images?). Thus compared to today, there would be far more companies requireing labeing data.\n\nIf something like this happens, my (sad) experience is that if there is some company offering labeling as a service that lists a few major players as its customers, that can be enough to make execs prefer them. **If** something like this happens, I think Scale AIs headstart and marketing may actually be enough to make them really profitable regardless of if competitors are offer similar or even slightly better services.\n\nApart from that, obviously I would not rule out hype and overvaluation as mentioned in other comments.\n\n### Comment ID fofaf5i with +3 score by [(catandDuck, Reddit, 2020-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/g6r0yv/d_scale_ai_what_separates_them_and_why_are_they/fofaf5i/) (in reply to ID foexn8o):\nThis is an interesting perspective and it makes sense generally.

      "# Post ID 1fyv700: Top Rated Plus Upwork profile got permanently suspended with +68 score by [(martinborovski, Reddit, 2024-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/1fyv700/top_rated_plus_upwork_profile_got_permanently/)\nOn September 26th I got logged out from Upwork on all devices and at the moment I haven't received anything from Upwork. I couldn't log in and my contracts were ended, as my clients told me.\n\nAfter I reached out, Upwork told me that I or someone that I had contacted with made a serious ToS violation. They haven't provided any reasoning for the ban, not even vaguely pointed to a section in the ToS.\n\nI was a Top Rated Plus freelancer, in a group of under 1% of freelancers that had 0 bad reviews and 100% Job Success Score. Over $200K in total earnings.\n\nMost of my contracts were long-term, and I was working only with Enterprise clients, and I got labeled as a \"dangerous freelancer to hire\", as my clients told me.\n\nIs this the right way for Upwork to treat freelancers who have invested years in its platform and earned Upwork tens of thousands of dollars with their labor?\n\nIs there a way to overturn the suspension, or at least find out the reason?\n\nI have already lost clients..\n\n**Note:** I haven't subcontracted anyone, I haven't contacted anyone outside of Upwork, and I haven't made a serious violation/violation of any kind to my knowledge.\n\n**UPDATE:** Upwork has suspended my account because I used wrongfully my client account. Basically, I posted a job where I asked freelancers for a free trial, a small 5-minute task, and that is against Upwork's Terms of Service. I also understand that when a job is posted, it typically goes through a review process to ensure it meets Upwork's guidelines and standards, which makes the suspension even more difficult for me to comprehend. The job post was approved, but I received only 1 proposal {which didn't complete the task) and haven't hired anyone. This was 18 months before my suspension, and I haven't even thought about this. And yes, I'm still permanently suspended.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u7vvnpscxhtd1.jpg?width=1357&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d7e54a9a1f938b71a451c19f8e8eb7efcdb6053\n\n## Comment ID lqwue7b with +45 score by [(authorAVDawn, Reddit, 2024-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/1fyv700/top_rated_plus_upwork_profile_got_permanently/lqwue7b/) (in reply to ID 1fyv700):\nI just got a warning pop up on my account telling me I could lose my account if I pay a freelancer outside of Upwork.... on a job where the freelancer had already been paid through Upwork... and the work was done...

Had anyone from Upwork looked at my account, which, similar to OP, is top rated and has perfect client feedback, or looked at all at the chat history, it is so clear that nothing nefarious was happening or going to happen.\n\nWhat infuriates me about Upwork is that they have no live CS. Everything is sending an email and then waiting sometimes a day to hear back. The cherry on top is that once some key words or phrases are triggered they don’t even have a human review the account, it’s just immediately suspended with no way to contact anyone for swift resolve.\n\nIt really is complete bullshit on so many levels and I definitely feel for OP.

They have a 3rd party contact you, and they work with you through a mitigation process. During which Upwork has to give a legitimate reason for the ban, and possibly a way to uplift the ban. If the mitigation process fails, I believe you can then file a civil lawsuit for damages. It may fall under the Small Claims court, but if you have a case you can obtain console on a pro-bono basis. If you don't have a case, you can't and you shouldn't pay for legal representation as its a good sign that the Lawyer doesn't feel its worth the risk.\n\nJust a warning, the process is VERY slow. It will hurt, and take many months to complete.\n\nGoogle \"Europa Marketplace Regulations\" and you can find the form and the process. They provide this service for ALL marketplaces, including Amazon, Ebay, Upwork and many others.\n\nFeel free to copy and paste this to others, but do not provide a link as Reddit shadow blocks many of my links.\n\n#### Comment ID lr1obh2 with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-10-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/1fyv700/top_rated_plus_upwork_profile_got_permanently/lr1obh2/) (in reply to ID lr1gcl4):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID lqxpbm7 with +18 score by [(RMorguito, Reddit, 2024-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/1fyv700/top_rated_plus_upwork_profile_got_permanently/lqxpbm7/) (in reply to ID 1fyv700):\nWhat a nightmare, man. \n\nWe're constantly seeing reports like yours here, which is extremely concerning.\n\nI'm not talking about those generic \"my account was banned for no reason\" posts but about genuine and reputable freelancers getting permanently banned without being granted the right to defend themselves. \n\nI'm not from the US, but since Upwork is an American company, is it even legal there? \n\nHonestly, I would be devasted if this happened to me since Upwork is my main source of income nowadays.\n\n### Comment ID lr1ne0i with +3 score by [(lisbon1957, Reddit, 2024-10-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/1fyv700/top_rated_plus_upwork_profile_got_permanently/lr1ne0i/) (in reply to ID lqxpbm7):\nSorry, this is America with a very crude form of capitalism.

Forget freelancers, what job security even regular employees have today? Most of them can be fired at will, thanks to massive commoditization of programming jobs. The dude that will replace you is going to write the exact same python script, push to the exact same github repos and publish the exact same docker containers. What exact USP do you bring to the table which ensures that any platform or employer will think hundred times before firing you?\n\nThe \"top rated\" here is just a lollipop they give you, as they say \"Employee of the Year\" or even \"Cookie Award\" as they used to call in my former company.

Last year, my account was permanently banned due to incorrect ID verification. I attempted to contact them via email, but it was unsuccessful. Then, I decided to visit their HQ office and spoke with one of their employees. Eventually, after 2 months, I received an email regarding an interview for account reactivation. During the interview, they asked me various questions and checked my PC. They even asked some technical questions. It was a 2-hour interview session. They asked for all the details about how I opened my Upwork account, when I started my professional career, where I graduated, where I worked, what I did, etc. Then, after a couple of days, I received an email about my account reactivation. So I managed to overcome the permanent ban.\n\n## Comment ID lqxm21o with +1 score by [(writeonfinance, Reddit, 2024-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/1fyv700/top_rated_plus_upwork_profile_got_permanently/lqxm21o/) (in reply to ID 1fyv700):\nDid you have any particularly contentious interactions or problematic clients/contracts recently?\n\n### Comment ID lqxmrne with +2 score by [(martinborovski, Reddit, 2024-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/1fyv700/top_rated_plus_upwork_profile_got_permanently/lqxmrne/) (in reply to ID lqxm21o):\nI received spam offers regularly.

Since you will not get unbanned anyways? I'm curious lol\n\nI was once banned in a platform for trying to lower my registration age to get a student discount I learned from reddit they would offer if you registred a <18yo age. Got banned next day, and they also refused to tell me the motive of the violation, but I very well knew why that was. (Still thought that their decision to ban me for that was idiotic from the business perspective, since I was going to buy a suscribtion anyways and just wanted to try to get a discount first lol)\n\n### Comment ID lqyf94l with +2 score by [(martinborovski, Reddit, 2024-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/1fyv700/top_rated_plus_upwork_profile_got_permanently/lqyf94l/) (in reply to ID lqydsgb):\nI am using Proton VPN, and I'm aware that might be the reason because it can trigger unusual login patterns.   \n  \nWhen I appealed the decision I made sure that was the first thing brought up in the conversation.

They don't give the reasons, because they don't want the appealers to come up with easy lies to excuse those things.\n\nAs someone else told you here, it appears that your violation was fraud related, which might be related with the VPN usage (and abuse, since you can easily have that \"scheme\" working on a couple of people logging into your account from different locations and using the same VPN to try hiding the trail).\n\nThey wouldn't directly just ban you for that, and would have done a detailed inquiry into the activity, compared communication style, work quality, work hours, etc.\n\nSo good luck with that appeal!\n\nPs. to the people reading, don't do this kind of activity on hourly contracts. Its fraud. Its far easier to work via an agency account and subcontract your hourly people there.\n\n## Comment ID lqytnfw with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/1fyv700/top_rated_plus_upwork_profile_got_permanently/lqytnfw/) (in reply to ID 1fyv700):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID lqytnhc with +1 score by [(AutoModerator, Reddit, 2024-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/1fyv700/top_rated_plus_upwork_profile_got_permanently/lqytnhc/) (in reply to ID lqytnfw):\nHello!

Our sales playbook is getting dialed in and it’s been vastly improved from when I first started 6 months ago.

Don't get me wrong, Manu is a good dude but he's gotta get out of of the way sometimes. Revenue is surprisingly low considering the valuation.

I get to build tools that are enabling fascinating AI uses cases across so many industries. \n\nFirst of all, I couldn't be more excited about working with the new head of engineering. The current engineering leader is highly technical and comes from Autodesk. Autodesk has many similarities to Labelbox as both companies build highly complex software systems (graphics &amp; backend). I am more optimistic and enthusiastic about working on products than ever before. It's a night and day difference compared to the previous leadership in the product and engineering. The former engineering leader wasn't decisive and didn't act fast or did much. For example, our CI/CD has been sub-par for a long time. The new engineering leader quickly identified this and is leading the change. When the CEO let go of the former director of product and VPE, I wasn't sure about the decision. But now, after seeing the new state, it all makes sense. We are shipping new innovative products and features faster than ever. Our new product managers &amp; engineers are passionate, technical, and take ownership. It just feels like more things are getting done. \n\nI've liked that the company has embraced the remote first strategy. I moved out of the bay area and have been able to work from different places and be more productive. \n\nFinally, I very much enjoy building things here. It's the first company I have worked for where the company values are used to make decisions daily. For example, people high-five each other during allhands or in slack about something great someone did and exemplified the company values.",

          "pros": "Before this job, I worked at one of the Big 4 in consulting. I had been developing a tech background in consulting for around a year and a half before joining Labelbox. \n\nI couldn't be happier with my life now. I'll break this down a bit:\n\n- The Industry:\nLabelbox works with cutting-edge AI in every industry, and it's pretty badass. As an AI nerd myself, I get to see how companies are using AI and how Labelbox helps them do that. \n\n- The Leadership:\nI get encouraged by leadership to lean into my intellectual curiosity however it manifests. Leadership constantly checks in to make sure I'm able to manage my daily responsibilities, job goals, and my own greater career goals. I truly feel heard, and this level of attention is something I've never experienced working at a Big 4.\n\n- The People:\nThe work culture is fantastic, and everyone is really exciting and friendly. Since everyone is remote, they have automated systems that make sure you stay connected - not in a \"stay connected and talk about work\" kind of way, but in more of a \"put your work down for a little bit and connect with another person\" kind of way. It's really nice; I've worked here 100% remotely and when I met everyone in person the first time they truly did feel like friends. We all had a big barbecue, and even had private DJ-hosted party at an art gallery venue after! That is a testament to the culture here. \n\nThe Work-Life Balance:\nI have a near-perfect work-life balance due to the company culture. I've been told \"why are you still online, go enjoy your evening\" at 5:30PM PLENTY of times. This job and the people truly respect your time. \n\nVacation Days:\nAlso, there's unlimited PTO - and they mean it. Team members are happy to cover for each other, and there's a lot of intended protocols to make sure that PTO is seamless. There's never any guilt in taking PTO here, which is something I admittedly did feel working at a Big 4 consulting firm. \n\nWorking Remotely:\nThe job is 100% remote, but they do have an office in SF. Truly, you are free to do whichever you want and there's no pressure in either direction. My boss moved to Hawaii...just because. As long as you can do your job, Labelbox is happy so long as you are!",

I work remotely (along with a good chunk of the company), but there are many scheduled processes and events to still build a strong company culture for everyone. There are also sponsored daily lunch for all employees.\n\nWhile interviewing, one of my concerns was reading Glassdoor about a very hands-on CEO. That was the exact situation I dealt with at my last company that led an extremely poor work-life balance and eventually was the cause of my departure there. However, I have experienced Manu (the Labelbox CEO) to be a great communicator and collaborator thus far. The work-life balance has been very enjoyable and the entire team is friendly. So that's why I wanted to share my experience here - most of the negative reviews I read seem to be pretty outdated or from disgruntled ex-employees.",

The founders have never had any significant management experience before this and it really shows. \r\n\r\nMorale is super low and employees have started to say they won't recommend their friends to the company anymore, and if COVID wasn't an issue and the job market was better, many of them would have left.

We have women running customer success, women in key roles in our legal, marketing, and more.\r\n-Surprisingly well run remote onboarding program, and great remote work setup \r\n-Comp is quite good, and the company lets you expense $20 lunch during the pandemic. \r\n\r\nI've been through my share of weird team shifts and crushing workloads at Labelbox, but that's the startup life. If I wanted a chill but boring life I would just go over to an established company. I think some of the negative reviews in Glassdoor have some merit but life here isn't as bad as they make it out to be. I've been at a toxic company before and this one is far from it. The people are actually quite well intentioned, and maybe there is some immature leadership but it's not all that bad. \r\n\r\nI think a lot of Labelbox's sad days are behind it. We've gotten past a lot of tough moments where the product was buggy, customers were ticked off, COVID pandemic was crushing everyone, etc.... Now there's light at the end of the tunnel.

Have been able to learn a lot here because of the free information exchange between engineering teams.\n• Great benefits. They recently improved them as well. They were always good, but I am optimistic they will only keep getting better (talking medical/dental/vision here)\n• The daily lunch allowance they give us is my love language\n• Most flexible job I have ever had. As long as I go to the meetings I am supposed to, I feel completely free to get my work done at the times that are the most convenient for me.\n• Great remote culture. I feel like I know more coworkers better than at my last in office job because of the ways the help us stay engaged remotely.\n• Competitive compensation packages\n• I truly feel a connection to the company mission and feel like I am making an impact. There are just a lot of cool problems people are trying to solve and Labelbox is a tool that can help them solve it.",

They shamelessly ask people to work during holidays, hiding behind the excuse of 'this is how startups work.'\n\nI can’t emphasize enough how terrible the management is. The fancier the title, the more incompetent the person. Every 'director of something' holds their position simply because they blindly agree with whatever the CEO decides. \n\nMany teams in this company operate in silos with virtually no oversight, freely building whatever they want. \n\nThey often lie to customers, and the Alignerr product is probably the most alarming example. The manager/director in charge has no scruples—this person is willing to say or do anything to win customer contracts. It’s genuinely disturbing. \n\nIf you like to witness chaos, people without any morals, join this company is quite amazing to see.",

The current engineering leader is highly technical and comes from Autodesk. Autodesk has many similarities to Labelbox as both companies build highly complex software systems (graphics &amp; backend). I am more optimistic and enthusiastic about working on products than ever before. It's a night and day difference compared to the previous leadership in the product and engineering. The former engineering leader wasn't decisive and didn't act fast or did much. For example, our CI/CD has been sub-par for a long time. The new engineering leader quickly identified this and is leading the change. When the CEO let go of the former director of product and VPE, I wasn't sure about the decision. But now, after seeing the new state, it all makes sense. We are shipping new innovative products and features faster than ever. Our new product managers &amp; engineers are passionate, technical, and take ownership. It just feels like more things are getting done. \n\nI've liked that the company has embraced the remote first strategy. I moved out of the bay area and have been able to work from different places and be more productive. \n\nFinally, I very much enjoy building things here.

        "pros": "Before this job, I worked at one of the Big 4 in consulting. I had been developing a tech background in consulting for around a year and a half before joining Labelbox. \n\nI couldn't be happier with my life now. I'll break this down a bit:\n\n- The Industry:\nLabelbox works with cutting-edge AI in every industry, and it's pretty badass. As an AI nerd myself, I get to see how companies are using AI and how Labelbox helps them do that. \n\n- The Leadership:\nI get encouraged by leadership to lean into my intellectual curiosity however it manifests. Leadership constantly checks in to make sure I'm able to manage my daily responsibilities, job goals, and my own greater career goals. I truly feel heard, and this level of attention is something I've never experienced working at a Big 4.\n\n- The People:\nThe work culture is fantastic, and everyone is really exciting and friendly. Since everyone is remote, they have automated systems that make sure you stay connected - not in a \"stay connected and talk about work\" kind of way, but in more of a \"put your work down for a little bit and connect with another person\" kind of way. It's really nice; I've worked here 100% remotely and when I met everyone in person the first time they truly did feel like friends. We all had a big barbecue, and even had private DJ-hosted party at an art gallery venue after! That is a testament to the culture here. \n\nThe Work-Life Balance:\nI have a near-perfect work-life balance due to the company culture. I've been told \"why are you still online, go enjoy your evening\" at 5:30PM PLENTY of times. This job and the people truly respect your time. \n\nVacation Days:\nAlso, there's unlimited PTO - and they mean it. Team members are happy to cover for each other, and there's a lot of intended protocols to make sure that PTO is seamless. There's never any guilt in taking PTO here, which is something I admittedly did feel working at a Big 4 consulting firm. \n\nWorking Remotely:\nThe job is 100% remote, but they do have an office in SF. Truly, you are free to do whichever you want and there's no pressure in either direction. My boss moved to Hawaii...just because. As long as you can do your job, Labelbox is happy so long as you are!",

      "# [Labelbox should use PDF.js not Google Document AI by b.combs on 2024-03-26](https://community.labelbox.com/t/labelbox-should-use-pdf-js-not-google-document-ai/1083)\nHey,\n\nMy team recently looked into the new “automatic text layer” generation that happens when we upload a PDF to labelbox for annotation. We are disappointed to see that Labelbox has decided to make a complicated and expensive solution out of text extraction from PDF’s by using Google Document AI instead of just PDF.js. This would save Labelbox a ton of time, money, and avoid using shoddy OCR technology. What is worse is that most of our documents are going to be over the 15 page limit that Google Document AI applies.\n\nLabelbox has gone from one of my favorite products to something we probably can’t use unless Google Document AI is scrapped for PDF.js\n\nHey @gunderwood I super appreciate your investment in my concern/issue and for critically thinking about a solution that will work for me moving forward. I want to add some additional context to what my ideal solution is so we can keep trying to figure something out together!\n\nWe want to select a piece of text in a PDF document in a way that:\n\nis aware of the PDF layout (cell wrapping, dual columns, etc.),\n\nallows text to be pulled from the underlying document itself (with no OCR),\n\nand is able to export that text to a format for machine learning outside of the labeling platform.\n\nAll while being as convenient as possible for the annotator - something I know Labelbox’s product team is also very keen on!\n\nNote: for scanned or photographed PDF’s, as well as images, we will plan to use OCR, we’re not unreasonable We only want to use OCR to get something into a text format when it isn’t that already - so that it can then be parsed on a computer.\n\nWe don’t want to use OCR to take a text format that is already being parsed by a computer, convert it to an image, and then spend a bunch of resources to turn it back into a different, worse text format.\n\nI am happy to jump on a zoom call with you, if you’d like to discuss, screen share, brainstorm, etc. Thanks again for your attention!",
      "# [How to generate industry-specific data for AI training with Labelbox](https://labelbox.com/blog/how-to-generate-industry-specific-data-for-ai-training-with-labelbox)\nGenerative AI models are becoming increasingly sophisticated thanks to advances in post-training and model alignment tasks. As a result, the demand for models that not only understand language but also grasp the nuances of specific industries is skyrocketing.\n\nWhile general-purpose large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides, they often fall short when faced with tasks requiring deep domain expertise. Many industries require AI systems capable of industry-specific reasoning that can navigate complex, domain-specific scenarios with expert-level understanding.\n\nThe journey to creating AI that truly \"gets\" a particular field goes beyond simply feeding it more data. It requires a targeted approach that focuses on enhancing the model's ability to understand and apply the unique language, concepts, and problem-solving frameworks inherent to a particular field. This is where industry-specific reasoning comes in, and it is the key to unlocking the true potential of AI across sectors like finance, law, medicine, and insurance. By building and using higher quality training data, companies are creating a competitive advantage and opening the door to new opportunities.\n\nThis guide will walk you through the process of generating domain-specific data with the Labelbox data factory to train your LLMs and AI models on industry-specific reasoning. We'll explore real-world examples in finance and law, delve into the intricacies of creating post-training datasets, and provide a step-by-step walkthrough of creating a project in the Labelbox platform. We will also discuss the importance of selecting the right AI trainers and crafting clear instructions and ontology.\n\nBy the end of this guide, you'll be equipped with the knowledge and tools to embark on your own journey toward creating powerful training data to help you build AI models that are not just intelligent, but industry-smart.\n\nExamples of how industry-specific reasoning is becoming a reality\n\nThe power of industry-specific reasoning in AI is not merely theoretical; it's being realized today by forward-thinking companies leveraging advanced tools and expert human insights. Before explaining how to use the Labelbox platform to build a dataset for training models on industry-specific reasons, let's examine two real-world examples where Labelbox has helped clients in the finance and legal sectors expand the capabilities of foundational models.\n\nThese examples showcase how targeted data labeling, guided by domain experts, can enhance an LLM's ability to support different industries. And while each example discusses a specific industry’s use case, we’ll later see how the process and usage of Labelbox can be extended to a much broader range of domains and uses, paving the way for a deeper dive into the practical steps involved in creating your own successful projects.\n\nFinance: Training models on financial analysis\n\nA leading AI lab wanted to improve their LLM’s performance in financial analysis and argumentation. They hoped to train the LLM to provide meaningful insights on any public company when provided a ticker symbol and the latest financial reports of a company. In addition, they wanted the model trained and prepared to answer the most common questions financial analyst might ask.\n\nTo reach this level of financial expertise, they needed training on detailed, domain-specific datasets that were accurately labeled by a team of Chartered Financial Analysts (CFAs) and financial experts. The CFAs needed to have advanced industry knowledge and experience reviewing and analyzing financial models and details.\n\nHowever, they faced two major challenges: (1) sourcing financial experts who could accurately evaluate and rank responses through multi-step analyses, and (2) managing a complex process where each piece of data could take an hour or more to properly analyze and fully label.\n\nThe company turned to Labelbox to help source experts with financial expertise. Labelbox leveraged their Alignerr network of expert human labelers to quickly recruit and onboard a skilled team of financial experts with backgrounds in CFA, MBA, and Masters in Finance. The team built a customized project consisting of a complex ontology, detailed instructions, and numerous attachments per dataset to review and prepare hypothetical questions and scenarios around.\n\nLegal: Automating case evaluation and data discovery\n\nA forward-thinking legal tech company wants to revolutionize how plaintiff firms operate. By using AI-driven tools with industry-specific reasoning, they want to significantly enhance their ability to evaluate cases, analyze key facts and claims, and ultimately deliver results for their clients more efficiently and transparently.\n\nTo achieve this, they needed to imbue their foundational AI model with deep legal expertise, particularly in understanding long legal documents, interpreting insurance and medical bills, and assessing case value.\n\nThe company partnered with Labelbox to create specialized datasets for post-training their model. Labelbox's network of legal experts reviewed a long list of example prompts that were each associated with many multi-page legal documents. They were tasked with identifying key information based on the prompt, crafting well-reasoned responses supported by evidence found in the documents, and evaluating the models responses for accuracy, safety, and reasoning. They were also used to build a dataset based on understanding insurance and medical billing details and learning how to extra the correct details.\n\nSimilar to the finance example above, this project involved creating a custom ontology and using the flexibility of the Labelbox text editor to generate responses to sample prompts from industry experts, identify key data in attached documents, and use their own expertise to properly interpret complex documents.\n\nImportance of high-quality training datasets\n\nThe above finance and legal examples, while distinct in their domain-specific challenges, underscore a fundamental truth about building industry-specific reasoning into AI: the underlying approach remains consistent across industries, whether it's finance, medicine, insurance, or any other specialized field.\n\nAt its core, the process revolves around creating unique and differentiated datasets that capture the specific nuances, knowledge, and reasoning patterns of the target domain. These datasets serve as the bedrock for training models to perform the desired capabilities, enabling them to go beyond general understanding and develop true expertise.\n\nStrategies to remember when planning your project\n\nBefore kicking off a project or starting the process of building a post-training dataset for industry-specific reasoning, organizations should take the time to think through the following steps:\n\nIdentifying key domain-specific competencies required\n\nDefining clear evaluation criteria for expert knowledge\n\nGathering supporting documentation and examples to attach to the project\n\nWriting hypothetical scenarios and questions you want the model to answer\n\nEstablishing metrics for measuring improvement in domain understanding\n\nSetting realistic scope and scale for the training dataset\n\nPreparing a model evaluation process for side-by-side comparisons\n\nThis list may be shortened by some users and for others there may be other key considerations to add; however, we’ve learned that the most successful projects involve advanced planning and often a fair amount of preparation to gather necessary documents, built prompt examples, and think through the key scenarios that require examples and labeled data to sufficiently train the model.\n\nSelecting the right AI trainers\n\nThe next big AI breakthroughs will be fueled by unique, high-quality data. The massive quantity of available data from the internet has been used to train all of the most popular AI models—meaning they all have similar core capabilities and areas of weakness.\n\nTo properly train these models on new domain-specific knowledge and reasoning it’s imperative that we tap into new information and capture data from domain experts. As a result, the focus must be on properly identifying and recruiting AI trainers with unique skills—like the Alignerr network of highly educated industry experts—to label data, generate new responses, evaluate models, and perform critical model post-training alignment tasks.\n\nBased on our experience from leading the Alignerr network and working with AI labs and model builders to form teams of experts, it’s important to keep the following in mind:\n\nDomain expertise: Look for annotators with relevant qualifications, certifications, and experience in the target industry (e.g., CFA, JD, MD).\n\nAnalytical skills: Choose individuals who can demonstrate strong analytical and reasoning abilities.\n\nAttention to detail: Ensure the annotators are meticulous and capable of identifying subtle nuances in the data.\n\nCommunication skills: Select annotators who can clearly articulate their reasoning and provide constructive feedback.\n\nPrevious success metrics: For annotators that have worked on AI training before and used a complete AI platform, then you should be able to review past performance metrics to assist in the evaluations.\n\nAI interviews: Abilities can only be determined so much by reviewing resumes and profiles, so using interviews tailored to their specific background provides the most powerful data.\n\nKey Labelbox features for generating industry-specific training data\n\nHaving outlined strategic considerations to review before starting a project as well as the keys to selecting the right domain experts, the next crucial step is understanding how to operationalize this process efficiently and effectively. This is where a robust and versatile platform like Labelbox becomes indispensable.\n\nLabelbox Platform is an industry-leading software tool with the flexibility and advanced features needed to translate your vision into a concrete, well-structured labeling project tailored for industry-specific reasoning.\n\nFrom selecting the appropriate editor—often the flexible text editor for tasks involving complex analysis and document reviews—to building a comprehensive ontology with a mix of selection tools and free-form text inputs, Labelbox can capture the nuances of your target domain. In addition, the built-in quality assurance and project management capabilities ensure that your project stays on track, maintains high accuracy, and ultimately delivers a dataset that enhances your AI model's performance.\n\nLet's briefly explore the key components of the Labelbox platform that we see used most often in industry-specific reasoning tasks and discuss how they can be leveraged to build the foundation for your industry-specific AI.\n\nData types & editors\n\nLabelbox supports a range of data types, including text, video, image, audio, PDFs, multimodal, and more. For each data type, a customized editor exists to serve as the core interface for labeling that specific data type. While tailored to specific datatypes, the editors are extremely flexible and can be customized to help label and capture the specific data needed for a given industry.\n\nFor most industry-specific reasoning projects, we have seen the core text editor serve as the key editor. It was the editor used in both the finance and legal examples shared earlier. The editor supports these annotation types: entity, relationships, radio classification, checklist classification, and free-form text classification. The latter is often used to capture detailed information and sample responses from domain experts on a given prompt or to provide detailed information on specific information found or extracted from an attached document.\n\nOntology\n\nThe Labelbox ontology defines the structure and categories for labeling data. Ontologies can be reused across different projects and they are required for data labeling, model training, and evaluation. When you are in the editor, the ontology appears in the Tools panel.\n\nOntologies can be customized for any given project and supports classifications, object detection, segmentation, relationships, messaging ranking, prompt rating, step-by-step rating, and more. The available ontology tasks will vary based on the selected editor and data type.\n\nOntologies also allow for hierarchical relationships between classes, allowing you to create complex labeling tasks with detailed information.\n\nQuality assurance\n\nLabelbox offers a suite of quality assurance features to deliver high-quality labeled data, which is particularly crucial when dealing with complex, industry-specific reasoning tasks. Consensus allows you to measure the agreement between multiple labelers on the same data point, providing a statistical measure of confidence in the assigned labels. Benchmarks enable you to incorporate known ground-truth data into your project, allowing you to directly assess labeler accuracy against established standards.\n\nCalibration tools help identify and correct for systematic biases that individual labelers might exhibit, further refining the consistency of your dataset. Moreover, Labelbox Monitor provides real-time insights into your labeling operations, allowing you to track key metrics, identify trends, and quickly spot any outliers in labeler performance. With Monitor, you can proactively address issues and make adjustments as needed, ensuring that your project stays on course.\n\nProject management\n\nLabelbox provides robust project management tools to manage and track your industry-specific reasoning projects from start to finish. Unlike many labeling services and solutions, the Labelbox platform offers transparency into project progress, allowing you to monitor the status of individual tasks, track labeler performance, and gain a clear overview of the entire project's health. Real-time communication features enable seamless interaction with your team of expert labelers, facilitating quick clarification of instructions, addressing questions, and providing feedback directly within the platform.\n\nLabelbox also allows you to build customized workflows tailored to your specific review and quality control processes, ensuring that each piece of data undergoes the appropriate level of scrutiny before being incorporated into your training set. Furthermore, robust data versioning capabilities provide a comprehensive history of all changes made to your data and ontology, allowing for easy rollback if needed and providing a clear audit trail for maintaining data integrity.\n\nCreating an industry-specific reasoning project in Labelbox\n\nHaving explored the core features of the Labelbox platform, let’s examine the key steps to creating and executing on a project to generate new data for training your AI models and apps on industry-specific reasoning.\n\nThis section provides a practical roadmap, walking you through each stage of the process, from crafting clear and comprehensive instructions for your expert labelers to setting up your project within the Labelbox environment, configuring the ideal ontology, managing the labeling operation, and conducting thorough reviews to ensure the highest level of data quality.\n\nUsing these steps as a framework for your project, you can start exploring how the Labelbox Platform can be used for your unique project. You’ll learn what it takes to build a new training dataset for your specific needs.\n\n1. Identify desired outcomes and goals\n\nBefore diving into the mechanics of using Labelbox, it's crucial to establish a clear understanding of your project's objectives. Training frontier models for industry-specific reasoning requires a well-defined target. What specific problem are you trying to solve? What capabilities do you want your model to possess? Answering these questions will guide your data collection and annotation strategy, ultimately determining the success of your project. For example, are you aiming to build a model that can summarize legal documents, predict financial market trends, or diagnose medical conditions? Each of these scenarios demands a different approach to data and annotation.\n\nThis initial phase focuses on defining the desired outcomes and the key capabilities you want your model to achieve. Let's consider a practical example: building a model to assist legal experts in reviewing case files. The desired outcome might be to reduce the time spent on initial case review by automating the identification of key legal arguments and relevant precedents. This translates into key capabilities like: understanding legal terminology, identifying relationships between different parts of a case file, and summarizing complex legal arguments. We need to capture training data that reflects these capabilities. This might include labeled examples of legal arguments, summaries of past cases, and annotations highlighting the relationships between different legal concepts within a document.\n\n2. Write clear instructions\n\nThe quality of your training data hinges on the clarity and completeness of the instructions provided to your AI trainers. Ambiguous guidelines lead to inconsistent annotations, which ultimately undermines the performance of your frontier model. This section outlines the key components of effective instruction design, ensuring your team can accurately and efficiently generate the high-quality data you need.\n\nA comprehensive instruction set begins with a clear overview of the task. Explain the project's overall goal and how the annotations contribute to achieving that goal. Frame the task within the context of the larger project, emphasizing the importance of accurate labeling. For our legal case review example, this overview might explain how the labeled data will train a model to assist lawyers in quickly identifying key information within case files, ultimately saving time and resources.\n\nNext, provide a detailed explanation of the ontology and all relevant terminology. Clearly define each label, category, or rating, avoiding jargon or technical terms that the labelers might not understand. Use simple language and provide real-world examples to illustrate each concept. For instance, instead of simply defining \"legal precedent,\" explain it with a concrete example: \"Legal precedent refers to a previous court decision that serves as a guide for similar cases in the future. For example, the 1954 Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education established a precedent for desegregating public schools.\" Provide multiple examples for each category to cover a range of scenarios. For financial analysis, this might include defining terms like \"bull market,\" \"bear market,\" and \"market volatility,\" each with illustrative examples from real-world financial news.\n\nAddressing edge cases and exceptions is crucial. Anticipate situations where the correct label might be unclear or ambiguous. Provide specific guidance on how to handle these situations. And it’s important to provide guidance on what a trainer should do if they don’t feel qualified or confident in a given task. The instructions should clearly state: \"If you are unsure about the correct label, or if you encounter a situation not covered in these guidelines, do not guess. Instead, flag the case for review by a subject matter expert.\" This emphasis on accuracy over completeness is essential for maintaining data quality.\n\nFinally, establish a clear process for feedback, questions, and clarification. Provide a designated channel for labelers to ask questions, report issues, or suggest improvements to the guidelines. Regularly review and incorporate feedback to refine the instructions and address any ambiguities that arise during the annotation process. This iterative approach ensures that the labeling process becomes more accurate and efficient over time. A well-defined communication channel also empowers labelers to contribute valuable insights based on their experience with the data.\n\n3. Create a new project and select the right editor\n\nYou're ready to create your project within the Labelbox platform. Begin by logging into your Labelbox account. Once logged in, click “Create project.”\n\nThe first step is to select the appropriate data modality or task type for your project. This choice is crucial as it determines the tools and interface available to your labelers. For industry-specific reasoning projects involving long-form text analysis, such as reviewing legal documents or analyzing financial reports, the Text editor is often the most suitable option.\n\nCreate a new project in Labelbox by selecting the appropriate data modality or task type\n\nLabelbox also supports other modalities like image, video, audio, and multimodal chat, allowing you to adapt to various data types. For example, if your project involves evaluating the quality of responses from a large language model in a live chat conversation, you may use the multimodal chat editor. If your project involves processing audio recordings of earnings calls, you may select audio. Select the modality that best reflects the nature of your data.\n\nProvide your project with a descriptive and informative name. This will help you easily identify and manage your project within Labelbox. For our legal case review example, a name like \"Legal Case Review - Contract Analysis\" would be appropriate. For financial analysis, it might be “Financial Report Analysis - Risk Assessment.”\n\nFinally, upload any existing data that you plan to use in the project. Labelbox supports various data formats, making it easy to import your data. This might include PDFs, plain text files, CSV files, or even connections to cloud storage. Consider organizing your data into logical batches or datasets before uploading to simplify project management. While uploading, ensure that your data is properly formatted and structured for optimal use within the Labelbox platform. For large datasets, consider using Labelbox's data import capabilities to streamline the process.\n\n4. Customize your ontology\n\nA well-defined ontology is the backbone of your labeling project. It provides the structure and vocabulary for your AI trainers, ensuring consistency and accuracy in their annotations.\n\nNavigate to the \"Ontology\" tab within your newly created project. This is where you'll define the building blocks of your annotation schema.\n\nExample of an ontology configured to collect both ratings and free responses on a given datarow\n\nClean, thoughtful ontologies help create high-quality labeled data with minimal errors and inconsistencies. Ontologies are an essential part of the Labelbox labeling platform. Every time you create a project or a model in Labelbox, you will need to select an ontology.\n\nAlong with the core objects, classifications, and relationships that you’ll use in the text editor, you can also establish hierarchical relationships between classes if it makes sense for your domain. This allows you to create a more structured and organized ontology. For instance, \"Breach of Contract\" could be a subclass of a more general class called \"Contractual Issue.\" Hierarchical relationships can help your model learn more general concepts from specific examples. They can also make the labeling process more efficient by allowing labelers to quickly navigate through related concepts. For complex ontologies, consider using Labelbox's hierarchical labeling features to simplify the annotation process.\n\nFor most of today’s complex tasks for generative AI, consider incorporating free text fields to capture richer insights from your AI trainers. These fields give the trainers the ability to rewrite prompts or responses, provide detailed feedback, and explain the rationale behind their ratings or labels. This qualitative information can be invaluable for understanding model behavior and improving its performance.\n\nFor instance, a free text field could allow a labeler to explain why they chose a particular label, highlight ambiguities in the data, or suggest improvements to the ontology. This feedback loop is crucial for refining your model and ensuring it aligns with your desired outcomes.\n\n5. Execute the project: label, rate and align\n\nWith your project configured, data loaded, and a robust ontology in place, you're ready to invite your team to begin executing on the tasks and generating new training data.\n\nFirst, invite your selected AI trainers to the project. Labelbox makes it easy to add team members and assign them specific roles. Ensure that each annotator has the necessary training and understands the project's goals, the ontology, and the annotation guidelines. Consider providing a brief onboarding session to familiarize annotators with the Labelbox platform and the specific requirements of your project.\n\nNext, assign data batches to the annotators. Organize your data into manageable batches to streamline the annotation workflow. Labelbox provides tools for batch management, allowing you to distribute data evenly among your team members. Consider assigning smaller batches initially to allow for early feedback and adjustments to the annotation process. As annotators become more proficient, you can increase the batch size.\n\nMonitor the labeling progress regularly. The Labelbox workspace monitor provides dashboards and reporting tools that allow you to track the progress of each annotator and identify any potential bottlenecks or issues. Regular monitoring also allows you to provide timely feedback to annotators and address any questions or concerns they may have. This proactive approach helps maintain data quality and ensures that the project stays on track.\n\nUtilize Consensus, Benchmarks, and Calibration to ensure data quality. These features are essential for maintaining consistency and accuracy in your annotations. Consensus involves having multiple annotators label the same data points and then comparing their annotations. Discrepancies can be discussed and resolved, leading to higher quality data.\n\nBenchmarks are pre-labeled data points that serve as a gold standard for evaluating annotator performance. Regularly testing annotators on benchmarks can help identify areas where they may need additional training or guidance.\n\nCalibration is the process of adjusting the annotation guidelines or training materials based on feedback from annotators and insights gained from consensus and benchmark analysis. This iterative approach ensures that your data quality continuously improves throughout the project lifecycle. By actively managing your team and implementing these quality control measures, you can generate the high-quality training data needed to power your frontier models.\n\n6. Review and perform QA\n\nEven with well-defined instructions and diligent annotators, a robust review process is essential for guaranteeing the highest quality training data.\n\nEstablishing a strong review process within Labelbox allows you to implement multiple layers of quality control. You can configure reviews on a per-project basis, tailoring the process to the specific needs of your task. For example, you might require all annotations to be reviewed by a subject matter expert before being accepted into the training dataset. Alternatively, you could implement a tiered review system, where a subset of annotations are reviewed by a senior annotator, and only those that meet a certain quality threshold are then passed on to a subject matter expert for final review. Labelbox's review workflows can be customized to fit your specific requirements, allowing you to create a scalable and efficient quality control system. Consider implementing a system where annotations are reviewed by a different annotator than the one who originally labeled the data. This helps to catch potential biases or inconsistencies.\n\nBeyond manual review, Labelbox offers AutoQA features that can significantly improve data quality. AutoQA leverages machine learning models to automatically identify potential errors or inconsistencies in your annotations. These features can flag annotations that deviate significantly from the consensus, highlight areas where annotators disagree, or identify annotations that are inconsistent with pre-defined rules or constraints. By proactively identifying potential issues, AutoQA allows you to focus your review efforts on the most critical areas, saving time and resources.\n\nBy combining manual review with AutoQA, you can create a comprehensive quality assurance system that ensures your training data is accurate, consistent, and reliable. This, in turn, will lead to better performing frontier models capable of industry-specific reasoning.\n\nDisrupting your industry with advanced AI capabilities\n\nThe pursuit of AI excellence demands a shift from generic to specialized. As we've explored in this guide, building industry-specific reasoning into LLMs and AI models is not just a technical challenge, but a strategic imperative. By leveraging platforms like Labelbox and embracing a data-centric approach, companies can unlock the true potential of AI and create models that are not just intelligent, but also insightful, reliable, and tailored to the unique demands of their respective industries.\n\nThis guide has provided a roadmap for embarking on this transformative journey. From crafting clear instructions and building robust ontologies to selecting the right AI trainers and leveraging the powerful features of the Labelbox platform, you now have the foundational knowledge to create your own industry-specific reasoning projects. Remember that the key to success lies in a meticulous, iterative approach, where continuous learning and improvement are paramount.\n\nAs you venture forth, keep in mind that the landscape of AI is constantly evolving.

      "# [Products, Competitors, Financials, Employees, Headquarters Locations](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/labelbox)\nSecret to AI profitability is hiring a lot more doctorates\n\nIn India, a radiologist training AI models might earn pay of 100,000 rupees (US$1,200/RM5,312) for a few hours of work, said Hardik Dave, founder and chief executive of Indika AI, a popular data labeling firm. The average contractor makes about a third of that a month, he said. — Reuters In the tiny kingdom of Bhutan, dozens of data experts perfect artificial intelligence models from offices framed by majestic Himalayan peaks. The employees at iMerit aren’t there to train AI in rudimentary tasks like recognising \"brown cat on a windowsill” in an image. Instead, they’re teaching algorithms the anatomy of the human eye or how to detect changes in geospatial maps. Backed by three Silicon Valley billionaires, iMerit is part of a growing cohort of companies building a more sophisticated, monetisable and reliable version of AI, an industry on track to add nearly US$20 trillion (RM88.53 trillion) to the global economy by 2030. As models become smarter, big business is increasingly looking to harness their power for highly specialised tasks, spawning dozens of data services startups devoted to customising applications across sectors like finance, health care and defense. There’s a lot at stake. Even as AI fervour has swept through Silicon Valley, nagging questions persist about whether the technology will actually prove useful enough for businesses around the world to pay up for it and ensure that AI model developers can turn a profit. Of course, Nvidia Corp has become the most valuable company in the world by selling AI chips. But the firm’s biggest customers, including Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc, are still losing money from the immense cost of building more advanced AI systems. Radha Basu, the founder and chief executive officer of iMerit, drew a parallel to software coders who built the Internet, mobile phones and other modern tech platforms. \"We’re coder equivalents of the AI revolution,” said the grey-haired entrepreneur, who’s preparing to raise her next round of funding. Getting AI to advanced proficiency in unrelated, sensitive and sometimes dangerous industries won’t be easy. The undertaking requires a deep bench of human experts willing to add to their day jobs by training and improving models in technical fields. In Kenya, a startup is developing technology to scan the bush for signs of poachers. In Kazakhstan, medical experts are teaching models to identify the early stages of lung cancer. In India, Korea, Vietnam and elsewhere, linguists earning US$65 (RM287) an hour are helping models become proficient in languages other than English. At iMerit, which employs 5,000 people in Bhutan, India and New Orleans, Yeshi Wangmo, 23, who hails from a family of farmers, has spent years mastering a single task: correctly identifying weeds and debris in images of vast fields of corn and cotton. Wangmo and her colleagues, dressed in colourful Bhutanese gho and kira wraps, help companies like Blue River Technology, a subsidiary of Deere & Co, build algorithms that improve accuracy when spraying pesticides and fertilisers, reducing use by as much as 90%. \"We are seeing companies tackle more advanced but also increasingly niche problems,” said Ivan Lee, founder and CEO of data labeling solutions firm Datasaur Inc, whose customers include Netflix Inc and the FBI. \"Clients may need dentists who grew up in Tanzania or architects from France,” said Lee, whose teams mainly work out of Indonesia. Data accuracy is the lodestar of their work. When ChatGPT was launched two years ago, critics were quick to pick apart the platform’s flaws and lapses. Since then, scores of human experts have been hired for quality control. The work is painstaking. Data labelers like Wangmo pore over scans, photos, video and text to ready AI models. The goal is to improve generative AI systems that are trained on vast data sets to analyse or create new content. Perfecting them removes the discrepancy between potential capabilities of AI and its actual performance in the real world. Such specialisation is increasingly key in high-stakes sectors like those that deal with military intelligence, according to Kathleen Walch, director and general manager at the research firm PMI Cognilytica. Lower-level versions of this work aren’t new. The data services industry began about two decades ago. Back then, labellers living in places like the Philippines and India primarily tagged small data sets that underpinned, for instance, speech recognition for voice assistants or search engines on shopping websites. Critics worry that AI has created an exploitable underclass, pointing to salaries that hover around a few dollars a day in some pockets of the industry. But over the years, as AI has improved, much of the simpler stuff is now automated. Demand has shifted to recruiting specialists and paying higher salaries and rates, though they’re still considerably lower than compensation packages for data scientists in Silicon Valley. In India, a radiologist training AI models might earn pay of 100,000 rupees (US$1,200/RM5,312) for a few hours of work, said Hardik Dave, founder and chief executive of Indika AI, a popular data labeling firm. The average contractor makes about a third of that a month, he said. Today, startups selling labeling services attract marquee investors. This summer, the largest player, Scale AI, raised money from Meta Platforms Inc and Amazon.com Inc. With a nearly US$14bil (RM62bil) valuation, the company has vaulted past the figures for prominent AI model builders like Mistral and Cohere. In 2023, Sequoia’s list of the top 50 AI companies featured four labeling startups, up from just one the previous year. One firm, Labelbox, is backed by Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins. Another, Snorkel AI, is funded by Alphabet Inc.’s venture arm at a valuation of US$1bil (RM4.42bil). More broadly, the market for data labellers, valued at nearly US$20bil (RM89bil) in 2024, is projected to grow around 20% annually until 2030, according to Grand View Research, a market research firm based in San Francisco. The consequences of a misstep are also weightier. A mislabeled frame could cost a business millions of dollars, inviting lawsuits or even causing death. Cancer-scanning AI tools or self-driving cars are two sensitive areas. \"Less accurate AI can go off the rails,” said Wendy Gonzalez, CEO of the Los Gatos-based Sama, whose clients include Ford Motor Co. and Walmart Inc. \"Businesses can’t afford that.” Consider the tie-up between Massachusetts General Hospital and Centaur Labs, a data labeling startup with 50,000 freelancers based in countries including the US, Kazakhstan and Vietnam. In recent years, Boston-based Centaur Labs has improved products used in the hospital, gradually bringing in higher-skilled data experts. Some are related to everyday maladies. (The startup is working on a snore-detection algorithm and an app for sleep apnea.) Others stray into heavier topics like developing AI that can more precisely identify lung nodules in CT scans. Last month, the startup announced an injection of capital from Accel, Y Combinator and others. Polina Pilius, a radiologist in Kazakhstan who oversees teams for a contractor of Centaur Labs, said the work keeps getting narrower. Today, she said, it’s not enough to merely detect lung nodules. Clients increasingly want specialized features that reduce the number of false positives and track the growth of nodules over time. Reducing risk without cutting corners is the sweet spot. \"Medical data annotation is a complex process that cannot tolerate haste, incompetence, inattention or excessive cost-cutting,” Pilius said. Despite all that can go wrong, AI’s proponents argue that training models to tackle complex issues in risky sectors is preferable to doing nothing. In many instances, there’s only upside, they say. Labelbox, the San Francisco-based startup, works with a client that sells dash cam analysis to companies overseeing hundreds of thousands of trucks. Over the past year, Labelbox data specialists have trained AI bots to become even more expert at monitoring whether a driver is drowsy or inebriated. Once detected, fleet operators are alerted and the driver is contacted. Manu Sharma, the CEO of Labelbox, said this is just one example where models are doing more than simply cutting costs or improving efficiency. The best technology is life-saving, he said, and data labelers are on the front-line of advancing AI’s capabilities. They’re \"creating a world in which their expertise is more accessible and can be applied to benefit society,” he said. – Bloomberg Open Modal",
      "# [Google Slashes Gemini Prices, Boosts Performance of AI Models by PYMNTS, www.facebook.com on 2024-09-24](https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2024/google-slashes-prices-upgrades-boosts-performance-ai-models/)\nGoogle’s latest artificial intelligence models could accelerate AI adoption in eCommerce and retail, developers say, as the tech giant unveils upgrades designed to attract more businesses to its Gemini platform.\n\nThe company announced two updated production-ready models in a Tuesday (Sept. 24) blog post, Gemini-1.5-Pro-002 and Gemini-1.5-Flash-002, which offer enhanced capabilities across a range of tasks, including product recommendations, inventory management and customer service automation.\n\n“The new release introduces advanced capabilities in math and vision tasks,” Sujan Abraham, a senior software engineer at AI firm Labelbox, told PYMNTS. “These models are designed for a wide range of tasks, including text, code and multimodal applications. They can process larger and much more complex inputs like 1,000-page PDFs, massive code repos and hour-long videos. These models are faster, better and more cost-efficient for production environments.”\n\nPrice Cuts and Performance Boost\n\nIn a move likely to intensify competition in the AI market, Google is reducing pricing for its Gemini-1.5-Pro model by more than 50% for both input and output on prompts under 128,000 tokens. The company is also doubling rate limits for the 1.5 Flash model and tripling them for 1.5 Pro.\n\n“To make it even easier for developers to build with Gemini, we are increasing the paid tier rate limits for 1.5 Flash to 2,000 RPM and increasing 1.5 Pro to 1,000 RPM, up from 1,000 and 360, respectively,” the post stated.\n\nPerformance improvements are up, with Google reporting an approximate 7% increase in scores on the MMLU-Pro benchmark, which measures general knowledge and reasoning abilities. Both models showed a “considerable ~20% improvement” on math-related benchmarks, according to the post.\n\n“The Gemini 1.5 series is more efficient across the board,” Jorge Argota, founder of an AI consultancy, told PYMNTS. “These models are text, code and multimodal. When dealing with complex math or code, they are more understanding and accurate. This could be a game changer for eCommerce platforms looking to implement advanced AI features.”\n\nArgota highlighted the extended context window as a significant advancement.\n\n“The models can now process up to 2 million tokens, which is a big jump from previous versions,” he said. “This means they can handle long documents and multimedia inputs with ease. For projects with large datasets or long documents, this is a huge win.”\n\nNew Features\n\nThe updates also address speed and efficiency concerns.\n\n“Along with core improvements to our latest models, over the last few weeks we have driven down the latency with 1.5 Flash and significantly increased the output tokens per second, enabling new use cases with our most powerful models,” Google’s blog post said.\n\nArgota noted several key new features, including “Gems, personalized AI assistants,” which allows users to create custom AI assistants for specific tasks. He also mentioned the Imagen 3 model, “an advanced image generation model that produces higher quality images from text prompts,” and Gemini Live, which enhances conversational AI interactions through voice conversations.\n\nThe price reductions and increased rate limits are expected to impact businesses.\n\n“The 15% price drop and increased rate limits is a big win for businesses looking to add AI to their workflows,” Argota said. “The cost savings makes these advanced models more affordable, especially for startups and small businesses that were hesitant to get in due to budget constraints.”\n\nGoogle’s push to make its AI models more attractive to developers comes as competition in the sector intensifies, with rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic also vying for market share.\n\nThe company is betting that these improvements will encourage more developers to build applications using Gemini, potentially leading to broader adoption of Google’s AI technologies.\n\n“We continue to be blown away with the creative and useful applications of Gemini 1.5 Pro’s 2 million token long context window and multimodal capabilities,” the blog post said. “From video understanding to processing 1,000-page PDFs, there are so many new use cases still to be built.”\n\nIn addition to the production models, Google is releasing an experimental version called “Gemini-1.5-Flash-8B-Exp-0924,” which the post said includes “significant performance increases across both text and multimodal use cases.”\n\nThe updates also include changes to the models’ default filter settings, giving developers more control over content moderation.\n\n“For the models released today, the filters will not be applied by default so that developers can determine the configuration best suited for their use case,” the post said.\n\nAs the AI arms race continues, Google’s latest move signals its commitment to remaining competitive in a rapidly evolving market. With these enhancements, the company aims to solidify its position as a provider of AI tools for developers and businesses.\n\n“Overall, a big win for businesses looking to add AI to their workflows,” Argota said.",

Although traditionally dominated by Windows, the increasing acceptance rate of Mac devices offers a fertile ground for expansion. As of 2023, Apple reports over 100 million active Mac users globally. This substantial user base comprises professionals in creative industries, academia, and technology sectors, many of whom are engaged in machine learning and data science projects requiring robust data annotation tools.\n\nKey consumers driving the demand for data annotation tools on Mac OS include AI researchers, developers, and tech-savvy professionals who prefer the Mac ecosystem for its reliability and performance. The introduction of Apple Silicon, with the M1 and M2 chips, has significantly enhanced the computational capabilities of Mac devices. In 2023, Apple announced that over 25 million Macs are powered by Apple Silicon, providing users with powerful machines suitable for resource-intensive tasks like data annotation. The tight integration between Mac hardware and software results in optimized performance for applications, including those used for annotating large datasets.\n\nThe growth outlook for Mac OS in the data annotation tools market is promising. Developers are increasingly recognizing the need to cater to Mac users, leading to the release of popular annotation tools compatible with Mac OS, such as Labelbox and Supervisely. The Mac App Store, featuring over 30,000 applications as of 2023, serves as a convenient distribution channel for these tools.\n\nRequest For Customization: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/ask-for-customization/data-annotation-tools-market\n\nTop 5 Players Hold Over 17% Market Share, Shows Fragmented Market\n\nThe competitive landscape of the global data annotation tools market is marked by fragmentation, with numerous companies vying for market share without a clear leader. The top five players—Lionbridge Technologies, D-Link, Appen Limited, Cogito Tech LLC, and CloudFactory Limited—collectively capture just over 17% of the total market share. This dispersion indicates that while these companies are influential, they do not dominate the market, allowing for a dynamic environment where smaller and emerging firms can compete effectively. The relatively low collective market share of the top players highlights significant opportunities for innovation and niche specialization within the industry.\n\nThis fragmentation is driven by the diverse and evolving demands of various sectors that rely on data annotation. Industries such as healthcare, automotive, retail, and technology require specialized annotation services, leading to the rise of numerous providers catering to specific needs. For example, some companies in the data annotation tools market focus exclusively on annotating medical images for healthcare applications, while others specialize in data for autonomous vehicles. This specialization enables smaller companies to carve out significant market segments, contributing to overall competitiveness and preventing any single entity from monopolizing the market.\n\nTechnological advancements and the increasing adoption of AI and ML further influence the market's competitive dynamics. As organizations recognize the critical role of high-quality annotated data in training AI models, the demand for advanced annotation tools grows. Companies are continually innovating to offer better services, integrating features like automation, quality control, and seamless integration with AI workflows. This continuous innovation cycle keeps the market highly competitive, with new entrants challenging established players. The fragmented nature of the data annotation tools market reflects the dynamic and rapidly evolving landscape of the AI industry, fostering an environment where competition drives progress and innovation.\n\nKey Companies:\n\nAnnotate.com\n\nAppen Limited\n\nCloud Factory Limited\n\nCloudApp\n\nCogito Tech LLC\n\nDeep Systems\n\nGoogle Inc.\n\nLabelbox, Inc\n\nLightTag\n\nLionbridge Technologies, Inc.\n\nLotus Quality Assurance\n\nPlayment Inc.\n\nTagtog Sp.zo.\n\nOther Prominent Players\n\nKey Segmentation:\n\nBy Data Type:\n\nText\n\nSentiment\n\nText Classification\n\nEntity\n\nImage\n\nBoundary Boxes\n\nLine Annotation\n\nImage Transcription\n\nVideo\n\nSemantic\n\nPolygon\n\nKey point\n\nAudio\n\nVoice Activity Detection (VAD)\n\nSpeaker Identification\n\nAutomated Speech Recognition\n\nBy Technology:\n\nSupervised\n\nSemi-Supervised\n\nAutomatic\n\nBy Device Type:\n\nMac OS\n\nWindows\n\nLinux\n\nOthers\n\nBy End Users:\n\nAutomotive\n\nHealthcare\n\nRetail\n\nTransportation and logistics\n\nBFSI\n\nTelecommunication and IT\n\nOthers\n\nBy Region:\n\nNorth America\n\nEurope\n\nAsia Pacific\n\nMiddle East & Africa (MEA)\n\nSouth America\n\nFor more information about this report visit: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/industry-report/data-annotation-tools-market\n\nAbout Astute Analytica\n\nAstute Analytica is a global analytics and advisory company which has built a solid reputation in a short period, thanks to the tangible outcomes we have delivered to our clients.

      "# [Engaging Citizen Scientists in Biodiversity Monitoring: Insights from the WildLIVE! Project by René Meißner, Merlin Weiß, Yannet Condori, Gabriel Aramayo-Ledezma, Jonas Grieb, Alexander Wolodkin, José Luis Aramayo-Bejarano, Martin Jansen, Maya Beukes, Claus Weiland](https://theoryandpractice.citizenscienceassociation.org/articles/10.5334/cstp.665)\nIntroduction\n\nTo recognize and react to the increasing local anthropogenic effects on nature at an early stage, constant monitoring of the environment is necessary (Rajkumar et al. 2010). Autonomous devices such as camera traps offer a wide range of options for accessible and non-invasive biomonitoring (Steenweg et al. 2017; Rudolfi and Poerting 2020); however, they generate large volumes of data, which can be difficult to manage (Norouzzadeh et al. 2018). With the increasing utilization of camera traps (Green et al. 2020) and audio recorders (Mutanu et al. 2022), the amount of stored data (images, videos, acoustic data) collected is rapidly expanding. Scientists and conservationists need to meet the challenge of processing such data streams, and if possible, in real time, which is essential for nature conservation issues such as anti-poaching (Tan et al. 2016; Heyns 2021) and detecting biodiversity trends at a local and global scale (Chandler et al. 2017; Steenweg et al. 2017). Although there are approaches for effective data processing using machine learning, they require large, annotated (“labeled”) training data sets, which are very time-consuming to create (Norouzzadeh et al. 2018; Schneider, Taylor and Kremer 2018). Moreover, machine learning–derived image classifications by existing open source tools or public platforms are still largely imprecise and require human verification (Vélez et al. 2023). Thus, the contribution of citizen science (CS) at the interface of data collection and AI-based processing of camera trap and other ecological data has large potential (Fraisl et al. 2022) and is fostered by new, more accessible, and inexpensive technologies (Silvertown 2009; Adler, Green, and Şekercioğlu 2020). Here, we use the term “citizen science” to describe scientific work that has been conducted in whole or in part by amateur (or nonprofessional) scientists, often in collaboration with professional scientists or institutions (Green et al. 2020). CS projects can be broadly categorized based on the extent of public involvement, with classifications including contractual, contributory, collaborative, co-created, and collegial (Bonney et al. 2009; Shirk et al. 2012; Green et al. 2020).\n\nIn 2017, we initiated a biomonitoring study using camera traps to gain more information about the diverse but understudied mammalian fauna of the endemic Chiquitano Dry Forest (CDF). The CDF represents the largest block of tropical broad-leaf dry forest in South America (Miles et al. 2006; Power et al. 2016). Today, the Chiquitano region faces significant anthropogenic pressure as it has been transformed from forest into a mixed-use landscape. The CDF is experiencing a rapid reduction in size, largely attributable to deforestation, which is occurring at an average rate of 108,000 hectares per year, resulting in a 15% loss of its original extent from 2001 to 2006 (Killeen et al. 2006). Additionally, human-induced wildfires have further exacerbated the decline, with a notable instance in 2019 where 12% of the forests were destroyed (Romero-Muñoz et al. 2019). In our own studies, we have documented large-scale habitat destruction since 2020, focusing on the effects of rapid land use change and deforestation on mammal communities, that is, the actual biodiversity loss or population declines (Jansen et al. 2020; Meißner et al. 2024). To process the large volumes of image data that derived from the camera trapping since 2017, in 2020 we initiated the contributory CS project WildLIVE! (“WildLIVE! Entdecke die wilden Tiere Boliviens;” Jansen 2021). In WildLIVE!, citizen scientists analyze large amounts of camera trap images using the platform Labelbox (Labelbox 2021). Similar to other studies on CS projects, we identified that participant motivation and engagement are paramount to the success of our CS project (Lotfian, Ingensand, and Brovelli 2020). Here, we describe our more than three years of experience concerning citizen engagement, challenges, and outcomes. We explore the quality and quantity of the engagement of our participants, in particular the motivation to contribute to a CS project that, on the one hand, is dealing with positive aspects of biodiversity (e.g., fascinating insights into wilderness), and on the other hand, with actual biodiversity loss (deforestation and wildfires). Moreover, we present strategies that we believe proved to be key to the success of this project. Lastly, we provide an outlook on the planned future development of the project.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nStudy area\n\nWildLIVE! is focused on data obtained from an ongoing camera trap biomonitoring project in the Chiquitano region, Bolivia, which was initiated in March 2017 (Jansen et al. 2020). Since its initiation, the monitored area was gradually expanded, and today comprises 25 camera trap stations, covering approximately 23,025 ha (Supplemental File 1: Figure 1). Each station was equipped with two (paired) cameras. This setup aimed to enhance the detection and identifiability of jaguars and other species based on individual coat patterns on each body side, with the jaguar as the focal species. For more details, please refer to former descriptions of the study site (Schulze et al. 2009) or the field methodology (Jansen et al. 2020) and analysis (Meißner et al. 2024).\n\nWildLIVE! Development and construction\n\nThe WildLIVE! project is structured as follows (Supplemental File 2: Figure 2): Data is collected by camera traps and is subsequently pre-processed (e.g., long runs of empty images or images with humans present are removed) and then uploaded to the external web based platform Labelbox, a closed-source web-based labeling platform frequently used to create training data sets for machine learning applications (Labelbox 2021). Participants register for WildLIVE! through the landing page (see Jansen 2021), and are subsequently added to Labelbox. Labelbox granted us an extended free educational license for non-commercial research purposes. The platform allows for the development of a customizable interface for the manual classification of images, and subsequently, further inspection by other users. Upon registration, participants gain access to view the camera trap images online, accompanied by an integrated tutorial that was developed in collaboration with experienced participants (Jansen et al. 2021) to assist with species identification. Citizen scientists process images by assigning them to predefined categories or annotations, for example a species name, or as “empty” (referred to as “blanks” in other projects). If an image is found to contain one or more animal(s), a bounding box is drawn around each individual and is then assigned an identification (Figure 1). For the purpose of this paper, we use the term “label” for a classified image, in contrast to the various “annotations” that participants use to classify each image. For more details about “quality control” please refer to Supplemental File 3: Appendix 1.\n\nTo obtain an index of biodiversity, we used camera trap data collected between January 2017 and December 2021. For the consensus of image classifications that did not have a unanimous label classification, the image classifications made by “expert reviewers” were accepted, and for images not reviewed, classifications that reached a consensus of 70% or higher were accepted (Adam et al. 2021; Hsing et al. 2022). The resulting extensive data resource is being used for scientific analysis and as input to train an AI model for future classification aid.\n\nCitizen scientists’ engagement and motivators\n\nThe research utilized a mixed-methods approach, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data to explore participants’ attitudes towards and involvement in WildLIVE!. To identify citizen scientist participation and engagement, we analyzed user data obtained from our online landing page and Labelbox. Participation was measured as the number of registrations over time between 5 April 2020 and 5 April 2023. Engagement was measured based on user data collected by Labelbox (“Created At,” “Seconds to Create,” “Seconds to Review,” “Created By;” for more details, refer to Supplemental File 3: Appendix 1).\n\nQuantitative data were collected through a two-part questionnaire titled “Meine Teilnahme an WildLIVE!” (refer to Supplemental File 4: Appendix 2 for a more detailed description of its content and methodology) to understand the perceptions, motivations, and expectations of participants. The original version of the questionnaire was in German, but translated subsequently into English by two bilingual researchers in the subject matter who are fluent in both languages. This approach ensured that the nuances and contextual meanings of the questions were preserved (Bradley 1994).\n\nThe questionnaire was developed using a construct-centered approach (Messick 1995), ensuring that it accurately captured the constructs of interest. In the first section of the questionnaire, Part A, participants expressed their level of agreement with motivational statements crafted from ad-hoc email feedback received from citizen scientists. These statements were presented on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (do not relate) to 6 (strongly related; Zanbar and Ellison 2019). Motivational statements were carefully selected to be representative of the feedback received and to be aligned with the five constructs of knowledge and understanding, engagement and commitment, personal benefits and enjoyment, community and advocacy, and emotional response (Santori et al. 2021; Kim, Chan, and Gupta 2007; for examples of participants’ feedback via emails, see Supplemental File 5: Appendix 3).\n\nPart B of the questionnaire offered open-ended questions to capture narrative responses, allowing for a richer understanding of participants’ experiences with WildLIVE! (see Supplemental File 3: Appendix 1 for more details). We carried out all analyses in R 3.6.1 (R Core Team, 2023) if not specified otherwise.\n\nResults\n\nCitizen science participation, engagement, and the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe WildLIVE! initiative was launched on 4 April 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as part of several other CS projects at the Senckenberg Institute for Biodiversity Research (Senckenberg 2023). Until 4 April 2023, 858 participants had registered. Active participants donated more than 8,938 hours of work, which equates to 1,117.3 working days or 4.98 years (assuming a 40-hour work week including German public holidays and vacation). In total, 108,198 images were processed with 10 to 11 classification iterations, resulting in 976,268 image classifications (labels) with an estimated 1,500,000 annotations assigned by citizen scientists.\n\nThe participants’ engagement had an intrinsic pattern affected by the national lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic (Supplemental File 6: Figure 3). Sudden spikes in registrations and engagement can be attributed to public outreach activities by us such as social media posts, print media articles, radio interviews, etc., as well as group registrations by university students during courses or school class registrations (Figure 2a). Bottlenecks in the upload of data in the initial phase caused a negative impact on citizen scientists’ engagement (Supplemental File 6: Figure 3).\n\nOut of the 858 registered participants, 504 (59%) actively contributed to the classifications. The image classification–to–participant ratio was 1,937:1. The extent of the active citizen scientists’ contributions varied between 1 and 97,403 labels each (mean 1,943). Notably, a small number of participants were responsible for the majority of classifications: While 158 of the 504 active participants (31%) classified less than 100 images each, the most active 10% (50 individuals) contributed to 78% (n = 763,622) of all image classifications (labels). The top three participants alone accounted for an impressive number of labels, with individual throughputs of 97,403, 62,636, and 57,092 labels respectively (Figure 2b).\n\nAnalysis of taxonomic classifications\n\nThe taxonomic classifications for 42,088 images containing mammals were assigned by at least 10 or 11 different citizen scientists. Of these images, 29,437 (69.9%) were identified unanimously to species level. For 10,314 images (24.5%) with non-unanimous labels, the identification of expert reviewers was accepted. There were 1,437 images (3.4%) that were not reviewed by expert reviewers for which an identification was accepted if a consensus of 70% or higher was reached. 900 images (2.1%) that did not yield a consensus were discarded from this study.\n\nOverall we recorded 24 mammalian species representing the native trophic structure including apex-predators (puma, jaguar), meso-carnivores (ocelots, jaguarundi, margays), large herbivores (tapir, collared and white lipped peccary), and small mammals (agouti, tamandua, nine-banded armadillo; Jansen et al. 2020). Because of the vulnerability of large carnivores to population decline and local extinction caused by habitat loss, we conducted a separate study (Meißner et al. 2024) focussing on the jaguar (Panthera onca). The study involved characterizing the life histories of 15 individuals and inferred four reproduction events between March 2017 to December 2019. The results of this separate study, which also determined a massive (33%) reduction of dense forest cover, provides strong evidence of the anthropogenic pressure on the CDF, and the imminent threat of habitat destruction in the Chiquitano region.\n\nCitizen scientists’ motivations, incentives, and benefits\n\nOut of 858 registered users, 504 were active participants, with 121 (24%) responding to the questionnaire. Participants predominantly expressed positive sentiments about their involvement in the WildLIVE! project, as reflected in the weighted average responses across construct themes. The constructs with the most positive responses were “Engagement and Commitment” (86.3% weighted average of positive responses for this construct), “Knowledge and Understanding” (83%), and “Emotional Responses” (78.4%). Responses in “Personal Benefits and Enjoyment” and “Community and Advocacy” were also positive, though to a lesser extent (68.7% and 55.6% respectively). The motivational statements with the three highest weighted averages of positive responses were (1) “gives me insights into wilderness” (92%), (2) “is a lot of fun” (91%), and (3) “is meaningful to me because I can support current research”, and “expands my knowledge on biological taxa/species” (89% for both, Figure 3; for presentation of responses presented on 6-point Likert scale, please refer to Supplemental File 7: Figure 4).The majority (85%) of participants expressed interest in continuing with the project, especially if new elements were introduced.\n\nConversely, there is also evidence that the project affects the participants in a negative way, with 83% feeling saddened by the observed biodiversity loss. Interestingly, 79% of participants had their first experience with CS through the WildLIVE! project. Yet, the project did not significantly improve awareness about other CS projects (25%) or contribute to reducing the feeling of wanderlust (35%; Figure 3).\n\nIn part B of the questionnaire, participants used a total of 3,127 words in the open-ended questions to describe their involvement, of which 467 were unique. Sentiment analysis revealed 69 positive, 31 negative, and 367 neutral words. The most frequently used words by participants to describe their experience were positive or neutral, including “knowledge” (75%), “interesting” (72%), “meaningful” (71%), “exciting” (63%) and “fascinating” (56%) (Table 1). Negative sentiments were reflected by the choice of words such as “monotonous” (26%), “exhausting” (23%), and “sad” (10%), as well as in personal communications conveying a decrease in motivation as a result of frustration about biodiversity loss (Figure 4; Supplemental File 8: Appendix D). These findings underscore the varied impact of WildLIVE!, from educational benefits to emotional challenges associated with conservation efforts (Table 1; Figure 3; see also Supplemental File 8: Appendix D).\n\nPOSITIVEOCC.PART.NEUTRALOCC.PART.NEGATIVEOCC.PART.exciting13363species15980monotonous3726meaningful12971knowledge13875sad1310interesting10272nature11361frustrated119useful6552fascinating7156boring76enthusiastic6452research6652lonely54important5948discover6552upset43curious5947conservation6450angry43love5343science6248tiring43fun5038protection5845tedious22satisfying4738ecology5242confused22\n\nDiscussion\n\nLaunching WildLIVE!\n\nVirtual science projects have gained significant attention and utilization in biodiversity research, presenting an innovative and cost-effective approach to gathering and analyzing data. Participants are offered the opportunity to contribute to in-situ surveys, encompassing a variety of ecosystems and species, from freshwater habitats and avian populations to plant life (Rose et al. 2020; Dwivedi 2021; Ramvilas et al. 2021). They also facilitate ex-situ surveys in a digital space, where volunteers can assist, for example, in the classification of camera trap images and videos, such as “chimp&see,” “Snapshot Serengeti,” and “Wildlife Insights” (Swanson et al. 2015; Arandjelovic et al. 2016; Ahumada et al. 2020).\n\nFor most people, the COVID-19 pandemic demanded a shift from in-person nature observation to digital nature observation and may have changed how humans relate to the natural environment by driving us to observe nature from a more distant position (Poerting and Rudolfi 2021). A number of digital interactive projects such as BirdTrack (Shoesmith et al. 2021) and COVID-19 Sounds (Han et al. 2022) were launched as a result of the pandemic, and existing platforms such as eBird and iNaturalist (Kishimoto et al 2021; Sánchez-Clavijo et al. 2021) saw a marked increase in participation. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, WildLIVE! was developed to offer opportunities for remote participation in biodiversity research, catering to the increased number of individuals seeking engagement from home during lockdown periods. In the context of this study, a “lockdown period” is defined based on the official restrictions imposed in Germany, where the study was conducted. These lockdown periods typically included government-mandated stay-at-home orders, closure of non-essential businesses, and restrictions on public gatherings.\n\nIt is important to note that while our analysis primarily draws upon the lockdown in Germany, we acknowledge the potential global reach of the WildLIVE! platform. Therefore, we do not assume that all participants are German or residing in Germany; however, the peaks in participant engagement from our data closely align with the lockdown periods in Germany, suggesting an impact of these restrictions on participation levels. Future studies could extend this analysis to examine the relationship between participant engagement and lockdown periods in other countries, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how global events and local policies influence digital CS participation.\n\nWhile Labelbox provides a robust and reliable platform, it is important to highlight that it is a closed-source software. Therefore, risks are introduced such as vendor lock-in and limited interoperability, which might be significant considerations for some projects. Other platforms such as Zooniverse (www.zooniverse.org), eMammal (emammal.si.edu), and Agouti (agouti.eu) are open-source and potentially provide researchers with greater flexibility and control over their own projects. By opting for open-source solutions in the future, researchers can mitigate the risks associated with proprietary software platforms, fostering a more adaptable and resilient project environment.\n\nAt the moment, WildLIVE! is making use of the Labelbox platform to host the project until we have finished developing our own custom platform. This will be a combination of archive, analysis, and CS on one portal where data sets will be open source to enable open source research and CS according to the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016) and as described further in the section “Conclusion and Outlook.” One major benefit of the planned platform will be the open source availability of labeled camera trap datasets to train machine learning algorithms for automated classification.\n\nCitizen science engagement and motivation\n\nWe found that the top 10% of participants (i.e., the 50 most active) contributed to 79% of image classifications (Figure 2b). This aligns with the outcomes of similar CS projects. For example, Sauermann and Franzoni (2015) analyzed participant engagement data across several projects and found that the majority of participants engaged only once, with minimal effort, whereas a small percentage of the participants contributed the greatest effort. The same trend was observed in the project MammalWeb (Hsing et al. 2022). However, in comparison with similar projects, WildLIVE! has a relatively high image-classification-to-participant ratio (~1,900:1) relative to MammalWeb (~550:1), and Snapshot Serengeti (~43:1), with 1.2 million images for 28,000 participants (Hsing et al. 2018; Swanson et al. 2016). On the one hand, this shows a huge potential for growth of WildLIVE! in terms of participant numbers in comparison with similar projects. On the other hand, it demonstrates a strong commitment resulting in heavy engagement of single participants. Approximately a year after the launch of WildLIVE!, the cumulative number of labels generated exceeded the number of participant registrations (Figure 2a), evidencing this strong engagement and activity by our participants.\n\nSeveral studies have indicated the positive impacts of CS projects, including direct personal benefits and other broader outcomes such as behavioral alterations (see Green et al. 2020 for a review). Through involvement in CS projects, participants can increase their knowledge about the topics researched (Masters et al. 2016; Forrester et al. 2017), and provide a sense of purpose and community (Curtis 2015; Domroese and Johnson 2017). While we did not conduct an extensive or systematic survey on the underlying motivations of our participants, we received valuable personal feedback through our questionnaire, as well as through ad hoc email correspondence (see some examples in Supplemental File 5: Appendix 3). The results of our questionnaire indicate that the primary motivations of our participants, reflected by the statements “insights into wilderness, “expands my knowledge,” and “meaningful” align predominately with the categories of “Engagement and Commitment,” followed by “Knowledge and Understanding” and “Emotional Responses.” The words most commonly used by participants to describe their involvement in WildLIVE! include “knowledge,” “species,” “exciting,” and “interesting.” This reinforces the idea that understanding and knowledge, purposeful engagement, and enjoyment are key drivers motivating our participants, and suggests that our participants appear to be driven primarily by a desire for intellectual growth and emotional fulfillment.\n\nConversely, some participants are affected in a negative way, feeling saddened by the observed biodiversity loss. Involvement in the project has also been described as “monotonous” and “exhausting.” While their engagement in WildLIVE! represented the first interaction with CS for most participants, it did not improve their awareness about other CS projects or reduced the feeling of wanderlust. Our participants are becoming increasingly concerned about habitat destruction occurring in or nearby our study area, and occasionally reported a resulting decrease in motivation. Unfortunately, this is in line with other studies reporting on a growing body of evidence relating to emotional distress responses arising from perceptions on environmental change in society (Cianconi et al. 2022).\n\nAttract new and retain existing participants\n\nIn our experience, the two major challenges in the WildLIVE! project are (1) to attract new participants and (2) to retain existing and experienced users. To draw new participants, social media platforms are crucial for the distribution of information about the project (Liberatore et al. 2018). To promote our project, our institution’s public relations department used social media platforms such as Facebook (facebook.com/SenckenbergWorld), Twitter (twitter.com/Senckenberg), and Instagram (instagram.com/SenckenbergWorld), as well as newsletters through the mailing list for members of the Senckenberg society. WildLIVE! also has its own webpage (Jansen 2021), which is linked to several public portals for CS (Bürger Schaffen Wissen; engagement jetzt!; GoVolunteer). Important but somewhat ad hoc is the outreach gained through mainstream media coverage, for example, print media or radio interviews. These spontaneous mainstream media exposure events are usually followed by a sudden increase in participant registrations (Figure 2a).\n\nTo enhance the retention and engagement of participants already registered in the WildLIVE! project, we implemented a variety of strategies, which have demonstrated promising results. Below, we describe these strategies along with practical examples of how they were applied:\n\nPositive introduction: Providing a welcoming tutorial and introductory email helps create a positive first impression, setting the tone for participant involvement.\n\nPersonal care: Responding personally to emails, inquiries, and telephone calls from participants demonstrates our commitment to their positive experience, fostering a supportive community.\n\nDynamic and enriching experience: Facilitating digital access allows for time-flexible engagement, while providing content related to biodiversity and conservation keeps the experience relevant and educational. For example, we put effort into creating a dynamic home page, including news about the study area and an online museum of selected photographs.\n\nOwnership and purpose: Encouraging co-design of project aspects, such as writing specific aspects of the tutorial (many participants intrinsically offered to write species identification keys), and participation in small sub-projects provides participants with a sense of ownership and purpose. Participants can become “expert reviewers” by classifying > 3 000 images within a project, providing acknowledgment of their efforts and additional motivation.\n\nClear impact goals: Communicating research questions, preliminary results, and conservation issues in an accessible and authentic manner ensures that participants understand the impact and importance of their contributions.\n\nTransparency: Maintaining transparency in project development and providing frequent updates through newsletters (~ twice a year) and email correspondence have been instrumental in building trust and maintaining participant interest.\n\nAppreciation and feedback: Showing appreciation for participant involvement through special acknowledgments, small gifts (e.g., a plaster cast of a jaguar track), and providing feedback on their contributions helps validate their efforts and encourages continued participation.\n\nCommunity and exchange: Hosting online events and regular online meetings between project management and participants promotes a sense of community, facilitates knowledge exchange, and provides opportunities for co-design. Additionally, WildLIVE! has been successfully integrated into school enrichment events covering a range of curriculum subjects such as geography, biology, and ecology.\n\nVisability, range, and outreach: WildLIVE! is hosted and promoted by Senckenberg – Leibniz Institution for Biodiversity and Earth System Research. The project also appears on two CS platforms, with the national platform BürgerSchaffenWissen attracting a large and growing user base. The project’s outreach, detailed in Figure 2, has positively impacted the attraction of new participants. In addition, a public and coached workspace in the “Aha?! Science Lab” hands-on exhibition at the Senckenberg Natural History Museum in Frankfurt, Germany, along with school events, continuously recruits new participants (Supplemental File 9: Figure 5).\n\nSustainability through institutional support and commitment: Embedded in Senckenberg’s broader CS initiative (“Gemeinsam forschen”), WildLIVE! along with various other CS projects benefit from coordinated support and a dedicated press office. The project is also showcased in the public museum (Supplemental File 9: Figure 5A), highlighting institutional commitment and support.\n\nThe effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the observed peaks in participant engagement, the positive feedback received, as well the relatively high engagement (e.g., the high image-per-labeler ratio) and time investment of the participants, indicating a successful implementation of engagement-enhancing practices in the WildLIVE! project. A wealth of studies suggest that employing methods similar to those previously described can cultivate emotional connections with participants, thereby substantially boosting engagement in CS initiatives (Baruch et al. 2016; Hsing et al. 2022; Hart et al. 2022).\n\nCitizen scientists explore “digital ecology”\n\nThe WildLIVE! project fosters collaboration between professional and citizen scientists in a digital space, driven by a shared interest in biodiversity and conservation. Citizen scientists enjoy the exposure to a diversity of exotic animals, and in particular the jaguar, a focal species of the project, which is not only of ecological importance but also boasts aesthetic charisma for people (Lorimer 2007), making the species particularly suitable for CS projects.\n\nThe CDF is a topographical space in which we conduct research on jaguars and other wildlife. However, WildLIVE! provides an additional layer as a topological space where characteristics of medialized human-animal encounters allow for further analysis of engagement (Pütz and Schlottmann 2020). In this context, the jaguar is not only significant as an important variable in the ecosystem, but also as an “object” that brings different working groups across differing professional backgrounds together in digital space for heterogeneous cooperation.\n\nWhile our initial results have a primary focus on jaguar biology and population dynamics (Jansen et al. 2020; Meißner et al. 2024), the jaguar may also be regarded as a flagship species that functions as a boundary object, “where each social world has partial jurisdiction over the resources represented by that object” (Star and Griesemer 1989, p. 412). This perspective opens the discussion towards more socio-ecological research, and takes into account the social dimensions of CS. It underlines the importance of integrating societal actors, such as landowners and farmers. Since our analysis shows the need to take measures to prevent the further deforestation of CDF, this issue remains open on a sociopolitical level.\n\nThe WildLIVE! project, while not directly connected to tangible biodiversity conservation efforts, plays an important role in promoting biodiversity conservation by raising awareness. For example, citizen scientists might reflect on their environmental impact and consumption habits. Additionally, it provides valuable insights for decision-makers like landowners and farmers by providing evidence of the extent and impacts of land use changes on wildlife. Participant involvement in WildLIVE! plays a critical role in connecting individuals from urban environments with wildlife in a real “hands-on” way. Thus, participant engagement in this project promotes a connectedness with nature and builds a sense of responsibility towards our natural heritage. And on the flip side, citizen scientists are playing a critical role in enabling research by aiding the processing of a large data set. We need the continued participation and engagement of citizen scientists for the sustainability of long-term biomonitoring that can be used to track the effects of land use change in the CDF and possibly other areas.\n\nConclusions and Outlook\n\nWe herein demonstrate that the CS project WildLIVE! makes significant contributions in three key areas: science, society, and nature conservation. More specifically, WildLIVE! provides a digital infrastructure that aids scientists in analyzing large datasets through CS engagement. This collaborative effort not only facilitates scientific research but also generates annotated training data sets valuable for machine learning. Moreover, WildLIVE! enables science communication, encourages citizen engagement, and facilitates learning about different species and their taxonomic classifications. Importantly, WildLIVE! contributes to an emerging form of wildlife experience in “digital ecologies” that plays a vital role in connecting people to biodiversity (Poerting and Rudolfi 2021). It raises awareness about biodiversity, environmental challenges, and the critical issue of biodiversity loss.\n\nThere is a growing need from science and conservation for the development of tools to deal with the “data deluge” generated by modern sensor devices, which rapidly produce vast amounts of data (Anderson 2008; Groom et al. 2022). Consequently, we see substantial demand for a platform that offers the integrated capabilities for data archiving, analysis, and CS engagement. Currently, in its prototype phase, we are developing the Wildlive Portal (Figure 5), accessible at http://wildlive.senckenberg.de. The Wildlive Portal enables sharing, discovering, and analyzing camera trap images, as well as supports crowdsourcing and machine-based curation and processing of biomonitoring data, in conformity with FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016). These principles provide guidelines to foster findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse of digital resources, thereby enabling efficient navigation and processing of resources by software agents or, in short, “machines” (Jacobsen et al. 2020, Wittenburg and Strawn 2021). To improve the FAIRability of data in the Wildlive Portal, primary data (digital images, audio, and video streams from the camera traps) are accompanied by comprehensive contextual metadata including details of the station setup, the context of data capturing, and the history of taxonomic assertions such as revisions. These data packages adhere to a platform-independent standard for the exchange of datasets designated as FAIR Digital Objects (Soiland-Reyes et al 2023).\n\nIn summary, by integrating machine observations with crowd-sourced and machine learning–based analysis within a single technical framework (Grieb et al. 2021), the portal will contribute to the development of a comprehensive and substantiated database. This portal will support the broader goal of biodiversity conservation by enabling more effective data management and post-processing, providing the foundation for informing evidence-based conservation strategies.",
      "# [Code Challenges at Labelbox. Share a Success Story?](https://www.finalroundai.com/interview-questions/ai_tutor_labelbox_coding_challenges)\nQuestion Explain\n\nThe interviewer is asking this question to gauge your practical experience in Machine Learning and problem-solving skills. You're required to discuss a complex problem you worked on that required the use of programming and data analysis skills (specifically in the Machine Learning domain). It's essentail here to show your approach towards resolving the issue, and how you used your knowledge of Machine Learning to do so. Key points to consider while answering this question include:\n\nDefine the complex problem distinctly.\n\nDescribe the approach or methodology you used to tackle the problem.\n\nExplain how your programming and data analysis skills were used.\n\nIllustrate the role of Machine Learning in resolving the issue.\n\nIndicate the outcome or results to highlight the success of your solution.\n\nAnswer Example 1\n\nAt my previous role in XYZ Corporation, there was a situation where the company wanted to predict the customer's churn rate. The major challenge was the dataset's imbalance as we had a very high client retention rate. So, the data corresponding to the churned customers was rare making the problem complex in Machine Learning aspects.\n\nI used Python programming for this project along with libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, seaborn/matplotlib for data visualization, and scikit-learn for implementing Machine Learning models. First, I cleaned and preprocessed the data which involved treating missing and outlier values. Once data was cleaned, I implemented SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) for handling the imbalance in the dataset.\n\nAfter preprocessing, I experimented with multiple machine learning algorithms. Finally, I chose Gradient Boosting Classifier due to its highest performance in cross-validation. Post that, the model was tuned for hyperparameters using GridSearch CV.\n\nUsing this strategy, the model predicted the potential customer churn trend with an accuracy of 86%. This indeed helped to drastically reduce the customer churn rate and hence was beneficial for the company.\n\nAnswer Example 2\n\nIn a non-profit organization where I worked earlier, we were tasked with analyzing a substantial amount of health data to predict the risk of disease outbreak in specific regions.\n\nHere, the complexity lay in the large, noisy, and unstructured health-related datasets that we needed to analyze. I applied my knowledge in programming using R, along with data analysis techniques to tackle the problem.\n\nFirst, I cleaned the data, processed it, and employed feature engineering to generate potential predictive features. I used ggplot2 in R for exploratory data analysis, which led to some interesting insights about the patterns and correlations.\n\nThe Machine Learning part was handled using the caret package in R. I utilized a random forest model, which is robust to outliers and irrelevant variables and performs well with complex datasets. I created training and validation sets, and tuning parameters to optimize the model's performance.\n\nFinally, the model was able to predict the disease outbreak risk in different areas with an accuracy of 88%. The organization was then able to focus its resources more effectively on high-risk areas, which optimized their work and impact.",
      "# [A globally sampled high-resolution hand-labeled validation dataset for evaluating surface water extent maps by Arellano-Thompson](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/16/4311/2024/)\nEffective monitoring of global water resources is increasingly critical due to climate change and population growth. Advancements in remote sensing technology, specifically in spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, are revolutionizing water resource monitoring, leading to more frequent and high-quality surface water extent maps using various techniques such as traditional image processing and machine learning algorithms. However, satellite imagery datasets contain trade-offs that result in inconsistencies in performance, such as disparities in measurement principles between optical (e.g., Sentinel-2) and radar (e.g., Sentinel-1) sensors and differences in spatial and spectral resolutions among optical sensors. Therefore, developing accurate and robust surface water mapping solutions requires independent validations from multiple datasets to identify potential biases within the imagery and algorithms. However, high-quality validation datasets are expensive to build, and few contain information on water resources. For this purpose, we introduce a globally sampled, high-spatial-resolution dataset labeled using 3 m PlanetScope imagery (Planet Team, 2017). Our surface water extent dataset comprises 100 images, each with a size of 1024×1024 pixels, which were sampled using a stratified random sampling strategy covering all 14 biomes. We highlighted urban and rural regions, lakes, and rivers, including braided rivers and coastal regions. We evaluated two surface water extent mapping methods using our dataset – Dynamic World (Brown et al., 2022), based on Sentinel-2, and the NASA IMPACT model (Paul and Ganju, 2021), based on Sentinel-1. Dynamic World achieved a mean intersection over union (IoU) of 72.16 % and F1 score of 79.70 %, while the NASA IMPACT model had a mean IoU of 57.61 % and F1 score of 65.79 %. Performance varied substantially across biomes, highlighting the importance of evaluating models on diverse landscapes to assess their generalizability and robustness. Our dataset can be used to analyze satellite products and methods, providing insights into their advantages and drawbacks. Our dataset offers a unique tool for analyzing satellite products, aiding the development of more accurate and robust surface water monitoring solutions. The dataset can be accessed via https://doi.org/10.25739/03nt-4f29 (Mukherjee et al., 2024).\n\nMapping surface water is becoming increasingly important due to the impacts of climate change, as many regions face the prospect of droughts (Dai, 2013) and floods (Tellman et al., 2021). Timely, accurate, and reliable monitoring of surface water extent is critical for better management, conservation, and risk-reduction practices, but this remains a growing challenge for researchers. Remotely sensed satellite data have provided a unique vantage point for measuring surface water extent (Bijeesh and Narasimhamurthy, 2020; Mueller et al., 2016) using different measurement principles such as optical and radar sensors (Markert et al., 2018). Recent advances in satellite sensors have increased spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, leading to significant growth in methods for monitoring surface water using multiple satellite products (Pekel et al., 2016; Martinis et al., 2022; Giezendanner et al., 2023). Among these methods, machine learning and deep learning algorithms gained popularity due to their ability to leverage large volumes of satellite data (both public and commercial) to accurately map the Earth's surface (Isikdogan et al., 2017; Wieland et al., 2023).\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of satellite water products based on different sensors is not consistent across all conditions, as each product involves trade-offs between spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions (Wulder et al., 2015). Higher-spatial-resolution products like PlanetScope (PS) often produce more accurate maps than lower-resolution Sentinel-2 (10 m) or Landsat 8 (30 m) data (Acharki, 2022). Moreover, radar and optical sensors measure surface water properties differently, leading to variations in accuracy and suitability (Martinis et al., 2022), even at similar spatial resolutions. The study by Ghayour et al. (2021) compared Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 and found performance varied across methods. As Wolpert (2002) asserted, no single algorithm is expected to perform optimally in every situation. The study by Li et al. (2022) summarizes the current common methods of water extraction based on optical and radar images.\n\nIndependently evaluating satellite products and methods using independent validation datasets is crucial for increasing trust in the results (Bamber and Bindschadler, 1997). However, such datasets are resource-intensive to create, and existing ones may not be suitable for all needs. For example, BigEarthNet (Sumbul et al., 2019) contains around 600 000 multi-labeled Sentinel-2 image patches, of which 83 000 contain water bodies. This dataset confirms the presence of water within a patch but does not delineate it at the pixel level. The Chesapeake Conservancy land cover dataset (Chesapeake Bay Program, 2023) provides high-resolution (1 m) per-pixel water labels for the Chesapeake Bay watershed regional area. LandCoverNet (Alemohammad and Booth, 2020) contains global 10 m resolution data from Sentinel-2 with a water class. Flood mapping has also been a strong research focus, with datasets like the Sentinel-1-based NASA flood detection (Gahlot et al., 2021), Sen1Floods11 (Bonafilia et al., 2020), Sen12-Flood (Rambour et al., 2020), and C2S-MS Floods (Cloud to Street et al., 2022) that use both optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) imagery. While suitable for validating surface water maps, some of these datasets rely on 10 m resolution public satellite imagery or lack global coverage at high resolution. The ephemeral nature of floods also requires specialized detection models even though floodwater is technically surface water (Bonafilia et al., 2020). Wieland et al. (2023) developed a semiautomated global binary surface water reference dataset with 15 000 tiles (256×256 pixels) sampled from high-resolution (≤1 m) imagery. However, this dataset uses weak labels generated by a model rather than manual labeling, making it less suitable for validation.\n\nTo thoroughly evaluate a product's effectiveness and robustness, multiple independent assessments are needed since high accuracy on one dataset does not guarantee similar performance on others. No single dataset can fully represent the real world (Paullada et al., 2021), and manual labels inevitably contain some subjectivity (Misra et al., 2016). Independent evaluations also help mitigate the issue of data leakage, where the validation set is improperly used during model training, leading to overfitting (Vandewiele et al., 2021). Multiple independent validation datasets are therefore essential for comprehensively evaluating and building trust in remote sensing-based surface water products and methods.\n\nIn this study, we present a high-quality, globally sampled, high-resolution surface water dataset consisting of 100 hand-labeled 1024×1024 pixel PlanetScope images at 3 m resolution. Our work builds upon existing satellite-based datasets for validating surface water extent. The motivation is to provide a higher-resolution hand-labeled dataset for evaluating surface water products derived from medium-resolution public satellites like Landsat and Sentinel and commercial higher-resolution PlanetScope imagery. Our dataset addresses some of the limitations of existing datasets by providing pixel-level water labels at a higher resolution (3 m) compared to some other datasets and encompassing diverse biomes and contexts (urban/rural, mountains/plains, rivers/lakes) for comprehensive evaluations. We evaluate two state-of-the-art surface water extent mapping methods using our dataset: the Dynamic World land use and land cover product based on optical Sentinel-2 imagery and the NASA IMPACT inundation mapping model based on radar Sentinel-1 data, which was the winning solution in a recent flood detection challenge. By applying our validation dataset to these products and methods, we aim to better understand their advantages and limitations. We anticipate our dataset will contribute to improved accuracy assessment, spatial generalizability analysis, and robustness evaluation of existing surface water products and methods. These advancements can ultimately benefit societies by promoting more effective monitoring and management of water resources, especially in the face of climate change and population growth.\n\n2.1 Sampling\n\nOur objective was to build a dataset that closely represents the true distribution of surface water features using only 100 samples. A representative dataset enables testing the spatial generalizability and accuracy of surface water extent products. However, achieving a true representation is nearly impossible (Paullada et al., 2021). We approached this challenge by sampling from different biomes, as defined by Olson et al. (2001), which encompass various climates and land conditions, giving a better chance of providing high variance within samples.\n\nWe employed a stratified random sampling strategy to ensure the representativeness of our dataset. First, we created a 2 km buffer around global river and lake shapefiles provided by the World Wildlife Fund (2005) using QGIS (Quantum GIS). We then clipped these buffers with the shapefiles of each of the 14 biomes. Within each biome, we randomly placed 50 points using QGIS's random point generator and selected at least 5 of them as samples.\n\nTo address the various contexts in which surface water exists, we randomly selected additional samples from urbanized regions (Patterson and Kelso, 2012), braided rivers, and coastal regions. Urban areas are spatially heterogeneous, often resulting in increased complexity for water detection. We also separately sampled from lakes and rivers to ensure a balanced representation of both water body types. Braided rivers and coastal areas were included.\n\nFigure 1 shows the number of samples for each biome, while Fig. 2 illustrates the global spatial distribution of the samples. The numbers of samples from “Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests” and “Tropical and Subtropical Coniferous Forests” were limited due to their smaller areal coverage. Approximately two-thirds of our labels are from rivers and the remaining one-third are from lakes. We sampled a larger portion from “Deserts and Xeric Shrublands” (16 samples) because water extraction methods generally perform worse in these regions, especially when using radar imagery (Martinis, 2017).\n\nThe temporal distribution of our samples spans from 2021 to 2023, covering different seasons to capture seasonal variations in surface water extent. While our sampling strategy aimed to maximize representativeness within the constraints of labeling resources, we acknowledge that the limited number of samples (100) may not fully capture all global surface water variations.\n\nDuring the sampling process, we implemented quality control measures to ensure that the selected locations were suitable for labeling and analysis. We downloaded the PlanetScope scene for each location, divided the scene into 1024×1024 sized images, and then selected the image that contained sufficient water and no cloud cover.\n\n2.2 Data processing\n\nAfter selecting 100 locations based on our sampling strategy, we downloaded 8-band, 3 m resolution SuperDove PlanetScope (PS) imagery from 2021 to 2023 using our access to the NASA Commercial SmallSat Data Acquisition (CSDA) program. As our objective was to evaluate most medium-resolution satellite sensors, including Sentinel-1 (S1), we ensured that the failure of the Sentinel-1B satellite, on 23 December 2021, did not create a large temporal gap between the label and the last available scene from the satellite. For locations only covered by Sentinel-1B and not Sentinel-1A, we acquired PS scenes before the Sentinel-1B failure date.\n\nDuring the scene selection process, we excluded areas with perennially frozen water. If a location contained seasonal ice, we replaced that PS image with a summer image when the water was not frozen. This approach ensured that our dataset focused on liquid water surfaces, which are more relevant for surface water extent mapping.\n\nFrom each larger PS scene, we extracted a 1024×1024 pixel image, covering an area of approximately 9.4 km2. We chose 1024×1024 pixel images to ensure sufficient pixels and spatial context for comparison with medium-resolution imagery (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel). For instance, a 30 m Landsat image corresponding to our labels would have around 100×100 pixels, while a 10 m Sentinel image would have approximately 376×376 pixels. Figure 3 showcases two examples of the PS images selected for labeling, displayed in false-color composite (near-infrared, red, and green bands).\n\n2.3 Data labeling\n\nWe used high-resolution 3 m PlanetScope (PS) data for labeling, ideal for the evaluation of lower-resolution satellite products such as Sentinel-1 (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2) at 10 m, or Landsat sensors at 30 m.\n\nThe labeling was performed by experienced analysts to distinguish between three classes: water, low-confidence water, and non-water. The water class represents areas with a clear presence of water, while the low-confidence water class marks pixels where the presence of water is uncertain but probable. The non-water class encompasses all other land cover types. To assist the labelers, we provided true-color composite (TCC) and false-color composite (FCC) images using the near-infrared, red, and green bands for each sample.\n\nIn cases where the presence of water was unclear in the PS imagery, we cross-referenced them with higher-resolution basemaps from Bing and Google. Unresolved features were assigned to the low-confidence water category, ensuring that the water class only includes pixels with a high degree of certainty. During the evaluation process, the low-confidence water class can be excluded or added to the water category as necessary.\n\nTo streamline the labeling process and ensure the creation of high-quality labels, we utilized the Labelbox platform (Labelbox, 2024), which provides efficient tools for data annotation. After the initial labeling, we performed several rounds of quality checks on each label to maintain accuracy and consistency across the dataset.\n\nIn total, we labeled 100 images, each with a size of 1024×1024 pixels, covering a total surface area of 940 km2. The labeling process, including quality control, took approximately 2 h per image, resulting in a total of 200 h of work. The labeled surface water accounts for nearly 250 km2 of the total area. Each label is assigned a unique sample ID (SID) ranging from 1 to 100 and includes the date (YYYYMMDD) of the PS image used for labeling.\n\n2.4 Dataset analysis\n\nWe labeled a total of one-hundred 1024×1024 PS images at 3 m, with the overall class distribution covering 24.9 % of the total surface area, low-confidence water covering 1.2 %, and the rest (73.9 %) being non-water (Fig. 5). The distribution of water pixel percentages for each individual label, as displayed in Fig. 6, demonstrates that most labels contain less than 50 % water pixels by design, with the mean water surface area per label being 26.10 km2. This focus on having more non-water area enables better delineation of water boundaries, as the water class itself tends to be more homogeneous and therefore less complex from both labeling and mapping perspectives.\n\nAs mentioned previously, our labeled dataset covers water surface areas across different biomes (Table 1). The mean percentage of water content per label varies substantially between biomes, from a low of 5.29 % for “Mediterranean Forests, Woodlands and Scrub” to a high of 42.95 % for “Temperate Grasslands, Savannas and Shrublands”. This demonstrates the diversity of landscapes and water coverage captured in our dataset. In total, our dataset provides 2609.78 km2 of labeled water surface area, covering a variety of landscapes such as rivers passing through urban regions, braided rivers in deltas, rivers passing through forests and agricultural fields, and waterbodies in plain and mountainous regions. The diversity and representativeness of our dataset make it a valuable resource for testing the limits and robustness of satellite data products and mapping methods.\n\n2.5 Dataset structure\n\nAll 100 labels are in the GeoTIFF format with the UInt8 data type and a single band. Each pixel can contain four possible values: 0 (no data), 1 (non-water), 2 (low-confidence water), and 3 (water). The labels are in the WGS84 (EPSG:4326) coordinate reference system. Each label has a corresponding PlanetScope image used for labeling in Labelbox. The PlanetScope images are also in the WGS84 (EPSG:4326) coordinate reference system and contain three spectral bands (red, green, and blue) in true-color composite. Based on our PS image release agreement with Planet, we converted the original surface reflectance values to byte format with possible pixel values between 0 and 255, instead of UInt16.\n\nThe label files are named using the following convention: SIDX_YYYYMMDD.tif, where “SIDX” is the unique sample ID (with X ranging from 1 to 100) and “YYYYMMDD” represents the date of the PlanetScope image used for labeling. The corresponding PlanetScope images follow the naming convention: SIDX_PSID.tif, where SIDX is the same as the label, but PSID is the original SuperDove PlanetScope image ID, allowing for the retrieval of the original surface reflectance values, provided there is access.\n\nOur dataset is organized using the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) format, which is a standardized way to describe and catalog geospatial data. The STAC format provides a clear and consistent structure for storing and accessing the labels and their corresponding PlanetScope images, along with relevant metadata.\n\nWe evaluated two surface water mapping methods based on an optical and a radar satellite imagery product to demonstrate the use of our validation dataset. We used standard metrics for classification – precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, intersection over union (IoU), and accuracy for evaluating the two surface water maps. We measured their performance across each biome and their overall performance.\n\n3.1 Performance of Sentinel-2-based Dynamic World on detecting surface water\n\nDynamic World (DW) is a land use land cover product from Google that utilizes a deep learning model trained on their own labeled dataset. The product includes nine classes, including water, and produces a map for every Sentinel-2 image. Each Sentinel-2 image is post-processed and with clouds removed. We downloaded Sentinel-2 images within 3 d of each of the 100 labeled PlanetScope images. We also applied a not-a-number (NaN) filter, ensuring that images with at least 90 % valid pixels are considered. After applying the temporal and NaN filters, there were 53 corresponding Sentinel-2-based DW maps out of our 100 labels. From each DW map, we extracted the first band, which contains the water class. Each DW class contains continuous values between 0 and 1, where 1 denotes the highest confidence in the model prediction. We converted the continuous values to binary, thresholding at 0.3. The water class is one of the least confused classes in the DW product, so mixed pixels are less likely. Finally, we evaluated DW on our labels. Note that for evaluation we converted the low-confidence water class to water. We finally resampled the DW water class to match the resolution of the labels at 3 m using nearest-neighbor interpolation before evaluating. Note that for evaluation we merged the low-confidence water class with water. Therefore, labels were either 0 (non-water) or 1 (water).\n\nFigure 7 illustrates the performance of the water class in the Dynamic World product across different biomes using IoU. IoU provides an assessment of the overlap between the predicted and ground truth water pixels, with higher values indicating better performance. The number of samples per biome varies, with some biomes having more representative data than others. For biomes with a larger number of samples, such as “Deserts and Xeric Shrublands” and “Boreal Forests and Taiga”, the IoU scores provide a more robust evaluation of the DW water class performance. Despite the variations in sample size, notable differences in performance can be observed among the biomes. It is important to note that the IoU metric is influenced by the amount of water present in each label. Higher water percentage often leads to higher IoU. However, our dataset has an average of 26.1 % surface water pixels, providing a balanced assessment of the DW water class performance.\n\nFigure 8 provides a visual comparison of the Dynamic World water class predictions with the labels for two locations: Sundarban National Park, Bangladesh (SID01), and Shandong, China (SID13). The DW product appears to capture the majority of the water pixels accurately; however, it misses the narrow rivers (SID01) and it incorrectly ignores two bridges (SID13).\n\nTable 2 summarizes the performance metrics for the Dynamic World water class evaluated on our hand-labeled dataset. The mean precision of 0.8812 indicates that, on average, 88.12 % of the pixels predicted as water by DW are actually water in our ground truth labels. The mean sensitivity (recall) of 0.7745 suggests that DW correctly identifies 77.45 % of the water pixels in our labels. The high mean specificity (0.9656) indicates that DW accurately classifies non-water pixels, with minimal misclassification as water. The F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, has a mean value of 0.7970, indicating a good balance between the two metrics. The mean IoU of 0.7216 signifies that, on average, there is a 72.16 % overlap between the predicted and ground truth water pixels. Lastly, the mean accuracy of 0.9529 shows that DW correctly classifies 95.29 % of the pixels overall, including non-water pixels. However, the high standard deviation indicates that there is a large variability in performance for almost all metrics except specificity and accuracy, since they take into account the non-water pixels.\n\n3.2 Performance of the Sentinel-1-based deep learning model\n\nWe evaluated the performance of a deep learning model (Paul and Ganju, 2021) for inundation mapping that uses S1 radar imagery. This deep learning model was the competition winner at the NASA IMPACT challenge for flood detection. Unlike Dynamic World, which contained a surface water class, this method focuses on flood or more specifically inundation class. Technically, our hand-labeled dataset also labels inundation, although our labels did not focus on capturing flooding. Therefore, we are not directly comparing the S1 IMPACT flood model against the Dynamic World water class.\n\nWe processed radiometrically corrected S1 imagery from Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF)'s data repository using the Hyp3 API (application programming interface). S1 imagery was searched for each label 3 d before and after the labeled date. We clipped the S1 scenes based on the labels, and then we applied the trained model to these clipped S1 scenes using the trained model. We then evaluated the predictions from the deep learning model on our labels after resampling the imagery to match the resolution of the higher-resolution labels using nearest-neighbor interpolation. Thus, 72 S1 images were selected for this evaluation. Note that for evaluation we converted the low-confidence water class to water. Therefore, labels were either 0 (non-water) or 1 (water).\n\nFigure 9 illustrates the performance of the S1-based deep learning model across different biomes using the intersection over union (IoU) metric. Performance across biomes has a large variation, with some notable differences. For example, the IMPACT model performed robustly on “Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests”, “Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests”, “Tundra”, and “Mangroves”. Although for “Tropical and Subtropical Coniferous Forests”, “Temperate Coniferous Forests”, and “Deserts and Xeric Shrublands”, the model performed less accurately and with large variations; this was especially true for “Mediterranean Forests, Woodlands and Scrub” where the model consistently performed poorly. The effectiveness is influenced by the fact that the training dataset of this model is focused on only five flood events globally. Therefore, performing accurately on the global surface water dataset is not the objective of this model. Nonetheless, the objective is still detection inundation, and the variation in performance provides clues to how such a model can be improved by sampling from biomes or other contexts (urban, river, lake, etc.).\n\nFigure 10 provides a visual comparison of the Sentinel-1-based deep learning model's predictions with the ground truth labels for two locations: Nam Định, Vietnam (SID33), and Paymaster Landing, California, USA (SID59). The model appears to capture the majority of the water pixels accurately. However, the labels and the corresponding prediction by the S1-based model demonstrates the complexity of labeling and identifying water in a meandering braided river (SID33). In the case of SID59, the S1 model performs well, except for the coarser edges of a river in a more arid landscape.\n\nTable 3 summarizes the performance metrics for the S1-based deep learning model evaluated on our hand-labeled dataset. The metrics exhibit significant variability across the evaluated labels. The S1 IMPACT model generally found it difficult to predict water pixels across several biomes. Apart from the differences in resolution, turbulent water and water located in spatially heterogeneous landscapes are more complicated to detect. Given the cloud-free observations, S1-based models can be of considerable benefit for regular monitoring and consistent observations.\n\nAlthough our hand-labeled dataset provides a valuable resource for evaluating surface water extent products, it has several limitations that must be considered. First, the spatial resolution of the dataset is limited to 3 m, making it more suitable for evaluating lower-spatial-resolution imagery (> 3 m). For higher resolutions (≤3 m), the influence of human labeling errors on the evaluation results is likely to increase. Despite our efforts to cross-reference multiple sources of higher resolution (<1 m Bing and Google basemaps) during our labeling process and implement considerable quality control, the dataset unavoidably contains biases from our labelers, in addition to the biases in the optical PS imagery itself. A model using PS will likely perform the best since PS was the primary source for labeling. Moreover, some features remained unresolved, especially features finer than 3 m, leading to the addition of another class called “low-confidence water”.\n\nWhile we made an effort to include samples from diverse contexts in which water can be found (urban, lakes, braided rivers, mountainous regions) and multiple biomes covering different seasons, designing a truly representative dataset is not feasible. The stratified random sampling strategy used to create the dataset aims to cover diverse contexts and biomes but may not capture all the variability in surface water appearance across different regions and seasons. Additionally, the dataset only represents a snapshot in time and does not account for temporal changes in surface water extent, which can be significant in some regions due to seasonal variations, human interventions, or flooding. For example, this dataset does not include frozen water bodies.\n\nTherefore, we recommend using evaluations from multiple independent datasets from various sources to achieve further robustness in evaluation. While our dataset is primarily designed for validation purposes, it can still be used for fine-tuning pretrained models. However, it does not include the original input PlanetScope images of our labels, which are required for training models. This ensures that there is no data leak from the training process, maintaining the integrity of the evaluation process. Nevertheless, relying on a single dataset for evaluation has its limitations, and using multiple independent datasets is crucial for assessing the robustness and generalizability of surface water mapping methods.\n\nAcharki, S.: PlanetScope contributions compared to Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 for LULC mapping, Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment, 27, 100774, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2022.100774, 2022. a\n\nAlemohammad, H. and Booth, K.: LandCoverNet: A global benchmark land cover classification training dataset, arXiv [preprint], arXiv:2012.03111, 2020. a\n\nBamber, J. and Bindschadler, R.: An improved elevation dataset for climate and ice-sheet modelling: validation with satellite imagery, Ann.
