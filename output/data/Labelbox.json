Nowadays, pixel accurate labeling has become the new norm as it removes most of the noise that bounding boxes introduce in the data. Because annotating an image at pixel level is more time consuming than drawing a bounding box it can cost up to 10x more! That is why image annotation tool was made to reduce annotation time and cost.",

The projects will require labeling many data with various object tags. Using an open-source tool is an option but will require an engineering effort as I will look for the following features (Mentioned in the next paragraph) to add in the future.   \n\n\nHowever, I am also looking at tools (paid versions such as label box, roboflow, superannotate, etc) that can make the labeling effort faster from day one. The tool needs to have the following features:  \n\n\n* Easy to visualize data and annotations\n* Data embedding \n* Custom labeling and review workflows \n* Model-assisted labeling  and auto-labeling tool  \n\n\nI would appreciate it if I could get some feedback from the broader computer vision community about their experiences of using the paid version tool.   \n\n\nWhat was the tool that you used for your project and why?   \n\n\nIf the opportunity is provided again, would you pick up the same tool?

And it has this “attribute” function” where you can define, add more information, classify the objects. But I can not edit the added annotation objects.\n\n    Labelbox \n\nLike dLabel, you can create annotation objects whenever you want. However, it is less convenient than dLabel as you need to go to the editor’s page and edit or add more annotation objects. There is “classification” function where you can classify the objects. I personally like the “attribute “ feature from dLabel more and it can contain more information about the objects.\n\n    Spervisely  \n\nAdding and modifying the annotation objects are easy and clear. There is no feature like or similar to “attribute” from dLabel or “classification” form Labelbox. One good part is that I can personalize my own hotkeys for each object, which can adapt an individual's annotation habit.\n\n**3 Annotation speed for 30 frames.**\n\nThe data set is 30images. Using bonding boxes. 2 annotation objects (hand and drink)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||uploading data time|annotation time|clicks per frame|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|dLabel|1 min|9 min|7 clicks|\n|Labelbox|1 min|11 min 10 sec|7 clicks|\n|Supervisly|2 min|11 min 30 sec|9 clicks|\n\n**4 layout of the annotation page**\n\n    dLabel  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/63kfjmluitv51.png?width=1367&format=png&auto=webp&s=d40dfe571254ff2aa118b03bb6873eabde286c72\n\nYou have the features at the left, the statues in the right and the image in the centre.\n\nOne the left side, there is one “group” feature which I found is very useful. It adds interaction between objects. Like you set the “tomato” and the “hand” into one group which indicates they have interactions. The hand is picking the tomato.\n\nThere is a history column on the right where you can also trace the annotation history on the right.\n\nOn the bottom of the centre, there’s one QA bar which can come in hand when doing quality control.\n\n    Labelbox\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fkpotowvitv51.png?width=1374&format=png&auto=webp&s=13d08cf8b70f37e80c7ff061d3295578579f124f\n\nI personally find the layout too simple.

You send data via an API call, their system makes a guess, and a human will give the final check. So essentially, semi-supervised learning as a service (SLaaS, you're welcome). It's being used by huge companies like OpenAI, Baidu, AirBnB.\n\nI guess my question is.. why is it so valuable? They have clearly simplified the workflow for gathering training data through their platform and human outsourcing. But what makes their method special? Why can't another company replicate it- it seems like a project magnitudes cheaper than $1 billion.\n\nIs the initial estimation algorithm proprietary and does it hold a lot of their value? Is the efficiency and accuracy of their human-labelling side unmatched?\n\nNote: these are genuine questions and should not be read as if they're rhetorical.\n\n## Comment ID focowkl with +21 score by [(igorsusmelj, Reddit, 2020-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/g6r0yv/d_scale_ai_what_separates_them_and_why_are_they/focowkl/) (in reply to ID g6r0yv):\nScale is not the only company doing annotation.

They started with simple outsourcing tasks.\n\nThere is now a new wave of startups trying to improve the workflow and tools of such outsourcing tasks using ML. At the same time they each try to build a platform out of it.

Sure, there are many \"if\"s involved, but imho there is a chance a large portion of low-sophistication, off-the-shelve \"data science\" work (collect some data in a pandas dataframe, run some default scikit learn models to make predictions, make some shiny visualizations) will eventually include fine-tuning sota models in a supervised fashion to include knowledge extracted from text (and images?). Thus compared to today, there would be far more companies requireing labeing data.\n\nIf something like this happens, my (sad) experience is that if there is some company offering labeling as a service that lists a few major players as its customers, that can be enough to make execs prefer them. **If** something like this happens, I think Scale AIs headstart and marketing may actually be enough to make them really profitable regardless of if competitors are offer similar or even slightly better services.\n\nApart from that, obviously I would not rule out hype and overvaluation as mentioned in other comments.\n\n### Comment ID fofaf5i with +3 score by [(catandDuck, Reddit, 2020-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/g6r0yv/d_scale_ai_what_separates_them_and_why_are_they/fofaf5i/) (in reply to ID foexn8o):\nThis is an interesting perspective and it makes sense generally.

I had a really hard time using Mechanical Turk for specialized tasks (schematics), and it was really hard to manage quality. If you need classification or object detection it should do the job. If you aren't interested I'm always open to feedback so I can improve the product.\n\nAnd out of fairness, since I've done the market research, here are a few of the open source tools. I'm not sure which support accounts but you could definitely self host one. A few of these have commercial offerings too worth checking out.\n\n* [Label Studio](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio)\n* [CVAT](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat)\n* [VoTT](https://github.com/microsoft/VoTT)\n* [YOLO Mark](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark)\n\nAnd here are the paid tools with a rough pricing per month. They almost all have free tiers with some limit on the number of annotations or images. The reason many of them are expensive is because they include some auto annotate features. Hasty looks like the most straightforward pricing model for just annotating.\n\n* [Hasty](https://hasty.ai/pricing) - 37 gb-mo free, $0.8 euro per gb-mo $300 min  \n* [Scale](https://scale.com/studio) - 1000 annotations free, 50k annotations $167 / mo \n* [V7](https://www.v7labs.com/pricing) - 50k files + open source free, private + 250k files $416/mo  \n* [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/pricing) - 10k images free, 10k+ $1k / mo \n* [Superb](https://www.superb-ai.com/pricing) - 20k images free, paid unknown  \n* [LabelBox](https://labelbox.com/pricing) - 10k annotations free, paid unknown\n* [Snorkel](https://snorkel.ai/snorkel-flow-platform/label/) - Not listed (if anyone knows, please comment!)\n\nIf MekaBytes looks like it suits your needs I would love to host the dataset as long it isn't porn (Stripe doesn't like porn).\n\nFor hiring people, make sure you incorporate and handle all the tax forms for contractors.

SaaS tools are for the most part generic, to the point of being useless.\n\nIf you team has even one good developer and the time then fork an open source app (any one of them) and design one according to your exact spec so you don't have to migrate out of the tool when you go ever so slightly off script and want to tag extra things or in a non standard format.\n\n### Comment ID ig95gzi with +2 score by [(cygn, Reddit, 2022-07-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vze1hj/d_what_are_people_using_to_organize_large_groups/ig95gzi/) (in reply to ID ig8ni9t):\nAgree!

The source code is trivial, and you can make some adjustments (line colours, box fill, etc.) before putting it into use with people. \n\nThe downside is that the easiest way is to launch it from the terminal, which scares some people who label the data. However, for us, this has not been an issue.

I never threatened anyone. They also went after me for starting my own business when manic. This is common when I have manic episodes and the. i abandon them once I'm back at work.

Don't get me wrong, Manu is a good dude but he's gotta get out of of the way sometimes. Revenue is surprisingly low considering the valuation. I suspect Labelbox will remain a medium-sized business for a while rather than live up to the rapid growth trajectory we expect many startups to follow in Silicon Valley.

          "pros": "I have been working as an engineer for a while now. It's also my first time experiencing hyper-growth. I get to build tools that are enabling fascinating AI uses cases across so many industries. \n\nFirst of all, I couldn't be more excited about working with the new head of engineering. The current engineering leader is highly technical and comes from Autodesk. Autodesk has many similarities to Labelbox as both companies build highly complex software systems (graphics &amp; backend). I am more optimistic and enthusiastic about working on products than ever before. It's a night and day difference compared to the previous leadership in the product and engineering. The former engineering leader wasn't decisive and didn't act fast or did much. For example, our CI/CD has been sub-par for a long time. The new engineering leader quickly identified this and is leading the change. When the CEO let go of the former director of product and VPE, I wasn't sure about the decision. But now, after seeing the new state, it all makes sense. We are shipping new innovative products and features faster than ever. Our new product managers &amp; engineers are passionate, technical, and take ownership. It just feels like more things are getting done. \n\nI've liked that the company has embraced the remote first strategy. I moved out of the bay area and have been able to work from different places and be more productive. \n\nFinally, I very much enjoy building things here. It's the first company I have worked for where the company values are used to make decisions daily. For example, people high-five each other during allhands or in slack about something great someone did and exemplified the company values.",

          "pros": "Before this job, I worked at one of the Big 4 in consulting. I had been developing a tech background in consulting for around a year and a half before joining Labelbox. \n\nI couldn't be happier with my life now. I'll break this down a bit:\n\n- The Industry:\nLabelbox works with cutting-edge AI in every industry, and it's pretty badass. As an AI nerd myself, I get to see how companies are using AI and how Labelbox helps them do that. \n\n- The Leadership:\nI get encouraged by leadership to lean into my intellectual curiosity however it manifests. Leadership constantly checks in to make sure I'm able to manage my daily responsibilities, job goals, and my own greater career goals. I truly feel heard, and this level of attention is something I've never experienced working at a Big 4.\n\n- The People:\nThe work culture is fantastic, and everyone is really exciting and friendly. Since everyone is remote, they have automated systems that make sure you stay connected - not in a \"stay connected and talk about work\" kind of way, but in more of a \"put your work down for a little bit and connect with another person\" kind of way. It's really nice; I've worked here 100% remotely and when I met everyone in person the first time they truly did feel like friends. We all had a big barbecue, and even had private DJ-hosted party at an art gallery venue after! That is a testament to the culture here. \n\nThe Work-Life Balance:\nI have a near-perfect work-life balance due to the company culture. I've been told \"why are you still online, go enjoy your evening\" at 5:30PM PLENTY of times. This job and the people truly respect your time. \n\nVacation Days:\nAlso, there's unlimited PTO - and they mean it. Team members are happy to cover for each other, and there's a lot of intended protocols to make sure that PTO is seamless. There's never any guilt in taking PTO here, which is something I admittedly did feel working at a Big 4 consulting firm. \n\nWorking Remotely:\nThe job is 100% remote, but they do have an office in SF. Truly, you are free to do whichever you want and there's no pressure in either direction. My boss moved to Hawaii...just because. As long as you can do your job, Labelbox is happy so long as you are!",

There are also sponsored daily lunch for all employees.\n\nWhile interviewing, one of my concerns was reading Glassdoor about a very hands-on CEO. That was the exact situation I dealt with at my last company that led an extremely poor work-life balance and eventually was the cause of my departure there. However, I have experienced Manu (the Labelbox CEO) to be a great communicator and collaborator thus far. The work-life balance has been very enjoyable and the entire team is friendly. So that's why I wanted to share my experience here - most of the negative reviews I read seem to be pretty outdated or from disgruntled ex-employees.",

The move to remote work was smooth as everyone rolled up their sleeves to innovate how we work together to continue growing as a business and continue growing as a team.\r\n\r\nFor example regarding the culture, before covid there were monthly team events and since then we started these awesome zoom events such as yoga sessions, guided meditations, and other cool activities that keep us bonded as a team. \r\n\r\nThe founders are very smart and laser-focused, and no matter what issues arise, everyone is eager to contribute so each of us succeeds individually and as a group. \r\n\r\nRegarding career growth, Labelbox is growing so fast so there is a very high ceiling for individual growth.",

Some much anticipated features are finally shipping and may unleash new growth \r\n-Surprisingly great logo wins in the Fortune 500. Very impressive for a company just 3 years old. \r\n-Young-ish founding team has less patience for inefficiency and embraces productivity tools like ProductBoard, Slack, Asana, etc... \r\n-The people at Labelbox are all quite nice\r\n-Surprisingly diverse leaders throughout the org. We have women running customer success, women in key roles in our legal, marketing, and more.\r\n-Surprisingly well run remote onboarding program, and great remote work setup \r\n-Comp is quite good, and the company lets you expense $20 lunch during the pandemic. \r\n\r\nI've been through my share of weird team shifts and crushing workloads at Labelbox, but that's the startup life. If I wanted a chill but boring life I would just go over to an established company. I think some of the negative reviews in Glassdoor have some merit but life here isn't as bad as they make it out to be. I've been at a toxic company before and this one is far from it. The people are actually quite well intentioned, and maybe there is some immature leadership but it's not all that bad. \r\n\r\nI think a lot of Labelbox's sad days are behind it. We've gotten past a lot of tough moments where the product was buggy, customers were ticked off, COVID pandemic was crushing everyone, etc.... Now there's light at the end of the tunnel. Things are getting better by the week.",

As long as I go to the meetings I am supposed to, I feel completely free to get my work done at the times that are the most convenient for me.\n• Great remote culture. I feel like I know more coworkers better than at my last in office job because of the ways the help us stay engaged remotely.\n• Competitive compensation packages\n• I truly feel a connection to the company mission and feel like I am making an impact.

On the other hand, if you are close to them they will go to great lengths to protect you, even if you are a manager and have committed harassment against a subordinate. It is unclear if they even understand what software engineering entails, and the have no concept of how to manage a SaaS product. Manu is completely detached from the realities of engineering, and sees Peter Thiel as a role model. He surrounds himself with yes men and uses others as his attack dog. Executives will not accept that they are often wrong and make incomprehensible decisions daily. They frequently contradicts themselves in meetings, and lack the soft skills required to manage.",

The fancier the title, the more incompetent the person. Every 'director of something' holds their position simply because they blindly agree with whatever the CEO decides. \n\nMany teams in this company operate in silos with virtually no oversight, freely building whatever they want. \n\nThey often lie to customers, and the Alignerr product is probably the most alarming example. The manager/director in charge has no scruples—this person is willing to say or do anything to win customer contracts. It’s genuinely disturbing. \n\nIf you like to witness chaos, people without any morals, join this company is quite amazing to see.",

If I wanted a chill but boring life I would just go over to an established company. I think some of the negative reviews in Glassdoor have some merit but life here isn't as bad as they make it out to be. I've been at a toxic company before and this one is far from it. The people are actually quite well intentioned, and maybe there is some immature leadership but it's not all that bad. \r\n\r\nI think a lot of Labelbox's sad days are behind it.

The current engineering leader is highly technical and comes from Autodesk. Autodesk has many similarities to Labelbox as both companies build highly complex software systems (graphics &amp; backend). I am more optimistic and enthusiastic about working on products than ever before. It's a night and day difference compared to the previous leadership in the product and engineering. The former engineering leader wasn't decisive and didn't act fast or did much. For example, our CI/CD has been sub-par for a long time. The new engineering leader quickly identified this and is leading the change. When the CEO let go of the former director of product and VPE, I wasn't sure about the decision. But now, after seeing the new state, it all makes sense. We are shipping new innovative products and features faster than ever. Our new product managers &amp; engineers are passionate, technical, and take ownership. It just feels like more things are getting done. \n\nI've liked that the company has embraced the remote first strategy. I moved out of the bay area and have been able to work from different places and be more productive. \n\nFinally, I very much enjoy building things here.

For example, people high-five each other during allhands or in slack about something great someone did and exemplified the company values.",

        "pros": "Before this job, I worked at one of the Big 4 in consulting. I had been developing a tech background in consulting for around a year and a half before joining Labelbox. \n\nI couldn't be happier with my life now. I'll break this down a bit:\n\n- The Industry:\nLabelbox works with cutting-edge AI in every industry, and it's pretty badass. As an AI nerd myself, I get to see how companies are using AI and how Labelbox helps them do that. \n\n- The Leadership:\nI get encouraged by leadership to lean into my intellectual curiosity however it manifests. Leadership constantly checks in to make sure I'm able to manage my daily responsibilities, job goals, and my own greater career goals. I truly feel heard, and this level of attention is something I've never experienced working at a Big 4.\n\n- The People:\nThe work culture is fantastic, and everyone is really exciting and friendly. Since everyone is remote, they have automated systems that make sure you stay connected - not in a \"stay connected and talk about work\" kind of way, but in more of a \"put your work down for a little bit and connect with another person\" kind of way. It's really nice; I've worked here 100% remotely and when I met everyone in person the first time they truly did feel like friends. We all had a big barbecue, and even had private DJ-hosted party at an art gallery venue after! That is a testament to the culture here. \n\nThe Work-Life Balance:\nI have a near-perfect work-life balance due to the company culture. I've been told \"why are you still online, go enjoy your evening\" at 5:30PM PLENTY of times. This job and the people truly respect your time. \n\nVacation Days:\nAlso, there's unlimited PTO - and they mean it. Team members are happy to cover for each other, and there's a lot of intended protocols to make sure that PTO is seamless. There's never any guilt in taking PTO here, which is something I admittedly did feel working at a Big 4 consulting firm. \n\nWorking Remotely:\nThe job is 100% remote, but they do have an office in SF. Truly, you are free to do whichever you want and there's no pressure in either direction. My boss moved to Hawaii...just because. As long as you can do your job, Labelbox is happy so long as you are!",

      "# [How to generate industry-specific data for AI training with Labelbox](https://labelbox.com/blog/how-to-generate-industry-specific-data-for-ai-training-with-labelbox)\nGenerative AI models are becoming increasingly sophisticated thanks to advances in post-training and model alignment tasks. As a result, the demand for models that not only understand language but also grasp the nuances of specific industries is skyrocketing.\n\nWhile general-purpose large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides, they often fall short when faced with tasks requiring deep domain expertise. Many industries require AI systems capable of industry-specific reasoning that can navigate complex, domain-specific scenarios with expert-level understanding.\n\nThe journey to creating AI that truly \"gets\" a particular field goes beyond simply feeding it more data. It requires a targeted approach that focuses on enhancing the model's ability to understand and apply the unique language, concepts, and problem-solving frameworks inherent to a particular field. This is where industry-specific reasoning comes in, and it is the key to unlocking the true potential of AI across sectors like finance, law, medicine, and insurance. By building and using higher quality training data, companies are creating a competitive advantage and opening the door to new opportunities.\n\nThis guide will walk you through the process of generating domain-specific data with the Labelbox data factory to train your LLMs and AI models on industry-specific reasoning. We'll explore real-world examples in finance and law, delve into the intricacies of creating post-training datasets, and provide a step-by-step walkthrough of creating a project in the Labelbox platform. We will also discuss the importance of selecting the right AI trainers and crafting clear instructions and ontology.\n\nBy the end of this guide, you'll be equipped with the knowledge and tools to embark on your own journey toward creating powerful training data to help you build AI models that are not just intelligent, but industry-smart.\n\nExamples of how industry-specific reasoning is becoming a reality\n\nThe power of industry-specific reasoning in AI is not merely theoretical; it's being realized today by forward-thinking companies leveraging advanced tools and expert human insights. Before explaining how to use the Labelbox platform to build a dataset for training models on industry-specific reasons, let's examine two real-world examples where Labelbox has helped clients in the finance and legal sectors expand the capabilities of foundational models.\n\nThese examples showcase how targeted data labeling, guided by domain experts, can enhance an LLM's ability to support different industries. And while each example discusses a specific industry’s use case, we’ll later see how the process and usage of Labelbox can be extended to a much broader range of domains and uses, paving the way for a deeper dive into the practical steps involved in creating your own successful projects.\n\nFinance: Training models on financial analysis\n\nA leading AI lab wanted to improve their LLM’s performance in financial analysis and argumentation. They hoped to train the LLM to provide meaningful insights on any public company when provided a ticker symbol and the latest financial reports of a company. In addition, they wanted the model trained and prepared to answer the most common questions financial analyst might ask.\n\nTo reach this level of financial expertise, they needed training on detailed, domain-specific datasets that were accurately labeled by a team of Chartered Financial Analysts (CFAs) and financial experts. The CFAs needed to have advanced industry knowledge and experience reviewing and analyzing financial models and details.\n\nHowever, they faced two major challenges: (1) sourcing financial experts who could accurately evaluate and rank responses through multi-step analyses, and (2) managing a complex process where each piece of data could take an hour or more to properly analyze and fully label.\n\nThe company turned to Labelbox to help source experts with financial expertise. Labelbox leveraged their Alignerr network of expert human labelers to quickly recruit and onboard a skilled team of financial experts with backgrounds in CFA, MBA, and Masters in Finance. The team built a customized project consisting of a complex ontology, detailed instructions, and numerous attachments per dataset to review and prepare hypothetical questions and scenarios around.\n\nLegal: Automating case evaluation and data discovery\n\nA forward-thinking legal tech company wants to revolutionize how plaintiff firms operate. By using AI-driven tools with industry-specific reasoning, they want to significantly enhance their ability to evaluate cases, analyze key facts and claims, and ultimately deliver results for their clients more efficiently and transparently.\n\nTo achieve this, they needed to imbue their foundational AI model with deep legal expertise, particularly in understanding long legal documents, interpreting insurance and medical bills, and assessing case value.\n\nThe company partnered with Labelbox to create specialized datasets for post-training their model. Labelbox's network of legal experts reviewed a long list of example prompts that were each associated with many multi-page legal documents. They were tasked with identifying key information based on the prompt, crafting well-reasoned responses supported by evidence found in the documents, and evaluating the models responses for accuracy, safety, and reasoning. They were also used to build a dataset based on understanding insurance and medical billing details and learning how to extra the correct details.\n\nSimilar to the finance example above, this project involved creating a custom ontology and using the flexibility of the Labelbox text editor to generate responses to sample prompts from industry experts, identify key data in attached documents, and use their own expertise to properly interpret complex documents.\n\nImportance of high-quality training datasets\n\nThe above finance and legal examples, while distinct in their domain-specific challenges, underscore a fundamental truth about building industry-specific reasoning into AI: the underlying approach remains consistent across industries, whether it's finance, medicine, insurance, or any other specialized field.\n\nAt its core, the process revolves around creating unique and differentiated datasets that capture the specific nuances, knowledge, and reasoning patterns of the target domain. These datasets serve as the bedrock for training models to perform the desired capabilities, enabling them to go beyond general understanding and develop true expertise.\n\nStrategies to remember when planning your project\n\nBefore kicking off a project or starting the process of building a post-training dataset for industry-specific reasoning, organizations should take the time to think through the following steps:\n\nIdentifying key domain-specific competencies required\n\nDefining clear evaluation criteria for expert knowledge\n\nGathering supporting documentation and examples to attach to the project\n\nWriting hypothetical scenarios and questions you want the model to answer\n\nEstablishing metrics for measuring improvement in domain understanding\n\nSetting realistic scope and scale for the training dataset\n\nPreparing a model evaluation process for side-by-side comparisons\n\nThis list may be shortened by some users and for others there may be other key considerations to add; however, we’ve learned that the most successful projects involve advanced planning and often a fair amount of preparation to gather necessary documents, built prompt examples, and think through the key scenarios that require examples and labeled data to sufficiently train the model.\n\nSelecting the right AI trainers\n\nThe next big AI breakthroughs will be fueled by unique, high-quality data. The massive quantity of available data from the internet has been used to train all of the most popular AI models—meaning they all have similar core capabilities and areas of weakness.\n\nTo properly train these models on new domain-specific knowledge and reasoning it’s imperative that we tap into new information and capture data from domain experts. As a result, the focus must be on properly identifying and recruiting AI trainers with unique skills—like the Alignerr network of highly educated industry experts—to label data, generate new responses, evaluate models, and perform critical model post-training alignment tasks.\n\nBased on our experience from leading the Alignerr network and working with AI labs and model builders to form teams of experts, it’s important to keep the following in mind:\n\nDomain expertise: Look for annotators with relevant qualifications, certifications, and experience in the target industry (e.g., CFA, JD, MD).\n\nAnalytical skills: Choose individuals who can demonstrate strong analytical and reasoning abilities.\n\nAttention to detail: Ensure the annotators are meticulous and capable of identifying subtle nuances in the data.\n\nCommunication skills: Select annotators who can clearly articulate their reasoning and provide constructive feedback.\n\nPrevious success metrics: For annotators that have worked on AI training before and used a complete AI platform, then you should be able to review past performance metrics to assist in the evaluations.\n\nAI interviews: Abilities can only be determined so much by reviewing resumes and profiles, so using interviews tailored to their specific background provides the most powerful data.\n\nKey Labelbox features for generating industry-specific training data\n\nHaving outlined strategic considerations to review before starting a project as well as the keys to selecting the right domain experts, the next crucial step is understanding how to operationalize this process efficiently and effectively. This is where a robust and versatile platform like Labelbox becomes indispensable.\n\nLabelbox Platform is an industry-leading software tool with the flexibility and advanced features needed to translate your vision into a concrete, well-structured labeling project tailored for industry-specific reasoning.\n\nFrom selecting the appropriate editor—often the flexible text editor for tasks involving complex analysis and document reviews—to building a comprehensive ontology with a mix of selection tools and free-form text inputs, Labelbox can capture the nuances of your target domain. In addition, the built-in quality assurance and project management capabilities ensure that your project stays on track, maintains high accuracy, and ultimately delivers a dataset that enhances your AI model's performance.\n\nLet's briefly explore the key components of the Labelbox platform that we see used most often in industry-specific reasoning tasks and discuss how they can be leveraged to build the foundation for your industry-specific AI.\n\nData types & editors\n\nLabelbox supports a range of data types, including text, video, image, audio, PDFs, multimodal, and more. For each data type, a customized editor exists to serve as the core interface for labeling that specific data type. While tailored to specific datatypes, the editors are extremely flexible and can be customized to help label and capture the specific data needed for a given industry.\n\nFor most industry-specific reasoning projects, we have seen the core text editor serve as the key editor. It was the editor used in both the finance and legal examples shared earlier. The editor supports these annotation types: entity, relationships, radio classification, checklist classification, and free-form text classification. The latter is often used to capture detailed information and sample responses from domain experts on a given prompt or to provide detailed information on specific information found or extracted from an attached document.\n\nOntology\n\nThe Labelbox ontology defines the structure and categories for labeling data. Ontologies can be reused across different projects and they are required for data labeling, model training, and evaluation. When you are in the editor, the ontology appears in the Tools panel.\n\nOntologies can be customized for any given project and supports classifications, object detection, segmentation, relationships, messaging ranking, prompt rating, step-by-step rating, and more. The available ontology tasks will vary based on the selected editor and data type.\n\nOntologies also allow for hierarchical relationships between classes, allowing you to create complex labeling tasks with detailed information.\n\nQuality assurance\n\nLabelbox offers a suite of quality assurance features to deliver high-quality labeled data, which is particularly crucial when dealing with complex, industry-specific reasoning tasks. Consensus allows you to measure the agreement between multiple labelers on the same data point, providing a statistical measure of confidence in the assigned labels. Benchmarks enable you to incorporate known ground-truth data into your project, allowing you to directly assess labeler accuracy against established standards.\n\nCalibration tools help identify and correct for systematic biases that individual labelers might exhibit, further refining the consistency of your dataset. Moreover, Labelbox Monitor provides real-time insights into your labeling operations, allowing you to track key metrics, identify trends, and quickly spot any outliers in labeler performance. With Monitor, you can proactively address issues and make adjustments as needed, ensuring that your project stays on course.\n\nProject management\n\nLabelbox provides robust project management tools to manage and track your industry-specific reasoning projects from start to finish. Unlike many labeling services and solutions, the Labelbox platform offers transparency into project progress, allowing you to monitor the status of individual tasks, track labeler performance, and gain a clear overview of the entire project's health. Real-time communication features enable seamless interaction with your team of expert labelers, facilitating quick clarification of instructions, addressing questions, and providing feedback directly within the platform.\n\nLabelbox also allows you to build customized workflows tailored to your specific review and quality control processes, ensuring that each piece of data undergoes the appropriate level of scrutiny before being incorporated into your training set. Furthermore, robust data versioning capabilities provide a comprehensive history of all changes made to your data and ontology, allowing for easy rollback if needed and providing a clear audit trail for maintaining data integrity.\n\nCreating an industry-specific reasoning project in Labelbox\n\nHaving explored the core features of the Labelbox platform, let’s examine the key steps to creating and executing on a project to generate new data for training your AI models and apps on industry-specific reasoning.\n\nThis section provides a practical roadmap, walking you through each stage of the process, from crafting clear and comprehensive instructions for your expert labelers to setting up your project within the Labelbox environment, configuring the ideal ontology, managing the labeling operation, and conducting thorough reviews to ensure the highest level of data quality.\n\nUsing these steps as a framework for your project, you can start exploring how the Labelbox Platform can be used for your unique project. You’ll learn what it takes to build a new training dataset for your specific needs.\n\n1. Identify desired outcomes and goals\n\nBefore diving into the mechanics of using Labelbox, it's crucial to establish a clear understanding of your project's objectives. Training frontier models for industry-specific reasoning requires a well-defined target. What specific problem are you trying to solve? What capabilities do you want your model to possess? Answering these questions will guide your data collection and annotation strategy, ultimately determining the success of your project. For example, are you aiming to build a model that can summarize legal documents, predict financial market trends, or diagnose medical conditions? Each of these scenarios demands a different approach to data and annotation.\n\nThis initial phase focuses on defining the desired outcomes and the key capabilities you want your model to achieve. Let's consider a practical example: building a model to assist legal experts in reviewing case files. The desired outcome might be to reduce the time spent on initial case review by automating the identification of key legal arguments and relevant precedents. This translates into key capabilities like: understanding legal terminology, identifying relationships between different parts of a case file, and summarizing complex legal arguments. We need to capture training data that reflects these capabilities. This might include labeled examples of legal arguments, summaries of past cases, and annotations highlighting the relationships between different legal concepts within a document.\n\n2. Write clear instructions\n\nThe quality of your training data hinges on the clarity and completeness of the instructions provided to your AI trainers. Ambiguous guidelines lead to inconsistent annotations, which ultimately undermines the performance of your frontier model. This section outlines the key components of effective instruction design, ensuring your team can accurately and efficiently generate the high-quality data you need.\n\nA comprehensive instruction set begins with a clear overview of the task. Explain the project's overall goal and how the annotations contribute to achieving that goal. Frame the task within the context of the larger project, emphasizing the importance of accurate labeling. For our legal case review example, this overview might explain how the labeled data will train a model to assist lawyers in quickly identifying key information within case files, ultimately saving time and resources.\n\nNext, provide a detailed explanation of the ontology and all relevant terminology. Clearly define each label, category, or rating, avoiding jargon or technical terms that the labelers might not understand. Use simple language and provide real-world examples to illustrate each concept. For instance, instead of simply defining \"legal precedent,\" explain it with a concrete example: \"Legal precedent refers to a previous court decision that serves as a guide for similar cases in the future. For example, the 1954 Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education established a precedent for desegregating public schools.\" Provide multiple examples for each category to cover a range of scenarios. For financial analysis, this might include defining terms like \"bull market,\" \"bear market,\" and \"market volatility,\" each with illustrative examples from real-world financial news.\n\nAddressing edge cases and exceptions is crucial. Anticipate situations where the correct label might be unclear or ambiguous. Provide specific guidance on how to handle these situations. And it’s important to provide guidance on what a trainer should do if they don’t feel qualified or confident in a given task. The instructions should clearly state: \"If you are unsure about the correct label, or if you encounter a situation not covered in these guidelines, do not guess. Instead, flag the case for review by a subject matter expert.\" This emphasis on accuracy over completeness is essential for maintaining data quality.\n\nFinally, establish a clear process for feedback, questions, and clarification. Provide a designated channel for labelers to ask questions, report issues, or suggest improvements to the guidelines. Regularly review and incorporate feedback to refine the instructions and address any ambiguities that arise during the annotation process. This iterative approach ensures that the labeling process becomes more accurate and efficient over time. A well-defined communication channel also empowers labelers to contribute valuable insights based on their experience with the data.\n\n3. Create a new project and select the right editor\n\nYou're ready to create your project within the Labelbox platform. Begin by logging into your Labelbox account. Once logged in, click “Create project.”\n\nThe first step is to select the appropriate data modality or task type for your project. This choice is crucial as it determines the tools and interface available to your labelers. For industry-specific reasoning projects involving long-form text analysis, such as reviewing legal documents or analyzing financial reports, the Text editor is often the most suitable option.\n\nCreate a new project in Labelbox by selecting the appropriate data modality or task type\n\nLabelbox also supports other modalities like image, video, audio, and multimodal chat, allowing you to adapt to various data types. For example, if your project involves evaluating the quality of responses from a large language model in a live chat conversation, you may use the multimodal chat editor. If your project involves processing audio recordings of earnings calls, you may select audio. Select the modality that best reflects the nature of your data.\n\nProvide your project with a descriptive and informative name. This will help you easily identify and manage your project within Labelbox. For our legal case review example, a name like \"Legal Case Review - Contract Analysis\" would be appropriate. For financial analysis, it might be “Financial Report Analysis - Risk Assessment.”\n\nFinally, upload any existing data that you plan to use in the project. Labelbox supports various data formats, making it easy to import your data. This might include PDFs, plain text files, CSV files, or even connections to cloud storage. Consider organizing your data into logical batches or datasets before uploading to simplify project management. While uploading, ensure that your data is properly formatted and structured for optimal use within the Labelbox platform. For large datasets, consider using Labelbox's data import capabilities to streamline the process.\n\n4. Customize your ontology\n\nA well-defined ontology is the backbone of your labeling project. It provides the structure and vocabulary for your AI trainers, ensuring consistency and accuracy in their annotations.\n\nNavigate to the \"Ontology\" tab within your newly created project. This is where you'll define the building blocks of your annotation schema.\n\nExample of an ontology configured to collect both ratings and free responses on a given datarow\n\nClean, thoughtful ontologies help create high-quality labeled data with minimal errors and inconsistencies. Ontologies are an essential part of the Labelbox labeling platform. Every time you create a project or a model in Labelbox, you will need to select an ontology.\n\nAlong with the core objects, classifications, and relationships that you’ll use in the text editor, you can also establish hierarchical relationships between classes if it makes sense for your domain. This allows you to create a more structured and organized ontology. For instance, \"Breach of Contract\" could be a subclass of a more general class called \"Contractual Issue.\" Hierarchical relationships can help your model learn more general concepts from specific examples. They can also make the labeling process more efficient by allowing labelers to quickly navigate through related concepts. For complex ontologies, consider using Labelbox's hierarchical labeling features to simplify the annotation process.\n\nFor most of today’s complex tasks for generative AI, consider incorporating free text fields to capture richer insights from your AI trainers. These fields give the trainers the ability to rewrite prompts or responses, provide detailed feedback, and explain the rationale behind their ratings or labels. This qualitative information can be invaluable for understanding model behavior and improving its performance.\n\nFor instance, a free text field could allow a labeler to explain why they chose a particular label, highlight ambiguities in the data, or suggest improvements to the ontology. This feedback loop is crucial for refining your model and ensuring it aligns with your desired outcomes.\n\n5. Execute the project: label, rate and align\n\nWith your project configured, data loaded, and a robust ontology in place, you're ready to invite your team to begin executing on the tasks and generating new training data.\n\nFirst, invite your selected AI trainers to the project. Labelbox makes it easy to add team members and assign them specific roles. Ensure that each annotator has the necessary training and understands the project's goals, the ontology, and the annotation guidelines. Consider providing a brief onboarding session to familiarize annotators with the Labelbox platform and the specific requirements of your project.\n\nNext, assign data batches to the annotators. Organize your data into manageable batches to streamline the annotation workflow. Labelbox provides tools for batch management, allowing you to distribute data evenly among your team members. Consider assigning smaller batches initially to allow for early feedback and adjustments to the annotation process. As annotators become more proficient, you can increase the batch size.\n\nMonitor the labeling progress regularly. The Labelbox workspace monitor provides dashboards and reporting tools that allow you to track the progress of each annotator and identify any potential bottlenecks or issues. Regular monitoring also allows you to provide timely feedback to annotators and address any questions or concerns they may have. This proactive approach helps maintain data quality and ensures that the project stays on track.\n\nUtilize Consensus, Benchmarks, and Calibration to ensure data quality. These features are essential for maintaining consistency and accuracy in your annotations. Consensus involves having multiple annotators label the same data points and then comparing their annotations. Discrepancies can be discussed and resolved, leading to higher quality data.\n\nBenchmarks are pre-labeled data points that serve as a gold standard for evaluating annotator performance. Regularly testing annotators on benchmarks can help identify areas where they may need additional training or guidance.\n\nCalibration is the process of adjusting the annotation guidelines or training materials based on feedback from annotators and insights gained from consensus and benchmark analysis. This iterative approach ensures that your data quality continuously improves throughout the project lifecycle. By actively managing your team and implementing these quality control measures, you can generate the high-quality training data needed to power your frontier models.\n\n6. Review and perform QA\n\nEven with well-defined instructions and diligent annotators, a robust review process is essential for guaranteeing the highest quality training data.\n\nEstablishing a strong review process within Labelbox allows you to implement multiple layers of quality control. You can configure reviews on a per-project basis, tailoring the process to the specific needs of your task. For example, you might require all annotations to be reviewed by a subject matter expert before being accepted into the training dataset. Alternatively, you could implement a tiered review system, where a subset of annotations are reviewed by a senior annotator, and only those that meet a certain quality threshold are then passed on to a subject matter expert for final review. Labelbox's review workflows can be customized to fit your specific requirements, allowing you to create a scalable and efficient quality control system. Consider implementing a system where annotations are reviewed by a different annotator than the one who originally labeled the data. This helps to catch potential biases or inconsistencies.\n\nBeyond manual review, Labelbox offers AutoQA features that can significantly improve data quality. AutoQA leverages machine learning models to automatically identify potential errors or inconsistencies in your annotations. These features can flag annotations that deviate significantly from the consensus, highlight areas where annotators disagree, or identify annotations that are inconsistent with pre-defined rules or constraints. By proactively identifying potential issues, AutoQA allows you to focus your review efforts on the most critical areas, saving time and resources.\n\nBy combining manual review with AutoQA, you can create a comprehensive quality assurance system that ensures your training data is accurate, consistent, and reliable.

      "# [Google Slashes Gemini Prices, Boosts Performance of AI Models by PYMNTS, www.facebook.com on 2024-09-24](https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2024/google-slashes-prices-upgrades-boosts-performance-ai-models/)\nGoogle’s latest artificial intelligence models could accelerate AI adoption in eCommerce and retail, developers say, as the tech giant unveils upgrades designed to attract more businesses to its Gemini platform.\n\nThe company announced two updated production-ready models in a Tuesday (Sept. 24) blog post, Gemini-1.5-Pro-002 and Gemini-1.5-Flash-002, which offer enhanced capabilities across a range of tasks, including product recommendations, inventory management and customer service automation.\n\n“The new release introduces advanced capabilities in math and vision tasks,” Sujan Abraham, a senior software engineer at AI firm Labelbox, told PYMNTS. “These models are designed for a wide range of tasks, including text, code and multimodal applications. They can process larger and much more complex inputs like 1,000-page PDFs, massive code repos and hour-long videos. These models are faster, better and more cost-efficient for production environments.”\n\nPrice Cuts and Performance Boost\n\nIn a move likely to intensify competition in the AI market, Google is reducing pricing for its Gemini-1.5-Pro model by more than 50% for both input and output on prompts under 128,000 tokens. The company is also doubling rate limits for the 1.5 Flash model and tripling them for 1.5 Pro.\n\n“To make it even easier for developers to build with Gemini, we are increasing the paid tier rate limits for 1.5 Flash to 2,000 RPM and increasing 1.5 Pro to 1,000 RPM, up from 1,000 and 360, respectively,” the post stated.\n\nPerformance improvements are up, with Google reporting an approximate 7% increase in scores on the MMLU-Pro benchmark, which measures general knowledge and reasoning abilities. Both models showed a “considerable ~20% improvement” on math-related benchmarks, according to the post.\n\n“The Gemini 1.5 series is more efficient across the board,” Jorge Argota, founder of an AI consultancy, told PYMNTS. “These models are text, code and multimodal. When dealing with complex math or code, they are more understanding and accurate. This could be a game changer for eCommerce platforms looking to implement advanced AI features.”\n\nArgota highlighted the extended context window as a significant advancement.\n\n“The models can now process up to 2 million tokens, which is a big jump from previous versions,” he said. “This means they can handle long documents and multimedia inputs with ease. For projects with large datasets or long documents, this is a huge win.”\n\nNew Features\n\nThe updates also address speed and efficiency concerns.\n\n“Along with core improvements to our latest models, over the last few weeks we have driven down the latency with 1.5 Flash and significantly increased the output tokens per second, enabling new use cases with our most powerful models,” Google’s blog post said.\n\nArgota noted several key new features, including “Gems, personalized AI assistants,” which allows users to create custom AI assistants for specific tasks. He also mentioned the Imagen 3 model, “an advanced image generation model that produces higher quality images from text prompts,” and Gemini Live, which enhances conversational AI interactions through voice conversations.\n\nThe price reductions and increased rate limits are expected to impact businesses.\n\n“The 15% price drop and increased rate limits is a big win for businesses looking to add AI to their workflows,” Argota said. “The cost savings makes these advanced models more affordable, especially for startups and small businesses that were hesitant to get in due to budget constraints.”\n\nGoogle’s push to make its AI models more attractive to developers comes as competition in the sector intensifies, with rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic also vying for market share.\n\nThe company is betting that these improvements will encourage more developers to build applications using Gemini, potentially leading to broader adoption of Google’s AI technologies.\n\n“We continue to be blown away with the creative and useful applications of Gemini 1.5 Pro’s 2 million token long context window and multimodal capabilities,” the blog post said. “From video understanding to processing 1,000-page PDFs, there are so many new use cases still to be built.”\n\nIn addition to the production models, Google is releasing an experimental version called “Gemini-1.5-Flash-8B-Exp-0924,” which the post said includes “significant performance increases across both text and multimodal use cases.”\n\nThe updates also include changes to the models’ default filter settings, giving developers more control over content moderation.\n\n“For the models released today, the filters will not be applied by default so that developers can determine the configuration best suited for their use case,” the post said.\n\nAs the AI arms race continues, Google’s latest move signals its commitment to remaining competitive in a rapidly evolving market. With these enhancements, the company aims to solidify its position as a provider of AI tools for developers and businesses.\n\n“Overall, a big win for businesses looking to add AI to their workflows,” Argota said.",
