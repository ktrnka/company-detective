      "# [Labelbox Community](https://community.labelbox.com/faq)\nThis is a Civilized Place for Public Discussion\n\nPlease treat this discussion forum with the same respect you would a public park. We, too, are a shared community resource — a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation.\n\nThese are not hard and fast rules. They are guidelines to aid the human judgment of our community and keep this a kind, friendly place for civilized public discourse.\n\nImprove the Discussion\n\nHelp us make this a great place for discussion by always adding something positive to the discussion, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.\n\nOne way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Spend time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.\n\nThe topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.\n\nBe Agreeable, Even When You Disagree\n\nYou may wish to respond by disagreeing. That’s fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid:\n\nName-calling\n\nAd hominem attacks\n\nResponding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content\n\nKnee-jerk contradiction\n\nInstead, provide thoughtful insights that improve the conversation.\n\nYour Participation Counts\n\nThe conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be — and avoiding those that do not.\n\nDiscourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, watching, muting and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.\n\nLet’s leave our community better than we found it.\n\nIf You See a Problem, Flag It\n\nModerators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.\n\nWhen you see bad behavior, don’t reply. Replying encourages bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. Just flag it. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.\n\nIn order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.\n\nAlways Be Civil\n\nNothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:\n\nBe civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.\n\nKeep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.\n\nRespect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.\n\nRespect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.\n\nThese are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of a major news site.\n\nThis is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.\n\nKeep It Tidy\n\nMake the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:\n\nDon’t start a topic in the wrong category; please read the category definitions.\n\nDon’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.\n\nDon’t post no-content replies.\n\nDon’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.\n\nDon’t sign your posts — every post has your profile information attached to it.\n\nRather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.\n\nPost Only Your Own Stuff\n\nYou may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.\n\nPowered by You\n\nThis site is operated by your friendly local staff and you, the community. If you have any further questions about how things should work here, open a new topic in the site feedback category and let’s discuss! If there’s a critical or urgent issue that can’t be handled by a meta topic or flag, contact us via the staff page.\n\nTerms of Service",
      "# [AI model training and diagnostics platform](https://labelbox.com/product/model/)\nAs Large Language Models (LLMs) become more sophisticated, accurately evaluating their performance becomes increasingly critical. While automated metrics provide insights, human evaluation remains the gold standard for understanding nuances like relevance, bias, and overall quality. However, conducting large-scale, high-quality human evaluations is a major challenge for most enterprises, requiring significant time, resources, and expertise.\n\nLabelbox and Google Cloud have partnered to deliver a fully managed LLM evaluation solution directly integrated into the Vertex AI platform. This solution empowers Google Cloud customers to seamlessly launch human evaluation jobs, set specific criteria for evaluation (e.g., question-answering, summarization).",

The projects will require labeling many data with various object tags. Using an open-source tool is an option but will require an engineering effort as I will look for the following features (Mentioned in the next paragraph) to add in the future.   \n\n\nHowever, I am also looking at tools (paid versions such as label box, roboflow, superannotate, etc) that can make the labeling effort faster from day one. The tool needs to have the following features:  \n\n\n* Easy to visualize data and annotations\n* Data embedding \n* Custom labeling and review workflows \n* Model-assisted labeling  and auto-labeling tool  \n\n\nI would appreciate it if I could get some feedback from the broader computer vision community about their experiences of using the paid version tool.   \n\n\nWhat was the tool that you used for your project and why?   \n\n\nIf the opportunity is provided again, would you pick up the same tool?

The only thing you need to spend a little time on is to understand how to write the ML Backend for auto-labelling and ML assisted labelling - and they have very nice examples for all usual vision tasks which you can just copy paste.

However, after uploading the selected images, it doesn’t show how many images have been uploaded. And it doesn't have a complication button to finish uploading which is a bit confusing. This could be a problem if the data is massive.\n\n    Labelbox -----easy and clear to upload  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lz89szkritv51.png?width=872&format=png&auto=webp&s=f62319f0b28f5815d42cd8bd54400d786abcc67d\n\nOnce I sign in, I can start to upload your own data and it shows how many images have been added and easily to complete uploading. Like dLabel you can see your items after uploading the dataset, set annotation tool etc.\n\n    Spervisely  -------Hard to upload for first time users \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b0v5vbusitv51.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=2220053a3a5bfaccb96d237dc005064bb6c2931f\n\nThough it has a small demonstration Gif, it still takes more time to import the images as it has too many unnecessary steps such as asking about the uploading way and you can only add the project name after uploading your dataset.\n\n**2 adding annotation objects**\n\n    dLabel     \n\nI can add annotation objects at both after uploading your dataset and whenever you want. And it has this “attribute” function” where you can define, add more information, classify the objects. But I can not edit the added annotation objects.\n\n    Labelbox \n\nLike dLabel, you can create annotation objects whenever you want. However, it is less convenient than dLabel as you need to go to the editor’s page and edit or add more annotation objects. There is “classification” function where you can classify the objects. I personally like the “attribute “ feature from dLabel more and it can contain more information about the objects.\n\n    Spervisely  \n\nAdding and modifying the annotation objects are easy and clear. There is no feature like or similar to “attribute” from dLabel or “classification” form Labelbox. One good part is that I can personalize my own hotkeys for each object, which can adapt an individual's annotation habit.\n\n**3 Annotation speed for 30 frames.**\n\nThe data set is 30images. Using bonding boxes. 2 annotation objects (hand and drink)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||uploading data time|annotation time|clicks per frame|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|dLabel|1 min|9 min|7 clicks|\n|Labelbox|1 min|11 min 10 sec|7 clicks|\n|Supervisly|2 min|11 min 30 sec|9 clicks|\n\n**4 layout of the annotation page**\n\n    dLabel  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/63kfjmluitv51.png?width=1367&format=png&auto=webp&s=d40dfe571254ff2aa118b03bb6873eabde286c72\n\nYou have the features at the left, the statues in the right and the image in the centre.\n\nOne the left side, there is one “group” feature which I found is very useful. It adds interaction between objects. Like you set the “tomato” and the “hand” into one group which indicates they have interactions. The hand is picking the tomato.\n\nThere is a history column on the right where you can also trace the annotation history on the right.\n\nOn the bottom of the centre, there’s one QA bar which can come in hand when doing quality control.\n\n    Labelbox\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fkpotowvitv51.png?width=1374&format=png&auto=webp&s=13d08cf8b70f37e80c7ff061d3295578579f124f\n\nI personally find the layout too simple. There are not many features. So There is nothing much to say.\n\n    Spervisely\n    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fm4iwqnxitv51.png?width=1425&format=png&auto=webp&s=21281956ae70f25c7d3bad64d54b5dfc27116e0d\n\nthe right side features are bit confusing...\n\nI didn't quite understand what are\"image properties\" and \"objects properties\".\n\nIt shows the annotation history which Labelbox doesn't have hotkeys easily .\n\n## Comment ID gaddbvk with +16 score by [(timmy-burton, Reddit, 2020-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/jjls17/d_annotation_tools_comparison/gaddbvk/) (in reply to ID jjls17):\nYou should probably try CVAT as well.\n\n### Comment ID gaedwx1 with +2 score by [(darknight_upenn, Reddit, 2020-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/jjls17/d_annotation_tools_comparison/gaedwx1/) (in reply to ID gaddbvk):\nCVAT is the best so far, IMO.\n\n#### Comment ID gaghk9l with +1 score by [(debbydai, Reddit, 2020-10-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/jjls17/d_annotation_tools_comparison/gaghk9l/) (in reply to ID gaedwx1):\noh. i will for sure have a try.\n\n### Comment ID gaghikx with +1 score by [(debbydai, Reddit, 2020-10-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/jjls17/d_annotation_tools_comparison/gaghikx/) (in reply to ID gaddbvk):\nyes. i have heard of CVAT . well try it later and share my thoughts as well. thanks !!!\n\n## Comment ID gadd2ol with +3 score by [(weetbix2, Reddit, 2020-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/jjls17/d_annotation_tools_comparison/gadd2ol/) (in reply to ID jjls17):\nNice!

Being onboarded for a role, doesn't mean that the project is already active or that you've been allocated to it.\n\nA few things you should be aware of:\n\n1 - You will be allocated to a specific project pod in Slack. There you will have information (usually in pinned posts) about type of tasks (i.e calibration, production, etc), deadlines and materials. If you haven't been added yet, just be patient. Things are just starting, you will see tasks when they are available and the project leader / admin will inform everyone on slack.\n\n2 - In case you were onboarded for more than one role, click on your initials icon (bottom left corner) on labelbox, and select 'switch workplace'.

You send data via an API call, their system makes a guess, and a human will give the final check. So essentially, semi-supervised learning as a service (SLaaS, you're welcome). It's being used by huge companies like OpenAI, Baidu, AirBnB.\n\nI guess my question is.. why is it so valuable? They have clearly simplified the workflow for gathering training data through their platform and human outsourcing. But what makes their method special? Why can't another company replicate it- it seems like a project magnitudes cheaper than $1 billion.\n\nIs the initial estimation algorithm proprietary and does it hold a lot of their value? Is the efficiency and accuracy of their human-labelling side unmatched?\n\nNote: these are genuine questions and should not be read as if they're rhetorical.\n\n## Comment ID focowkl with +20 score by [(igorsusmelj, Reddit, 2020-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/g6r0yv/d_scale_ai_what_separates_them_and_why_are_they/focowkl/) (in reply to ID g6r0yv):\nScale is not the only company doing annotation. There's a whole list here:  https://data-annotation.com/list-of-data-annotation-companies \nPlayment and Scale (both doing similar services) have been part of YCombinator. Other companies such as Appen already IPOd years ago. They started with simple outsourcing tasks.\n\nThere is now a new wave of startups trying to improve the workflow and tools of such outsourcing tasks using ML. At the same time they each try to build a platform out of it. At the moment they might be replaceable but if one manages to succeed they might become some sort of standard for everyone. \nThat's at least how I would see it. Whether the valuation is justified is another question....\n\nDisclaimer: I'm the author of the blog\n\n### Comment ID fod2qsc with +3 score by [(catandDuck, Reddit, 2020-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/g6r0yv/d_scale_ai_what_separates_them_and_why_are_they/fod2qsc/) (in reply to ID focowkl):\nI like the table breakdown, there are many more services than I expected.

Sure, there are many \"if\"s involved, but imho there is a chance a large portion of low-sophistication, off-the-shelve \"data science\" work (collect some data in a pandas dataframe, run some default scikit learn models to make predictions, make some shiny visualizations) will eventually include fine-tuning sota models in a supervised fashion to include knowledge extracted from text (and images?). Thus compared to today, there would be far more companies requireing labeing data.\n\nIf something like this happens, my (sad) experience is that if there is some company offering labeling as a service that lists a few major players as its customers, that can be enough to make execs prefer them. **If** something like this happens, I think Scale AIs headstart and marketing may actually be enough to make them really profitable regardless of if competitors are offer similar or even slightly better services.\n\nApart from that, obviously I would not rule out hype and overvaluation as mentioned in other comments.\n\n### Comment ID fofaf5i with +3 score by [(catandDuck, Reddit, 2020-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/g6r0yv/d_scale_ai_what_separates_them_and_why_are_they/fofaf5i/) (in reply to ID foexn8o):\nThis is an interesting perspective and it makes sense generally.

That doesn't help of course because at the end of the day, you need to pay bills, and I too was dependent on the income.\n\n## Comment ID le7xfk3 with +1 score by [(Organic-Olive-3044, Reddit, 2024-07-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/outlier_ai/comments/1e6843g/looks_like_i_got_booted/le7xfk3/) (in reply to ID 1e6843g):\nOutlier sucks!

Don't get me wrong, Manu is a good dude but he's gotta get out of of the way sometimes. Revenue is surprisingly low considering the valuation. I suspect Labelbox will remain a medium-sized business for a while rather than live up to the rapid growth trajectory we expect many startups to follow in Silicon Valley.

I get to build tools that are enabling fascinating AI uses cases across so many industries. \n\nFirst of all, I couldn't be more excited about working with the new head of engineering. The current engineering leader is highly technical and comes from Autodesk. Autodesk has many similarities to Labelbox as both companies build highly complex software systems (graphics &amp; backend). I am more optimistic and enthusiastic about working on products than ever before. It's a night and day difference compared to the previous leadership in the product and engineering. The former engineering leader wasn't decisive and didn't act fast or did much. For example, our CI/CD has been sub-par for a long time. The new engineering leader quickly identified this and is leading the change. When the CEO let go of the former director of product and VPE, I wasn't sure about the decision. But now, after seeing the new state, it all makes sense. We are shipping new innovative products and features faster than ever. Our new product managers &amp; engineers are passionate, technical, and take ownership. It just feels like more things are getting done. \n\nI've liked that the company has embraced the remote first strategy. I moved out of the bay area and have been able to work from different places and be more productive. \n\nFinally, I very much enjoy building things here. It's the first company I have worked for where the company values are used to make decisions daily. For example, people high-five each other during allhands or in slack about something great someone did and exemplified the company values.",

          "pros": "Before this job, I worked at one of the Big 4 in consulting. I had been developing a tech background in consulting for around a year and a half before joining Labelbox. \n\nI couldn't be happier with my life now. I'll break this down a bit:\n\n- The Industry:\nLabelbox works with cutting-edge AI in every industry, and it's pretty badass. As an AI nerd myself, I get to see how companies are using AI and how Labelbox helps them do that. \n\n- The Leadership:\nI get encouraged by leadership to lean into my intellectual curiosity however it manifests. Leadership constantly checks in to make sure I'm able to manage my daily responsibilities, job goals, and my own greater career goals. I truly feel heard, and this level of attention is something I've never experienced working at a Big 4.\n\n- The People:\nThe work culture is fantastic, and everyone is really exciting and friendly. Since everyone is remote, they have automated systems that make sure you stay connected - not in a \"stay connected and talk about work\" kind of way, but in more of a \"put your work down for a little bit and connect with another person\" kind of way. It's really nice; I've worked here 100% remotely and when I met everyone in person the first time they truly did feel like friends. We all had a big barbecue, and even had private DJ-hosted party at an art gallery venue after! That is a testament to the culture here. \n\nThe Work-Life Balance:\nI have a near-perfect work-life balance due to the company culture. I've been told \"why are you still online, go enjoy your evening\" at 5:30PM PLENTY of times. This job and the people truly respect your time. \n\nVacation Days:\nAlso, there's unlimited PTO - and they mean it. Team members are happy to cover for each other, and there's a lot of intended protocols to make sure that PTO is seamless. There's never any guilt in taking PTO here, which is something I admittedly did feel working at a Big 4 consulting firm. \n\nWorking Remotely:\nThe job is 100% remote, but they do have an office in SF. Truly, you are free to do whichever you want and there's no pressure in either direction. My boss moved to Hawaii...just because. As long as you can do your job, Labelbox is happy so long as you are!",

There are also sponsored daily lunch for all employees.\n\nWhile interviewing, one of my concerns was reading Glassdoor about a very hands-on CEO. That was the exact situation I dealt with at my last company that led an extremely poor work-life balance and eventually was the cause of my departure there. However, I have experienced Manu (the Labelbox CEO) to be a great communicator and collaborator thus far. The work-life balance has been very enjoyable and the entire team is friendly. So that's why I wanted to share my experience here - most of the negative reviews I read seem to be pretty outdated or from disgruntled ex-employees.",

If I wanted a chill but boring life I would just go over to an established company. I think some of the negative reviews in Glassdoor have some merit but life here isn't as bad as they make it out to be. I've been at a toxic company before and this one is far from it. The people are actually quite well intentioned, and maybe there is some immature leadership but it's not all that bad. \r\n\r\nI think a lot of Labelbox's sad days are behind it.

They were always good, but I am optimistic they will only keep getting better (talking medical/dental/vision here)\n• The daily lunch allowance they give us is my love language\n• Most flexible job I have ever had. As long as I go to the meetings I am supposed to, I feel completely free to get my work done at the times that are the most convenient for me.\n• Great remote culture. I feel like I know more coworkers better than at my last in office job because of the ways the help us stay engaged remotely.\n• Competitive compensation packages\n• I truly feel a connection to the company mission and feel like I am making an impact.

I get to build tools that are enabling fascinating AI uses cases across so many industries. \n\nFirst of all, I couldn't be more excited about working with the new head of engineering. The current engineering leader is highly technical and comes from Autodesk. Autodesk has many similarities to Labelbox as both companies build highly complex software systems (graphics &amp; backend). I am more optimistic and enthusiastic about working on products than ever before. It's a night and day difference compared to the previous leadership in the product and engineering. The former engineering leader wasn't decisive and didn't act fast or did much. For example, our CI/CD has been sub-par for a long time. The new engineering leader quickly identified this and is leading the change. When the CEO let go of the former director of product and VPE, I wasn't sure about the decision. But now, after seeing the new state, it all makes sense. We are shipping new innovative products and features faster than ever. Our new product managers &amp; engineers are passionate, technical, and take ownership. It just feels like more things are getting done. \n\nI've liked that the company has embraced the remote first strategy. I moved out of the bay area and have been able to work from different places and be more productive. \n\nFinally, I very much enjoy building things here. It's the first company I have worked for where the company values are used to make decisions daily. For example, people high-five each other during allhands or in slack about something great someone did and exemplified the company values.",

        "pros": "Before this job, I worked at one of the Big 4 in consulting. I had been developing a tech background in consulting for around a year and a half before joining Labelbox. \n\nI couldn't be happier with my life now. I'll break this down a bit:\n\n- The Industry:\nLabelbox works with cutting-edge AI in every industry, and it's pretty badass. As an AI nerd myself, I get to see how companies are using AI and how Labelbox helps them do that. \n\n- The Leadership:\nI get encouraged by leadership to lean into my intellectual curiosity however it manifests. Leadership constantly checks in to make sure I'm able to manage my daily responsibilities, job goals, and my own greater career goals. I truly feel heard, and this level of attention is something I've never experienced working at a Big 4.\n\n- The People:\nThe work culture is fantastic, and everyone is really exciting and friendly. Since everyone is remote, they have automated systems that make sure you stay connected - not in a \"stay connected and talk about work\" kind of way, but in more of a \"put your work down for a little bit and connect with another person\" kind of way. It's really nice; I've worked here 100% remotely and when I met everyone in person the first time they truly did feel like friends. We all had a big barbecue, and even had private DJ-hosted party at an art gallery venue after! That is a testament to the culture here. \n\nThe Work-Life Balance:\nI have a near-perfect work-life balance due to the company culture. I've been told \"why are you still online, go enjoy your evening\" at 5:30PM PLENTY of times. This job and the people truly respect your time. \n\nVacation Days:\nAlso, there's unlimited PTO - and they mean it. Team members are happy to cover for each other, and there's a lot of intended protocols to make sure that PTO is seamless. There's never any guilt in taking PTO here, which is something I admittedly did feel working at a Big 4 consulting firm. \n\nWorking Remotely:\nThe job is 100% remote, but they do have an office in SF. Truly, you are free to do whichever you want and there's no pressure in either direction. My boss moved to Hawaii...just because. As long as you can do your job, Labelbox is happy so long as you are!",

However, I have experienced Manu (the Labelbox CEO) to be a great communicator and collaborator thus far. The work-life balance has been very enjoyable and the entire team is friendly.

I suspect Labelbox will remain a medium-sized business for a while rather than live up to the rapid growth trajectory we expect many startups to follow in Silicon Valley. Revenue will probably top out once people start pushing back on high pricing.",

We are disappointed to see that Labelbox has decided to make a complicated and expensive solution out of text extraction from PDF’s by using Google Document AI instead of just PDF.js. This would save Labelbox a ton of time, money, and avoid using shoddy OCR technology. What is worse is that most of our documents are going to be over the 15 page limit that Google Document AI applies.\n\nLabelbox has gone from one of my favorite products to something we probably can’t use unless Google Document AI is scrapped for PDF.js\n\nHey @gunderwood I super appreciate your investment in my concern/issue and for critically thinking about a solution that will work for me moving forward. I want to add some additional context to what my ideal solution is so we can keep trying to figure something out together!\n\nWe want to select a piece of text in a PDF document in a way that:\n\nis aware of the PDF layout (cell wrapping, dual columns, etc.),\n\nallows text to be pulled from the underlying document itself (with no OCR),\n\nand is able to export that text to a format for machine learning outside of the labeling platform.\n\nAll while being as convenient as possible for the annotator - something I know Labelbox’s product team is also very keen on!\n\nNote: for scanned or photographed PDF’s, as well as images, we will plan to use OCR, we’re not unreasonable We only want to use OCR to get something into a text format when it isn’t that already - so that it can then be parsed on a computer.\n\nWe don’t want to use OCR to take a text format that is already being parsed by a computer, convert it to an image, and then spend a bunch of resources to turn it back into a different, worse text format.\n\nI am happy to jump on a zoom call with you, if you’d like to discuss, screen share, brainstorm, etc. Thanks again for your attention!",
      "# [Labelbox IPO on 2024-08-01](https://www.linqto.com/ipo/labelbox/)\nSummary*\n\nLabelbox, founded in 2018 and headquartered in San Francisco, California, is a leading developer of training data platforms for machine learning teams.

      "# [Products, Competitors, Financials, Employees, Headquarters Locations](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/labelbox)\nSecret to AI profitability is hiring a lot more doctorates\n\nIn India, a radiologist training AI models might earn pay of 100,000 rupees (US$1,200/RM5,312) for a few hours of work, said Hardik Dave, founder and chief executive of Indika AI, a popular data labeling firm. The average contractor makes about a third of that a month, he said. — Reuters In the tiny kingdom of Bhutan, dozens of data experts perfect artificial intelligence models from offices framed by majestic Himalayan peaks. The employees at iMerit aren’t there to train AI in rudimentary tasks like recognising \"brown cat on a windowsill” in an image. Instead, they’re teaching algorithms the anatomy of the human eye or how to detect changes in geospatial maps. Backed by three Silicon Valley billionaires, iMerit is part of a growing cohort of companies building a more sophisticated, monetisable and reliable version of AI, an industry on track to add nearly US$20 trillion (RM88.53 trillion) to the global economy by 2030. As models become smarter, big business is increasingly looking to harness their power for highly specialised tasks, spawning dozens of data services startups devoted to customising applications across sectors like finance, health care and defense. There’s a lot at stake. Even as AI fervour has swept through Silicon Valley, nagging questions persist about whether the technology will actually prove useful enough for businesses around the world to pay up for it and ensure that AI model developers can turn a profit. Of course, Nvidia Corp has become the most valuable company in the world by selling AI chips. But the firm’s biggest customers, including Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc, are still losing money from the immense cost of building more advanced AI systems. Radha Basu, the founder and chief executive officer of iMerit, drew a parallel to software coders who built the Internet, mobile phones and other modern tech platforms. \"We’re coder equivalents of the AI revolution,” said the grey-haired entrepreneur, who’s preparing to raise her next round of funding. Getting AI to advanced proficiency in unrelated, sensitive and sometimes dangerous industries won’t be easy. The undertaking requires a deep bench of human experts willing to add to their day jobs by training and improving models in technical fields. In Kenya, a startup is developing technology to scan the bush for signs of poachers. In Kazakhstan, medical experts are teaching models to identify the early stages of lung cancer. In India, Korea, Vietnam and elsewhere, linguists earning US$65 (RM287) an hour are helping models become proficient in languages other than English. At iMerit, which employs 5,000 people in Bhutan, India and New Orleans, Yeshi Wangmo, 23, who hails from a family of farmers, has spent years mastering a single task: correctly identifying weeds and debris in images of vast fields of corn and cotton. Wangmo and her colleagues, dressed in colourful Bhutanese gho and kira wraps, help companies like Blue River Technology, a subsidiary of Deere & Co, build algorithms that improve accuracy when spraying pesticides and fertilisers, reducing use by as much as 90%. \"We are seeing companies tackle more advanced but also increasingly niche problems,” said Ivan Lee, founder and CEO of data labeling solutions firm Datasaur Inc, whose customers include Netflix Inc and the FBI. \"Clients may need dentists who grew up in Tanzania or architects from France,” said Lee, whose teams mainly work out of Indonesia. Data accuracy is the lodestar of their work. When ChatGPT was launched two years ago, critics were quick to pick apart the platform’s flaws and lapses. Since then, scores of human experts have been hired for quality control. The work is painstaking. Data labelers like Wangmo pore over scans, photos, video and text to ready AI models. The goal is to improve generative AI systems that are trained on vast data sets to analyse or create new content. Perfecting them removes the discrepancy between potential capabilities of AI and its actual performance in the real world. Such specialisation is increasingly key in high-stakes sectors like those that deal with military intelligence, according to Kathleen Walch, director and general manager at the research firm PMI Cognilytica. Lower-level versions of this work aren’t new. The data services industry began about two decades ago. Back then, labellers living in places like the Philippines and India primarily tagged small data sets that underpinned, for instance, speech recognition for voice assistants or search engines on shopping websites. Critics worry that AI has created an exploitable underclass, pointing to salaries that hover around a few dollars a day in some pockets of the industry. But over the years, as AI has improved, much of the simpler stuff is now automated. Demand has shifted to recruiting specialists and paying higher salaries and rates, though they’re still considerably lower than compensation packages for data scientists in Silicon Valley. In India, a radiologist training AI models might earn pay of 100,000 rupees (US$1,200/RM5,312) for a few hours of work, said Hardik Dave, founder and chief executive of Indika AI, a popular data labeling firm. The average contractor makes about a third of that a month, he said. Today, startups selling labeling services attract marquee investors. This summer, the largest player, Scale AI, raised money from Meta Platforms Inc and Amazon.com Inc. With a nearly US$14bil (RM62bil) valuation, the company has vaulted past the figures for prominent AI model builders like Mistral and Cohere. In 2023, Sequoia’s list of the top 50 AI companies featured four labeling startups, up from just one the previous year. One firm, Labelbox, is backed by Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins. Another, Snorkel AI, is funded by Alphabet Inc.’s venture arm at a valuation of US$1bil (RM4.42bil). More broadly, the market for data labellers, valued at nearly US$20bil (RM89bil) in 2024, is projected to grow around 20% annually until 2030, according to Grand View Research, a market research firm based in San Francisco. The consequences of a misstep are also weightier. A mislabeled frame could cost a business millions of dollars, inviting lawsuits or even causing death. Cancer-scanning AI tools or self-driving cars are two sensitive areas. \"Less accurate AI can go off the rails,” said Wendy Gonzalez, CEO of the Los Gatos-based Sama, whose clients include Ford Motor Co. and Walmart Inc. \"Businesses can’t afford that.” Consider the tie-up between Massachusetts General Hospital and Centaur Labs, a data labeling startup with 50,000 freelancers based in countries including the US, Kazakhstan and Vietnam. In recent years, Boston-based Centaur Labs has improved products used in the hospital, gradually bringing in higher-skilled data experts. Some are related to everyday maladies. (The startup is working on a snore-detection algorithm and an app for sleep apnea.) Others stray into heavier topics like developing AI that can more precisely identify lung nodules in CT scans. Last month, the startup announced an injection of capital from Accel, Y Combinator and others. Polina Pilius, a radiologist in Kazakhstan who oversees teams for a contractor of Centaur Labs, said the work keeps getting narrower. Today, she said, it’s not enough to merely detect lung nodules. Clients increasingly want specialized features that reduce the number of false positives and track the growth of nodules over time. Reducing risk without cutting corners is the sweet spot. \"Medical data annotation is a complex process that cannot tolerate haste, incompetence, inattention or excessive cost-cutting,” Pilius said. Despite all that can go wrong, AI’s proponents argue that training models to tackle complex issues in risky sectors is preferable to doing nothing. In many instances, there’s only upside, they say. Labelbox, the San Francisco-based startup, works with a client that sells dash cam analysis to companies overseeing hundreds of thousands of trucks. Over the past year, Labelbox data specialists have trained AI bots to become even more expert at monitoring whether a driver is drowsy or inebriated. Once detected, fleet operators are alerted and the driver is contacted. Manu Sharma, the CEO of Labelbox, said this is just one example where models are doing more than simply cutting costs or improving efficiency. The best technology is life-saving, he said, and data labelers are on the front-line of advancing AI’s capabilities. They’re \"creating a world in which their expertise is more accessible and can be applied to benefit society,” he said. – Bloomberg Open Modal",

      "# [Google Slashes Gemini Prices, Boosts Performance of AI Models by PYMNTS, www.facebook.com on 2024-09-24](https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2024/google-slashes-prices-upgrades-boosts-performance-ai-models/)\nGoogle’s latest artificial intelligence models could accelerate AI adoption in eCommerce and retail, developers say, as the tech giant unveils upgrades designed to attract more businesses to its Gemini platform.\n\nThe company announced two updated production-ready models in a Tuesday (Sept. 24) blog post, Gemini-1.5-Pro-002 and Gemini-1.5-Flash-002, which offer enhanced capabilities across a range of tasks, including product recommendations, inventory management and customer service automation.\n\n“The new release introduces advanced capabilities in math and vision tasks,” Sujan Abraham, a senior software engineer at AI firm Labelbox, told PYMNTS. “These models are designed for a wide range of tasks, including text, code and multimodal applications. They can process larger and much more complex inputs like 1,000-page PDFs, massive code repos and hour-long videos. These models are faster, better and more cost-efficient for production environments.”\n\nPrice Cuts and Performance Boost\n\nIn a move likely to intensify competition in the AI market, Google is reducing pricing for its Gemini-1.5-Pro model by more than 50% for both input and output on prompts under 128,000 tokens. The company is also doubling rate limits for the 1.5 Flash model and tripling them for 1.5 Pro.\n\n“To make it even easier for developers to build with Gemini, we are increasing the paid tier rate limits for 1.5 Flash to 2,000 RPM and increasing 1.5 Pro to 1,000 RPM, up from 1,000 and 360, respectively,” the post stated.\n\nPerformance improvements are up, with Google reporting an approximate 7% increase in scores on the MMLU-Pro benchmark, which measures general knowledge and reasoning abilities. Both models showed a “considerable ~20% improvement” on math-related benchmarks, according to the post.\n\n“The Gemini 1.5 series is more efficient across the board,” Jorge Argota, founder of an AI consultancy, told PYMNTS. “These models are text, code and multimodal. When dealing with complex math or code, they are more understanding and accurate. This could be a game changer for eCommerce platforms looking to implement advanced AI features.”\n\nArgota highlighted the extended context window as a significant advancement.\n\n“The models can now process up to 2 million tokens, which is a big jump from previous versions,” he said. “This means they can handle long documents and multimedia inputs with ease. For projects with large datasets or long documents, this is a huge win.”\n\nNew Features\n\nThe updates also address speed and efficiency concerns.\n\n“Along with core improvements to our latest models, over the last few weeks we have driven down the latency with 1.5 Flash and significantly increased the output tokens per second, enabling new use cases with our most powerful models,” Google’s blog post said.\n\nArgota noted several key new features, including “Gems, personalized AI assistants,” which allows users to create custom AI assistants for specific tasks. He also mentioned the Imagen 3 model, “an advanced image generation model that produces higher quality images from text prompts,” and Gemini Live, which enhances conversational AI interactions through voice conversations.\n\nThe price reductions and increased rate limits are expected to impact businesses.\n\n“The 15% price drop and increased rate limits is a big win for businesses looking to add AI to their workflows,” Argota said. “The cost savings makes these advanced models more affordable, especially for startups and small businesses that were hesitant to get in due to budget constraints.”\n\nGoogle’s push to make its AI models more attractive to developers comes as competition in the sector intensifies, with rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic also vying for market share.\n\nThe company is betting that these improvements will encourage more developers to build applications using Gemini, potentially leading to broader adoption of Google’s AI technologies.\n\n“We continue to be blown away with the creative and useful applications of Gemini 1.5 Pro’s 2 million token long context window and multimodal capabilities,” the blog post said. “From video understanding to processing 1,000-page PDFs, there are so many new use cases still to be built.”\n\nIn addition to the production models, Google is releasing an experimental version called “Gemini-1.5-Flash-8B-Exp-0924,” which the post said includes “significant performance increases across both text and multimodal use cases.”\n\nThe updates also include changes to the models’ default filter settings, giving developers more control over content moderation.\n\n“For the models released today, the filters will not be applied by default so that developers can determine the configuration best suited for their use case,” the post said.\n\nAs the AI arms race continues, Google’s latest move signals its commitment to remaining competitive in a rapidly evolving market. With these enhancements, the company aims to solidify its position as a provider of AI tools for developers and businesses.\n\n“Overall, a big win for businesses looking to add AI to their workflows,” Argota said.",

      "# [A globally sampled high-resolution hand-labeled validation dataset for evaluating surface water extent maps by Arellano-Thompson](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/16/4311/2024/)\nEffective monitoring of global water resources is increasingly critical due to climate change and population growth. Advancements in remote sensing technology, specifically in spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, are revolutionizing water resource monitoring, leading to more frequent and high-quality surface water extent maps using various techniques such as traditional image processing and machine learning algorithms. However, satellite imagery datasets contain trade-offs that result in inconsistencies in performance, such as disparities in measurement principles between optical (e.g., Sentinel-2) and radar (e.g., Sentinel-1) sensors and differences in spatial and spectral resolutions among optical sensors. Therefore, developing accurate and robust surface water mapping solutions requires independent validations from multiple datasets to identify potential biases within the imagery and algorithms. However, high-quality validation datasets are expensive to build, and few contain information on water resources. For this purpose, we introduce a globally sampled, high-spatial-resolution dataset labeled using 3 m PlanetScope imagery (Planet Team, 2017). Our surface water extent dataset comprises 100 images, each with a size of 1024×1024 pixels, which were sampled using a stratified random sampling strategy covering all 14 biomes. We highlighted urban and rural regions, lakes, and rivers, including braided rivers and coastal regions. We evaluated two surface water extent mapping methods using our dataset – Dynamic World (Brown et al., 2022), based on Sentinel-2, and the NASA IMPACT model (Paul and Ganju, 2021), based on Sentinel-1. Dynamic World achieved a mean intersection over union (IoU) of 72.16 % and F1 score of 79.70 %, while the NASA IMPACT model had a mean IoU of 57.61 % and F1 score of 65.79 %. Performance varied substantially across biomes, highlighting the importance of evaluating models on diverse landscapes to assess their generalizability and robustness. Our dataset can be used to analyze satellite products and methods, providing insights into their advantages and drawbacks. Our dataset offers a unique tool for analyzing satellite products, aiding the development of more accurate and robust surface water monitoring solutions. The dataset can be accessed via https://doi.org/10.25739/03nt-4f29 (Mukherjee et al., 2024).\n\nMapping surface water is becoming increasingly important due to the impacts of climate change, as many regions face the prospect of droughts (Dai, 2013) and floods (Tellman et al., 2021). Timely, accurate, and reliable monitoring of surface water extent is critical for better management, conservation, and risk-reduction practices, but this remains a growing challenge for researchers. Remotely sensed satellite data have provided a unique vantage point for measuring surface water extent (Bijeesh and Narasimhamurthy, 2020; Mueller et al., 2016) using different measurement principles such as optical and radar sensors (Markert et al., 2018). Recent advances in satellite sensors have increased spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, leading to significant growth in methods for monitoring surface water using multiple satellite products (Pekel et al., 2016; Martinis et al., 2022; Giezendanner et al., 2023). Among these methods, machine learning and deep learning algorithms gained popularity due to their ability to leverage large volumes of satellite data (both public and commercial) to accurately map the Earth's surface (Isikdogan et al., 2017; Wieland et al., 2023).\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of satellite water products based on different sensors is not consistent across all conditions, as each product involves trade-offs between spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions (Wulder et al., 2015). Higher-spatial-resolution products like PlanetScope (PS) often produce more accurate maps than lower-resolution Sentinel-2 (10 m) or Landsat 8 (30 m) data (Acharki, 2022). Moreover, radar and optical sensors measure surface water properties differently, leading to variations in accuracy and suitability (Martinis et al., 2022), even at similar spatial resolutions. The study by Ghayour et al. (2021) compared Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 and found performance varied across methods. As Wolpert (2002) asserted, no single algorithm is expected to perform optimally in every situation. The study by Li et al. (2022) summarizes the current common methods of water extraction based on optical and radar images.\n\nIndependently evaluating satellite products and methods using independent validation datasets is crucial for increasing trust in the results (Bamber and Bindschadler, 1997). However, such datasets are resource-intensive to create, and existing ones may not be suitable for all needs. For example, BigEarthNet (Sumbul et al., 2019) contains around 600 000 multi-labeled Sentinel-2 image patches, of which 83 000 contain water bodies. This dataset confirms the presence of water within a patch but does not delineate it at the pixel level. The Chesapeake Conservancy land cover dataset (Chesapeake Bay Program, 2023) provides high-resolution (1 m) per-pixel water labels for the Chesapeake Bay watershed regional area. LandCoverNet (Alemohammad and Booth, 2020) contains global 10 m resolution data from Sentinel-2 with a water class. Flood mapping has also been a strong research focus, with datasets like the Sentinel-1-based NASA flood detection (Gahlot et al., 2021), Sen1Floods11 (Bonafilia et al., 2020), Sen12-Flood (Rambour et al., 2020), and C2S-MS Floods (Cloud to Street et al., 2022) that use both optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) imagery. While suitable for validating surface water maps, some of these datasets rely on 10 m resolution public satellite imagery or lack global coverage at high resolution. The ephemeral nature of floods also requires specialized detection models even though floodwater is technically surface water (Bonafilia et al., 2020). Wieland et al. (2023) developed a semiautomated global binary surface water reference dataset with 15 000 tiles (256×256 pixels) sampled from high-resolution (≤1 m) imagery. However, this dataset uses weak labels generated by a model rather than manual labeling, making it less suitable for validation.\n\nTo thoroughly evaluate a product's effectiveness and robustness, multiple independent assessments are needed since high accuracy on one dataset does not guarantee similar performance on others. No single dataset can fully represent the real world (Paullada et al., 2021), and manual labels inevitably contain some subjectivity (Misra et al., 2016). Independent evaluations also help mitigate the issue of data leakage, where the validation set is improperly used during model training, leading to overfitting (Vandewiele et al., 2021). Multiple independent validation datasets are therefore essential for comprehensively evaluating and building trust in remote sensing-based surface water products and methods.\n\nIn this study, we present a high-quality, globally sampled, high-resolution surface water dataset consisting of 100 hand-labeled 1024×1024 pixel PlanetScope images at 3 m resolution. Our work builds upon existing satellite-based datasets for validating surface water extent. The motivation is to provide a higher-resolution hand-labeled dataset for evaluating surface water products derived from medium-resolution public satellites like Landsat and Sentinel and commercial higher-resolution PlanetScope imagery. Our dataset addresses some of the limitations of existing datasets by providing pixel-level water labels at a higher resolution (3 m) compared to some other datasets and encompassing diverse biomes and contexts (urban/rural, mountains/plains, rivers/lakes) for comprehensive evaluations. We evaluate two state-of-the-art surface water extent mapping methods using our dataset: the Dynamic World land use and land cover product based on optical Sentinel-2 imagery and the NASA IMPACT inundation mapping model based on radar Sentinel-1 data, which was the winning solution in a recent flood detection challenge. By applying our validation dataset to these products and methods, we aim to better understand their advantages and limitations. We anticipate our dataset will contribute to improved accuracy assessment, spatial generalizability analysis, and robustness evaluation of existing surface water products and methods. These advancements can ultimately benefit societies by promoting more effective monitoring and management of water resources, especially in the face of climate change and population growth.\n\n2.1 Sampling\n\nOur objective was to build a dataset that closely represents the true distribution of surface water features using only 100 samples. A representative dataset enables testing the spatial generalizability and accuracy of surface water extent products. However, achieving a true representation is nearly impossible (Paullada et al., 2021). We approached this challenge by sampling from different biomes, as defined by Olson et al. (2001), which encompass various climates and land conditions, giving a better chance of providing high variance within samples.\n\nWe employed a stratified random sampling strategy to ensure the representativeness of our dataset. First, we created a 2 km buffer around global river and lake shapefiles provided by the World Wildlife Fund (2005) using QGIS (Quantum GIS). We then clipped these buffers with the shapefiles of each of the 14 biomes. Within each biome, we randomly placed 50 points using QGIS's random point generator and selected at least 5 of them as samples.\n\nTo address the various contexts in which surface water exists, we randomly selected additional samples from urbanized regions (Patterson and Kelso, 2012), braided rivers, and coastal regions. Urban areas are spatially heterogeneous, often resulting in increased complexity for water detection. We also separately sampled from lakes and rivers to ensure a balanced representation of both water body types. Braided rivers and coastal areas were included.\n\nFigure 1 shows the number of samples for each biome, while Fig. 2 illustrates the global spatial distribution of the samples. The numbers of samples from “Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests” and “Tropical and Subtropical Coniferous Forests” were limited due to their smaller areal coverage. Approximately two-thirds of our labels are from rivers and the remaining one-third are from lakes. We sampled a larger portion from “Deserts and Xeric Shrublands” (16 samples) because water extraction methods generally perform worse in these regions, especially when using radar imagery (Martinis, 2017).\n\nThe temporal distribution of our samples spans from 2021 to 2023, covering different seasons to capture seasonal variations in surface water extent. While our sampling strategy aimed to maximize representativeness within the constraints of labeling resources, we acknowledge that the limited number of samples (100) may not fully capture all global surface water variations.\n\nDuring the sampling process, we implemented quality control measures to ensure that the selected locations were suitable for labeling and analysis. We downloaded the PlanetScope scene for each location, divided the scene into 1024×1024 sized images, and then selected the image that contained sufficient water and no cloud cover.\n\n2.2 Data processing\n\nAfter selecting 100 locations based on our sampling strategy, we downloaded 8-band, 3 m resolution SuperDove PlanetScope (PS) imagery from 2021 to 2023 using our access to the NASA Commercial SmallSat Data Acquisition (CSDA) program. As our objective was to evaluate most medium-resolution satellite sensors, including Sentinel-1 (S1), we ensured that the failure of the Sentinel-1B satellite, on 23 December 2021, did not create a large temporal gap between the label and the last available scene from the satellite. For locations only covered by Sentinel-1B and not Sentinel-1A, we acquired PS scenes before the Sentinel-1B failure date.\n\nDuring the scene selection process, we excluded areas with perennially frozen water. If a location contained seasonal ice, we replaced that PS image with a summer image when the water was not frozen. This approach ensured that our dataset focused on liquid water surfaces, which are more relevant for surface water extent mapping.\n\nFrom each larger PS scene, we extracted a 1024×1024 pixel image, covering an area of approximately 9.4 km2. We chose 1024×1024 pixel images to ensure sufficient pixels and spatial context for comparison with medium-resolution imagery (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel). For instance, a 30 m Landsat image corresponding to our labels would have around 100×100 pixels, while a 10 m Sentinel image would have approximately 376×376 pixels. Figure 3 showcases two examples of the PS images selected for labeling, displayed in false-color composite (near-infrared, red, and green bands).\n\n2.3 Data labeling\n\nWe used high-resolution 3 m PlanetScope (PS) data for labeling, ideal for the evaluation of lower-resolution satellite products such as Sentinel-1 (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2) at 10 m, or Landsat sensors at 30 m.\n\nThe labeling was performed by experienced analysts to distinguish between three classes: water, low-confidence water, and non-water. The water class represents areas with a clear presence of water, while the low-confidence water class marks pixels where the presence of water is uncertain but probable. The non-water class encompasses all other land cover types. To assist the labelers, we provided true-color composite (TCC) and false-color composite (FCC) images using the near-infrared, red, and green bands for each sample.\n\nIn cases where the presence of water was unclear in the PS imagery, we cross-referenced them with higher-resolution basemaps from Bing and Google. Unresolved features were assigned to the low-confidence water category, ensuring that the water class only includes pixels with a high degree of certainty. During the evaluation process, the low-confidence water class can be excluded or added to the water category as necessary.\n\nTo streamline the labeling process and ensure the creation of high-quality labels, we utilized the Labelbox platform (Labelbox, 2024), which provides efficient tools for data annotation. After the initial labeling, we performed several rounds of quality checks on each label to maintain accuracy and consistency across the dataset.\n\nIn total, we labeled 100 images, each with a size of 1024×1024 pixels, covering a total surface area of 940 km2. The labeling process, including quality control, took approximately 2 h per image, resulting in a total of 200 h of work. The labeled surface water accounts for nearly 250 km2 of the total area. Each label is assigned a unique sample ID (SID) ranging from 1 to 100 and includes the date (YYYYMMDD) of the PS image used for labeling.\n\n2.4 Dataset analysis\n\nWe labeled a total of one-hundred 1024×1024 PS images at 3 m, with the overall class distribution covering 24.9 % of the total surface area, low-confidence water covering 1.2 %, and the rest (73.9 %) being non-water (Fig. 5). The distribution of water pixel percentages for each individual label, as displayed in Fig. 6, demonstrates that most labels contain less than 50 % water pixels by design, with the mean water surface area per label being 26.10 km2. This focus on having more non-water area enables better delineation of water boundaries, as the water class itself tends to be more homogeneous and therefore less complex from both labeling and mapping perspectives.\n\nAs mentioned previously, our labeled dataset covers water surface areas across different biomes (Table 1). The mean percentage of water content per label varies substantially between biomes, from a low of 5.29 % for “Mediterranean Forests, Woodlands and Scrub” to a high of 42.95 % for “Temperate Grasslands, Savannas and Shrublands”. This demonstrates the diversity of landscapes and water coverage captured in our dataset. In total, our dataset provides 2609.78 km2 of labeled water surface area, covering a variety of landscapes such as rivers passing through urban regions, braided rivers in deltas, rivers passing through forests and agricultural fields, and waterbodies in plain and mountainous regions. The diversity and representativeness of our dataset make it a valuable resource for testing the limits and robustness of satellite data products and mapping methods.\n\n2.5 Dataset structure\n\nAll 100 labels are in the GeoTIFF format with the UInt8 data type and a single band. Each pixel can contain four possible values: 0 (no data), 1 (non-water), 2 (low-confidence water), and 3 (water). The labels are in the WGS84 (EPSG:4326) coordinate reference system. Each label has a corresponding PlanetScope image used for labeling in Labelbox. The PlanetScope images are also in the WGS84 (EPSG:4326) coordinate reference system and contain three spectral bands (red, green, and blue) in true-color composite. Based on our PS image release agreement with Planet, we converted the original surface reflectance values to byte format with possible pixel values between 0 and 255, instead of UInt16.\n\nThe label files are named using the following convention: SIDX_YYYYMMDD.tif, where “SIDX” is the unique sample ID (with X ranging from 1 to 100) and “YYYYMMDD” represents the date of the PlanetScope image used for labeling. The corresponding PlanetScope images follow the naming convention: SIDX_PSID.tif, where SIDX is the same as the label, but PSID is the original SuperDove PlanetScope image ID, allowing for the retrieval of the original surface reflectance values, provided there is access.\n\nOur dataset is organized using the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) format, which is a standardized way to describe and catalog geospatial data. The STAC format provides a clear and consistent structure for storing and accessing the labels and their corresponding PlanetScope images, along with relevant metadata.\n\nWe evaluated two surface water mapping methods based on an optical and a radar satellite imagery product to demonstrate the use of our validation dataset. We used standard metrics for classification – precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, intersection over union (IoU), and accuracy for evaluating the two surface water maps. We measured their performance across each biome and their overall performance.\n\n3.1 Performance of Sentinel-2-based Dynamic World on detecting surface water\n\nDynamic World (DW) is a land use land cover product from Google that utilizes a deep learning model trained on their own labeled dataset. The product includes nine classes, including water, and produces a map for every Sentinel-2 image. Each Sentinel-2 image is post-processed and with clouds removed. We downloaded Sentinel-2 images within 3 d of each of the 100 labeled PlanetScope images. We also applied a not-a-number (NaN) filter, ensuring that images with at least 90 % valid pixels are considered. After applying the temporal and NaN filters, there were 53 corresponding Sentinel-2-based DW maps out of our 100 labels. From each DW map, we extracted the first band, which contains the water class. Each DW class contains continuous values between 0 and 1, where 1 denotes the highest confidence in the model prediction. We converted the continuous values to binary, thresholding at 0.3. The water class is one of the least confused classes in the DW product, so mixed pixels are less likely. Finally, we evaluated DW on our labels. Note that for evaluation we converted the low-confidence water class to water. We finally resampled the DW water class to match the resolution of the labels at 3 m using nearest-neighbor interpolation before evaluating. Note that for evaluation we merged the low-confidence water class with water. Therefore, labels were either 0 (non-water) or 1 (water).\n\nFigure 7 illustrates the performance of the water class in the Dynamic World product across different biomes using IoU. IoU provides an assessment of the overlap between the predicted and ground truth water pixels, with higher values indicating better performance. The number of samples per biome varies, with some biomes having more representative data than others. For biomes with a larger number of samples, such as “Deserts and Xeric Shrublands” and “Boreal Forests and Taiga”, the IoU scores provide a more robust evaluation of the DW water class performance. Despite the variations in sample size, notable differences in performance can be observed among the biomes. It is important to note that the IoU metric is influenced by the amount of water present in each label. Higher water percentage often leads to higher IoU. However, our dataset has an average of 26.1 % surface water pixels, providing a balanced assessment of the DW water class performance.\n\nFigure 8 provides a visual comparison of the Dynamic World water class predictions with the labels for two locations: Sundarban National Park, Bangladesh (SID01), and Shandong, China (SID13). The DW product appears to capture the majority of the water pixels accurately; however, it misses the narrow rivers (SID01) and it incorrectly ignores two bridges (SID13).\n\nTable 2 summarizes the performance metrics for the Dynamic World water class evaluated on our hand-labeled dataset. The mean precision of 0.8812 indicates that, on average, 88.12 % of the pixels predicted as water by DW are actually water in our ground truth labels. The mean sensitivity (recall) of 0.7745 suggests that DW correctly identifies 77.45 % of the water pixels in our labels. The high mean specificity (0.9656) indicates that DW accurately classifies non-water pixels, with minimal misclassification as water. The F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, has a mean value of 0.7970, indicating a good balance between the two metrics. The mean IoU of 0.7216 signifies that, on average, there is a 72.16 % overlap between the predicted and ground truth water pixels. Lastly, the mean accuracy of 0.9529 shows that DW correctly classifies 95.29 % of the pixels overall, including non-water pixels. However, the high standard deviation indicates that there is a large variability in performance for almost all metrics except specificity and accuracy, since they take into account the non-water pixels.\n\n3.2 Performance of the Sentinel-1-based deep learning model\n\nWe evaluated the performance of a deep learning model (Paul and Ganju, 2021) for inundation mapping that uses S1 radar imagery. This deep learning model was the competition winner at the NASA IMPACT challenge for flood detection. Unlike Dynamic World, which contained a surface water class, this method focuses on flood or more specifically inundation class. Technically, our hand-labeled dataset also labels inundation, although our labels did not focus on capturing flooding. Therefore, we are not directly comparing the S1 IMPACT flood model against the Dynamic World water class.\n\nWe processed radiometrically corrected S1 imagery from Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF)'s data repository using the Hyp3 API (application programming interface). S1 imagery was searched for each label 3 d before and after the labeled date. We clipped the S1 scenes based on the labels, and then we applied the trained model to these clipped S1 scenes using the trained model. We then evaluated the predictions from the deep learning model on our labels after resampling the imagery to match the resolution of the higher-resolution labels using nearest-neighbor interpolation. Thus, 72 S1 images were selected for this evaluation. Note that for evaluation we converted the low-confidence water class to water. Therefore, labels were either 0 (non-water) or 1 (water).\n\nFigure 9 illustrates the performance of the S1-based deep learning model across different biomes using the intersection over union (IoU) metric. Performance across biomes has a large variation, with some notable differences. For example, the IMPACT model performed robustly on “Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests”, “Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests”, “Tundra”, and “Mangroves”. Although for “Tropical and Subtropical Coniferous Forests”, “Temperate Coniferous Forests”, and “Deserts and Xeric Shrublands”, the model performed less accurately and with large variations; this was especially true for “Mediterranean Forests, Woodlands and Scrub” where the model consistently performed poorly. The effectiveness is influenced by the fact that the training dataset of this model is focused on only five flood events globally. Therefore, performing accurately on the global surface water dataset is not the objective of this model. Nonetheless, the objective is still detection inundation, and the variation in performance provides clues to how such a model can be improved by sampling from biomes or other contexts (urban, river, lake, etc.).\n\nFigure 10 provides a visual comparison of the Sentinel-1-based deep learning model's predictions with the ground truth labels for two locations: Nam Định, Vietnam (SID33), and Paymaster Landing, California, USA (SID59). The model appears to capture the majority of the water pixels accurately. However, the labels and the corresponding prediction by the S1-based model demonstrates the complexity of labeling and identifying water in a meandering braided river (SID33). In the case of SID59, the S1 model performs well, except for the coarser edges of a river in a more arid landscape.\n\nTable 3 summarizes the performance metrics for the S1-based deep learning model evaluated on our hand-labeled dataset. The metrics exhibit significant variability across the evaluated labels. The S1 IMPACT model generally found it difficult to predict water pixels across several biomes. Apart from the differences in resolution, turbulent water and water located in spatially heterogeneous landscapes are more complicated to detect. Given the cloud-free observations, S1-based models can be of considerable benefit for regular monitoring and consistent observations.\n\nAlthough our hand-labeled dataset provides a valuable resource for evaluating surface water extent products, it has several limitations that must be considered. First, the spatial resolution of the dataset is limited to 3 m, making it more suitable for evaluating lower-spatial-resolution imagery (> 3 m). For higher resolutions (≤3 m), the influence of human labeling errors on the evaluation results is likely to increase. Despite our efforts to cross-reference multiple sources of higher resolution (<1 m Bing and Google basemaps) during our labeling process and implement considerable quality control, the dataset unavoidably contains biases from our labelers, in addition to the biases in the optical PS imagery itself. A model using PS will likely perform the best since PS was the primary source for labeling. Moreover, some features remained unresolved, especially features finer than 3 m, leading to the addition of another class called “low-confidence water”.\n\nWhile we made an effort to include samples from diverse contexts in which water can be found (urban, lakes, braided rivers, mountainous regions) and multiple biomes covering different seasons, designing a truly representative dataset is not feasible. The stratified random sampling strategy used to create the dataset aims to cover diverse contexts and biomes but may not capture all the variability in surface water appearance across different regions and seasons. Additionally, the dataset only represents a snapshot in time and does not account for temporal changes in surface water extent, which can be significant in some regions due to seasonal variations, human interventions, or flooding. For example, this dataset does not include frozen water bodies.\n\nTherefore, we recommend using evaluations from multiple independent datasets from various sources to achieve further robustness in evaluation. While our dataset is primarily designed for validation purposes, it can still be used for fine-tuning pretrained models. However, it does not include the original input PlanetScope images of our labels, which are required for training models. This ensures that there is no data leak from the training process, maintaining the integrity of the evaluation process. Nevertheless, relying on a single dataset for evaluation has its limitations, and using multiple independent datasets is crucial for assessing the robustness and generalizability of surface water mapping methods.\n\nAcharki, S.: PlanetScope contributions compared to Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 for LULC mapping, Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment, 27, 100774, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2022.100774, 2022. a\n\nAlemohammad, H. and Booth, K.: LandCoverNet: A global benchmark land cover classification training dataset, arXiv [preprint], arXiv:2012.03111, 2020. a\n\nBamber, J. and Bindschadler, R.: An improved elevation dataset for climate and ice-sheet modelling: validation with satellite imagery, Ann.

      "# [30 best data labeling tools [2024 Q3 Updated]](https://www.superannotate.com/blog/best-data-labeling-tools)\nMachine Learning (ML) is becoming increasingly popular and is being adopted in real-life AI applications across different industries. Creating a real-world AI application often requires extensive work with unstructured data. In fact, ML engineers and data scientists spend more than 80% of their time on data preparation and labeling and only a fraction of their time on the so-called fun stuff: reading research papers, training models, trying new architectures, tuning hyperparameters, deploying, monitoring, etc.\n\nSince ML engineers are spending such a huge portion of their time on structuring, labeling, versioning, and debugging datasets to become AI-ready training data (aka SuperData), data labeling toolsets have become essential for building scalable AI applications. However, data labeling tools or simple data labeling editors are far away from covering all the growing needs of anyone's complex ML pipeline.\n\n‍\n\nWe identified 6 essential components that make data labeling tools a compelling solution for building modern AI pipelines. Namely, annotation software, AI data management and curation, integrations and security, project and quality management, and automation.\n\n‍\n\nTherefore, this article is neither about simple data labeling tools using open-source software such as label studio, cvat, labelme, nor is it about specific functionalities within labeling editors such as bounding boxes, polygons, text labeling, etc.\n\n‍\n\nWe will cover various types of data labeling companies, along with their history and functionalities, detailed feature sets, additional AI pipeline-oriented components, and much more. We will rely on one of the most reliable software ranking marketplaces, G2, where data labeling is a separate software category within various AI software. As we indicated above, for each company/solution, we will cover the following:\n\nAnnotation software (image annotation, video annotation, text annotation, etc.)\n\nAI Data Management and curation (active learning, query system, smart sampling, subset selection, data versioning, etc.)\n\nIntegrations and security (Storage integrations, model inference API or model training integrations, etc.)\n\nMLOps and Automation (SDK, webhooks, orchestrations, AI-enabled labeling, model management, etc.)\n\nProject and quality management (Team/role management, annotation project management, and performance tracking)\n\nIntegrated annotation services\n\nWe will be updating this article quarterly and tracking all the position changes, feature releases, large news, and announcements.\n\n1. SuperAnnotate\n\nRanked as the best data labeling platform in G2, SuperAnnotate builds an end-to-end data solution with an integrated service marketplace, where they help their customers to find the right annotation team within the preferred geographic location and proficiency. The labeling teams are directly integrated into SuperAnnotate's platform and managed by their professional project managers which is reported to be one of their key strengths. The company also provides data on its platform with various labeling tools without annotation services.\n\n‍Company history: Started as a Ph.D. research, SuperAnnotate was founded in 2018, primarily as an image annotation tool for semantic segmentation, but quickly gained momentum and extended into other areas of ML pipeline development. SuperAnnotate raised about $22M from investors such as P9 and Base10.\n\n‍Key features: The software itself focuses on 5 key components of the AI lifecycle:\n\nData labeling tools and efficient project management\n\nAI dataset management, data curation, and version control\n\nAI model management, model comparison, and versioning\n\nAutomation and orchestration via various triggering systems (available for enterprises)\n\nAnnotation Service Marketplace\n\nData labeling tools: On the labeling side, the company started with image annotation capabilities. Over the last 2 years, SuperAnnotate launched the video and text annotation editors. Fasting forward, they introduced more targeted labeling data formats, such as audio labeling, native PDF, DICOM, etc. 2023 and 2024 were remarkable for SuperAnnotate's LLM fine-tuning tool.\n\nLLMs: SuperAnnotate helps companies build top-notch training data for fine-tuning their language models. Its fully customizable interface allows you to gather fine-tuning data for your specific use case efficiently. Even if it's unique.\n\n‍MLOps: While covering different data formats, it is also important to cover other MLOps capabilities, which makes such annotation tooling companies more compelling within the entire AI lifecycle. On that end, SuperAnnotate’s capabilities become very attractive for any startup or enterprise users. More particularly, easy project management, data curation, data versioning, model management, automation, and complete SDK allow customers to automate incredibly complex AI pipelines (as reviews confirm).\n\n‍Security: SuperAnnotate also offers multiple levels of data security, allowing users to store their datasets on their premises or in SuperAnnotate’s encrypted S3 buckets. The company owns several certifications, including SOC2 Type II on the software side and ISO 27001, GDPR, and HIPPA compliance.\n\nAnnotation Services: On the services side, SuperAnnotate vetted over 400 annotation service teams and allows its users to find teams in different geographies, languages, and medical experts, as well as relatively cost-efficient annotation services for easier tasks such as image classification. For LLM projects, SuperAnnotate has expert data trainers worldwide who help build best-in-class fine-tuning and LLM evaluation datasets.\n\nG2 review summary: SuperAnnotate holds 19 G2 badges across 3 categories for summer 2024, leading the data labeling category in EMEA with high performance both on MLOps and image recognition.\n\nSuperAnnotate is 1 easiest to use data labeling software, continues to carry the Best Support, leader, most implementable, the Best Relationship builder, and the Best to do business with.\n\nOut of the 137 reviews (4.9/5), most users believe that SuperAnnotate’s platform is super-user-friendly, efficient and contains all the features required for annotating unstructured data.\n\nMany praise the platform's data management and ability to track the progress of annotation tasks across different projects while leveraging useful metrics. They say it's easy to roll back and make changes while annotating. Users also assure they do not experience major problems with the tool at all. When faced with minor issues, the support service is always there to assist in a timely manner. They claim that the product team is always open to suggestions and is highly interested in client feedback. There is a mention of how the upload and export of pipelines are a bit burdensome when just starting, yet the user also adds that SuperAnnotate is always adding useful functionality to reduce these issues.\n\nUsers are particularly concerned about data security and claim it is one of the main reasons they chose SuperAnnotate over other platforms.\n\n‍Pricing: The software is FREE for up to 3 users and 5.000 data items. For higher-level commitments, make sure to consult with the sales department.\n\n2.
