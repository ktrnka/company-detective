The winning variation will then receive 100% of traffic.\n\nBandits seek to balance the \"explore\"/\"exploit\" problem - balancing between \"exploiting\" the current best known solution versus \"exploring\" to get more information about other solutions.\n\nOur blog posts on Multi-Armed Bandits and Contextual Bandits go into depth on use cases and considerations.\n\nA/B/n TestMulti-Armed Bandit (Autotune)Contextual Bandit (Autotune AI)Ranking EngineTypical # Variants2-34-84-8Arbitrary #Personalization FactorNoneNoneModerateHighInput Data RequiredNoneVery Little (100+ samples)Little - generally 1000+ samplesTens of thousands to millions of samplesModel EfficacyNoneBasicModerateHighIdentifies Best VariantYesYesNoNoConsistent User AssignmentYesNoNoNo\n\nImplementing an Autotune is as simple as checking an experiment in Statsig. After initialization, or on server SDKs, this comes with sub-millisecond latency.\n\nAutotune will have a JSON config associated with each variant, which will be returned by the SDK and can be used to modify elements of your webpage (e.g. an image URL or button color), or simply identify the variant so that you know which code to use.\n\nAutotune has two major differences from A/B testing (Statsig Experiments):\n\nThe traffic split isn't fixed over the duration of the test. This allows Autotune to divert more traffic to the winner, fewer from the losers while making fewer mistakes. However, this means the user experience may not be consistent upon repeated visits.\n\nAutotune can only optimize for a single metric. Autotune can't accurately measure a collection of metrics, and isn't a great way to understand secondary effects of your changes. Because of this, it works best when the metric is well-understood, has a direct and immediate relationship to the change being tested\n\nBecause of these differences, Statsig recommends Autotune in the following scenarios:\n\nThe cost of exposing users to a losing treatment is high. For example, sending new users to a landing page that is inferior may result in lost revenue or churn. While this may be a one-time loss, testing two user registration flows may result in users that never sign up. In this case, Autotune avoids permanently losing users since it can quickly adapt to feedback unlike a static A/B test.\n\nYou want the decision to be automated. Because Autotune automatically selects the winner, it requires no human decision-making. This is great for launching dozens of simultaneous tests, or for running a long-term unmonitored test.\n\nWhen it's okay for users to be exposed to different experiences upon return visits. For example, changing text or recommendation algorithms.\n\nWhen you have one simple metric to optimize for (eg. click-through rate) that has is an immediate effect of the test.\n\nWhen you want to test multiple variations. Autotune can quickly rules out really poor performers while focusing traffic on the best variants.\n\nAutotune should be avoided in the following scenarios:\n\nWhen you have a complex ecosystem and want to understand secondary effects, tradeoffs between variants, and user behavior.\n\nWhen you are optimizing for complex metrics or delayed effects.",
      "# [Statsig Docs on 2025-02-13](https://www.statsig.com/faq)\nFAQ\n\nBucketing in Statsig is deterministic. Given the same user object and the same state of the experiment or feature gate, Statsig always returns the same result, even when evaluated on different platforms (client or server). Here's how it works:\n\nSalt Creation: Each experiment or feature gate rule generates a unique salt.\n\nHashing: The user identifier (e.g., userId, organizationId) is passed through a SHA256 hashing function, combined with the salt, which produces a large integer.\n\nBucket Assignment: The large integer is then subjected to a modulus operation with 10000 (or 1000 for layers), assigning the user to a bucket.\n\nBucket Determination: The result defines the specific bucket out of 10000 (or 1000 for layers) where the user is placed.\n\nThis process ensures a randomized but deterministic bucketing of users across different experiments or feature gates. The unique salt per-experiment or feature gate rule ensures that the same user can be assigned to different buckets in different experiments. This also means that if you rollout a feature gate rule to 50% - then back to 0% - then back to 50%, the same 50% of users will be re-exposed, so long as you reuse the same rule - and not create a new one. See here.\n\nA lot of times people assume that we keep track of a list of all ids and what group they were assigned to for experiments, or which IDs passed a certain feature gate. While our data pipelines keep track of which users were exposed to which experiment variant in order to generate experiment results, we do not cache previous evaluations and maintain distributed evaluation state across client and server sdks. That model doesn't scale - we've even talked to customers who were using an implementation like that in the past, and were paying more for a Redis instance to maintain that state than they ended up paying to use Statsig instead.\n\nFor more details, check our open-source SDKs here.\n\nThis is not generally recommended, but for advanced use cases - e.g. a series of related experiments that needs to reuse the control and test buckets, we now expose the ability to copy and set the salts used for deterministic hashing. This is meant to be used with care and is only available to Project Administrators. It is available in the Overflow (...) menu in Experiments.\n\nNo. Once an experiment is started, you cannot change the layer. This restriction ensures the integrity of the experiment. We may support this feature in the future.\n\nNo. We've intentionally decided to not allow any Statsig config (Feature Gate, Experiment, Layer, etc.) to be renamed - as renaming a config that is already integrated in your code can have serious undesirable consequences. The exception to this is Metrics, which have display names not used in code.\n\nDefining parameters for experiments provides flexibility and speed in iteration. Many companies, such as Facebook, Uber, and Airbnb, follow this approach in their experimentation platforms because it allows:\n\nFaster iteration (no code changes required for new experiments).\n\nMore flexible experiment designs.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn the first case, adding a new color (e.g., \"Green\") requires a code change. In the second case, you can modify the experiment configuration without making a code change.\n\nIn short-lived processes (e.g., scripts or edge workers), the process may exit before the event queue flushes to Statsig. To ensure that exposures and events are logged, call statsig.flush() before the process exits.\n\nFor details on flushing, check the Node.js Server SDK documentation.\n\nIf none of our current SDKs meet your needs, please let us know via our Slack community!\n\nIf you're interested in historical exposures, the console's users tab may serve your needs.\n\nIf you need all hypothetical assignments, you can consider using the getClientInitializeResponse server sdk method. Statsig's SDKs should ideally be invoked at the time you're serving an experiment treatment, so that an exposure can be logged. If that's not possible in your case (perhaps you need to pass assignment information to other applications, or to use assignment information as cache-keys for the CDN + edge), this approach could work.\n\nNote, this method is designed to bootstrap client SDKs, and as such, will hash the experiment and feature keys returned in the payload, obfuscating their names for security. You can provide an optional hash parameter, allowing you to disable hashing and capture all values in plain text: Node, Python, Java, Go.\n\nYou'll receive default values - false for feature flags, and the in-code defaults for experiments or layer parameters. You should expect to see \"Unrecognized\" evaluation reasons - see our Debugging Section. This behavior will be the same on a non-existent config vs. one that is deleted, one that is archived, or one that your current SDK instance can't see because of target apps.\n\nYes. If you increase the rollout percentage (e.g., from 10% to 20%), the original 10% will continue to pass, while an additional 10% will start passing. Reducing the percentage will restore the original 10%. The same behavior exists if you reduce then re-increase the pass percentage. To reshuffle users, you'll need to \"resalt\" the gate.\n\nThis is only true of the same \"rule\" per gate, if you create a new rule with the same pass percentage as another one, it will pass a different set of users.\n\nNote - today, increasing the allocation percentage of an experiment is not guaranteed to behave the same as the above - if you'd like to have dependably deterministic allocations, we recommend using targeting gates.\n\nStatsig uses a two-sample Z test for most experiments and Welch’s t-test for smaller sample sizes. These methods are industry-standard and have been validated through simulations and research.\n\nFor small samples, we use Welch's t-test, which is more suitable for unequal group sizes or variances. We also support CUPED and winsorization to increase test power.\n\nUse a one-sided test if you're confident that you're only interested in movement in a specific direction. This increases the power of the test but sacrifices insight into secondary metrics.\n\nIf your feature isn't live yet, you can start an A/B test using a feature flag. If it's already in production, you can create an experiment. Results can be viewed in the Pulse Results tab.\n\nYes, you can. When setting up your experiment, select a Feature Flag with targeting rules. In this case, only iOS users would pass the gate.\n\nBillable events occur when the Statsig SDK checks if a user is exposed to a feature flag or experiment or logs an event. Pre-computed metrics from data warehouses and custom metrics created from existing data also count as billable.\n\nDownload a CSV from the Usage and Billing tab to review events contributing to your volume.\n\nCreate a pivot table in Excel to identify the top event volume drivers.\n\nAdmins receive proactive alerts at 25/50/75/100% of their contracted events.\n\nPro subscriptions are limited to one project each. You can create more projects within Statsig, but if you want to have access to pro features and 5M events, you will need to upgrade each project independently. You can read more about our Pro plans here.\n\nEnterprise plans can support multiple projects. If you might be interest in this, contact us here!\n\nProjects have distinct boundaries. If you're using the same userIDs and metrics across surfaces, apps or environments, put them in the same project. Create a new project when you're managing a separate product with unique user IDs and metrics.\n\nFor example, if you have a marketing website (anonymous users) and a product (signed-in users), you may want to separate them. However, if you want to track success across both you should manage them in the same project. (e.g. from user signup on the marketing website to user engagement within the product)\n\nSome reasons to NOT create a new project",

      "# [Power Calculator](https://www.statsig.com/powercalculator)\nHaving enough power in your A/B test requires a large enough sample size.\n\nPower is the probability that a test correctly rejects a false null hypothesis - i.e., ensuring an A/B tests is sensitive enough to detect a true effect when there is one. To calculate the sample we need for a certain power, we need several inputs - including baseline conversion rate, minimum detectable effect, A/B split ratio, significance and power.\n\nHow to use this calculator:\n\nDetermine your baseline conversion rate\n\nThis is the current conversion rate of your control group. In an A/B test, the baseline conversion is the expected rate of conversion (or other desireable outcome) in the control group, or those not being exposed to a new experience.\n\nChoose a minimum detectable effect\n\nThis is the smallest difference that can be consistently detected in an experiment. In an A/B test, this is the minimum change in desireable outcome you’d want to be able to detect.\n\nInput your values\n\nThe output sample size of the calculator will be the minimum viable amount to consistently achieve statistically significant results, based on the power level that you choose. Choosing a higher power means a lower frequency of false negatives, but will also require a commensurate number more samples.\n\nThe calculator is automatically set to optimal defaults, but you can adjust the advanced settings to see how they impact your results.\n\nHypothesis\n\nIf you are looking to determine if a single test variation is better than a control, use a one-sided test (recommended). If you want to determine if its different from the control, then use a two-sided test.\n\nA/B split ratio\n\nMost A/B tests are conducted with a 50%/50% split across test and control users (represented as an input of 0.5 in this calculator), but this can be tuned to your own experimental design.\n\nSignificance (α)\n\nAlpha is the probability that a statistically significant difference is detected when one does not exist. 0.05 is a common default for Alpha, but you can choose a higher or lower value to adjust the probability that an observed difference isn’t due to chance, but requires a larger sample size.\n\nStatistical Power (1 - β)",
      "# [Statsig Docs on 2025-03-19](https://docs.statsig.com/holdouts/)\nHoldouts\n\nHoldouts measure the aggregate impact of multiple features. It involves a \"holdout\" group of users that are held back from a set of features for measurement. While each A/B test or experiment you run compares control and test groups for that feature, a holdout compares the \"holdout\" group (Control) against users who have been exposed to multiple features and experiments.\n\nTo create a new holdout, navigate to the Holdouts section on the Statsig console (it is a specialized kind of experiment): https://console.statsig.com/holdouts\n\nClick the Create New button and enter the name, description and unit type of the holdout that you want to create.\n\nYou can choose to either create a global or a selected holdout. A global holdout is automatically added to any new feature with the same unit type, and is meant to capture the aggregate impact of all features developed after the holdout began (individual features may be opted out as needed). A selected holdout captures the aggregate impact of a specific selection of features that you want to hold off.\n\nBy default Holdouts apply to a % of all users (Population = Everyone). You can optionally target the Holdout at a subset of users by applying a Targeting Gate (Population = Targeting Gate). e.g. If you wanted an iOS users only Holdout, you could apply a Targeting Gate that only passes iOS users.\n\nYou must set the percentage of users to be held-out between 1% to 10%. Statsig recommends a small holdout percentage to limit the number of customers who don’t see new features.\n\nHoldouts on Statsig use the same \"equal variant\" methodology as Feature Gate rollouts, whereby metric lifts are computed by equal sized groups to calculate holdout lift. You can read more about the advantages of this methodology in \"A/B Testing Intuition Busters: Common Misunderstandings in Online Controlled Experiments” by Ron Kohavi, Alex Deng, & Lukas Vermeer.\n\nAccordingly, the Cumulative Exposures panel for a given Holdout shows total exposures of the Holdout, broken down into three groups-\n\n(1) Units that were included in the Holdout, and were used for analysis\n\nUnits that were not included in the Holdout, and were used for analysis vs. the holdout group\n\nUnits that were not included in the Holdout, and were not used for analysis\n\nFor users not in the Holdout, we generate two groups (used for analysis and not used for analysis). This is a randomly chosen group that is meant to balance the comparison.\n\nHoldout metric lifts represent the cumulative impact of launched and active experiments on the Holdout group vs. the same % of the rest of the population who were subject to the included rollouts and experiments.\n\nIn the example below, the 1% Holdout is comparing the metric values of the 1% Holdout vs. 1% of the rest of the population. The launched features are having an overall negative effect on the \"Add to Cart\" metric.\n\nSize - Statsig recommends a small holdout percentage, say 1% – 2%, to limit the number of customers who don’t see new features.\n\nDuration - Statsig recommends operating holdouts for a period of three to six months, and then releasing the holdout. Prolonging the holdout period may increase the complexity of your software as you’d have to maintain a functioning product with no new features for a longer period.\n\nBack testing - Occasionally you may want to turn off a set of features that you have already released to measure the effectiveness of those features. Statsig doesn’t recommend this as it turns off features that users are already using and relying on. However, when a \"back measurement\" is critical, you can use Holdouts to turn off a set of features and automatically compute the impact of this set of features.\n\nBy default, holdouts are based on User ID. To use a different ID type, select it from the drop down menu during the holdout creation. Note that holdouts can only be applied to Experiments and Feature Gates that use the same randomization unit. If a team plans to run experiments on both User ID and Stable ID, two separate holdouts are required to evaluate the cumulative impact of each type of experiment.\n\nFor users in holdout, gates will always return False.\n\nFor users in holdout, if the experiment is not in a Layer, calls to get experiment parameters will always return the \"default value\" passed in code.\n\nFor users in holdout, if the experiment is in a Layer, calls to get experiment parameters will return the values defined in the Layer defaults in the Statsig console.",

      "# [The modern product development platform](https://www.statsig.com/pricing)\nHow do I get started with Statsig?\n\nWhen you first sign up for Statsig, you automatically start on Statsig’s Developer Tier, which gives you free access to gates, configs, experimentation and analytics. On this plan, you get 2 million Metered Events (see definition below) every calendar month at no charge.\n\nIf you need more features or additional Metered Events, you can upgrade to our Pro or Enterprise tiers at any time. If you are using Statsig at scale, you can take advantage of the volume discounts offered as a part of Statsig’s Enterprise Tier.\n\nWhat is Statsig’s pricing philosophy?\n\nAt Statsig, our pricing philosophy is to charge for features that 1) cost us money and 2) create value for our customers. Accordingly, we’ve chosen a usage-based pricing model, where users are charged for the events and exposures their applications sends to Statsig.\n\nA good example of this pricing philosophy is how Statsig charges for Feature Flags. We provide users with the ability to toggle the calculation for Metric Lifts associated with their rollout on or off. By default we don’t charge customers for any exposures associated with 0 or 100% roll-outs. We would only charge a customer when they’ve togggled Metric Lifts on and when the gate is a partial roll-out (meaning there are valid Metric Lift computations).\n\nWhat are metered events?\n\nStatsig bills customers based on the number of Metered Events they use. Metered Events are a subset of events which power analytics or metrics workflows. These workflows are compute & storage intensive.\n\nThe following types of events/ metrics are defined as “Metered Events\":\n\nExposure: When an application calls the Statsig SDK to check whether a user should be exposed to an experiment or a feature flag with Metric Lifts enabled.\n\nLog event: When an application calls the Statsig SDK to log an event or when an event is imported to Statsig from a 3rd party source (e.g. Segment)\n\nIngested metric: When a pre-computed metric is ingested to Statsig from from a data warehouse\n\nCustom metric: When existing events or metrics are used to create a Custom Metric\n\nStatsig dedupes exposure events for the same user and feature/experiment on our client SDKs (60m window; proxy for session duration) and server SDKs (1m window; proxy for user request handling).\n\nExperiment checks that result in no allocation (e.g. the experiment hasn’t started, or has finished) or Feature Flags that have been disabled (fully shipped or abandoned with no rule evaluation) do not generate Metered Events.\n\nBy default, customers are able to include one event dimension (via Value field) with each log event for free. Customers are charged an additional log event for each additional dimension added.\n\nWhat happens if I exceed my free events limit?\n\nIf you exceed the 2 million Developer Tier events limit, you’ll be shown a prompt to enter a credit card to upgrade to Statsig’s Pro tier.\n\nIf you want to stay on the Developer tier, gate and config targeting will continue to work, but Metric Lift computations will stop. You will be sent multiple warning notifications before Metric Lifts are no longer calculated.\n\nWhat happens if I’m on the Pro Tier, and use more than 5M events per month?\n\nStatsig’s Pro Tier includes 5 million Metered Events per month. Once you exceed this amount, you’ll be charged $0.05 per additional 1K events used within the month billing period. This overage fee will be included in your monthly bill, which will be charged to the credit card on file.\n\nIf you want to lower your bill, you can switch to an Enterprise plan at any point. We offer significant volume discounts to Enterprise customers, dramatically reducing costs at scale. Reach out to our sales team to learn more.\n\nWhen will Statsig charge me?\n\nOn Statsig’s Pro tier, you will be charged a baseline fee of $150 per month at the start of each billing period. If you incur overages during a given billing period, those overages will be included in your bill for the next billing period.\n\nFor example, if your subscription begins on January 1, you will pay a $150 fee on January 1, and on the first day of each subsequent month. If you incur overages during the month of January, the overages will be included in your February 1 bill.\n\nEnterprise customers are eligible for custom billing and payment terms.\n\nHow do I monitor my usage?\n\nTo monitor your usage, navigate to Project Settings and click on the “Usage & Billing” tab within your Statsig console. See our documentation for more details.\n\nHow many projects can I have with a Pro subscription?\n\nEach pro subscription applies to one project only. You can create multiple projects but would need to upgrade them independently.\n\nEnterprise customers can have mutiple projects, contact us to learn more!\n\nHow does Statsig Product Analytics integrate with the rest of the platform?\n\nStatsig provides full featured product analytics that can be used as stand alone solution. However, we aim to solve problems that span the product development lifecycle. A few examples that product analytics enables:\n\nDebug your experiments and feature gate rollouts.\n\nPerform segment analysis of experiment groups or feature gate rules.\n\nView session replays and user event streams in the context that they matter to understand the why behind user actions and experiment results.\n\nMonitor the long term effects of your experiments and feature rollouts.\n\nCorrelate metric movements with feature releases\n\nDo I have to purchase product analytics separately?\n\nAll tiers of Statsig includes core product analytics capabilities. On the free tier that includes our Core Product Analytics features and 1 year of data retention for analysis. On the pro-tier, Full-Featured Statsig product analytics is included at no extra cost. This includes access to all product analytics features and unlimited data retention for analysis.

      "# [Bayesian A/B Test Calculator](https://www.statsig.com/bayesiancalculator)\nSome prefer Bayesian A/B tests for their simplicity and intuitiveness (and Statsig makes them effortless!)\n\nIn contrast with frequentist methodologies, Bayesian A/B tests don’t require p-values, null hypotheses, or confidence intervals. Instead, we can simply state the chances that our test variant beats our control variant, as provided by this calculator. Statsig has full support for Bayesian A/B tests.\n\nHow to use the Bayesian A/B Test calculator:\n\nEnter the number of samples and number of positive outcomes you had for each of your test and control groups. Click calculate and you’re done! The calculator will provide the probability to be best of each group. Here you should apply your expected significance rate: a Probability to be Best of 95% or more is often considered best practice.\n\nLimitations of This Calculator\n\nOur calculator assumes infinite variation of priors, just like Bayesian A/B testing in Statsig, and is limited to integer inputs. If you have a percent or ratio to measure success, you’ll need to represent it as an integer. This calculator also only considers two variants (groups), but if you need more, consider launching an experiment on Statsig.\n\nA/B Testing on Statsig",
      "# [A/B Test Sample Size Calculator](https://www.statsig.com/calculator)\nSetting up a proper A/B experiment involves selecting the appropriate sample size.\n\nThis ensures the test is adequately powered to detect the change while minimizing statistical noise. In statistical terms, we want to detect the minimum detectable effect (MDE) with statistical confidence.\n\nHow to use Statsig’s sample size calculator:\n\nDetermine your baseline conversion rate\n\nThis is the preexisting or expected conversion rate of your control group. For example, if you are studying the effectiveness of a new UI, the baseline conversion rate would be the percentage of people in your audience who are expected to use the desired features without being exposed to the new UI.\n\nChoose a minimum detectable effect\n\nThis is the smallest difference in the behavior or outcome that you want to be able to consistently detect with your study. For example, if you are studying the effectiveness of a new UI, the minimum detectable effect would be the smallest increase in usage rate that you want to be able to detect.\n\nInput your values\n\nThe calculator will use these values to determine the optimal sample size for your study. Its output will be the minimum viable test size and minimum viable control size in order to consistently achieve statistically significant results. How consistent will be based on your statistical power—an advanced input we’ll discuss below:\n\nAdvanced calculations:\n\nThe calculator is automatically set to optimal defaults, but you can adjust the advanced settings to see how they impact your results.\n\nHypothesis\n\nA one-sided test (recommended) is used to determine if the test variation is better than the control. On the other hand, a two-sided test is used to determine if the test variation is simply different than the control.\n\nA/B split ratio\n\nThe default value of 0.5 sets the A/B test to split test users versus control users 50%/50%. Standard A/B test procedure is usually 50-50, but feel free to tune this to your own special circumstances.\n\nSignificance (α)\n\nThe significance value is the probability that a statistically significant difference is detected, given no actual difference exists. This is commonly referred to as a type 1 error or a false positive.\n\nThe default value is set to 0.05, but can be set within a range of 0.01 to 0.1. Lowering this number allows for higher confidence that the difference observed isn’t due to chance, but requires larger sample sizes.\n\nStatistical Power (1 - β)",

Want it in another? Reach out in our Support Slack.\n\nSome Statsig SDKs provide built-in metrics to help you monitor its performance and impact on your application. The specific implementation may vary by programming language, refer to the documentation for the language-specific SDK interface.\n\nThe following interface methods are provided by the Statsig SDK to track various metrics:\n\nInitialization (init): This method is called on sdk initialization and allows users to initialize their observability client (such as StatsD, OpenTelemetry, etc.), preparing the SDK to send metrics and logs to the chosen observability tool.\n\nShutdown (shutdown): This method is called on sdk shutdown, and allow users to perform any actions to ensure graceful shutdown of the observability client, such as ensuring that any pending metrics or logs are properly handled and sent before the SDK is terminated.\n\nCounter: A method that tracks occurrences of specific events.\n\nGauge: A method used to record point-in-time values, such as the number of active connections or other metrics that don’t accumulate over time.\n\nDistribution: A method that tracks distributions of numerical data over time, such as latency or response times.\n\nShould Enable High Cardinality Tags: This method is called on high cardinality tags and allows users to define if certain high cardinality tags (which can generate large data volumes) should be enabled for detailed tracking. By default, all high cardinality tags are disabled.\n\nBelow is a list of the primary metrics currently available in the SDK:\n\nMetric NameTypeTagsDescriptioninitializationdistributionsuccess, init_source, init_source_api, store_populatedTracks SDK initialization duration.config_propagation_diffdistributionsource, source_api, lcut*, prev_lcut*Measures the time difference between the last config updated time vs the time that sdk received the config.config_no_updatecountersource, source_apiTracks occurrences of no configuration updates.events_successfully_sent_countcounterN/ATracks number of events sent successfully to the Statsig server.sdk_exceptions_countcounterN/ATracks occurrences of unexpected exceptions caught.\n\nNote:\n\nAll metrics are prefixed by statsig.sdk., for example, the full initialization metric name in your integration will be statsig.sdk.initialization.\n\nWhile sdk_exceptions_count metric captures all exceptions, certain errors (e.g., temporary network connectivity issues or timeouts) are expected to occur occasionally and are generally not cause for concern. Use this metric to identify unexpected or persistent issues that may require investigation.\n\nTags marked with * (such as lcut and prev_lcut) are high cardinality tags.\n\nHigh cardinality tags are tags that can generate large data dimensions when enabled. These tags are disabled by default, but can be enabled as through Should Enable High Cardinality Tags method on the observability client interface. High cardinality tags include:\n\nlcut: The last configuration update timestamp.\n\nprev_lcut: The previous configuration update timestamp.\n\nMetric Tags:\n\nsource: The source of the configuration update, such as network/bootstrap/datastore.\n\nsource_api: The API endpoint used to fetch the configuration update.\n\nsuccess: Indicates whether the initialization was successful.\n\nstore_populated: Indicates whether the configuration store was populated.",

      "# [What is product observability (and why do teams strive for it?) by Skye Scofield and Jack Virag on 2023-06-15](https://www.statsig.com/productobservability)\nThe general concept of “observability” has been around for a long time.\n\nThe idea originated in Control Theory—a field of control engineering and applied mathematics that deals with the control of dynamical systems in engineered processes and machines.\n\n“Observability” was the idea that you could understand the internal state of a system (i.e., the function of its internal processes) purely by observing external outputs. This idea became a foundational part of how practical people manage complex systems.\n\nObservability as we know it really began in the 1980s when software and computer engineers began to build highly complex computing systems at a massive scale. The easiest and best way to monitor the performance of a system was to identify key outputs and log these outputs.\n\nBy tracking these outputs persistently—and sometimes summarizing them into metrics—engineers could monitor the performance of a system, catch errors, and drive continuous performance improvement.\n\nSoftware development grew even more complex in the 2000s, with the rise of practices like CI/CD, the proliferation of microservices, and the rise of distributed architectures. As deployment frequencies increased, so did the need for real-time monitoring and alerting.\n\nTraditional monitoring tools, which were more reactive in nature, struggled to provide a clear picture of these environments. The need shifted from just monitoring (knowing something is wrong) to observability (understanding why something is wrong). In response, internal tools for for logging, metrics, and tracing (often called the \"three pillars\" of observability) became more sophisticated, and a new ecosystem of tools sprung up in response.\n\nCompanies like Datadog, Honeycomb, and New Relic were created in response to these challenges and have defined the modern Observability category. They focused on enabling all the components of observability across disparate systems, services, and deployments, giving engineers the ability to explore data, understand system states, and troubleshoot issues more effectively.\n\nBut these platforms are still largely focused on fixing infrastructure issues within software systems. They are also primarily used reactively; i,e., people use them to find what went wrong vs. identify things that went well.\n\nAt Statsig, we believe that product teams need observability tools of their own, which are purpose-built for their work. These tools should combine all the depth and granularity of traditional observability systems with better tools for identifying what works and measuring holistic impact.\n\nThese tools are the future of product observability.\n\nWhat is product observability?\n\nProduct observability is a proactive, adaptive, and continuous approach to measuring the impact of what you build, and leveraging that data for future builds. This approach relies on a comprehensive set of tools and practices to measure, learn, and build.\n\nThe baseline of product observability is measurement: A product observability platform should have all the features of a traditional observability platform, including logging, tracing, and metrics.\n\nThese features should be purpose-built for a product use case, so it’s easy to establish a complete catalog of performance, product, and business metrics. Persistent monitoring of all key product metrics can be a huge unlock on its own, letting your team track the overall direction of your product, catch bugs, and more.\n\nIn a product context, top-line metrics aren’t enough for effective measurement. Teams need to be able to break down overall figures based on user characteristics, identify outliers, and dig into the impact of specific features.\n\nHistorically, teams have accomplished this with product analytics plus a complete metric catalog, but this is hard to build and maintain, and difficult to combine with other observability tools (like Datadog).\n\nExperimentation is also a very important component of proper measurement of product performance. Experimentation allows teams to isolate the impact of a single change on the performance of a complex system, which is essential if teams want to quantify the impact of the changes that they’re making.\n\nSimply looking at \"before and after\" impact of big releases can be misleading because there are often many things changing at the same team.\n\nToday, few platforms combine all of these features in one place, with a single metrics catalog.\n\nNext, teams need to learn from these insights: It’s not enough for individuals to see the impact of a release. They need to be able to communicate it to a broader organization to change future behavior.\n\nThis is where tools like comments, discussion threads, and experiment reviews come in. These processes don’t necessarily need to take place within the same platform, but it’s nice if they do.\n\nFinally, teams need to be able to build using these insights.\n\nBuilding new features is hard, but a great set of tools can make it easier. Tools like feature flags and dynamic configs reduce the risk of releasing features, making it easier for teams to build quickly. Great SDKs make the implementation of feature flags, experiments, and event logging a lot easier.\n\nThis complete platform is what “product observability” means to us at Statsig. We’re still on the path toward fully realizing this vision, but it’s what drives our product roadmap.\n\nWe believe that in a few years, this type of platform will be as ubiquitous as current observability platforms.\n\nWhat are the benefits of product observability?\n\nWhile traditional observability focuses on system health and performance, product observability emphasizes understanding how users interact with a product, and how those interactions correlate with system behavior.\n\nThis is especially crucial in modern software development, where rapid iteration and user-centered design are paramount. Here's how product observability can deliver significant benefits to a team:\n\nInformed decision making\n\nWith a holistic view of product metrics, teams get a clearer understanding of user behavior, preferences, and pain points. This means decisions about what to build, improve, or retire are based on data, not just hunches. It reduces the risks associated with product changes and can lead to more effective iterations.\n\nFaster iteration cycles\n\nThe build/measure/learn feedback loop is central to continuous delivery. Product observability shortens this loop by providing immediate feedback on how changes affect user behavior and product performance. Faster feedback means faster iterations, enabling teams to quickly refine or pivot their approach.\n\nReduced errors\n\nBy closely observing how features and changes impact user behavior and system performance, teams can quickly spot and rectify mistakes. This can be anything from usability issues to performance regressions, ensuring that users have a seamless experience.\n\nAmplifying winning features\n\nWhen a new feature resonates with users, product observability helps teams understand why. This knowledge can be used to further enhance that feature, promote it more prominently, or apply the learnings to other areas of the product. The result is a compounding effect where successes are rapidly built upon.\n\nEnhanced collaboration\n\nProduct observability breaks down silos between development, operations, and product teams. When everyone has access to the same data and insights, it fosters a more collaborative environment, leading to better product outcomes.\n\nContinuously optimizing\n\nProduct observability is more than just a set of tools or practices. It represents a shift in mindset towards a more user-centric, data-informed approach to software development and operations.\n\nTeams that adopt product observability stand to gain not just in terms of product quality and user satisfaction but also in agility, efficiency, and overall product success.",

However, I face one big problem. Each team uses their  own solution for experimentation , so integration for ML or complex  experiments become very slow. Have you guys seen this problem ? How do  you think I should solve this issue ? I want to speed up experimentation  or ML implimentation. However, sometime, it takes longer than 2 weeks  to impliment or change it. In addition, since every source is different,   I can create comprehensive experiment. Reporting is also nightmare.  People want to see All kpi but since data is so fragement, I can't  connect all data.\n\nAny guidience will be helpful\n\n## Comment ID kzx7p39 with +1 score by [(brock-statsig, Reddit, 2024-04-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/18o5r0y/experimentation_tool_that_work_across_business/kzx7p39/) (in reply to ID 18o5r0y):\nNot sure if this is exactly what you're after, but I work at Statsig - [Statsig.com](https://statsig.com/?ref=reddit_sdtg16) and we build an experimentation platform for developers and teams. We have several customers who use our products for AI experiments and very complex experiments, I think we have a really strong solution in that space. \n\nDepending on your stack - we also solve the data fragmentation issue by integrating with either your warehouse data or from another source (segment, etc.).

So the very basic code behind running an experiment looks like this: (pseudocode/ python-ish):\n\n  \n`#Say you want to run an experiment on GPT3.5 vs 4:` \n\n`#This line returns randomly either gpt-3.5 or gpt-4 per user:`\n\n`myModel = Statsig.getExperiment(user, \"myLovelyGPTExperiment\").get(\"model\")` \n\n`# do something with the model/ gpt 4,` \n\n`# Then log a success metric like retention, engagement, checkout, etc:`\n\n`Statsig.logEvent(user, \"retained\")`  \n\n\n  \nYou can wrap any code between those experiment variants (in this example, which model) and the logEvent - and over time you'd see a difference in how many logEvents there are per each variant (3.5 vs 4). There are a lot of big tech companies who do all of their experimentation on Statsig, so all of those logevents are unified in one place.\n\nBut if you wanted to bring your own data (segment, Amplitude) or bring your own warehouse data (snowflake, bigquery, redshift, etc.) then you can also just do all of this right on top of that data, never having to do the log events. Then you're using the one company-wide source of truth! Pretty elegant, IMO. Part of the magic of Statsig is that you can then look at this experiment variant across any number of metrics, not just one or two like some other solutions. Let me know any questions you have.\n\n## Comment ID kef83vp with +1 score by [(Glass-Needleworker68, Reddit, 2023-12-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/18o5r0y/experimentation_tool_that_work_across_business/kef83vp/) (in reply to ID 18o5r0y):\nDepending on your stack, you can use something like optimizely or VWO for an experimentation platform that supports web and app, then string it all together with native analytics integrations. Is the analytics backend all the same?

We really like that it's all SaaS based so that we don't have to be good at building or operating a feature toggling service. We also have a hybrid cloud+on premise environment for our own infrastructure, so will occasionally have internet issues at our on premise site. We've employed their relay server which caches all of the flag state on site and pushes usage events once the Internet comes back, so even during an internet outage people and apps that are inside the firewall are uneffected as much as possible. The last part we find super useful is that you can have LaunchDarkly integrated all the way at the client browser (ie. Chrome) all the way into a deeply nested microservice architecture. The flag state being pushed from the SaaS to apps in real time (for flags that are already in place) is really nice from a speed standpoint, I suspect that other tools have similar capabilities though.\n\nHaven't had any pain points with the solution. We have on occasion found something that would be useful to have within the platform and submitted feature requests and in most cases so far have rather quickly seen those features delivered.\n\n## Comment ID hzv2r1b with +15 score by [(LewisStudying, Reddit, 2022-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/t9kdyg/what_feature_toggleflag_service_are_you_using/hzv2r1b/) (in reply to ID t9kdyg):\nCan recommend launchdarkly.

I’m one of the Flagsmith co-founders, so I strongly suggest you use Flagsmith. *Joking*.\n\nPretty much all the feature flag platforms out there are really really good, polished, well thought out products. I’ve spent a lot of time talking to all shapes and sizes of teams whilst working on Flagsmith; here are some things you might want to consider when choosing a platform:\n\n* Does it support OpenFeature? OpenFeature really helps avoid vendor lock in which is often not talked about by vendors (Surprise!), and is easy to get caught out with when using vendor specific feature flagging SDKs! \n* How important is experimentation, A/B testing and analytics to you? There’s a pretty big dividing line between platforms aimed purely at flags for engineering teams (which is where Flagsmith sits) and those that are designed around product teams that are built primarily around AB testing, deep analytics integrations, data warehousing etc.\n* How valuable is flag and data portability to you? Can you move to on-prem if you need to? Can you host flags behind a sealed off network? \n* How well do the SDKs target the frameworks you are using? Especially in JS land, things can get pretty intense with things like Next.js, React Native etc. How do the SDKs treat the frameworks you are working with? \n* How does the design of the platform handle redundancy and fault tolerance? If the flag server is not contactable (not normally due to an outage, more like someone’s device just got taken into an office lift) what will happen to your user experience? \n* A lot of flag vendors store whatever user data you send them; what are the privacy implications of this? \n\nFlagsmith is very much in the commercial open source, built-for-developer-teams side of things. We can go from running on your laptop in 2 docker containers (app server, db) to multi-region, all the buzzwords and a lot of things in between. \n\nThe most important thing is to just start using flags, on any provider!

What's worse, is being in a room full of people that think GA is as comprehensive as a tool like logrocket, hotjar, etc. and can do all the things under the FREE VERSION.\n\nI see the GA tool as top funnel marketing for ecommerce, that helps with attribution for paid advertising and \"conversion\" in a limited D2C distribution channel. The page views thing is cool, but it doesn't tell the journey and in a site full of pages, or pages that do a lot of stuff without re-loading. GA seems... useless.\n\nFurthermore, in my world, I have the customer portal site, so no paid media, no attribution, no marketing, blah blah.\n\nI would love to hear how anyone is really using this tool and can help me to \"disagree and commit\" while making the case for an actual UX tool.\n\nThanks.\n\n## Comment ID lqy2rdi with +23 score by [(PumpkinOwn4947, Reddit, 2024-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1fz16ny/i_hate_google_analytics/lqy2rdi/) (in reply to ID 1fz16ny):\ngoogle analytics is great for general websites\n\nit’s not designed to work with products or applications\n\nalso, the paid version doesn’t really provide much on top of standard functionality\n\ni’m pretty sure that for large scale organizations, nobody uses GA4 as a single source of truth, you’re going to mix data with other stuff and analyse it externally.\n\nthe case for other tools like Amplitude is already there\n\n### Comment ID lqzkj7g with +3 score by [(startbox95, Reddit, 2024-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1fz16ny/i_hate_google_analytics/lqzkj7g/) (in reply to ID lqy2rdi):\n>i’m pretty sure that for large scale organizations, nobody uses GA4 as a single source of truth, you’re going to mix data with other stuff and analyse it externally.\n\nI'm desperately hoping I'm at the only large scale organization that's treating GA4 data as gospel.

GA will track those and report on them. Some default key events like \"scroll\" can be changed so they operate differently, e.g. if you want to track if the user sees 20% of the page or 80% or the whole thing. \n\nThis guide walks through the basics: [https://diggrowth.com/blogs/analytics/google-analytics-4-custom-metrics/](https://diggrowth.com/blogs/analytics/google-analytics-4-custom-metrics/)\n\nYou have to be an admin to actually do a lot of this, which is usually where things become a pain in the ass unless you're the actual growth PM with a direct line to whatever team owns the GA implementation and can make these tweaks, but usually it winds up being some kind of BA or Data ops team and they never want to change anything.\n\n## Comment ID lqyi8ll with +1 score by [(shaqule_brk, Reddit, 2024-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1fz16ny/i_hate_google_analytics/lqyi8ll/) (in reply to ID 1fz16ny):\nHard to believe Google gets away with their product design nowadays, chipping away what made them great a decade ago.

I'd also say it's intended more for marketing analytics than product analytics.\n\nI think it may do more than you realize, though. For example, GA can solve both of the problems you mentioned:\n\n1. Use path exploration to see the journey the user goes through: [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9317498?hl=en](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9317498?hl=en)\n2. To track things that happen on pages without reloading, you need to trigger events for each thing you want to track. You have a few options for that--GA can auto trigger events for some things, you can have devs implement code to trigger events, or you can use Google Tag Manager to trigger events based on the Xpath of the element the user clicks on (and other things).\n\nGoogle Analytics is not an ideal product analytics tool, but if you're stuck with it...you can probably make it do what you need.\n\nIf you want session replay and heatmaps without budget, check out Microsoft Clarity. It's decent and free. Combine that with Google Analytics and you can probably get a lot of what you need.\n\n## Comment ID lrryz9b with +1 score by [(gonzo5622, Reddit, 2024-10-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1fz16ny/i_hate_google_analytics/lrryz9b/) (in reply to ID 1fz16ny):\nGA has been crippled by Google leadership.

The latter quoted us over 40k/year for an application that sees only a few million sessions in that period. The AppConfig cost for the same numbers would be two orders of magnitude cheaper.\n\nThis was only their first quote so I know we can probably negotiate it to a quarter that, but still, this seems exorbitant for what I understand it to be.\n\nThe large number took me by surprise, and makes me think I'm probably missing something about feature flags or their service.\n\nWhen pressed, the sales person only offered reliability as the reason for their prices, but I refuse to believe a 3rd party service would be much more reliable than AppConfig which would literally be in the same data centre.\n\nIs their UX that much better?

In a former life of mine, working in B2C, the LD pricing was just laughable.  In a SaaS you might expect to make $5-100/month per \"MAU\", but in B2C with extensive traffic from SEM, that same MAU might have a .1% chance of converting.   Trying to charge based on MAU is just never going to work when the value per \"user\" is 4 orders of magnitude different in different industries. \n\nBut charging for seats is terrible too.   I've talked to multiple public companies that use LaunchDarkly, but have written custom hacks to share seats (which is A: cheating and B: terrible bc it destroys auditability etc).  \n\nSo what should you charge for as a FeatureFlag tool? \n\nI think charging for servers is fair. The FF service needs to hold open a persistent connection for each server, so that's some \"real work\". And it seems to scale with the size of the business. $1 / server seems roughly fair.  A side project running on 1 or 2 dynos for 1-2$.  A startup with 30 servers running $30/month. A bigger org with 500 running $500.  That seems perfectly fair. \n\nAnd I think charging for requests is fair. If the servers capture the backend usage, what about the 1M DAU that a big DAU has.  The FF service should have some pricing lever attached to this. There are real costs associated with serving flags to 1M DAU, so beware any service that doesn't charge you in some way.  But the cost should be small. 15M requests for $100 or so. \n\nThis charge \\_has\\_ to be small, because there's a trivially easy way for companies to circumvent it if they really want to: just build a skinny wrapper of a server side connection that evaluates data for the browser clients. \n\nBetter FF services also have things like telemetry so you can see which flags are being evaluated. I think it's fair to charge for those services too. \n\nI put a link to pricingcompared in a different post, but the point is there are a lot of competitors (our thing included) in this space with vastly better pricing and the same features and reliability.\n\n## Comment ID jm8f9h6 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/107ubhz/why_is_launch_darkly_this_expensive/jm8f9h6/) (in reply to ID 107ubhz):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID kcm3mhh with +1 score by [(nomoreheadphonejack, Reddit, 2023-12-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/107ubhz/why_is_launch_darkly_this_expensive/kcm3mhh/) (in reply to ID jm8f9h6):\nsites down\n\n## Comment ID jvg3l0q with +1 score by [(aisz0811, Reddit, 2023-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/107ubhz/why_is_launch_darkly_this_expensive/jvg3l0q/) (in reply to ID 107ubhz):\nWe use Configcat, it has unlimited team size and its plans come with reasonable pricing.\n\n## Comment ID kfdg4d5 with +1 score by [(m333zy___, Reddit, 2023-12-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/107ubhz/why_is_launch_darkly_this_expensive/kfdg4d5/) (in reply to ID 107ubhz):\nThere's also this, purely for feature flags.

But there are some important caveats. 1 - if you're using this for sensitive authentication, you need to be careful how you're gating it, e.g., doing it both on the client and server side to ensure people can't just get around it with spoofing the requests. And 2 - you'll likely need some way to map multiple permission variables to cohorts of users - you're not individually saying what each user will have access to, so you'll also need some kind of cohort heuristics and maybe flags that return whole permission/config files instead of just a boolean. A few folks use my company Statsig ([Statsig.com](https://statsig.com/?ref=reddit_sdtg20)) for this, and I think it works best with cohorts and our dynamic configs tool, depending on what exactly you're trying to accomplish.\n\n### Comment ID l0amdte with +1 score by [(Permit_io, Reddit, 2024-04-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/1c6ax40/authorization_feature_toggling_in_react/l0amdte/) (in reply to ID l02s5s6):\nOur main intention to work on this tutorial was the concerns that you shared.

Perhaps Voice requires data collection to be enabled?

Firstly, I appreciate you mentioning us in your question. I also wanted to provide some answers to the questions you’ve asked using my relevant experience in the industry.\n\nThrough talking to customers, prospective customers and even interviewing candidates at Flagsmith we’ve seen people using all of the options you’ve suggested and, in my opinion, they all have a time and a place.\n\nI think your comment can really be split into 2 separate questions: \n\n1. Do I need a purpose-built feature flagging tool? \n2. SaaS or self-hosted?\n\nRegarding the first question, I think the critically important thing to determine is how important having feature flags is to your business / project. This can depend on a few different factors: \n\n1. The size of your engineering team\n2. The architecture of your application (e.g. microservice, monolith)\n3. How tolerant your customers / users are to downtime / errors\n\n(Note that I’m excluding e.g. A/B testing use cases here as it was not part of OPs question)\n\nFor example, if you’re working in a team of 2-3 on a monolith application that isn’t in a regulated industry, then I’d suggest going with the easiest solution. That might be environment variables if you just want to be able to turn features on or off, or change a value, or it might be some DB-based solution (like [django-waffle](https://github.com/jazzband/django-waffle) for example) if you want slightly more control over targeting specific users for example.\n\nIf, however, you’re working in a larger team (or in one of multiple teams) on a microservice based application in a heavily regulated industry, then using a fully featured, robust feature flagging solution is going to be critical in being able to maintain development velocity and provide the level of control needed.\n\nRegarding the 2nd question on whether to go self-hosted or SaaS, that probably depends on a different set of factors. Do you have the capability of hosting it yourself, and do you actually want to be responsible for maintaining it? If you do have the capability, you’ll need to consider how complex the deployment is. Keeping the deployment as simple as possible, at least in smaller teams, is likely going to be important. Some solutions will require you to run multiple services as part of their deployment for example.\n\nSome of the key benefits of self hosting are data-sovereignity and, speaking for Flagsmith here at least, the ability to remove any traffic limits. For example, if you know that you’re going to be running a lot of traffic through the Feature Flagging tool, but don’t care too much about having a large team managing the flags, then you can self-host the platform and only pay for your own infrastructure costs. That way, you get a well tested application, so you can be safe knowing that the large amounts of traffic will be handled well, but you don’t have to pay for the traffic usage. \n\nIf you’re working in a small team, on a project that is getting off the ground, you probably don’t want to have to worry about maintaining another tool in your infrastructure as it’ll take time away from focusing on your product development - the very thing you’re trying to speed up by using feature flags in the first place! In this case, I’d probably recommend going with SaaS to defer all of the maintenance to the vendor. \n\nThere are a number of other reasons to choose self-hosted over SaaS, or vice-versa, but these are some of the key ones that I would recommend thinking about when evaluating what’s right for you.\n\n## Comment ID l0x6gla with +2 score by [(brock-statsig, Reddit, 2024-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1cb3g46/how_do_you_handle_feature_flags_in_production/l0x6gla/) (in reply to ID 1cb3g46):\nI've been working at [Statsig.com](https://statsig.com/?ref=reddit_sdtg22) for the last 6 months - we have feature flags as part of our product, want to disclose that bias - but also I think I have some interesting things to share based on what I see from our customers. \n\nFirst - I think over time the SaaS/ Open-source offers here have both improved a lot (cover a lot of cool use cases) and has got pretty competitive - some options are really affordable. And not just our product - lots of others too (though we do offer [500M free feature flags per year](https://www.statsig.com/blog/introducing-free-feature-flags)). While everyone has there reasons for using a self-rolled solution, I'd argue some flag providers are becoming so cheap/commoditized that it might not be worth it. A few of the things these platforms can do now: manage whole config files like a flag (or in a flag), target users based on cohorts (from Amplitude or Segment), work with really really low latency (few cool ways to configure to make this work). \n\nSecond - I think maybe the new school of feature flags isn't just using them as a \"kill switch\" but linking them with measurement, like an A/B test. This opens really cool possibilities - like automatically rolling back features that drop your metrics. \n\nWhen you see the data behind this - which suggests that [2/3 of features that you launch have a neutral or negative impact on your business metrics](https://ai.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/ExPThinkWeek2009Public.pdf), then you begin to realize why that is really cool/valuable. That being said - its sorta a v2 of feature flag maturity - the most of it still being a kill switch.\n\n## Comment ID l0x4yyq with +1 score by [(gaelfr38, Reddit, 2024-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1cb3g46/how_do_you_handle_feature_flags_in_production/l0x4yyq/) (in reply to ID 1cb3g46):\nEnv vars because we don't have a need for it that often and thus don't need a dedicated tool.

Only specific personnel have the permissions necessary, minimizing the risk of accidental changes. If a flag is toggled accidentally, it's simply a matter of toggling it back.\n\nFor auditing, we use Application Insights, which provides a audit trail for our feature management actions. As well as the job itself which sets the flags that will show who kicked it off.\n\nTesting the various combinations of feature flags is done in stages: initially on a few test clients, then a group of beta clients, followed by a limited percentage of regular users. Once a feature is fully deployed, the flag is removed from both the code and Azure.\n\nThis method does introduce some delays in full feature deployment, but it significantly enhances our ability to deliver continuously with minimal disruption to existing users.\n\nFor feature flags that have been inactive for an extended period, such as six months, the same enablement process applies. We avoid long-standing unused flags, especially for temporary development features, by diligently cleaning up after full deployment of the feature that used the flag.\n\nFor permanent flags, particularly those related to paid features, our primary management tools are thorough documentation and an integrated system that links our billing system with our RBAC system. This setup ensures that feature access is correctly managed according to user subscriptions and roles.",
      "# Post ID 16xboam: WORKING tutorial on how to enable iOS voice chat RIGHT NOW with +29 score by [(BackwardsBinary, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16xboam/working_tutorial_on_how_to_enable_ios_voice_chat/)\nOpenAI uses a feature gating software called [statsig](https://docs.statsig.com/feature-gates). The voice chat feature is only gated on the client-side (i.e. on the iOS app), and not on the server-side. This means that you can enable it by using a MITM attack on your own device.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe ChatGPT app makes an HTTP request to `https://api.statsig.com/v1/initialize`, which returns the following response:\n\n    {\n      \"feature_gates\": {\n        \".....\": {\n          \"name\": \".....\",\n          \"value\": false,\n          \"rule_id\": \"3yqcjHol8kM4fbypFkzhxC:50.00:3\",\n          \"group_name\": \"Incremental production roll-out\",\n          \"id_type\": \"userID\",\n          \"secondary_exposures\": []\n        },\n        ...other feature gates\n      },\n      ...other fields\n    }\n\nI've omitted the many (many) fields that aren't relevant to us. The one that we care about is the feature gate above, with the rule ID `3yqcjHol8kM4fbypFkzhxC:50.00:3`. We can see that the `value` of this feature gate is `false`. If we can get the ChatGPT app to think that this feature gate is returned as `true`, then the voice chat feature will become enabled.\n\n## How to do it\n\nYou'll need to install [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) and set it up on your computer and iOS. I won't go into too much detail here on how to do this, but there are plenty of guides available. This is a pretty good one: https://nadav.ca/2021/02/26/inspecting-an-iphone-s-https-traffic/\n\nNext, you'll want to run it with a custom python interceptor script. Create the following file and save it as `rewrite.py`:\n\n```py\nfrom mitmproxy import http\nimport json\n\n\nclass EnableFeatureGates:\n    def __init__(self, target_url, rule_ids):\n        self.target_url = target_url\n        self.rule_ids = rule_ids\n\n    def response(self, flow: http.HTTPFlow) -> None:\n        if self.target_url in flow.request.pretty_url:\n            if flow.response.status_code == 200:\n                try:\n                    data = json.loads(flow.response.text)\n                    if \"feature_gates\" in data:\n                        for key, value in data[\"feature_gates\"].items():\n                            if \"rule_id\" in value and value[\"rule_id\"] in self.rule_ids:\n                                value[\"value\"] = True\n\n                    flow.response.text = json.dumps(data)\n                except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n                    print(f\"Failed to parse JSON: {e}\")\n\n\naddons = [\n    EnableFeatureGates(\n        \"https://api.statsig.com/v1/initialize\",\n        [\"3yqcjHol8kM4fbypFkzhxC:50.00:3\"],\n    )\n]\n```\n\nAnd then run `mitmproxy` in the same directory as the script with the following command:\n\n```bash\nmitmproxy -s ./rewrite.py\n```\n\nThen force quit and reopen the ChatGPT app and you should now be able to enable the “Voice conversations” feature!! 🎉🥳\n\nThe main caveat is that if your app restarts and the traffic is not routed through the MITM attack, then voice chat will become disabled on your device again until the wider rollout is complete. In practice, as long as I don't force quit the app, this isn't really an issue. This check only happens once when the app starts, and I've gone the whole day without this breaking down.\n\nThe other issue is that you have to install a custom root CA cert to your iOS device which allows MITM attacks. This IS NOT SAFE and you should definitely remove/disable it after you've performed the attack on yourself. This way you can keep ChatGPT working with voice and then when you wish to restart it, just re-enable the root CA again, run the attack, and disable it. Voila!\n\nHope that helps, please let me know if any q's\n\n---\n\n1. **Edit 2nd October 2023 11:15am** - I've fixed an issue in the interceptor script. Seems that the `rule_id` remains constant, but the name/key could change. I've hopefully made it more robust by targeting the `rule_id` instead.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID k4ayulp with +5 score by [(vontinqin, Reddit, 2023-10-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16xboam/working_tutorial_on_how_to_enable_ios_voice_chat/k4ayulp/) (in reply to ID 16xboam):\nTaking inspiration from this workflow, I've write a Quantumult X version.

Perhaps I'll dig into it a bit this evening after work!\n\n#### Comment ID k37x4ej with +1 score by [(jnjustice, Reddit, 2023-10-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16xboam/working_tutorial_on_how_to_enable_ios_voice_chat/k37x4ej/) (in reply to ID k348uw5):\nI think they have a lot of mismatched access, I have 'browse with bing' enabled on android but it doesn't show up.\n\n## Comment ID k34ii3t with +1 score by [(AutoModerator, Reddit, 2023-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16xboam/working_tutorial_on_how_to_enable_ios_voice_chat/k34ii3t/) (in reply to ID 16xboam):\nHey /u/BackwardsBinary!\n\nIf this is a screenshot of a ChatGPT conversation, please reply with the [conversation link](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7925741-chatgpt-shared-links-faq) or prompt.

      "# [How Statsig Grows: The Story, Growth Motion, Product, and Market by Aakash Gupta on 2024-10-29](https://www.news.aakashg.com/p/how-statsig-grows)\nYou know those famous posters around the Facebook offices?\n\nThe one that says ‘Be scrappy’ is attributed to Vijaye Raji, the founder and CEO of Statsig.\n\nAs they say: behind every phenomenal startup lies a phenomenal founder.\n\nIn talking to a former colleague of Vijaye’s at Meta, this is what I heard about him:\n\nHe was one of the culture carriers at a young Facebook. Since he arrived in 2011, he always stood out as someone who embodied Facebook’s values. The entire exec team loved him since he became VP in 2017.\n\nToday, we’re going to crack open Vijaye’s new company’s growth and strategy to see what they’re doing.\n\nIt’s a story of bringing the best Facebook had to offer to data-driven product development, but then evolving as they learned what customers wanted.\n\nToday’s Post\n\nWords : 4,738 | Est. Reading Time: 21 mins\n\nAfter talking to 5 Statsig folks, 3 customers and 2 customers of competitors, I’m excited to present the web’s deepest dive yet into the company:\n\nThe Story of Statsig\n\nHow Statsig Builds Product\n\nThe 7 Layers of Statsig’s Growth Motion\n\nStatsig’s Market Position and Future Growth\n\nThe Post in a Picture\n\nShare\n\n1. The Story of Statsig\n\nChapter 1 - Facebook\n\nThe Founding Insight\n\nIn the 2010s at Facebook, Vijaye built several billion-dollar businesses - Mobile App Ads, Audience Network, Marketplace, Gaming, and Entertainment.\n\nEach of these efforts relied heavily on Facebook’s culture of experimentation - and infrastructure to support that.\n\nWant to test a new feature?\n\nLaunch an experiment?\n\nAnalyze the results?\n\nAs Pierre Estephan, a former Staff SWE at Meta, and now Engineering Manager at Statsig, recalled:\n\nThese tools just worked.\n\nAnd, in that tooling, Vijaye saw something bigger.\n\nHis teams moved fast, making thousands of small improvements with tools that made experimentation seamless.\n\nDeltoid, Unidash, and Scuba (the names of these tools) weren’t just analytics platforms—they were the engines behind Facebook’s rapid product development.​\n\nThis was the insight behind founding Statsig.\n\nAssembling a Team\n\nDuring his work-from-home days in 2020, between back-to-back Zoom meetings, Vijaye started imagining how to bring these capabilities to the wider world.\n\nNot just the tools themselves, but the entire infrastructure that made Facebook's experimentation culture possible.\n\nThe first call went to Marcos, his engineering lead over late night games of DOTA2. Marcos agreed with the opportunity.\n\nTogether, they began quietly connecting with the most talented engineers they knew. Not through formal recruitment channels, but through direct conversations about building something new.\n\nThe criteria were specific: they needed people who understood both high-performance systems and the statistical rigor required for experimentation tools.\n\nMost importantly? They needed builders who could move fast.\n\nCommitting to In-Person\n\nBy the time they were done, they had assembled an elite squad: six engineers who were well versed in building for scale, and one data scientist who understood the math behind it all.\n\nThey all got together to work in-person in Seattle:\n\nThey weren't just leaving Facebook - they were taking its best practices and preparing to rebuild them from the ground up.\n\nChapter 2 - 8 Months to a Customer\n\nEarly Struggles\n\nThey put together a strong MVP in short order, and beta launched in May 2021.\n\nThen... silence.\n\nThe team had built something they thought was incredible. The kind of experimentation platform that Facebook engineers took for granted. The sort of tooling that could help any company move faster, build better, test smarter.\n\nBut they couldn't give it away. Vijaye would later recall, in thinking back to those eight months:\n\nIt was one of my lowest points.\n\nThe product was free, yet still no one was biting.\n\nThey had the engineering talent. They had the infrastructure. They had built exactly what they set out to build.\n\nWhat they didn't have was a single paying customer.\n\nEvery startup faces its dark night of the soul. For Statsig, it was watching month after month go by, wondering if they had built something nobody wanted.\n\nThe Ex-Facebook Connection\n\nHad they been too deep in the Facebook bubble? Had they overestimated the market's need for sophisticated experimentation tools?\n\nIt seemed that way until Jeff, an ex-Facebook PM now at Headspace, reached out.\n\nFinally — someone who understood exactly what they had built. Someone who recognized the power of Facebook-grade experimentation tools.\n\nSomeone willing to sign a contract.\n\nThat first deal changed everything. Within about a year, they'd hit $1M in ARR.\n\nBut more importantly, they'd learned something crucial: maybe the path to success wasn't just about replicating Facebook's tools.\n\nMaybe it was about evolving them into something new entirely.\n\nChapter 3 - Experimentation\n\nA Strong Entrypoint\n\nThe experimentation product became their trojan horse.\n\nAs Margaret-Ann, their Head of Product, puts it:\n\nExperimentation is our most mature product - it’s best in class. It has opened up the most conversations.\n\nOne by one, major tech companies started taking notice. Notion. Brex. Affirm. Each one that signed on made the next conversation easier.\n\nThe pitch was compelling: Facebook-grade experimentation tools, but accessible to any company. Want to test new features with the same rigor as tech giants? Now you could.\n\nTheir reputation began to grow. Former employees of big tech companies, now at smaller firms, became their biggest champions. They knew what good looked like - they'd used similar tools at places like Airbnb and Uber.\n\nFigma. Electronic Arts. OpenAI. The logos kept getting bigger.\n\nDirect Access\n\nIt wasn't just about having the tools anymore. Statsig's team had become known for building alongside customers and forming deep partnerships with them.\n\nWhen a major customer wanted to implement the platform, Statsig would often send engineers on-site to help them succeed:\n\nNo ticketing system\n\nNo layers of support to wade through\n\nDirect access to the people building the product\n\nThe experimentation platform had evolved beyond what even they had imagined at Facebook. It wasn't just a copy of internal tools anymore - it was something better.\n\nSomething that could work for everyone from startups to enterprises.\n\nBut as they'd soon learn, this was just the beginning of what their customers wanted.\n\nChapter 4 - Warehouse-Native\n\nInitial Resistance\n\nJune 2023 marked a turning point.\n\nCompanies were tired of sending their data everywhere. They had invested heavily in Snowflake and BigQuery warehouses. Why couldn't tools just meet them where their data lived?\n\nThe market had shifted, but most players hadn't noticed. Optimizely was still cloud-first. The only real competition in warehouse-native was Eppo, a specialized player.\n\nInitially, Statsig resisted. As Jiakan Wang, Head of Enterprise Engineering, recalls:\n\nWhen we first heard about it, we didn't have that perspective. We were building what Facebook had. We didn't think what they had was that good.\n\nOne Customer Changing the Trajectory\n\nThen, HelloFresh changed everything.\n\nIt was their first major warehouse-native contract. The product wasn't ready - but instead of saying no, Jiakan took a team of three engineers and embedded with HelloFresh.\n\nWe scrambled, built a lot of features. We showed we were really willing to work with them even though the warehouse native had less features.\n\nThe gamble paid off. After a few months of intense iteration, they had built something better than any warehouse-native offering on the market.\n\nWhile Amplitude was still \"teasing\" warehouse-native features and had a limited beta on select warehouses, Statsig was winning deal after deal.\n\nMixpanel didn't have it at all. LaunchDarkly and Optimizely didn’t have it either.\n\nA New Growth Vector\n\nThey had found their next growth vector - meeting enterprise customers where their data lived. As Pierre notes:\n\nIf you already have mature pipelines or precomputed metrics, you want to go warehouse native.\n\nIt became a good chunk of their new bookings.\n\nBut more importantly, they had learned something crucial: sometimes the best opportunities aren't in copying what worked at Facebook.\n\nThey're in building what customers actually need today.\n\nChapter 5 - Product Expansion\n\nProduct Analytics and Session Replay\n\nBy September 2023, Statsig had two successful product lines - Feature Flagging & Experimentation.\n\nThey sailed past $10M ARR in 2.5 years - a huge feat for anyone.\n\nBut they weren’t done. They launched Product Analytics, directly challenging Amplitude and Mixpanel.\n\nSession replays followed in August 2024.\n\nScalability\n\nBut the real test came from Figma.\n\nThe design software giant had extreme requirements for reliability and stability - so extreme they initially decided to stay in-house. But Statsig made promises, rebuilt their infrastructure, and won them back months later.\n\nThen came OpenAI.\n\nAs their AI models exploded in popularity, OpenAI needed a platform that could scale with them. They didn't just become Statsig's biggest customer - they completely blew past their initial contract volume.\n\nThe platform didn't blink.\n\nStatsig enables us to grow, scale and learn efficiently.\n\n—Dave Cummings, Engineering Manager at OpenAI\n\nOpenAI expanded their usage to feature flagging and product analytics as well - a major victory in different products category altogether.\n\nToday’s Success\n\nThe numbers tell the story:\n\n>$25M ARR\n\n1000s of self-serve customers\n\nHundreds of major enterprises\n\nProcessing >1 trillion events daily\n\nHandling 11.5M events per second\n\nMaintaining four nines of availability\n\nThe Vision\n\nThe vision has evolved: become the one-stop data platform for any product builder. Not just experimentation. Not just feature flags. Not just analytics.\n\nEverything.\n\nHere’s from Vijaye himself on the vision:\n\n\"Product building is our primary moat,\" he explains. \"The only way to mitigate risk is to keep building.\"\n\nFrom Facebook replica to warehouse pioneer to full-suite platform.",
      "# [Statsig Product Updates](https://www.statsig.com/updates)\n🔨 Rust Core SDK\n\nServer Core is a full rewrite of our Server SDKs based on a shared, performance-focused Rust library. Today, we're launching the Rust library itself as a standalone, brand-new Rust SDK.\n\nPerformance & functionality exclusive to Server Core\n\nSo far, we've launched Node, Java, PHP, Python, and Elixir Core SDKs. Each of those depends on the Rust core, which today we're launching as its own SDK. Given its usage across numerous languages, we've invested in performance optimization of this Rust library, with substantial improvements vs. our original Rust SDK. In addition, Rust Core has new-to-Statsig features like Parameter Stores, Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits, and more.\n\nRust core is available on crates - read the docs to get started!\n\nAggregated Launch Impact\n\nQuantifying your impact is critical. Statsig's Insights page provides you a clear view of how experiments impact a metric of interest. It allows you to focus on a single metric, identify which experiments are driving it most and estimate the aggregated impact. You can filter down to a team, or a tag. This is particularly useful to understand your team’s impact or set a reasonable goal for a future period.\n\nYou navigate to the Insights section on the Statsig console, or the insight tab for each metric, to check it out. Learn more here.\n\n🚨 Topline Alerts\n\nWant to monitor new sign-ups? Want to be alerted if feature performance is slow or a page fails to load? Topline Metric Alerts allow you to monitor a metric's topline value, independent of any Feature Gate or Experiment Rollout.\n\nTo configure a Topline Alert, head to Analytics -> Topline Alerts tab where you can find all your Topline Alerts and configure new ones. Choose the event you want to alert on and the aggregation you're most interested in, then craft a notification message and configure alert subscribers. To learn more, check out our docs here!\n\nNote: this feature is in Beta and not broadly available (yet!) Please reach out to us if you'd like to be opted in for early access.\n\nTopline Alert Configuration\n\n🍷 Elixir Core SDK\n\nToday we're announcing the Statsig Elixir Core SDK, in an early Beta. Elixir core is built around our performance-focused and rust-based Statsig Server Core library, that we're rolling out across multiple languages and frameworks. The Server Core library will receive feature updates and performance optimizations rapidly given its usage across multiple SDKs. Elixir core is written with Rustler and has some operations that are dirty scheduled, so it may not work in all Elixir environments. This SDK is in early Beta, and we'd be happy to hear your feedback in our Slack Channel. Get started with Elixir core in our docs!\n\nShow related experiments during experiment creation\n\nHaving your history of experiments attempted lets team's create institutional memory. When you create a new experiment with a hypothesis, Statsig now shows you existing, related experiments in case you want to explore what has already been done. You can always go to the knowledge base to explicitly look for this context too - but it's delightful to have this surfaced in-context without being intrusive.\n\nFilter SDK Experiment Exposures on Warehouse Native\n\nIf an implementation issue means that you've over-exposed users to an experiment, you can retroactively apply a filter to only analyze people truly exposed to an experiment. This was previously available on Analyze Only experiments on Warehouse Native (to work around over-exposure from 3rd party assignment tools). It is now available for Assign and Analyze experiments (where you're using the Statsig SDKs for assignment).\n\nTo do this, use the Filter Exposures by Qualifying Event option on the experiment's setup page (under advanced settings).\n\nThis filtering is also possible to do in Custom Queries (under the Explore tab).\n\nExample use case : There is an experiment on search suggestions, visible only when people click into the search box. User's are currently exposed when the search bar renders, but this causes dilution, since all users see the search bar. In this case, we'd want to filter down exposures to users who actually clicked into the search box - so we'd point to a Qualifying Event (defined in SQL) to filter exposures down to this subset of users.\n\n🟢 Node Server Core SDK\n\nServer Core is a full rewrite of our Server SDKs with a shared, performance-focused Rust library at the core - and bindings to each other language you'd like to deploy it in. Today, we're launching Node Server Core (Node Core).\n\nPerformance & functionality exclusive to Server Core\n\nNode Core leverages the natural speed of a core written in Rust - but also benefits from all of our latest optimizations in a single place. Out initial benchmarking suggests that Node Server Core can evaluate 5-10x faster than our native Node SDK. Beyond that, Node Core supports new features like Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits, and advanced bootstrapping functionality, like bootstrapping Parameter Stores to your clients. Using Node core with our Forward Proxy has even more benefits, as changes can be streamed, leading to 1/10th of the CPU intensity.\n\nNode Server Core is in open beta beginning today, see our docs to get started.

It's time-consuming, and let's not forget about the inevitable human errors that creep in. These hiccups slow us down and make the whole development process feel clunky. But here's the good news: automating deployments can take that stress off our shoulders, letting us get back to what we love—writing awesome code.\n\nIn this blog, we'll explore how automating your deployments to staging environments can streamline your development process. We'll dive into setting up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, managing multiple environments with infrastructure as code, and share some best practices to keep your pipeline running smoothly.\n\nThe need for automating deployments to staging environments\n\nLet's start by acknowledging the trouble with manual deployments—they're a drag. Not only do they eat up valuable time, but they also open the door to human errors. These challenges lead to delays and reduced productivity, making the development process more frustrating than it needs to be.\n\nBut there's a better way: automating deployments can alleviate the stress associated with manual processes. By automating, we allow ourselves to focus on crafting quality code instead of wrestling with deployments.\n\nThis is where Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) comes into play. By automating the build, test, and deployment steps, CI/CD makes sure our changes hit the staging environment quickly and consistently. That way, we can spot issues early, iterate faster, and keep things moving smoothly.\n\nPlus, automating our deployments to dev staging environments keeps the workflow smooth and minimizes risks. No more worrying about manual errors, and we ensure that staging closely mirrors production. This consistency is key to catching problems before our users do, upping the quality of our software.\n\nAnd let's not forget the team benefits. Automating staging deployments boosts collaboration and transparency. With a solid CI/CD pipeline in place, we can share our work easily and get feedback from everyone involved. This not only speeds up delivering high-quality features but also helps foster a culture of continuous improvement.\n\nSetting up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions\n\nEver tried GitHub Actions for automating your workflows? It's pretty neat. GitHub Actions lets you set up automated workflows triggered by events like code commits. You can write custom workflows using YAML, specifying triggers, jobs, steps, and actions. This means you can automate building, testing, and deploying your app with ease.\n\nWhen setting up a CI/CD pipeline for dev staging, actions like \"Check Changes\" and \"Set Environment\" come in handy. They figure out which files have changed and set the right environment variables for your workflow. By using these actions, you make sure your pipeline deploys the correct code to the right place.\n\nTake Malthe Poulsen's automatic deployment workflow as an example. His \"Check Changes\" action detects changes in specific directories, like backend or frontend. Then, the \"Set Environment\" action decides whether to deploy to production or staging based on the branch.\n\nBy adding these actions into your workflow, you can build a solid CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds, tests, and deploys your code to the right dev staging environment. This cuts down on manual work and helps catch issues early on. With GitHub Actions, you can create custom workflows tailored to your project's needs, keeping your deployment pipeline smooth and efficient. At Statsig, we've explored building custom CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, and it's made a real difference in our development process.\n\nManaging multiple environments with infrastructure as code\n\nDealing with multiple environments can get messy, but tools like Terraform make it a whole lot easier. With Terraform, you can define your infrastructure consistently across staging and production environments. By using infrastructure as code, you keep your dev staging and production resource groups in sync, reducing discrepancies.\n\nEnvironment variables and configurations are key here—they help direct deployments to the right environment. In his article on automating deployments with GitHub workflows, Malthe Poulsen shows how to maintain two identical resource groups for different environments. Keeping staging and production as similar as possible helps smooth out transitions and avoids surprises when you deploy to production.\n\nPoulsen's GitHub repository is a great example of structuring your project to support multiple environments. By organizing your codebase and configs to handle both staging and production, you simplify infrastructure management and deployments. This approach promotes a DevOps culture focused on collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement.\n\nBest practices for maintaining and optimizing CI/CD pipelines\n\nKeeping your CI/CD pipelines in top shape is key to smooth software delivery. One way to do this is by monitoring your pipelines using tools like workflow visualizers and live logs. They give you real-time feedback on performance and help you spot issues fast.\n\nAnother tip is to optimize pipeline efficiency with caching and parallel execution. By caching dependencies and build artifacts, you cut down build times by skipping redundant downloads. Running jobs in parallel can also reduce the overall pipeline duration.\n\nDon't forget to update your workflows regularly. As your project evolves, you'll add new features, dependencies, or tools. Updating your workflows ensures your pipelines stay aligned with your project's needs and perform their best.\n\nEfficient resource use matters too. Keep an eye on CPU, memory, and storage usage to spot bottlenecks. Adjust resources based on job requirements, and optimize your Continuous Integration processes—for example, run tests only on code that's changed.\n\nFinally, adopting best practices like dev staging environments and Blue-Green Deployment can boost reliability and cut deployment risks. Dev staging mirrors production, so you can thoroughly test before going live. Blue-Green Deployment lets you switch between versions seamlessly, minimizing downtime and giving you rollback options if needed.\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nAutomating deployments to staging environments can make a world of difference in your development workflow. By setting up a solid CI/CD pipeline with tools like GitHub Actions, managing multiple environments with infrastructure as code, and following best practices, you can streamline your process and deliver high-quality software faster.\n\nIf you're keen to learn more, check out the resources we've linked throughout the post, and feel free to explore how Statsig approaches building custom CI/CD pipelines.

Most other platforms on this list offer larger buckets with more features.\n\nKey differences vs Statsig:\n\nAdvanced experimentation capabilities: Statsig includes sophisticated experimentation tools such as Holdouts, Ultrasound, and Smart Feature Gates.\n\nDiverse data integration options: Statsig offers multiple methods for importing and exporting data, such as APIs, Data Warehouses, Data Collectors, Webhooks, and CSV files.\n\nAnalysis and ease of use: Statsig is built to be accessible and useful for both enterprises and small teams, with an emphasis on easy analysis that is not limited to data scientists.\n\n📖 Related reading:The top 4 VWO alternatives for visual website optimization\n\n6. PostHog\n\nPrimarily geared towards: Hobbyists, self-starters, open-source enthusiasts\n\nFounded in 2020, PostHog is the leading open-source feature management platform for DIYers, scrappy solopreneurs, and engineers.\n\nA bottoms-up organization, PostHog officially launched on Hacker News only 4 weeks after its developers started building it. Four years later, PostHog has found its stride targeting “high-potential startups,” stating a deliberate focus on open source users “instead of focusing on enterprise.”\n\nIts reasoning: “This will better help us increase the number of successful products in the world.”\n\nHowever, despite being firmly positioned as an open-source platform, many PostHog features aren’t open-source, particularly its enterprise features, which focus on scalability, security, and advanced analytics.\n\nSo while users may be initially attracted to an open source product offering, premium features like SSO, permissions, access control, long-term data retention (and reporting), and others, are locked away behind PostHog’s enterprise tier—which PostHog ultimately wants its “high potential startup” target audience to scale into.\n\nPricing model: PostHog’s pricing model is largely usage-based, with analytics events, feature flags, A/B tests, etc., all hitting a paywall after a certain amount of usage.\n\nStarter tier: PostHog has a free tier as well as a hilariously named “Ridiculously Cheap” tier. Its free tier includes, per month:\n\nUp to 1m events\n\n5,000 session replays\n\n1m feature flag and A/B test requests\n\n250 surveys\n\nPostHog’s Ridiculously Cheap tier doesn’t expand usage-based limits but adds additional projects, features, 7-year data retention, and more.\n\nNotable features:\n\nFeature management and A/B testing\n\nSession replays\n\nSurveys\n\nProduct analytics\n\nWatch out for PostHog is not for everyone, especially medium-to-enterprise-sized businesses looking for a cloud or warehouse-native experimentation platform. Its self-hosted option—which was its original product offering—has since been sunset, with its own recommendation being to simply use its cloud-hosted version.\n\nUsers have expressed some pretty intense frustrations with errors and glitches, as well as trying to get PostHog off the ground: “They (PostHog Support) usually say ‘looking into that’ and then never reply.” Unlike Statsig, its pricing model is also complicated according to its users, which makes costs difficult to estimate.\n\n⚠️ Open source users beware: PostHog describes its open-source self-hosted option as “hobbyist” and warns that it only scales to around 100k events per month.\n\nKey differences vs Statsig:\n\nExperimentation features: Statsig offers sophisticated experimentation features, including multivariate experiments, Bayesian experiments, dynamic configurations, and experiment layers, making it particularly well-suited for businesses that require detailed, complex experiment setups and rigorous analysis\n\nData hosting flexibility: In addition to its cloud-hosted solution, Statsig offers a warehouse-native option that allows users to store all data in their own data warehouse, which can be crucial for compliance with specific data residency requirements.\n\nHigh data volumes: Statsig is specifically tailored to handle extremely high volumes of data and user traffic with minimal latency. Ensuring that performance remains robust under heavy loads is essential for real-time data processing and immediate application of insights.\n\n📖 Related reading: Cloud-hosted Saas versus open-source experimentation platforms: The pros and cons\n\n7. Growthbook\n\nPrimarily geared towards: Growing companies, open-source enthusiasts\n\nGrowthbook is an open-source feature flagging and experimentation platform that allows companies to use their existing data infrastructure and business metrics.\n\nFor advanced use cases and larger-scale operations, GrowthBook offers a cloud-hosted version, providing flexibility for companies that don’t want to manage the infrastructure themselves. This version supports the same feature-rich environment as the self-hosted option, but with the added benefits of cloud scalability and reduced overhead in IT management.\n\nThe platform's integration capabilities allow businesses to pull metrics directly from data warehouses they already use, enabling seamless and real-time data analysis.\n\nPricing model:\n\nPro tier: $20/user/month (cloud-hosted)\n\nEnterprise: Requires a conversation with sales\n\nStarter tier: Growthbook has a free open source version for up to 3 users, unlimited feature flags and experiments\n\nNotable features:\n\nFeature flags, experiments, projects\n\nCustomizable experiment reports\n\nFeature audit logs and versioning\n\nWatch out for: As with most open-source feature management platforms, it’s your responsibility to ensure your infrastructure is scalable if you plan on using Growthbook’s open-source version.\n\nFor the enterprise version, most user complaints focus on the user interface being difficult and/or unintuitive. Also, its Flutter SDK does not have parity with its React SDK, as it’s community-maintained.\n\nLastly, the Growthbook query editor seems to be in need of improvement, as one user states that it “should allow better insights.”\n\nKey differences vs Statsig:\n\nManaged infrastructure and scalability: Statsig provides a fully managed service, meaning companies do not need to worry about the overhead of setting up and maintaining the infrastructure necessary for their experimentation platform. Statsig handles high data volumes while maintaining high performance with minimal latency.\n\nAdvanced product analytics integration: Statsig integrates deeply with product analytics, providing users with a unified platform to manage experiments and analyze product data seamlessly. This integration allows for more nuanced insights and data-driven decision-making without the need to juggle multiple tools.\n\nUsage-based pricing model: Statsig’s pricing allows businesses to scale their usage up or down based on their needs without worrying about exceeding user limits or incurring unexpected costs.",
      "# [Statsig Case Study](https://cloud.google.com/customers/statsig)\nExperimentation is a foundation of IT innovation, and the more teams can test and try new things, the better chance they'll discover the next big breakthrough. Enabling developers to succeed requires affordable, intuitive, and agile platforms so they can efficiently experiment and manage new apps and features.\n\nThis is where Statsig comes in. The company launched in 2021 to create a one-stop shop for product developers to access everything they need for feature development and management, as well as analytics. Enabling experimentation was a focus from the beginning.\n\n\"One of our main competitive advantages is the ease with which developers can experiment within our platform,\" says Jason Wang, Lead Software Engineer at Statsig. \"We provide feature flag integration to more naturally aid discovery, as well as an intuitive console to interact with data and interpret results without a full data science team. We have an incredible engineering team and the speed that they can respond to customer requests is mind-blowing.\"\n\nAfter first building its platform on another cloud, Statsig decided to migrate to Google Cloud with the help of its long-time observability partner, and Google Cloud partner, Datadog.\n\nSeeking greater speed, cost efficiency, and reliability\n\nStatsig was primarily concerned about data management costs when it first looked at other cloud providers. The company manages terabytes of data daily, while its customers require enormous amounts of computation and need their experimentation results within a day or less. The legacy cloud provider could not keep up with growth or deliver at the speed Statsig's customers require.\n\n\"We started our first Google Cloud project with BigQuery, and that's now the foundation for our data infrastructure and computational capabilities,\" says Wang. \"From there, we wanted to explore the full suite of Google Cloud products, with the API-focused services critical to our decision given how important APIs are to our business.\"\n\nCore Statsig services, such as feature flags, are deemed as critical services to Statsig's customers. The underlying platform is essential to help the team meet customers' expectations. As a Kubernetes-first team from its beginning, Statsig uses many Kubernetes and its ecosystem features to ensure its engineering excellency. Therefore, the support of cloud-native features is a key to the team when choosing a provider. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provides more support for cloud-native APIs than the other cloud providers Statsig considered.\n\n\"Moving over to Google Cloud allowed us to embrace more open-source technologies and adopt APIs with open standards, which make our lives a lot easier as we develop new capabilities and operate existing functionalities,\" says Wang. \"Now, our core API service and computation of data from customers all take place within Google Cloud. This helps from a cost-efficiency standpoint and simplifies managing and maintaining our infrastructure. We see a lot more reliability and stability than we had in the past.\"\n\nFrom an additional savings perspective, Memorystore for Redis reduces costs associated with in-memory data store services by 70% compared to Statsig's legacy provider. The company can now transact two million queries per second (QPS).",
