      "# Post ID 135xojm: Is Data Annotation a scam? with +1344 score by [(jonbestinsnow, Reddit, 2023-05-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/)\nDoes anyone know if data annotation is a scam? They have projects you work on for money. I can’t remember if I gave them my venmo username or not.\n\n## Comment ID jpzj1rz with +172 score by [(coffeenebulamom, Reddit, 2023-06-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/jpzj1rz/) (in reply to ID 135xojm):\nI am happy to report that it's definitely not a scam! I have been working for them for a couple of months now and made a couple thousand bucks. They test and train all kinds of AI, and they look for people who can write pretty clearly and  read instructions very well.   \n\n\nHow it works: most of the writing type jobs are hourly jobs that pay out around 20 per hour give or take. You report your own time but they will audit your work, and if you're lying about your time or not doing a good job, they pull you off projects. Conversely, if you do a good job, they wil offer you more projects. \n\nThey have a timer that pops up on the screen but that is just for your information. You'll need to track your own time separately. \n\nThey offer Slack Channels where you can get help with any questions you can, talk to other users, or connect with an admin. You can also connect with an admin on most projects within the project page where they have a chat and an admin. \n\nThe make you wait exactly 7 days to get paid on those hourly projects. You cash out to paypal, and once you hit the blue pay button, the deposit hits instantly. Every time you cash out, you have to wait 72 hours before the blue button shows up again. \n\nThey also have some per-task projects that don't necessarily pay as well. Those you can get paid in 3 days on. Two examples of this: I did a job labeling the race and number of people in a profile pic for 2 cents each. That washed out to about 8 bucks an hour for me and was heckin boring but I could do it while I was watching a pretty involved TV show. Another project I did was deciding if a post was sexual in nature or not. \n\nThe hourly jobs are pretty varied but generally are writing-related. On the other hand, you don't really have to be an English major, just able to write worth a heck and read very detailed instructions and follow them. \n\nExamples of projects I have worked on:\n\n\\-Deciding betweeen two AI responses where the AI is a chatbot pretending to be Tony Stark, Taylor Swift, a Matchbot, Marcus Aurelius, or a DM. \n\n\\-Writing both sides of an AI conversation where the user asks the AI to brainstorm or write short stories. \n\n\\-Trying to trick an AI into writing harmful or toxic content. \n\nI hope this helps you all out, and I hope the website is as useful to you all as it has been to me.  Please feel free to lmk if you have any questions.\n\n### Comment ID lhxj1b6 with +69 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-08-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/lhxj1b6/) (in reply to ID jpzj1rz):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID ls5trw6 with +49 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-10-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/ls5trw6/) (in reply to ID jpzj1rz):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID mbh70a6 with +40 score by [(Local-Bunch-257, Reddit, 2025-02-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/mbh70a6/) (in reply to ID jpzj1rz):\nI have been out of my job for more than 3 months now.

Like they might want you to trick the AI and then penalize the answer that falls for the trick, for example. A lot of projects you'll have 2 different responses from 2 different LLMs. \n\nOne thing I've realized is different tricks seem to work on different models or maybe for different reasons. Like some AIs for no reason get confused on things like \"reverse alphabetical order.\" But my favorite hands down is asking the model to RP and then getting it to participate in unsafe behavior after it denied that request.

One of mine was a prompt asking the Chatbot to summarize two books and some related project. The prompt also briefly told the AI a synopsis of the book and project and wanted it summarized better. One Chatbot gave a detailed and well written summary, however the book doesn't actually exist. They don't want the AI giving false information so check everything before just assuming the prompts are legit. I checked and passed that one because I researched and saw that book wasn't in existence. Also, don't write too much or too little. If it asks for 1-3 sentences, etc. Then write exactly what it requests.

I am doing code related stuff for $40 bucks an hour. I can also vouch that it's real as my earnings since I started broke $1,000 last week.\n\nI did a programming assessment that took 2-3 hours which wasn't too bad where they ask open ended questions that basically say \"show off your expertise\". Most of the actual tasks I have to skip because they are in sub-specialties or languages I am unfamiliar with (i.e. I know some lisp but no javascript). But I think the point is that when enough people look at the tasks eventually someone with the right background puts down an answer.\n\nThe code comparisons, responses and etc are detailed but they let you spend even multiple paid hours validating code so you can post a screenshots of it running in a generic environment.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: They seem interested in paying a flat fee for quality work. As best I can tell they won't bother or penalize you as long as you are not making unrealistic claims of how long stuff takes. If tasks are easy to do quickly do them quickly. If they take time then look at what the maximum allowed for that task is (this will be in the instructions), and skip it if you think it would take you longer. Focus on the stuff that you specialize in as a general rule.\n\nExample: Once something was wrong with the interface and I wasted 3 hours (partly due to misunderstanding on my part). I emailed details of the task and some screenshots to back it up. The company just said \"You are new so no prob! here is $120 of pay... just don't make a habit of it\"\n\n### Comment ID l1g7uhy with +2 score by [(trademesocks, Reddit, 2024-04-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/l1g7uhy/) (in reply to ID jpzj1rz):\nTHis is an old thread, but to anyone thinking about applying with these guys - look how many 1 star reviews they have on trustpilot, and see how they all complain about the exact same things.    \n\n\n\n  this company looks shady af, but i encourage whoever reads this to look at the companies trust pilot page to judge for themselves.\n\n### Comment ID l4q3bk9 with +2 score by [(RakmarRed, Reddit, 2024-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/l4q3bk9/) (in reply to ID jpzj1rz):\nYou are legit a bot aren't you?

I sent you a DM, if you get a moment & can look into my issue, I'd be deeply grateful. I'd been working very consistently for DAT for a few months. I never didn't have work. I stepped away due to a family emergency beginning 1/30. From what I can see DAT underwent a few tech issues and hired thousands more people in that time. I'm now desperately trying to get back to work, as I have a disabled family member to help support & my dashboard only says to check back soon & watch email notifications and has done so about a week now. The last email notification for projects I got was 2/2. I've spoken with an Admin who says my tasks should be accessible to me. I've tried emailing support, but have not heard back. I'm making this comment here in the hopes you'll see it and look into it, in case your DMs are slammed. Thank you for any assistance you can provide.

As far as I can tell they do not email you if you failed. Your best bet is try again with a new phone number. \n\nIf you get to the point of being able to edit your account information, make sure to add all the relevant qualifications you have (you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it). \n\nI took my time with the initial assessment which is \"estimated 45 minutes\" and it took me well over an hour. Maybe close to 2. There are right and wrong answers for the initial assessment; that's how they can grade applicants. When I tried to submit one question with a wrongly selected multiple choice option, I was informed of my wrong answer and given a tip to do proper research. This did not cause me to fail the evaluation. Your chance to shine is in the comments for each question showing your thought process. I personally used the \"Optional Comments\" section liberally. \n\nWithin a week I was given access to the two secondary qualifications, and within a week of those I was given access to the board of listings. \n\nGeneral tips I would keep in mind while doing these assessments: \n\n* **Think as if you're the owner of the GPT model**. For example, you may want \"harmful\" responses when you're personally using a GPT model, but say you owned a full scale model with millions of users. Would you want the liability of your model providing harmful output? Absolutely not. \n* **Be specific** when commenting on why one response is better than another. \n* **Do accurate research when necessary**, and take your time to do it correctly. \n   * Quick tip: my favorite fast method of checking information is: `highlight text, CMD + C, CMD + T, CMD + V, ENTER` Even faster: `hold CMD/CTRL and press in order: CTV` (Copy, open new tab, paste in search bar, enter). It takes less than a second and usually the information is right there at the top of the search. \n   * Open a link in a new tab: `CMD + Click`. Open a link in a new tab and switch to that tab: `CMD + SHIFT + Click`. (Useful for sifting through multiple search results without losing the initial search result tab). \n   * Close a tab quickly: `CMD + W` \n* I don't want to say grade the responses \"harshly\", but the point here is to **make the GPT models better**. Wouldn't you like it if you were able to take for granted that these models could accurately do everything you ask it to? So when they fail to do so, grade them down for that.  What are current shortcomings of these models we are all aware of?\n   *  Not particularly great at math \n   * Bad at counting the number of characters in a response \n   * Don't always adhere to the small instructions when given a complex prompt, the list goes on\n* **Be logical**. The tasks are broken down pretty well as far as what exactly you're grading for each task. The instructions are also very explanatory. \n* **Most of the work is hourly**. There's no need to rush through each individual task because that has no effect on your pay. However, the models suffer if you rush. If your work quality is poor, you don't pass the evals and/or your standing on the platform is lowered. \n\nI'm not a representative of the platform in any way.

I like a lot of your advice.\n\nHowever, I disagree with “if you think with your emotions you won’t make it on this platform”. For example, when testing for homophobia or sexism, topics we may feel strongly about, it’s good if we have emotional intelligence to guide our logic.\n\nWhat I’ve been doing is writing my comments/explanations during work in a similar tone to how I’m typing right now, but I don’t ignore my emotional intelligence at all when making decisions.\n\nThey often want you to be able to understand the human context/nuances that chat bots often miss (like sarcasm or the attempt to make the bot engage in hate speech etc). Lack of emotional intelligence/awareness can also be a detriment.\n\nI’m pretty new though to be honest so I could be wrong and I’m doomed. I really hope they keep me on for at least 6-12 months though.\n\nI’ve read up on a lot of cases where people claim they were let go for no reason or warning. So I’m obviously scared about that and trying to be okay with whatever happens. But yeah no, I have been searching for a looong time to have an actual opportunity like this, and for once I actually feel like I’m making a rewarding income. I really hope I don’t get let go of. I know people have said “to expect it because it can and will happen to ya” but I don’t know. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on those cases? (I’m assuming you’ve seen those posts on this subreddit as well)\n\nAnd how long have you been doing work on DA? :)\n\n#### Comment ID kjhf7mu with +3 score by [(joolley1, Reddit, 2024-01-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/kjhf7mu/) (in reply to ID kduu5x6):\nDo you know how to get tasks for a particular programming language?

Today is Monday. No response. I was able to (in my opinion) give pretty solid responses for everything and I nailed the coding challenge, but the inputs they provided had no solution and I did double check so I thought that was weird. Kobyashi Maru? With a valid input it worked fine. I left appropriate comments and clean code. It’s just a BFS algo. Or DFS if that’s what you fancy.\n\nNothing yet. \n\nI followed every direction to the letter.\n\nI’ve been a senior level and staff level software engineer for a while. I’ve worked with and implemented LLMs including ChatGPT up to 4o for a while too so I’m very experienced with it and how to improve LLMs.\n\nI’m not an expert but I’m more than qualified. \n\nI will say the “leetcode” style question was far too tedious for them to not allow AI because if you know how to use LLMs you can at least show me how to solve it if I’m interviewing you and I’d be fine with it as an interviewer so long as you understand the problem and can solve it. \n\nIf I get overlooked well, I get paid way more than $40 an hour to do this stuff elsewhere so who knows. \n\nThey could also be saturated with applications right now too.\n\n## Comment ID jjpiefx with +16 score by [(spcbttlz, Reddit, 2023-05-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/jjpiefx/) (in reply to ID 135xojm):\nNot a scam.

Not a scam, but I think it's hard to get approved. I got accepted probably about 6 months ago and have been doing it occasionally whenever I want some extra spending money. They give you 5 referral codes and you get some amount of money I can't remember for each person who gets approved. I gave all mine out but none of my friends got approved lol, I think they're picky. I have a master's degree and none of my friends do, maybe they cared about that. \n\n  \nBut how it works is you basically log in, see a list of \"projects\" to work on and they usually range from $20-$25 an hour. You can complete qualification tests to be eligible for higher paying projects, like stuff that involves coding knowledge. Those ones would be more towards the $30/hr range. Then after you work on the project, you just enter the amount of time you spent doing it and after about 5 days, the money is available to be transferred to your PayPal account. I've never had any problems with my reported time getting approved and receiving my money.\n\n  \nI think it's a great option to have if you know you're about to have an expensive weekend or if funds are feeling tight that month.

They take about a week to verify the time before you can pull the funds into your paypal, but they do.   \n  \nIt's a great little thing to just be subscribed to so you can do it when they send you stuff, but definetly not something to depend on.

Some scammers will also ask for money during the “interview” process.\n\n>To make sure you don’t get burned by a possible job, first look closely at the job description. If the listing is vague and full of misspellings, and the job poster has an unofficial (like from gmail) email address instead of a business email address, it’s probably a scam.\n\n>Of course, don’t forget to google the company, even using the terms [company name] + scam or fraud to see if anyone has called them out. Other red flags include not conducting face-to-face ( in person or on a video call) interviews while only communicating via email, and not offering an employment contract before demanding work get started. \n\n>Then there are more gray areas. Some AI data entry jobs aren’t technically scams, but they do pay shockingly low wages.

I think if you know coding you can get 25, but I'm not sure.\n\n## Comment ID kpjrg6g with +5 score by [(Astrayinthesosu, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/kpjrg6g/) (in reply to ID 135xojm):\nAbsolutely not a scam. In fact I make more morning here than any other job I have ever had. Just make sure your work quality is high. Test into different jobs that pay more, and acquire skills on the side like coding if you don’t have any. I work anywhere from 35-80hours a week (my choice to work when I want obviously), and I make around 260-420 a day doing this (average about 300). Just keep at it and don’t let people’s past negative experiences make you or anyone interested in it think it’s a scary position or a scam. I’ve been doing it for about a 1.5 years and have no plans on stopping soon.\n\n### Comment ID kvfh2qm with +3 score by [(patsun123, Reddit, 2024-03-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/kvfh2qm/) (in reply to ID kpjrg6g):\nCan you recommend how to get good training for doing coding?\n\n#### Comment ID kvfqetf with +2 score by [(Astrayinthesosu, Reddit, 2024-03-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/kvfqetf/) (in reply to ID kvfh2qm):\nI went to school for computer science but I always suggest general self practice.

From March to June 2024. I think I made around $8,000 on my account, $6,500 of which I can verifiably say ended up in my PayPal account (that's their only method of paying you). I was suddenly removed overnight, with no access to my account, and I can promise you that I truly did my work very well, because it's hard to find a better, more convenient method of earning, especially for myself, being in the process of moving across the country for several months. I wasn't about to jeopardize my standing with the platform in the interest of being lazy and not doing my best work.\n\nAnyway, I woke up one morning and logged in, and I was met with a page that read \"Your account has been permanently suspended\", or something very similar to that effect. This was with around $1.5k still sitting in my account, which I had made just in the last week I was on the platform. There is absolutely NO way for me to access this money. So that's about a week of wages that I lost in a snap. There's a support email to reach out to, but it clearly isn't monitored, as several attempts to appeal the decision or request my fairly-earned wages have not been answered. There's basically little to no legal recourse I can take to get this money back, and this seems to be a trend.\n\nTo answer anyone's questions as to why I had $1500 sitting in my account, the hourly pay takes 7 days to be approved, and you can only request a payment every three days. I had just withdrawn over $1k around 4 days previous, and I was waiting for my next available \"cashout\". If you consistently spend 10 hours a day on the platform like I did, doing projects that paid $20-25 an hour, you could feasibly make $1400 to $1750 a week. You report your own time, but your work speaks for itself, and if it is not deserving of the time you claim, I'm sure that could throw up some red flags, so I made sure to be accurate in my reporting, and at least round down if I did excessive research on a task.\n\nI would say that it's not a scam in terms of trying to get your information, because your personal information such as your email and phone number are arguably not nearly as valuable as the time you'd spend correcting the AI models that you're training, and many sets of human eyes are preferred to AI judges. They do not request any money from you or call you, but I want to warn anyone considering their platform to be aware that they can just deactivate your account without warning or explanation (I got no prior negative feedback on any of my work, and was consistently added to new projects after completing many tasks effectively). I can only imagine that they might have seen my work and perhaps took it to be the work of AI, as this is one of their main rules that they warn against, but I can promise that I would not trust current AI capabilities to complete tasks like this effectively, and it really does not make sense to outsource this to another AI.\n\nTLDR; It's not a scam, they probably don't care about your personal information at all except to make sure you're not duplicating your accounts. They do pay, and the pay is decent, but it can be taken away with no warning, with no legal way to fight this. They also do not have a reasonable way to contact any support team.\n\n### Comment ID lpv9h9q with +2 score by [(SilverMonitor1530, Reddit, 2024-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/lpv9h9q/) (in reply to ID lehvv06):\nSame thing just happened to me.

There's not a lot of regulation, ethics are akin to whatever serves the ultimate and often hidden kingpins, the rate of innovation keeps the whole phenomenon ahead over its skis and everyone but the secret execs are just scrambling to keep up, influenced by a murky, subliminal messaging campaign that they should be grateful for what they have and ignore whatever void they may find themselves in, regarding humane communication - some of which would serve the aims of the company.\n\nI've seen folks comment about how they were denied projects due to 'quality' issues, with no explanation.   Along with corporatocracy / plutocracy, we are living in a freaky fucking technocracy, and the common denominator for all three is a howling gap where humane ethics and, ultimately, common sense should be.\n\nThe outer planet Pluto takes around 250 years to complete an orbit around our star, and stays in one of the twelve divisions of the zodiac for many years at a time, defining a generation and an era.  It has now stepped fully into the sign of Aquarius (associated with technology, mass movements and social constructs, among much else). The last time Pluto was in Aquarius saw many of the revolutions that define what may be left of 'Western Democracy'...  So the human vs machine, worker vs kingpin yada yada will see some kind of AI iteration..

Data Annotation have probably done this in an attempt to filter out the large number of applicants. In their LinkedIn ad, in less than a day, over 570 people applied to just that one job they posted.

I've seen several redditors who at least claim to have made thousands of dollars with them. Some of these posters really seem to struggle with writing. Obviously, we don't write as carefully on a random forum as we would write for work, but these posters confuse \"your\" and \"you're,\" use apostrophes to form plurals, struggle with subject/verb agreement, and say things like \"...the amount of people who...\" and \"...there is always plenty of projects.\" These aren't just typos. They reflect fundamental language deficits. I know that grammar and mechanics are not the sole focus of DA, but it doesn't make sense to have LLMs trained by people who would be C- students in an 8th grade English class. I suspect that they're doing something other than seeking out the most competent / most analytical writers they can find to train AI to compose text of the highest possible quality. It just seems that highly qualified, skilled writers and researchers are being passed over in favor of workers who write *intelligibly*, but not *well*. Their use of AI to make hiring decisions is also highly suspicious. If they have technology that can reliably assess the quality of human writing, why can that same technology not assess and correct its own writing? Why do they need humans to do that--humans who have been *selected by AI*?\n\n### Comment ID lfb154q with +2 score by [(dicemonkey, Reddit, 2024-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/lfb154q/) (in reply to ID lcpilqw):\nThey’re training it to deal with the people training it ….easier to answer questions or deal with someone who communicates precisely and  effectively ….they’re training it to deal with the dumdasses by training it on dumbasses …..they also seem to cut contact with people while still owing money …basically stealing their last paycheck\n\n## Comment ID ldft8d1 with +2 score by [(Longjumping_Ad_1831, Reddit, 2024-07-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/ldft8d1/) (in reply to ID 135xojm):\nAlright so I took my assessment a couple of months ago and have gotten exactly ZERO job opportunities.

They specifically seek out folks who can do work themselves, cheating on the application is a pretty good sign they don't want someone like you doing this. Genuinely, if you read what they're asking you for and take your time doing it, you will get accepted and offered a TON of different qualification tests that will open up loads of potential jobs for you. The lowest I have  seen is $19/hour. I took the application test and was sent the follow up \"core\" and \"coding\" qualifications tests the NEXT DAY. After taking the core test (I don't know how to code yet so I didn't take that qualification test), I was accepted again, within 24 hours and able to start working on the platform. My entire onboarding process was roughly 72-96 hours. Im telling you, if you take your time to actually pay attention and do a thorough job, you will be rewarded! Besides, you're being paid hourly lol why wouldn't you take your time to do a good job?\n\n### Comment ID lhenrag with +2 score by [(EmployerPitiful8314, Reddit, 2024-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/lhenrag/) (in reply to ID le5ipjo):\nThanks for the tips.

I completed the online application and submitted it. I waited about 4 days or so with the website page saying 'Thanks for taking the assessment!'. Today I logged on to check it out to see if I had progressed any further, and it has changed to say 'At the moment, there aren't any projects available for you to work on. Please check back soon and watch out for new project notifications sent to your email.'.\n\nSo my question here: Does this mean I have been accepted? I haven't received an email saying I have been accepted, but the website page is suggesting (or I think) that I am approved and will be set to receive work in the future. Any opinions of others would be appreciated on this as I'm left a little befuddled as it isn't very clear as to whether I'm accepted on it or not.\n\n  \nCheers!\n\n## Comment ID kzqfkzl with +1 score by [(Brum7306, Reddit, 2024-04-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/kzqfkzl/) (in reply to ID 135xojm):\nMostly they are just getting AI content by requiring \"tests.\" After you complete a few of their so-called tests, they give you the \"just one more qualification test\" which then presents dozens more Inquiry examples, and asks you to respond to each of these inquiries as if you are AI.

The project with 400 tasks is the only project on my dashboard and it seems from the ones I have gotten through, it is the same thing over and over.

Been working with them for a month tomorrow. Multiple payouts that were pretty much instant. Lots of work is available if you pass the qualification tests. I think the amount of work you get also depends on the quality of work you provide, and your level of professionalism in your ability to explain your responses. Once I did the initial qualification test I got an email saying that I had passed around 3 days later. I started immediately with the $20 projects, passed a side-by-side fact checking qualification, and now have multiple tasks regularly available for $25 and have even done some up to $28 which are more urgent tasks. Hourly pay listed is in USD. I am in Australia and have just reached over $1000 AUD. This could potentially be much higher as I only work around 1-2 hours a day usually, 4-5 days per week.

If you test well, you may get projects to work on.\n\n3) projects will come and go. If you do well on them, and they are available, they put the projects back on your dash.\n\n4) as far as I can tell, they paid me and paid me well for work completed (I have made over 25k with them to date).\n\nThat's it. Some of the projects are a freaking blast. If people produce low quality work or are off on there time reporting, they will likely have problems.

I was suddenly removed from the platform around a month ago and the Slack channel they use for support - at the same time. If I tried to click on 'contact admin' it just refreshed the page. So they made it impossible for me to contact any staff or other project workers after kicking me off the site with no notice.  \n\n\nI worked full-time hours (as it was advertised) most weeks for the last year with no issues with my work and no issues with payouts.  \n  \nI would like to mention that on trust pilot I have a review way further down on their thread giving a good review for data annotation - this was one of the tasks on our dashboard when everything was rosy - no it wasn't a paid task, but it's a very sneaky way of trying to get their review rating up. Let's get people to write a great review, then we can drop them when we feel like it and make ourselves impossible to contact - they literally don't have the balls to contact people if there has been issue with their work etc. Totally unprofessional. I do actually still have the email for a woman that works in admin, but of course she hasn't responded cause she doesn't have the backbone or professionalism to be straight with people - none of them do.  \n  \nSo don't be fooled by any 5 star reviews, as many of them are a result of being on the dashboard of workers with encouragement to leave reviews for them. I've seen on here and other review sites that other people haven't had issues etc, but believe me, it will happen. You will get kicked off with no notice no matter the quality of your work, so all the chat on Slack and project chats \"oh we appreciate you...\" etc is all a load total crap.  \n  \nI honestly think this company should be highlighted further and addressed as they are getting away this disgusting behaviour....for now. The fact that some people are not getting the remainder of their payouts with no contact or reasoning is theft. I've read reviews with people not getting up to $3000 and upwards of what they are due. Total robbery.  \n  \nDo yourself a favour and don't join them - they are scumbags. And if you still have the rose tinted glasses on that they're alright and it won't happen to you, please take them off.  \n  \nI send this to everyone from a place of kindness, as I don't want even more people going through what myself and many many others have.  \n  \nFind something more stable and secure where the company have the respect to tell you if there are any issues with your work. Data annotation is not it.  \n  \nHave a great day folks!\n\n## Comment ID llzjg4t with +1 score by [(CertainIsopod4298, Reddit, 2024-09-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/llzjg4t/) (in reply to ID 135xojm):\nI signed up and worked for about 2.5 months straight.

Also, the company employs creative tactics to get free work out of you. For instance, the application process is 1-2 hours of coding exercises and sample problems, which they're undoubtedly using to train thier models. Furthermore, after being hired there is about 20-30 \"qualification exams\" you must pass to unlock a steady stream of work as well as access to higher paid work. Of course, they're likely using these exams to train their models as well.

The key is to do your research. Big platforms like Appen, Lionbridge, or Clickworker are known for offering real, paid data annotation work, so if you’re working with one of those, you should be fine. I’d suggest double-checking the site you signed up for and looking up reviews or experiences from other users. If you can’t find any, it’s better to be safe and walk away. Also, if they’ve been asking for sensitive info like your Venmo username without a good reason, it could be worth reaching out to Venmo’s support team to check on the security of your account.\n\n## Comment ID m87kn44 with +1 score by [(cremington10, Reddit, 2025-01-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/m87kn44/) (in reply to ID 135xojm):\nNot sure but the needed phone verification so I gave my google voice number which they would not take so I had to use my cell, now I get a bunch of spam texts\n\n## Comment ID m8kkxin with +1 score by [(Wahga307, Reddit, 2025-01-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/m8kkxin/) (in reply to ID 135xojm):\nCan people from different countries work for this data annotation company other than USA\n\n## Comment ID m8oaec0 with +1 score by [(Sudden_Pirate6965, Reddit, 2025-01-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/m8oaec0/) (in reply to ID 135xojm):\nAlthough I can't say for sure it's a scam, since I did not get that far (for reasons I'm about to explain), I *can* say that they are dishonest and at best unprofessional.\n\nFor reference: the quizzes ask you to determine which chatbot/response is better based on the prompt that was given. It also asks you to proofread and point out any inaccuracies or false information (this is ironic in hindsight).\n\nI took the starter assessment and passed. When I took the core assessment, I noticed a *serious* error in the prompt for the chatbot that confused me, basically saying that 18.1 million is bigger than 16 billion (it is not). After a few minutes of Googling, I traced that mistake back to a website that uses AI voice recognition to transcribe earnings calls and posts them. This article was littered with grammatical and numerical errors, matching up with the mistake I saw from Data Annotation. And just one link down was an actual article that accurately transcribes the earnings call.\n\nMoral implications from that AI scraping website aside, Data Annotation did *not* cite where they copy pasted the transcript from, and the fact that they didn't proofread the article first before using it as one of their core assessments is severely disappointing, especially when their assessments are literally asking you to do that.\n\nAfter finding that out, I lost all motivation to continue the assessment. I felt like I just wasted 2.5 hours of my time basically just taking a college English test I never thought I'd have to do again. It made it clear to me that the company simply doesn't care. They just want to enlist as many \"employees\" as possible to analyze AI chatbots for them, likely paying pennies on the dollar compared to what they'd have to pay for someone in-house, *IF* you even get accepted. It's also important to note that the application assessments are unpaid, but they *definitely* still use your responses to train their chatbots with how specific the requirements are.\n\nSo, do whatever seems right to you. If it works out, great! It might not be a scam, but personally I would avoid this company.\n\n## Comment ID m8xea03 with +1 score by [(RepresentativeAd1181, Reddit, 2025-01-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/m8xea03/) (in reply to ID 135xojm):\nIts not a scam as of this morning they sent me an email to do a side hustle and review code for $40hr.

First question is this? Does everyone that does contract work for Data Annotation Tech do the same thing? I am not sure. But my experience is this: They had me do product optimization tasks as they call them. There are certain sales order bundles where yes you get a higher commission but the processing of these bundles cause your funds to go negative!! And YOU have to use YOUR OWN MONEY to clear the negative! Obviously that already sounds sketchy. They do NOT tell you about these details prior to your starting your work!  Sure you get that money back but you have no choice but to put up that money. In my first 3-4 days on the job, I had a negative $80, then another small amount, then on day 4 I had a negative $515 which was greater than the total that I had earned at that point. I had to put up the $515 OF MY OWN MONEY to clear this negative. Later the same day another sales order bundle caused my account to go to negative $1,600! Yes, I was forced to put up that $1,600 to get my own money back as well as what I had earned. I fought as hard as I could, but they would not give me my money back. To be accurate, yes you get your money back after you put it in. The scam is pressuring you to put up large amounts of money to access your own funds! I saw very large increases in the sizes of the negatives and I am guessing they get larger and larger so that at some point you simply don't have the money and/or feel uncomfortable putting up that amount! THAT IS THEIR SCAM!!! Maybe the others chiming in had different work or different experiences....or maybe they are lying! 100% guaranteed that I am being honest about my experience! Do NOT do Data Annotation Tech! THEY SCAMMED ME and may very well or probably will SCAM YOU!!!\n\n## Comment ID mg8o0fs with +1 score by [(MacGyver98, Reddit, 2025-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/mg8o0fs/) (in reply to ID 135xojm):\nIt keeps telling me I need to “complete one more assessment”, but each time I do it makes me complete another one.

Haven't had any issues getting paid whatsoever and have been able to work 40 hours per week.\n\nThey favor quality work so if you're hoping to breeze through the assessment and tasks and still make $20/hr, it's probably not going to happen. I use extreme attention to detail and read all of the instructions (which are often a lot). But the more quality work I do, the more jobs I get and the more money. I have plenty of work available to me and get added to new projects regularly.\n\n## Comment ID k2gszao with +1 score by [(Many_Elevator_3149, Reddit, 2023-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/k2gszao/) (in reply to ID 135xojm):\nHow long did it take you to get approved to be on the site?\n\n## Comment ID k3009uf with +1 score by [(Hot-Stand5631, Reddit, 2023-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/k3009uf/) (in reply to ID 135xojm):\nI dont know what to say, I've registered and I've done the initial assessment almost a month ago and nothing so far.

Still no responses and there is no actual customer service rep phone or email that you can reach out to. If you are looking to partake in this hold off unless you get information about an available job. At the end of the day they are collecting data including those who apply and don't seem to give you the option to opt out of it being collected. I don't trust this website or the way it runs and believe that it may somewhat be a scam as most of the reviews I see are people who have a similar experience as me with a sprinkle of good reviews that only ever talk about DataAnnotation on this site.

I signed up for data annotation in either December or January, can't remember which. I just looked back through my emails and I got my acceptance email January 2. Can't remember how long I waited to get accepted after taking the initial assessment, but it wasn't immediate. Initial assessment wasn't hard per say, but it was time consuming and required more original creative writing than I am used to doing. \n\nI made my account and took one or two assessments. I then proceeded to promptly forget about the entire site and didn't log in again until today (I signed up when I was in a bit of a manic, I should quit my job and work from home full time type of spiral, then I remembered I need healthcare). Just went on again today (2/18/24), took some more assessments, which actually were kind of hard and took me about two hours, unpaid. Then I started doing the only project with tasks that were available to me: Creating prompts for AI and then comparing two AI responses and determining which performed better. \nI worked at it for 90 minutes and got paid $30. **got paid in terms of, that's the amount they quoted I made. Will have to wait a week to see if I can actually get the funds into PayPal. If there's no issue with getting the money, then this is definitely not a scam and people need to stop using that term to mean \"it took a ton of my time and I didn't get anything out of it,\" because that's misleading. But, if I run into issues and don't get paid then...it's deffo a scam because they will have taken a bunch of my time and I wont have gotten anything out of it. \n\nMy point being, it's still worth it to apply as they seem to be taking applications.\n\n#### Comment ID ksnpkqy with +2 score by [(AnywhereGeneral4965, Reddit, 2024-02-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/ksnpkqy/) (in reply to ID kqysz49):\nCan confirm!

I took the assessment on a Friday and got an acceptance email the following Monday. I work as much as I want (about 3-4 hours a day for now) when I want, and I'm over $350 for the first week. I've completed one payment transfer and it went to my PayPal with no issues. If they're asking for Venmo it's probably not legit. Just go to the actual website to apply and take the assessment. If you don't hear back then you're probably not what they're looking for. You need to be an effective communicator, a critical thinker and detail-oriented. I currently make $20-$22 an hour for my work, and you can make more if you can do coding. I can't but I think they're more like $35 an hour for coding projects. This works well for me because I've got chronic health issues and it helps that I can work from bed, in my pjs, and on my own time. There are no schedule requirements or minimums to work. I usually do an hour or 2 at a time a couple of times a day intending to make $1400-$1600 a month and I'm on track for that goal so far.\n\n## Comment ID keoqrjm with +1 score by [(BigPapaSha, Reddit, 2023-12-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/keoqrjm/) (in reply to ID 135xojm):\nSo I took my test about 1-1.5 months ago, received a second email that said congrats on passing initial review, take some qualifications and start earning!

It took her 24 hours to hear back after the initial 'test' and I didn't hear back for 8 days (which was annoying but have patience). Once I got accepted, I started working a little here and there on jobs just to make some money to see if it ever made its way to my account.\n\nI'm self-employed but I still have some downtime that I wanted to use to make some extra cash, and I can say that after almost a month working remotely with DA they have paid out $450 for the work I've done. Almost immediately to PayPal once I click 'transfer funds', its legit.\n\nThis thread has some contradictory stories, so I wanted to share mine in case it help anyone. At least from my experience: Yes, its legit, yes, I get paid, and yes there seems to be plenty of work. Keep in mind I am not doing this 40 hours a week; I might just do 5-10 hours a week. Lastly, there is a chat within the interface (once you're accepted) to ask questions of both other 'employees' and people that run DA. There is also an email for support that seems to get back to you within 24 hours if you email them with any issues, so they arent as MIA as this thread makes it seem.\n\nFeel free to message me with any questions about the process, I'm still semi-new but I wanted to help out people in my shoes when I first came across the DA gig posting.\n\n## Comment ID ksc1zq4 with +1 score by [(brianhoneycutt, Reddit, 2024-02-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/ksc1zq4/) (in reply to ID 135xojm):\nI've been working with them and receiving money via Paypal, so I would say it is not a scam.\n\n## Comment ID ksm3v3d with +1 score by [(remustucker, Reddit, 2024-02-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/ksm3v3d/) (in reply to ID 135xojm):\nI signed up over 2 weeks ago and never heard anything, and I have tons of relevant experience.\n\n## Comment ID ksnn35o with +1 score by [(AnywhereGeneral4965, Reddit, 2024-02-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/ksnn35o/) (in reply to ID 135xojm):\nSo, I tried this company based on a tik tok rec.

As unfortunate as it is, DA seems to be heavily reliant on using automated systems to get rid of workers producing low-quality work or breaking rules, and I’ll admit, that system most probably isn’t perfect, but that’s how it is.\n\nHowever, people can always take out money as soon as possible to avoid having too much of it stashed in their DA account.\n\n#### Comment ID l1vedwz with +1 score by [(bls61793, Reddit, 2024-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/l1vedwz/) (in reply to ID ku9ziws):\nIf there are enough people with similar stories: file a class action\n\n### Comment ID kzb9la2 with +1 score by [(Freezepeachauditor, Reddit, 2024-04-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/kzb9la2/) (in reply to ID ksr9c1f):\nDid you ever get paid?\n\n#### Comment ID kzcekmj with +1 score by [(Dreemurr9, Reddit, 2024-04-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/135xojm/is_data_annotation_a_scam/kzcekmj/) (in reply to ID kzb9la2):\nTwice before getting locked.

Scammers don’t do that. \n\nIt’s also a contract job, so we can be “fired” for any reason. \n\nI think it’s legit. But I always monitor my personal information with the credit bureaus anyways.

Then today, I got an email and it's a long header..paraphrasing..'You're one step away from unlimited paid opportunities'...However, in the actual email, it says the following...\n\n'Congratulations on passing the DataAnnotation Starter Assessment! Did you know that only a small percentage of applicants meet our quality standards? Nice work!\n\nTo unlock open-ended work, we’ve put two, **paid** qualifications on your dashboard. Once you complete them, we will automatically review your results and match you with projects that fit your expertise. These could include:\n\n* Talking to an AI chatbot\n* Evaluating responses to your prompts\n* Labeling photos\n* Writing stories or code\n\n[Complete your paid qualifications](https://u20443333.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=znc2AX4UJ-2BBIlF-2BXsiEJNBJRmHeSMCEqrLdb7RvRlIr8wXQUQFLZXhHXxiqV9IPTw-2BZ2dMCA-2F3qeEZLE1fqrwo7HsxHNHBDPFRGMX40Vg3XhVrJdXB-2Bg8IPSRVNLh5LW-2FUBjfCnN-2B5n2yHupqsdZ8Q-3D-3D-rh5_t8vIo4SB-2B4gxgBS9ahmUk0J4ATAXBBCe3-2Bf6RlXuRdW547KCG48Ndjkvwr-2BjvJAygXvVGDhx6r9SjFHsM6nmCWWMfyQP8W8IHFuOxYbSRgK497-2BC5Jy7NeeNOIRvYMoSJ9C3PQc46oSmZTyT83ZD203Rd41knrE0DenoJ0Uw9G3plZfvlTuh88qOf1pkgnkbYTCUhqVuMVdbEHgUbU-2FAKg-3D-3D) ASAP and find remote work, unlike other work. **Get started today!'**\n\n\\----\n\nAt first, I thought, *I already took the Starter Assessment, and unless there are two more paid qualification tests, then that seems a bit odd*.   I clicked on the 'Complete your paid qualifications' tab and it took me to the dashboard and nothing had changed.  It still is not highlighted in green that I am ready to start working, but it also doesn't have two more qualification tests.\n\nI am just curious if any of you have gotten that email after taking the two qualifications tests, because it seems a bit strange, and I'm not sure where to go from here since it's saying I'm one step away, but the step they ask me to take next, I've apparently already completed. \n\nAny help, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks.\n\n### Comment ID k7u91i0 with +3 score by [(Striking_Walk_7017, Reddit, 2023-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataAnnotationTech/comments/16zteat/what_has_been_your_experience_like_working_for/k7u91i0/) (in reply to ID k7u7pbn):\nI took the starter test but sadly never heard back, and it's been two months since I've last done it.

Doing as wide of a variety as projects does a few things - it gets your foot in the door on more projects, it opens you up to that variety of projects and keeps you flexible, and it increases your overall productivity if you're really diving into these varied projects.

This is the place to discuss (or complain about) Data Annotation. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease be aware that we have been seeing unusual activity on our subreddit related to this company. There have been a swarm of new and inactive users mentioning both good and bad things about this company. We highly recommend being cautious and using good judgment when reading any of the comments below.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##FAQ\n\n**What is the website?**\n\nhttps://dataannotation.tech/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**How much does it pay?**\n\nIt depends on what tasks you do and how much work you have available. Their website claim that \"Most folks average $20+/hour\". However, there have been many reports of users earning as low as $10/hour.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Why don't I have any tasks?**\n\nYour best bet is contacting their support.

The sign up process has evolved slightly in the last few weeks as there's been increased interest, so apologies to the people that have gotten mixed signals. \n\nTo hopefully clear things up: once you take the starter assessment, we will email you if/when you pass. The review can take up to 2 weeks (roughly). There's no other action necessary on your part once you complete the starter assessment, and you don't need to refresh the site (again, we'll email you if you pass). Unfortunately we can't offer specific feedback on your starter assessment due to the high volume we're receiving. \n\nI hope this is somewhat useful!\n\n### Comment ID k63s5q8 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-10-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1356o7m/data_annotation_megathread/k63s5q8/) (in reply to ID jksw6jx):\nDoes the message “If we have need of your particular skills” mean the system automatically rejected us?

I don't want to doubt those people, and perhaps I just joined up at a rush of sign-ups and it's slow going, but all that praising of it, while many can't even find answers why we're just left wondering what's up, is making me feel like it's too good to be true.

Don't wish to offend anyone, but the skepticism is starting to creep in after waiting over a week and some have been waiting longer.\n\nI just want to know if it's backlogged and things are simply slow, and that I can chill and wait it out, or if I'm wasting my time waiting, because I wanted to use the money for a much needed pricy purchase.

I have you folks at beermoney to thank, because it was while doing my regular scan of the posts here that I first learned about data annotation. Now, I just want to pay it forward by encouraging others who may be hesitant about these types of opportunities to \"go for it\" with this site! I am so grateful to all of the people on beermoney who posted about it, or I may be still looking for the right remote job for me. I hope I can help someone else by posting about my experience.\n\nI myself have only just realized that this is, indeed, the real deal. I took the assessment on May 2 and on May 4, I made my first $40 with the site in what seemed like no time at all. I did several of the tasks that paid random amounts (8.00, 1.50, etc.) for what amounted to a max of 10 minutes of my time. I was excited to think that maybe I could earn some beer money from these folks. Little did I know the surprise to come! Most of the tasks that I did on that first day were qualification exams. I woke up on May 4 to an email that announced a new project I'd qualified for... this one pays $25/hour!\n \nLong story short, I've made over $800 with them since the 2nd of May. I could have made a lot more, but I kept waiting for the \"catch\", or to find out that it was a pain to get paid, etc. But that never happened! On the contrary, I made my first cash out of $176 last week, and I've got a lot more available now and coming in the next day or two. It does take anywhere from the full 3-7 days for most of the more lucrative tasks to pay out...just like a regular job, waiting on your paycheck! I still keep catching myself thinking, \"This is too good to be true!\", but that's only because I've been drug through the mud by a lot of other sites in my quest to find my dream work-from-home job. It's really this great! Good luck to everyone!  \n\nNote: If writing is not your strong suit, this may not be for you. All I do for them is write. I received an email that said that I had done great on my assessment within 24 hours. And it's been a steady stream of qualifications and/or projects every day since.

They even asked for a short story based on the most random mix of details possible and I took time to come up with something good that worked them all in. \n\nOnly recieved one qualification almost immediately after submitting it. And now here I wait, over a week later with a message that they'll email me if I passed. \n\nMaybe I didn't pass, but in that case why tease me with an immediate qualification? Having an apparent promotion to get positive posts on here is also kind of an unfair carrot on a stick for those of us left waiting in the dark. I'd LOVE to come home this afternoon and find it finally let me on, that I have a way of affording an expensive purchase I need, but if you were in after only just a couple of days then maybe those of us still waiting were rejected and they would rather ignore us and not offer any option to try again later.\n\n#### Comment ID jlx24ry with +1 score by [(Craft_feisty, Reddit, 2023-05-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1356o7m/data_annotation_megathread/jlx24ry/) (in reply to ID jkrymad):\n> I'd LOVE to come home this afternoon and find it finally let me on, that I have a way of affording an expensive purchase I need, but if you were in after only just a couple of days then maybe those of us still waiting were rejected and they would rather ignore us and not offer any op\n\nNew to the platform here, if its any consolation I had to wait 2 to 3 weeks after doing the initial signup test.

I did the first one no problem, and then I read through the guide, and then came back to do the second one, not realizing the second one was to read through the guide. So fine, I read through it again. Hit the submit button, and nothing was happening. So hit it a few more times, and finally it loaded and submitted. But oddly enough, it wasn't showing up under the Report Time section, which was part of the task. \n\nSo I thought I'd wait to see if it pops up. In the meantime, I completed the AI Chatbot qualification. After that, went to check if it showed up and it never did. And for some reason, it's not letting me complete the third onboarding task. So, I emailed support explaining this issue. I went to look at another qualification, but decided I was too tired to do it tonight, so exited out of that, figuring I'd do it in the morning. I come back to the site five minutes later, and now it's completely blank - the third onboarding and qualification are gone, and it's telling me I have no tasks and no qualifications at this time. \n\nNot sure if this is a glitch or what's going on, but I definitely don't have a good feeling about it :/ I was super excited to start doing this, it's perfect for me after having worked for years as a freelance writer/editor/transcriptionist. I don't see how I could have screwed up any of the onboarding tasks, there was really nothing to screw up, but I must have done something wrong sadly. From reading here, it seems like when this happens to people, it's almost like they turn a switch off on your account, indicating they no longer want you. Hoping that's not the case, but sigh.\n\n## Comment ID jirnl9g with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1356o7m/data_annotation_megathread/jirnl9g/) (in reply to ID 1356o7m):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID jirnw7d with +1 score by [(Positive_Role_7827, Reddit, 2023-05-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1356o7m/data_annotation_megathread/jirnw7d/) (in reply to ID jirnl9g):\nSame fix for me .

It’s been over a month since I’ve gotten any projects and I am concerned as to why.\n\nThere are also some qualification tasks and quizzes that I was unable to complete in the beginning when I first started after my starter assessment was approved due to unexpected health issues and they’ve since disappeared while I was recovering. Is there any way for you to check what those were and am I able to get them back on my dashboard so I can complete them or are they lost and gone forever with no way to retrieve them and the reason behind why I have not gotten any more projects?\n\nAdditionally, I do have one qualification on my dashboard that I am having trouble with, I clicked on it to see what kind of work it was but didn’t complete any tasks as I do not have any experience in computer programming whatsoever. However, it seems like there might be some sort of glitch because when I was initially reading the instructions for the qualification it entered work mode automatically on its own when the page first loaded and there is no option for me to exit out of work mode. As of writing this the timer is currently at 518:50:41 of 2:00:00 and there is no way for me to end it.

It took probably a month or so from signing up, taking the starter assessment, passing & doing qualifications to start regularly getting work. But once I did, the work never stopped coming. My dashboard is always at minimum half full but most days, it's full full. I get to choose when and what I want to work on. \n\nI've never seen pay below $20/hour besides task-based pay tasks. I've seen as high as $35/hour. \n\nDA has actually been an absolute blessing for me. It allowed me to afford some huge purchases this year that I wouldn't normally make. It is my bread and butter and I live mostly off of its income. I am very grateful! \n\nI really can't recommend it enough. I see a few people in here claiming DA \"paid\" them to write a good comment and I wish I could say they did, but no. I felt the least I could do is leave an honest review. \n\nThe only negative thing I can say is that if you happen to need supports help, it is a 50/50 tossup on whether or not they will actually respond to your email.\n\n## Comment ID jl7afab with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1356o7m/data_annotation_megathread/jl7afab/) (in reply to ID 1356o7m):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID jl7ss06 with +1 score by [(No_Resource7773, Reddit, 2023-05-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1356o7m/data_annotation_megathread/jl7ss06/) (in reply to ID jl7afab):\nShame.

I hope it helps answer some questions.\n\nI'm in the US. I applied on 5/2 and started earning on 5/4. I earned $47.33 the first day I was approved. There were just a couple of projects open to me initially, but I checked their page for qualification tests often and completed every one they offered. I did my best on every task I completed. My first cashout, on 5/14, was $143.14, and I received it the same day. I could have cashed out sooner but wanted to wait until I had built up a balance, plus there is a 7 day pending period on per-hour earnings to be redeemable.\n\nI told my son about DA, and he joined about a week later. His application was approved in two days as well, and his evolution appears identical to mine: he was offered a few projects at first, and eventually, after providing consistent, quality work, he was offered qualification tests that he apparently passed, because he was then offered more projects.\n\nI think there are two keys to getting approved.  The first is giving answers in the application that show you are fluent in English and can use proper spelling, punctuation, and grammar. I know that in a casual setting like Reddit, we (myself included) tend to be a little lazy in our writing, with sentence fragments, abbreviations, slang, and improper punctuation.\n\nBecause you're training AI, though, it is critically important that you're \"feeding it\" with proper English. If you have any doubt that you possess the above skills, there is no sense in applying for the job. They do not expect testers to be perfect -- the platform has Grammarly built in to help catch mistakes -- but if you were a C student in high school English, this job is not for you.\n\nThe second key, I believe, is for you to make your case in the open-ended application question about job skills that your skills and background make you perfect for this type of work. Flipping burgers for 6 months in high school does not qualify for this job. Don't lie and say you have fake job experience, fake skills, or a history in testing AI if that's untrue. If you have to fake your answers, you're not the person they're looking for.\n\nOnce approved, in order to be able to access more tasks, you have to give consistent, quality work. You have to be meticulous about every answer, whether it is a multiple choice question or an open-ended one. This work is not for everybody!\n\nSince my initial cashout, I have been banking my earnings for a big cashout. I currently have $1548.99 in lifetime earnings in the two weeks I've been working there. Subtracting my first cashout, it amounts to about $1406 either currently available or still within the 7-day pending period. The $1548.99 amount was almost entirely from hourly work, but I did a few individual tasks.\n\nTHIS IS NOT EASY MONEY. I have been working my tail off to give them thoughtful responses, analyzing every comma, and consulting a thesaurus if I had trouble thinking of the best word to use in an open-ended question. I've asked questions when I wasn't sure about something. I've erred on the side of reporting too FEW minutes of work on each project. They are putting their faith in me as a worker, and I want to reciprocate by giving them every penny's-worth they're paying for.\n\nTo answer a few questions I see repeatedly here:\n\n1. When I do qualification tests, they don't contact me to say if I passed or failed. If I passed, they will email and list on-site the projects now available to me.\n2. I was asked to do the background check after about 10 days of working hard on DA, having only cashed out once. The process was extremely fast and simple. The following day, I didn't get confirmation from DA that they received the results, but I had additional tasks available. It was perfectly fine for me personally to submit to the check and prove I'm not a serial killer; I think that was a valid request, but if you're iffy about it, don't do it -- it's as simple as that.\n\nIf after this diatribe anyone has any questions, I am happy to answer them if I can.\n\nu/JeremyDataAnnotation I hope this post is okay by you and the DA team.

Is PayPal the only way to get paid by this company?  When you did the background check, where were you sent to do it?  Was it a legitimate company/site?  How much personal information did you have to provide to sign up and honestly...what difference does it make to them if you are a serial killer?

You can specify any email to send the PayPal to; it doesn't have to be the same email as the one you used to join.  If I had to guess, I think it could be because PayPal is supposedly sending 1099s starting next year, and that would eliminate DA's need to do it themselves.  (This just pure conjecture on my part.)\n\nI was sent to Checkr to do the background check.  The reason they want to know if you are a criminal is because higher-level projects involve trying to prompt the AI to provide \"unsafe\" information like how to make a bomb or how to make meth.\n\nAs an update, my earnings between 5/4 and 7/6:  $10,992.52.

Sometimes companies like this have qualifying factors that have nothing to do with your skillset. For instance I worked for a company called Rev for years and then one day they just stopped employing Californians. I applied to 3Play media 4 times before someone did the kindness of telling me they don’t hire in CA and I was wasting my time. So I just wanted to let y’all know that it may have zero to do with your writing skills or how well you did on the assessment and more something with demographics. (I don’t know this with Data Annotation, I’m just filling in the gaps for those who are genuinely confused why they might not have heard back and feel confident they did well). That said- I did get a response within 24 hours and was able to make $100 in my first day. I am not trying to show off or brag or anything I just noticed from many other replies here that they seem to get back to people pretty quickly or not at all. Maybe if you’ve been left hanging for a long time re-apply with a different e-mail? I don’t know.

Some people got full access instantly same day without any manual human review of the assessment. This is like choosing favorites and others soft banning them from the platform. Imagine joining yourself and doing a starter assessment and getting nothing for weeks, while your friend joins and gets tons of tasks instantly same day and is making money each day while you having nothing for weeks and have no idea if you did anything wrong or a chance to improve I'm in the USA and did everything very carefully and till this for two weeks empty dashboard, while some newbies join hardly even a day with no experience in this field gain full access. I totally understand that the platform is growing but just does not seem fair the platform chooses favorites while throwing out others indefinitely with empty dashboards. Like I see some people here that joined last week and made $300 already while my dashboard is empty with no work or quals, there is no balance here and it's weird and questionable why the system works this way. Sorry for the long rant I'm just so confused as I saw people who joined recently and have been getting steady work from day 1! Also just letting you know nobody responds to support emails. I had some questions months ago and a week ago and nobody ever responds to it.  u/JeremyDataAnnotation\n\n### Comment ID jisg5kd with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1356o7m/data_annotation_megathread/jisg5kd/) (in reply to ID jiqsr67):\nI think the folks making the big money in a short amount of time are all assigned to projects that involve lots of reading and creative writing, so my guess would be that it has something to do with how well everyone tested in those areas.

I can't exactly say what you should write, because they have all different types of projects. Creative writing is definitely a big one and if you can present that you are a good writer in your bio, I'm sure that is a plus. I've had projects that included writing poetry, editing responses, creating my own characters and dialogue, writing creative stories, etc...the work is definitely there but I'd also emphasize any skills you have in working with tech and microtask-type sites.... Pretty much any experience with \"beermoney\" sites (most helpful here are probably if you've used sites like remotasks or mturk annotation tasks...), editing/proofreading skills are helpful, any experience in coding/programming...Python, Java, SEO, etc. gets you much higher paid tasks. I have experience on such a broad range work and otherwise life experiences that I just described every skill including the obscure (surprisingly, my work in childcare/Pre-K has been extremely helpful on one of my current projects with AI response, haha, who'd of thunk!). Just put it all out there, and be honest cause you might end up getting paired up with a project that's really fun for you, which is what they are hoping to achieve as part of the process, it seems to me. If you're able to get a project that interests you and is fun for you then you'll be more engaged and really work hard on the tasks. It seems like what most of the Admins are looking for, anyways! Although, all the different projects are run by different groups so don't get discouraged if you get one that has technical difficulties/weird instructions/bad communication. Also, communicate with the Admins and ask any questions if you have them. I remember at some point in my intro period they pointed out that folks that asked questions would be like possibly given more tasks? something like that?

Is it something compatible with a sit and stand still job?\n\nIf you could answer this questions I would really appreciate it!\n\n## Comment ID k687gnn with +1 score by [(Lumpy_Designer_9922, Reddit, 2023-10-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1356o7m/data_annotation_megathread/k687gnn/) (in reply to ID 1356o7m):\nHow is possible my starter assessment to disappear ? yesterday was there today is not :/\n\n### Comment ID k68jl70 with +1 score by [(Mesyaf, Reddit, 2023-10-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1356o7m/data_annotation_megathread/k68jl70/) (in reply to ID k687gnn):\nOuch .. should have submitted the test when you had the chance\n\n#### Comment ID k68kmea with +1 score by [(Lumpy_Designer_9922, Reddit, 2023-10-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1356o7m/data_annotation_megathread/k68kmea/) (in reply to ID k68jl70):\nI wasnt home :(  And to be more dramatic i was waiting this assessment 11 months.

This is an idea for people who want to work in their spare time or for a bit of side income. I have been working at  ([**DataAnnotation.Tech**](http://dataannotation.tech/)) for almost 2 years. You make money by the task or by the hour, depending on the project. They pay via PayPal. I have only worked very part-time in the past couple of years and am nearing the $3k mark. In all honesty, I quit for quite a while during my full-time job, but am back at it. I am currently working on two projects, one for $20 per hour and one for $25 per hour. I am making about $400-$500 a week. This is not permanent, as tasks come and go, but it is a great side income to work on if you needed extra work from a laptop or computer. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID jl47s6n with +16 score by [(Shnoorum, Reddit, 2023-05-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sidehustle/comments/13lwt44/data_annotation_tech/jl47s6n/) (in reply to ID 13lwt44):\nNot a huge fan of them.

Assuming you have regular workflow, could [DataAnnotation.tech](http://DataAnnotation.tech) actually provide reliable income? Or should you spread out your workflow to similar companies to ensure you have work readily available?\n\nI'm currently waiting to hear back from them, so not sure if I will even be able to work. \n\n## Comment ID m8ck0zu with +63 score by [(Dangerous_Darling, Reddit, 2025-01-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataAnnotationTech/comments/1i6iyf1/if_you_were_to_do_dataannotationtech_fulltime_how/m8ck0zu/) (in reply to ID 1i6iyf1):\nThis could end at any moment.

It depends on what projects you get access to and how much they pay, but assuming you're only doing $22/hr tasks, 40 hours a week, that's $45K/yr or about $32K/yr once you set aside for taxes. Remember though that you won't be spending all that money on gas driving to and from work. If you're getting access to higher paying \"core\" tasks, let's say $28/hr, then you could be making $40K/yr after taxes.\n\nThe issue is that it's *really difficult* for most people work 40 hours a week on DA tasks, because they tend to be mentally demanding.  There are some people who do work 50 or even 60 hours, but it's hard more likely that you'll have difficulty finding the energy to commit to over 30 hours.  And that might not be sufficient income for you if you want DA to be your sole source of income.\n\n## Comment ID m8ctv1s with +17 score by [(EitherCheck7210, Reddit, 2025-01-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataAnnotationTech/comments/1i6iyf1/if_you_were_to_do_dataannotationtech_fulltime_how/m8ctv1s/) (in reply to ID 1i6iyf1):\nFor the past 6 months, I've always had consistent work at $40-45/hr (within core) and of course the cheaper ones at $20-25/hr I've had since the beginning.\n\nBy full-time, I assume you mean 40 hr/week which would get me $83.2k before taxes per year if I work the full 40 every single week of the year at the $40/hr rate.\n\nThis is incredibly unreasonable, though, at least for me. With my other responsibilities outside of work, I would venture to guess I could make it about 6 high-quality hours a day for a total of 30 hours a week if I dedicated myself to this work alone. That would put me at $62.4k per year, again assuming I continue having access to the $40/hr projects every single week of the year.\n\nI think the biggest thing to consider is that the majority of these projects, no doubt the high-paying projects particularly, require a high level of focus which can quickly burn you out in just one full day's work. When quality goes down, chances of being booted goes up. Because of this risk, it's important to take breaks and evaluate your own work every so often to ensure you aren't slipping.\n\nA reasonable answer is going to differ for everyone. Some people will only be able to perform well at 4 hours a day, some maybe up to 10 hours but not every day. You'll need to perform an analysis on your own strengths and weaknesses to figure out what that number might be for you.\n\n### Comment ID m8g5q9z with +4 score by [(monsieurboks, Reddit, 2025-01-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataAnnotationTech/comments/1i6iyf1/if_you_were_to_do_dataannotationtech_fulltime_how/m8g5q9z/) (in reply to ID m8ctv1s):\nSame here, I've had seemingly infinite $45/hr maths tasks, would come out to $93.6k if I did it 40 hours per week all 52 weeks of the year.\n\nI do find it funny that I am earning way more hourly than my friends who have graduated into high finance roles doing silly olympiad style maths questions in bed\n\n#### Comment ID m8g6rif with +4 score by [(EitherCheck7210, Reddit, 2025-01-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataAnnotationTech/comments/1i6iyf1/if_you_were_to_do_dataannotationtech_fulltime_how/m8g6rif/) (in reply to ID m8g5q9z):\nYeah my degree has nothing to do with math but I enjoy this work way more than any job I can get with my degree, and these projects pay twice as much as my last job.\n\n### Comment ID m8fekwa with +2 score by [(Aware-Negotiation283, Reddit, 2025-01-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataAnnotationTech/comments/1i6iyf1/if_you_were_to_do_dataannotationtech_fulltime_how/m8fekwa/) (in reply to ID m8ctv1s):\nI've been wondering - is DAT coding work more intensive than a regular 9-5 in the same field?\n\n#### Comment ID m8fowcv with +2 score by [(EitherCheck7210, Reddit, 2025-01-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataAnnotationTech/comments/1i6iyf1/if_you_were_to_do_dataannotationtech_fulltime_how/m8fowcv/) (in reply to ID m8fekwa):\nI wouldn't know the answer to that because I cannot for the life of me learn coding lol.

At the driest, I’ve had like 2-3 projects I could work on at $20/h, at the most I tend to have 30+ projects from $20-$50/h. \n\nI’m in Canada, have bilingual French projects, and occasionally have Law expertise projects (used to be constant 45$ projects for me, but the main ones went away for me ~6months ago). \n\nI’ve always had another job because I could never put my trust in DA, but atm my job is moving cities and I don’t know if I’ll follow so I’ve been doing DA full time for almost a month. \n\nI think it also depends a lot what your income “needs” to be. The fact that the pay is USD and I’m in Canada already boosts things for me, and I live in a reasonably inexpensive city, lucky with my rent cost, etc. \n\nAlthough it’s true that we just never know and it could disappear at any point, the idea of full time/dependent on DA is more feasible for someone who needs to make a minimum of $500/week, maybe not so feasible for someone who needs $1000/week. It also depends on how much you can handle working. Even if project availability and pay easily allows for $1000/week, are you the kind of person that can sit, focus, and do sometimes tediously annoying, sometimes confusing work for 8 hours a day? It can be intense on the brain. \n\nGood luck on getting in.

This doesn't include the special projects that pay 1/3rd higher than the base advertised rate of $20 /h (anything $27+ isn't factored into this because I'm not sure how many people are shown those), so if you manage to get one of the projects spitting out that much, then your salary goes up much farther.\n\nAn extreme outlier would be a person from this Sub who did nothing but Core for well over 60+ hours a week, because he stated that he made over $10k in 2 months.\n\nIf you do get in, just remember that you have to balance both your work quality and work speed.. because although you can log as many hours doing DA work as your body can handle, you'll be kicked off the platform if your submissions are poor.\n\n## Comment ID m8cirbt with +2 score by [(LongjumpingHeron2007, Reddit, 2025-01-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataAnnotationTech/comments/1i6iyf1/if_you_were_to_do_dataannotationtech_fulltime_how/m8cirbt/) (in reply to ID 1i6iyf1):\nI have always had at least one project on my dashboard (over a year) and now regularly have work between $24-$27/hour, but I know that it could be gone at any moment, so I would likely want to be on more than one platform.

It requires a stupid amount of focus daily, many hours of sitting in the same place and staring at a screen, consistent quality output after hours of the same thing, and acceptance of all the downsides of freelancer life (healthcare, taxes, no coworkers if you enjoy having those, mostly working inside, unpredictable droughts). But if you enjoy the work and do very well, earning a comfortable amount a year in core is entirely possible for LCOL areas (and possibly MCOL?).

I failed miserably at first because the clock just freaked me out on the qualifications.\n\nI still don't know how to do qualification tests correctly. If I take the time to do them right the option to submit is gone by the time I submit my work.\n\nSo I just smash through them to try and click submit before others have completed them. I usually fail at that as well.\n\nI was removed from all but one project and I was grateful for it and I really did my best. If I wasn't doing a good job, I just logged off so I didn't waste their time.\n\nThey gradually put me on more projects without any qualification test, and I performed them perfectly I think.\n\nSo I maybe am not the best, but I really try to do perfect work. I always re-read the project instructions before I start and check the slack channel for updates.\n\nI set all my bookmarks to sites that help me do a better job and I track myself with clockify.\n\nThis is a wonderful company and I'm grateful for them. I just wish they would let me finish the qualification before they turn it off. I don't think I'm slow,sometimes they vanish in less than 5 minutes.\n\nBut I am very austere on myself and the work I submit. I try to watch tutorials online to get better at it and improve my work.\n\n### Comment ID k1w6z03 with +10 score by [(Comfortable-Order811, Reddit, 2023-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataannotation/comments/16fce12/how_long_have_you_been_on_dataannotation_how_many/k1w6z03/) (in reply to ID k01jb8n):\nThis is overkill, no?\n\n### Comment ID m6ga7sx with +2 score by [(nokamdo, Reddit, 2025-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataannotation/comments/16fce12/how_long_have_you_been_on_dataannotation_how_many/m6ga7sx/) (in reply to ID k01jb8n):\nI appreciate you sharing your real experience.

I've been working basically everyday since the beginning of September, I didn't get \\*that\\* many projects but some of them had an enormous number of tasks to complete, so some days I was able to do up to 7h of work.

      "# [Side Hustle or Scam? What to Know About Data Annotation Work by Will Henshall on 2024-04-02](https://time.com/6962608/data-annotation-legit-tech-jobs-ai/)\nOn TikTok, Reddit, and elsewhere, posts are popping up from users claiming they’re making $20 per hour—or more—completing small tasks in their spare time on sites such as DataAnnotation.tech, Taskup.ai, Remotasks, and Amazon Mechanical Turk.\n\nAs companies have rushed to build AI models, the demand for “data annotation” and “data labeling” work has increased. Workers complete tasks such as writing and coding, which tech companies then use to develop artificial intelligence systems, which are trained using large numbers of example data points. Some models require all of their input data to be labeled by humans, a technique referred to as “supervised learning.” And while “unsupervised learning,” in which AI models are fed unlabeled data, is becoming increasingly popular, AI systems trained using unsupervised learning still often require a final step involving data labeled by humans.\n\nThere are no precise estimates of how many people engage in data annotation work. A 2022 Google Research paper approximates the number to be in the millions, and that in future that could grow to be billions. A 2021 study estimated that 163 million people have made profiles on online labor platforms, 14 million of whom have obtained work through the platform at least once, and 3.3 million of whom have completed at least 10 projects or earned at least $1,000. (Though this number is likely to be an overestimate for data annotation, because not all work carried out on online labor platforms is data annotation work.)\n\nData annotation sites, often subsidiaries of larger companies, can offer legitimate avenues for earning money. As the AI industry continues to grow, demand for human labellers has grown with it. But potential users should be aware that the data labeling industry is poorly regulated, and because the industry is opaque, it can be difficult to navigate. Here’s what to know.\n\nHow does someone get started in data annotation?\n\nTo qualify for the programs, workers must begin by completing an assessment. The duration of the initial assessment can vary, but users commonly report times as short as an hour and as long as three hours. If a user passes the assessment, they should start to receive invitations for paid work through the site. If the user isn’t accepted into the program, they typically don’t hear anything after completion of the assessment.\n\nTasks on the assessment can vary in nature. There is a trend towards more highly-skilled data annotation work, says Sonam Jindal, who leads the AI, Labor and the Economy program at the Partnership on AI, a nonprofit. “We're going to start seeing that as you have a need to have higher quality AI models, you also need higher quality data,” she says. “We can figure out if something is a cat or a dog, that's great. Moving on to more advanced tasks—to have more advanced AI that is useful in more specialized real world scenarios—you will need more specialized skill sets for that.”\n\nHow much money does the work pay?\n\nIn the U.S., sites often offer around $20 per hour for tasks such as labeling photos and completing writing exercises. More specialized data annotation work can provide higher pay. For example, DataAnnotation.tech offers $40 for coding tasks, and Outlier.ai offers $60 per hour for chemistry tasks.\n\nOutside of the U.S., data labellers are typically paid a lot less, says Jindal. But despite the higher price tag, there are reasons companies may prefer U.S.-based workers, such as tasks that require specific cultural knowledge or skills that are prevalent in the U.S.\n\nWhat have people’s experiences been like?\n\nOn online discussion boards, users report a wide range of experiences with data annotation work. Many describe positive experiences—straightforward onboarding processes, an ample supply of tasks, and good pay.\n\n“I have been working at [DataAnnotation.Tech] for almost 2 years,” one user writes. “You make money by the task or by the hour, depending on the project. They pay via PayPal. I have only worked very part-time in the past couple of years and am nearing the $3k mark. In all honesty, I quit for quite a while during my full-time job, but am back at it. I am currently working on two projects, one for $20 per hour and one for $25 per hour. I am making about $400-$500 a week. This is not permanent, as tasks come and go, but it is a great side income to work on if you needed extra work from a laptop or computer.”\n\nRead More: The Workers Behind AI Rarely See Its Rewards. This Indian Startup Wants to Fix That\n\nBut some report less positive experiences, such as being told they had passed the assessment, but then never being offered any tasks. More worryingly, some users report their accounts being deactivated with large amounts of earnings yet to be paid out. One user writes that their account was deactivated with $2,869 worth of work unpaid, and that they emailed the companies' support contacts, but did not hear back.\n\nData annotation sites often use algorithmic management to keep their costs low, which can result in the poor treatment that many workers experience, says Milagros Miceli, who leads the Data, Algorithmic Systems, and Ethics research group at Weizenbaum-Institut in Berlin. And because the data annotation industry is poorly regulated, companies rarely face consequences for substandard treatment of workers, she says.\n\nWhat is the data used for?\n\nSome companies, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and Upwork, operate in a relatively transparent manner, with the same brand for both purchasers of data labeling labor and for workers. But others don’t. Remotasks is the worker-facing subsidiary of data labeling provider Scale AI, a multi-billion dollar San Francisco-based business with clients including OpenAI, Meta, and the U.S. military. Similarly, Taskup.ai, DataAnnotation.tech, and Gethybrid.io are reportedly subsidiaries of Surge AI, another data labeling provider that serves clients including Anthropic and Microsoft.\n\nCompanies say that this secrecy is required to protect sensitive commercial information, such as new product development plans, from leaking, says Miceli. But they also prefer secrecy because it reduces the chances that they will be linked to potentially exploitative conditions, such as low wages and exposure to traumatic content.\n\nA Scale AI spokesperson directed TIME to a blog post that says that Remotasks was established as separate to Scale AI to protect customer confidentiality and cites examples of steps Scale AI has taken to ensure workers are treated fairly. The spokesperson also said that “Remotasks does not engage in projects that require exposure to sensitive images / videos, and in the event such content appears in a dataset it can be reported and removed from the workstream.”\n\nSurge AI, Taskup.ai, DataAnnotation.tech, and Gethybrid.io did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.\n\nData work is fundamentally undervalued, argues Jindal, suggesting that data workers could be paid royalties on the products that they help create.\n\n“Their knowledge and information is being captured in data and used to train these AI models that are called artificial intelligence,” she says. “It's actually their human intelligence—our collective human intelligence—that's being embedded in these models.”",
      "# [College student training AI says the meeting-free work can pay up to $30 an hour and is 'perfect for an introvert' by Sarah Perkel on 2025-02-19](https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-tutor-data-annotator-hourly-pay-fully-remote-contract-work-2025-2)\nRiley Willis sits behind his keyboard for 30 hours a week. When he clocks out on Saturday, he's completed his shifts without speaking with a soul.\n\nWillis is an AI contractor, working in data annotation through a company called DataAnnotation Tech. He said his job is fully remote and he operates asynchronously — with no set boss, no contact with coworkers, and no daily meetings.\n\n\"It's perfect for an introvert,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nWillis said his days consist of \"fact-checking\" the output of various AI models — but only because that's what he chooses to take on. He said DataAnnotation Tech offers a variety of projects for contract workers to choose from, including teaching artificial intelligence to improve its creative writing and coding skills.\n\n\"You are literally going through and you're labeling the information based on a series of criteria that differ between projects,\" Willis said. \"I personally work on a lot of factual stuff, just because I just find the pay-to-effort ratio is nice. So there's a lot of fact-checking responses, making sure the models aren't lying or hallucinating information.\"\n\nAs companies continue the push to improve their AI models, there's been a corresponding spike in demand for data annotators and labelers. Workers in the field spend their time either \"generating data for training\" or \"labeling data for training,\" Willis said, completing tasks in programming, writing, and research.\n\nWillis said he was drawn to the job when he was looking to move out of his parents' house.\n\n\"I wanted a job that wasn't customer service or anything like that,\" he said. \"I was already doing remote school, so I was kind of already comfortable with the remote environment.\"\n\nWhen he was onboarded, Willis was making $20 an hour, he said, but now he nets about $25. Hourly rates vary depending on the projects workers take on, and Willis said he'd seen them reach as high as $30.\n\nDespite not taking on a full-time workload, Willis, who is pursuing a bachelor's in computer science through the University of Florida's online program, said he could fully cover his expenses — including tuition and rent in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\n\"I can pay rent, and I can pay my way through college,\" Willis said. \"It's not like I have a lot of spending money in the end, especially if I'm not working 40 hours, full-time kind of stuff, but I have enough where I can live generally.\"\n\nWillis said his frugal lifestyle allowed him to stretch his pay, adding that he \"couldn't support himself\" if he were living alone.\n\n\"I live poor, honestly,\" he said. \"If I had some extravagant lifestyle — if I went out to, you know, bars and everything and spent a lot online — I probably couldn't do it. But just getting through my day, it completely covers it.\"\n\nThe job does have its drawbacks. Willis said the repetitive nature of the tasks could be \"mind-numbing.\" And unlike a full-time position, Willis gets paid only for the time he's sitting down at his computer actively working on assignments.\n\n\"Even in a high-paced job, I feel like, you know, there's paid lunch breaks, stuff like that,\" he said. \"Or, you know, you spend a second or two talking to someone, but you're still on the clock getting paid. With this, you're really not getting paid unless you are doing the work.\"\n\nWillis said he sometimes spends \"six or seven hours\" on research but gets paid for only about \"five hours of actual work\" because of his need to pause occasionally. But Willis said the pros of the job outweigh the cons.\n\n\"I will personally say work-life balance is nice, in the sense that, obviously, it's remote and I can work whenever I want,\" he said. \"I can work at 1 o'clock in the morning if I really feel like it.\"\n\nFor someone who's looking for a side hustle to tack on to their full-time role, Willis said working to train AI might be the way to go.\n\n\"I think this would be really, really good for someone who has an actual job and is doing this, like, two hours a day,\" he said. \"I think this is really what this kind of setup shines in. If you have an actual full-time job, and you just add the extra hour, hour and a half a day earning an extra $25 to $50 a day, just when you have nothing else to do, is definitely doable.\"",

      "# [Remote Jobs and Freelance Gigs by Smridhi Malhotra on 2024-11-02](https://www.zimbola.com/best-outlier-ai-jobs-alternatives-to-make-money-with-ai-remote-tasks-jobs-freelance-gigs)\nOutlier AI jobs have gained immense popularity since the time people posted stories and reviews about how they have been making money as AI trainers.

These have been covered comprehensively in my other posts on Outlier AI review and how to gain more tasks on the platform to boost your earnings. Due to the challenges faced by Outlier employees like empty queues, no QMs responding, and delayed payment, it is understandable that you are tired of waiting and decide to give up working on the platform and look for Outlier AI alternatives.\n\nAs the AI industry is rapidly growing, there are many emerging AI companies like Outlier that provide opportunities in the AI field to remote workers and freelancers. But, are they offering gigs consistently or stable jobs at higher pay compared to Outlier? It is difficult to say because AI is a developing field and under the experimental stage where pay varies greatly and jobs are not as stable as expected.

Appen works with many big companies like Amazon, Pinterest, Microsoft, Adobe, LinkedIn, and Google to train their AI models. It aims to bring AI innovation and shape the future of AI. Being in business for more than 25 years, it provides precise and trustworthy solutions by adding power to AI interactions.\n\nAppen has a global presence and has recently gained popularity for making inroads in the AI world. In terms of work opportunities at Appen AI, Appen projects will help you make sufficient money provided you are well-qualified and ready to devote a good amount of time to the platform.\n\nThe jobs on Outlier AI alternative Appen are usually simple to perform. You have to gather and collect information and interpret the information based on your observations. For testing the platform and reviewing Appen, I registered through the website. After clearing online tests, I saw that the job board had very few AI projects to work on. I worked on a new project called LionBridge that had some AI model training tasks. The tasks were simple, not highly paying but doable in a quick time.\n\nAppen remote and freelance jobs provide three types of tasks:\n\nData Collector\n\nResearcher\n\nCreate Datasets\n\nDepending on the educational qualification, location, and other factors, the average salary ranges from $9 for researchers and $30 for data collectors. Final verdict - Appen is better than Outlier AI so you can register here and try it yourself. Appen is a good choice and I call it a top Outlier AI alternative.\n\nTop blog to read - The new list - Best prompt engineering courses and certifications\n\nMust read - DIY Guide to Fix ChatGPT login problems\n\n2. DataAnnotation Tech\n\nDataAnnotation Tech is another new Outlier AI alternative. It is a job website that has emerged as the demand for building AI models goes up and many regard it as a good alternative to Outlier AI jobs. Workers are hired to do coding and writing work. After you submit the tasks, the tech companies use it to create AI systems. The work is consistent because the AI industry is expanding and there is a huge demand for human labelers and annotators.\n\nData Annotation jobs are legit and offer revenue earnings to the workers. The average data annotation pay of an employee in the U.S. is $20 per hour. The tasks are not steady but if you stay consistent, you get some tasks every month.\n\nThe work is easy and sometimes you feel that you are being paid for doing nothing. But there’s a catch. The $20 average hourly pay is not for everyone. It entirely depends on your education level, years of experience, ability to handle various kinds of tasks, location, etc. So in the end, the pay might not really excite you. This is a situation similar to that of the Outlier AI platform. It’s an Outlier AI alternative, the work type and pay will remain largely the same.\n\nOn the other hand, you must know your account on Data Annotation Tech is not permanent. The company is very strict about following the instructions. If your work is not up to the mark, your account will be deactivated by DataAnnotation Tech AI jobs.\n\nThe best comparison article - Copyleaks vs Originality AI fake content detection tools\n\n3. OneForma - Aggregator model Outlier AI alternative\n\nOneForma is a remote job and freelancing gigs site that works as a job aggregator model in the AI niche. On OneForma, you can apply to various AI jobs posted by different companies listed there. If you are selected, the job is monitored by OneForma. You get paid from the platform from the very first task you do for the company you have been selected by.\n\nIt’s one of the best Outlier AI alternatives because there is real work from reputed brands and the job variety is large. It offers a variety of opportunities like transcription, translation, content labeling, grading, and conducting surveys. The remote and flexible work opportunity helps you to increase your earnings and gain experience in the AI industry. Once you join the OneForma community, the work starts rolling in, you can apply for multiple jobs and get payments for the approved tasks on the 10th or 25th of every month.\n\nIn case you are confused OneForma is real or fake and whether it really can be an Outlier AI alternative, the answer is simple. OneForma is legit and a top alterntiave for Outlier AI jobs. You get payments on time and you can contact the Support team if in case you do not get the payment transferred on committed time. You get emails regarding the urgency of work, and new projects lined up.\n\nThe downside is again the same as the Outlier AI jobs platform and others - the platform is crowded. This means there are too many applicants for every job. On the bright side, due to the wide range of jobs available, you can get regular work and good pay. It all depends on how you can stand out from the crowd.\n\nThe training period is lengthy but not confusing like Outlier AI jobs because they are very specific and follow a proper structure. And, the training material includes a lot of guides, and information to grasp that you might feel if it is worth your time. On the positive side of this Outlier AI alternative, you learn and gain experience in how to train LLMs and make good money online. It is location-specific as some areas receive more workload than others. For some remote workers on OneForma, the workflow has been continuous and they get new tasks every day, with some making around $500 every week. It’s really a good choice if you are looking for Outlier AI alternatives.\n\nAI review to read - Jasper content writing - Does it really work and clears the AI checkers?\n\n4. WeLocalize - Good for freelancing gigs in AI field\n\nWeLocalize is one of the top choices for remote workers looking for an Outlier AI alternative. It’s a leading company that provides premium services in 250 languages. The company is adept in providing translation, localization, and adaptation services to more than 40,000 countries worldwide. The professional team at Welocalize specializes in improving customer engagement by fuelling it with local content.\n\nThe team at this Outlier AI alternative is expanding and is seeking freelance remote workers in the AI field. You can work for WeLocalize as an AI service provider, data annotation, AI data rater, AI ads quality rater, and some other roles in multiple languages. Regarding Welocalize is legit or fake, well, it’s legit.\n\nApplications are invited by the company regularly and once your application gets the green signal from the hiring team, you receive the training material. Although, it is time-consuming as the wait time is unspecified. It could be 2, 5, or even 3 weeks to finally onboard WeLocalize.\n\nWeLocalize, the Outlier AI alternative, promises to offer bonuses if you clear the entry exam. Some WeLocalize reviews claim that the company sticks to its commitment and pays a $270 extra bonus for successfully completing the onboarding tasks but that’s unverified. The work is subjective and you will have to follow many rules.\n\nThe assessment test is divided into portions and you get access only when you complete the first one. Once cleared, you are paid for it (as stated in the mail). If everything goes well, you are connected to a regional manager and might receive a list of important contacts.\n\nThe reviewers are strict as they do not compromise on quality. The pay is not rewarding as compared to the amount of work you will do so whether WeLocalize is a good Outlier AI alternative or not depends on your expectations. Overall, the pay and the lengthy process at various stages will overwhelm you so be prepared for that.\n\nMust-read blog for digital marketers - How AI content is ruining your SEO goals\n\n5. Alignerr - The AI startup challenging Outlier\n\nAlognerr is an AI startup that offers similar kinds of AI jobs like Outlier. Alignerr is a big community where you work as a subject expert. Just like Outlier AI jobs, once hired, you guide AI models in several disciplines. The pay is good and at some locations, you can start at $45-$60 hr, which is fairly good considering that not many AI training platforms pay in that range for their remote work and freelance gigs.\n\nThe working time for tasks is 6 to 7 hours per week depending on the tasks availability. Every person who has worked on this Outlier AI alternative has a different experience to share. You get to work on different projects which means that you get paid only for the projects that you work on. This cannot be your full-time job for sure. The process at Alignerr AI jobs keeps changing and you get regular updates about it.\n\nCurrently, roles like generalist, linguist, and coding are in high demand. If you face errors, the support team of Allignerr is working to fix as this is what you get as a response when you look for an online solution. Overall, yes, it is an Outlier AI alternative but I have to hold back before calling it a promising option for remote workers and freelancers looking for consistent jobs and good pay.\n\nVerdict - The top Outlier AI alternatives\n\nWorking for any of the platforms that are Outlier AI alternatives, like Appen, DataAnnotation Tech, WeLocalize, and others, can get you consistent tasks and decent pay but that’s about it. If the tasks are simple, the pay is too low - as little as just $2 for a couple of hours job. And if the tasks are difficult, then the pay is high but the number of tasks can work on is very few.\n\nTo sum it up, a couple of options like OneForma and Appen are good Outlier AI alternatives if you are looking for AI remote work but the scope of earning big is not high at all. Before you start working for Outlier AI or any of its alternatives, be sure of the per-gig pay they offer and the time it takes to complete a task.
