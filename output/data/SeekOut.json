This reduction in workforce may reflect internal challenges or market adjustments [(TechCrunch, 2024-05-26)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/20/seekout-layoffs-30percent-talent-search-tigerglobal/). The layoffs were reported by multiple sources, including GeekWire and The Business Journals [(GeekWire, 2024-05-26)](https://www.geekwire.com/2024/recruiting-software-company-seekout-lays-off-employees-in-another-round-of-cuts/) [(The Business Journals, 2024-05-26)](https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2024/05/21/seekout-layoffs-recruiting-tech.html).\n\n## Product Innovations\n\nSeekOut has introduced several innovations, including SeekOut Spot, which uses agentic AI to significantly reduce the time from job description to qualified candidates, reportedly from 45 days to just three. This innovation allows recruiters to focus on strategic tasks while the AI handles labor-intensive aspects of candidate sourcing [(Garnick, Madrona, 2025-04-24)](https://www.madrona.com/rise-of-agentic-ai-in-recruiting-seekout-anoop-gupta/).\n\n## Funding and Valuation\n\nSeekOut has raised a total of $186 million in funding, with its most recent Series C round in January 2022 raising $115 million and valuing the company at $1.2 billion [(Tracxn, 2021-08-17)](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/seekout/__i3sDeHa60YW_vCWOVbkli4cYFfYw_SwnS8SNT1DP8Iw).\n\n## Market Position\n\nSeekOut is a key player in the talent intelligence market, competing with 33 active competitors, including Bryq and Cangrade.

However, the recent reduction in employee count may raise questions about internal challenges or market adjustments [(SeekOut, 2024-12-18)](https://www.seekout.com/blog/strategic-interview-questions-to-ask-candidates).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSeekOut is positioned as a leader in the AI-driven recruitment space, with a strong focus on talent intelligence and innovative solutions like SeekOut Spot.

The SeekOut services also include performing candidate sourcing and recruiting services for prospective employers. SeekOut is committed to data privacy and protection as a core value and governing principle for our company.\n\nThis Privacy Policy explains how ZipStorm, Inc. d/b/a SeekOut (“SeekOut”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and shares personal information in order to create, maintain, and update the SeekOut Candidate Database and provide sourcing and recruiting services, and how you can exercise your privacy rights with respect to the personal information we collect. In addition to the SeekOut Candidate Database and sourcing and recruiting services, this Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you visit our websites, including www.seekout.com, applications, and online services provided by us in connection with SeekOut; apply for a job with us; or when you otherwise interact with us (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to data we process as a service provider on behalf of our customers. For information about the privacy practices of our customers or to exercise your rights with respect to such data, please consult their privacy policies.\n\nIn this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual. For the purposes of European data protection law, SeekOut is the data controller of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n1. Personal Information We Collect\n\nThe personal information we collect depends on how you interact with our Services.\n\nInformation You Provide to Us\n\nIf you use of our Services, you may be asked to voluntarily provide personal information when you:\n\naccess or use our Services, including a demo/trial;\n\nmake a request to receive information about our Services;\n\ncontact our sales team or customer support team; or\n\nattend one of our marketing events or webinars.\n\nThe personal information we collect may include your first and last name, job title, company name, email address, phone number, account password, search terms (including keywords and filter values), and any personal information contained in customer support requests.\n\nInformation Collected Automatically\n\nIf you use our Services we may automatically collect personal information from your device, including:\n\nLog Information:\n\nIncluding browser type and settings, access times, pages viewed, your IP address, and the page you visited before navigating to our websites.\n\nDevice Information:\n\nIncluding the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information related to your computer or mobile device.\n\nLocation Information:\n\nApproximate location derived from your IP address.\n\nUsage Information:\n\nIncluding the content you view, features you use, the frequency and duration of your activities.\n\nCookies and Other Tracking Technologies: SeekOut and our service providers may collect personal information about your browser and device using various technologies, such as cookies and web beacons. We use cookies (small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory) to count visits and traffic sources, see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and customize your browsing experience. We use web beacons (electronic images or pixels) to help deliver cookies, count visits, understand website usage, and measure marketing campaign effectiveness. You may disable the use of such cookies at any time by using your browser settings.\n\nSeekOut maintains the SeekOut Candidate Database, which is primarily comprised of publicly available vocational information about a job candidate’s employment history, qualifications, and education. SeekOut licenses this publicly available information about job candidates from third-party data providers and stores that information in the SeekOut Candidate Database. If you have a professional profile on a publicly available website, we may license that information from our third-party data providers. Our third-party data providers may also collect information you have provided publicly on vocational websites, and our third-party data providers may also provide us with your contact information. The personal information we license may include your name, contact information, education, professional qualifications, work history, work title, and experience. We do not collect information such as job references or appraisal details. We also do not collect sensitive data (e.g., health, political affiliation) from any of these sites. We regularly update this information to ensure accuracy.\n\nWe use machine learning-powered functionality to infer other likely characteristics about job candidates in the SeekOut Candidate Database (e.g., our product uses binary machine learning classifiers to predict the likelihood of someone moving to a new role based on years at a company, years in a role, etc.) so that recruiters and hiring managers can be more targeted when approaching candidates. We also use this machine learning-powered functionality to make an inference of the demographic status of a candidate, including gender, race, ethnicity, and/or country of origin, using attributes extracted from candidate profiles (e.g., from first and last names, the country where they attended university, service in the armed forces, etc.). These inferences help recruiters easily find highly qualified and diverse candidates.\n\nWe use inferences to enable certain optional search filters within the SeekOut Candidate Database and candidate pipeline insights. Recruiters may elect to use these optional search filters and insights while searching within the SeekOut Candidate Database to find highly qualified and diverse candidates. Inferences are not stored on a candidate’s profile within the SeekOut Candidate Database, and inferences are not available for export outside of the SeekOut Candidate Database. Inferences about race or ethnic origin could be interpreted as sensitive personal information under some privacy laws. We voluntarily provide you with the ability to opt out of the use of this personal information, as outlined in the “Your Rights and Choices” section of this Privacy Policy.\n\nProspective employers may engage us to source and recruit qualified candidates for open job opportunities. We refer to these services as “SeekOut Spot.” To provide the SeekOut Spot services, we collect data about potential job candidates from the SeekOut Candidate Database, information licensed from other companies, and interactions between candidates and our recruiters. This data includes name, contact information, education, professional qualifications, work history, work title, and experience, as well as inferred information.\n\nSeekOut Job Applicants\n\nIf you apply to work for SeekOut, attend a recruitment event, or otherwise participate in the SeekOut recruitment process, we may collect and process personal information about you. The personal information we collect may include your name, email address, phone number, home address, employment history, education, qualifications, and any other information provided in your application materials. We may also collect information about you from third-party sources, such as recruitment agencies, referrals, references, or background checks.\n\nAs part of your application, you may provide information relating to your gender, race, ethnic origin, physical or mental health, or criminal records.\n\nIf your application is unsuccessful, SeekOut may still retain and use the personal information you provide to us for a reasonable period of time to handle issues that may arise in connection with your application, to contact you regarding other employment opportunities, and for SeekOut's legitimate business purposes.\n\nInformation Collected About Children\n\nWe do not knowingly collect any personal information directly from children under the age of 18. If we discover we have received any personal information from a child under the age of 18, we will take reasonable steps to delete that information as quickly as possible. If you find information on SeekOut about anyone under the age of 16, please contact us at privacy@seekout.com.\n\n2.

      "# [AI Agents for Recruiting: A Guide for Hiring Teams by SeekOut on 2025-04-10](https://www.seekout.com/blog/ai-agents-for-recruiting)\nAs a recruiter, you’re no stranger to the constant ebb and flow of hiring. Just as one role wraps up, another lands on your plate. You might have an offer out to a promising candidate only to have them back out or disappear without a word. Sourcing can feel endless, and even with AI tools built into your process, the weight of keeping it all moving still falls on you.\n\nNow imagine if the most repetitive parts of your job, like screening resumes or sourcing candidates, could run smoothly in the background. The tedious work is handled for you, and you’re still in control of the moments that call for human judgment and connection. That’s the promise of AI agents for recruiting: they adapt in real time, take initiative, and free you up to focus on talent strategy.\n\nWhat used to sound like science fiction (or at least a distant possibility) is now woven into daily hiring workflows. Agentic AI in talent acquisition isn’t on the horizon—it’s here. And it’s already changing how teams source, screen, and hire at scale.\n\nWhat are AI agents for recruiting?\n\nAI agents are programs that use agentic AI, which is a newer form of artificial intelligence designed to work toward goals without needing constant input. While agentic AI refers to the intelligence that powers decision-making and adaptability, AI agents are the tools that apply this intelligence to real-world tasks.\n\nIn recruiting, this means AI agents go beyond the simple tasks of sorting resumes or drafting emails. They can actively search for candidates, send personalized messages, schedule interviews, and refine their approach on the fly.\n\nHere’s what sets agentic AI in hiring apart:\n\nAutonomy: AI agents don’t need step-by-step instructions. They can source candidates, schedule interviews, and progress tasks on their own.\n\nDecision-making: They analyze candidate data, prioritize outreach, and pivot when needed.\n\nAdaptability: As they gather feedback from recruiters and observe candidate behavior, AI agents learn and get better at hitting hiring goals.\n\nAI in talent acquisition has come a long way. We started with early machine learning that could spot patterns. Then came generative AI, which could create content. Now, agentic AI marks the next leap—one where technology takes action.\n\nAgentic AI vs. other AI models in talent acquisition\n\nUntil recently, AI in recruiting has mainly supported singular tasks, like surfacing candidates, drafting job descriptions, and sending automated follow-ups. Tools powered by machine learning or generative AI have been helpful but limited. They respond to input and are reactive by design.\n\nLet’s say you’re writing a job description. A traditional AI tool might analyze past hiring data and recommend top candidates using filters, such as years of experience or location. That’s helpful, but agentic AI goes a step further—it screens resumes, pinpoints high-potential candidates, initiates outreach, and updates job criteria according to what’s working in the hiring process.\n\nThe same goes for interview follow-ups. While generative AI can help you draft a message, an AI agent can write the email, send it, track whether it’s opened, follow up with a more tailored note, and schedule the interview without you lifting a finger.\n\nHere’s how that plays out across key tasks in the recruiting process:\n\nIn each of these scenarios, machine learning and generative AI offer support up to a point, but agentic AI actually does the work. This shift frees up your team to spend less time on repetitive tasks and more time building relationships and making strategic hiring decisions.\n\nWhy are AI agents for recruiting a breakthrough?\n\nYou’ve probably seen your fair share of AI tools claiming to make recruiting easier. But too often, they just tack on a few shortcuts and leave you to juggle the same long list of tasks. An AI agent changes that. From the moment you log in, your workflow looks and feels different.\n\nWith agentic AI by your side, here’s what shifts:\n\nNo more micromanaging tools\n\nAI agents don’t need handholding. Once they understand the goal—say, filling a role with five years of experience in a specific market—they jump into action. You’re no longer bouncing between job boards, adjusting filters, or tracking candidate lists manually.\n\nThe AI agent is already:\n\nsearching across platforms, including niche networks.\n\nreaching out to promising candidates.\n\ntweaking its search using early feedback.\n\nYou still have control, but you’re not in the weeds pushing every button.\n\nMore time for meaningful conversations\n\nWhen the busy work is off your plate, you get to spend your time on the parts of recruiting that require a human touch.\n\nInstead of squeezing in interviews between calendar coordination, you get to:\n\nspend more time preparing for conversations.\n\npersonalize your outreach in ways that resonate.\n\nsupport hiring managers with thoughtful coaching.\n\nThat reclaimed time is your opportunity to double down on candidate experience, which is where human connection still matters most.\n\nSmarter processes without the extra effort\n\nEvery task your AI agent completes, whether it’s a follow-up email or a rescheduled interview, feeds into its learning. Over time, it starts to understand the nuances of your roles, your industry, and your candidate pool.\n\nFor example, maybe candidates in a certain market respond better to early morning messages. Your AI agent will notice that trend and adjust its timing automatically with no reminders or reprogramming needed. As you dedicate time to making connections, a continuous improvement occurs behind the scenes.\n\nHow should I use AI agents for recruiting?\n\nYou don’t need to tear down your current process to start using agentic AI for recruiting. The best approach is to layer it into places where it can take the biggest load off your plate. Think of an AI agent as your teammate who handles the repetitive work.\n\nHere’s where agentic AI can make the most impact:\n\nSource smarter without the endless scroll\n\nEven the best recruiters have limits on hours in a day, platforms you can search, and profiles you can reasonably review. AI agents in hiring source deeper and wider than a human ever could, scanning thousands of profiles across job boards, professional communities, and niche networks in minutes.\n\nMachine learning and generative AI models rely on specific algorithms and prompts—think complex Boolean searches. But agentic AI can evaluate work history, growth patterns, and career moves to surface strong-fit candidates who may not have popped up otherwise.\n\nScreen candidates through a wider lens\n\nForget keyword matching and hoping your ATS gets it right. With agentic AI for talent acquisition, screening becomes smarter and more aligned with your actual hiring goals.\n\nThese AI systems can apply a custom rubric—like your team’s definition of “What Good Looks Like”—to evaluate candidates based on what truly matters for the role. That might include technical experience, career trajectory, or specific accomplishments, not just title or tenure.\n\nAs a human recruiter gives feedback on which candidates move forward, the AI learns and refines its shortlist, so that each slate better meets your expectations.\n\nPersonalize outreach at scale\n\nIt’s easy to lose personalization in candidate outreach when doing it manually or using generic templates, but with AI agents for recruiting, that’s no longer an issue. These systems tailor messages to each individual and draw on their experience, interests, and activity across platforms. They’re written to bypass the “junk” folder and increase the chances of a response.\n\nHere’s an example of an initial outreach email using agentic AI:\n\nAgentic AI can also test different messaging styles, track engagement, and follow up automatically if someone doesn’t reply. You're still in control of the messaging, but you're not spending hours copying, pasting, and editing emails.\n\nContinuous optimization you don’t have to manage\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of agentic AI for HR is that it learns as it goes. As you hire, pass, or provide input, the system tracks patterns and adjusts its approach. This ultimately gives you more bandwidth to review candidates who fit the role.\n\nBecause they learn from real outcomes, AI agents for recruiting can also help reduce unconscious bias and surface candidates who may otherwise be overlooked. If your team is scaling quickly, navigating a hard-to-fill role, or hiring outside your typical expertise, AI agents ensure you make headway so you can keep your focus on the bigger picture.\n\nHow SeekOut balances AI agents with human oversight\n\nAI is changing the way teams recruit, but it’s not replacing the people behind the process. At SeekOut, we believe the best results come from blending the speed and agility of AI with the judgment, empathy, and experience humans bring to the table.\n\nWith SeekOut Spot, our end-to-end recruiting service our expert human recruiters work alongside AI agents. While AI agents do the legwork on sourcing, screening, and personalized outreach, a dedicated SeekOut recruiter interprets results and keeps the process centered on finding the right fit.\n\nFor many busy teams, learning how to use advanced tools like agentic AI requires time and resources that aren’t available. Spot removes these barriers and gives you access to advanced recruiting technology without a learning curve or hefty price tag. At the same time, you get a Spot recruiter to guide decisions throughout the process.\n\nThe collaboration starts with a 30-minute kickoff meeting. You and your SeekOut Spot recruiter align on role requirements, capturing the must-haves, nice-to-haves, and any context that defines success for the position.\n\nFrom there, Spot’s agentic AI gets to work. On day one, it generates a What Good Looks Like (WGLL) rubric using your input. This rubric becomes the foundation for evaluating thousands of profiles for deep signals, including work history, career trajectory, and relevant experience.\n\nOnce you approve the rubric, the AI performs candidate research by sourcing broadly and evaluating potential matches at scale. By days two and three, Spot’s AI agent begins personalized outreach with multi-step, tailored engagement to connect with candidates.\n\nIn as little as two weeks, your Spot recruiter uses their extensive recruiting experience to screen candidates for fit and confirm interest. They then present you with a slate of high-quality candidates who are aligned with your goals and ready to move forward.\n\nPutting agentic AI into practice\n\nWhen hiring ramps up, it’s easy to fall behind, especially if your team is juggling multiple roles with limited time. SeekOut Spot was built for those moments. Whether you're in the middle of a hiring surge or just don’t have the bandwidth to manage everything in-house, it helps you stay agile without sacrificing quality.\n\nWith Spot, a dedicated SeekOut recruiter acts as an extension of your team. They bring in the human insight and hiring expertise, and AI agents handle the time-consuming tasks.\n\nIf you're looking for a way to source deeper, screen smarter, and keep your hiring process on track, an AI agent for recruiting may be worth exploring.",
      "# [Data-driven Diversity: 4 Ways Your Team Can Start 2021 on the Right Path by SeekOut on 2020-12-14](https://www.seekout.com/blog/data-driven-diversity-4-ways-your-team-can-start-2021-on-the-right-path)\nDiversity and inclusion are top of mind for many company leaders today. It’s the right thing to do to combat social injustice, and research has shown that diverse teams perform better overall. But finding more diverse candidates to interview is one of the biggest barriers to improving diversity.\n\nData can help. In fact, 81 percent of attendees on a recent webinar agreed it would be helpful to have diversity statistics for setting and achieving goals. However, 91 percent said they had difficulty finding the statistics they needed.\n\nThe right data can help you and your team think more strategically about how to approach diversity hiring in 2021.\n\n1. Setting realistic diversity targets\n\nIt’s common for HR leaders to be given corporate diversity targets, but they may not always be realistic. Taking a more proactive approach with data can help you get a seat at the table while goals are being discussed and set.\n\nUnderstand your talent pool demographics by looking at your competitors’ demographic data, as well as regional demographic data. Compare that to your own data to find opportunities to improve. For example, if 3 percent of your workforce is comprised of Black employees, but 10 percent of your regional population are Black, consider how you might better attract and retain Black workers.\n\nBreak down demographic data by seniority, discipline, and specific roles to find exactly where you should focus your diversity recruitment efforts. For example, if your competitor and regional data show a higher percentage of Black software engineers than you have on your team, you will know you have a strong opportunity to hire more talent from that group.\n\n2. Strategically advising hiring managers to craft better job requirements\n\nA Hewlett Packard internal report found that men apply for a job when they meet 60 percent of the qualifications, but women apply only if they meet 100 percent of them. Your hiring managers may be inadvertently derailing your diversity recruiting efforts with long lists of must-have skills and qualifications.\n\nEmpower your talent acquisition team to have data-driven conversations around job requirements, so they can become true strategic advisors to your hiring managers. For example, they can show how the original job requirements yielded only 50 candidates across the country, with only a handful from underrepresented groups. By removing unnecessary skill, location, or title requirements, they can show hiring managers how to access a larger, more diverse talent pool.\n\n3. Strategically sourcing and submitting diverse slates\n\nTraditionally, sourcers have uncovered candidates from underrepresented groups by building Boolean strings based on where diverse people are. But many of these strings aren’t accurate—and may even introduce bias. For example, searching the top 100 US female names finds less than 20 percent of women, and those women will be predominately white. A quarter of Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) students aren’t Black, and only 9 percent of Black college students attend HBCUs.\n\nDig into your data to see where candidates from underrepresented groups are coming from, and use that to refine your sourcing strategy. For instance, what companies have they worked for, where are they located, and what colleges did they attend? Help your team go beyond traditionally-used search strings by investing in sourcing platforms that use data and AI to accurately find candidates from underrepresented groups, and reduce bias.\n\nAnd when hiring managers submit slates to hiring managers, encourage them to include at least two women and two minorities. Studies have shown that a more diverse slate of candidates increases the probability of hiring someone from an underrepresented group.\n\n4. Diagnosing bottlenecks in the talent funnel\n\nFinally, use data to uncover breakdowns in your talent funnel. Is there a stage where candidates from underrepresented groups are disproportionately screened out of your hiring process? Is your turnover rate higher for employees from underrepresented groups?\n\nDiagnosing pitfalls in your talent funnel can guide you toward solutions. For example, blind resume reviews can reduce bias early in the process, while structured interviews and assessments can reduce bias later on.\n\nBut simply hiring a candidate from an underrepresented group doesn’t help you build a more diverse workforce if you can’t retain them. Keep a pulse on why employees are leaving, so you can provide more transparency in the hiring process—or move to enact change.\n\nFinal thoughts on data-driven diversity\n\nThere is a great opportunity for your team to leverage data and insights to set diversity targets, become talent advisors to your hiring managers, and achieve or exceed your targets. But increasing representation at the top of your talent funnel is only part of the equation.\n\nCandidates from underrepresented groups should feel included, and know that their different personal experiences and ways of thinking are accepted and celebrated. Diversity, inclusion, and belonging are all very important, and need to be thought about concurrently to achieve true progress and better outcomes.\n\nReady to build a more talented, diverse team?

      "# [Recruiting Email Templates that Engage Passive Candidates by SeekOut on 2025-04-22](https://www.seekout.com/blog/recruitment-email-templates)\nMost recruiting emails get ignored, and it's easy to understand why. When someone isn’t job searching, your message becomes just another advertisement in the abyss. If your outreach doesn’t catch both the inbox filter and the reader’s eye, it often disappears before it’s even opened.\n\nAbout 70% of the workforce are passive candidates. These professionals aren’t checking job boards, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t open to the right opportunity. The challenge is grabbing their attention without sounding like every other recruiter reaching out.\n\nStrong recruiting email templates can offer a foundation for you to build from. The key is to use them as starting points instead of copy-and-paste scripts. With initial email response rates sitting between 30 and 50%, reaching the higher end (or exceeding it) requires thoughtful, personalized messaging.\n\nYour choice of words, your tone, and how you connect with the person behind the profile all make a real difference.\n\nCommon recruiting email template mistakes\n\nBelow are common mistakes that can tank your outreach before it even starts:\n\nUsing the wrong email address\n\nMany recruiters rely on default communication channels like LinkedIn InMail, but response rates there continue to drop. Candidates receive multiple InMails a week, and many admit they rarely check that inbox at all.\n\nIf your message ends up in a dormant account or secondary inbox, it doesn’t matter how personalized or compelling it is. To improve your delivery rate, start with better contact data. SeekOut Recruit offers access to verified email addresses, making it easy to reach passive candidates through the channels they actually use.\n\nIf your team needs more support, SeekOut Spot’s fully managed service option takes it even further with a dedicated recruiter and agentic AI working together to bring you a slate of qualified, interested candidates.\n\nSounding like a recruiter email template\n\nIt might seem counterintuitive, but the most effective recruiting email templates don’t feel like templates at all.\n\nIf your message opens with a generic line and jumps straight into a job description, most candidates will stop reading. Passive candidates aren’t scanning their inbox looking for opportunities. If your email feels like it was sent to a list instead of a person, it won’t spark interest.\n\nUse templates as a foundation but always add a human touch. Even one personalized detail can increase your chances of getting a response.\n\nAsking for too much too soon\n\nIf your first message asks a passive candidate to send a resume or fill out an application, you’re probably asking too much.\n\nKeep the initial outreach low-pressure. Your goal is to open the door, not close the deal.\n\nA simple call-to-action, like confirming if they’re open to hearing more, makes it easier for candidates to engage without committing to anything upfront. A clear, one-sentence CTA that only asks for interest or permission to follow up is often all you need to keep the conversation going.\n\nWhat makes a great email template for recruiters?\n\nNow that you know what not to do, let’s focus on what makes a recruiting email worth reading and responding to.\n\nMost candidates don’t have the time or interest to figure out if a message is relevant. If you want their attention, your email needs to answer one simple question: “What’s in it for me?”\n\nHere’s what separates the best recruiting emails from the ones that get ignored:\n\nFocusing on the candidate\n\nInstead of starting with what the company needs, start with what the candidate might care about. What’s in it for them? Highlight what makes the role appealing, whether that’s the team they’d join, the flexibility offered, or how the work connects to their background.\n\nIncluding real details\n\nA vague title and “great opportunity” won’t help someone decide if it’s worth a conversation. Include the basics: role, location or remote option, pay range, team structure, and a brief note about what makes the position unique.\n\nMaking it personal\n\nEven if you’re using a recruiting email template, it should read like you took a moment to learn about the person you’re contacting. Mention their current company, a skill they’ve listed, or something from their background that shows you’re not sending the same message to everyone.\n\nEnding with a clear ask\n\nIf your call to action requires too much effort, most people won’t respond. Avoid asking for resumes or including scheduling links in the first message. Instead, try something simple like:\n\nWould you be open to a quick intro chat?\n\nCan I share more about the role?\n\nWould sometime this week work to connect?\n\nBonus tip: Don't stop at one email\n\nEven when you craft your recruiting email templates perfectly, most people won’t respond to your first email. But that’s not a sign you’ve done something wrong, it just means they’re busy or unsure if it’s worth their time. That’s why it helps to think beyond one message. A short follow-up sequence gives you more chances to catch someone at the right moment. Across 4 or 5 emails, you can highlight different aspects of the role, keep the tone low-pressure, and remind the candidate why you reached out to them specifically. Just make sure each message is targeted and adds value.\n\nEmail subject line strategies that grab attention\n\nWhen it comes to getting a response, your lead-in makes all the difference. The subject line is the first thing your candidate sees, and it's often the reason they decide to open your message. Passive candidates receive dozens of emails a day, so your subject line needs to stand out. The most effective cold email subject lines follow one of three approaches:\n\nHighlight the candidate’s strengths\n\nChildren’s author Arnold Lobel said that “nothing is harder to resist than a bit of flattery.” That’s why subject lines like, “Impressive experience” or “Loved your project at [Company]” work because they tap into the human desire to feel valued. Even well-worn phrases can stand out when they’re authentic and specific.\n\nHere are some subject line examples:\n\nYour work on the Mercury pricing model rollout was seriously impressive\n\nReally liked how you approached customer churn at Brightwave\n\nYou’ve built something solid at Finlogic—wanted to connect\n\nShow you did your homework\n\nPersonalization signals effort, and effort earns attention. If you know the candidate’s location, interests, or background, include it in the subject line. With SeekOut Recruit's power filters, you can search by interests and more.\n\nFor example, if you’re searching for a Senior Financial Analyst in New York, you can refine your results down to candidates who attended a top 50 university and have an interest in reading.\n\nThen, your subject line can be something like:\n\n\"Thinking in Bets is a UVA alum’s work. Have you read it?\"\n\nYour email's intro could then be:\n\n“Hi Janet, I noticed you went to the same school as one of my favorite writers, Annie Duke. She wrote Thinking in Bets, which talks about how sharp analysts approach risk, and it made me think of a role we’re hiring for that could be a great fit for you.”\n\nYou’re not inviting them to book club, but you’re showing that you noticed something beyond their title and skills. Personalizing subject lines can help you stand out from the dozens of generic messages they’re used to.\n\nSpark curiosity\n\nAvoid subject lines that give everything away. If your message reads like a job posting before it's even opened, you’re giving passive candidates a reason to skip it. Instead, aim for subject lines that hint at value without spelling it out, such as:\n\nA finance role that fits how you think about risk\n\nYour work at Redbridge Capital made me want to reach out\n\nA new opportunity that lines up with your background in finance\n\nThe goal here isn’t to be vague but to make the recipient curious enough to open the email and learn more.\n\nHow to personalize recruiter email templates at scale\n\n89% of senior marketers agree that personalization works, but when you're reaching out to dozens—or even hundreds—of passive candidates, writing one-to-one messages for everyone isn’t realistic.\n\nThe key is learning how to personalize at scale. You don’t need to reinvent the wheel for every message. A few smart adjustments can make a bulk email feel like it was written just for the reader.\n\nHere are four fields you can easily tailor in your recruiting email templates:\n\nName: This is non-negotiable. You can use it in the subject line and the body.\n\nLocation: Mentioning the candidate’s city or region shows you’re paying attention. For example: “I’m currently looking for top engineering talent in Boston.”\n\nJob Title or Company: Referencing their role or employer adds relevance. Try: “I know [Company] is known for strong design leadership, which is why I wanted to connect.”\n\nInterests: If the candidate’s profile mentions something unique—like reading, travel, or golf—mention it. For example: “Saw you’re into golf. Ever played Pound Ridge?”\n\nPlatforms like SeekOut Recruit make this easier by helping you surface these details quickly. But if your team doesn’t have time to sort through filters and manually adjust messages, SeekOut Spot can take this off your plate entirely.\n\nWith SeekOut Spot, an expert recruiter works with you to understand your hiring goals and must-haves. Using Spot’s agentic AI, they search broadly, dig deep, and personalize outreach based on candidate traits. Then, they provide you with a curated list of highly qualified candidates.\n\nBonus tip: Make it easy to respond\n\nMost candidates will read your message on their phone. That means long paragraphs, requests for resumes, and “when are you free to chat?” messages usually get ignored.\n\nInstead, write with mobile behavior in mind. Keep the ask simple. A one-click or one-word reply is far more likely to get a response than a complicated scheduling request.\n\nHere’s an example of a mobile-friendly call-to-action: “If I don’t hear back here, I’ll try giving you a quick call around lunchtime on Wednesday. If there’s a better time, feel free to reply and let me know.”\n\nThis approach works because you take the initiative to suggest a time, you leave the door open for them to adjust it, and you set the expectation that a follow-up is coming.\n\nBest cold email templates for recruiters with examples\n\nCold recruiting emails work best when they’re adapted to the person you’re reaching out to. Below are example templates you can adjust to fit different outreach scenarios—each designed to help you start meaningful conversations with passive candidates.\n\nPassive candidate outreach with personalization\n\nThis template uses location and interests to personalize the message in a way that feels human and specific. It leads with recognition and closes with a simple ask, making it easy for the candidate to reply without pressure.\n\nSubject: Opportunity in [Location] + a team that values [Trait or Interest]\n\nHi [First Name],\n\nI came across your profile while sourcing [Job Titles] in [City] and was impressed by your work at [Candidate Company] and your interest in [Interest].

On the surface leadership espouses how much they care about culture and gratitude, but under the covers they protect and even participate in belittling, undermining, disrespecting, and cutthroat behaviors. They believe they are better than everyone else and never look in the mirror at the destruction and pain they are wreaking in almost all areas of the company. The insidious part is that they hide their behavior behind the excuse of having “high standards” and every attempt to call attention to their behavior is twisted into blaming those that speak up. All who try to change things for the better are systematically discredited and discarded. You’ll learn about the long history of victims that have gone through this when you join. When you look at the quality of the product you’ll understand that they are actually not competent at leading a team that can build a great product or support great sales and CS teams. Overall this place could be great. They operate in an interesting product space and have some great people working there, but the fact that leadership not only fails to protect its employees from the toxicity, but protects and rewards it, is unacceptable. Everyone should avoid this place unless looking for an immersive lesson in workplace toxicity.",

All of the issues can be traced back to top-level leadership that lacks any semblance of strategy, accountability, and basic humanity. Bullying behavior from the CEO and leaders in his inner circle were not only allowed, but rewarded with promotions. Incompetent VPs micromanaged every detail of downstream teams, severely hindering autonomy and productivity.\n\nBackstabbing, demeaning language, and blaming others were a common occurrence. Every team across the organization was aware of the problems, but leadership instilled a culture of fear and retaliation. Well-meaning employees who surfaced concerns were ignored and/or punished with public humiliation, more work, or simply fired.\n\nLeadership's definition of 'product strategy' was copying our competitors, or straight up lying to customers about what the product does to close a sale, leaving other teams in a horrible position to scramble and try and deliver on impossible promises. Gaslighting happened at every level, with priorities constantly changing, and lower-level employees blamed for the misdirection. \n\nThe result of this impossibly toxic culture? Dissatisfied customers, multiple quarters of missed growth targets, constant turnover of high-performing employees, and 3 major layoffs in less than 1.5yrs. This company is literally burning to the ground, and the leaders have nobody to blame but themselves. But it's highly unlikely that group of cowards are brave enough to look in the mirror and take any accountability.",

SeekOut is the first early stage startup I've worked with where this feeling is absent... and yet the active, dynamic, productive, and fun environment that is such an allure of startups is woven into the DNA of the company, even through a pandemic, where the only interaction is through Zoom and Teams calls. \r\n\r\nFrom a sales perspective, the compensation structure is fair and clearly laid out. Additionally, while it's a relatively complex SaaS sales process, the product is of such high quality (and in such high demand), that customers not only end up purchasing and renewing, but they want to be sure their whole team has access. Of course, the possibility for this kind of expansion is aided by the fact that we have a super attentive and knowledgeable Customer Success team.\r\n\r\nUltimately though, the primary quality that stands above the rest is the integrity of each person on the SeekOut team, and the bar for this is set at the top with Anoop and the four other members of our founding team.",

The company has successfully adapted to a fully remote working environment and remains very collaborative. We have a strong, diverse team that feels very inclusive.

SeekOut's focus appears to be scattered due to a \"do everything\" mentality, resulting in a lack of direction. SeekOut does not consistently utilize its own product when searching for new hires, which may indicate a lack of faith in the effectiveness of their own platform. SeekOut's intense commitment to a new product is questionable, as there seems to be minimal interest from potential buyers.",

Numerous bugs remain unresolved because the engineering team is stretched to its limits.\nGTM Strategy is practically non-existent, further hampering the success.\nRecently, the company went through a second round of reductions in force, resulting in the loss of many talented individuals who were not fairly compensated upon their departure.\nThe company claims to prioritize a people-centric culture, with Anoop (CEO) often emphasizing this value. While he may genuinely believe in this vision, the reality is starkly different. Employees are treated poorly, and it’s clear that the company's actions do not align with its stated values.\nDespite selling a product for internal mobility, the company fails to provide such opportunities for its own employees.\nQuestionable Diversity and Inclusion Practices: While the company boasts about its diversity and inclusion initiatives, it cannot claim true diversity by merely hiring women for traditionally female-occupied roles.\nDue to these ongoing issues, I am actually actively seeking new job opportunities.",

I am not a senior employee or even a manager of any kind, so I think I have a rather unbiased view. The leadership at SeekOut is in a very difficult spot; they expected the hyper-growth of 2021 to continue, over-hired for that scenario, and then were met with a dramatically changed market. Something had to change and this change has been painful. But I have nothing but the utmost respect for many of our senior leaders and know them to be good leaders and good people. The changes we’re going through are necessary, and though the future outlook is not clear, we have a very real chance of turning this company into something incredible.\n\nDon’t come to SeekOut expecting a smooth ride to an imminent public offering, but do come to SeekOut expecting real ownership in your work and the chance to write the story of a promising company with a wonderful group of people.

Additionally, while it's a relatively complex SaaS sales process, the product is of such high quality (and in such high demand), that customers not only end up purchasing and renewing, but they want to be sure their whole team has access. Of course, the possibility for this kind of expansion is aided by the fact that we have a super attentive and knowledgeable Customer Success team.\r\n\r\nUltimately though, the primary quality that stands above the rest is the integrity of each person on the SeekOut team, and the bar for this is set at the top with Anoop and the four other members of our founding team.",

All of the issues can be traced back to top-level leadership that lacks any semblance of strategy, accountability, and basic humanity. Bullying behavior from the CEO and leaders in his inner circle were not only allowed, but rewarded with promotions. Incompetent VPs micromanaged every detail of downstream teams, severely hindering autonomy and productivity.\n\nBackstabbing, demeaning language, and blaming others were a common occurrence. Every team across the organization was aware of the problems, but leadership instilled a culture of fear and retaliation. Well-meaning employees who surfaced concerns were ignored and/or punished with public humiliation, more work, or simply fired.\n\nLeadership's definition of 'product strategy' was copying our competitors, or straight up lying to customers about what the product does to close a sale, leaving other teams in a horrible position to scramble and try and deliver on impossible promises. Gaslighting happened at every level, with priorities constantly changing, and lower-level employees blamed for the misdirection. \n\nThe result of this impossibly toxic culture? Dissatisfied customers, multiple quarters of missed growth targets, constant turnover of high-performing employees, and 3 major layoffs in less than 1.5yrs. This company is literally burning to the ground, and the leaders have nobody to blame but themselves. But it's highly unlikely that group of cowards are brave enough to look in the mirror and take any accountability.",

I am not a senior employee or even a manager of any kind, so I think I have a rather unbiased view. The leadership at SeekOut is in a very difficult spot; they expected the hyper-growth of 2021 to continue, over-hired for that scenario, and then were met with a dramatically changed market. Something had to change and this change has been painful. But I have nothing but the utmost respect for many of our senior leaders and know them to be good leaders and good people. The changes we’re going through are necessary, and though the future outlook is not clear, we have a very real chance of turning this company into something incredible.\n\nDon’t come to SeekOut expecting a smooth ride to an imminent public offering, but do come to SeekOut expecting real ownership in your work and the chance to write the story of a promising company with a wonderful group of people.

      "# [An Intro to Talent Intelligence: How It Works and How to Profit From It by SeekOut on 2024-07-16](https://www.seekout.com/blog/introduction-talent-intelligence)\nThe talent landscape has shifted rapidly over the last several years. Employee churn rates are high, the skills shortage keeps growing, and AI has become so sophisticated that talent teams can gather more data than they know what do to with. With so many challenges in motion, it’s easy to understand why organizations are struggling to hire and retain a workforce that supports their business goals—but talent intelligence could be the way through.\n\nIn this overview, you’ll learn what talent intelligence is and why CHROs and talent leaders are leveraging it to hire smarter, keep their high-performing talent, and keep their talent adaptable to any changes that come their way.\n\nWhat is talent intelligence?\n\nTalent intelligence is the process of collecting, analyzing, and operationalizing data that stems from internal and external talent pools, including those of competitors like market insights. For example, organizations can collect data from a variety of sources around diversity hiring efforts, sourcing efficiency, nurture engagement, retention rates, internal hiring, and employee satisfaction scores. They can then use this data in its entirety to make informed, actionable decisions around their short- and long-term talent roadmaps.\n\nTalent intelligence empowers CHROS and talent leaders to make data-driven decisions about their hiring and retention strategies and tie them closely to business impact.\n\nWhy is talent intelligence important to an organization’s success?\n\nThe talent function has historically been separated into two pillars: talent acquisition and talent management. Talent acquisition is often the pillar that organizations focus on the most, while talent management is treated as a nice-to-have. In today’s unpredictable talent landscape, this fragmented approach to talent strategy is outdated. Businesses are losing high-performing talent to competitors and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to hire talent with needed skills.\n\nTo stay competitive and relevant with their employees and candidates, organizations need a comprehensive approach to their talent where talent acquisition and talent management no longer exist separately. Talent intelligence offers this unified view, bringing together employee data and external talent pool data to enable teams to plan for immediate needs and evolve with future needs of the business.\n\nA key here is that talent intelligence helps organizations understand their existing workforce so they can mobilize the talent they already have when business priorities change. Tapping into your employees—who already have intimate knowledge of your business or product—can solve the stickiest of talent issues much faster than continually hiring externally when it may not be necessary. Organizations can approach short-term needs (e.g., this employee with this specialty skill fits this open role) and long-term needs (e.g., can this employee learn this skill to start this crucial role in six months?) with more intention and efficiency.\n\nExamples of questions that talent intelligence can help answer\n\nWithout the right data available, talent teams suffer from a lack of knowledge that prevents their strategies from evolving. Organizations remain stagnant or scramble to keep up with evolving needs, which impedes their path to becoming an employer of choice where people want to work and stay for years to come. Talent intelligence helps teams get to the root of their toughest challenges by providing insight into questions such as:\n\nWhere do I have a skills gap?\n\nWhat are adjacent skills for this role?\n\nHow engaged are employees?\n\nWho is at risk of leaving the organization?\n\nWhat roles are in high demand within the organization and at similar or competitor companies?\n\nWhat makes candidates choose or reject potential employers?\n\nWhat pay range and benefits are being offered for similar roles in the market?\n\nWhat role expectations do similar companies have from candidates?\n\nHow are similar organizations approaching culture, social justice, equity, and other intangible benefits?\n\nWhat are the role-specific and organization-wide benchmarks for metrics such as time to fill, cost per hire, turnover rates, and time to productivity?\n\nWhat recruiting channels are best suited for each type of role in the industry?\n\nWhere do the best candidates come from?\n\nWhy do employees quit?\n\nWhat retention methods are the most effective in the industry?\n\nWhat sort of opportunities do employees look for after leaving my company?\n\nTalent intelligence helps organizations refine and innovate their strategies to remain agile, forward-thinking, and competitive with candidates and existing employees.\n\nWhat data sources feed talent intelligence?\n\nThe data that informs talent intelligence typically comes from five sources:\n\n1. Recruiting platforms\n\nA candidate’s first interaction with potential employers is typically captured across recruiting solutions. If you’re using an AI-assisted solution, you can further analyze recruitment data captured through candidate profiles on professional and social networks, resumes, interview data, offer acceptance, and past interactions.\n\n2. Background verification\n\nBackground verification reports provide data on candidates and their past employers. This is ideal for role-specific insights into past pay, responsibilities, and job expectations.\n\n3. Core HR solutions\n\nCore HR solutions or HCM (Human Capital Management) platforms can offer an in-depth look into an organization's internal talent. For example: payroll information, data of last promotions, time spent in the role and the organization, performance metrics and impact, exits and qualitative data around exit interviews, and absenteeism.\n\n4. Job boards and aggregation sites\n\nIndustry-relevant job boards and aggregator sites like Glassdoor can provide insight into labor market trends, helping you to establish benchmarks on salary ranges, job responsibilities, number of openings and applicants, competitor reviews, and job descriptions.\n\nIn addition to quantifiable data, you can gather information on the type of candidates who typically apply for specific roles. Organizations can use this data to fine-tune their messaging and craft inclusive job descriptions to build diverse candidate pipelines.\n\n5. ATS and employee networks\n\nApplicant tracking systems and employee networks gather data around diverse candidates who already have a connection to the organization. This data can be used to expand the sourcing funnel and create more opportunities to diversify the talent pool.\n\nTalent intelligence platforms: How to leverage talent data\n\nThere’s so much talent data available—that much is clear—but how can talent teams best capture it all to guide strategy? Talent intelligence platforms like SeekOut can integrate with various data sources and merge all that information into one platform that can be analyzed and acted upon.\n\nPowered by AI, these platforms provide insights based on thousands of data points captured throughout the candidate and employee journey. For your recruiters, talent intelligence platforms are the best resource to uplevel their role into trusted talent advisors to your organization.\n\nDevelop existing talent to better support your business goals\n\nTalent intelligence platforms help to create a cultivated internal mobility process by giving employers deep insight into employee performance and satisfaction.\n\nRecruiters and HR leaders can identify high performers and at-risk employees, enabling them to promote, reward, recognize, and retain people who have an outsized impact on the business. CHROs and talent leaders can further analyze this data to understand why employees may want to quit or understand the drivers of high-performance to mitigate attrition and build on growth.\n\nInternal talent data also informs more strategic decisions around crucial questions, such as:\n\nAre underrepresented employees being provided with enough opportunities to grow?\n\nIs the executive team diverse enough?\n\nIs the organization supporting employees’ individual ambitions and needs?\n\nTalent intelligence gives a competitive advantage to organizations that use it to refine their hiring process. It brings the most passionate and qualified people to the organization in the shortest amount of time and allows you to understand how to keep them there.\n\nHire better-qualified candidates with richer insights into their abilities\n\nTraditional sourcing relies heavily on job titles and keywords, which can limit the scope of profiles that match. For example, searching “Java Developer” will miss candidates who don’t have the exact keyword in their resume. Results can also include poor matches where the keyword may exist, but the candidate doesn’t have the required skills or aptitude for the role.\n\nPlatform capabilities like AI talent matching go beyond keywords and job titles to offer a more holistic view of candidates’ skills and experience. This is because AI has a much wider “understanding” of the search context. With a better understanding of the candidate’s breadth of skills and capabilities, recruiters can improve the quality of candidate interactions and shorten time-to-fill because they’re not wasting efforts speaking with anyone who is underqualified or uninterested.\n\nRe-engage with former candidates to shorten the hiring cycle\n\nA major pitfall of sourcing platforms is that past resumes and silver medalist candidates are often overlooked. Over the years, organizations amass thousands of resumes that get lost once a role is filled. When the position opens again in the future, recruiters start the process all over again.\n\nTraditional platforms aren’t designed to reassess past applicants, but talent intelligence platforms “learn” to discover qualified candidates from the pool of past applicants. With AI, these platforms are constantly refreshing data, so not only can you surface relevant candidates who applied for a role in the past, but you’ll also have access to their most up-to-date qualifications and work history.\n\nSigns to invest in talent intelligence platform\n\nGiven the shifting talent environment, the time to unify your talent strategy is now. But there are some tell-tale signs your organization needs a talent intelligence platform:\n\nIncreasing turnover rates\n\nLonger hiring times\n\nDeclining employee engagement and commitment\n\nHigher cost of recruitment\n\nThese continued challenges hint that your traditional methods are becoming obsolete and it’s time to update them. A data-driven approach with talent intelligence will help you directly solve these challenges:\n\nStay ahead of labor market trends to fill roles faster.\n\nPerform strategic workforce and succession planning to build, buy, or borrow talent and fulfill your company strategy with more accuracy.\n\nSupport internal talent mobility to keep high-performing people\n\nOvercome skills gaps faster to keep innovation moving forward.\n\nIf any of these challenges resonate with you, it’s worth at least exploring talent intelligence platforms to further understand how one can help your business’s specific needs and provide the right ROI.\n\nHow to assess a talent intelligence platform",
      "# [15+ Strategic Interview Questions to Ask Candidates by SeekOut on 2024-12-18](https://www.seekout.com/blog/strategic-interview-questions-to-ask-candidates)\nAsking the right candidate interview questions is essential to hiring someone who not only has the required skills and experience but also whose career aspirations match what your organization can offer. You have a short amount of time to speak with someone, so your questions should yield answers that reveal two things: One, how successful the candidate will be in the role, and two, how the candidate’s goals, interests, communication skills, and values line up with your organization.\n\nTo get you started, below are 15+ strategic interview questions to ask candidates throughout various stages of the interview process, whether you're a recruiter or a member of the hiring team.\n\nDownload this list: Strategic Interview Questions to Ask Candidates PDF\n\nThe type of questions you ask a candidate will depend on the role (i.e., what you ask a software engineer will be quite different than what you ask a marketing manager). However, you can ask non-role-specific questions to help you better understand the candidate’s approach to work and the general skills they possess (e.g., problem-solving skills and communication).\n\nTo compile this list of questions to ask a candidate in an interview, we asked two SeekOut recruiters for their favorites, and we got some help from Laszlo Bock, former Google Senior Vice President of People Operations. You’ll also find a few questions submitted by our talent community.\n\nStrategic questions to assess role and company alignment\n\nThe following are good interview questions to ask a candidate at the beginning stages of the process. These are commonly asked by the recruiter during the screening stage, but anyone throughout the interview loop will find these helpful.\n\n1. Can you walk me through your experience at a high level?\n\nWhy this question is strategic. \"This question seems straightforward, but candidates can struggle telling their story and how it relates to the role they are interviewing for,\" says Andy Pietromonaco, former Senior Recruiter at SeekOut. \"This question assesses how well-versed the candidate is in their field, how much research they have done about the company and the role, and how well they can craft their response to an audience.\"\n\nWhat to look for in a candidate’s answer. Andy says to listen for the candidate’s ability to concisely provide a career summary. They should be able to highlight bullet points of their experience and directly align them with what's listed in the job description.\n\n2. What piqued your interest about this opportunity?\n\nWhy this question is strategic. This is one of the best interview questions to ask candidates because it reveals if they took the time to review the company website and job description.\n\n\"If they are unable to articulate why they want the job at your company, it will create issues during the offer stage,\" says Andy. \"It's possible they may be overlooking details of the role itself and solely looking at the compensation package.\"\n\nWhat to look for in a candidate’s answer. They should understand what the organization does at a surface level and why it inspired them to apply. They should also be able to describe why the role is compelling based on their experience and current situation (i.e., they went through a layoff, they’re looking for something new, they want a chance to advance their career, etc.).\n\n3. What are you looking for in your next role and what will you be assessing about our organization?\n\nWhy this question is strategic. This offers an opportunity to address why your organization is a good fit for the candidate based on what they’re looking for. If you’re a recruiter asking this question, you can take the candidate’s answer to the hiring team so they can address these points in the interview.\n\n\"Interviewing is a two-way street,\" says Christina Vidauri, Senior Technical Recruiter at SeekOut. \"You want the candidate to learn as much as possible about your organization and ensure all their questions are answered throughout the process.\"\n\nWhat to look for in a candidate’s answer. There are no right or wrong answers, but concerns may arise if they don’t mention anything related to the company values, culture, or role.\n\n\"They may be looking for any job, not necessarily one with your organization,\" Christina says. \"As a recruiter, you can take this context to internal stakeholders about extending the offer to the candidate.\"\n\n4. What are your compensation expectations given what you’ve learned about the role so far?\n\nWhy this question is strategic. This is among the most basic interview questions to ask candidates if you’re the recruiter or hiring manager. \"I want to have a transparent conversation up front,\" says Christina. \"This question is not about pinning down a number. Instead, it allows me to determine if we’re within range and explain the organization's compensation philosophy and structure.\"\n\nWhat to look for in a candidate’s answer. A candidate who has done appropriate market research will provide a reasonable range and some flexibility in terms of factoring in your organization’s benefits and equity (if applicable).\n\nStrategic interview questions to ask candidates about their workplace experience\n\nThese candidate interview questions will help you determine how well they might transition into the new role based on their current work situation.\n\n5. What kind of technology have you used in your most recent role and how have you used it?\n\nWhy this question is strategic. If you have a specific technology in mind (e.g., Salesforce, Tableau, SQL, Python, etc.), you can tailor this question to that product specifically. However, it's crucial to also ask how they’ve used the product.\n\n\"You’ll learn in depth how they've applied their technical skills and knowledge of a product in a professional setting,\" Andy says. \"You can’t determine if they’re a good fit only by knowing if they’ve used it.\"\n\nWhat to look for in a candidate's answer. Listen for specific application of the technology, not blanket statements about their experience. Examples may include a project they worked on, a day-to-day use case, and how involved they were (i.e., basic data entry, system admin, expert user).\n\n6. What type of work have you enjoyed the most so far?\n\nWhy this question is strategic. This question is for new graduates or those seeking internship roles. \"Candidates who are in the early stages of their career may not yet know where to place their focus professionally,\" says Christina. \"Learning what they’ve enjoyed doing and why may help you understand the best opportunity for them within your organization.\"\n\nWhat to look for in a candidate’s answer. Their response should be honest and enthusiastic. It’s OK if they carried out a project that focused on one thing but want to explore a project focusing on something else. Their answer should show they are willing to try new things and seek help when they need it.\n\n7. Could you describe the team you work with right now?\n\nWhy this question is strategic. You’ll learn about the candidate's most recent work environment, including the size of their team and the roles and titles within. They may be working at a large company with defined roles and processes or at a smaller company where employees wear different hats and processes aren’t as solidified.\n\nWhat to look for in a candidate’s answer. Christina advises that your aim is to understand how well they could transition to your organization if you offer a different environment than they’ve described.\n\nBehavioral interview questions to ask candidates\n\nBehavioral questions are some of the best interview questions to ask candidates because they focus on their response to a specific, real-life situation. These can also double as personality interview questions to ask candidates since the answers will give you a view into how they manage things like stress, roadblocks, or conflict.\n\n8. Tell me about an especially difficult problem you had to solve.\n\nWhy this question is strategic. “Work Rules!” author Laszlo Bock says this is his favorite question to ask candidates and he uses it in every interview. \"It gives me a sense of their general cognitive ability, which is known to predict 27% of job performance. It's the biggest single predictor,\" says Laszlo. \"I also get meta information about how hard somebody thinks the problem was.\"\n\nWhat to look for in a candidate's answer. Their answer should tell you how they assessed the challenge, how they found a solution, and how they solved the problem. Ideally, they'll share an example that's not team-based but more specific to their actions as an individual.\n\n9. Tell me about a time you worked on a project under a tight deadline.\n\nWhy this question is strategic. This is one of the most effective interview questions to ask because it can reveal several candidate skills, including time management, problem-solving, organization, and team communication.\n\nWhat to look for in a candidate's answer. They should be able to walk you through a project or task from beginning to end with the steps they took to complete it on time, including how they communicated with the team throughout the process and how they managed unexpected issues that may have occurred.\n\n10. Tell me how you work in a team environment with a variety of priorities and opinions.\n\nWhy this question is strategic. You can assess someone’s philosophy on working in a collaborative environment: Are they order-givers? Are they unwilling to speak up when working with others? Are they someone who will be a positive addition to your culture?\n\nWhat to look for in a candidate's answer: \"They should reveal an example showing how they’ve navigated this type of environment in the past or in their current role,\" says Andy. \"Pending the role and responsibilities, you want to know if someone will use their voice but also listen to others and encourage healthy collaboration.\"\n\n11. Tell me about a time when you had to learn a new skill at work.\n\nWhy this question is strategic. You’ll get an idea how proactive the candidate may be on the job when it comes to tackling unfamiliar projects: Are they open to exploring new skills? How do they go about learning something quickly? How do they adapt to tough situations?\n\nWhat to look for in a candidate's answer. Your aim is to understand whether the candidate is willing to leave their comfort zone and how they approach turning a problem into an opportunity. They should show excitement to try new things and demonstrate how they currently use that skill or what they took away from the experience overall.\n\nSelf-awareness questions to ask candidates\n\nThis set of strategic interview questions to ask candidates focuses on self-reflection: how well does the candidate know their strengths and weaknesses and how will knowing these qualities help them in this role?\n\n12. What are your areas of opportunity for growth?\n\nWhy this question is strategic. \"I love this question because it shows me how self-aware the person is and what steps they are taking to improve,\" says Lainie Marte, HR Senior Talent Acquisition Manager at Best Buy. \"You’d be surprised how much this question reveals about the person.\"\n\nWhat to look for in a candidate's answer. You’ll learn how willing they are to grow professionally, how they may respond to feedback from managers or team members, and their approach to being action oriented. They should describe their area of growth in detail, not offer something vague.\n\n13. What’s something you believe you do really well?\n\nWhy this question is strategic. You’ll gauge the candidate’s confidence in their abilities and determine if their strengths align with responsibilities of the future role.\n\nWhat to look for in a candidate's answer. Think of this answer as an opportunity for them to show you why they’re the best person for the job. Ideally, they will choose a skill that speaks to a required job responsibility listed in the job posting.\n\n14. What’s a professional accomplishment you’re most proud of?\n\nWhy this question is strategic. You’ll gain insight into the candidate’s values, skills, work ethic, and what they consider important in their career.\n\nWhat to look for in a candidate's answer. Their answer should speak to your organization’s needs and demonstrate skills that are relevant to the role. Listen for specific ways that their greatest accomplishment positively impacted their organization.\n\n15. What are the most important values and ethics that you demonstrate as a leader?\n\nWhy this question is strategic. This is a favorite interview question of Kelli Stillwell, Lead Recruiter at IBM. While this is geared more toward managers or executives, you can rephrase this for individual contributor roles as \"Tell me about a time that you demonstrated leadership skills.\" The strategy is the same: you want to get a sense of how the candidate will lead a team or whether they have potential to lead a team in the future.\n\nWhat to look for in a candidate answer. Candidates should offer the reasons for anything they list along with examples that demonstrate how each has benefited the teams they have led or how it has supported their work.\n\nBonus: Strategy interview questions\n\nThese are good interview questions to ask a candidate who is applying for more strategy-focused roles. You'll identify how they build and lead projects that align with the needs of the business. You'll get insight into their decision-making process and how they include stakeholders.\n\n16. What key factors do you consider when creating an action plan?\n\nWhy this question is strategic. Action plans keep teams aligned and on track to meet deadlines. This question will highlight the candidate's organizational and cross-collaboration skills and how well they understand the strategy behind the plan they're creating as it relates to business goals.\n\nWhat to look for in a candidate answer. Candidates should be able to give an example of a well-executed plan they've recently led and why it was prioritized. They should also take you through how they determined tasks, which teams they looped in and why, and whether or not deadlines were met.\n\n17. Could you tell me about a time you had to influence leadership to adopt a strategic plan?\n\nWhy this question is strategic. You'll understand how well they can defend their position and how they ensure leadership is included in the decision-making process.\n\nWhat to look for in a candidate answer. The candidate should reveal why leadership was hesitant and how they were able to ease doubts using experience, data, or success stories, and how it all aligned with company goals.\n\n18. How do you measure a strategy's effectiveness?\n\nWhy this question is strategic. Strategies can't improve without understanding how they performed. You'll learn whether the candidate thinks through strategy-building holistically beyond the launch of a project.\n\nWhat to look for in a candidate's answer. They may talk about the goals and KPIs that were established from the beginning of the project and any relevant data they gathered to determine whether those targets were met. They should explain how they analyzed the data and whether they included any stakeholders to offer a diverse set of perspectives.\n\nHow to ask the most effective interview questions\n\nOnce you’ve compiled your list of strategic interview questions to ask candidates, we recommend leaving some space to ask simple follow-up questions. For example, you may want clarification from the candidate by asking:\n\nWhy is that?\n\nWhy did you decide to go that route?\n\nWhat was the result?\n\nWhat challenges did you face with that?\n\nDid it work?\n\n\"This tactic is especially useful if people give very concise answers,\" says Andy. \"You don't want to just move on. Instead, make sure you get an answer that offers all the information you need, even if it isn't the ‘right’ answer.\"\n\nMake 2025 the year you jump from recruiter to strategic talent advisor. Here's how to level up:",
      "# [Reinventing Recruiting: SeekOut’s Anoop Gupta on the Rise of Agentic AI by Coral Garnick on 2025-04-24](https://www.madrona.com/rise-of-agentic-ai-in-recruiting-seekout-anoop-gupta/)\nThis week, Madrona Managing Director Soma Somasegar sat down with Anoop Gupta, the co-founder and CEO of SeekOut — a company at the forefront of agentic AI in recruiting, redefining how organizations discover, hire, and manage talent.\n\nIn this conversation, Soma and Anoop explore how SeekOut has evolved its platform to include SeekOut Spot, an agentic AI solution that reduces the time it takes to move from job description to qualified candidates — from 45 days down to just three. Together, these two long-time friends unpack lessons on building an AI-native company, navigating changing market dynamics, and what it takes to deliver real outcomes in a sea of AI hype.\n\nListen on Spotify, Apple, and Amazon | Watch on YouTube\n\nThis transcript was automatically generated and edited for clarity.\n\nSoma: Anoop, you have truly an eclectic background, starting with, initially, academic, then a startup, then a large company, and now back to a startup. Why don’t you introduce yourself a little bit to the audience and also talk about what you do at SeekOut and what SeekOut does?\n\nAnoop: I’m Anoop, I’m a geek and an entrepreneur. I got my PhD from Carnegie Mellon in computer science. I was in the faculty of computer science at Stanford. And then did my first startup in ’95. We were one of the first companies doing streaming media. When the modems were still 56K modems and it was a wonderful time at Stanford. That company was acquired by Microsoft in ’97. SeekOut is a talent business. We focus on helping companies build winning teams and fill the talent gaps. We look at talent very holistically from external talent, internal talent, how to retain, grow, and recruit people. We are used by some of the top brands. We have over 700 customers, who is who in tech, in defense, in pharma. We feel really privileged that they used us as their recruiting and talent solution.\n\nThe Role of Agentic AI in Recruiting\n\nSoma: Now, to remind people, as much as we think AI has been around for the last 100 years, it was really only five years since the transformer revolution, so to speak, happened and the large language models came into existence. Even before all that happened, you were thinking about SeekOut as an AI-first company. You’re going from like, “Hey, how can AI help you,” to , “Hey, how can AI do it for you,” kind of thing, right? Some people refer to it as agentic AI or what have you. Tell us a little bit about what got you started on AI from day one and how you evolved with the changes in technology and the innovation that’s happening at a pretty fast pace.\n\nAnoop: If you look at talent, there’s a lot of data. You’ve got to understand the data. The data is noisy. Even if you think about you went to the University of Pennsylvania, do you say Wharton, Pennsylvania. If you’re doing diversity classifiers. The early AI was in data cleansing, in data combining, in classifiers, in everything in how do you build the most amazing search engine in the world. So that is where we started. As the time has gone along, especially, the second thing was, “Oh, LLMs are there and you just give it a job description and it can build searches for you.” But it has fundamentally changed with agentic AI.\n\nThe thing is that recruiting in some sense, and actually any talent job, whether you’re thinking succession planning, anything, is a very predictable thing. You look at a job description, you talk to the hiring manager to understand the needs. You go and search a large landscape, you go and evaluate hundreds of thousands of people, you reach out in very hyper personalized ways, and you do that and that magic agentic AI is very good. Vertical AI is very good. And that’s where we can bring the time from a job description to initial candidates you’re interviewing from 30, 45 days to three days. That is the magic. It’s a transformational jump.\n\nSoma: I’ve heard you consistently tell me this, Anoop, for a while now. Companies that don’t take a step back and reimagine how they are going after recruiting talent and managing talent, they’re going to be left behind. Why do you think now is the time for companies to embrace agentic AI solutions to reimagine how they could go about talent acquisition and what is the urgency here?\n\nAnoop: Yeah. So, Soma, the world is changing. Every industry is changing, every business is changing. People are refining their strategies and saying, “We’ve got to adopt AI, or we’ve got to do this thing differently otherwise.” Now all of this evolving, changing business strategy, you’ve got to have a talent strategy. You got to say, “Do I have the right people in the seat now the speed of change has become, and the speed at which the companies need to change has increased?” In this world where things are changing, it becomes urgent for the talent organizations to say, “What am I going to do differently to deliver talent quickly that’s high quality so the right people are in the right seat?” One more angle just quickly I would add to that is there is a lot of pressure on all organizations that AI is coming, how are you becoming more effective, more efficient? That is another pressure that people are feeling on how to do more with less.\n\nSoma: You guys have recently launched SeekOut Spot. I’m super excited about that. In fact, I’m proud to say in this forum that we were probably one of the earliest customers of SeekOut Spot and we are happy customers. Tell me a little bit about that. Tell me how you came up with that, because there is a growing trend here where people are talking about not just software as service, but service as software with AI playing a key role. Tell me a little bit about the genesis of SeekOut Spot and what does it do for companies, organizations, and talent leaders.\n\nBusiness Model and Flexibility\n\nAnoop: When we start with the business leader and what they care about is the right hires with speed and quality that is there. The magic of AI agents is outcomes as the delivery thing, and not, “Here is a tool that your people have to use.” The fundamental thing, from a business model, is the focus on outcomes. Now there is a lot of flexibility because it’s a combination of people and the AI agents that are happening. We have supported a lot of different models. We will deliver you a hire and that is pricing costs associated with it. We can say we will augment the sources that you have. Maybe you need fewer sources, or when the demand is changing, we can come and help you.\n\nThere’s a lot of flexibility of business models, but they’re all outcome-based that we deliver for them. To dig in a little bit, what does the recruiting task look like? How do you engage with the talent? That is interesting. Our recruiters tell us, by the time they’ve done the 10th message, their eyeballs dry out, fall off, and roll across the table. It is crazy the amount of hard work and crazy work that you have to do as a recruiter. With SeekOut Spot, the recruiters focus on the tasks they love, talking to the hiring managers, talking to the humans, selling to the candidates what needs to be done and Spot takes over everything in the middle, delivering your results faster and with higher quality.\n\nSoma: That’s awesome. Sounds truly magical, but help us walk through the shift here. SeekOut Spot in my mind is a classic example of service as a software. Tell me what is the business model changes here and why is it the right thing for your customers?\n\nAnoop: The business model change is we deliver hires or we deliver you strong candidates for this thing. That is the outcome. Eventually, what the talent leader and the business leader are looking for is, “Did you get me a hire? Are they great? Are they the right fit?” They don’t care when it’s taking six weeks. The average for a technical hire by Ashby is 83 days for a hire, and for non-technical, it’s around 63. That’s a long time, and that’s just the median. Many things take longer. So this can be so much faster and better.\n\nSoma: As you know, Madrona wanted to hire a data scientist a few months ago, and whenever we think about hiring a position, my mental model is, “Hey, I’ll be happy if we can hire somebody in the next 90 days.” 180 days maybe, but 90 days would be like, “I’ll be thrilled,”. This hire, the data scientist hire, from start to finish, I think, took less than four weeks for us.\n\nI was amazed at the speed and the quality of the candidates that we saw through the process. It all happened amazingly well for us. Thank you to you and to SeekOut Spot, we made that hire and that person is on board for the last few months and we are thrilled with him so far. So tell me, you mentioned earlier, this goes from 30 days or 45 days to three days, right? We’ve seen at least one example in our environment where we’ve been able to hire a high quality data scientist in about three and a half weeks from start to finish kind of thing.\n\nAnoop: Basically what we can do, and this technology is, from the kickoff meeting with the hiring manager to the initial candidates you’re interviewing, on the fourth day. So that is the magic. Now the hiring, making the offer takes a little bit of time. We have had Discord, which is getting amazing results. We had a startup named Shaped.ai, which is getting hires within three weeks with the initial… And they’re amazed at it. If you look at the quotes on our website, we have Discord, 1Password, HP, Shaped, and Madrona. Even though it’s early, we are seeing real proof that there’s magic in here.\n\nSoma: The other thing that I’ve heard you say, Anoop, when I was over to your place for the SKO, you mentioned, “Hey, with SeekOut Spot, we can deliver a 5 to 10X productivity for recruiters,” or talent acquisition, people kind of thing, right? Talk to me a little bit about that.\n\nRecruiting Process and Efficiency\n\nAnoop: Basically, here is how the recruiting process works. The recruiter talks to the hiring manager, understands the role, then they build a mental model of what they need to do, do some search, come back, do some search, send some messages, and that cycle goes on. In SeekOut, on the first day, after you talk to the hiring manager, you have this success rubric. You have explored automatically thousands of candidates, you’ve evaluated each one of them and we give you a spider graph and how they’re doing across each of the rubric elements, and you have sent out messages.\n\nThat thing, I’m saying 5 to 10X, that takes a long time for a recruiter, and that time is being compressed to the benefit of the recruiter and the customer. I’ll tell you, we have specialized, in this service, of course, there’s technology, but we also have recruiters who operate this technology because they’re some tasks that humans do best. They’re the happiest, most energized recruiters, because, “I’m doing what I love and I’m delivering results quickly.” It is pretty amazing how everyone is happier, the business leader, the talent leader, the recruiter. So it’s exciting to us.\n\nSoma: That is great. We’ve been talking about human in the loop for a while now and with something like SeekOut Spot, what you’re really telling organizations is like, “Hey, recruiters are highly valuable. Let them focus on things that they need to focus on. And I’m going to give you agentic AI solution or AI agents that is going to work in conjunction with your talent people to be able to get things done better, faster, all that fun stuff. This notion of hybrid model where you have AI agents working with human beings, that seems like a great model to drive forward as it relates to recruiting and talent acquisition, right?\n\nAnoop: Yes.\n\nSoma: If I’m a recruiter today or a talent acquisition professional, and I see the world of agentic AI, you could argue like, it’s going to disrupt my world, or you could say, it’s going to reimagine what is possible and get me to do what I need to do much, much, much better, 10X better, whatever it is, what should I take away from this as a recruiter or a talent acquisition person and how should I be prepared for this wave of innovation to come?\n\nAnoop: So here’s the way. Do what is human and only humans can do and become the best at it. One is it means when you talk to the hiring manager, how can you be an advisor? Ask hard questions. Do you really mean this? Do you really want this? What is this person going to do? If you feel confident, expert, and good at that, that is one side of it. The second is when you’re talking to a candidate, right? How do you sell? How do you say what is inspiring? How do you say what are you going to do? Why is this a great company for you or not? I think those are the skills you have to become very good at. A lot of them, messy middle, which is critical and important, AI agents will do a great job for you.\n\nSoma: That’s cool. That’s a good way to frame and think about it. I always tell this, Anoop, to every founder or every startup, in the history of this world, there isn’t a single company which has always had a smooth journey. There are good days, there are amazing days, there are okay days, there are lousy days and everything in between.\n\nIn your journey over the last, say, seven years or so, you’ve gone through some amazing highs, some not so great lows, and everything in between. How did you and your co-founder, Aravind, how did you guys navigate through this and are there any takeaways or learnings or ahas that you would like to share that will be valuable for other founders where every founder goes through this?\n\nNavigating Challenges and Product-Market Fit\n\nAnoop: We had an early phase of it where we were in hypergrowth, exponential growth, and then the economic malaise, the market change, and we went through some flat portions and now we are on a path to hypergrowth again. What are the things that you need to do? I think the most important thing is continuously watching a product market fit. When the market changed, the environment changed, what was needed changed, it took us a little while to say, “How do we do?” Because market always wins. You can have a great team and the market is this thing you’re not going to succeed in. You can have a lousy team, but you’re aligned with the market, you’re going to win. So one key message is watch for market fit. Just because you have market fit once doesn’t mean you’re maintaining.\n\nThe other is to have a sense of confidence and always iterating and experimenting and keeping calm. Your organization comes along with you. That bad stage shouldn’t ruin, though you have to be very conscious about managing your expenses and how you are doing. I want to point to one piece advice, which was maybe a thing for the times. When we were raising a series B, or series C, we had not spent any money that we had raised. And you said, “Go ahead and raise it anyway. It’s good times.” And that helped us too. We’ve never had to be in a desperate situation, not that we don’t want to be scrappy, or want to be conscious. That has given us a comfort and a cushion and that was very wise advice to us.\n\nSoma: Thank you. There are two elements to that, Anoop. One is you want to raise money when you don’t need to raise money, that’s always the best time to do it. The second time is what you said is one of the reasons I was excited about us raising that money was because I’ve seen how you and Aravind have been very scrappy. I wasn’t worried about if there was a little more money than what you need today, would bad behavior set in in terms of spending. Right? It doesn’t matter how much money there is in the bank or not in the bank. I think as entrepreneurs, as founders, as what I call efficient stewards of capital, you have to always be thoughtful about that. I say this right now, hey, your increase in investment should warrant a return on that investment. If you’re confident about that, go do that. If not, you have to be really thoughtful.\n\nI’m so glad whenever you raise your CDC and that has helped you tie through the last year or so to put yourself back in hypergrowth mode. That’s fantastic. Going hand in hand with raising is also a more thoughtful deployment of capital.\n\nAnoop: I totally agree. We always feel like it’s our own money, we have a responsibility.\n\nSoma: Are there any lessons from your own journey? I truly believe that you guys were AI-first from day one, as I said, well before the Transformers and large language models came into existence. Any guidance or advice that you would give to founders today when people are thinking about like, “Hey, I want to ride this AI wave. I want to truly be an AI-first company,” what should they do or what should they not do?\n\nFounders: Focus on Outcomes, not on Hype\n\nAnoop: My advice to founders and actually to the customers that we have, or prospects, is to focus on outcomes, not on the hype. If I were advising this thing, and because everybody’s put AI in their marketing materials, I say look for the outcomes. What are the outcomes you’re delivering? Get to the success stories, shout those out from the rooftops — that focus on outcomes is really important. In the recruiting space, we have a lot of companies that would talk about, “We are AI. We are agentic AI,” and all they have done is maybe an LLM, and they give a natural language query, and something comes out. That is not the end solution. Part of the vertical AI is looking at the whole workflow and process that results in the outcomes. What I would say is, don’t use it as a buzzword, genuinely create value for your customers. That is the thing to do. There is a lot of power in what’s coming, but focus on the customer’s problems and outcomes.\n\nSoma: When people are thinking about AI, and I agree with you completely, focus on the outcome and not the activity alone, how important is what I call a data moat? Do I need to necessarily have either what I call proprietary data or a data moat if I’m an AI-first company, or I don’t need to have that?\n\nAnoop: I think there’s different kinds of data. A lot of data is available, everybody has data. One is the experience moat. As you work with clients and you get the proprietary data from the customer and the client and how you integrate it and how easily you can do that, so it becomes not your data moat and some base data that you have. Our one example would be, in recruiting, it’s not just external data, how do you integrate with the applicant tracking systems and the data that customers have, or their internal employee data and how do you bring that or how do you integrate with specialized resources and partners, whether it’s healthcare and nursing data. I think the data moat comes from delivering outcomes and the learnings, and that learnings and the data becomes also a moat.\n\nSoma: If I take you at face value, you’re telling this from the rooftop that, every investor should be talking to their portfolio company about, “what is your talent acquisition strategy”? How are you reimagining in this world of agentic AI?'” What would you want to tell investors?\n\nDon’t build a recruiting org too early\n\nAnoop: I think building a recruiting org too early is not good because your demand is going to fluctuate. The quality and the people that you need will fluctuate. These are specialized roles. What a startup should have is probably one recruiting manager and recruiting coordinator that they have where the interface to the hiring managers and scheduling interviews and calendaring, work with somebody like SeekOut. Because in startups, the right hires are really important. The cost of a bad hire is so much more than just, “Here is what I did.” If you can get high-quality hires in two weeks, three weeks, that makes a difference to your business outcome. I would invite, it’ll sound a little bit selfish as I am saying it, come and check us out, talk to us. I think it can make a big difference.\n\nSoma: I want to underscore one point that you made. For every organization, every company, this is true, but it is even more true for a startup because you have finite assets of resources. Every right hire can be a true force multiplier.\n\nI truly believe it’s extremely important for startups, particularly the early stages of the company, to ensure that, and everybody goes through this way. Nobody bats 1000. There’s always hiring mistakes, but you want to minimize that and truly understand that every great hire is going to be a true force multiplier for your company.\n\nAnoop: Yes, it is so important.\n\nSoma: From your vantage point, particularly as a hiring manager, what do you think the biggest hiring mistakes that companies today are making?\n\nAnoop: One is company strategies change. Hiring strong, fungible engineers and marketers who can change as your strategy changes is really important. That is the thing you need to do. The second thing we have found is attitude is really important. People who understand the ambiguity, who can take the punches, roll with the punches, adapt and adjust, and are there and get shit done. Those things are also super critical in the hires that you make.\n\nSoma: Now the other side of the audience is usually founders, either existing founders or new founders or people who are thinking that in the next 6 to 12 months, they want to be founders. What is your message to them?\n\nAnoop: My message to founders is, one is before you hire, try and do the job yourself in some of the cases. I did a lot of sales, I’ve never done sales before, and I became an expert because I didn’t know how to hire a sales person. That was one thing on the talent side that I did. Then there were many cases where I had no expertise. Let’s say on a sales leader CRO. I leveraged people at Madrona and said, “Would you interview this person for me?” You want to leverage your connections and contacts who are experts in that so that you can get a good sense of what it needs to be.\n\nMy recommendation is, to the people who are thinking to be founders, that the initial team is super critical. Become familiar yourself before you jump into hiring all those people at a level of detail so that you know what is the right thing you need. The salesperson you need for one startup versus another varies a lot. You have to say, “What is your selling motion, who is you need,” and understand that deeply, and second, leverage your friends to do that, and then leverage the right people who can feed you that talent.\n\nSoma: How can I get in touch with you, Anoop, if I’m a founder or investor and want to learn more?\n\nAnoop: Okay, it’s simple. My email is [email protected]. You can find me on LinkedIn, connect with me and we’ll love to talk to you and show you. Because seeing is believing. Everybody talks so much. I’m just such a passionate thinker that seeing is believing, come and see, come and experience, and we would love to partner with you.\n\nSoma: As we come to an end in this episode, Anoop, I want to congratulate you on pushing the boundaries and pushing the envelope on what AI can do for talent acquisition for organizations of all sizes and in all industries. Is there a final word that you would want to say to people, whether they are in a smaller environment like a startup or a bigger environment like an enterprise as to what they should do about talent management and talent acquisition as they look ahead?\n\nAgentic AI for recruiting is here\n\nAnoop: Agentic AI for recruiting is here and now. I would say experiment with it. This is the time. Be early before the change is thrust upon you. Be the lean-forward leader, experimenting, and adapting, and flowing with the transformation versus being hit by it when somebody comes and says you’re too late. The world is changing, and it is changing in amazing, wonderful ways, that is don’t get stuck in the old world to the extent you can avoid that and look broadly on what needs to be done. Especially for the large enterprises, the transformation is going to be very huge, and even for small companies. So, my final word, this will sound very selfish, contact us. We’ll show you what we can do for you as you explore all of the different options that are out there so that you’re getting the right tires and kicking the ball out of the field.\n\nSoma: First of all, even before I wrap this up, thank you for allowing me to partner with you and Aravind for the last seven years or so. It’s been a fabulous journey. So many learnings and so much success. For all the progress we’ve made, I think we are still in early stages and there is so much more that we can do, and I’m looking forward to that. Thank you so much for joining us here today, and thanks to everybody for listening and we’ll see you again soon.",
